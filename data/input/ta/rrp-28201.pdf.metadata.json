The SCUs will promote savings mobilization\nand provide small and generally short- to medium-term loans. The\nProject offers an alternative for access to financial services to the\nrural  population,  including  the  poor,  who  are  unable  to  receive\nfinancial services from other formal financial institutions. The Project\nencourages the participation of the poor by setting membership fees\nat an affordable level ($5) and directing promotional and training\nefforts to the poor. A credit union service organization (CUSO) will\npromote SCU development and will provide training and capacity\nbuilding within newly formed SCUs. A supervision development unit\n(SDU) will undertake SCU supervision and regulation to create a\nmore secure environment for SCU operation. The CUSO and SDU\nactivities will be coordinated by a project management unit (PMU) to\nbe established under the Project. The need for information in rural\nareas will be addressed by establishing information resource centers\n(IRCs) in four pilot aimags (provinces). The Project will have a pilot\nphase of three years in four aimags (Arhangay, Dundgovi, Dzavhan,\nand Sukhbaatar) before going nationwide with the second phase.\nClassification Poverty intervention\nEnvironmental Category  B.  The  potential  negative  environmental  impacts  of\nAssessment subprojects that may be financed under the Project were reviewed\nand found to be easily mitigated.\nRationale At present most of the rural population do not have access to formal\nsavings and credit services; only about 3 percent have access to\ncredit services from a bank or Government institutions. The financial\nsector faces many constraints in terms of liquidity and institutional\ncapability, and delivery mechanisms in rural areas cannot satisfy the\ndemand for financial services, particularly for those without collateral,\nincluding the poor and small enterprises. The informal sector also\nprovides credit, but at a high cost. Thus alternative formal financial\ninstitutions are needed to offer a range of financial services on a\nsustainable basis. Such institutions must have a strong community\nfocus to overcome existing negative social attitudes to credit and\nfinancial institutions which have developed in recent years due to\nfailures in the banking system. The Government recognizes the need\nto revive the rural sector and sees microfinance playing a pivotal\nrole. The establishment of a national SCU network is regarded as a\nviable alternative form of financial intermediation in rural areas.", "iii\nAn unsupervised savings and credit union movement is emerging in\nMongolia upon which a more solid, well-planned expansion of the\nsystem can be built. For SCUs to achieve significant outreach and\nlong-term sustainability, the provision of financial services should\nencompass savings mobilization that provides resources at lower\ncosts  than  borrowing  from  commercial  sources  and  is  more\nsustainable than externally funded credit lines that may be available\nonly over a limited time frame. The introduction of incentives in the\nform of secure deposit facilities and interest rates that provide a real\nreturn on deposits will enable a significant volume of these savings\nto enter the financial system through SCUs. Monetizing the economy\nand  providing  local  financial  intermediation  are  as  much  a\nprerequisite to developing the rural economy as is increasing the\nsupply  of  credit  available  to  farmers  and  other  rural  residents.\nEstablishing low minimum share contributions for SCU membership\nwill also facilitate access to financial services for the rural poor who\nare effectively excluded from access to alternative savings and credit\ninstitutions. The development of an SCU supervision and regulation\ncapability  under  the  Project  will  offer  improved  protection  for\nmembers\u2019 shares and savings in SCUs.\nObjectives and Scope The long-term objective of the Project is to develop a sustainable\nrural financial system that will contribute to both economic growth\nand poverty reduction. The Project has two purposes: (i) to increase\nthe availability of and access to savings and credit services in rural\nareas and among the poor, and (ii) to provide a focal point for rural\ncommunities  to  access  information  and  resources  to  support\neconomic activities to be financed by SCUs, and satisfy socially\nrelated information and training needs.\nThe Project has three components: (i) development of rural SCUs;\n(ii) establishment of information and resource centers (IRCs); and\n(iii) capacity building in project management. The Project will initially\nbe implemented on a pilot basis over three years in four aimags\n(Arhangay,  Dundgovi,  Dzavhan,  and  Sukhbaatar)  and  expanded\nnationwide during the remaining four years of the Project.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $15.0 million equivalent,\nof  which  $3.2  million  (22  percent)  equivalent  will  be  in  foreign\nexchange and $11.8 million (78 percent) equivalent in local currency.\nThe relatively high level of local currency is considered acceptable\nfor  financing  as  Mongolia,  due  to  its  low  per  capita  income,  is\nclassified as a least-developed country under the United Nations\nsystem, and such member countries of the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) are given priority in ADB\u2019s local currency financing policy.", "iv\nFinancing Plan ($ \u2018000)\nForeign Local\nSource Exchange Currency Total Percent\nADB 3,242 5,444 8,686 58\nGovernment 0 715 715 5\nCUSO 0 384 384 3\nSCUs 0 4,866 4,866 32\nNGOs 0 349 349 2\nTotal 3,242 11,758 15,000 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, NGO = nongovernment organization,\nSCU = savings and credit union.\nLoan Amount and Terms A loan of SDR6.854 million ($8.7 million equivalent) is proposed from\nthe Special Funds resources of ADB.

The loan will\nhave a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and\nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1 percent per annum during the\ngrace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nRelending and The  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economy  (MOFE)  will  relend  the\nOnlending Terms proceeds  of  the  project  line  of  credit  to  participating  financial\ninstitutions (PFIs) (which will initially be commercial banks) in local\ncurrency at a rate of interest that covers cost of funds, administration\ncosts, foreign exchange and interest variation risks, an allowance for\ninflation, and a charge to be transferred to a fund administered by\nthe PMU for financing SCU promotion and training. Loans to SCUs\nand subsequently sublending to members will be at rates of interest\nthat  cover  the  cost  of  funds  and  include  an  allowance  for\nadministration costs, loan loss provision, credit risk, and commercial\nmargin.\nLoans to the PFIs will be for one to five years. The PFIs will onlend\nto individual SCUs for up to five years, but loans will initially be\nlimited  to  a  maximum  period  of  one  year  until  the  SCU  has\ndeveloped a credit history and acceptable repayment performance.\nSubject  to  satisfactory  performance  and  agreement  between  the\nCUSO, PFIs, and PMU, loan terms may be extended. Indicative\ninterest rates charged by MOFE to the PFIs would be about 12\npercent; from PFIs to SCUs, about 24 percent; and from SCUs to\nmembers, about 36 percent. Interest rates will fluctuate depending\non financial market conditions.\nPeriod of Utilization 30 June 2009\nExecuting Agency Ministry of Finance and Economy\nImplementation MOFE,  as  the  Executing  Agency,  will  be  responsible  for  overall\nArrangements Project  coordination.

PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to Mongolia for the Rural Finance Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In response to a request from the Government, the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nfinanced a project preparatory technical assistance (TA)1 to review the status of rural financial\nservices and to design a project to address the lack of availability of and access to financial\nservices  for  rural  communities.  The  TA  determined  that  the  development  of  a  system  of\ncommunity-based  savings  and  credit  unions  (SCUs)  with  complementary  support  for  apex\norganizations, and the establishment of an appropriate legal and regulatory framework offered\nthe greatest potential for delivering financial services in rural areas in the short to medium term.\nThe Fact-Finding Mission was fielded in March 2001 to review the design of the Project and to\ndevelop the policy dialogue with the Government. The Appraisal Mission was fielded in June\n2001.2\n3. This report is based upon the results of the TA and ADB field visits and discussions with\nstakeholders in Government, rural communities, the emerging SCU movement, nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs), and other interested groups. For the purposes of the Project, rural is\nunderstood  to  mean  all  areas  outside  the  capital  city  of  Ulaanbaatar  and  includes  aimag\n(province) centers. The project framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  The Economy\n4. Mongolia\u2019s economy has made good progress during the past 10 years of its transition\nfrom a command economy and a single political party to a democratic and market-based\neconomic system. This adjustment has been difficult with the economy initially contracting\nsharply due to the loss of assistance from the former Soviet Union\u2014the equivalent of 30 percent\nof gross domestic product (GDP). By 1993, agricultural production had decreased by half, and\nboth industrial output and per capita GDP had declined by a third. The collapse of the state\nbudget followed and led to significantly reduced spending in the health, education, and social\nservice sectors. Annual inflation reached a high of 325 percent in 1993. Unemployment grew as\na consequence of the closure of many state enterprises and redundancies in national and local\nadministrations.\n5. The economy started to recover in 1994 mainly due to the proactive role of the private\nsector in the agriculture, manufacturing, and service sectors. The average real growth rate for\n1994-1999  was  3.5  percent.  However,  in  2000,  the  agriculture  sector,  the  most  important\neconomic sector, contracted by 16.8 percent as a consequence of two successive extremely\nharsh winters (dzud) during which about 10 percent of livestock was lost, affecting the livelihood\nof nearly 20 percent of the population. The nonagriculture sectors, on the other hand, registered\n                  \n1  TA 3397-MON: Rural Finance, for $700,000, approved on 22 February 2000. The TA was implemented from\nSeptember to December 2000.\n2  The Mission comprised J. Tokeshi, Project Economist and Mission Leader; S. Wendt, Social Development\nSpecialist; and staff consultants: L. Ito, Credit Union Specialist, and M. Lloyd, Financial Economist.", "22\na growth rate of 13 percent, mainly due to the favorable international price of copper and the\nstrong  performance  of  service  industries  such  as  transport  and  communication,  financial\nservices, and wholesale and retail trade. Due to the strength of the nonagriculture sectors,\noverall GDP growth in 2000 was positive at a rate of 1.1 percent, compared with 3.5 percent in\n1998 and 3.2 percent in 1999.\n6. The Government addressed the declining trend in growth by giving priority to restoring\nmacroeconomic stability. As a result of the policies to restructure public expenditures, the\nbudget deficit, which was about 12.2 percent of GDP in 1999, was reduced to 6.9 percent in\n2000. The growth of money supply slowed to 18.1 percent, compared with 35 percent in 1999.\nInflation, which had been declining from 37 percent in 1997 to 7.6 percent in 1999, rose to 11.6\npercent in 2000 due to a sharp increase in international oil prices.\n7. The current account deficit increased from $124 million in 1999 to $165 million in 2000,\nin spite of a 17 percent increase in exports caused by a rise in the international price of copper.\nThe deficit originated with a 20 percent increase in imports, which was attributable to the strong\ngrowth of the nonagriculture sectors, sharp increase in international oil prices, and large inflow\nof emergency aid for disaster relief provided by the international community to combat the\neffects of the dzud. The large inflow of official grants also led to a surplus in the balance of\npayments and an increase in the gross official foreign exchange reserves, from $157 million at\nthe end of 1999 to $191 million (equivalent to about 14 weeks of imports) at the end of 2000.\nExternal debt has remained stable at around $850 million, or 88 percent of GDP.\n8. Poverty increased in the early 1990s due to the economic downturn and associated\nunemployment. At present, the percentage of poverty at the national level remains around 36\npercent, equivalent to about 900,000 people.3 Rural poverty, on the other hand, remains at 33\npercent. In geographic terms, the distribution of poverty has shifted to rural aimag centers. By\n1998, 45.2 percent of the population in aimag centers were poor compared with 41.9 percent in\n1995. Over the same period, the percentage of the population in Ulaanbaatar and in rural areas\nthat were reported to be poor decreased slightly. In addition, 26.8 percent of aimag center\npopulations were estimated to be very poor. A discussion of the characteristics of poverty is\npresented in Appendix 2.\n2.  The Rural Economy\n9. Agriculture  accounts  for  37  percent  of  Mongolia\u2019s  GDP;  and  with  agroprocessing\naccounting for a third of foreign exchange earnings. About 65 percent of the population live in\nrural areas and 33 percent of the rural population are poor. During the early years of transition,\nagriculture declined sharply, in line with the rest of the economy (para. 5). But by the end of the\n1990s, it had recovered to its pre-1990 levels of output in real terms. The structure of output in\nagriculture  has  changed  significantly  with  a  shift  away  from  crop  production  to  livestock\nhusbandry. The share of the crop subsector in total agricultural output declined from 23 percent\nin 1989 to 10 percent in 1999 due mainly to the withdrawal of state subsidies and progressive\ndeterioration  of  the  production  infrastructure.  Crop  production  is  based  primarily  upon  the\ncultivation of wheat, Mongolia\u2019s staple food, in the northern and central regions of the country.\nProduction of vegetables, mainly potatoes, on small-scale family plots, is increasing as a means\nof subsistence and cash income from local marketing of small surpluses. The crop sector faces\n                  \n3  Based on data from World Bank. 1998. Living Standards and Measurement Survey. Washington, D.C. According to\nthe National Statistical Office, the poverty line for Ulaanbaatar is MNT17,600 per capita per month (equivalent to\n$0.53 per day), and MNT13,800 to MNT16,400 in other areas of the country ($0.42 to $0.50 per day).", "33\nserious constraints, such as lack of access to credit, lack of inputs, inadequate post harvest\nfacilities, and poorly developed markets. Faced with such constraints, many farmers shifted into\nlivestock husbandry as a means of subsistence. Livestock production is now the dominant\nactivity and is concentrated in extensive herding of sheep, goats, cattle, and horses. However,\nthe harsh environmental conditions make the dependency on livestock very risky as shown by\nthe huge losses of livestock during the dzud.\n10. Agriculture is the main source of income in rural areas and employment in the sector has\nrisen significantly. Its share in total employment increased from a third in 1990 to about 50\npercent in 1999. The increasing level of employment and shift to raising livestock reflects the\ntendency for the unemployed, mainly from former state enterprises and administration, to resort\nto small-scale herding as a means of subsistence in the absence of alternative employment\nopportunities and limited welfare payments from the state.\n11. Economic activity in rural areas outside agriculture includes small-scale agroprocessing\nand  microenterprises  in  areas  such  as  trading,  retailing,  woodworking,  and  tailoring.  Most\nmicroenterprises are small family concerns that operate on a part-time, informal basis as a\nresult of constraints caused by a lack of access to raw materials and credit for both investment\nand working capital. The other main source of employment in rural areas is the public sector,\nincluding local administrations and the education and health sectors. In these sectors too,\nemployees  frequently  need  to  supplement  their  incomes  by  engaging  in  some  informal\neconomic activity, notably petty trading.\n12. In addition to lack of financial services, a crucial constraint faced by rural communities is\naccess  to  reliable  sources  of  information  on  alternative  credit  sources,  employment\nopportunities, and prices and market outlets, particularly for agricultural produce. These limit the\neconomic  potential  of  rural  enterprises.  The  provision  of  such  information  is  seen  as  an\nessential complementary service that must be developed in rural areas.\n3.  Rural Financial Services\na.  Commercial Banks\n13. From the mid-1990s, following a number of high profile bank closures, the public began\nto lose confidence in the banking system and to withdraw deposits on a large scale. The\nbanking system further deteriorated in 1998 resulting from the financial crises in South and\nSoutheast  Asia  and  the  Russian  Federation,  which  adversely  affected  the  profitability  and\nliquidity of major corporate clients. Continuing management and governance problems in key\nbanks, together with inadequate bank supervision and political uncertainty made the situation\nworse. The banking system continues to be weak and is currently unable to serve the rural\nsector, particularly with basic financial services. Although a bank reform program has been\nimplemented, the financial sector is in need of diversification into alternative forms of financial\nintermediation that are closer to and better serve the needs of their clients. Appendix 3 presents\na review of the rural finance sector.\n14. Lending and savings mobilization by commercial banks in rural areas has been very low\nover the last four years. The only bank with a significant branch network in rural areas is the\nAgricultural  Bank  of  Mongolia  (ABM)  which,  following  an  externally  supported  program  of\nrecapitalization, restructuring, and staff training, recommenced lending operations in late 2000.\nBetween mid-November 2000 and mid-February 2001, ABM disbursed 1,026 loans for a total of\n$750,000 equivalent, an average loan size of $730 equivalent. Average loan size in soum", "44\n(district) branches is lower, the lowest being $275 equivalent. Loan terms are between one and\nsix  months  for  a  borrower\u2019s  first  three  loans  and  12  months  for  borrowers  with  a  good\nrepayment record. Interest rates are 5 percent per month for the first three loans and 4 percent\nper month for subsequent loans. Collateral, equal to 150 percent of the loan amount, is required\nas security. Loans are predominantly for trading purposes and medium-sized agricultural and\nagroprocessing enterprises.\n15. During the TA, a rural financial services demand survey covering 600 households was\nundertaken in three representative aimags to determine the current status of financial services\nin rural areas. Only 3 percent of all respondents had received credit from banks or Government\ninstitutions, such as the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, in the previous two years. The\ntotal of all loans received by respondents was only $4,400; 45 percent of which was provided by\nthe  Government\u2019s  Poverty  Alleviation  Program  Office  of  the  National  Poverty  Alleviation\nProgram (NPAP) (para. 31). The average size of these loans was $220 with interest of 3 to 4\npercent per month. At soum centers surveyed, the lack of credit was more severe: only 2\npercent of households had received any form of credit from formal sources.\n16. Savings mobilization by the banking system in rural areas is also low, as indicated by the\nlow level of deposits held in commercial banks. Funds mobilized by the banking system from\noutside Ulaanbaatar accounted for less than 17 percent of all individual deposits at the end of\n1999. Only 1 percent of the survey\u2019s respondents reported depositing cash with a bank. The\nmain reason for households\u2019 unwillingness to keep money in financial institutions is their lack of\ntrust in banks and a preference to keep cash on hand. Many households also prefer to use\nspare cash to purchase consumer durables, converting any surplus cash into household assets.\nThis is common to all rural areas. However, while a third of households reported that they do not\ntrust banks, 81 percent reported that they would use a bank or financial institution if a reliable,\ntrustworthy institution was available to them.\nb.  Nonbank Financial Institutions and the Informal Sector\n17. Other than commercial bank services in rural areas, the main formal source of credit has\nbeen  nonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs)  and  programs  financed  from  the  Government\nbudget, such as the NPAP and the Local Development Fund. These generally have limited\noutreach and insufficient funding to service the total demand for credit in rural areas. The main\nNBFI  operating  in  rural  areas  is  the  Golden  Fund  for  Development  (XAC),  which  was\nestablished under the Micro-Start Program of the United Nations Development Programme.\nXAC aims to reduce poverty by providing microfinance services. XAC has expanded its rural\nnetwork rapidly and covers 12 aimags. However, branches are only located in aimag centers\n(provincial capitals) and the bulk of their lending is to aimag center enterprises. Having also\nstarted with relatively small loans of between $100 and $300, average loan size has been\nincreasing as borrowers graduate to larger loans and longer terms of more than one year.\nNominal interest rates range from 48 to 60 percent per year but additional fees for application,\nloan processing, and collateral notarization raise the effective rate closer to 100 percent. A\nsecond, externally supported NBFI is the Goviin Ekhel, which provides services, including credit,\nto microenterprises in the Gobi regions of the country and is funded by the United States\nAgency for International Development (USAID). Goviin Ekhel also effectively targets the more\nfinancially secure with loan sizes ranging from $900 to $27,000 and interest rates at 48 percent\nper year. The outreach of both XAC and Goviin Ekhel is limited both in terms of their geographic\ncoverage and their penetration of the lower end of the market for credit. They are also prohibited\nby  law  from  taking  deposits;  this  limits  their  potential  to  mobilize  domestic  resources.  To\novercome this, both XAC and Goviin Ekhel plan to restructure to become commercial banks.", "55\n18. In the absence of a significant supply of financial services from formal sources, the major\nsupplier of credit in rural areas is the informal sector, which consists of itinerant traders, kiosk\n(retail  outlet)  operators,  and  in  the  more  densely  populated  aimag  centers,  pawnbroker\noperations. The nature of these operations is such that information on the volume of lending and\nthe impact of the informal sector is scarce. Of the informal suppliers of credit, only pawnbrokers\nare licensed, by the Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE), but they operate with very little\nsupervision. Most are small, family-based operations that typically do not lend more than $1,000\nper client per month. They provide short-term loans at interest rates between 10 and 15 percent\nper month and require collateral in the form of personal property, such as jewelry, carpets, cars,\nor apartments, with a value of twice the amount of the loan. Loans are mostly for consumption\npurposes. The insistence upon collateral means that pawnbroker lending is beyond the means\nof many potential borrowers who are living close to or below the poverty line.\n19. Other informal suppliers of credit are more accessible for poorer households. Traders\nfrequently  provide  household  consumables  and  durables  in  return  for  future  output  from\nagricultural producers. This system is prevalent among herders who produce and sell meat,\nwool, and cashmere under such conditions, frequently under disadvantageous terms. For those\nwith less certain means of income, local kiosks provide small amounts of credit in kind in the\nform of basic necessities. The amounts involved are very small, as little as $10 per month, but\nfor  those  borrowers  who  have  little  or  no  cash  resources,  including  the  unemployed  and\npensioners whose welfare payments are frequently delayed, this is a vital service. Often, a\nborrower\u2019s welfare or pension book will be kept by the kiosk owner as collateral. Interest\ndepends upon a borrower\u2019s personal circumstances.\n20. Finally, self-financing among extended families is also a significant source of credit.\nMongolia has a strong cultural tradition of self-help between family members in times of need.\nFunds are often provided for indeterminate periods with little or no interest expected. The overall\nextent and impact of such financing is not quantifiable.\nc.  Savings and Credit Unions\n21. The first Mongolian SCUs were established in late 1996 and early 1997 supported by\nADB\u2019s Employment Generation Project.4 Initially five were established, four were sponsored by\nNGOs participating in the project and one by a consultant with the project management unit. All\nof the SCUs are in Ulaanbataar.\n22. The first SCUs outside Ulaanbaatar were formed in 1999 following the establishment of\nthe  Cooperative  Training  Center  in  1998  by  the  German  Gesellschaft  fur  Technische\nZusammenarbeit (GTZ), the Soros Foundation, and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation. The\ncenter promotes the concept of multipurpose cooperatives (of which savings and credit services\nare  a  part),  disseminates  international  cooperative  principles,  and  provides  basic  member\ntraining to aimag center cooperatives. When ABM lending in rural areas stopped, the demand\nfor alternative sources of savings and credit services increased. Depositors in ABM\u2019s rural\nbranches also faced increasing difficulty withdrawing their deposits, increasing their distrust of\nthe banking system. In 1998, the Liberal Women\u2019s Brain Pool implemented a program to\npromote SCU formation,5 and currently provides training on SCU concepts and procedures, and\n                  \n4  Loan 1290-MON: Employment Generation Project, for $3.0 million equivalent, approved 16 December 1993 and\nclosed in 1999.\n5  The Liberal Women\u2019s Brain Pool currently has branches in 20 aimags and 200 soum centers.", "66\nmodel bylaws provided by Moncord Savings and Credit Union.6 As new SCUs are only required\nto register with the local tax authority, no central registry or central licensing procedures exist.\nTherefore estimating the number and location of SCUs is difficult. As of March 2001, 86 SCUs\nhad been identified, 37 in rural areas. Details of the credit union movement and its financial\nstatus are provided in Appendix 3.\n23. To oversee the operations of member SCUs and to lobby Government on behalf of the\ncredit union movement, nine Ulaanbaatar-based SCUs established the first apex organization,\nthe Union of Mongolian Savings and Credit Cooperatives (subsequently renamed the National\nConfederation of Credit Unions of Mongolia, NACCUM), in 1998. By April 1999 a faction split\naway to form the Mongolian National Federation of Savings and Credit Unions (MNFSCU).\nNACCUM  was  perceived  to  be  an  urban  organization,  while  MNFSCU  claimed  national\nrepresentation. At present both organizations lack the capacity to provide effective services to\nmembers and most rural SCUs remain unaffiliated to either organization. A third organization,\nNetMon, was created as a credit union service organization by six credit unions, one company,\nand 13 individuals to deliver training and financial services, including credit, that the existing\norganizations could not. NetMon was licensed as an NBFI by Bank of Mongolia (BOM) in July\n2000. The alternative apex organizations, MNFSCU and NACCUM, are registered only as\nNGOs.  NetMon  is  the  only  organization  with  experience  in  lending  to  SCUs,  using  funds\nprovided both by shareholders and through a loan from BOM (using grant funds provided by the\nUnited Nations Development Programme to the Government) agreed in January 2001. It has\ndeveloped internal monitoring skills and encouraged financial discipline in borrowing SCUs\nthrough the application of prudent lending policies. NetMon employs three full-time and one\npart-time staff. It has been able to support staff costs, training, and lending activities from its\nrevenues. An analysis of NetMon and the SCU apex organizations is presented in Appendix 4.\n24. While NACCUM and MNFSCU have been largely unsuccessful in providing services to\nmembers, they did successfully join with other organizations representing, for instance, farmers,\nherders, and consumer cooperatives to lobby Government to repeal the SCU portion of the\nNBFI Regulation issued by BOM in April 1999. SCUs felt that the regulations with regard to\nlicensing,  audit,  and  reporting  requirements  would  inhibit  their  growth  as  they  were  more\nrelevant  to  commercial  banking.  Rather  than  amend  the  regulations,  the  Government\ndiscontinued BOM supervision of SCUs, which are now governed by the Cooperative Law of\nMongolia.  The  current  Cooperative  Law  primarily  addresses  agricultural,  manufacturing,\nconsumer,  and  marketing  cooperatives,  and  is  inadequate  to  deal  with  SCUs.  The  SCUs\nrecognize that this regulatory vacuum may undermine the future growth and sustainability of the\ncredit union system and are seeking to reintroduce a regulatory framework. A draft of prudential\nregulations and SCU by-laws prepared during the TA was presented to the Government to be\nused as an input in the preparation of SCU regulation and supervision policies. With the support\nof TA to BOM7 under ADB\u2019s Second Financial Sector Program loan (SFSPL),8 a draft NBFI law,\nthat is expected to include provisions for SCU regulation, is being prepared and is expected to\nbe approved in 2002.\nd.  Interest Rates\n25. At present, financial institutions enjoy high interest spreads on loans, reflecting the high\nlevel of perceived risk in the enterprise sector and high administration costs (up to 59 percent of\n                  \n6  Moncord was established as a SCU in 1996 and is widely regarded as one of the most mature credit unions in\nMongolia.\n7  TA 3459-MON: Strengthening Financial Sector Development, for $0.6 million, approved on 22 June 2000.\n8  Loan 1743-MON: Second Financial Sector Program, for $15 million equivalent, approved on 22 June 2000.", "77\ninterest revenue), rather than the level of annual inflation, which stands at 10 to 11 percent per\nyear. Additionally they reflect the lack of competition and inefficiencies in the banking system.\nSavings Bank reports time deposit interest rates of 1 percent per month and loan rates of 2 to\n3.2 percent per month. Mongol Post Bank has deposit rates of 10 to 12 percent per year\ncompared  with  lending  rates  of  26  to  36  percent  per  year.  The  SFSPL  is  supporting  the\nGovernment  in  developing  a  sound  framework  for  the  banking  system  including  the\nestablishment of enabling monetary policy that should help to reduce interest rate spreads in the\nbanking system. In the NBFI sector, annual rates of interest on loans range from 60 to 96\npercent, and in the informal sector, from 120 to 180 percent.\ne.  Demand for Financial Services in Rural Areas\n26. The nature of demand for financial services in rural areas is diverse, particularly among\nthe poor. Savings and credit are primarily needed for emergencies, consumption, investment in\nbusiness, household expenditure, education, and social and family obligations.\n27. In the rural financial services demand survey, 85 percent of respondents indicated a\nneed for credit, of which 75 percent specified a need for productive purposes, either to develop\nbusiness enterprises (38 percent) or to develop crop and livestock activities (37 percent). With\nrespect  to  loan  size,  61  percent  of  respondents  reported  a  need  for  loans  under  $1,000\nequivalent,  with  10  percent  specifying  loans  under  $90  equivalent.  A  further  29  percent\nindicated a requirement for loans between $1,000 to $5,000 equivalent. Respondents were\ngenerally aware of the need to pay interest rates for loans within the range of rates currently\navailable from various sources (SCUs, commercial banks, and NGOs), but below the highest\nrates in the market such as those of pawnbrokers, which are frequently 10 percent per month in\nrural areas. Half of all households surveyed said that they need loans with a maturity of 6 to 12\nmonths, and a further 30 percent reported demand for loans with a maturity under 6 months.\nThis reflects the need for short-term working capital loans to rehabilitate businesses starved of\ncash in recent years.\n28. Based on the survey, about 85 percent of all rural households require credit; at the\nestimated weighted average loan size of $865, the maximum level of demand equates to $280\nmillion.9 This probably overestimates actual demand given that once issues such as interest\nrates, loan maturities, and collateral are introduced into the borrower\u2019s decision-making process,\neffective  demand  will  be reduced. A more conservative estimate in the context of the Project\ncan  be  obtained  from  projected  SCU  membership  numbers.  Ten  percent  of  potential\nmembership among rural households are expected to actually join an SCU, equivalent to 22,100\nhouseholds, each with one household member joining a credit union. Based upon lending\nexperience in existing rural SCUs, loan sizes rarely exceed $1,000. Using only the percentage\nof the survey\u2019s respondents specifying loan demand below $1,000, a weighted average loan\nsize of $350 results. Also according to experience among existing SCUs, all members want to\nborrow. On this basis, total credit demand for SCU members equates to $13 million.\n29. In addition, evidence from the limited lending by other financial institutions in rural areas\nindicates a significant high level of demand. Since recommencing lending in November 2000,\nABM has disbursed over 1,000 loans for a total of $750,000 equivalent in only three months\noperating in aimag centers and 25 percent of soum centers. The terms and conditions of such\nloans with respect to size, purpose, and collateral requirements (para. 14) suggest that they are\n                  \n9  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  2000.  Human Development Report, Mongolia 2000, New  York,\nestimates 381,000 households in rural areas.", "88\ntargeted at small enterprises for investment or working capital needs. They therefore serve a\ndifferent market segment from the potentially large number of borrowers who are unable to offer\ncollateral, which includes the poor, or those who need to borrow for consumption, education,\nsocial, or other needs.\n30. While the survey found that 77 percent of all households consider borrowing to be the\nmost important financial service, especially for soum centers and rural households, the demand\nfor effective savings facilities is also significant. Among aimag center households, 27 percent of\nrespondents reported savings to be the most important financial service. The corresponding\nfigures for soum centers and rural households are 18 and 19 percent, respectively.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n31. In  1994  with  external  assistance,  the  Government  established  the  NPAP  to  tackle\npoverty by providing funds, including credit for employment generation, rehabilitation of social\ninfrastructure, support for poor households headed by women, and to strengthen the social\nsafety  net.  Other  central  and  regional  government  programs  have  been  established  for\nunemployment reduction, women\u2019s welfare, child development, and poverty reduction, the latter\nincluding a poverty reduction fund administered through local governor\u2019s offices. The success of\nthese programs has been limited. The NPAP, in particular, was not well-perceived by groups\nattending  rural  workshops  and  those  surveyed  during  the  TA  because  of  its  inequitable\ndistribution of funds and lack of transparency and accountability. During 1994-2000, NPAP was\nallocated $15.3 million from a variety of assistance agencies for the Employment Promotion\nFund ($4.4 million), Women\u2019s Development Fund ($1.4 million), Local Development Fund ($9.1\nmillion), and Social Assistance Fund ($0.4 million). At the end of 1998, only $6 million had been\ndisbursed and repayment results have been disappointing.\n32. In September 2000, the newly elected Government produced its own action program.\nSocial policy in the action program aims at improving living standards by providing equal access\nto social services, reducing unemployment, improving income distribution to narrow the income\ngap between social groups, and reducing the absolute level of poverty. This will be achieved by\nbroadening access to education and health services, and strengthening social insurance. In the\narea of rural finance and poverty, the Government\u2019s social policy measures include (i) promoting\nmicrofinance activities to provide incentives for enterprise development, and (ii) generating\nemployment  opportunities.  This  will  include  improving  access  to  skills  training,  particularly\nretraining  vulnerable  groups  to  enable  them  to  reenter  the  labor  market.  Economic  policy\nmeasures include (i) revitalizing banking and the financial sector by restructuring and privatizing\ncommercial banks; and (ii) improving the legal environment to support NBFIs activities, and\nincrease the responsibilities of lenders and borrowers. Regional and rural policy focuses on\nestablishing improved living conditions by improving services and infrastructure. This includes\nenhancing marketing networks and encouraging the establishment of cooperatives.\n33. Decentralization and emphasis on community participation in economic development are\nkey elements in the Government\u2019s strategy to reduce poverty. This is a feature of the Poverty\nPartnership  Agreement  signed  by  the  Government  and  ADB  on  24  March  2000,  which\nrecognizes that the poor in the different income groups will require different strategies: (i) for\npeople living above the poverty line but likely to become poor, small enterprise development,\nmicrofinance, skills development and labor advisory programs, and livestock and agriculture\nprograms;  (ii)  for  the  poor  living  below  but  close  to  the  poverty  line,  microfinance,  skills\ndevelopment and labor advisory programs, sustained access to social services, livestock and\nagriculture  programs,  and  development  of  social  infrastructure;  and  (iii)  for  the  very  poor,", "99\nincome generation activities, training and labor advisory programs, sustained access to social\nservices, and development of social infrastructure.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n34. Mongolia has received significant external assistance to develop its financial sector. The\nfocus of this assistance has been on introducing a market orientation and commercializing the\nbanking system, liberalizing banking policies, strengthening regulations, building capacity in\nbanking , and restoring health to viable banks.\n35. ADB has played an important role in the reform and development of the financial sector.\nADB has provided three loans of $53 million equivalent for the Financial Sector Program,10\nSecond Financial Sector Program (footnote 8), and Employment Generation Project (footnote\n4).  It also provided a TA loan of $3 million equivalent for improving banking skills,11 and 13 TA\ngrants totaling $5.4 million equivalent for the development of the bank and nonbank financial\nsubsectors.12 Other external assistance to the financial sector includes (i) International Monetary\nFund poverty reduction growth facility for SDR33 million approved in 1999; (ii) World Bank\nprivate sector development credit for $12 million equivalent channeled through commercial\nbanks  and,  together  with  ADB\u2019s  SFSPL  under  the  Financial  Sector  Reform  Program,  the\nFinancial  Sector  Adjustment  Credit  for  $32  million  equivalent;  (iii)  USAID  TA  for  bank\nrestructuring, financial audits, and privatization, and support for the pension system; (iv) GTZ TA\nsupport for restructuring  of  ABM alongside USAID; (v) Japan International Cooperation Agency\nTA support for strengthening commercial banks, the payments system, and rural credit; and (vi)\nTechnical Assistance for Commonwealth of Independent States support for the development of\nCredit Mongol, an NBFI.\n36. In 1999, to ensure effective aid coordination in the financial sector, the Government\nproposed to the funding bodies that they form a thematic group and prepare a financial sector\nstrategy with World Bank support. The financial sector strategy laid down the long-term vision\nand  medium-term  strategy  for  financial  sector  development  based  on  improving  financial\nintermediation processes, strengthening prudential regulations and supervisory framework for\nthe NBFI subsector, developing capital market infrastructure, developing the pension system,\nand strengthening the legal and regulatory reforms of the insurance system. Based on this\nstrategy, the Government has worked closely with ADB and the World Bank to formulate the\nFinancial Sector Reform Program, which covers the various subsectors of the financial sector\nfor potential parallel financing of the associated costs of structural adjustment.\n                  \n10 Loan 1509-MON: Financial Sector Program, for $35 million equivalent, approved on 19 December 1996.\n11 TA Loan 1510-MON: Upgrading Skills and Systems of Commercial Banks, for $3.0 million equivalent, approved on\n19 December 1996.\n12 TA 2720-MON: Strengthening the Supervisory and Restructuring Capacity of the Bank of Mongolia, for $1.0 million,\napproved on 19 December 1996; TA 2219-MON: Strengthening of the Commercial Banking System, for $0.6\nmillion, approved on 05 December 1994; TA 1643-MON: Institutional Support to the Mongol Bank, for $0.1 million,\napproved on 2 January 1992; TA 2605-MON: Development of Bank Restructuring Strategies, for $0.1 million,\napproved on 9 July 1996; TA 2697-MON: Implementation of Bank Restructuring Strategies, for $0.1 million,\napproved on 3 December 1996; TA 2105-MON: Institutional Strengthening of Agricultural Banking Services, for\n$0.3 million, approved on 20 June 1994; TA 3459-MON: Strengthening Financial Sector Development, for $0.6\nmillion, approved on 22 June 2000; TA 1855-MON: Institution Strengthening of the Financial Sector, for $0.6\nmillion, approved on 17 March 1993; TA 3406-MON: Housing Sector Finance, for $0.6 million, approved on 2\nMarch 2000; TA 3397-MON: Rural Finance, for $0.7 million, approved on 2 February 2000; TA 2797-MON:\nDevelopment of a Regulatory Framework for Nonbank Financial Institutions, for $0.1 million, approved on 20 May\n1997; TA 1538-MON: Adviser to Mongolian Stock Exchange, for $0.5 million, approved on 22 November 1993; and\nTA 1840-MON: Employment Generation, for $0.1 million, approved on 8 January 1993.", "1100\n37. ADB\u2019s support for other sectors also includes indirect support for rural finance. The\nAgriculture Sector Development Program13 investment loan includes a line of credit of $5.5\nmillion equivalent, through participating financial institutions, for rural agricultural enterprises.\nADB\u2019s Housing Finance (Sector) Project, scheduled for approval in 2001, will provide long-term\ncredit  for  housing  and  related  infrastructure  development  by  subborrowers.  ADB\u2019s  Social\nSecurity Sector Development Program14 includes support for the development of a social safety\nnet,  including  unemployment  insurance.  Support  from  other  external  agencies  in  the  rural\nfinance  sector  includes  the  NPAP  supported  by  the  World  Bank,  GTZ\u2019s  support  for  the\ndevelopment  of  multipurpose  cooperatives,  and  USAID\u2019s  Strengthening  Participation  and\nInstitutional Capacities in Enterprise and Market Development in Rural Areas, and the Gobi\nRegional Economic Growth Initiative.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n38. An ADB impact evaluation study15 reported four important lessons learned from the\nimplementation of rural credit projects. These are that rural credit projects should (i) give due\nemphasis  to  promoting  a  sound  and  sustainable  rural  finance  system  that  considers  both\nsavings and credit services; (ii) facilitate the mobilization of savings; (iii) encourage the use of\nmarket interest rates; and (iv) provide adequate capacity building support that is provided in a\nsustained manner over a period of time rather than in isolated inputs in order to maximize its\nimpact.\n39. In  Mongolia,  the  Employment  Generation  Project  (para.  21)  established  SCUs  and\ndemonstrated that the high demand for efficient microfinance services is not met by the formal\nfinancial sector. So far, however, SCUs have developed without adequate access to training on\nSCU principles and operational policies and procedures. As such, many lack the effective\nmanagement required to expand and achieve long-term sustainability.  To be able to provide\neffective financial services, they must receive continued assistance in the form of institutional\ntraining and capacity building. No effective regulatory and supervisory framework is currently\navailable to oversee their operations.\n40. The Kyrgyz Republic Rural Financial Institutions Project,16 which also focused on the\ncredit union movement, provides additional lessons. Unlike Mongolia, no credit union movement\nwas emerging in the Kyrgyz Republic when the project was designed and implementation\nstarted. As of March 2001, 206 licensed credit unions with 12,544 members (an average\nmembership of 60 per credit union) were operating. Average loan size was $230. The Kyrgyz\nexperience demonstrates that distrust among potential credit members and, as in Mongolia, low\npopulation density and wide geographic dispersion does not inhibit the development of the\ncredit union movement.\n41. ADB has considerable experience with the development of microfinance as a means to\nreduce  poverty.17  This  indicates  that  a  financial  systems  development  approach  is  key  to\nmaximizing development impact and achieving sustainable results. This approach focuses on\n                  \n13 Loan No. 1822-MON: Agriculture Sector Development Program, for $10 million equivalent, approved on 21\nDecember 2000.\n14 Loan 1836/1837: Social Security Sector Development Program, for $12.0 million equivalent, approved on 28\nAugust 2001.\n15 IES: REG 2001-04: Impact Evaluation Study of ADB\u2019s Rural Credit Assistance in Bangladesh, People\u2019s Republic of\nChina, Indonesia, Nepal, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, Asian Development Bank, January 2001.\n16 Loan 1529-KGZ: Rural Financial Institutions Project, for $12.5 million equivalent, approved on 21 August 1997.\n17 Meyer, Richard, and Geetha Nagarajan. 2000.

In this context,\nexperience indicates that clients are concerned more about having ready access to a variety of\nquality services rather than the cost of those services. To have a lasting impact upon poverty\nreduction, institutions must be committed to expanding outreach and sustainability to ensure\npermanent access to financial services for the rural population. Services must also be provided\non a fully commercial basis. Significant capacity building has been found to be necessary for\ninstitutions that target clients in resource-poor areas as is the case for large areas of rural\nMongolia.  In  addition  to  capacity  building  in  financial  institutions,  social  intermediation  to\nintroduce the poor to financial services, and in the case of Mongolia, the market economic\nsystem, is essential to facilitate their access to services.\n42. The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s microfinance development strategy18 as it focuses\non creating a policy environment conducive to developing financial infrastructure, building viable\ninstitutions, supporting pro-poor innovations, and supporting social preparation.\n43. Microfinance experience also indicates that the demand for savings services among\npoor households and microenterprises is as great, if not greater, than the demand for credit.\nMost  cash  in  rural  areas  is  kept  outside  financial  institutions,  and  safe,  reliable  savings\nopportunities  are  needed.  The  provision  of  secure  savings  facilities  contributes  to  poverty\nreduction not only through interest on deposits, but also by facilitating the development of\nsmoother consumption patterns and reducing the impact of economic shocks. Expansion of\nsavings services also offers real potential for the attainment of institutional sustainability. A\nsound legal and regulatory environment and prudential standards must be established early in\nthe development of financial systems to protect savings.\n44. Experience from countries such as Bangladesh,19 Indonesia,20 Kyrgyz (footnote 15),\nNepal,21  and  Philippines,22  also suggests that  apex  organizations  can  provide  an  effective\nmechanism for onlending external funds to rural financial institutions and subborrowers.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n1.  Country Operational Strategy\n45. In conjunction with the Government, ADB has developed a poverty reduction strategy for\n2000-2005 that forms the focus of ADB\u2019s country operational strategy. The key features of the\nstrategy are to (i) generate widespread employment within the short to medium term, (ii) focus\nemployment  generation  on  aimag  centers  where  the  poor  are  concentrated;  (iii)  promote\nemployment generation through the private sector, (iv) provide a strong social safety net for the\nvery poor who may be beyond the reach of self-help opportunities, and (v) safeguard delivery of\nsocial services to prevent the development of non-income-based forms of poverty. The strategy\nidentifies five core sectors of which the financial and agricultural sectors are fundamental to the\nreduction of income-based poverty.\n                  \n18 ADB. 2000.

Development of the financial sector will address the constraints posed by the weak\nbanking system, which is virtually nonexistent in rural areas; private sector investment and\nsavings  must  be  mobilized  and  alternative  sources  of  finance  developed,  in  particular\nmicrofinance initiatives. The cost of funds must not be subsidized, rather market interest rates\nshould be applied to support long-term sustainability of microfinance institutions. The agriculture\nsector, as traditionally the most important in terms of GDP and employment, offers the potential\nfor income and employment generation through the establishment or rehabilitation of production\nand processing enterprises. The importance of sectoral linkages in revitalizing the economy is\nemphasized in the country operational strategy. The linkage between the development of rural\nfinancial services and agricultural growth is particularly strong. In particular, finance will be\nrequired to realize the potential for developing agroprocessing enterprises that offer significant\nprospects for growth, particularly in view of the large livestock subsector. Agroprocessing too\nhas significant potential for employment creation and providing a year-round source of income\nwith positive implications for poverty reduction.\n47. The  strategy  aims  to  shift  the  focus  of  economic  growth  from  capital  intensive,\nnoninclusive public investments to more labor-intensive, inclusive private sector-led employment\ngeneration aimed at reducing poverty. The complementary development of human resources\nappropriate to market economic conditions will require training for professional cadres, as well\nas skills and business training to ensure a supply of appropriate skills to support growth. For this\npurpose, both public and private training institutions will need to be strengthened.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n48. Since Mongolia became a member of ADB in 1991, ADB has maintained a continuous\ndialogue with the Government on its general reform program for transition, focusing on the\nagricultural and financial sectors.\n49. ADB has strongly influenced the policy of the Government to consider mechanisms for\nmoving away from traditional approaches to rural finance. The traditional approach relied mainly\non supply-led, state-owned, agricultural credit institutions delivering directed subsidized credit.\nThe new more systematic and institutional approach promotes private institutions providing both\nsavings  and  lending  services  to  the  broader  rural  community,  not  just  to  agriculture.  The\nGovernment  is  pursuing  a  longer-term  strategy  to  develop  self-sustaining  rural  financial\ninstitutions. The steady growth and development of the SCU movement in Mongolia supports\nthe appropriateness of this approach.\n50. The Government recognizes that the legal and regulatory framework for SCUs needs to\nbe strengthened, either by amending the existing Cooperative Law or by passing the NBFI law.\nThe major issue concerning SCUs is their regulation and supervision to ensure healthy and\nsustainable SCU development under the overall supervision of BOM. While the final institutional\nstructure of regulation and supervision of SCUs remains an issue of parliamentary debate, the\nGovernment has agreed that, as an interim measure, the SCUs under the Project will be\nsupervised by a supervision development unit (SDU) to be within the project management unit\n(PMU)  under  the  Project.  The  supervisory  capacity  developed  during  the  Project  will  be\nincorporated into the institutional framework to be established through the envisaged legislation.\n51. ADB provided the Government with a draft of legislation and prudential regulations for\nSCUs prepared during the project preparatory TA. The Government continues to develop the\nlegislation and prudential regulations with the support of ADB technical support under the\nSFSPL.", "1133\n52. The interest structure will be formulated in line with competitive market principles to\nensure that the interest of different stakeholders including SCU members and participating\ncommercial banks (PCBs), and will enable SCUs to develop on a sustainable basis. No subsidy\nshould be provided through an administrated rate of interest for SCUs.\nIV.   THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n53. A sustainable rural financial system is a critical element of successful rural economies,\nand accessibility to rural financial services is a crucial factor among the poor, near poor, and\nvulnerable groups in improving their quality of life. The lack of access to either formal banking or\nNBFIs has been identified as a major impediment to improving their conditions and livelihood.\nThe survey conducted during the TA found that only about 3 percent of the respondents had\naccess to credit and 1 percent to deposit services. The constraints facing banking suggest that it\nwill not be in a position to satisfy demand for financial services in rural areas, particularly for\npoor or near poor individuals or small enterprises, in the foreseeable future. Despite ongoing\nexternal assistance to the rural banking system, two major problems remain. First, distrust\namong the rural population of the security of bank deposits is significant. Second, as the rural\nbanking system develops it will initially focus on larger loans requiring collateral. The transaction\ncosts  involved  in  meeting  the  demand  of  poor  borrowers  or  small  entrepreneurs  without\ncollateral  and  the  specialized  expertise  needed  to  assess  such  loans  preclude  any  early\nsignificant movement of the rural banks to meet this demand of the rural population, particularly\nthe poor, near-poor, and vulnerable groups. Given this failure by existing banking institutions to\nreach the rural population and the limited availability and high cost of credit through the informal\nsector, sustainable institutions need to be established to offer a range of financial services.\n54. The TA found that establishing a national network of SCUs and an appropriate legal and\nregulatory framework is a viable, sustainable alternative to the formal banking system in rural\nareas. Seventy-five percent of the respondents of the TA survey said they would like to join an\nSCU. SCUs generally have a strong local focus and have a positive effect upon community\ndevelopment and the growth of social capital. They offer a number of advantages: (i) SCUs are\nowned  by  the  members,  and  the  policymaking  leadership  is  drawn  from  the  members\nthemselves; (ii) local ownership reduces credit risk and provides peer pressure incentives to\nrepay loans; (iii) SCUs improve access to financial services for local people and can meet short-\nterm or emergency needs of the poor for health and education expenses; (iv) their proximity to\npotential clients can facilitate mobilization of small deposits; (v) SCUs can offer services with\nlow transaction costs, because of their proximity to, and familiarity with members, thus reducing\nthe debt burden on the poor who now use money lenders at exorbitant rates; (vi) their small size\npermits the adoption of simple procedures; and (vii) the link between savings and the ability to\naccess credit is much stronger than in commercial banks, particularly where lending is character\nor  cash-flow  based  rather  than  collateralized,  a  feature  of  SCU  lending  that  makes  them\nparticularly attractive to asset-poor households. By providing security for member shares, and\nsavings and interest rates that provide a real return on deposits, SCUs can mobilize savings\nthat are currently converted into nonmonetary assets. The development of SCUs within the\nProject  must be complemented by the support of apex organizations that will help to facilitate\nan organized delivery of financial services through legally licensed and regulated institutions in\nthe rural areas and stimulate development of the financial sector in the short and medium term.\n55. Establishing an SCU system accessible by the poor is not sufficient to ensure the poor\nwill gain access, or that the poor will have the necessary skills to use the credit effectively. In", "1144\nthis  regard,  poor,  vulnerable  groups,  and  small  entrepreneurs  lack  commercially  focused\nbusiness management skills and information regarding business opportunities, alternative credit\nsources,  employment  opportunities,  prices,  and  market  outlets.  They  need  market-related\ntraining including basic business identification, development, operation, and management. The\nprovision of such information is seen as an essential complementary service that must be\ndeveloped as part of the social preparation in rural areas. Skills training is also needed to\nenable the unemployed who do not possess entrepreneurial skills to acquire new skills that will\nbe  required  by  a  functioning  private  sector.  Social  constraints  include  lack  of  access  to\ninformation and training on a range of sociocultural issues including community awareness,\nhealth education (disease prevention, alcohol abuse, etc.), environmental protection, self-help\nschemes, NGO activities, and entertainment. The provision of such services will also lessen the\nrisk that the social dimension of poverty becomes more significant.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n56. The long-term objective of the Project is to develop a sustainable rural financial system\nthat  will  contribute  to  both  economic  growth  and  poverty  reduction.  The  Project  has  two\npurposes: (i) to increase the availability of and access to savings and credit services in rural\nareas and among the poor; and (ii) to provide a focal point for rural communities to access\ninformation and resources to support economic activities to be financed by SCUs, and satisfy\nsocially  related  information  and  training  needs.  The  Project  has  three  components:  (i)\ndevelopment of rural SCUs; (ii) establishment of information and resource centers (IRCs); and\n(iii) capacity building in project management. The Project will initially be implemented on a pilot\nbasis over three years in four aimags (Arhangay, Dundgovi, Dzavhan, and Sukhbaatar) and\nexpanded nationwide during the remaining four years of the Project.\n1.  Development of Rural Savings and Credit Unions\n57. An SCU system, comprising a credit union service organization (CUSO), a network of\nabout 330 individual member-owned SCUs, and an SDU, will be developed to mobilize savings\nand provide lending services to members at aimag and soum levels.\n58. The Project will support the development of an appropriate CUSO to (i) promote  SCU\nestablishment, (ii) develop and implement an effective program of training and technical skills\nfor SCU staff, (iii) select local training institutes and NGOs to deliver training to SCU board\nmembers and staff, (iv) monitor training effectiveness, and (v) facilitate the delivery of a project\ncredit  line  to  SCUs.  Based  on  an  assessment  of  the  three  existing  credit  union  apex\norganizations  (Appendix  4),  NetMon  was  selected  to  perform  the  functions  of  the  CUSO.\nNetMon was established with initial paid-in capital of MNT13.5 million ($13,500 equivalent) and\nlicensed as an NBFI by BOM in July 2000. It services 20 SCUs, and has successfully provided\nsmall loans and enforced prudential standards on borrowing SCUs.\n59. During the pilot phase, CUSO activities under the Project will be strictly limited to the\nfour pilot aimags. To ensure the CUSO does not overextend its services, project support will not\nbe available to nonpilot SCUs. However, it will continue to provide services to its existing\nnetwork of SCUs, but this will not be expanded during the pilot phase. The performance of\nNetMon as the CUSO will be monitored regularly during implementation; if its performance is\nnot satisfactory, an alternative CUSO will be selected/established.\n60. The  CUSO  will  service  the  SCUs  through  its  head  office  and  using  a  project\nimplementation office (PIO) as a venue in each aimag to carry out its functions. The Project will", "1155\nprovide computers with appropriate software, office equipment, and furniture for the head office\nand each PIO to facilitate the effective delivery of the CUSO\u2019s functions. A four-wheel drive\nvehicle will be provided to each PIO to undertake the promotional, training, and monitoring\nactivities at the soum level, but no vehicle will be provided to the head office.\n61. The Project will strengthen the CUSO capabilities for management support, staff training\nand  technical  skills  transfer,  design  and  implementation  of  financial  systems  including  an\nappropriate  management  information  system  (MIS),  and  development  of  SCU  lending  and\nsavings  policies  and  procedures.  In  addition,  training  materials  and  technical  tools  will  be\ndeveloped,  and  training  delivery  skills  of  all  personnel  from  the  CUSO  and  other  training\ninstitutes  involved  in  the  training  of  SCU  staff  will  be  developed.  The  curriculum  will  be\ncomplemented  by  the  training  material  developed,  tested,  and  delivered  under  TA  2105,\nInstitutional Strengthening of Agricultural Banking Services (footnote 12).\n62. A network of about 330 SCUs, comprising an estimated membership of 22,100 people,\nwill be developed. About 60 SCUs (12,000 members) will be established at the aimag level and\n270 SCUs (10,100 members) at the soum level. Each SCU will include a board of directors,\ncredit committee, and audit committee, and will provide savings and loan products to meet the\ndemand and needs of their members.\n63. The  SCUs  will  be  financed  by  a  combination  of  member  share  contributions,  and\nmember savings and borrowing.  To make membership as open and attractive as possible and\nto encourage participation by the poor, the minimum full member share contribution will be set\nat MNT5,000, equivalent to about $5.23 Members may be allowed to pay the minimum share\ncontribution in installments. The Project will provide a revolving line of credit totaling $4.9 million\nto match members\u2019 contributions to supplement the available resources for lending to members.\nThe types of lending activities will not be restricted.\n64. Appropriate regulations and effective supervision will be essential for the success of the\nSCU system. BOM is using the draft legal and regulatory framework prepared by the TA to\nfinalize a framework for the SCUs. The development of adequate supervision capability is\nimportant for the financial viability and long-term sustainability of the credit union movement.\nThe Project will support the establishment of a professionally staffed SDU within the PMU. At\nthe end of phase I, a decision will be made by the Government, BOM, and ADB on developing\nthe SDU to meet the significant, expanded capacity required to meet the nationwide expansion\nof SCUs in phase II. This will include a decision on realigning the SDU as an independent\nagency or placing it under the authority of another agency. Establishment of an SCU legal and\nregulatory framework acceptable to ADB is a condition for moving from phase I to phase II of\nthe Project.\n65. The SDU will (i) establish a system for regulation and supervision of the SCUs created\nunder the Project, (ii) conduct regular monitoring and on-site supervision and auditing of SCUs\nto assess compliance with prudential regulations, and (iii) propose corrective measures for\nadequate  compliance  with  regulations.  The  Project  will  provide  office  equipment,  including\ncomputers,  and  consulting  services  and  training  for  establishing  appropriate  systems  and\nprocedures for the effective supervision and regulation of the SCU system.\n                  \n23 This minimum share contribution is considered feasible on the basis of the size of contributions that soum\nhouseholds indicated in the survey they would be able to make to join an SCU.", "1166\n2.  Establishment of Information and Resource Centers\n66. The  Project  will  establish  four  IRCs,  one  in  each  of  the  pilot  aimags.  The  survey\nconducted during the TA indicated a significant demand for training, particularly among poor\nhouseholds. In certain areas, NGOs, already providing training to the poor, confirm the need for\nadditional training. A training and information needs assessment will be conducted in each\naimag to identify the specific needs at the community level and to review ongoing programs,\ntraining facilities, and delivery mechanisms. Based on the findings of this assessment, training\nprograms, information campaigns, and support services will be developed for each IRC (see\nAppendix 5). Local NGOs will have an important role to play in establishing and operating the\nIRCs. NGOs will be engaged to facilitate and/or deliver the various services. The Project will\nfinance the necessary refurbishment of existing facilities and provide equipment and training\nfunds in each pilot aimag that has the capacity to accommodate an administration office and\ntraining facility.\n67. The IRCs will play a key role in the social preparation and promotion of the SCU\nconcept. They will mobilize groups to establish SCUs, help with registration and licensing, and\nfacilitate the training of SCU staff. Particular attention in the promotional campaign and social\nmobilization process will be given to the poor. These groups will be given special attention to\nincrease their awareness of the savings and credit benefits to be provided by the SCUs, identify\nspecific  products  the  SCUs  can  develop  to  meet  their  needs,  and  develop  appropriate\nmembership arrangements (e.g., payment of membership fee by installment). The CUSO will\ncoordinate all activities with NGOs focusing primarily on the social mobilization process.\n68. The IRCs will provide an important mechanism for increasing SCU outreach in remote\nareas.  By  providing  information,  training,  and  effective  targeting,  the  IRCs  will  facilitate\nrecruitment of SCU members among the poor. The IRC office will be provided with computer\nequipment, office furniture and equipment, and training equipment. The Project will also finance\nthe initial purchase of books and publications. A four-wheel drive vehicle will be provided to\neach  IRC  to  enable  it  to  travel  to  soums  to  deliver  training  courses  and  workshops  and\ndisseminate information.\n3.  Capacity Building in Project Management\n69. The Project will establish a PMU under MOFE that will (i) oversee the CUSO operation;\n(ii) establish and manage a training fund to finance SCU training; (iii) authorize disbursement of\nfunds under the Project and authorize withdrawal applications; (iv) in conjunction with existing\ncredit union apex organizations and BOM, establish and monitor SDU operation; (v) establish\nthe IRCs and supervise their operation; (vi) develop training delivery capability among training\nstaff in project-related institutions; and (vii) conduct project monitoring and evaluation.\n70. The Project will finance the refurbishment of office space for the establishment of a PMU\noffice in Ulaanbaatar and one PIO in each of the pilot aimag centers. Offices will be provided\nwith computers, equipment, and furniture. PIOs will be established only as a venue for the\nCUSO and SDU to carry out their functions at the aimag level. The PMU will be staffed by a\nnational project director appointed and funded by the Government, and an accountant and an\nadministrative  assistant  appointed  by  MOFE.  The  appointment  of  the  project  director,\naccountant, and administrative assistant will be subject to ADB agreement.\n71. On successful completion of the pilot phase, the PMU in conjunction with the CUSO will\nundertake a series of two-day workshops in all of Mongolia\u2019s nonpilot aimag centers. At these", "1177\nworkshops the lessons learned from the pilot phase on SCU promotion and establishment, staff\ntraining,  membership  development,  financial  services,  operating  procedures,  and  SCU\nregulation and supervision will be presented. This will set the stage for phase II, the nationwide\nexpansion of the SCU system.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n72. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $15 million equivalent, including taxes and\nduties,  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  interest  during  implementation.  Of  this,  $3.2\nmillion (22 percent) equivalent will be in foreign exchange, and $11.8 million equivalent (78\npercent) in local currency. A summary of cost estimates is presented in Table 1 and detailed\ncost estimates are shown in Appendix 6.\nTable 1: Project Cost Estimates\n($ \u2018000)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of SDR6.854 million ($8.7 million equivalent) to\nfinance 58 percent of the total cost, of which $3.2 million equivalent will finance all of the foreign\nexchange costs and $5.5 million equivalent, 46 percent of the total local currency costs. The\nBorrower will be Mongolia. The financing will be from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The loan\nwill be for a period of 32 years, including a grace period of eight years. Interest will be charged\nat 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. This level\nof  local  currency  financing  is  considered  acceptable  under  ADB\u2019s  local  currency  financing", "1188\npolicy.24 Because of its low per capita income, Mongolia is classified as a least-developed\ncountry under the United Nations system, and such ADB member countries are given priority in\nADB\u2019s local currency financing policy. The Government will finance $0.7 million equivalent (5\npercent). The other major financier, the SCUs themselves, will contribute $4.9 million equivalent\n(32 percent) in the form of members\u2019 financial contributions to their SCUs. The CUSO will\nfinance 3 percent of the total cost and the NGOs 2 percent.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ \u2018000)\nForeign Local\nSource Exchange Currency Total Percent\nADB 3,242 5,444 8,686 58\nGovernment 0 715 715 5\nCUSO 0 384 384 3\nSCUs 0 4,866 4,866 32\nNGOs 0 349 349 2\nTotal 3,242 11,758 15,000 100\nADB = Asian Development Bank, CUSO = credit union service organization, NGO = nongovernment organization,\nSCU = savings and credit union.\nSource: Staff estimates.\n74. Additional cost estimates are presented in Appendix 6.\nE.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Organization\na.  Executing Agency and Project Management\n75. MOFE will be the Executing Agency for the Project. A PMU will be established within\nMOFE for overall project implementation. It will be headed by a project director, who together\nwith relevant staff have been appointed by MOFE to ADB\u2019s satisfaction. MOFE, through the\nPMU, will be responsible for administration and disbursement of the loan proceeds, recruitment\nof  consultants,  procurement  of  equipment,  maintenance  of  accounts,  and  preparation  of\nprogress and completion reports. A project coordination committee will be established before\nloan effectiveness comprising representatives of MOFE, BOM, Ministry of Food and Agriculture,\nADB Resident Mission, the international adviser to the CUSO, CUSO, existing credit union apex\norganizations, and on a rotating basis, two representatives from rural SCUs, to provide overall\npolicy guidance related to the Project. It will meet at least every six months and be chaired by\nthe  deputy  director  of  MOFE.  The  PMU  national  director  will  act  as  committee  secretary.\nAppendix 7 presents a project organization chart.\n                  \n24 R1-95: Review of Lending Foreign Exchange for Local Currency Expenditures on Projects, 3 January 1995.", "1199\nb.  Credit Union Service Organization\n76. After  phase  I,  from  the  fourth  year  of  the  Project,  the  CUSO  will  expand  project\noperations to the whole of Mongolia, at which time all SCUs will be eligible to access its\nservices, in particular the project line of credit.\n77. All  staff  with  a  training  function  must  be  conversant  with  appropriate  training  and\nworkshop delivery techniques in the context of SCU operations. The CUSO training will be\ncomprehensive and include training modules, technical skills transfer, technical tools, MIS, and\nreporting capability in all key stages and areas of rural SCU development and strengthening.\n78. The CUSO\u2019s SCU marketing and training staff at the head office, with the help of\nconsulting services, will develop a program of workshops to be run at aimag and soum centers\nby aimag PIO office staff. Workshops will promote the credit union concept and the benefits of\nSCU formation among aimag center and soum populations. Aimag office customer services and\ntraining officers at the PIO will follow-up the workshops with direct support to groups wishing to\nform SCUs. Support will include measures to expand membership to reach the minimum size\n(25 members) required for participation in the Project. The CUSO\u2019s aimag office staff at the PIO\nwill also provide support for SCU registration, advice on procedures for election of officers and\nstaff, and support for SCU formation by introducing bylaws, systems, and procedures. Aimag\nstaff will subsequently develop a program of training for board members and all staff of newly\nformed SCUs within their aimag. Using the curriculum developed at head office, training will be\ndelivered at aimag IRCs. All SCU officers are expected to work on a voluntary basis until the\nSCU can afford to pay staff.\n79. Fees for training provided by both the CUSO and accredited training personnel will be\nfinanced from a training fund that will be established and managed by the PMU. The training\nfund will be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan and will be used to cover training\ndelivery fees and the travel, accommodation, and subsistence costs of SCU trainees, and the\nreproduction of training materials. Payments from the fund will be authorized by the PMU. Once\nMOFE begins to relend the project credit line to PFIs, part of the interest charged to PFIs will be\nused to replenish the training fund and repay the initial disbursements made by MOFE. The\ncharge to be levied for promotion and training and the training fund disbursement terms and\nconditions will be negotiated and agreed between MOFE, the PMU, the CUSO, and the PFIs. All\ntraining provided to nonpilot aimag SCUs from year 4 under the Project will be based upon 50\npercent cost recovery from the SCU. Repeat training for pilot aimags will be charged at the full\ncost of training delivery. Training costs not covered in this way will be financed from the training\nfund.\n80. The CUSO aimag offices at the PIOs will coordinate with the IRCs on training for pilot\naimag SCU members in core subjects, such as business planning and management that will be\ndelivered through the IRCs. Using local expertise from within the business, agriculture, and\nhealth sectors or NGOs, the CUSO, and IRCs will also arrange skills training that will be\navailable to SCU members as well as the general public. All such training will carry a nominal\ncharge from the outset as a means of encouraging the principle of cost recovery for the IRCs.\n81. The  CUSO  will  also  facilitate  the  delivery  of  the  project  credit  line,  which  will  be\nimplemented by eligible PFIs. Initially, its role in the credit line will be to develop and review\nSCU loan applications. The CUSO\u2019s aimag offices at the PIOs will review and approve loan\napplications in accordance with guidelines that will be established by its head office, and will\nforward all applications to head office for final review. Successful applications will then be", "2200\nrecommended for financing to the PFIs, which will have final responsibility for lending decisions\nas they will take the credit risk. Guidelines for the allocation of SCU loan applications to the PFIs\nand onlending terms and conditions will be agreed to by the PFIs, the CUSO, the PMU, and\nADB. Allocation of SCU loan applications to PFIs will be based upon an SCU\u2019s preference,\nsubject to the PFIs\u2019 loan portfolio quality, with particular reference to collection performance on\nprevious loans to the SCUs from the project credit line. All loan information (applications,\ndisbursements, repayments, balances outstanding) and details of loan purposes reported by\nindividual SCU member borrowers will be recorded by the CUSO aimag offices at the PIOs\nwithin the MIS, and reported monthly to the PMU.\n82. The  CUSO  will  receive  fees  for  SCU  eligibility  analysis  and  loan  origination  and\nappraisal performed on behalf of the PFIs from the spread that the PFIs earn from onlending the\nproject credit line. In the initial years of the Project while the PFIs\u2019 loan portfolio with SCUs and,\ntherefore, interest earned will remain small, and will be insufficient to cover the CUSO operating\ncosts. The balance will be financed by a loan from project funds to the CUSO until fees from\ncredit analysis plus those from the provision of services to the SCUs are sufficient to cover\noperating costs.\n83. The credit analysis role of NetMon (as the CUSO) and the lending role of the PFIs are\nexpected to converge. If NetMon meets the eligibility requirements for a PFI, it may be accepted\nas a PFI. However, if it is accepted as a PFI, it will stop its function as a credit analyst. A new\ninstitution will be selected to play this role. Similarly, should the PFIs develop SCU credit\nanalysis proficiency, they may carry out their own credit analysis on SCU loan applications they\nreceive. Such a convergence under the Project will result in positive externalities of competition\nwithin, and deepen the capacity of the financial sector.\nc.  Participating Financial Institutions\n84. During the initial stage of the Project, eligible PFIs are expected to comprise only PCBs.\nThe involvement of PCBs at the outset will encourage financial discipline and ensure the long-\nterm sustainability of the Project. To date, PCBs are the only financial institutions that have\nsignificant experience with loan origination, processing, and recovery; however, this does not\ninclude lending to credit unions. Appendix 8 presents the proposed eligibility criteria for PFIs.\nThe criteria includes prudential norms issued by BOM (e.g., capital adequacy, liquidity, provision\nfor nonperforming loans, and lending concentration). No ADB loan proceeds will be disbursed to\na PFI until an independent auditor\u2019s opinion acceptable to ADB has been issued certifying that\nthe PFI is in compliance with these prudential norms.\n85. The  CUSO  will  advise  the  PCBs  on  SCU  eligibility  for  borrowing  and  will  make\nrecommendations on individual loan applications received from the SCUs. The PCBs will take\nthe credit risk and will therefore have the final lending authority. The level of such borrowing will\nbe determined through negotiation between PCBs, SCUs, and the CUSO on the basis of\ntransaction costs to lenders and the prudential financial structure of the SCUs. The desirability\nof accelerating start-up operations must be balanced against considerations of SCU safety and\nsoundness. At the start-up of an SCU, the loan size will be limited to a maximum equal to the\nSCUs\u2019 share capital. Subsequently, loan sizes will be limited to 10 percent of an SCU\u2019s assets\nsubject  to  a  maximum  equal  to  the  SCU\u2019s  institutional  capital  (the  undivided  and", "2211\nnondistributable reserves of the SCU). Those SCUs with a verified delinquency rate of less than\n5 percent will be eligible to apply for funds under the project credit line.25\n86. On approval of an SCU loan application by a PCB, the PCB will apply to the PMU for\nauthorization for the disbursement of funds from MOFE. MOFE will enter into a subsidiary loan\nagreement with each PFI for the purpose of disbursement and recovery of SCU loans and for\nrepayment of credit line funds. Loans to individual SCUs will be for up to five years, but initially\nlimited to one year, on terms and conditions to be agreed between the PFI and the SCU with\nguidance  and  approval  from  the  CUSO  and  PMU.  The  SCUs  will  be  free  to  determine\nsublending rates to members according to normal financial criteria.\n87. The SCUs will be required to maintain a bank account with the PFI from which it will\nborrow. The SCUs may also establish accounts in their nearest bank for operational purposes.\nCredit line funds will be disbursed from the PFIs to individual SCUs into local bank accounts\nthrough established transfer systems. In accordance with loan schedules, the PFI will withdraw\nfunds from the SCU account and transfer from this amount the repayment due to MOFE, which\nMOFE will maintain in a separate account. MOFE will use these funds for amortization of the\nloan to ADB. When sufficient funds exist, subsequent loan disbursements from MOFE to the\nPFIs will be made from this account. Incremental SCU funding requirements will be met from\nfurther disbursements from the credit line.\nd.  Savings and Credit Unions\n88. Individual SCUs will be established using model SCU bylaws and policies, standard\nSCU chart of accounts, and standard SCU financial statements, with guidance from the CUSO\nand PMU. The standard chart of accounts and financial statements will be consistent with\ngenerally accepted credit union accounting standards and practices. Each SCU will set up a\nboard  of  directors,  credit  and  audit  committees,  and  administrative  staff,  all  initially  on  a\nvoluntary  basis  from  among  its  membership.  All  such  SCU  officers  will  be  trained  by  the\nCUSO\u2019s aimag office staff at the PIO or accredited staff from local institutions. SCU officers will\nimplement  systems  and  procedures  with  the  CUSO  support  and  will  operate  within\ninternationally accepted prudential regulations, which will initially be agreed to by the CUSO, the\nPMU, BOM, and credit union apex organizations. These regulations will be consistent with the\nprovisions of the legislation currently being prepared under ADB\u2019s SFSPL or other relevant\nlegislation.\n89. The SCUs will provide a range of savings and credit services to members. They will\ndevelop lending and savings mobilization policies and products with the CUSO support, in\naccordance with ADB relending policies. Initially, loans to members will be for a maximum of\nthree times an individual member\u2019s share contribution and for a maximum period of six months.\nAs the SCUs develop their credit analysis skills and as members demonstrate a good credit\nhistory,  loans  may  be  granted  on  the  basis  of  members\u2019  household  cash  flow,  members\u2019\ndemonstrated capacity to repay, and risk assessment.\n90. The SCUs will bear the credit risk of lending to members. They will undertake all credit\nanalysis concerning individual member loans and will have the final authority for loan approval.\nThe SCUs will provide loans for both consumption and production purposes. They will also be\n                  \n25 Delinquency is defined as the total outstanding balance of loans for which at least one payment is 30 days past\ndue.", "2222\nfree to undertake character and cash flow-based lending to reduce transaction costs, but will be\nencouraged to seek collateral when indicated by prudential norms.\ne.  Information and Resource Centers\n91. An IRC will be established in each pilot aimag center. Prior to establishment, a training\nand information needs analysis will be undertaken in each aimag to determine the specific\nneeds of local communities. This will be undertaken by four teams of domestic consultants over\na two month period to cover all soums in each aimag. The results of this analysis will guide the\ndesign of training and information campaigns that will be run by each IRC.\n92. Each  IRC  will  be  managed  by  a  director,  supported  by  an  accountant  and  driver.\nWorking  with  local  NGOs,  the  director  will  review  the  needs  analysis,  and  develop  and\nimplement the recommended programs. These will consist of a series of training courses and\nworkshops to be run at aimag and soum centers for rural communities covering a range of\ntopical issues. Subject matter specialists for each course and workshop will be drawn from local\ncommunities (NGOs, local administrations, agriculture, health, education, finance, and industry\nsectors,  etc.)  as  required.  Alternatively,  required  expertise  will  be  drawn  from  neighboring\naimags or Ulaanbaatar. During the first three years of operation, the Project will cover all\ntraining costs. Thereafter, NGOs, Government, and local institutions will assume increasing\nresponsibility for the IRCs and will introduce a program of cost recovery. As the IRCs will make\ninformation available on employment opportunities, a close relationship with the Ministry of\nLabor will be established.\n93. Responsibility for and ownership of the IRCs will remain with the PMU until year 5.\nThereafter, the Government will be the owner of the IRCs. The IRCs will charge fees for\nservices such as business planning and training, and the provision of professional advice using\nsubcontracted local expertise. They will also be free to subcontract to local administrations for\nthe provision of public sector functions such as health and social education, training, and\nworkshops.\n94. At the end of phase I, the experiences will be consolidated into a practical set of\nguidelines on mobilizing the poor to participate in the SCUs and developing skills of the  poor\nand small entrepreneurs. During phase II, the lessons from the pilot test will be disseminated to\nNGOs, the other SCU apex organizations, and externally assisted programs in the expansion\naimags,  utilizing,  as  opposed  to  duplicating,  ongoing  initiatives  to  complement  SCU\ndevelopment.\n2.  Project Implementation Schedule\n95. The Project will be implemented over seven years. The first three years will comprise a\npilot phase for the establishment, training, and operation of SCUs in four aimags. Years 4 to 7\nwill be used to consolidate and expand the network nationwide.\n96. The  performance  during  the  pilot  phase  will  be  closely  monitored,  focusing  on  the\nestablishment  of  the  SCUs,  training  implementation,  membership  growth,  member  share\ncontributions and savings mobilization, lending policies and procedures, loan portfolio growth,\nand  impact  upon  poverty  through  outreach  of  membership  and  services  to  the  poor.  A\ncomprehensive midterm review will be undertaken at the end of the pilot phase. Lessons\nlearned from the pilot phase and annual review missions will be used to develop a program of", "2233\nexpansion to  promote and establish SCUs nationwide during the remaining four years of the\nProject. A detailed implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 9.\n3.  Relending, Onlending, and Sublending Terms and Conditions\n97.  MOFE will relend the proceeds of the project line of credit to the PFIs in local currency\nat a rate of interest that covers the cost of funds, administration costs, foreign exchange and\ninterest variation risks, an allowance for inflation, and a charge to finance a fund that will be\nestablished and managed by the PMU for SCU training. The level of the charge to be reserved\nfor the training fund will be agreed to by MOFE, the PMU, and the CUSO. Loans to the PFIs will\nbe for up to five years. The PFIs will onlend to individual SCUs for up to five years, but the initial\nloans will be limited to a maximum period of one year until the SCU has developed a credit\nhistory  and  acceptable  repayment  performance.  Subject  to  satisfactory  performance  and\nagreement  between  the  CUSO,  PFIs,  and  PMU,  loan  maturity  may  be  extended  to  meet\ndemand. Loans to SCUs will be at rates of interest that include an allowance for the cost of\nfunds, administration costs, loan loss provision, credit risk, and commercial margin. The flow of\nfunds is presented in Appendix 10.\n98. Part of the margin received by the PFIs will be paid to the CUSO to cover its costs of\nSCU loan origination and appraisal on behalf of the PFIs and, indirectly, the cost of SCU\npromotion, training, and service provision. The share to be paid to the CUSO will be determined\nthrough negotiation with each PFI. If NetMon is eligible (according to criteria acceptable to the\nPMU and BOM) to participate in onlending credit line funds to the SCUs on its own account,\nthen it would no longer receive a margin from other PFIs for loan origination and approval. The\nother PFIs will have to develop their own loan origination and appraisal capability.\n99. The SCUs will sublend to members initially for a maximum period of six months at a rate\nthat  includes  an  allowance  for  administration  costs,  loan  loss  provision,  credit  risk,  and\ncommercial margin. This rate will be determined by individual SCU credit committees at a level\nthat provides each SCU with a sufficient margin to cover operating costs and to develop its\ninstitutional capital. It will also help to instill financial discipline in the SCUs and borrowing\nmembers.\n100. Based on discussions with MOFE, administration costs would be about 1 percent and\ninflation allowance about 6-8 percent. Assuming an allowance of 2 percent for a training fund,\nan indicative relending rate from MOFE to the PFIs as of July 2001 would be 10 to 12 percent.\nDiscussions with the PFIs, NBFIs, and SCUs suggest onlending from the PFIs to the SCUs at\nabout 24 percent and sublending by the SCUs to members at about 36 percent.\n101. The CUSO (NetMon) will also borrow from project funds to cover its operating costs for\nthe first four years under a subsidiary loan agreement with MOFE. The interest rate will be 10\npercent, for 8 years, with a grace period of 5 years for payment of the principal. Thereafter, the\nCUSO will take full responsibility for financing its operating costs from fees for the provision of\nservices and, in the longer term, subject to its eligibility as a participating financial institution\n(PFI)  from  onlending  the  project  credit  line  to  the  SCUs.  Costs  for  SCU  supervision  and\nregulation will be borne by the Project. By the end of the Project, depending on the size of the\nSCU network, the Government will need to determine the need for and funding of supervision\nand regulation, which may be a combination of state budget and SCU contributions. The Project\nwill fully finance the operation of the IRCs for the first three years, but project financing will be\ngradually phased out, reducing to 75 percent in year 4, 50 percent in year 5, and 25 percent in\nyear 6.", "2244\n4.  Disbursement\n102. The Project will establish two imprest accounts at BOM in foreign currency. The first will\nbe used for the disbursement of loan funds for project implementation. The second account will\nbe established and used for the operation of the project credit line. Upon the request of the\nGovernment, ADB will deposit an initial amount of $0.5 million to the first imprest account. The\nsecond imprest account for the credit line will have an initial deposit of $0.25 million. Both\naccounts will be set up and operated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook\nand  specific  agreements  reached  between  the  Government  and  ADB  for  project\nimplementation.\n103. Eligible operating expenditures under the Project will be reimbursed or drawn from the\nimprest account against satisfactory statements of expenditure subject to a maximum for any\nsingle payment of $100,000. The withdrawal of funds from the credit line account will be in\naccordance with procedures to be agreed between ADB, MOFE, the PMU, the CUSO, and the\nPFIs. Requests for withdrawal of funds will be submitted jointly by the CUSO and a PFI to the\nPMU. The PMU will then authorize the request and submit an application to MOFE for the\ntransfer of funds from the imprest account to a project account to be established and maintained\nin  the  PFI.  MOFE  will  establish  and  maintain  a  special  account  (revolving  fund)  to  allow\nproceeds from PFI repayments to be used to support additional lending activities similar to\nthose under the Project. Operation of the special account will continue after project completion.\n5.  Procurement\n104. All procurement under the Project will be carried out by the PMU in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Each supply contract for vehicles and equipment (other than\nminor equipment or materials) estimated to cost the equivalent of $500,000 or less will be\nawarded through international shopping. Contracts for minor equipment or materials estimated\nto cost $100,000 equivalent or less may be procured through direct purchase procedures.\nAppendix 11 shows the indicative contract packages for goods and services. With respect to the\nprocurement of goods and services financed by subloans, requirements will include that the\nprocurement procedures are appropriate under the circumstances and that goods and services\nfinanced by the subloans are from ADB member countries and are purchased at reasonable\nprice.\n6.  Consulting Services\n105. The recruitment of consultants will be undertaken by the PMU in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for the\nselection and engagement of domestic consultants. A total of 37 person-months of international\nand 15 person-months of domestic consulting services will be provided under the Project. At the\nCUSO, 20 person-months of international consulting services will be provided for head office\nsupport and 12 person-months for support in the CUSO\u2019s aimag offices at the PIOs. One\ninternational and three domestic person-months of consulting services will be provided for the\ndevelopment of the CUSO\u2019s MIS. Training services will be provided by the CUSO staff or will be\nsubcontracted to local training institutes, NGOs, or consultants as required. Three international\nperson-months will support the development of the SDU. For the IRCs, eight domestic person-\nmonths  (two  per  pilot  aimag)  will  be  used  to  undertake  a  training  and  information  needs\nanalysis, and one international person-month to deliver a training skills delivery training course\nfor all training staff within project institutions. Four months of domestic consulting services will\nbe provided to the PMU to develop the environmental awareness training module to be included", "2255\nin  the  CUSO  and  SCU  training  curriculum,  and  to  conduct  monitoring  of  potentially\nenvironmentally sensitive subprojects throughout the life of the Project.\n106. Consultants, to be provided through a firm, will be selected and engaged by MOFE in\nconsultation with the PMU in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\nConsultants  will  be  recruited  under  one  package.  Terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are\npresented in Appendix 12. Advance action for the selection of consultants will be taken in\naccordance with ADB procedures.\n7.  Accounts, Audit, and Reports\n107. MOFE  will  maintain  records  and  accounts  in  accordance  with  sound  accounting\nprinciples with sufficient detail to identify all goods and services financed by the Project and to\nindicate the use to which they were put under the Project. These principles are specified in the\nProject  Accounting  Manual  prepared  for  this  purpose  for  all  ADB  projects  in  Mongolia.26\nSeparate records will be maintained for each imprest account. The accounts (including financial\nstatements, statements of expenditure, and imprest accounts records) will be audited annually\naccording to sound auditing principles by independent external auditors acceptable to ADB.\nSeparate  records  will  be  maintained  for  each  imprest  account.  Costs  for  annual  audits\nthroughout Project implementation have been included within the project costs. MOFE will\nsubmit certified copies of the audited accounts and the auditor\u2019s report to ADB within nine\nmonths of the completion of each fiscal year.\n108. Under subsidiary loan agreements between MOFE and the CUSO, and MOFE and the\nPFIs, the CUSO and each PFI will be required to make audited financial statements available\nand to maintain all records relating to loans to individual SCUs for a period of five years from the\ndate the loan is agreed. The PMU and ADB may review these loan agreements and records on\na random basis. In addition, the CUSO will be required to make available to ADB a statement\nshowing  the  sources  and  uses  of  funds  related  specifically  to  project  implementation  and\nseparate from any other operations it may perform.\n109. MOFE through the PMU will be responsible for providing all reports agreed necessary\nfor ADB to ensure compliance with the terms of project implementation. MOFE will provide\nquarterly reports on project implementation and management, and issues arising that may\ninfluence future implementation. At the end of the pilot phase, MOFE will submit a midterm\nreport to be submitted no later than 30 days from the end of the quarter to which they relate.\nWithin three months of project completion, MOFE will submit a project completion report to\nADB. All reports will be in a format to be agreed with ADB and be presented in English. MOFE\nwill  also  provide  ADB  with  any  reasonable  additional  information  concerning  project\nimplementation that ADB may request from time to time.\n8.  Project Performance Monitoring\n110. A project monitoring and evaluation system acceptable to ADB will be established by\nMOFE that will allow comprehensive reporting of project input and output data. In addition to\nfinancial  data,  these  will  include  data  on  physical  inputs  related  to  equipment,  consulting\nservices, and promotional and training activities undertaken by the Project. Output data will\ninclude  number  of  credit  unions  established,  number  of  members  differentiated  by\nsocioeconomic  group,  share  contributions  and  savings  generated,  loans  disbursed,  SCU\n                  \n26 TA 2993-MON: Capacity Building in Project Accounting in Mongolia, for $150,000, approved on 10 March 1998.", "2266\ntraining  course  participants,  IRC  promotional  and  information  campaigns  mounted  and\nbeneficiaries reached, IRC training workshop participants, and other relevant data that will\nfacilitate monitoring and evaluation of the direct socioeconomic impact of the Project. In the\ncontext of the services provided by the SCUs to members, project monitoring and evaluation will\ninclude an assessment of the impact of access to savings and credit upon the livelihoods of\nbeneficiaries, specifically the degree to which the poor in rural areas benefit. This will include an\nanalysis of savings and credit growth, terms and conditions, the purposes to which they have\nbeen put, and their impact on household incomes.\n111. At the start of the Project, necessary baseline data and a set of indicators will be\nestablished by the PMU in collaboration with MOFE, the CUSO, the PFIs, the IRCs, and\nrelevant NGOs. Indicators such as percentage of short-, medium-, and long-term loans and\nrespective sizes will be included in the monitoring. A sample of households in the aimag center\nand selected soums within each pilot aimag will be established to serve as case studies to\nmonitor  the  socioeconomic  impact  of  SCU  membership  over  the  Project\u2019s  life.  Annual\nmonitoring and evaluation reports will be provided by the CUSO and IRCs to the PMU, which\nwill consolidate reports before presentation to ADB in a single annual report.\n112. ADB will undertake annual reviews of project implementation, and in cooperation with\nthe Government, will recommend remedial measures where appropriate. ADB will conduct a\nmidterm review at the end of the pilot phase to monitor the performance of the pilot phase in the\nestablishment  of  SCUs,  training  implementation,  membership  growth,  member  share\ncontributions and savings mobilization, lending policies and procedures, loan portfolio growth,\nand impact upon poverty. Lessons learned from the pilot phase and the midterm review will be\nincorporated into an expansion program to promote and establish SCUs nationwide during the\nremaining four years of the Project.\n9.  Anticorruption\n113. During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to Government\nofficials. Attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors to\nobserve high standards of ethics in procuring and executing ADB-financed contracts, and the\nsanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. Similarly, the anticorruption provisions added\nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants were discussed.\nF.  Environmental and Social Analysis\n1.  Environmental Analysis\n114. The Project is classified as environment category B. Beside loans for nonproduction\npurposes, the SCUs will likely finance small-scale subprojects such as flour mills, bakeries,\ncatering outlets, food shops, kiosks, woodworking, sewing and tailoring, crop and vegetable\nproduction, and livestock husbandry. Most subloans are expected to range from $50 to $1,000\nequivalent for working capital to expand and/or revitalize existing cash-starved small-scale rural\nenterprises. In view of this, the Project is not expected to cause any significant environmental\nconcerns.\n115. Due consideration of environmental issues will be given in the process of selecting and\nimplementing subprojects. Any microenterprise with potential adverse environmental impact, will\nbe  required  to  obtain  a  clearance  from  a  competent  environment  agency.  An  initial", "2277\nenvironmental examination for such a subproject will be carried out as part of the appraisal\nprocess and an appropriate report submitted to ADB for review. MOFE has given assurance\nthat the PFIs, the CUSO, and all participating SCUs and their subborrowers will comply with the\nenvironmental  laws  and  regulations  of  Mongolia,  particularly  the  Mongolian  Law  on\nEnvironmental Protection (1995), as well as ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines.\n116. To  minimize  the  risk  of  any  adverse  environmental  impacts  that  may  result  from\nsubprojects and to promote the importance of environmental issues in small-scale businesses, a\ntraining module on environmental awareness and requirements will be prepared and used to\ntrain  staff  involved  in  subloan  evaluation  and  subborrowers  involved  in  implementation  of\nsubprojects. The module will be developed by local experts or a reputable local environmental\nconsulting firm and will form part of the overall SCU training program.\n117. One month of domestic consulting services will be used to establish the training module\non environmental awareness. In addition, two weeks of domestic consulting services per year\nhas  been  allocated  for  the  PMU  to  undertake  environmental  monitoring  of  SCU  member\nsubprojects on a random sampling basis and lessons learned will be fed back into the training\nprocess.\n2.  Social Analysis\n118. Growth in income-based poverty since 1990 reflects an increase in inequality in income\ndistribution and a decline in key social indicators. Between 1990 and 1995, income and school\nenrollment declined steeply; life expectancy also decreased. After 1996, a series of Government\npolicy interventions resulted in some recovery. Key health concerns include continuing high\nmortality,  high  incidence  of  diseases  such  as  tuberculosis,  hepatitis,  sexually  transmitted\ndiseases, along with declines in nutritional status. The national incidence of poverty is estimated\nat 36 percent; rural poverty about 33 percent.27 In the pilot aimags, according to the official\npoverty line,28 40 percent of the population in Arhangay, 43 percent in Dundgovi, 23 percent in\nSukhbaatar,29 and 43 percent in Dzavhan live below the poverty line.\n119. Unemployment rates remain very high. The official rate of unemployment is 6.5 percent30\nequivalent to 39,000 people, but actual levels are undeniably higher. Actual unemployment\n(after adjusting for persons employed outside the formal sector) is estimated to range from 17 to\n23 percent of the working age population.\n120. Available data on existing SCUs indicate that while most members (about 75 percent)\nare middle-income earners, about a quarter of the members are poor. The latter are as keen as\nmiddle-income  earners  to  avail  of  financial  services  and  their  membership  is  expected  to\nincrease significantly if two constraints are addressed\u2014affordable membership fees, and SCU\ncompetitiveness in meeting the credit needs of the poor. The Project addresses these two\nfactors by setting the membership fee low ($5) and by targeting the poor in its outreach and\ntraining activities. The latter will include developing client-specific financial services to tailor the\n                  \n27 Based on the findings of the Living Standards Measurement Survey carried out by the World Bank in 1998.\n28 See footnote 3.\n29 Data for 1998. However, Sukhbaatar has been severely affected by the dzuds of 2000 and 2001, and as a\nconsequence, the percentage of the poor is estimated to have greatly increased to above 40 percent.\n30 The official definition considers the unemployed to be the number of persons who have registered with the Ministry\nof Labor as unemployed. This excludes first time labor market entrants ineligible for labor registry services and\nthose who see no value in registering. Hidden unemployment is estimated at 12 percent (ADB. 2000. Mongolia, A\nPoverty Reduction Strategy for ADB Operations in Mongolia. Manila).", "2288\nfeatures of the SCUs in poor communities to the needs of their members. This is done through\n(i) an affordable membership fee and possibly payment of this fee in installments, (ii) the IRCs\u2019\ntraining activities specifically targeting 50 percent of the poor to nurture their participation in the\nSCUs, and (iii) the SCUs developing financial products tailored to the needs of the poor. In that\nregard, given the incidence of poverty in the four pilot aimags is at or below the national poverty\nincidence of 36 percent, the membership of SCUs to be formed in these aimags will likewise be\nabout or above that percentage.\n121. About 54 percent of the unemployed are women. Women tend to have less job security\nthan men, less access to information, and less access to credit from the formal banking system.\nThe SCUs will provide women with access to savings and credit services, and their response to\nthe availability of services is likely to be positive. About 73 percent of the existing SCUs have\nbeen organized by women and their participation in the total membership is 60 to 70 percent.\nAbout 60 percent of managerial positions are occupied by women. Similar strong participation of\nwomen in SCUs can be found in the Kyrgyz Republic. In June 2000, participation of women in\ntotal membership was about 52 percent, and women occupied 40 percent of all managerial\npositions.31\n122. The performance and the repayment rates of SCUs are impressive. Existing SCUs have\na repayment rate of nearly 100 percent. The reason for the high repayment rate is the close\nmonitoring of SCU activities by membership, as the work of SCUs is based on transparent and\ndemocratic principles, including active involvement of members.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial Analysis\n1.  Financial Viability of the CUSO\n123. For the financial analysis, the CUSO is assumed to only earn income from providing\ncredit advisory services to the PFIs. The onlending margin that PFIs will earn is assumed to be\n14 percent from lending to the SCUs at 24 percent with a cost of funds of 10 to 12 percent. The\nanalysis was performed for a five-year period.\n124. The CUSO\u2019s income would be small during the first three years of the Project when the\nvolume of onlending is low due to the small number of credit unions in pilot aimags that would\nbe eligible to access the credit line during the pilot phase. Using a rate of 7 percent for the\nCUSO\u2019s fee income and an estimated average portfolio outstanding of $533,000, the CUSO\u2019s\nrevenues reach $37,300 by year 3. As the Project expands to the whole country, and all\nfinancially sound SCUs are eligible to borrow under the credit line, the volume of lending\nincreases significantly. In year 4, the average portfolio outstanding is estimated at $1.54 million\nand the CUSO revenue reaches $108,000. Annual costs in year 4 are $177,000 resulting from\nsteadily  increasing  costs  of  financing  the  borrowing  from  MOFE.  In  year  5,  the  CUSO  is\nestimated to return a profit of $18,000 based upon a revenue of $196,000 earned on the\naverage portfolio outstanding of $2.8 million. As the size of the portfolio increases, the CUSO\u2019s\nfinancial viability is improved. By the end of the Project, revenues are estimated to reach\n$289,000 on an average portfolio of $4.4 million.\n                  \n31 ADB. 2000. Women\u2019s Participation in Credit Unions in the Kyrgyz Republic. Report prepared for ADB\u2019s Rural\nFinancial Institution Project. Manila.", "2299\n125. However, as implementation proceeds, the CUSO will earn an increasing share of the\nonlending margin that will increase profitability, enabling it to breakeven and start to repay\nMOFE loans for operational expenses earlier. Projected financial statements for the CUSO\u2019s\noperations under the Project are presented in Appendix 13.\n2.  Financial Viability of Individual SCUs\n126. Financial analysis has been undertaken on illustrative examples of SCUs that would\nbenefit from participation in the Project. These are pilot aimag and soum SCUs, and nonpilot\naimag and soum SCUs. The assumptions underlying the analysis and financial statements for\nthe four examples are presented in Appendix 13.\n127. Growth rates are similar for both pilot and non-pilot aimag center SCUs. In value terms,\npilot aimag center SCUs achieve more than three times the assets of nonpilot aimag center\nSCUs. At the end of five years, nonpilot aimag center SCUs have assets of $69,000 and\nearnings of $3,600 compared with assets of $212,000 and earnings of $10,000 for pilot aimag\ncenter SCUs. The disparity in asset growth and income between soum level pilot and nonpilot\nSCUs is similar to that between aimag center pilot and nonpilot SCUs in the first three years.\nThe disparity levels out in years 4 and 5 because the pilot SCUs reach close to maximum\npenetration of potential membership in the first three years and have nominal membership\ngrowth thereafter.\n3.  Financial Analysis of Illustrative Subprojects\n128. In the subproject analyses, loan sizes range from the equivalent of about $40 for a small\nroadside guanz (cafeteria) to $1,000 for an investment loan to establish an ice cream production\nunit. Loan terms range from 3 to 10 months at an assumed interest rate of 2.75 percent per\nmonth. In addition to providing employment to the borrower, who will generally be the owner and\noperator of the enterprise, a number of the enterprises reviewed also will create employment for\nboth skilled and unskilled labor from within their community.\n129. Using  the  data  provided  on  subproject  inputs,  outputs,  and  prices,  each  has  been\nanalyzed  and  found  to  be  financially  viable  and  result  in  increases  in  monthly  household\nincomes, and generate sufficient cash flow to cover debt service. The subprojects have been\nsubjected to sensitivity analysis and generally found to be robust with regard to increases in\ncosts and reductions in revenue. Summary results are presented in Table 3.32\nTable 3: Summary Financial Indicators for Illustrative Subprojects\nAnnual Net Profit\nLoan Amount after Debt Service Person-Days of FIRR\nSubproject ($) ($) Labor per Yeara (%)b\nAgricultural Trading 1,125 582 90 \u2014\nRoadside Guanz 40 158 150 \u2014\nIce Cream Production 920 2,245 1,500  20\nFlour Milling 965 129 180 >100\nTailoring 490 1,570 1,080 \u2014\n\u2014 = indicates that an FIRR for a subproject cannot be calculated, FIRR = financial internal rate of return.\na Indicates the number of days of labor created by the subproject both within and outside the household operating the subproject.\nb Financial internal rate of return over the first 12 months of operation, excluding subloan financing flows.\n                  \n32 Detailed  analysis  and  supporting  projected  financial  statements  of  the  five  subprojects  are  available  in\nSupplementary Appendix E.", "3300\n130. Loans for education, medical expenses, weddings, etc. will also form part of an SCU\u2019s\nportfolio, but no attempt has been made to assess the debt service capacity of SCU members\nborrowing for such purposes or the \u201cviability\u201d of such borrowing.\nB.  Social Dimensions\n1. Growth of SCUs and Membership\n131. By the end of the pilot phase, 16 aimag center SCUs and 79 soum level SCUs are\nexpected to be established. By the end of the Project, total membership is estimated to reach\n22,100, of which 12,000 will be in 60 aimag center SCUs (with an average membership of 200),\nand 10,100 will be in 270 soum level SCUs (with an average membership of 37). The total\nmembership represents 6 percent of all rural households assuming one member per household.\nOn the basis of an average household size of 4.5 persons, the total number of individuals\nbenefiting from SCU membership is estimated to be about 100,000.\n132. Through the provision of business and skills training to SCU members, and through the\nIRCs, the provision of a wide range of training and information services to the general public,\nthe Project will contribute to the revitalization of rural areas, and therefore an improvement of\nrural livelihoods. The development of SCUs with low minimum share criteria for membership\n($5) will facilitate access to financial services to the rural community irrespective of income or\ndegree of poverty. Similarly, through the IRCs, the provision of training and information related\nto employment opportunities, health, social, and cultural issues will benefit rural communities\nand facilitate opportunities for the rural population to improve their livelihood. An estimated\n29,000 people will have attended training courses and/or one-day workshops. Through the\ntraining of members of the board credit committee, audit committee, and administrative staff, the\nProject will enhance the financial and managerial skills in rural areas within the SCU movement.\nIn addition, employment creation will be significant both within SCUs themselves when they\nreach a stage of development that requires full time staff, and within new and/or expanded\nenterprises that result from members\u2019 borrowing from the SCUs.\n2. Impact on Poverty\n133. Provision of savings facilities will support capital accumulation by the poor, enhancing\ntheir ability to manage risks and to take advantage of economic opportunities. The Project\nprovides enhanced access to savings and credit services, which has been identified as a\nprimary constraint to rural development and poverty reduction. The provision of such services\nthrough  locally  organized  and  managed  SCUs  offers  considerable  benefits  compared  with\nformal financial institutions such as commercial banks, which are currently unable to provide\nthese services to rural communities. The significantly lower administrative and transactions\ncosts of SCUs coupled with a lower level of risk due to peer pressure among members enables\nSCUs  to  offer  more  competitive  and  reasonable  interest  rates  on  borrowing  than  their\ncompetitors. In terms of economic impact, this ability to offer lower interest rates on loans will\nhave the greatest impact at the local level. Lower costs also translate into the ability of SCUs to\noffer attractive real rates of return on savings deposits. At present, the SCUs offer interest on\ndeposits in the range of 2 to 3 percent per month compared with informal sources. Initially, this\nwill be the most important benefit that will accrue to the poor who participate in the SCUs and\naccess savings facilities for which demand is strong but which are currently lacking in rural\nareas. The proposed system of associate SCU membership in which members can contribute to\nshare capital in installments in order to build up to the minimum level of contribution of $5\nequivalent will also facilitate access to membership for the poor.", "3311\n134. Because  of  the  distribution  of  population  in  rural  areas,  SCUs  with  the  largest\nmemberships will be established at aimag centers. The provision of financial services at aimag\ncenters accords with the strategy of the Poverty Partnership Agreement for Mongolia, which\nidentifies aimag centers as the areas where income and employment generation activities need\nto focus, since the poor are concentrated in aimag centers.  In addition to the impact that the\ndevelopment of SCUs will have on the provision of financial services, the IRCs will perform an\nimportant complementary social function providing opportunities for training and information\ndissemination.\n3. Impact on Employment\n135. The survey indicated that 75 percent of potential SCU members would probably borrow\nfor productive purposes, 38 percent for business enterprises, and 37 percent for agricultural\nproduction. The nature of business enterprises currently being financed by SCUs, XAC, Goviin\nEkhel, and ABM in rural areas include trading, retailing, agroprocessing, woodworking, catering,\nand tailoring. By the end of the Project, SCU membership is expected to reach around 22,100.\nSCU experience indicates that all members will borrow at some time. Assuming that 75 percent\nof members will borrow to establish or rehabilitate enterprises, it is estimated that employment\nwill be created for some 16,500 people assuming that most enterprises will be owner operated.\nSome of this employment will be part-time, or in the case of agriculture, seasonal. Equally, more\nsuccessful  enterprises  will  generate  additional  employment  opportunities  both  within  a\nborrower\u2019s household and outside in the community at large.\nC.  Risks\n136. The principal risks associated with the Project relate to the maintenance of a stable\nmacroeconomic environment on the part of the Government and the implementation of its\ndeclared policy on the development of rural areas, nonbank financial institutions, and poverty\nreduction during and beyond project implementation.\n137. Within the financial sector, rural financial markets must remain competitive and free from\nnonmarket interference, and the newly established SCUs must be free under Mongolian law to\noffer a range of financial services, including deposit mobilization. In this respect, to protect the\npublic interest and to avoid the negative perception with which the public views the formal\nfinancial sector, legislation governing the supervision and regulation of SCUs must be effectively\nimplemented. Failure to effectively control the current rapid and unsupervised growth of SCUs\nmay undermine the systematic promotion and development of SCUs under the Project. ADB is\nassisting the Government to address this concern through the SFSPL, and the Project will\nsupport this effort by providing SCU supervision and regulation capability in the SDU.\n138. While the rural population, especially the poor, can be expected to realize substantial\nbenefits from the Project, they may adopt a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d attitude to participating in the SCUs,\nas these institutions are relatively new for them. The risk will be addressed through extensive\npromotion and training efforts within these groups. Application of prudential regulations and\nstrict supervision will hopefully decrease the rural populations perceived risk of the SCUs.\n139. The Project places great importance on the need to (i) properly promote the SCU\nconcept throughout Mongolia through nationwide workshops, and (ii) implement effective SCUs\nat the aimag and soum levels. Considerable capacity building through consulting services will\nbe directed toward the CUSO and SCU development in the pilot aimags of the Project. The\nsuccess of the training effort will depend both upon the degree to which training is effective and", "3322\nupon persons trained remaining in their jobs to perform the functions for which they have been\ntrained. This applies to all the institutions established or supported under the Project, CUSO,\nSDU, SCU management, and SCU members themselves.\n140. Financial risks to the SCUs and their members may arise if membership is concentrated\nin groups who derive their income from a single economic sector. Economic shocks or collapse\nwithin that sector could have adverse impacts upon the viability of individual members and the\nSCU as a whole. Effective promotion and training will emphasize awareness of the risks of such\nmembership concentration and the benefits of diversity of members\u2019 sources of income.\n141. On the economic front, the success of the Project will depend upon a strong demand\nwithin the rural population for SCU services, in particular that credit demand is sufficient for the\nSCUs to draw down the project line of credit. All the evidence indicates that this will not be a\nmajor risk.\n142. The success of the IRC component will depend upon a strong demand within the rural\npopulation of the pilot aimags for training and information provided by the IRCs. The complete\nlack  of  such  facilities  since  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  system  together  with  the  demand\nexpressed during rapid rural appraisals suggest that adequate demand will continue. However,\nthe ability of rural communities to pay for such services as project financing is phased out will to\nsome degree depend upon the success of the Project in revitalizing the rural economy by\nproviding SCU financial services and the ability of the IRCs to provide services of a variety and\nquality that people will be prepared to pay for.\n143. While the Project will address the constraints posed by the present lack of financial\nservices and the need for training and information services in rural areas and by so doing help\nto reduce poverty levels, the Project will not be able to assist certain sections of the rural\npopulation through the provision of commercially viable and sustainable financial intermediation.\n144. Finally, the success of the Project will also, to a large degree, depend upon effective\nimplementation by the PMU and monitoring by ADB to identify potential problems and initiate\nremedial measures at an early stage. For this purpose, an effective national project director will\nbe essential as well as non-interference in the appointment of PMU staff.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n145. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  To be eligible to receive subloans under the credit line, each SCU will have to\nsatisfy  specific  criteria,  including  the  following:  each  SCU  will  have  been\nestablished in accordance with the model SCU bylaws, policies, standard SCU\nchart of accounts, and standard SCU financial statements developed under the\nProject; all SCU officers will have been trained by the CUSO aimag office staff at\nthe PIO or accredited staff from local institutions; and SCU officers will implement\nsystems  and  procedures  with  support  from  the  CUSO,  and  will  operate  in\naccordance with internationally accepted prudential regulations, to be agreed to\nby the CUSO, the PMU, BOM, and the credit union apex organizations.", "3333\n(ii)  Under the Project\u2019s credit line, the SCUs will borrow funds in accordance with the\nrequirements agreed to by the Government and ADB, including membership\nshare  contribution  and  compliance  with  relevant  environmental  laws  and\nregulations and ADB\u2019s environmental guidelines.\n(iii)  NetMon will be designated as the CUSO with overall responsibility for the SCU\npromotion and training.\n(iv)  The PFIs will be in compliance with the initial and ongoing eligibility criteria\nagreed to by the Government and ADB, including the prudential norms issued by\nBOM (e.g., capital adequacy, liquidity, provisioning for nonperforming loans, and\nlending concentration).  No ADB loan proceeds will be relent to a PFI under the\nProject\u2019s credit line until an independent auditor\u2019s opinion acceptable to ADB has\nbeen issued, certifying that the PFI is in compliance with these prudential norms.\n(v)  Based on the training assessment, training programs and information campaigns\nwill be developed at each IRC. At least 50 percent of the persons receiving\ntraining will be poor. The programs will concentrate on a broad spectrum of\ntraining  and  information  related  to  improving  livelihood  strategies  of  poor\nhouseholds, including skills training, health and nutrition, social services, market\nopportunities, and agricultural issues.\n(vi)  The PMU will establish the SCU training fund which will be funded under the\nProject and replenished with a portion of the interest payments received from the\nPFIs and from training fees collected during phase II of the Project.\n(vii)  The Government will take necessary actions to encourage the participation of\nwomen in SCU development, including SCU establishment and management.\n(viii)  MOFE will ensure that real positive interest rates are charged by the PFIs and\nSCUs  with  sufficient  margin  to  cover  the  cost  of  funds,  credit  risk,  and\nadministration costs, including appropriate provision for loan losses.\nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness\n146. In addition to the standard conditions, the PCC will have been established in a manner\nacceptable to ADB.\nC. Conditions for Disbursement\n147. No funds from the project credit line will be disbursed until all necessary start-up training\nhas been completed, and a sufficient number of SCUs satisfying the requirements agreed to by\nthe Government and ADB have been legally registered.  Prior to disbursement of any funds\nunder the credit line through a PFI, a subsidiary loan agreement, acceptable to ADB, between\nMOFE and the PFI will have been executed. Prior to the commencement of phase II of the\nProject, the Government will have established a legal and regulatory framework acceptable to\nADB with respect to the regulation and supervision of SCUs, including determination of the\nGovernment agency responsible for such regulation and supervision.", "3344\nVII.

Introduction\n1. According to the Living Standards Measurement Survey (LSMS) conducted in 1998 by\nthe National Statistical Office supported by the World Bank, the incidence of poverty in Mongolia\nis very high. Around 36 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, equivalent to\n900,000  people,  and  about  20  percent  live  in  extreme  poverty.1  The  most  recent  official\nestimates show that poverty is predominantly urban with 57.2 percent of the poor residing in\nurban areas and 42.8 percent in rural areas. However, following consecutive dzuds (severe\nwinter weather) in 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, and a widespread outbreak of foot and mouth\ndisease, the incidence of poverty in rural areas has increased. Social indicators of poverty have\nalso deteriorated during the transition to a market economy. Problems of malnutrition among\nchildren under five and the prevalence of low birth rates have raised concerns about food\nsecurity. Previous achievements in education have been eroded; access by the poor is reduced,\nand literacy and preschool attendance have fallen dramatically.2 Enrollment in grades 1 to 8\ndeclined  from  99  percent  in  1990  to  82  percent  in  1997.  While  concerted  efforts  by  the\nGovernment have reversed the trend and increased enrollment rates to 90 percent, the previous\ndecline has resulted in many children whose capacities in the long term have been impaired by\ntheir years of lost education.\n2. Unemployment is officially 6.5 percent3 covering 39,000 people, but actual levels are\nundeniably higher. Real unemployment (after adjusting for persons employed outside the formal\nsector) ranges from about 17 to 23 percent of the population. Aimag centers in particular have\nsuffered  from  massive  redundancies  in  private  firms  and  public  services.  Many  displaced\nhouseholds have been absorbed into the informal sector and own or tend small livestock herds\nto provide basic subsistence needs and security. Loss of employment is the most prevalent\ncause of impoverishment in Mongolia.4 Nearly 58 percent of all unemployed are poor.\n3. Agriculture is the main source of income in rural areas and employment in the sector has\nrisen significantly. Its share in total employment increased from a third in 1990 to 50 percent in\n2000.  The  increasing  level  of  employment  and  a  shift  to  livestock  husbandry  reflects  the\ntendency for the unemployed to resort to small-scale herding as a means of subsistence in the\nabsence of alternative employment opportunities and limited welfare payment from the state.\nThe majority of rural households (66.8 percent) have less than 100 animals,5 which make them\nextremely vulnerable to risks associated with natural disasters and price fluctuations. Economic\nactivities outside agriculture include small-scale agroprocessing and microenterprises in areas\nsuch as trading, retailing, woodworking, and tailoring. Most microenterprises are small family\nconcerns that operate on a part-time basis, mainly as a result of lack of credit and working\ncapital. Public sector institutions are the other main source of employment in rural areas, such\nas local administrations, education and health sectors, etc. In these sectors too, employees\n                  \n1  National Statistical Office. 1998.

This excludes first time labor market entrants ineligible for labor registry services and\nthose who perceive no value in registering. Hidden unemployment is estimated at 12 percent (Asian Development\nBank. 2000. A Poverty Reduction Strategy for ADB Operations in Mongolia. Manila).\n4  World Bank. 2000.

Poverty Indicators for the Pilot Aimags6\n4. The Project will operate in its pilot phase in four aimags: Arhangay, Dundgovi, Dzavhan,\nand Sukhbaatar. Estimates of the level of poverty in the four aimags vary according to their\nsource,  namely  the  rural  financial  services  demand  survey  conducted  during  the  project\npreparatory  Technical  Assistance  (TA),  aimag  statistics  from  the  respective  aimag\nadministrations, and national statistics from the National Statistical Office. The poverty level in\nthe four aimags is estimated at 40 percent in Arhangay, 43 percent in Dundgovi, 43 percent in\nDzavhan, and 23 percent in Sukhbaatar. Estimates for Dundgovi and Sukhbaatar are derived\nfrom Government statistics and are considered to underestimate the actual level of poverty at\nthe aimag and national levels. The LSMS by comparison indicates a national average of 36\npercent in 1998. Table A2.1 presents poverty and social indicators for the four aimags.\n5. The level of poverty, particularly in rural areas, is likely to have increased over the last\ntwo years as a result of consecutive dzuds. Although livestock losses occur every year during\nwinter, in 1999/2000 certain parts of Mongolia experienced their worst winter for 30 years. A\nserious loss of livestock, accounting for over 2 million animals by April 2000, was suffered by 13\naimags. This directly affected 500,000 people equal to 20 percent of the population. All four pilot\naimags were affected; in Dundgovi for instance about 30 percent of all livestock were lost,\nleaving 160 households without any animals at all.\n6. Poverty  is  directly  linked  to  unemployment.  Three  of  the  pilot  aimags  have\nunemployment rates higher than the national average. Additionally, all four aimags have a high\nproportion of households headed by women and households with many members, indicating a\nhigh prevalence of vulnerable households. The education dropout rate of herders\u2019 children is\nvery high, reflecting both the increasing use of children in labor intensive livestock herding, and\nthe remoteness, poor conditions and increased costs of schooling. In terms of health, infant\nmortality rates in Arhangay, Dundgovi, and Sukhbaatar are higher than the national average.\nC.  Access to Rural Financial Services for Poor Groups\n7. Availability of and access to financial services in rural areas is limited. It is particularly\nsevere  for  poor  groups  who  are  unable  to  satisfy  the  eligibility  criteria  of  formal  financial\ninstitutions. Government credit programs such as the National Poverty Alleviation Program and\nLocal Development Funds have also failed to reach the poor because of poor operational\nperformance or lack of adequate funding. In the absence of adequate formal financial services,\nthe major source of credit in rural areas is the informal sector, which consists of itinerant traders,\nkiosk  (retail)  operators,  and  in  the  more  densely  populated  aimag  centers,  pawnbroker\noperations. For the most part, even these informal sources are beyond the reach of many poor\nhouseholds given their requirement for collateral to support borrowing. For those with very low\nlevels of income, local kiosks provide small amounts of credit in-kind in the form of basic\nnecessities.\n8.

Such borrowing occurs on a regular basis,\nand is often without interest and for an indefinite period. The TA survey indicated that in soum\ncenters and rural areas, around 75 percent of households rely on relatives for emergency cash.\nAmong herders, as many as 88 percent of households rely on this form of informal borrowing.\n9. According  to  the  participatory  living  standards  assessment  (footnote  4),  the  most\ncommon reasons for needing credit in rural areas are to meet food and other basic consumption\nneeds and to cover emergencies. At the aimag and soum centers, demand is more likely to be\nfor credit to expand an existing source of income or to start a new business. Other common\nreasons for taking loans are to cover school and college fees, to repay earlier debt, and to\nprovide for basic needs.\n10. Formal savings mobilization in rural areas is low. According to the TA survey, few\nhouseholds have savings to draw on in case of urgent need; only 4 percent of respondents\nwould use savings in these circumstances. The importance of access to saving facilities for poor\npeople has often been ignored and underestimated in microfinance programs. Poor people are\nassumed to need credit to generate income with little or no attention paid to accumulation of\nwealth in the form of savings. Experience with credit unions, however, is that poor people have\na much higher demand for savings facilities than for credit.7 According to the survey, 26 percent\nof  rural  household  reported  that  they  had  surplus  cash,  but  in  the  absence  of  savings\nopportunities (based on a general distrust of existing financial institutions) such cash is often\nspent on additional consumption or converted into consumer durables.\nD.  Membership of Savings and Credit Unions\n11. Little analysis has been undertaken of the socioeconomic characteristics of members of\nexisting savings and credit unions (SCUs) in Mongolia. Results of a study undertaken by the\nUnited Nations Development Programme\u2019s Microstart program in June 1999 are shown in Table\nA2.1.\nTable A2.1: Poverty Classification of SCU Members\nCategory Active clients (percent)\nVulnerable nonpoor 30\nModerate poor 59\nPoor 10\nExtremely poor 1\n12. The definition of the various poverty categories used in the study does not correspond\nwith the widely accepted official definition of poverty in Mongolia. Moderate poor is defined,\namong other things, as individuals belonging to a household with a monthly income less than\n$100 per month (approximately MNT100,000) which is above the official poverty line. The\nofficial poverty line is MNT13,800 to MNT16,400 per capita per month in rural areas; or a\nmonthly income of MNT62,100 to MNT73,800 per household based on an average household\nsize of 4.5 persons. Based on these findings and on discussions with SCUs during project\npreparation, the perception is that the majority of clients may not be poor, but low-income\ngroups who have a business already and need working capital.\n                  \n7 In addition to the obvious benefits of savings accumulation for the poor, two significant benefits for the institution\nare (i) total economic independence from external financing at more favorable rates, and (ii) abundant liquidity for\nonlending.

During the period of transition in Mongolia, the economic and social independence of\nwomen has been severely undermined. As state enterprises closed or reduced their work\nforces, women lost more jobs relative to men and were the first to be laid off. After disintegration\nof state farms and privatization of their livestock and machinery, more than 20,000 trained\nwomen  lost  their  jobs.8  Women  account  for  54  percent  of  the  unemployed.  In  addition,\nMongolian women lost the strong social support that had previously freed them from their\ntraditional responsibility for family care. Reduction in health and/or social services resulted in\nwomen having to spend more time caring for the young, sick, and/or elderly. In practice women\ntend to have less job security than men, less access to information, and less access to credit\nfrom the formal banking system.9\n14. SCUs are potentially very important for women. First, women have difficulty accessing\nfinancial services and SCUs offer a real alternative. Second, credit unions are able to offer loans\nfor household emergencies, education, health, etc., which are generally not available from\nformal financial institutions, and all of which involve women in the household decision-making\nprocess.\n15. Existing  SCUs  in  Mongolia  are  dominated  by  women.  Many  have  developed  from\nwomen\u2019s nongovernment organizations (NGOs), including one of biggest, Moncord, which was\nfounded in 1997 on the initiative of 15 members of the NGO, the Liberal Women\u2019s Brain Pool\n(LEOS). As of June 2001, in those SCUs for which data are available, approximately 60-70\npercent of all members are women.\nF.  Expected Poverty and Social Impact of the Project\n16. The Project will provide enhanced access to credit and savings services, the lack of\nwhich has been identified as a primary constraint to rural development and poverty reduction.\nThe Project will increase the outreach of financial services to rural and poor areas through the\nestablishment  of  SCUs.  Well-functioning  SCUs  will  enhance  public  confidence  in  financial\nsystems, and in turn increase savings mobilization. A sound and efficient financial system will\nfacilitate efficient resource allocation, which is a prerequisite for private sector development.\n17. The  provision  of  a  wide  range  of  financial  services  to  improve  housing,  health,\neducation, etc., and to meet emergency needs has a positive impact on the quality of life. SCUs\nalso strengthen social capital within local communities, and members\u2019 ability to participate in\ndemocratic processes. Greater social cohesion that will result from SCU development will have\na positive social impact by reducing population migration from soum centers and rural areas to\naimag centers, thereby reducing pressure on social services in those areas.\n18. On the basis of one SCU member per household and 4.5 persons per household, some\n22,100 people can be expected to benefit from SCU membership: 12,000 members will be in 60\naimag center SCUs and 10,100 will be in 270 soum-level SCUs. At the household level, the total\nnumber of beneficiaries is expected to reach almost 100,000. Although the proportion of poor in\nexisting SCU membership is lower than the average proportion of the poor in rural populations,\nexisting SCUs are largely centered in Ulaanbaatar where the incidence of poverty is lower than\nin rural areas. Also, given that SCUs established under the Project and the majority of members\n                  \n8  United  Nations  Development  Fund  for  Women.  2000.

In addition, SCU membership will benefit those groups\nliving just above the poverty line who may be vulnerable in terms of lack of assets, including\nsavings to manage crisis situations.\n19. The promotion of participation of the poor in the SCUs is supported by the setting of the\nmembership fee at a level affordable by the poor ($5) and the promotion and training activities\nspecially focused on the poor. This amount is considered feasible on the basis of (i) the size of\ncontributions that would be possible according to households covered by the survey; and (ii) the\nminimum share level of existing SCUs, which include poor members.\n20. Over time, access to credit through rural SCUs will address the issue of employment\ngeneration. The Project will create new employment opportunities as credit provided to SCU\nmembers is used to develop and expand small businesses. The survey indicated that 75\npercent of potential SCU members will borrow for establishing or rehabilitating enterprises.\nAssuming that all such enterprises are owner-operated, employment will be created for some\n16,500  people.  Some  of  this  employment  will  be  part  time  or,  in  the  case  of  agriculture,\nseasonal. Successful enterprises that expand may also increase the number of employment\nopportunities.\n21. The Project will address the need for training and information services in rural areas, by\nestablishing information and resource centers (IRCs) in the four pilot aimags. The IRCs will\nprovide  training  courses  and  workshops  covering  a  range  of  livelihood  issues,  including\nprinciples  of  microfinance,  community  participation,  specific  women\u2019s  issues,  health  and\nnutrition,  etc.  Training  courses  and  workshops  are  expected  to  reach  a  total  of  29,000\nparticipants, 4,000 in training courses and 25,000 in workshops. As training and information will\nbe targeted to the needs of the poor, at least during the pilot phase of the Project, 50 percent of\nall the total number of training activities will be reserved for poor and vulnerable groups. The\nnumber of poor benefiting from training is estimated at 15,000. Information campaigns are\nexpected to reach many more.\n22. Training and workshops will provide participants with tools necessary to improve their\nliving standards. The IRC facilities will be open for a variety of groups wishing to organize\ntraining. For example, line ministries that want to organize skills training at local level, NGOs,\nlocal organizations, etc. The IRCs will also act as an important resource for raising awareness\namong rural populations about SCUs and other socioeconomic issues.\n23. The  Project  will  monitor  the  poverty  impact  of  the  Project.  Additionally,  an  impact\nassessment  study  will  explore  in-depth  the  processes  of  change  and  the  impact  of  SCU\nmembership on the livelihood of poor groups. One significant output from the study will be\npoverty sensitive measures to be included in the project design after the pilot phase.", "45\n                                                                                                                Appendix 2, page 6\nTable A2.2: Poverty Profile of Pilot Aimagsa\nItem Arkhangi Dundgovi Sukhbaatar Dzavhan Mongolia\nPopulation (\u2018000) 104.3 54.8 59.7 104.0 2,446.4\nPopulation (\u2018000) 2000 97.0 51.5 56.2 89.9\nHouseholds (\u2018000) 24.7 12.3 12.8 21.6 542.3\nHouseholds (\u2018000) 2000 24.4 12.2 12.7 21.6\nPercentage of households\nengaged in agriculture 83.6 78.6 74.4 74.5\n(2000)\nPercentage of households\nheaded by women 10.1 8.7 7.3 12.7 10.2\n(2000)\nPercentage of households\nheaded by women 8.3 9.5 9.1 11.7 n/a\n(1998)\nPercentage of households\nwith over four children 10.8 9.4 4.5 12.4 14.0\nUnemployed 1,950 n/a 1,100 3,200 39,767\nOfficial unemployment rate\n(percent) 16.0 3.7 14.8 28.1 4.6\nPercentage of women\nunemployed 56.0 60.0 48.0 56.0 54.0\nPercentage of unemployed\nseeking workb 44.6 45.5 55.6 46.7 n/a\nPercentage of households\nbelow the poverty linec 40.0 43.0 23.0d 43.0 36.0\nPercentage of herder\nhouseholds 73.5 66.1 56.1 61.6 35.0\na Data for 1999 except where noted.\nb National Statistics Office. 2000.

Background\n1. The formal financial sector does not adequately serve the rural population of Mongolia,\nwhich accounts for 66 percent of the total population. As a result of a series of banking crises\nduring the 1990s, which saw a number of bank closures, consolidation, or restructuring, the\nbanking system suffers from widespread public distrust. In rural areas, this is exacerbated by a\nlack of adequate financial services in savings, credit, and money transfers. Only three banks\nhave a network of branches in rural areas. The Agricultural Bank of Mongolia recommenced\nlending operations in November 2000 following an aid-supported restructuring program though it\nis not yet providing credit through all its rural branches. The Mongol Post Bank is currently\noffering short-term credit, on a very limited basis, to larger agricultural enterprises. The Savings\nBank obtained a lending license in April 2001 and is currently developing its lending policies and\nstrategy.\n2. Few  alternative  financial  institutions  provide  essential  services  to  the  rural  areas.\nNonbank financial institutions, notably the Golden Fund for Development and Goviin Ekhel (both\nexternally supported initiatives) have limited presence in aimag centers but only provide credit to\nsmall- and medium-size enterprises and do not have savings or transfer services. Savings and\ncredit cooperatives exist in small numbers (approximately 100 as of June 2001), but are at an\nearly stage of development and so far have little representation outside of Ulaanbaatar. The\ninformal sector provides credit through pawnbrokers and through retail kiosks. In many soum\ncenters, kiosks are the only source of credit. The extended family system offers the most\nimportant financial safety net for most people in rural areas who find themselves in urgent need\nof funds.\n3. Where credit is available, interest rates are extremely high, particularly in the informal\nsector  where  interest  rates  of  10  to  15  percent  per  month  are  common.  Even  among\ncommercial banks, large spreads exist between deposit and lending rates: as of June 2001, the\nSavings Bank reported a rate of 1 percent per month on time deposits and 2 to 3.2 percent per\nmonth for loans; the Mongol Post Bank indicated deposit rates of 8 to 10 percent and loan rates\nof 26 to 36 percent per year. With inflation estimated between 6 and 8 percent, these interest\nspreads represent significant margins for administration costs and credit risk, reflecting the high\nlevel of loan transaction costs and the perceived economic risks faced by many enterprises. At\npresent, virtually all credit provided is short term, an estimated 95 percent of outstanding loans\nhave a maturity of less than one year. Table A3.1 provides a summary of current levels of\ninterest rates in the formal and informal sectors and in ongoing and proposed ADB projects that\ninclude a line of credit.", "47\n                                                                                                                       Appendix 3, page 2\nTable A3.1: Interest Rate Structure Selected Financial Institutions and ADB Projects\n(Annual Rate)\nADB\nAgriculture\nSector\nPercentage ADB Rural ADB Housing Development Commercial\nRates Finance Project Finance Project Project Banks/NBFIsa Informal Sector\nExternal source\nof funds through 10-12 14.4 10-12 \u2014 n/a\nGovernment\nRates paid on 24-36 \u2014 \u2014 8.0 - 10.0 \u2014\ndeposits (SCU savings)\nOnlending rate 24 20 20 36 120-180\nfrom PFI to final (SCU)\nborrower\nSCU member 30-36 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\nborrowerb (SCU member)\n\u2014 = not applicable, ADB = Asian Development Bank, NBFI = nonbank financial institution, PFI = participating financial institution,\nSCU = savings and credit union.\na   Mongol Post Bank rates are used to illustrate both commercial banks\u2019 and NBFI\u2019s rates which are comparable in rural areas\nbased upon data from XAC.

Key aggregate data for urban and rural savings and credit unions (SCUs) as of March\n2001 are shown in Table A3.2. Average membership was 11 per rural SCU and 37 per urban\nSCU. Combined member shares and savings deposits averaged $200 per member in rural\nSCUs and $720 per member in urban SCUs. Total loans outstanding was $77,000 for rural\nSCUs, an average of $2,100 per SCU. For urban SCUs, total loans outstanding stood at $1.2\nmillion, an average of $26,000 per SCU. Data on the number of members borrowing, and\ntherefore average loan sizes are not available.\nTable A3.2: Savings and Credit Unions in Mongolia\n(as of March 2001)\nAverage Average\nShares/ Savings/\nShares Member Savings Member Loans\nSCUs Members (MNT \u2018000)\nRural 37     417     64,100 154   26,600   64      84,600\nUrban 49 1,699    917,800 540 421,100 248 1,316,100\nTotal 86 2,116 1,024,700 475 453,000 210 1,442,700\nSCU = savings and credit union.\nSource: SCU Apex Organizations.

One of the more\nmature SCUs, Moncord, provided financial statements for 2000 indicating a loan portfolio at the\nend of the year of $86,600, representing 96 percent of total assets ($90,500). The cumulative\nloan loss provision stood at 2.6 percent of total loans outstanding. Total equity was $37,000, of\nwhich  $25,300  (68  percent)  was  in  the  form  of  shareholders  contributions.

After allowing for loan loss\nprovision and taxes, Moncord returned a net profit of $9,600. Data for 1999 for the five credit\ncooperatives (including Moncord) established under the Employment Generation Project show\nan average membership of 70, of which women comprise an average of 69 percent. Average\ncapital amounted to $22,000 and loans outstanding at 31 October 1999 averaged $27,000.\nAverage loan sizes ranged from $250 to $15,000 with monthly interest rates from 5 to 8 percent.\nThe  recovery  rate  on  loans  from  commercial  banks  to  the  credit  cooperatives  under  the\nEmployment Generation Project averaged 93 percent, having risen from 37 percent in 1995 to\n95 percent in 1998. By the end of 1999, loan collection rates were above 98 percent with the\nexception  of  one  cooperative  for  which  it  was  90  percent.1  These  credit  unions  have\ndemonstrated their viability and sustainability over the four years since they were established in\nspite of economic  difficulties  faced by Mongolia during 1998. In the case of Moncord for which\n2000 data exists, impressive growth has also been demonstrated. Since October 1999, savings\ndeposits, capital, and loans outstanding have demonstrated well-balanced growth, all increasing\nfour fold.\nC.  Commercial Banks Identified for Participation in the Rural Finance Project\n6. Three commercial banks (Mongol Post Bank, Golomt Bank, and Savings Bank) have\nbeen identified as potential participating financial institutions (PFIs) and have agreed in principle\nto participate in the Rural Finance Project. Mongol Post Bank and Golomt Bank meet the PFI\neligibility criteria (Appendix 8) at this time. A more detailed analysis of these banks is available\nin Supplementary Appendix C. Savings Bank has only recently been given a lending license by\nthe Bank of Mongolia (BOM) and does not meet the criterion that a PFI should have been\nlicensed for at least one year. Two other banks, Anod and Zoos, have expressed interest in\nacting as PFIs. Since the operation of the credit line will not commence until the third quarter of\nyear 1 of the Project (2002), the eligibility of all banks will be reviewed at that time.\n1.  Mongol Post Bank\n7. Mongol Post Bank (MPB) was created in 1993 and is 4.9 percent owned by the state\nthrough shareholdings from Mongol Telecom and Mongol Post Company, and 95.1 percent by\nthe private sector (with an approximately equal split between private enterprises and private\nindividuals). MPB commenced operations with five branches in Ulaanbaatar and is currently\nrepresented in every aimag with a total of 27 branches; it also has 22 subbranches located in\nsoum centers, mainly in Hovd and Selenge aimags. Approximately 180 persons are employed\nby MPB, 67 at the head office and the remainder in the branches and subbranches.\n8. The  main  income  generating  activities  of  MPB  are  (i)  disbursement  of  pension\npayments, local government salaries, and other benefits for a fee; (ii) distribution of central\nGovernment  subsidies  to  local  authorities;  (iii)  remittance  of  taxes  and  social  insurance\ncontributions to central Government offices; and (iv) cash disbursement services for local petrol\nstations owned by Neft Import Concern.\n9. Lending activities are relatively restricted and confined primarily to Ulaanbaatar-based\nenterprises. The bank\u2019s primary borrowers are Mongol Telecom, Neft Import Concern, and the\nstate electricity authorities. Deposit-taking is carried out on a very small scale. This lack of\ntraditional banking activity is reflected in the bank\u2019s low loan to total asset ratio of 52 percent,\n                  \n1 PCR: 26450-MON: Employment Generation Project, June 2000.", "49\n                                                                                                                       Appendix 3, page 4\nlow ratio of interest income to total income at 46 percent, and a relatively low loan to deposit\nratio of 65 percent.\n10. MPB has announced an expansion of its financial activities in its current business plan,\nincluding (i) an increase in small lending activities through its aimag branches; (ii) expansion of\nlending activities into trading (60 percent), gold mining (30 percent), and meat and cashmere\nprocessing (10 percent); and (iii) increasing the terms of loans for working capital to a maximum\nof 1 year. However, no plan seems to be in place to actively mobilize individual or corporate\nsavings.\n11. MPB has been selected by ADB as a PFI in Hovd aimag to disburse part of a $5 million\nline of credit under the Agriculture Sector Development Program.\n2.  Golomt Bank\n12. Golomt Bank, formed in 1995, currently has eight branches in Ulaanbaatar, and one\neach in Darhan and Erdenet aimags, and employs a total staff of 150. It has no immediate plans\nto  open  branches  in  rural  areas  due  to  perceived  cost  constraints  and  low  potential  for\nprofitability. It is wholly owned by a private sector enterprise, Bodi Financial Services Company.\nThis company also owns a general insurance company, a leasing company specializing in gold\nmining equipment and motor vehicles, and a property development company.\n13. The bank has adopted an aggressive but prudent lending policy as part of its strategic\nbusiness plan. The main customer base consists of small- and medium-size enterprises to\nwhich the bank provides loans up to a maximum of MNT3 million and for a maximum term of six\nmonths. They have a development loan program for loans up to a maximum value of MNT500\nmillion, with a maximum term of one year. Internal loan management policy prohibits lending\nmore than 20 percent of its total outstanding portfolio to any one economic sector. The bank has\nbeen  actively  involved  with  the  assistance  community,  been  identified  as  a  participating\ncommercial  bank  in  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  proposed  housing  finance  loan,  and\nparticipated in two World Bank project loans, one for food processing and one for a printing\noperation.\n3.  Savings Bank\n14. The Savings Bank was created as a state bank during the 1996 sector restructuring\nprogram as a safe haven to absorb and protect individuals\u2019 deposits. It has a branch network of\nnine aimag branches and 27 soum subbranches, and accounts for one third of all deposits in\nthe  banking  system,  with  over  200,000  individual  deposit  accounts.  Until  recently,  the\nGovernment\u2019s failure to service the bank restructuring bonds that make up over 75 percent of its\nassets resulted in negative cash flows and operating losses. BOM has, therefore, given the\nbonds a 100 percent risk weight, resulting in an inadequate risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio\nof 7.1 percent. This situation has been improving steadily and in April 2001, BOM issued\nSavings Bank a full banking license enabling it to commence lending operations. The bank is\nadopting a cautious lending policy that has been approved by BOM, and is limiting loan size to\n$40,000 and loan terms to one year. It also has a ceiling on its total loan portfolio. Interest rates\nrange from 2 to 3 percent per month compared with interest paid on time deposit accounts of 1\npercent per month. The bank is keen to participate in the Rural Finance Project as a means of\nenhancing its services in rural areas.

The  Mongolian  National  Federation  of  Savings  and  Credit  Unions  (MNFSCU)  was\nestablished  in  June  1998  by  nine  Ulaanbaatar  based  savings  and  credit  unions  (SCUs).\nMNFSCU enjoyed steady growth until April 1999 when a faction split to form what is now the\nNational Confederation of Credit Unions of Mongolia (NACCUM). Membership then remained\nsteady at 12 until the last quarter of 2000. MNFSCU undertook a major reorganization in\nNovember 2000, which culminated in a membership drive and a change in leadership. The\nprevious president was replaced by an individual with 25 years experience with Mongolian\nbanking and a higher educational degree in banking. Five of the nine member board have\nfinancial backgrounds. The membership drive attracted 25 new member SCUs, of which 15 are\nrural. Since November 2000, MNFSCU has taken on two part-time staff, an executive director,\nand an accountant. The executive director has a master\u2019s degree in banking and 10 years\nexperience with banking in Mongolia, and is a certified teacher with the Mongolian Banking\nTraining Center. The executive director is also a board member of MNFSCU. The accountant is\nan accountant by profession and has two years financial management experience with Moncord\nSCU.\n2. Members of MNFSCU\u2019s board have attended and helped to organize a variety of training\nseminars sponsored by foreign agencies on SCU development and promotion, management,\nand accounting procedures. MNFSCU has in turn carried out training and information seminars.\nWhere financial support was required, it was supplied by the Liberal Women\u2019s Brain Pool\n(LEOS). MNFSCU is actively engaged in discussions with the Government on financial sector\nreform and has members serving on the Policy Group on the Banking and Nonbanking Sector,\nthe Working Group on SCU Development of the Ministry of Social Welfare and Labor, and the\nParliamentary Subcommittee on Legislation for Nonbanking Institutions.\n3. MNFSCU has capital of MNT1.2 million and made a net loss of MNT46,600 on income\nof MNT211,300 in 2000. MNFSCU was unable to provide financial statements for previous\nyears.\nB.  National Confederation of Credit Unions in Mongolia\n4. NACCUM was formed from a splinter group of MNFSCU in April 1999. As of September\n2000, NACCUM has 30 member SCUs of which six are rural. NACCUM changed leadership on\n1  March  2001.  The  new  president  is  a  former  member  of  parliament  and  a  teacher  by\nprofession, and has experience with herder cooperatives but not with SCUs. Resumes of other\ndirectors were not available. NACCUM employs one full-time executive director and recruits\nother staff on a part-time basis as required. The resume of the executive director was not\navailable.\n5. NACCUM has been active in developing model bylaws for SCUs and a standard chart of\naccounts.  The  standard  chart  of  accounts  was  prepared  in  conjunction  with  NetMon  with\nsupport from Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and has been provided to the\ntax authorities for approval. NACCUM intends to produce a variety of standard forms and\nmanuals for SCU use.", "51\nAppendix 4, page 2\n6. NACCUM\u2019s operating plan for 2001 focuses on promotion of SCUs through public media\nand by developing four regional model SCUs. The model SCUs are to be established in the\naimag centers of Bayanhongor, Bayan-Olgiy, Darhan-Uul, and Dornod.\n7. NACCUM was unable to provide any financial statements. It\u2019s operating plan appears to\nbe heavily reliant on financial support from GTZ and other, as yet unidentified, international\norganizations.\nC.  NetMon\n8. NetMon was licensed as a nonbank financial institution (NBFI) by the Bank of Mongolia\n(BOM) in July 2000. It\u2019s initial shareholders were four (now six) SCUs, 13 private investors, and\none consulting company. The president of NetMon has a master\u2019s in business administration\nfrom the University of Rochester; the other directors all have degrees in finance or economics,\nand experience in the financial sector including SCUs, microfinance, and banking. NetMon\nemploys three full-time staff and a part-time executive director.\n9. NetMon  enforces  financial  discipline  with  its  borrowers  by  applying  prudent  lending\npolicies. Since inception NetMon has made 14 loans to SCUs. It has also worked with other\napex organizations to establish a standard chart of accounts for SCUs and has provided training\nto potential borrowers to strengthen their operating procedures. NetMon was capitalized by\nshare subscriptions of MNT13.5 million by founding members at the outset, and was therefore\nable to begin lending activities and earn revenues immediately. NetMon was also able to attract\nprivate sector loans for onlending purposes.\n10. In January 2001, NetMon received a $13,000 capital grant and a $137,000 loan from the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (for 5 years at 10 percent per year) to onlend to\nSCUs. Prior to receiving the loan, NetMon\u2019s capital adequacy was 38 percent. After receipt of\nthe loan and capital grant, NetMon\u2019s capital represented 14.7 percent of total assets, which\nmeets the BOM requirement of 10 percent. NetMon was required to draw the entire loan in a\nlump sum and incurred a significant loss on interest prior to full disbursement as it employs a\nsound lending policy that requires a detailed assessment of potential borrower SCUs, based not\nonly on financial prudence but also the requirement that SCUs operate according to cooperative\nprinciples. As of May 2001, NetMon had disbursed all of the loan funds. Loans to SCUs are\neither progress loans (three months minimum and interest at 3 percent per month) for first time\nborrowers, or partnership loans (10 months minimum and interest at 2 percent per month).\nProgress loans have a minimum value of $500, and partnership loans a minimum of $1,500 with\nboth being subject to a maximum equal to 80 percent of the SCU\u2019s capital. Loans from SCUs to\nmembers range from $100 to $500.\n11. As  part  of  the  loan  agreement,  NetMon  is  required  to  provide  quarterly  financial\nstatements of its borrowers to BOM, and so is developing its reporting and monitoring systems.\nNetMon also received the support of a part-time technical advisor from the United Nations\nDevelopment Programme for six months, which ended in June 2001.", "52\nAppendix 5, page 1\nTRAINING PROGRAM SUMMARY\nA. Training for Savings and Credit Unions\n1. Training of savings and credit union (SCU) directors and staff is essential to ensure\nsound growth of the SCU movement in Mongolia. The international adviser assigned to the\ncredit  union  service  organization  (CUSO)  will  be  responsible  for  developing  a  stand-alone\nmodular curriculum for SCU training that can be delivered by the CUSO staff or other accredited\ntrainers. The international adviser will also be responsible for devising an accreditation system\nfor external local trainers. The use of local trainers will be encouraged. A summary training\nschedule is presented in Supplementary Appendix F, Table F.1, and a curriculum outline in\nTable F.2.\n2. Although it is assumed that the CUSO will recruit staff with financial backgrounds and\naccounting skills, all existing and future CUSO staff will be required to complete the entire\ntraining program before they can begin training SCU directors and staff. All the CUSO staff\ninvolved in training will also participate in a training of trainers course to be conducted at the\nstart of the Project by the project management unit (PMU).\n3. To determine the training needs of newly formed SCUs in the pilot aimags, each SCU is\nassumed to have a board consisting of five members, a credit committee (three members), an\naudit committee (three members), and a staff of two. Training will be undertaken in a series of\none week courses at the aimag center. Board members and audit committee members will\nreceive  two  training  courses;  others  one  course.  These  assumptions  have  been  used  to\ndetermine the total training requirement during the pilot phase of the Project, which equates to a\ntotal of 80 weeks of training in year 1 (for SCUs existing at the end of 2001 and those created in\nyear 1), 40 weeks in year 2 and 12 weeks in year 3. Although 80 weeks of training are required\nin year 1, this level of training is thought to be unsustainable and 48 weeks of training per year\nis a more reasonable level. Hence in year 3, 36 weeks of excess capacity will be utilized in\nnonpilot aimags. Nonpilot aimag SCUs will be responsible for 50 percent of training costs.\nTherefore the number of participants per SCU will be reduced; and individual training sessions\nwill reach a greater number of SCUs.\n4. The costs of providing this training are included in the operating costs of the CUSO. In\naddition, costs will be associated with travel, accommodation, and subsistence of SCU officers\ncoming from soums to aimag centers for training. Travel is based on an average of 100\nkilometers between each soum and the aimag center at a cost of $20. Participant costs for\naccommodation  and  subsistence  are  estimated  at  $5  and  $4  respectively.  Finally,  $30  is\nallowed for preparation of all materials (handouts) for participants. This results in a total cost for\nparticipants of $60,500 over the three years of the Project\u2019s pilot phase. The cost for trainers is\nestimated to be $20 per day inclusive of remuneration, travel costs, and subsistence. Each\ntraining session includes five days of training plus two travel days. For pilot SCUs these costs\nwill be fully covered. Nonpilot SCUs will be required to cover 50 percent of trainers\u2019 costs and\n100 percent of participants\u2019 costs. Thus 12 weeks of training in year 3 are estimated at $20 per\nday and 36 weeks at $10 per day. This brings the total cost of trainers during the pilot phase to\n$21,000. A one-time cost for curriculum preparation is included for 2 weeks of preparation for\neach week of delivery. Six course weeks require 12 weeks of preparation at a cost of $150 per\nweek for a total of $1,800. The total cost of training during the Project\u2019s pilot phase is estimated\nat $83,300.", "  53\nAppendix 5, page 2\nB. Training through Information Resource Centers\n5. The establishment of information resource centers (IRCs) will be based on a training\nneeds assessment to be conducted in the four pilot aimags within the first six months of project\nimplementation. The assessment will include (i) identification of potential training facilities in the\naimag centers, (ii) assessment of existing training activities carried out in the aimags, (iii) review\nof previous training activities and identification of lessons learned, and (iv) identification of\ntraining  and  information  needs  in  the  aimag.  Terms  of  reference  for  the  training  needs\nassessment will be prepared by the PMU, and the PMU will be responsible for recruiting four\ndomestic consultants to carry out the training need assessment. On completion, the PMU will\nreview the assessment in each aimag and, as appropriate, establish each IRC at the aimag\ncenter and recruit necessary staff. In consultation with the PMU and local aimag organizations,\nand based upon the findings of the training needs assessments, each IRC director will develop\nand implement aimag-specific training programs.\n6. Training will be undertaken in 6 five-day training courses per year per aimag at the\naimag center, 20 one-day workshops per year per aimag at the aimag center, 8 three-day\ntraining courses per year per aimag at one soum center to cover 4-5 surrounding soums, and 2\none-days workshops per year at each soum center.\n7. The objective of the IRCs is to provide training and information to communities in the\nfour pilot aimags, with specific focus on poor groups. The training and information activities will\nfocus on a wide spectrum of training activities, from skills training to social and community\nissues. Subject matter specialists for each course and workshop will be drawn from local\ncommunities;  nongovernment  organizations;  local  administration;  and  agriculture,  health,\neducation, finance, and industry sectors, etc.\n8. Training and information activities may include the following:\n(i)  skills training to SCU members and the general public, notably the unemployed\nand poor;\n(ii)  information campaigns to identify employment opportunities;\n(iii)  basic business management and financial training to existing and local potential\nentrepreneurs;\n(iv)  specialized training and information campaigns by Government ministries, for\ninstance, extension training by the Ministry of Agriculture; and\n(v)  specialized training and information campaigns by nongovernment organizations\nand  other  institutions,  based  on  adequate  expertise  in  social,  health,  and\ncommunity issues.\n9. While training and information will be available to all sections of local communities, it will\naim to facilitate the expansion of SCU membership and access for the poor and vulnerable\ngroups. As such, 50 percent of all training places will be reserved for the poor and vulnerable.\n10. Supplementary  Appendix  F,  Table  F.3  provides  illustrative  training  needs  identified\nduring project preparation.", "54\nAppendix 6, page 1\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n1. The  following  tables  present  summary  and  detailed  project  costs  by  component,\nexpenditure account, and financiers.1\n2. All unit costs are based upon domestic prices estimated in Togrog (MNT) at the time of\ndata collection (June 2001). Foreign exchange costs have been converted at a rate of exchange\nof US$1 = MNT1,090, the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of November 2000 when data\ncollection was undertaken. No significant movement has taken place in either prices of project\ninputs or outputs or the exchange rate in the period between data collection and loan appraisal.2\nFor the purpose of preparing cost tables, these unit costs have been used to derive project base\ncosts and been entered into COSTAB in US dollar terms.\n3. It has been assumed that the Project will be implemented from the beginning of 2002.\nPrice contingencies have been applied at the rate of 10 percent for 2001, 6 percent for 2002, 5\npercent 2003, and 4 percent thereafter on all local costs. Price contingencies on foreign costs\nhave been applied at the rate of 2.4 percent per year between the time of data collection to\nproject startup and throughout project implementation. Price contingencies are based upon\ndomestic and foreign (US dollar) inflation rates derived from discussions with staff of the Bank of\nMongolia and Asian Development Bank (ADB) missions. No price contingency has been applied\nto the Project\u2019s line of credit to savings and credit unions (SCUs), or the contributions made to\nSCU\u2019s capital by their members.\n4. Physical contingencies have been applied at the rate of 5 percent on all costs with the\nexception of training and information dissemination costs for which a rate of 10 percent has\nbeen applied.\n5. All vehicles and equipment investments have been assumed to attract value-added tax\nat the standard rate of 13 percent. Where appropriate, foreign exchange costs have been\nestimated as a percentage of the unit cost of each item. Where no direct estimate of cost,\ninsurance, and freight (cif) price was available, the foreign exchange percentage was estimated\nafter subtracting local duties and taxes and dealer\u2019s margin, which is assumed to cover local\ntransportation and distribution costs, etc. All staff costs have been assumed to include social\nand health tax contributions of 19 percent of basic wage costs. In the absence of information on\nexactly  how  members  will  use  funds  borrowed  from  SCUs,  it  has  been  assumed  that  on\naverage 15 percent of all products and services purchased will represent either a direct or\nindirect foreign exchange cost. This foreign exchange percentage has been applied both to the\nline of credit and members\u2019 contributions to SCU capital and savings.\n6. The  credit  union  service  organization  (CUSO)  will  receive  project  support  for  the\npurchase of fixed assets and recurrent costs. These costs have been included in the cost\ntables. The SCUs will operate initially with volunteer board members and staff until they reach a\nmembership of 50 when they will employ their own staff. The SCUs will finance recurrent costs\nfrom revenues generated from operations and no costs have been included for the operation of\nthe SCUs themselves.\n                                                \n1  Cost  tables  have  been  derived  using  COSTAB  software  based  upon  cost  estimates  for  individual  project\ncomponents.\n2  As of June 2001, the exchange rate was $1 = MNT1,090.", "55 Appendix 6, page 2\nTable A6.1: Components Project Cost Summary\n($ \u2018000)\n% % Total\nLocal Foreign Total Foreign Base\nCurrency Currency Cost Exchange Costs\nA.

The project credit line will be available for all participating financial institutions (PFIs),\nboth commercial banks and nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), that meet agreed eligibility\ncriteria. NBFIs currently operating in Mongolia have yet to demonstrate sufficient experience\nwith credit operations for them to be eligible in the initial phase of the Project. Once such NBFIs,\nincluding the initial credit union service organization, NetMon, are able to meet the following\neligibility criteria, they will, subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance and Economy, Bank of\nMongolia (BOM), and Asian Development Bank (ADB), be entitled to access project funds for\nonlending to savings and credit unions.\nA.  Criteria for Initial Participation\n2. The PFIs will be thoroughly examined to ensure that they are in compliance with the\neligibility criteria at the time of assessment of eligibility. Throughout the project period, the\nproject management unit (PMU), in cooperation with BOM, will identify potential PFIs, undertake\nan initial assessment, and make a decision on the eligibility of a PFI. The eligibility criteria for\nPFIs are shown in Table A5.\nTable A5: Eligibility Criteria for PFIs to Participate in the Credit Line\n1. Legal Compliance\nLicensed  as  bank  or  nonbank  financial  institution A financial institution must have been registered and\n(NBFI) licensed under the Banking Law or under the relevant\nregulation for NBFIs for at least one year before\nacceptance as a participating financial institution (PFI)\n2.

General Structures and Procedures\nFinancial performance PFI to have satisfactory financial performance, as\nconfirmed by external audit of financial statements by\nindependent auditors acceptable to the Bank of Mongolia\n(BOM) and Asian Development Bank (ADB), in\naccordance with international accounting standards, for\nthe previous fiscal year\nAsset-liability management PFI to demonstrate acceptable policies and operational\nguidelines for interest rate and maturity gap management,\nlimits, and other related issues\nCorporate governance PFI to possess an active, independent, and experienced\nboard of directors\nInternal audita PFI to have an accounting system with adequate internal\ncontrols, an internal audit function, and an audit\ncommittee to which the PFI\u00b4s internal audit function\nreports directly\nManagement information system (MIS) PFI to have an MIS that permits monitoring to acceptable\nstandards of the quality of the loan portfolio on a regular\nbasis and provides a financial projection system (cash\nflow forecasting)\n4. Structures and Procedures for Lending Operations under the Credit Line\nLending experience PFI to have an acceptable record of lending to small-scale\nenterprises and individuals\nStaffing PFI to have adequate staff (sufficient number and quality)\nfor the prudent management of project funds\nLending policies and guidelines PFI to possess or to be prepared to develop, under the\nProject, lending policies and guidelines (such as loan\nappraisal and approval authorities, classification\nprocedures, monitoring requirements, collection\nprocedures, terms, and conditions) that are approved by\nBOM and regularly supervised. Policies should reflect the\nonlending terms and conditions agreed to in the subsidiary\nloan agreement between the PFI and Ministry of Finance\nand Economy, as well as the terms and conditions for\nborrowing savings and credit unions,\na The internal audit can be carried out based on domestic accounting standards.\nB.  Ongoing Eligibility Criteria for Participating Financial Institutions\n3. Throughout the Project, the PMU and BOM will monitor the PFIs on a quarterly basis to\ndetermine their continuing eligibility to participate in the project credit line. Throughout the\nproject period, PFIs will make audit reports and other financial records openly available to the\nPMU and ADB so that ongoing eligibility can be verified.\n4. In addition, for continued eligibility, each PFI will be expected to (i) have given at least\nfive subloans to savings and credit unions (SCUs) in the first year after signing the subsidiary\nloan agreement and 10 subloans per year in subsequent years (subject to review by the Ministry\nof Finance and Economy, PMU, BOM, and ADB); and (ii) have no more than 10 percent of the\nits SCU portfolio under the credit line in nonperforming loans. Nonperforming loans are defined\nas those loans that are delinquent (i.e., having at least one payment past due for 30 days or", "62\nAppendix 8, page 3\nmore). Delinquency calculations include the entire outstanding balance of a nonperforming loan\nnot only late payments.\n5. If a PFI is found not to be in compliance with the initial and ongoing eligibility criteria, the\nPMU and BOM, with the prior approval of ADB, will determine whether the PFI concerned will (i)\nprepare and implement a plan of action with the objective of reaching compliance, or (ii) will be\nexcluded from the project credit line. Any PFI that is not in compliance for more than one quarter\nwill be automatically excluded from the Project.

Introduction\n1.  Financial analysis has been performed for the credit union service organization (CUSO)\non the basis of its operations as a provider of services to promote and train savings and credit\nunions (SCUs) to support participating financial institutions (PFIs) in the delivery of credit to\nSCUs. Financial analysis has also been undertaken for illustrative aimag and soum SCUs\nbased upon five-year projections of savings and credit activities. A summary of the analyses is\npresented  below.  Detailed  analysis  and  supporting  financial  statements  and  ratios  are\npresented in Supplementary Appendix D.\nB.  Analysis of the CUSO\n2.  The CUSO is assumed to undertake SCU promotion and training and the provision of\ncredit analysis services to the PFIs that onlend the Project\u2019s credit line to the SCUs. The cost of\npromotion and training will be paid from the training fund that the Ministry of Finance and\nEconomy (MOFE) will establish with funds from the charge that will be included in the interest\nthat it earns from relending the project credit line to the PFIs. Costs and revenue from promotion\nand training have not been built into the analysis. Credit analysis services will be paid out of the\ninterest spread earned by the PFIs from onlending the project credit line to the SCUs. Indicative\ninterest rates used are 10 to 12 percent relending rate from MOFE to the PFIs and 24 percent\nonlending rate to the SCUs. For the purpose of the analysis, based on joint discussions with the\nCUSO and PFIs during project appraisal, the CUSO is assumed to earn the equivalent of 5\npercent of the interest spread that the PFIs will earn. The CUSO is expected to qualify in its own\nright to operate as a PFI, in which case it will earn the full spread from onlending the credit line.\nFor the analysis, the CUSO is assumed to commence lending in year 2 and will onlend 10\npercent of the portfolio in that year, 20 percent in year 3 and 50 percent from year 4 onward.\nThe CUSO is assumed to borrow credit-line funds at 12 percent interest and onlend to the\nSCUs at 24 percent per year.\n3. The CUSO\u2019s costs comprise initial investment in fixed assets in head office of $12,000.\nAt the aimag level it will operate out of offices to be established by the PMU, and the CUSO will\nnot need to invest in fixed assets for those offices. A rental charge has however been included\nin its operating expenses. Annual operating costs are estimated at $64,000 at the aimag level\nand $28,000 at head office. Of total operating costs, salaries amount to $54,000 (58 percent).\nThe financing of fixed assets and operating costs has been assumed to be in the form of a loan\nfrom MOFE to the CUSO on terms and conditions that reflect the CUSO\u2019s financial status and\nability to meet interest and principal repayments. For the analysis, an interest rate of 10 percent\nis assumed. The total financing requirement in year 1 amounts to $103,000 (including fixed\nassets of $12,000) and in years 2 and 3, $88,000 and $77,000 respectively. By the end of year\n3, borrowing from MOFE amounts to $256,000. From year 4 onward, the CUSO is able to cover\noperating costs from revenues and to reduce its borrowing from MOFE. By the end of year 5,\nthe debt to MOFE has been reduced to $113,000.\n4. The CUSO\u2019s income from providing credit analysis services to the PFIs would be small\nduring the first three years of the Project when the volume of onlending is low due to the small\nnumber of credit unions in pilot aimags that would be eligible to access the credit line during the\npilot phase. As more of the credit line is disbursed, particularly from year 4 when all credit\nunions in Mongolia are able to access its funds, the CUSO\u2019s revenue increases significantly.", "71\nAppendix 13, page 2\nThe CUSO will make a loss in the first three years of operation but as it engages in onlending\nthe credit line, its profitability increase. It achieves both operational and financial sustainability\nfrom year 4 and has a positive net income in year 4 of $68,000, rising to $233,200 in year 5. At\nthe end of year 5, total assets reach $1.8 million, of which the net SCU loan portfolio accounts\nfor $1.7 million after allowance for a loan loss provision of 3.5 percent. Equity at the end of year\n5 stands at $43,000. Summary financial statements are presented in Table A13.\n5. The CUSO\u2019s future growth and its ability to provide services to the SCUs is dependent\nupon its ability to onlend funds from the project line of credit. It is however able to withstand a\nsignificant fall in the spread that it earns on onlending the credit line. Onlending at 20 percent\nwith the cost of funds remaining at 12 percent reduces revenue but it still shows a positive net\nincome from year 4 onward.

Analysis of Savings and Credit Unions\n6. Financial projections have been prepared for illustrative pilot aimag center and soum\nSCUs. Projected financial statements are available in Supplementary Appendix D. Arhangay is\nconsidered to be representative of the four pilot aimags and is used for the illustrative aimag\ncenter SCU. The analysis is based on the assumption that in aimag center SCUs, members will\nmake an average contribution of $50 per year and in soum level SCUs they will contribute $25\nper year. By the end of year 3, an aimag center SCU member will have an average total\ncontribution of $150, and a soum level SCU member $75. In year 1 all existing members (those\nin  SCUs  created  by  the  end  of  2001)  and  new  members  are  assumed  to  make  these\ncontributions. This means that members of existing SCUs will increase their contributions to\nthese average levels. A minimum membership of 25 and a minimum share contribution of $5\nhave also been assumed in accordance with the levels set for participation in and support from\nthe Project. SCU borrowing from the project line of credit will be limited to a ratio of 1:1 against\naggregate member shares. Loans to members are assumed to be three months in accordance\nwith current practice. Interest rates are assumed to decline over the period of the projections.\nNo attempt has been made to optimize asset management in the analyses.\n7. Savings growth is modeled on the experience of Moncord Savings and Credit Union.\nMoncord is the only SCU with sufficient history to provide a trend, and although it is an urban\nSCU, their experience is reasonable given the financial history of Mongolia. In the first three\nyears of operation, savings growth was very slow due to distrust of the newly formed institution\nand lack of excess cash on the part of members. As member trust in Moncord grew and\nmembers began to improve their earnings through businesses started with loans from Moncord,\nthey began to make deposits with the SCU. In Moncord\u2019s third year of operation, savings\nsurpassed shares with total deposit balances climbing to 1.5 times that of total shares, and in\nthe fourth year to two times total shares. CYDAN, another urban SCU, also experienced slow\ngrowth of savings at the beginning but now those members who do save, save at a rate of 30\ntimes their share contribution. Approximately 33 percent of CYDAN\u2019s members are savers. For\nthe purposes of the illustrative analyses, savings have been held at 1.5 times shares in the fifth\nyear on the basis that incomes in rural areas are lower and the consumption need is greater, so\nsavings will take longer to build.\n8. One of the strengths of the existing SCU movement in Mongolia is the trend to hire staff\nas soon as possible. In keeping with this trend the analyses assume that part-time staff will be\nhired when the SCU reaches 25 members and there will be one full time staff per 50 members.\nThis staff ratio further decreases when membership reaches 75 at which time the SCU is\nassumed to purchase its first computer, thereby increasing operational efficiency. This staff ratio\nis supported by the experience at both Moncord and CYDAN. Staff salaries are based on\naverage  public  service  salaries,  that  is  MNT45,000  plus  benefits  at  the  aimag  level  and\nMNT30,000 plus benefits at the soum level. Based on these assumptions, the pilot aimag is\nable to hire staff and rent premises in the first year of the Project. The pilot aimag SCU also\npurchases a computer in the first year. None of the soum level SCUs purchase a computer\nduring the first five years of the Project but generate sufficient resources to do so by year 6.\n9. Covering all training costs for pilot SCUs is a major benefit as this is a significant cost.\nPilot  SCUs  will  only  need  to  provide  upgrading  or  training  for  new  staff  and  board  and\ncommittee members after the pilot phase so this analysis assumes that soum SCUs will only\ntrain one new person per year and aimag SCUs will train two people each year.", "74\nAppendix 13, page 5\n10. Other cash expenses are board and committee expenses, communications, affiliation\nfees payable to the apex, and stationery and supplies. Communications at the aimag center\nSCU are set at $25 per month and at the soum level at $25 per year. Infrastructure to support\nelectronic communication is limited at the soum level, so communication costs include only\npostage. Stationery and supplies are calculated at $1 per year per member. Fees payable to the\napex begin in year 3 at a rate of $0.20 per member. Board expenses are a nominal $5 to $10\nper month based the on the SCU\u2019s ability to pay board expenses. No remuneration for board or\ncommittee members is included at this stage, although the unallocated earnings allow scope to\ncover greater expenses and still build reserves.\n11. Noncash  expenses  include  depreciation  and  loan  loss  allowances.  The  loan  loss\nallowance is set at 5 percent of loans disbursed. Actual experience in Mongolia is less than 1\npercent, but SCUs have maintained very close memberships with very careful prescreening for\nmembership and loan applications. The workshops on establishing SCUs will encourage much\nmore open membership and more risk-taking on loans so losses will inevitably be greater than\nexperienced to date.\n12. Mongolia is currently experiencing downward pressure on lending rates. The ability to\noffer reasonable loan rates, while at the same time being competitive on deposits and paying a\nreasonable dividend, is critical in that investors are very sensitive to receiving a return on their\ninvestment. Members in existing rural SCUs have demonstrated a willingness to pay interest\nrates of up to 10 percent per month on loans provided that they receive comparable dividends.\nThe dividends are often paid out in cash but members are increasingly willing to receive them\nas shares to build the SCUs equity base.\n13. The pilot aimag center SCU is able to offer loans at 33 percent per annum at the outset,\ncompared with current rates of 48 to 60 percent for the Golden Fund for Development and up to\n180 percent for pawnbrokers. By year 3 the pilot aimag center SCU rates are assumed to fall to\n21 percent. The pilot soum SCU starts with a rate of 60 percent before the Project, but this falls\nto 48 percent in year 1 and reduces steadily to 27 percent by year 5.\n14. Similar analysis of illustrative SCUs in nonpilot aimags show the same trend of reducing\ninterest  rates  but  at  a  slower  rate,  particularly  at  the  soum  level,  than  those  SCUs  that\nparticipate in the pilot phase of the Project."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20010929125836", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "ldm", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R159-01rrp-sp.doc", "ModDate": "D:20011030144435+08'00'"}}
