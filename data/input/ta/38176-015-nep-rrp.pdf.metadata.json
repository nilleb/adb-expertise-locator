I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed grant \nto Nepal for the Skills Development Project.1  \n \n2.  The  project  will  help  the  government  implement  key  aspects  of  the  Technical  and \nVocational Education and Training (TVET) Policy, 2012.2 The project will help the government \n(i) initiate strategic reforms that aim to improve overall management and performance of the \nTVET system, (ii) improve the quality and relevance of public training, and (iii) increase private \nsector engagement in training delivery and job placement. Each intervention has been designed \nto increase the efficiency and results orientation of TVET, making it more market-driven. The \nproject will focus on skills development for the construction, manufacturing, and services sectors \nwhere large skill gaps exist.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n  \n3.  Despite a decade of conflict until 2006 followed by protracted political instability, Nepal \nhas made significant progress in key Millennium Development Goals.4 Gross domestic product \n(GDP) grew by less than 5% in FY2008\u2013FY2012.5 The government is at a critical juncture to \nmeet the aspiration of the people for an improved standard of living and more equitable access \nto opportunities. Recent reports identify lack of skilled labor as one of the key constraints for \neconomic growth.6 The economy is undergoing a transition from a largely subsistence, agrarian \neconomy to a more mixed economy where demand for basic to mid-level technically skilled \nworkers is growing rapidly, especially in the services sector.7 Having a base of skilled young \npeople can underpin stronger economic growth, leveraging Nepal\u2019s demographic dividend and \nproductivity gains, provide transformational opportunities to individuals, and thus contribute to \nsocial stability and national development. \n \n4.  Human resource potential. Nepal has great potential for a demographic dividend, with \nan age dependency ratio of 65.9% in 2011, high labor force participation of both women (80.2%) \nand men (87.7%) in 2010, and high overseas demand for Nepalese workers. Unemployment \nrate  was  2.7%.8 Annually,  about  450,000  youth  enter  the  labor  market.  Seeking  better \nemployment opportunities, about 1,000 Nepalese workers leave for jobs abroad on a daily basis \nin 2011.9 Remittances were estimated to be about 21% of GDP in 2012. The educational \nattainment of the workforce, however, is poor as 62% leave school by grade 5, over 75% by \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The policy formulation was facilitated by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Skills for Employment Project, which \nwas completed in 2012. ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: \nProposed Loan to the Kingdom of Nepal for the Skills for Employment Project. Manila. \n3  ADB provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Preparing \nthe Skills Development Project. Manila. \n4  The poverty headcount ratio (national poverty line) declined from 42% in 1996 to 25% in 2011 (World Bank), the \nnet enrollment rate in primary education increased from 57% (FY1996) to 94% (FY2010), gender parity was \nachieved in primary education (Ministry of Education), and infant mortality rate was reduced from 162 per \n1,000 live births in 1990 to 50 in 2011 (World Health Organization).  \n5  The World Bank. http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ \n6  Government of Nepal, Ministry of Finance. 2012. Economic Survey FY2011\u20132012. Kathmandu.  \n7  The contribution of agriculture to gross domestic product (GDP) has decreased from 70% in 1980 to 35% in 2012. \nAgriculture still employed 74% of the labor force in 2012, but the majority was in the informal sector and \nunderemployed. Industry contributed 15% of GDP and services 50% (footnote 6). \n8  Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission. 2009. Labor Force Survey 2008. Kathmandu.  \n9  Department of Foreign Employment. http://www.dofe.gov.np/ ", "2 \ngrade 8, and about 48% never attended school (footnote 8). Overseas workers are mainly \nengaged in low- or no-skilled and low-wage occupations. Nepal experiences skills mismatch in \nthe labor market where job seekers do not have the right skills for available vacancies and new \nskills  are  in  demand.  Domestic  employers  report  shortages  of  workers  with  technical  and \ngeneral employability skills.  \n \n5.  Technical and vocational education and training. Formal TVET in Nepal is offered \nthrough 26 public institutes, 75 vocational units attached to district secondary schools, and over \n450 privately run, publicly affiliated training providers. Many small unaffiliated providers offer \ninformal training, and traditional apprenticeships offer informal learning on the job. Constituted in \n1989,  the  Council  for  Technical  Education  and  Vocational  Training  (CTEVT)  has  been \nmandated to be an autonomous apex body for TVET, and forms the backbone of the formal \nTVET system in Nepal in terms of technical, regulatory, and provision functions through its \nconstituent institutions and affiliated providers. As semiautonomous suborganizations of the \nCTEVT, the Training Institute for Technical Instruction and the National Skills Testing Board \nserve the need for TVET human resource development, skills testing, and certification. Several \ngovernment ministries also run formal and informal programs. The number of private training \nproviders has increased since the mid-2000s due to high demand for skills with an expectation \nof  higher-paying  jobs.  Government  and  externally  financed  projects  also  offer  short-term \ntraining.10  \n \n6.  Constraints. TVET has an important role in transforming Nepal\u2019s human resources into \nproductive  assets  to  meet  the  government\u2019s  national  development  objective  for  inclusive, \nemployment-oriented growth. Key constraints to TVET sector performance include the following: \n(i)   Insufficient  and inequitable  access. The formal TVET system offers about \n26,000 places at technical school leaving certificate and diploma levels.11 Various \norganizations, both private and public, offer about 60,000 places in short-term \ntraining opportunities per year.12 Considering the large number of new entrants, \nthe current level of access is far from adequate. In addition, opportunities are \nconcentrated in urban areas and women and people from excluded groups still \nface  difficulties  in  access  because  of  the  additional  cost,  opportunity  cost, \ndistance, prerequisites, and male-oriented training setup.13 Gender tracking, i.e., \na pattern that reinforces male\u2013female distinctions in occupational and income \ndisparities, is evident in TVET as female enrollment is much higher in traditionally \nfemale skills like housekeeping and care giving.  \n(ii)   Poor quality and low market relevance. A persistent lack of investment in \nTVET has resulted in insufficient and outdated equipment, facilities, materials, \nand teaching force in the public sector. In the private sector, few providers are \nable  to  invest  adequately  in  their  facilities  or  scale  up  their  teaching  force \nbecause  of  unpredictable  business  opportunities  and  price  competition.  The \nindustry relevance of TVET is low and industry involvement in TVET is weak\u2014\nundermining  the  credibility  of  TVET  qualifications.  There  are  no  formalized \nindustry  sector  councils  at  the  national  level,  nor  many  direct  advisory \n                                                \n10  Such  informal  training  opportunities  have  a  range  of  different  objectives,  e.g.,  poverty  alleviation,  social \ndevelopment, peace building, gender mainstreaming, rural development, and private sector development. Short-\nterm training covers wide range of basic skills in agriculture, construction, tourism, crafts, and services.   \n11  Technical school leaving certificate and diploma programs are 18\u201330 months technical education, with a 50% \nrequirement for practical training, aiming at developing mid-level skilled technicians.  \n12 ADB. 2012. Nepal Country Report on TVET. Consultant\u2019s Report. Manila (RETA-6337). \n13 Following the government\u2019s definition, excluded groups refer to those that have experienced exclusion historically \nand have not been mainstreamed in the nation\u2019s development, e.g., women, Dalits, Adivasi Janajatis, Madhesis, \nMuslims, people living with disabilities, and people of geographically remote areas. \n ", "3 \ncommittees  at  provider  level.  Public  training  providers  often  have  limited \nunderstanding of the requirements of the modern labor market; courses are not \nupdated to reflect the needs of employers; and few providers offer adequate \npost-training support to assist trainees\u2019 transition to the labor market.  \n(iii)   Weak institutional capacity. The government adopted its TVET policy in 2012, \nsignaling a strong commitment and vision for TVET, but the policy framework is \nnot  linked  to  national  development  planning  processes,  there  is  no  clear \nimplementation  strategy,  and  the  Ministry  of  Education  (MOE)  has  limited \ncapacity in TVET. TVET efforts are fragmented, without effective coordination. \nThe  CTEVT\u2019s  structure,  functions,  and  organizational  and  human  resource \ncapacity remain largely the same as when it was established in 1989. It has both \nregulatory and provision functions, which creates a perceived conflict of interest. \nPublic providers lack autonomy in financial and human resource decisions, which \nacts as a disincentive to innovation and entrepreneurship. The number of private \ntraining providers has recently increased with externally funded projects, but their \ncapacity to develop viable business by providing quality and market-relevant \ntraining is limited.  \n \n7.  Investment  gaps.  The  government  allocated  about  $20  million  for  public  TVET \nprovision in FY2012 through various ministries. Since FY2008, the government allocation has \nincreased by 30% annually, mostly spent on recurrent expenditures (i.e., staff salaries), leaving \nlittle for upgrading or new investment in infrastructure and human resources. Recent estimates \nproject  the  annual  financing  requirement  for  73,000  students  (5%  of  general  secondary \nenrollment) in the technical stream and 200,000 places for basic training to be more than \n$110 million by 2016.14 This is based on the government unit costs for different programs, which \nexclude capital investment, so the actual needs for TVET financing would be even larger.  \n \n8.  Opportunities. The TVET policy envisions critical institutional reforms such as a single-\nwindow TVET fund, a national vocational qualification framework, and a national vocational \nqualification authority. The current political environment and existing institutional capacity are \nnot conducive for comprehensive reforms or a large-scale investment to realize the vision. \nHowever, the CTEVT Act, 1988 is flexible enough to commence key institutional and operational \nreforms  without  regulatory  changes.  The  CTEVT  and  public  and  private  providers  have \nestablished a base of infrastructure and human resources where catalytic investment can help \nmaximize  the  utilization  for  better  efficiency.  These  aspects  offer  ample  opportunities  to \n(i) institute incremental reform that will contribute to more coherent sector coordination; and \n(ii) create an environment for a vibrant mix of public and private providers to apply innovative \napproaches to address access, quality, and relevance issues. As the first externally funded \nproject after the TVET Policy was adopted in 2012, the project will leverage these opportunities, \naiming at incremental reform and instilling the focus on performance and employment results. \nInformed by a labor market assessment, the project will focus on construction, manufacturing, \nand services where high demand for basic and mid-level skills exists.15  \n  \n9.  Development coordination. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) Skills for Employment \nProject initiated market-oriented, short-term training using performance-based contracting of \nprivate providers, achieving the target of 60,000 trainees over a 5-year period (footnote 2). The \nSkills for Employment Project mechanism has been adapted by other projects such as the \nEmployment Fund (financed by the Department for International Development of the United \n                                                \n14  Ministry of Education, Government of Nepal. 2012. Resource Need Assessment for TVET Sub-Sector in Nepal. \nUnpublished consultant report funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation.  \n15  Labor Market Assessment of Demand for Skills (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "4 \nKingdom, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, and the World Bank) and the \nEnhanced Vocational Education and Training (financed by the World Bank). Both projects use \nsimilar performance-based contracting, each delivering about 10,000\u201315,000 places annually. \nThe  project  will  augment  these  efforts  in  expanding  access  to  basic  skills  training.  The \nEmployment  Fund,  which  has  been  successfully  implemented  outside  of  the  government \nsystem, will end in 2013 and the Employment Fund is exploring ways to transfer its good \npractices to the government system. The project will build the capacity of the CTEVT in adapting \nand applying good practices, such as performance-based contracting and rigorous monitoring. \nFor the last decade, development partners have not supported the CTEVT\u2019s core organizational \nissues because of its politicization, and the proposed incremental reform will provide an entry \npoint for development partners to jointly support a more comprehensive reform in the near \nfuture. \n \n10.  Lessons. Lessons from the Skills for Employment Project and other projects are (i) that \ntraining needs assessments focusing on market-driven skills, identification of the right trainees, \nand post-training services are required to ensure better employment outcome and inclusiveness \ntargets; (ii) that rigorous monitoring is essential to ensure quality training and minimize fiduciary \nrisks; (iii) that TVET agencies need to build operational capacity; (iv) that industry linkages \nshould be enhanced at the training provider level; and (v) that CTEVT constituent institutions \nshould be granted greater autonomy for quality and relevance improvement.  \n \n11.  Key design features. Building on the lessons and leveraging existing opportunities, the \nproject  will  adopt  the  following  design  features,  which  aim  at  instilling  strong  results  and \nperformance orientation in TVET: \n \n(i)  Whole-cycle approach to skills development. The project will institutionalize \nskills development initiatives to include (a) identification of skills demanded, (b) \nmobilization of potential trainees, (c) training provision itself, and (d) employment \nservices.  \n(ii)  Private  sector  engagement.  The  project  will  use  performance-based \ncontracting  to  engage  private  training  providers  to  deliver  training  and \nemployment  services.  Both  private  and  public  providers  will  be  required  to \ninvolve  employers  and  industry  representatives,  both  at  the  institutional  and \nindividual school levels, strengthening links to the job market.  \n(iii)  Gender and social inclusion. The project will aim at increasing the enrollment \nand employment of women and people from excluded groups in nontraditional \nskills by giving the training providers higher payment for training and finding \nemployment for women and people from excluded groups.  \n(iv)  Monitoring and evaluation and fiduciary management. A strong monitoring \nand evaluation (M&E) mechanism, which includes third-party monitoring to verify \nemployment outcomes, will reduce the fiduciary risks involved in performance-\nbased contracts. An annual fiduciary review will complement the internal audit of \nthe CTEVT and the financial audit by the government\u2019s Office of the Auditor \nGeneral.  \n \n12.  The project is fully aligned with the Three Year Plan, FY2011\u2013FY2013, which highlights \nthe need for more skills training for employment. The project contributes directly to two pillars: (i) \nbroad-based and inclusive economic growth and (ii) inclusive social development in ADB\u2019s \ncountry  partnership  strategy,  2010\u20132012,  and  will  contribute  to  effective  implementation, \n ", "5 \noperation, and maintenance of ADB investments in energy, transport, and urban infrastructure \ndevelopment by increasing the skilled labor force.16  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The impact will be increased employability of the Nepalese workforce. The outcome will \nbe the establishment of a market-responsive and social and gender-inclusive TVET system.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  Output 1: Expanded provision of inclusive, market-oriented training. Output 1 will \nprovide  45,000  additional  places  for  market-oriented,  basic  skills  training.17 It  will  target \nunemployed or underemployed people, at least 40% of whom will be women and 30% from \nexcluded groups. An additional 1,000 places for mid-level skills programs will be created at the \n10  selected  public  providers.  Output  1  will  be  achieved  by  (i)  conducting  awareness  and \nsocialization  campaigns for  potential  trainees; (ii)  engaging  private  and  public  providers  to \ndeliver training and employment services; (iii) using a results-based payment methodology \nwhereby milestone payments are released only upon verification of employment outcomes; and \n(iv) monitoring and evaluating training activities.  \n \n15.  Output 1 aims to close the skills gap by providing basic or mid-level skills for people with \nlow  formal  educational  attainment  and  limited  work  experience,  who  will  usually  be  from \ndisadvantaged backgrounds. Social mobilization and community outreach will be used to reach \nthe target group. About 36,000 seats will be delivered by private training providers and this \nmodality will further develop government capacity to manage performance-based contracting. \nHigher performance payments will be given for training and job placement for women and \npeople  from  excluded  groups.  By  tying  50%  of  the  contract  payment  with  employment \noutcomes, this output will encourage private providers to focus more on employment results and \nto  scale  up  their  operations\u2014increasing  their  chances  for  growing  viable  business.  About \n9,000 places will be delivered by public training providers, through a separate mechanism, also \nadopting whole-cycle approach and focusing on employment outcomes. \n \n16.  Output 2: Improved quality and relevance of technical and vocational education \nand  training  provision.  Output  2  will  improve  the  quality  and  relevance  of  TVET  by \ntransforming  10  public  providers  into  more  efficient,  better  managed,  market-driven  model \ninstitutes  with  close  links  to  labor  market  demand.  It  will  (i)  implement  a  comprehensive, \ntailored, quality improvement program in 10 selected public training institutions, turning them \ninto model TVET institutes; (ii) develop 25 new or updated fee-paying mid-level programs in the \npriority sectors of construction, manufacturing, and services to be delivered in the 10 model \ninstitutes;  (iii)  support refurbishment  and  equipment  purchase  necessary  to  support quality \ntraining; (iv) establish industry partnership committees and agreements for industry linkages at \nthe 10 model institutes; and (v) provide in-service training for 300 TVET professionals in TVET \nmanagement, occupational skills, instructional skills, and curriculum development.  \n \n17.  The 10 public training institutions have been selected based on geographic spread, non-\noverlapping support with the World Bank project, possibility of increasing enrollment utilizing \nexisting facilities, and strong management potential. Considering the diverse socioeconomic \ncharacteristics of each region and changing labor market demand, good management capacity \nand increased autonomy at training institute level is crucial to perform better. CTEVT has \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Nepal, 2010\u20132012. Manila. \n17 Basic training will be for 3 months, including on-the-job training. \n ", "6 \nagreed to allow greater autonomy for the 10 selected providers, including the retention and use \nof a greater percentage of income earned. With targeted management training, institute-specific \nquality improvement plans, and the establishment of direct industry and employer links, the 10 \nmodel institutes are expected to develop into more autonomous and entrepreneurial training \ninstitutes  serving  local  and  industry  needs  and  managing  resources  more  efficiently.  The \nperformance of these selected institutes will be gauged against set quality criteria, baselines \nestablished  at  the  onset  of  the  project,  and  targets  included  in  the  quality  improvement \nprograms. In the future, the quality criteria may be developed and form the basis of a stronger \naffiliation  and  registration  system.  Priority  for  the  300  in-service  professional  development \nopportunities will be given to staff within the 10 model institutes and the CTEVT. \n \n18.  Output 3: Policy, institutional, and operational reforms implemented. Output 3 will \ncontribute to more effective management of TVET by (i) ensuring the TVET road map and \nresults framework are updated and in line with national development priorities; (ii) setting up a \nTVET sector development unit (TSDU) within the MOE, which will be responsible for overall \ncoordination;  (iii)  preparing  the  institutional  framework,  procedures,  and  detailed  terms  of \nreference of a single-window TVET fund; and (iv) facilitating the CTEVT to restructure in line \nwith emerging labor market demand and services.  \n \n19.  The TVET Policy lays out the government\u2019s vision for TVET with the understanding that \na number of policy, institutional, and operational reforms are necessary. TVET systems are \ndiversifying into training markets with a mix of public, private, industry, or community-managed \nproviders. This calls for a changing role of government agencies. The government should take \nthe role of facilitator and regulator, allowing equal opportunities for both public and private \nproviders, encouraging more private sector investment in training, and filling any gaps through \npublic investment or public\u2013private partnerships. To support such transformation, this output will \nhelp redefine the roles and strengthen the capacity of the MOE and CTEVT for improved TVET \nmanagement. The output will establish a TSDU within the MOE. The unit will be responsible for \noverall  coordination,  using  the  sector  road  map  and  results  framework  as  the  tools  for \ncoordinated  planning,  implementation,  and  M&E.  It  will  also  take  the  lead  to  develop  the \ninstitutional framework and procedures of a TVET fund as envisaged by the TVET Policy. The \ngovernment will make an annual allocation of $2 million from FY2016 to be disbursed via the \nTVET fund mechanism. Together with the results framework, the TVET fund will help the \ngovernment to introduce a sector-wide approach.  \n \n20.  Output 4: Effective project management, monitoring, and evaluation. Output 4 will \nprovide the support necessary for effective project management and robust M&E of results. This \nwill be achieved by enabling the project coordination unit and project implementation unit to \n(i) operate a robust M&E mechanism\u2014including establishing five regional M&E teams, a third-\nparty monitoring mechanism for employment verification, and an M&E database; (ii) ensure \ntimely  planning,  implementation,  and  reporting;  and  (iii)  adhere  to  and  implement  sound \nfiduciary and financial management systems.  \n \n21.  The project implementation will be in line with the existing institutional setup involving the \nMOE and CTEVT, strengthening their respective roles in TVET management. The MOE will be \nresponsible for activities related to the sector road map and results framework, TVET fund \nmechanism, and TSDU establishment. The CTEVT will implement the rest of the activities by \nbuilding on the capacity and experience gained during the Skills for Employment Project. The \nproject will apply strong and close monitoring of results. It will establish regional M&E teams to \nensure access to all providers.

Implementation Arrangements  \n \n24.  The MOE will be the executing agency. A project steering committee will be established \nto oversee the implementation and provide interministerial coordination. The CTEVT will be the \nimplementing agency. A TSDU will be established under the MOE and a project implementation \nunit under the CTEVT. Implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described \nin detail in the project administration manual. \n \n25.  All works, goods, and consulting services for project implementation will be procured in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time) and \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). As part of advance \ncontracting to avoid initial implementation delays, the government requested ADB assistance in \n                                                \n18  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 ADB grant proceeds may finance transportation, insurance, recurrent costs, and bank charges. \n ", "8 \nthe procurement of the project implementation and technical support services contract up to \nfinal  ranking,  leaving  contract  negotiation  and  signing  to  the  implementing  agency.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  The project\u2019s economic benefits would come mainly from the higher wages that skilled \nworkers can earn compared with unskilled workers. Other benefits, such as the multiplier effect \nfrom the increased income level of trained workers and overall productivity increase in the \neconomy are not included in the incremental benefits. The cumulative net incremental benefits \nbecome positive within 5 years of implementation. The project\u2019s economic internal rate of return \nis estimated at 35% and remains well above 12% in different scenarios.20 This high economic \ninternal rate of return reflects the shortage of skilled workers in Nepal. \n \n27.  The financial analysis assessed the sustainability of the project at national and project \nlevels, and evaluated the impact of the proposed investment given current and projected TVET \nfunding levels.21 The analysis concluded that the government has the capacity to absorb and \nsustain the benefits of the project considering the increasing budget allocation for TVET, the \nefficiency gains from better utilization of existing facility and upgraded human resources, and \nexpansion of fee-based training programs. For short-term training, however, the government will \nneed to allocate additional financing to continue providing the target population with access to \nskills development opportunities and employment.  \n                                                \n20 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21 Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nB.  Governance  \n \n28.  Project-specific governance risks have been identified through financial management \nand procurement capacity assessments of the MOE and CTEVT in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nFinancial Management and Analysis of Projects and Financial Due Diligence: A Methodology \nNote.22 The assessments were informed by implementation of the Skills for Employment Project \nas  well  as  sector  and  country  governance  risk  assessments.  The  assessments  identified \nweaknesses in (i) compliance with rules and procedures; (ii) staff capacity in accounting and \ninternal  audit;  and  (iii)  financial  reporting,  oversight,  and  accountability.  To  address  the \nweaknesses,  the  project  will  train  the  project  staff  in  government  and  ADB  financial  and \nprocurement  rules,  and  provide  detailed  statement  of  audit  needs  for  audited  financial \nstatements to be better aligned with international accounting and auditing standards. A third \nparty will conduct annual fiduciary reviews, which include risk update and post-procurement \naudit  to  help  identify  and  improve  government  capacity  to  manage  associated  risks.  The \nindependent monitoring of training provision and verification of employment will not only provide \ncomfort on the outputs achieved, but also indirectly on the uses of funds.  \n \n29.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the project administration manual. \n  \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  Despite the recent progress in poverty reduction, more than 25% of people live under \nthe national poverty line, and disparities in income and non-income poverty persist between \nmen and women; urban and rural areas; and across different social, ethnic, and religious \ngroups. The poverty is highly correlated with low human resource levels in areas such as \nliteracy,  education,  and  productive  skills.  A  gender  and  social  inclusion  analysis  of  TVET \nconcludes that women and people from excluded groups face obstacles in accessing skills \ndevelopment opportunities because of multifaceted barriers.23 Employment-linked skills training \nin occupations in high demand will allow unemployed and underemployed target beneficiaries to \nfind gainful employment, thus contributing to poverty reduction and social empowerment. The \nproject design incorporates measures to increase women\u2019s and excluded groups\u2019 enrollment in \nnontraditional  skills  training  and  their  employment  in  the  construction,  manufacturing,  and \nservices sectors, through social marketing and mobilization, outreach, pre- and post-training \nservices (counseling and employment services), and affirmative action such as scholarships \nand quota. Higher performance payments will be given to training providers for training and job \nplacement of women and people from excluded groups. A gender equality and social inclusion \naction plan is developed to guide project implementation and M&E.24  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n31.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \nunder category C for impacts on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples. Only minor civil works will be carried out for refurbishment of existing buildings and \n                                                \n22 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.

Manila. \n23  These include costs and availability of training, lack of basic education impeding entry qualifications, lack of \ninformation on opportunities, limited mobility, lack of enabling environment and learning facilities, cultural norms \nand values, poorly aligned and executed training programs, weak affirmative measures, and discrimination in \nemployment opportunities and practices. \n24  Gender Equality and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nfacilities within the selected institutions\u2019 premise. Any work that attracts safeguard category A or \nB under the Safeguard Policy Statement will not be implemented under the project.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in the risk \nassessment and risk management plan.25 The project will ensure ongoing review of the risk \nmitigation plan during project implementation.  \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInternal resistance within CTEVT may  Restructuring plan will be prepared in wide consultation within \ninterfere with CTEVT restructuring  CTEVT, facilitated by reform-minded directors, and a change \nmanagement strategy will be developed and implemented by \nCTEVT management, with the support of MOE and other key \nstakeholders. \nAbsorption capacity of the private  International training providers will be allowed to participate in \ntraining providers is limited as the  the knowledge transfer and capacity building of local providers. \nmajority of them are small and  The request for proposal and contract will require a clear \ninexperienced in joint ventures  delineation of responsibilities among joint venture partners.   \nResults-based payments may lead to  Independent monitoring of training provision and verification of \nfraudulent reporting by training provider  employment will be conducted by the regional monitoring team \non trainees and employment status  as well as a third-party monitoring firm. \nHigh turnover of staff may disrupt  MOE and CTEVT will ensure continuity in staff assignment, and \nproject implementation  good staff performance in project management will be reflected \nin the existing staff appraisal scheme.   \nCTEVT = Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training, MOE = Ministry of Education. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n33.  The government and CTEVT have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and grant documents. The government and CTEVT have \nagreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the grant agreement \nand project agreement. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.
