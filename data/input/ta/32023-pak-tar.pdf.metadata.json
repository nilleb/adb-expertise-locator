Improving governance has emerged in recent years as one of the key development\npriorities in Pakistan. Judicial and legal reforms are a central item in the country's development\nagenda as confirmed by the Bank-funded technical assistance (TA), Pakistan 2010 Long-Term\nPerspective Study.1 The study noted that both foreign and domestic investment in Pakistan will\ncontinue to be of a short-term \"quick-take\" nature unless the federal and provincial governments\ncommit financial and human resources to rebuilding judicial systems and enhancing the\nprofessional capability of judicial personnel, and then commit political capital to supporting\nadherence to the rule of law.\n2. To address this critical issue, the Ministry of Law, Justice, and Human Rights (MOL)\nprepared a preliminary paper in 1997, Pakistan 2000: Reforming the Judicial System, and asked\nthe Bank to help identify a reform agenda for the sector. The Bank responded by approving two\nlAs: Strengthening Government Legal Services and the Subordinate Judiciary in December\n1997, and Legal and Judicial Reform in May 1998.2 Learning from the experience of earlier aid-\nassisted reform projects,3 the TAs were carried out with significant inputs from domestic\nconsultants and extensive stakeholder participation. Stakeholder participation has involved the\njudiciary, the legal profession, and members of the public as represented by various\nnongovernment organizations including womens' groups, journalists, civil servants, academics,\nand journalists.\n3. On the basis of reports prepared under the TAs, the Government and the Bank entered\ninto a dialogue to define a comprehensive judicial and legal reform program that is expected to\nbe the subject of a policy-based operation by the Bank in 2000. As an important preparatory\nstep, the Government asked the Bank to provide advisory TA to strengthen institutional capacity\nfor judicial and legal reform. The TA is included in the 1999 country program 4 and fact-finding\nwas carried out in June 1999. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n4. Prior to British rule, Pakistan had an indigenous legal system based on Islamic and\ntraditional law. Imposed upon this was a common law system that generally accommodated\npersonal laws (i.e., laws relating to marriage and inheritance) of different religious groups.\nHowever, the laws and legal institutions introduced during the British regime were generally\nthose suited for rule by the colonial power. Since the creation of modern Pakistan, the legal and\njudicial system has been adapted on an ad hoc basis to suit the needs of martial law and, more\nrecently, an evolving democratic system. During the 1980s there was a revival of Islamic law,\nand the Federal Shariat Court examined most laws for their compliance with Islamic law. Apart\nfrom laws relating to interest,5 the Court has judged almost all laws as being consistent with\nIslamic law.\n1 TA 2647-PAK: Pakistan 2010 Long-Term Perspective Study, for $1,140,000, approved on 24 September 1996.\n2 TA 2979-PAK: Strengthening Government Legal Services and the Subordinate Judiciary,  for $150,000, approved on\n31 December 1997; and TA 3015-PAK: Legal and Judicial Reform Project, for $995,000, approved on 7 May 1998.\nPrimarily, the experience of the World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development,\nparticularly in Latin America and Eastern Europe, where there has been more extensive judicial and legal reform\nthan in Asia.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in July 1999 (Internet edition).\nAn appeal of the Federal Shariat Court's judgement banning interest is currently being considered by the Appellate\nShariat Bench of the Supreme Court.", "2\n5. At the top of Pakistan's court system is the Supreme Court of Pakistan, the apex court,\nfollowed by a high court in each province, i.e., the apex provincial court. Together with the\nFederal Shariat Court (which hears appeals against Islamic criminal law matters and decides on\nwhether any law is in conformity or nonconformity with Islamic law), these courts comprise the\nsuperior courts. Below each high court are the district courts; the civil courts are below each\ndistrict court. Precedents of the Supreme Court are binding on all courts in Pakistan.\nAdministratively, the Supreme Court falls under the federation in terms of direct budgetary\nsupport, whereas all other courts fall under the provincial governments. Procedures in courts\nand their organization are, however, generally uniform throughout Pakistan. In addition to these\nregular courts, there are a large number of tribunals and specialized courts. Most significant\namong these are the special courts to decide cases of terrorist acts and major crimes, and the\nbanking tribunals. Labor courts and the National Industrial Relations Commission exercise\nexclusive jurisdiction over labor and industrial relations disputes with appeals being heard in the\nsuperior courts. Similarly the provincial and federal service tribunals deal with all disputes\nbetween civil servants and the government with appeals being heard by the Supreme Court.\nThe court structure is set out in Appendix 2.\n6. Appointment procedures for judges of the superior courts are contained in the\nConstitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The chief justice is appointed by the\nPresident, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, while other judges of the Supreme Court\nare appointed by the President after consultation with the chief justice.6 In appointing the chief\njustice of a high court, the President is required to consult the chief justice of Pakistan and the\ngovernor of the province concerned who acts on the advice of the chief minister of the province.\nIn the case of other judges of a high court, the President is also required to consult the chief\njustice of the high court concerned.7 Until 1997, the appointment of judges for the superior\ncourts was tainted by political favoritism as the President was not required to explain why the\nadvice of the chief justice of Pakistan or of a chief justice of a high court had not been followed.\nHowever, in 1997 the Supreme Court decided that the views of the chief justice of Pakistan and\nthe chief justice of a high court should be followed in the appointment process. The Supreme\nCourt also laid down that the most senior judges should be appointed as chief justices. While\nthe political nature of judicial appointments is still the subject of debate, the outgoing chief\njustice in 1999 assured the bar that all appointments during his tenure were made on merit, the\nviews of the judiciary were fully taken into account, and that the seniority rule in appointment of\nchief justices was also observed. Appointment of subordinate judges is carried out by each of\nthe provincial high courts. However, the system for selection is not institutionalized and varies\nfrom province to province.\n7. Empirical research under the legal and judicial reform TA (footnote 2) confirmed that\ncourt delays are very serious and disruptive. Apart from delay, the high costs of litigation and\nlack of faith in the system are major barriers to accessing justice through the courts, especially\nin the subordinate courts. Significantly, survey results show that while the subordinate courts\nare not as highly regarded as some other public institutions (e.g., public hospitals or schools),\nthey have a better public image than some other public entities (e.g., the police) and remain a\nshield for society against injustice. While the court system may have its severe shortcomings, it\nhas the potential for reform, and it is in the public interest that these reforms be urgently\nundertaken. These TA projects analyzed the major issues confronting the sector, and proposed\nphased solutions incorporating extensive and multitiered stakeholder participation. The TAs also\ncollected and analyzed, for the first time in Pakistan, empirical data relating to budgetary\n6 \nArticle 177 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.\nArticle 193 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973.", "[C]\nallocations of judicial administration, amounts collected in court fees and fines, delays in courts,\nand user perceptions.\n8. While successive Governments have changed some substantive laws, very little has\nbeen done to address systemic problems or to increase efficiency. At least eight law reform\ncommissions have been constituted since 1958 to review the administration of justice in\nPakistan and provide recommendations on legal and judicial reform.8 The last commission, the\nCommission on the Reform of Civil Law of 1993, blamed successive governments for their lack\nof concern and their failure to provide resources to improve the administration of justice. The\nfollowing major problems exist.\n9. Weak Governance and Administration. There is no centralized coordinating body for\ndeveloping legal and judicial policy, and no system for collecting and analyzing empirical data to\nevaluate the performance of the system or to recommend reforms. Establishment of a national\njudicial policy-making body has, therefore, been identified as a key reform measure, together\nwith a modern system for judicial statistics and institutionalizing the publication of annual high\ncourt reports.\n10. Long Delays. Case management and delay, as a general matter, is a chronic problem.\nWhile the measurement of its consequences is difficult, the dysfunctionality of the courts is\ncostly to Pakistan's economy. Inflation creates incentives to delay because there is no statutory\nadjustment for inflation when a final settlement is reached. The causes of delay are many.9\nHowever, greater use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) procedures combined with better\ncase management have elsewhere proven to be effective means to reduce delays. Delay\nreduction initiatives incorporating ADR and the latest case management techniques, informed\nby local inputs, need to be pilot tested to find a solution to the problem of delay.\n11. Lack of Professional Management. There are no professional managers in the courts\nto handle budgeting, personnel, technology, or case and court management. Record-keeping\nsystems are inadequate and outdated. Introduction of modern management systems, including\ngreater use of information technology in courts, and the establishment of oversight institutions\nsuch as the judicial ombudsman (JO) are vital to begin the process of reform.\n12. Lack of Client Focus. The judicial system is insensitive to the needs of the public.\nSystems to promote greater access to information for litigants are therefore vital. Sensitivity to\nthe public is also required in the design of new court buildings, e.g., public waiting areas,\nfacilities for women, and information services. As first steps toward a greater customer focus,\nthe establishment of the JO, publication of annual reports by the superior courts, and pilot\ntesting of public information booths need to be carried out together with adoption of new\nstandards for court buildings.\n13. Lack of Budget Resources. International standards indicate at least 15-20 percent of\nthe judicial budget is necessary to cover essential nonsalary inputs. Yet, at the civil court level,\nwhere there is the greatest need for nonsalary inputs, the nonsalary percentage of the budget\n8 The eight law reform commissions are (I) Law Reform Commission of 1958, (ii) Law Reform Commission of (1967-\n1970), (iii) Law Reform Committee of 1974 (otherwise known as the Hamood-ur-Rahman Commission), (iv) Law\nReform Committee for Recommending Measures for Speedy Disposal of Civil Litigation of 1978, (v) Secretaries'\nCommittee of 1979, (vi) Salahuddin Ahmed Committee of 1980, (vii) Committee on the Islamization of Laws and\nEstablishment of Qazi Courts of 1980, and (viii) Commission on the Reform of Civil Law of 1993. Other committees\non penal law and the law related to women have published reports since 1993.\nSuch as inadequate and/or incompetent judges, dilatory tactics by the bar and nonobservance of the civil\nprocedure code. Experience from Sri Lanka has shown the benefits of effective ADR in reducing court congestion.", "4\nranges from a mere 2 percent in Sindh, to 4 percent in Baluchistan, 7 percent in North-West\nFrontier Province, and 8 percent in Punjab. Nonsalary inputs have declined as a percentage of\nthe budget over the past 10 years. Since 1993/94, the annual budget for the administration and\ndelivery of justice has been reduced in real terms. Currently, the annual recurrent expenditure\non justice administration is one of the lowest in the world, ranging from less than 0.5 percent of\nthe total annual recurrent expenditure of the provincial governments (Baluchistan and North-\nWest Frontier Province to approximately 0.75 percent (Punjab and Sindh), 1\u00b0 and total less than\n0.1 percent of the federal Government budget for recurrent expenditure. Gradually raising the\nallocation of annual recurrent expenditure for the administration of justice with an increased\npercentage for nonsalary expenditures will therefore be an important indication of the\nGovernment's commitment to reform. This is considered to be an essential part of any strategy\nto attract quality candidates from the bar, and is especially important at the subordinate court\nlevel where incentive packages are poor. As it may not be sustainable in the short term to raise\nthe budgetary allocations to the required percentage, a dedicated judicial development fund is\nproposed to be established for development purposes; it could be augmented with resources\nthat the judiciary can utilize, e.g., fines for frivolous adjournments and increased court fees.11\n14. Shortage of Judges. In addition to a lack of financial resources, the judiciary is also\nseverely understaffed. The judge to population ratio is exceedingly low (Appendix 2). Human\nresource constraints are exacerbated by inadequate incentive packages, difficult working\nconditions, and inadequate performance standards. Filling of judicial vacancies and the creation\nof new positions need to be addressed. Most importantly, the quality of human resources needs\nto be improved through better legal education, institutionalized preservice and in-service\ntraining, improved incentive packages, and improved performance standards.\n15. Inadequate Infrastructure. The court infrastructure is a serious impediment to the\neffective administration of justice. The physical infrastructure of the subordinate courts suffers\nfrom years of neglect, impairing the efficient functioning of the judicial system. Indeed, the\nsubordinate court facilities convey a negative image of the judicial system, seriously\nundermining the status and dignity of judicial institutions. Comparative experience has shown\nthat adequate physical infrastructure is, perhaps surprisingly, an important performance\nincentive. For example, in Singapore, the capital budget for the judiciary was increased\nsignificantly in 1991, and by 1993 there was a 39 percent decrease in pending cases. Panama\nincreased its capital budget in 1992-1993, and by 1994, the number of pending cases had\ndecreased by 70 percent and the number of cases disposed had increased by 39 percent.12\n16. Access to Justice. The lack of a tradition to disclose information relating to public\ninstitutions lies at the root of some of the fundamental barriers to accessing justice in the\ncountry. Even when policies are translated into law, the laws are published in English, thereby\ndisenfranchising the majority of the population that has a basic literacy rate of about 45 percent\nin Urdu, the official language of the country. A large proportion of the population, especially\nwomen (women's literacy is only 33 percent) and the poor (34 percent of the population lives\nbelow the income poverty line), remain unaware of their legal rights. While some attempts have\n\u00b0 The provincial administrations spend as much on jails as they do on the administration of justice, while the\nexpenditure on police is 11 times as much, and general administration is between 14 and 18 times as much as\nallocations for judicial administration.\nSome members of the bar who oppose any increase in court fees under the present system have stated that they\nare in favor of raising court fees, provided that there is a mechanism to ensure that the extra revenues will be used\nfor the courts alone.\n12 One of the underlying reasons for the benchmark 15 percent of judicial budgets focused on capital investment in\nfacilities and technology in TA 3015-PAK is that comparative experience shows that these nonoperational cost\nexpenditures are an important part of the incentive mix to improve performance.", "5\nbeen made to promote legal literacy, particularly among women, basic information explaining\nrights and procedures in courts is not available. Public information offices or information booths\nin courts to meet the needs of the public are yet to be developed. This situation is particularly\nserious in the context of insufficiently developed civil society institutions that can move to fill this\ninformation gap.\n17. The lack of an established redressal system for citizen's complaints against public\ninstitutions and also grievances within government departments has caused both the\nombudsman's office and the courts to be overburdened with petty, avoidable, and fruitless\nlitigation. Grievance mechanisms within government departments need to be established\ntogether with reforms to activate and strengthen aspects of the ombudsman's law and practice.\nThis will serve two important goals simultaneously: to improve public sector practice, and to\ndecongest the courts of cases against the government that should not be there in the first\ninstance.\n18. Exclusion of women from the judicial system as judges and lawyers is particularly\ndisturbing at a time when the number of women accessing the courts, especially in family\ndisputes, is increasing.13 Correcting this gender imbalance requires a long-term strategy to\nimprove women's access to education, especially legal education, and sensitize policymakers,\njudges, and lawyers to gender issues in the legal system. In the short term, the gender bias in\nservice rules for subordinate judges needs to be removed, e.g., the maximum age for\nappointment as a subordinate judge needs to be raised and gender sensitization needs to be\nmainstreamed in judicial training programs. There also needs to be an effort to increase the\nnumber of women judges at all levels.\n19. Human Resources in the Courts and the Legal Profession. Pakistan has\nexperienced a decline in both professional standards and in the quality of legal education over\nmany decades, which has also had an adverse effect on the quality of the judiciary. Each of the\neight major Law Commission reports since 1958 has strongly recommended strengthening the\nquality of faculty, students, standards, curriculum, and facilities in law schools. However,\nvirtually none of those recommendations were implemented due to lack of political commitment\nand lack of incremental budget allocation. A national council of legal education that can set,\nmonitor, and enforce standards in legal education is urgently required, as well as the creation of\nseveral centers of legal education that can have a demonstration effect. Dialogue for reform\nwithin the profession and civil society needs to be initiated about the role, responsibilities, and\nregulation of the legal profession. Strengthened governance and management must be\npromoted under the supervision of high-quality faculty committed to professionalization and\nquality.\n20. To institutionalize legal training, the Federal Judicial Academy (FJA), well-equipped with\nexcellent infrastructure and hostel facilities for trainees, was set up in 1988. However, FJA is not\nfully operational as most of the positions lie vacant or are filled on an acting basis only, and it\nhas inadequate budget. Strengthening of the judicial system will require substantial investments\nin (i) preservice and in-service training for judges and nonjudicial staff, (ii) development of\njudicial research and reference materials (e.g., benchbooks), (iii) establishment of a judicial\nmentoring system to provide subordinate court judges with the skills needed to reduce delay,\nand (iv) fellowships in judicial administration.\nThe sociolegal study under TA 3015-PAK shows that an increasing number of women are parties to suits filed in\nthe courts. The difficulties of accessing of courts by women underlines the need to improve the capacity of the\nformal court system to deliver justice. Without such improved capacity women are effectively disempowered.", "6\n21. Economic Law Reform. A major problem in the administration of economic laws relates\nto slow dispute resolution in courts. Commercial disputes in Karachi, the largest commercial and\nfinancial center in the country, can take 10 years to decide, not taking into account appeals.\nThis is particularly so for corporate reorganization and insolvency. Pakistan needs a system for\nexpedited dispute resolution. Apart from creating specialized commercial courts or benches in\nthe high courts, the arbitration law and the law relating to corporate reorganization and\ninsolvency needs urgent reform. Reform of the latter is also consistent with the capital market\nreforms adopted by the Government and supported by the Bank. 14 The present procedures add\nto the cost and risk of economic transactions, and form a disincentive to investors and to\neconomic growth. The Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan has also asked the\nBank for assistance in examining alternatives to the present cumbersome corporate\nreorganization and insolvency procedures, and developing appropriate solutions.\n22. The proposed TA will be a third, careful step toward the reconstruction and\nreinvigoration of public institutions with special, though not exclusive, emphasis on the\njudiciary.15 The TA wilt play a bridging role between the earlier diagnostic analysis of the\nproblems and solutions, and the implementation of full-fledged reforms under a comprehensive\nreform program for which the Government is seeking external financing. Past law reform efforts\nhave generally failed due mainly to lack of political support. However, strong political leadership\nhas significantly contributed to the success of previous Bank-financed TA, which has followed a\nparticipatory and policy-based approach. Building on this experience, the proposed TA will\nrefine the design of policy measures and initiate activities to build capacity and test the will of\nthe executive and the judiciary to implement strategic judicial and governance reform measures\nin their respective spheres.\n23. The Government and the superior courts have expressed keen interest in addressing the\ncritical issues. Extensive discussions have been held with the superior courts, the Government,\nand parts of civil society so as to shape and evolve the legal and judicial reform process. The\nGovernment has already taken initial steps toward such reform by establishing the Federal\nSteering Committee (FSC) under MOL. At the provincial level, the high courts have also formed\nprovincial steering committees (PSC5). To support these initiatives and continue the process\nthat the earlier TAs have set in motion, institutional capacity for judicial and legal reform needs\nto be enhanced. Further, as the next stage in a long-term reform program, key governance and\ninstitutional reforms that have been carefully prioritized will be initiated and pilot tested to set the\nscene for subsequent reforms. The subsequent reform package (see para. 3) is under\npreparation and strong financing interest has been indicated by the governments of Canada,\nSwitzerland, and the United Kingdom, and by the European Union.\nIll.\t THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n24. The TA has the twin aims of assisting the Government to strengthen institutional\ncapacity for judicial and legal reform and to initiate key priority reforms. The TA will pursue these\nobjectives by (i) assisting in training a core team mainly comprising members of the steering\ncommittees, the judiciary, and selected institutions such as FJA to carry out judicial and legal\nreform; and (ii) initiating key governance and institutional reforms (such as a judicial policy-\nLoan 1576-PAK: Capital Market Development Program, for $250 million, approved on 6 November 1997.\n15 Following the implementation of the two previous TAs, TA 2979-PAK and TA 3015-PAK.", "making body at the national level, the JO at the provincial level, and a judicial development\nfund). The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nB.\t Scope\n25.\t Building upon the work under the two ear'ier TA projects, the proposed TA will comprise\nthe following seven components.\n1.\t Judicial Policy and Administration\n26. Enhance Institutional Capacity for Judicial and Legal Reform. In-country training will\nbe provided to members of the superior and subordinate courts, the federal and provincial\nsteering committees, and other personnel associated with judicial and legal reform. The in-\ncountry training will focus on judicial reform processes, court administration and case flow\nmanagement, and budgetary and financial management for the courts. International study tours\nwill be provided to about 30 personnel, selected in accordance with criteria to be agreed to by\nthe Government and the Bank, to introduce them to reforms in other judicial systems.\nFellowships in court administration and case management will be provided to five personnel\nselected by the Government, in consultation with the Bank.\n27. Modernizing Judicial Statistics and Annual Reports.  A modern judicial statistical\nsystem will be designed to support informed policy-making. Specific judicial performance\nstandards, based on best international practices, will be adopted to evaluate the working of the\njudicial system, and a format for annual reports for each of the five superior will also be\ndesigned. This will assist the courts in establishing effective systems for collecting, analyzing,\nand reporting to the public. Equipment (photocopier, computer and printer, and facsimile\nmachine) will be provided to each steering committee to carry out this component and other\nactivities under the TA.\n28. Operationalizing Key Institutions for Judicial and Legal Reform.  In conjunction with\ndrafting of relevant legislation for key institutional changes, detailed organizational\nrecommendations and information, including financial analysis and budget, for operationalizing\na judicial policy-making body, the JO, and a judicial development fund will be prepared.\n29. Budgetary Allocations. In consultation with the high courts, the provincial\ngovernments, and the Ministry of Finance, a plan for increasing budgetary allocations to the\njudiciary to 1 percent of provincial budgets will be developed. Financial governance criteria for\njudicial administration, including a formula for allocating budgetary resources to the high courts\nand the subordinate courts, will also be developed.\n30. Pilot Projects on Management Information Systems Initiatives. The following\nmanagement information system initiatives will be developed on a pilot basis: (i) introduction of\ncomputers in the judges' chambers of the Supreme Court; (ii) publication of the cause list using\nappropriate software; (iii) developing case filing and indexing system in the high courts; and\n(iv) developing a case tracking system in the Supreme Court, Sindh High Court, and Lahore\nHigh Court. Computing equipment will be provided to these courts.\n2.\t Delay Reduction Pilot Projects\n31.\t Based on the recommendations of the legal and judicial reform TA (footnote 2), pilot\ndelay-reduction projects will be developed and implemented; two in Karachi, and one each in", "8\nthe other provincial capitals and in Islamabad. The projects will include the creation of  an ADR\ncenter annexed to each pilot court. Noncomputing equipment will be provided to each pilot\ncourt. Regular stakeholder consultations will be held, and on the basis of the experience gained,\na document for use with the training of new judges will be prepared, and areas for future delay\nreduction initiatives and research will be identified.\n3.\t Improving Access to Justice\n32. Laws in Local Language. Capacity for translation of bills and laws and their initial\npublication in Urdu will be enhanced. In particular, assistance will be provided to translate legal\nterms in English into Urdu. Coordination will be undertaken with suitable agencies on the\ntranslation and publication of legal materials, including the Urdu Language Authority. Training\nwill also be provided to persons responsible for the translation.\n33. Women and Law. Barriers to women's entry to the judiciary will be further examined\nusing the report from the TA to strengthen Government's legal services and the subordinate\njudiciary (footnote 2). In particular, service rules will be revised to actively encourage women\napplicants to the judiciary. Gender sensitization will also be mainstreamed in judicial training\nprograms.\n34. Administrative Grievances. Upgrading the capacity of the Ombudsman Office to\nresolve administrative grievances through informal procedures as envisaged under the\nOmbudsman Order.\n35. Freedom of Information. A committee on freedom of information will be established to\ndevelop new freedom of information policies and laws, including a document classification\nsystem. The committee will be assisted by the consultants to build its capacity, taking into\naccount the experience of international best practices.\n4.\t Judicial Training\n36. Enhancing the Institutional Capacity of FJA. Institutional capacity of FJA will be\nenhanced by providing assistance to train staff, develop curricula and training manuals, and\ntrain trainers in adult education techniques, judicial education pedagogy, and international\njudicial education standards. The Government will fill vacant positions and augment FJA's\nbudget as part of its contribution to the Project. Preservice and in-service training will also be\nprovided to upgrade the skills of the judicial cadre, based on the curricula developed under the\nearlier TA and the training provided to trainers.\n37. Development of Benchbooks. To promote judicial education as part of the larger\nreform effort under judicial and legal reform, benchbooks will be developed for use by civil\njudges and judicial magistrates.\n5.\t Legal Education and Legal Profession\n38. Centers of Excellence in Legal Education. A study will be carried out to examine the\nviability of setting up two centers of excellence in legal education. Careful consideration of the\nproblems facing existing law schools (e.g., politicization of students and faculty, and weak\ngovernance) suggests that these centers of excellence should be based in institutions untainted\nwith these problems. As a result, establishment of these centers at the Lahore University of\nManagement Sciences and the Institute of Business Administration in Karachi is considered", "appropriate. Lahore University of Management Sciences is in the private sector, while the\nInstitute of Business Administration is in the public sector and was one of the first business\nschools established in Asia. Both institutions enjoy good academic reputations and are free from\nthe major problems facing higher education institutions. A law faculty in addition to business and\nmanagement studies has proved to be a successful combination in many universities in other\ncountries.\n39. Strengthening the Legal Profession. Assistance will be provided to the FSC to publish\nan issues paper, in English and Urdu, on strengthening the legal profession and carrying out\nstakeholder consultation. Key stakeholders will be invited to present discussion papers on\nspecific areas relating to the legal profession. The Government will use the discussion papers\nas the starting point to initiate a public debate on the legal profession.\n6.\t Economic Law Reform\n40. This component will focus on developing a scheme to establish commercial courts or\ncommercial divisions within the high courts. Organizational and financial aspects will be\nexamined in detail. Development of a corporate rescue regime prior to winding up bankrupt\ncompanies will also be studied.\n7.\t Drafting and Amending Existing Legislation and Rules\n41. Based on the recommendations under the legal and judicial reform TA (footnote 2), the\nfollowing legislation will be drafted: (I) amendments to the Civil Procedure Code and High Court\nRules on measures to reduce the level of court delay; (ii) bills for the National Council for Legal\nEducation and National Fund for Innovations in Legal Education, including preparing\norganizational details and budget requirements; (iii) law for the establishment of an effective\nmechanism to expand access to alternative methods for dispute resolution; and (iv) legislation\nto replace the existing Arbitration Act, 1940. Coordination with concerned stakeholders will be\nundertaken in the drafting of recommended proposals. To enhance MOL's capacity in legal\ndrafting, long term training will be provided to one person on the condition that such a person\nwill serve as a legal draftsman for at least 5 years in MOL and organize short term training\ncourses on legal drafting for government lawyers.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n42. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $3,630,000 equivalent, comprising a foreign\nexchange cost of $1,800,000 and local currency cost of $1,830,000 equivalent. The Bank will\nfinance $2,900,000, including the entire foreign exchange cost and $1,100,000 equivalent of the\nlocal currency cost, on a grant basis from the Bank-funded TA Program.

However, there are also a number of additional\ndistrict and session judges who exercise the power of the district and session courts. In addition to their judicial\nfunctions, the district and session judges are the administrative heads of the district and session courts and also\nexercise administrative supervision over civil courts in their districts.\n** In each sub-district, there are civil courts (first, second and third grade in order of descending pecuniary\njurisdiction). The civil courts are headed by chief civil judge who, in addition to his judicial functions, is also\nresponsible for administrative matters in civil courts. In all provinces, except Sindh where pecuniary jurisdiction of\na first-class civil judge is limited, first-class civil judges exercise unlimited pecuniary jurisdiction (i.e., they can try\ncivil suits of any value). In each district, a senior civil judge exercises delegated powers of the district judge\nrelating to institution and distribution of civil cases among civil judges in the district. He also exercises\nadministrative functions.\nSince the Supreme Court judgment in 1997 on the separation of the judiciary and any executive, almost all civil\njudges also act as magistrates (first, second or third class with descending jurisdiction over crimes). Few of the\nformer executive magistrates continue to exercise jurisdiction over specified matters; most have not been\nabsorbed into the judiciary. In practice, this has meant that in most provinces, the work load of the civil judges\nhas almost doubled, thus exacerbating the problem of delay in courts.\nFSC is also an appellate court from the session and magistrate courts for categorized cases.\nSource: Mission.\n(Reference in text: page 2, para. 5)", "\t\nAppendix 2, page 2\n17\nFigure A2.2: Number of Citizens per Judge, Selected Countries, 1998\n148,263\n160,000\n114,812\n140,000\t\n97,310!\n120,000\n100000\nfl60586\n80,000\n60000\n40,000\t 15,369 8,966\nL/\nF, ',' '\nSource: Oxner, S. 1999.

The consultants will design and deliver an in-country training program focusing\non judicial reform processes, court administration and case-flow management,\nalternative dispute resolution (ADR), and budgetary and financial management for the\ncourts. The consultants will work with the Federal Judiciary Academy (FJA) to define a\nstrategy for FJA in the reform process.\n2. The consultants will arrange international study tours for about 30 selected\npersonnel who have participated in the in-country training course in accordance with\ncriteria to be agreed by the Government and the Bank.\nb. Designing a Modern System of Judicial Statistics and Annual\nReports: one international consultant (2 person-months) and one domestic consultant (3\nperson-months).\n3. The existing data collection by the high courts will be reviewed to design a\nmodern judicial statistical system that can support informed judicial policy-making.\nSpecific judicial performance standards, based on best international practices, will be\nformulated to evaluate the working of the judicial system, including court procedures,\nefficiency of the courts, criteria for creation of judicial and nonjudicial posts, and\nappropriateness of the incentive systems relating to filing of cases and performance of\njudges. The consultants will further refine the design of the \"taxonomy of delay\" and\n\"litigant/would be litigant\" surveys under Technical Assistance (TA) 3015-PAK1 and carry\nthem out. In particular, the surveys will focus on who uses the courts and for what\npurpose. Use patterns and their implication for court fees will also be analyzed. Public\nperceptions of courts will be gauged. The survey design and analysis will reviewed by a\npeer group, and the results published in Urdu and English. A format for annual reports to\nbe published by each superior court and to be available to the public will also be\ndesigned to provide greater transparency to the working of the judicial system and\nmanagement of resources. This component will assist the courts in establishing effective\nsystems for collecting data, analyzing the data, and reporting judicial statistics in a\nsuitable format for annual reports.\nc.\t Operationalizing Key Institutions for Reform: one international\nconsultant (6.5 person-months) and two domestic consultants (6 person-months each).\n'TA 3015-PAK: Legal and Judicial Reform Project, for $995,000, approved on 7 May 1998.\n(Reference in text: page 10, para. 45)", "Appendix 4, page 2\n21\n4.
