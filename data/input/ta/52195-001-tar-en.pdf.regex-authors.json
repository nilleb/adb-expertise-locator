The Terai, the flat river plain of southern Nepal with fertile alluvial soils, occupies about \n17% of the country\u2019s total land area and accounts for 50% of its total population.1 The Terai is \nseen as the granary of Nepal. The Terai is Nepal\u2019s most important agricultural region and \ndominates the production of major crops such as rice, wheat, pulses, sugarcane, jute, and \nmaize. The Terai has a long history of floods affecting farmland, crops, and livestock, with \nimpacts to lives, livelihood, property, and food security of poor communities. In August 2017, \nabout 1.7 million people in the Terai were affected by flooding, with damage estimated by the \ngovernment to be $584.7 million. The six subprojects have an estimated population of 1.8 \nmillion, with more than 70,000 persons exposed to the 1-in-50-year flood. Of these, 84% have \nrural-based agricultural livelihoods, which are frequently affected by flooding. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting the Government of Nepal to address \nflood risk in the Terai region through the Priority River Basin Flood Risk Management Project. \nThe project aims to reduce flood-related economic and social losses in six priority river basins in \nthe Terai region of Nepal by strengthening integrated disaster risk management approaches.2 \nThe project will strengthen and build the capacity of the Department of Water Resources and \nirrigation (DWRI) and Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), (the implementing \nagencies)  to  manage  flood  risks  and  provide  training  to  local  communities  on  flood  risk \nreduction.  It  will  contribute  to  improved  infrastructure,  increased  agricultural  and  livestock \nproduction, and disaster risk management by protecting agricultural land from flooding, adopting \neco-friendly technologies, and promoting water disaster risk reduction activities. \n \n3.  The project is aligned with the following impact: social and economic losses because of \nwater induced disasters reduced.3 The project will have the following outcome: resilience of \ncommunities to flood risks of selected river basins in the Terai region improved. The project will \nhave three outputs: (i) flood protection infrastructure and maintenance system improved, (ii) \nflood forecasting and response systems enhanced, and (iii) flood prevention and preparedness \ncapacity improved. The government has requested (i) a concessional loan of $40.00 million \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, and (ii) a grant not exceeding $10.00 million from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources (Asian Development Fund) to help finance the project. \n   \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n4.  The  transaction  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  provide  capacity  building  for  the \nimplementing  agencies  to  implement  integrated  flood  risk  management  of  the  project  and \nimprove sustainability of the infrastructure constructed under the project. This transaction TA is \ncurrently  listed  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan  for  Nepal,  2020\u20132022  as \nImplementation  Support  for  the  Priority  River Basin  Flood  Risk  Management  Project.4 The \ntransaction TA is proposed to be attached rather than part of the loan to allow for efficient \nconsultant recruitment and management and close supervision by ADB. \n \n1  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 2019.

The TA will support the DWRI and the DHM with implementation, including the following: \n(i) review current asset management systems; (ii) propose improved asset monitoring and \nmanagement systems; and (iii) provide capacity building to the DHM, DWRI, and provincial and \nlocal governments. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1:  Strategic flood risk management planning improved. The TA will (i) build \ncapacity  of  the  DWRI,  provincial  governments,  and  local  governments  (municipalities)  in \nprioritizing flood protection works through consultant support and tailored training program and(ii) \nsupport the implementation of the Priority River Basin Flood Risk Management Project. \n \n7.  Output 2: Flood infrastructure asset management improved. The TA will (i) support \nthe  DWRI  to  develop  a  simple  asset  management  system  for  embankments  (geographic \ninformation  system-based  open  freeware),  and  (ii)  will  provide  guidance  to  the  DWRI  on \nimproving monitoring, evaluation, and maintenance of the flood management infrastructure. \n \n8.   Output 3: Flood preparedness improved. The TA will support the DHM to develop the \nflood forecasting and early warning systems through international consultant support. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,315,000 of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6) and (ii) $750,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Netherlands Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility. \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n10.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace,  office supplies,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  government  was  informed  that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  ADB will administer the TA. ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants, and \nprocure  goods.  ADB  will  evaluate  the  progress  of  the  TA  through  regular  consultations, \nincluding regular review missions including meetings with stakeholders. The Ministry of Energy, \nWater Resources and Irrigation will be the executing agency. \n \n12.
