An initial environmental examination was undertaken. \nAssessment \n   \nProject Description  The  Project  represents  a  5-year  time  slice  of  POWERGRID's \nNational  Transmission  Development  Plan  (NTDP)  covering \nstrengthening  and  expansion  of  765  kilovolt  (kV)  and  400  kV \ntransmission lines and associated substations. \n   \nRationale  As electricity is one of the key drivers for economic growth and \npoverty reduction, the Government has set the target of installing \nan additional 100,000 megawatts (MW) of generation capacity to \nprovide electricity access to all households by 2012. India faces a \ngrowing  deficit  of  electricity.  Unless  dealt  with  quickly  and \neffectively, this deficit will impair the cost, quality, and reliability of \nelectricity  delivery  to  rural,  industrial,  services,  trade,  and \nresidential  consumers  across  the  country.  Load  shedding \n(rationing)  and  significant  voltage  fluctuations  are  already \nprevalent, especially in the highest deficit regions, undermining the \noperating  cost  structures  of  businesses  across  industry, \nagriculture,  services,  and  trade;  bringing  down  productivity; \ncurtailing competitiveness; and ultimately constraining economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction.  \n \nWith increased generation capacity, transmission bottlenecks will \nworsen,  resulting  in  increased  transmission  losses  unless  the \nnational transmission grid is strengthened and developed. Open \ntransmission access and development of a national market for \npower trading,  as provided under the Electricity Act 2003, are \nsignificant policy developments that require a robust and reliable \ntransmission grid to ensure smooth power flow within the whole \npower  system.  POWERGRID's  NTDP  entails  an  investment \nprogram  of  about  $12.6  billion  up  to  year  2012.  The  huge \ninvestment program will not materialize without long-term finance. \nLocal finance is available, but the terms are comparatively short. \nThrough this intervention, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) can \nbe  considered  a  catalyst  and  additional  in  the  context  of \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  investment  program.  A  robust  and  reliable  \nnational transmission grid with an enabling environment will  attract  ", "iv   \n  increased private sector participation in generation, transmission, \nand distribution. Policy dialogue on safeguard issues and ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement  in  reviewing  and  providing  comments  to  refine \nPOWERGRID\u2019s environmental and social policy and procedures \nwill  contribute  to  POWERGRID's  adoption  of  best  practices  in \nsafeguard policies and implementation of safeguard measures. In \naddition, policy dialogue in collaboration with other development \nagencies  will  contribute  to  prudent  financial  management  and \nimproved  corporate  governance  of  POWERGRID.  ADB\u2019s \ncontinuing support for POWERGRID will help meet the funding \ngap, and improve the confidence of private sector investors in the \nnascent regulatory framework. \n   \nObjective  The objective of the Project is to help strengthen and develop \nIndia\u2019s  national  transmission  grid  to  improve  system  reliability, \nfacilitate interstate and interregional power transfers by removing \ntransmission  bottlenecks,  reduce  transmission  losses,  facilitate \nefficient  utilization  of  existing  and  planned  power  plants,  and \nfacilitate development of a national power trading market through \nopen access to the national transmission grid.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The proceeds of the ADB loan will be used to finance subprojects \nunder POWERGRID\u2019s investment program. The subprojects are \nestimated to cost $568.0 million equivalent (inclusive of physical \nand price contingencies, and interest and other charges during \nconstruction). This comprises foreign exchange costs of $465.2 \nmillion and local currency cost of $102.8 million equivalent. \n \n  ($ million) \nItem  Foreign  Local   Total  \nExchange  Currency  Cost \nCore Subprojects       \n  Base Cost  168.0  23.3  191.3 \n  Taxes and Duties  0.0  11.7  11.7 \n  IDC  10.2  4.8  15.0 \nSubtotal  178.2  39.8  218.0 \nCandidate Subprojects  287.0  63.0  350.0 \nTotal  465.2  102.8  568.0 \nIDC = interest and other charges during construction. \nSource: Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Asian Development Bank \nestimates. \n \nFinancing Plan  ($ million) \nFinancing  Foreign  Local \nSource  Exchange  Currency  Total  % \nADB  400.0  0.0  400.0  70 \nPOWERGRID  65.2  102.8  168.0  30 \nTotal  465.2  102.8  568.0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Asian Development Bank \nestimates. \n   ", "  v\nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided  under  ADB's  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 20-year term including a \ngrace period of 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.75% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe Loan Agreement. The loan will close on 31 December 2009. \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The Project will be implemented using a sector loan approach. The \nArrangements  subprojects, which have not yet been appraised, will be submitted \nfor ADB\u2019s approval during the implementation stage. POWERGRID \nwill be responsible for planning, designing, contracting, testing, and \ncommissioning  the  subprojects.  POWERGRID  will  submit  an \nappraisal report for each additional subproject to ADB for approval. \nPOWERGRID  will  also  provide  ADB  with  quarterly  progress \nreports for project monitoring. \n   \nExecuting Agency  POWERGRID \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of goods and services for the Project will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Supply \nof  materials  will  be  on  the  basis  of  international  competitive \nbidding. To accelerate project implementation, POWERGRID is \nallowed  advance  procurement  action  for  eligible  subprojects. \nRetroactive financing is not allowed. \n   \nProject Benefits and  By strengthening and developing the national transmission grid, \nBeneficiaries  the Project is expected to result in efficient and more reliable \ndelivery of services to consumers, particularly benefiting industrial, \ncommercial, residential, and agriculture customers in the country. \nIn  addition,  by  inducing  industrial  and  commercial  activity,  the \nProject will create more job opportunities and improve productivity \nand the quality of outputs in the manufacturing and agriculture \nsectors.  This  will  lead  to  enhanced  production  and  national \neconomic  growth  that  will  increase  employment  and  income-\nearning  opportunities  for  the  poor.  The  Project  will  remove \ntransmission bottlenecks and reduce transmission losses, thereby \nmaking  more  electricity  available  to  increase  electrification \noutreach.  This  will  facilitate  employment  creation  and  increase \nopportunities for income generation for poor people living in areas \npreviously without access to electricity. The Project will provide \nemployment  for  poor  people  during  construction.  Poor  and \nvulnerable  consumers,  often  hardest  hit  by  inadequate  power \nsupply, load shedding, and poor power quality, will benefit from the \nProject. ", "vi   \nRisks and Assumptions  The disparity of investments in power generation, transmission, \nand distribution may result in some of the national transmission \ngrid not operating at full capacity. POWERGRID\u2019s NTDP is based \non the sequencing of generation plants in the least-cost generation \nexpansion plan developed by the Central Electricity Authority of \nIndia.  The  plan  assumes  a  certain  pattern  of  load  growth. \nHowever, state electricity boards in poor financial health may not \nbe able to adequately invest in associated state transmission and \ndistribution networks. To mitigate this potential risk, subprojects \nhave  been  carefully  chosen  to  ensure  that  investments  in  the \nnational transmission grid are properly planned and sequenced \nvis-\u00e0-vis generation and the state electricity boards\u2019 transmission \nand distribution investments. \n \nThe recently enacted Electricity Act 2003, especially the provision \nof open transmission access and development of a national power \ntrading market, is expected to be implemented in a transparent and \ntimely  manner  to  create  a  predictable  and  enabling  policy \nframework and regulatory process in the power sector. This would \nincrease competition and private sector participation. \n \nPrice  increases  in  steel  and  aluminum,  which  comprise  major \ncomponents  of  the  transmission  system,  will  increase  the \nestimated project cost. However, the sensitivity analysis shows \nthat the Project is economically robust even with price increases. \n \nNo technological risks exist. POWERGRID has been using extra-\nhigh voltage transmission technology and has sufficient in-house \ntechnical capability for design, project management and overall \nimplementation,  and  operation  and  maintenance  of  similar \nprojects. As it has been operating profitably since its first full year \nof  commercial  operation  that  ended  on  31  March  1993, \nPOWERGRID is expected to provide adequate funds for project \noperation and maintenance. ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID), guaranteed by India, for the Power \nGrid Transmission (Sector) Project.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  In  India,  the  total  power  generation  capacity  available  to  the  grid  was  112,000 \nmegawatts (MW) as of 31 March 2004, comprising 29,500 MW of hydro, 77,910 MW of thermal, \n2,720 MW of nuclear, and 1,870 MW of wind. State electricity boards (SEBs) own 62% of the \ntotal installed capacity, the central sector 26%, and the private sector 12%.  As of 31 March \n2004, the peak power deficit was about 11% (9,510 MW); the energy deficit about 7% (39,870 \ngigawatt-hours [GWh]). As of 31 March 2003, per capita electricity consumption stood at about \n567 kilowatt-hours (kWh). About 84% of villages, but only about 31% of rural households, were \nelectrified. Quality of power is poor, with frequent load shedding (rationing) and significant \nvoltage  fluctuation.  This  undermines  industrial  competitiveness  and  severely  constrains \neconomic growth. The power system comprises five interconnected electrical regions: northern, \nnortheastern, eastern, western, and southern. The sector analysis is presented in Appendix 1.  \n \n3.  The Tenth Five-Year Plan (the 10th Plan) targets a high growth rate of 8% per year to \nsustain poverty reduction. The Government recognizes electricity as one of the key drivers for \neconomic growth and poverty reduction, and has set the target of providing access to all \nhouseholds by 2012. To meet this target 100,000 MW of new generation capacity is needed. \nBecause natural energy resources are unevenly distributed and concentrated in a few pockets, \nnew generation plants such as hydropower and coal-fired mine-mouth plants are located far \naway from the load centers. To ensure reliable and secured delivery of power from generation \nprojects to end users, development of an adequate transmission system is vital.  \n \n4.  In India, transmission and distribution (T&D) losses are quite high compared with other \ncountries. The world average T&D loss is about 10\u201315%, while India\u2019s T&D loss as of 31 March \n2003  was  reported  to  be  about  33%.  However,  in  the  absence  of  adequate  metering \narrangements,  especially  for  agricultural  consumers,  some  of  the  losses  were  treated  as \nagricultural consumption. The actual losses are, therefore, thought to be much higher, with \nsome SEBs now reporting T&D losses as high as 45\u201355%. The major reasons for such high \nlosses are pilferage of electricity through unauthorized connections, tampering of meters, and \ntechnical losses originating from overloaded T&D networks. \n \n5.  The  organization  of  the  power  sector  is  determined  by  the  country's  dual  political \nstructure\u2014all major issues affecting the sector require concurrent action by the central and state \ngovernments. The financial health of SEBs has become a matter of concern for governments. \nSEB losses have reached an alarming level of Rs330 billion, equivalent to about 1.5% of gross \ndomestic product. The accumulation of electricity arrears to the central power utilities has grown \nto over Rs400 billion. Thus, poor creditworthiness of SEBs has considerably slowed private \nsector  investing  despite  the  central  Government\u2019s  enabling  and  encouraging  framework. \nConsequently, the Government formulated the Accelerated Power Development and Reform \nProgram (Supplementary Appendix A) to introduce reforms at the distribution level with an \noverall objective of reducing T&D losses to 15%. Implementation began in February 2000.  \n ", "2 \n6.  In line with the Electricity Regulatory Commission Act 1998, the Central Electricity \nRegulatory Commission (CERC) was established in 1998. CERC has full authority to determine \nbulk tariffs. The 1998 Act enables state governments to establish state electricity regulatory \ncommissions with jurisdiction over state power utilities. CERC regulates the interstate, regional, \nand interregional transmissions, while the 23 state electricity regulatory commissions regulate \nstate transmission and distribution. State and central regulatory commissions have powers to \ngrant, amend, and revoke licenses; regulate the performance of licensees; determine tariffs; \nsafeguard consumers' interest while ensuring cost recovery of electricity; promote development \nof markets, including trading; and rationalize electricity tariffs by making subsidies transparent. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  National Transmission Grid \n \n7.  POWERGRID,  established  as  the  central  transmission  utility  in  1989  and  fully \noperational in 1991, is responsible for developing and operating the national transmission grid \nspanning interstate and interregional transmission links, including load dispatch. Prior to 1991, \ncentral sector generating companies constructed and operated the transmission facilities to \nevacuate power from their power plants and transmit to client SEBs. Therefore, the national \ntransmission grid has historically evolved in an unplanned manner, resulting in transmission \nbottlenecks with high transmission losses. At present, transmission links within each electrical \nregion (interstate) and especially between the five electrical regions are limited.1  \n \n8.  With the addition of 100,000 MW of generation capacity by 2012, the transmission \nbottlenecks will worsen and transmission losses will increase unless the national transmission \ngrid is strengthened and expanded. In 2003, the Government enacted the Electricity Act, which \nincludes provision of open transmission access to facilitate development of a national market for \npower trading. POWERGRID responded by formulating the National Transmission Development \nPlan (NTDP) to develop a robust and reliable national transmission grid to ensure smooth power \nflow within the whole power system (Appendix 2). To implement the NTDP, investments totaling \nup to $12.6 billion over 8 years are needed, including from the private sector and commercial \ncofinancing. \n \n9.  The  huge  investment  program  will  not  materialize  without  long-term  finance.  Local \nfinance is available, but the terms are comparatively short. The involvement of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) can help bring down the total cost of funds to POWERGRID and \nultimately the tariff to end-users. Through this intervention, ADB can be considered a catalyst \nand additional in the context of POWERGRID\u2019s investment program. A robust and reliable \nnational transmission grid with an enabling environment will attract increased private sector \nparticipation in generation, transmission, and distribution. Policy dialogue on safeguard issues \nand  ADB\u2019s  involvement  in  reviewing  and  providing  comments  to  refine  POWERGRID\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  policy  and  procedures  (ESPP)  will  contribute  to  POWERGRID's \nadoption of best practices in safeguard policies and implementation of safeguard measures. \nAlso policy dialogue on prudent financial management and appointment of independent board \nmembers  will  contribute  to  improved  corporate  governance.  The  private  sector  has  been \ncautious to invest in a new unproven regulatory framework, and has contributed about $120 \nmillion to develop the national transmission grid, which is small compared with the overall need \n                                                 \n1  Only the eastern and northeastern regional power systems are operating in synchronous mode with frequency \ncontrol and power flow control schemes, while the other three regional power systems have been operating in \nasynchronous mode with interchanges of power with neighboring regional power systems on high voltage direct \ncurrent links, or on radial mode, alternating current transmission links. ", "3 \nof the NTDP. ADB\u2019s continuing support for POWERGRID will help meet the funding gap and \nimprove private sector confidence in the nascent regulatory framework (para. 25). \n \n2.  Asian Development Bank Strategy for the Power Sector \n \n10.  ADB's  strategy  for  the  power  sector2  is  in  synergy  with  the  10th  Plan  to  develop \ninfrastructure needed for economic growth and poverty reduction. ADB\u2019s assistance for the \nenergy sector3 has six main priorities: (i) reforming the power sector; (ii) promoting higher \nefficiency  and  low-carbon  power  sources;  (iii)  expanding  and  optimizing  transmission  and \ndistribution systems; (iv) providing institutional strengthening to implement reforms required by \nthe Electricity Act 2003; (v) promoting private sector participation; and (vi) encouraging energy \nconservation, and ensuring environmental and social sustainability.  \n \n11.  ADB  has  provided  support  for  nationwide  sector  reforms  through  Power  Finance \nCorporation Limited,4 a government-owned development finance institution for the power sector. \nTo overcome transmission bottlenecks, ADB\u2019s assistance is focused on strengthening the \nnational transmission grid through POWERGRID.5 The proposed sector loan will support the \ndevelopment of the national transmission grid and introduce best practices that will lead to pro-\npoor growth and poverty reduction consistent with ADB's country assistance strategy for India. \n \n12.  ADB has supported state power sector reforms and stand-alone investments in Assam, \nGujarat, and Madhya Pradesh, which included facilitation of private sector participation in \ngeneration facilities.6 ADB will continue to expand its promotion of state power sector reforms by \nincluding more states such as Uttaranchal and West Bengal; and by deepening its efforts in the \nstates where it is currently active such as Assam, Kerala and Madhya Pradesh. As requested by \nthe Government and due to the high prevalence of poverty, ADB is also considering initiating \npower sector-related activities in the northeastern states. \n \n3.  Lessons Learned \n \n13.  ADB has conducted four project performance audit reports for energy projects in India, \ncomprising two loans for thermal power stations, one loan for a hydrocarbon sector program, \nand one loan for gas rehabilitation and expansion. Relevant lessons learned are (i) the need for \nADB to be flexible and adaptable to changing conditions in India, (ii) land acquisition should be \ncarried out expeditiously to minimize implementation delays, (iii) construction contracts should \nbe properly packaged to facilitate implementation and coordination, and (iv) loan covenants \nshould be appropriate. \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2003. 2003\u20132006 Country Strategy and  Program for India.

Balanced  development  of  generation,  transmission,  and  distribution  is  essential  to \nimprove the power sector. As generation is attracting increasing private sector participation, \ncontinuing public investments in strengthening and expanding transmission and distribution \nsystems are needed. At the central level, ensuring open transmission access and development \nof a national power trading market to attract increased private sector investments in generation \nrequire a robust and reliable national transmission grid to ensure electricity flows smoothly from \ngenerators to distributors. At the state level, the poor financial health of most SEBs has resulted \nin inadequate investments in state transmission and distribution systems. Realizing that macro \nmanagement of the states\u2019 finances need to be improved for the successful turnaround of the \nstate power sector, ADB has been working with states to reform and restructure the power \nsector to bring a holistic change in their macroeconomic management. Improvements in the \npower sector to provide financial sustainability will increase the ability of state governments to \nallocate more resources for the social sectors to address poverty reduction. \n \n15.  The  ongoing  Power  Transmission  Improvement  (Sector)  Project  (footnote  5)  has \nencountered implementation delays with a subproject that has transmission lines emanating \nfrom a new power generation plant. Approval of the construction of the power plant and \ntransmission lines was delayed, and it is outside the control of POWERGRID. Subprojects \nunder the proposed sector Project will be carefully selected to ensure that investments are \nproperly planned and sequenced. \n \n4.   External Assistance \n \n16.  Previous ADB assistance and major assistance by other aid agencies to the power \nsector in India are listed in Appendix 3. ADB\u2019s total public sector lending to India was about $13 \nbillion as of 31 December 2003. Of this, 14 loans totaling about $3 billion (23%) were approved \nfor the power sector. The first four projects were for power generation, two were sector loans to \nsupport  efficiency  improvements  of  SEBs,  two  were  for  development  of  the  national \ntransmission grid, and the six most recent were for sector development to support sector \nrestructuring. Under its private sector operations, ADB has approved four loans totaling about \n$80  million  for  two  transmission  and  two  generation  projects.7 Power projects have been \nconsidered for financing under ADB's private sector infrastructure facility8 and the Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Finance  Company.9  ADB  has  approved  about  $19  million  for  33  technical \nassistance grants, mainly advisory, at the national and state levels.  \n \n17.  The World Bank, the other major funding source, has supported power generation, \ntransmission,  and  distribution  projects,  including  assistance  for  SEBs.  The  World  Bank  is \nsupporting power sector reforms in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Orissa, Rajasthan, and Uttar \nPradesh. In Andhra Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, power sector reform is viewed as part of overall \nreform of the state finances. ADB coordinates closely with the World Bank to ensure overall \ncomplementarity of actions and consistency of policy advice at the central and state levels.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1991.

The Japan Bank for International Cooperation is supporting the expansion of public \nsector generation, transmission, and distribution, including rural electrification. The Department \nfor International Development of the United Kingdom is financing studies for power sector \nrestructuring in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Orissa, and West Bengal; and recently started an \nextensive program in Madhya Pradesh and Assam in coordination with ADB and the Canadian \nInternational Development Agency. The  United States Agency for International Development \nhas (i) supported studies for state sector reforms through the Power Finance Corporation; (ii) \nprovided grant assistance for energy management, conservation, and training; (iii) extensively \nsupported and continues to support policy aspects of private sector participation and renewable \nenergy development; and (iv) recently started a new program to modernize distribution. The \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency helped Kerala and Madhya Pradesh conduct \nextensive studies to restructure their power sectors. Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau of Germany \n(KfW) supports thermal and hydropower generation, including rehabilitation and modernization. \n   \n5.  Policy Dialogue \n \n19.  ADB, in close coordination with other major development partners active in the power \nsector, have through policy dialogue facilitated a policy environment conducive for efficient \noperations in the power sector. The unbundling of generation, transmission, and distribution of \ncentral  power  agencies  with  POWERGRID  as  the  independent  national  transmission  grid \noperator;  involvement  of  a  public-private partnership in transmission; implementation of an \navailability-based tariff structure for economic generation dispatch; reforms in SEBs (the clients \nof POWERGRID); and recently enactment of the Electricity Act 2003 are important policy \ndevelopments. The key developments in the central policy environment are summarized in \nAppendix 4. During the processing of the proposed sector loan, the following policy issues were \ndiscussed with the Government and POWERGRID. \n \na.  Negative Pledge \n20.  The two previous ADB loans (footnote 5) to POWERGRID have a negative pledge \ncovenant relating to its borrowings.  The negative pledge clause under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility is only applicable to foreign currency borrowings. In order to maintain the existing \nrelationship with ADB, and not only secure but also deepen ADB\u2019s future involvement in its \ninvestment program, POWERGRID, in consultation with ADB, has taken action to obtain the \nconsent of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Bank of India, \nCayman Islands to cede a pari passu charge so that the charge to be created in favor of ADB \nshall rank equally and ratably to their loans to secure the payment of principal of and interest \nand other charges on the two previous ADB loans. Given the steps needed to meet the negative \npledge requirement subsequent to the positive actions by POWERGRID, it is expected that \ncompletion of the process will be achieved by 30 June 2005. A Board Paper was circulated on \n19 November 2004 seeking waiver of the negative pledge covenant under the two previous \nloans to POWERGRID with respect to its domestic borrowings in order to harmonize the \nnegative pledge conditions in those two loans with the current LIBOR-based loan regulations. A \ndetailed analysis of POWERGRID\u2019s borrowing requirements and financial performance has \nindicated that POWERGRID has been operating profitably since its first year of commercial \noperations that ended 31 March 1993. Since the commencement of ADB lending in 1996, \nPOWERGRID has consistently met all its debt service obligations.  \n ", "6 \nb.  Financial Governance \n21.  Collection  of  accounts  receivable  has  been  the  major  financial  concern  for \nPOWERGRID. In March 2003, the entire outstanding accounts receivable of SEBs, as of the \ncut-off date of 30 September 2001 and amounting to about Rs12 billion, were securitized by \nReserve Bank of India\u2019s tax-free bonds. Given that securitization of the outstanding accounts \nreceivable will only reduce the past dues of SEBs, POWERGRID has signed agreements with \n27 SEBs to pay their current dues through irrevocable revolving letters of credit opened in favor \nof POWERGRID and covering an amount equivalent to 100% of each SEB's average monthly \nbilling of the previous financial year as allowed by CERC. Currently, outstanding accounts \nreceivable are 2.4 months of equivalent sales. ADB, in consultation with other funding agencies \nincluding the World Bank, will require POWERGRID to maintain its accounts receivable to less \nthan 3 months of billable amount as allowed by CERC. In addition, ADB will not finance any \nsubprojects in SEBs with poor payment record of dues to POWERGRID.  \n  \n22.  As  part  of  overall  power  sector  reform,  the  Government  is  enhancing  governance \nthrough corporatization, independence of boards of directors from the Government, delegation \nof  powers  to  management,  computerized  management  information  systems,  and \ncommercialization  of  activities.  As  POWERGRID\u2019s  bonds  are  listed  in  the  Delhi  Stock \nExchange, the Government appointed three independent directors to POWERGRID\u2019s board of \ndirectors to fulfill the listing requirements of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. \nPOWERGRID is conducting a comprehensive review of corporate governance and financial \naccountability with assistance from the World Bank and will share the review findings with ADB.  \n \n23.  During project processing, the financial management structure of POWERGRID was \nassessed and found to be adequate (Supplementary Appendix B). Its financial accounting \nsystem is computerized with confidentiality and integrity at various levels. Existence of well-\ndefined  charts  of  accounts  enables  proper  recording  of  financial  transactions.  Accounting \npolicies, based on the accounting standards issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of \nIndia, have been framed for accounting and preparation of the financial statements. Accounting \nand financial reporting related responsibilities are carried out as per delegation of powers \ndefined  and  approved  by  POWERGRID\u2019s  board  of  directors.  Its  Finance  Department  has \ndeveloped written procedures and guidelines for this reporting. POWERGRID has constituted a \ncommittee  of  three  independent  chartered  accountants  to  review  its  existing  procedures, \nsystems, and capabilities in the area of financial management, including risk management. The \nupdated manuals have been shared with ADB. \n \nc.  Environmental and Social Safeguards \n24.  In 1998, POWERGRID adopted a comprehensive company policy on ESPP; it has a full-\nfledged department to manage environmental and social issues. Although the field practices of \nPOWERGRID are consistent with sound environmental, social, and resettlement management, \nsome  gaps  exist  compared  with  the  safeguard  policy  requirements  of  ADB.  These  were \ndiscussed with POWERGRID during project processing. As a result, POWERGRID is refining its \nESPP by constituting a review committee comprising civil society, academia, and development \npartners, including ADB and World Bank, to review the updated ESPP. Dialogue on safeguard \nissues and ADB's involvement in refining the ESPP will contribute to POWERGRID's adoption \nof best practices in safeguard policies and implementation of safeguard measures. \n ", "7 \nd.  Private Sector Participation in Transmission \n25.  ADB provided a technical assistance grant to POWERGRID to facilitate private sector \nparticipation in electricity transmission.10 The main deliverables included capacity building of \nPOWERGRID, and draft documentation relating to request for proposals and transmission \nservice agreements. As a result and through the ADB private sector window, ADB provided a \nloan for the first public-private partnership in power  transmission project in India of which \nPOWERGRID  is  one  of  the  sponsors  (footnote  7).  ADB's  participation  is  viewed  as \ndemonstrational and catalytic, as the public-private partnership project will facilitate the creation \nof a framework for power transmission participation by the private sector. Transparent and \ntimely  implementation  of  the  Electricity  Act  2003  will  foster  an  enabling  environment  for \nincreased  private  sector  participation,  especially  through  open  transmission  access  and \ndevelopment of a national power trading market with POWERGRID as the independent national \ntransmission grid operator. Continuing policy dialogue has been held with POWERGRID and \nthe Government to increase private sector participation through fair and transparent competition \nin developing the national transmission grid. POWERGRID has identified two more transmission \nprojects for private sector participation through open bidding. However, the private sector has \nbeen cautious in investing in transmission because of the unproven regulatory framework. In \naddition, the poor creditworthiness of SEBs has discouraged the private sector from investing in \nstate  transmission  networks.  Because  of  the  large  investment  needed  to  implement \nPOWERGRID\u2019s NTDP to 2012 (paras. 8 and 9), ADB\u2019s continuing support for POWERGRID will \nmeet the funding gap and improve private sector confidence in the regulatory framework. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Objective \n26.  The  objective  is  to  help  strengthen  and  develop  India\u2019s  national  transmission  grid. \nDevelopment of the national transmission grid is important given the location of natural energy \nresources and load centers (para. 3). The national transmission grid, comprising 765 kV and \n400  kV  transmission  lines  and  associated  substations,  needs  to  be  strengthened  and \naugmented to improve system reliability, facilitate interstate and interregional power transfers by \nremoving transmission bottlenecks, reduce transmission losses, facilitate efficient utilization of \nexisting and planned power plants, and facilitate development of a national power trading \nmarket through open access to the national transmission grid.  The Project Framework is in \nAppendix 5. \n \n27.  The sector loan modality is justified as (i) POWERGRID's NDTP is a well-defined sector \ndevelopment plan that covers all the five regional grids; and (ii) the Electricity Act 2003 provides \nthe enabling policy environment for wholesale competition, trading, and efficiency improvements \nin  the  Indian  power  sector.  POWERGRID  has  demonstrated  its  institutional  capacity  to \nimplement sector loans.  \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n28.  Technical  Justification.  The  Central  Electricity  Authority  carries  out  least-cost \ngeneration expansion and long-term transmission planning studies for the country using an \nintegrated resource planning approach to ensure optimum use of national power resources. \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 1999.  Technical Assistance to the Government of India for Private Sector Participation in Electricity \nTransmission. Manila. ", "8 \nBased on these studies, POWERGRID, as the central transmission utility, formulates its NTDP \nthrough  exhaustive  engineering  design  calculations.  POWERGRID  employs  state-of-the-art \ncommercially available power system simulation software packages to perform detailed power \nflow studies, short-circuit calculations, and dynamic and transient stability analyses to ensure a \nrobust yet optimal national transmission grid based on internationally proven extra-high voltage \nalternating current and high voltage direct current transmission technologies.  \n \n29.  Subproject Selection. Criteria include the following: \n \n(i)  The subproject should be technically feasible. \n(ii)  The subproject will be part of POWERGRID's NTDP. \n(iii)  Any subproject classified as category A in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment \nPolicy 2002 will not be eligible.  \n(iv)  The  subproject  will  not  include  transmission  lines  emanating  from  power \ngenerating stations. \n(v)  The SEB or other beneficiary of the subproject has a satisfactory payment record \nwith POWERGRID, i.e., has an accounts receivable owing to POWERGRID of 3 \nmonths or less. \n \n30.  Based on the data available and the eligibility criteria, ADB and POWERGRID have \njointly appraised the following three core subprojects covering the states of Andhra Pradesh and \nTamil Nadu, and the Union Territory of Pondicherry: \n \n(i)  Grid strengthening for Tamil Nadu I. The subproject comprises construction of \n600 circuit-kilometers (cct-km) of new 400 kV transmission lines from Tirunelveli \nto Udumalpet, and 220 cct-km of new loop-in-loop-out 400 kV transmission lines \nfrom Madurai to Trivandrum; construction of a new 400/220 kV substation with \n2x315  megavolt-ampere  (MVA)  transformation  capacity  at  Tirunelveli;  and \naugmentation of existing 400/220 kV substations at Udumalpet and Trivandrum, \neach with a 315 MVA transformer. \n(ii)  Grid strengthening for Tamil Nadu II. The subproject comprises construction of \n280 cct-km of new 400 kV transmission lines from Pugalur to Madurai, and 156 \ncct-km of new 400 kV transmission lines from Udumalpet to Arasur; construction \nof new 400/220 kV substations with 2x315 MVA transformation capacity each at \nPugalur and Arasur; and augmentation of 400/220 kV substation bays at Madurai \nand Udumalpet. \n(iii)  Grid strengthening for Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Union Territory of \nPondicherry includes the establishment of a new 2x315 MVA substation at \nPondicherry and Warangal by 60 cct-km line-in-line-out of one of the circuits of \nNeyveli-Sriperumbudur 400 kV double-circuit transmission line and 38 cct-km \nline-in-line-out of Ramagundam-Khammam 400 kV single-circuit transmission \nline, respectively. \n \n31.  Selection of additional subprojects after loan approval will satisfy the eligibility criteria \n(para. 29), and POWERGRID will follow procedures that include (i) carrying out a technical \nfeasibility study for each subproject; (ii) preparing a resettlement plan (RP); (iii) conducting an \ninitial environmental examination (IEE); and (iv) if indigenous people are impacted, preparing an \nindigenous peoples development plan (IPDP). The technical feasibility study will include a \ndetailed  engineering  design  of  the  subproject,  cost  estimates,  contract  packages,  and \nimplementation schedule. The RP and IEE must meet  the requirements of the resettlement \nframework (Supplementary Appendix C) and the criteria for environmental requirements as ", "9 \ngiven in the summary IEE (Supplementary Appendix D) and environmental assessment and \nreview framework (Supplementary Appendix E). If indigenous people are affected, an IPDP will \nbe  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  indigenous  peoples  development  framework  in \nSupplementary Appendix F. POWERGRID will submit an appraisal report (format provided in \nSupplementary  Appendix  G)  to  ADB  for  consideration  and  approval  of  each  additional \nsubproject. ADB will not consider any subproject that does not satisfy all of the eligibility criteria \n(paras. 29 and 31) or where the above procedures have not been followed. \n \nC.  Special Features \n32.  Programmatic Approach. ADB has adopted, as envisaged in the 2005\u20132007 country \nstrategy and program update (footnote 3), a programmatic approach by providing a series of \nloans to POWERGRID to help it implement its NTDP. The first phase, under the proposed loan, \ncovers  selected  subprojects  to  be  implemented  during  2005\u20132009. Subject to continuing \nimprovement  of  the  policy  environment  and  corporate  governance,  and  satisfactory \nimplementation and timely disbursements of the first phase loan, future assistance will depend \non POWERGRID\u2019s borrowing program. \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n33.  The Project consists of strengthening and augmenting POWERGRID's transmission \nlines and associated substations, which are part of POWERGRID's NTDP. The cost estimates \nof the three core subprojects, and additional subprojects to be implemented during 2005\u20132009 \nare summarized in Table 1.

Financing Plan \n34.  POWERGRID  has  requested  a  loan  of  $400  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 20-year term including a grace period \nof 5 years, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based  lending  facility,  commitment  charge  of  0.75%,  and  such  other  terms  and \nconditions set forth in the draft Loan Agreement and Guarantee Agreement. POWERGRID has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB.  ", "10 \n35.  POWERGRID will be the borrower, with a guarantee from the Government of India, and \nwill bear the foreign exchange risk. ADB will finance 70% of the total project costs (Table 2). \nPOWERGRID will fund the remaining 30% of the total project costs, including interest and other \ncharges  during  construction,  from  its  internal  cash  generation  and  domestic  commercial \nborrowings. The local currency costs will be financed through borrowings as part of the overall \ncorporate financing requirements.  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \nForeign  Local \nFinancing Source  Exchange  Currency  Total  Percent \nADB  400.0  0.0  400.0  70 \nPOWERGRID  65.2  102.8  168.0  30 \nTotal  465.2  102.8  568.0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, POWERGRID = Power Grid Corporation of India Limited \nNote: POWERGRID's foreign exchange contribution is for the interest and other charges during \nconstruction. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank and Power Grid Corporation of India Limited estimates. \n \n36.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  The Executing Agency \n \n37.  POWERGRID  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Project.  POWERGRID\u2019s \norganizational structure (Appendix 7) consists of (i) a corporate center at the head office in \nGurgaon (in the state of Haryana) that is responsible for overall corporate planning, system \nplanning  and  engineering,  management  of  transmission  system  operations  and  projects, \nfinance, commercial matters, and personnel; and (ii) regional offices. POWERGRID has been \noperating with a healthy profit margin since its first full year of commercial operations that ended \non 31 March 1993. Details of its past financial performance indicators, historical financial \nstatements, financial projections, and the critical assumptions used in developing the financial \nprojections are provided in Appendix 8. \n \n38.  Through  ADB\u2019s  continued  assistance,  POWERGRID  has  strengthened  its  project \ndevelopment, implementation capability, fund mobilization capacity, and financial sustainability. \nPOWERGRID\u2019s competence as an executing agency has been demonstrated by the successful \nimplementation of the ongoing Power Transmission Improvement (Sector) Project (footnote 5) \nas well as the earlier Power Transmission (Sector) Project (footnote 5), whose loan account was \nclosed on 9 July 2003. In addition to experience gained with POWERGRID under previous \nprojects,  assessment  of  the  financial  management  capacity  of  POWERGRID  (para.  23) \nindicates that POWERGRID systems and financial management processes are sufficient for \npurposes of project financial management. \n \n2.   Project Management \n \n39.  The Project will be implemented as a sector loan and additional subprojects will be \nconsidered during implementation. A draft project administration memorandum is included  in \nSupplementary Appendix H. POWERGRID has set up a project management unit headed by an \nexecutive  director  (corporate  planning)  at  its  headquarters.  The  unit,  through  the  related \nfunctional departments of POWERGRID, will be responsible for processing and implementing \nthe subprojects. POWERGRID has seven regional offices generally headed by an executive \ndirector to implement the subprojects under their respective jurisdiction. The deputy general \nmanagers in the region responsible for construction and commissioning of the subprojects will \nreport to their respective regional heads. The regional heads will facilitate submission of the \nimplementation  progress  reports.  The  management  of  POWERGRID  will  receive  monthly \nprogress reports and review each subproject in quarterly review meetings. In addition to ADB, \nthe project management unit will maintain regular consultations with other funding agencies \nincluding  the  Japan  Bank  for  International  Cooperation  and  World  Bank  during  project \nimplementation. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n40.  The Project will be implemented over 5 years, inclusive of procurement and construction \nactivities,  and  is  expected  to  be  completed  by  December  2009.  The subprojects will be \nimplemented from January 2005 to June 2009. The implementation schedule of the three core \nsubprojects  that  have  secured  in-principle  approval  from  the  Government  is  given  in \nAppendix 9. Advance procurement activities for the three core subprojects began in October \n2004. Unless otherwise acceptable to ADB, POWERGRID will submit for ADB's consideration \nnot  later  than  31  December  2005  the  appraisal  reports  for  additional  subprojects  to  be \nfinanced under the proposed loan. ", "12 \n4.   Procurement \n \n41.  Equipment and materials to be financed under the loan will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. International competitive bidding will be used for supply \ncontracts estimated to cost more than $500,000, international shopping for contracts from \n$100,000\u2013$500,000,  and  direct  purchase  arrangement  for  those  less  than  $100,000.  The \nagreed  upon  contract  package  list  for  the  three  core  subprojects,  which  will  attract \ninternational bidders, is given in Appendix 10. Contract packages and bid specifications have \nbeen prepared to ensure maximum competition under international competitive bidding. Similar \ncontractual structures and specifications will be applied to other subprojects. To facilitate \ntimely implementation of the Project and based on POWERGRID\u2019s effectiveness in handling \nprocurement under the two ADB-financed projects, POWERGRID has been allowed advance \nprocurement action for eligible subprojects. POWERGRID has been informed that approval of \nadvance  procurement  action  does  not  in  any  way  commit  ADB  to  finance  the  Project. \nPOWERGRID has also been allowed to use the modified ADB bid documents applied under the \nSipat subproject along with the agreed modifications (Supplementary Appendix I). \n \n42.  For contracts to be awarded based on ICB procurement procedures, POWERGRID shall \nbe exempted from ADB\u2019s prior review of its bid documents provided that such documents are \nforwarded at the time of their release to ADB for post-facto approval, and POWERGRID issues \namendments to such documents based on comments made by ADB, if any, during the bidding \nperiod. Further, POWERGRID may also award contracts of value less than $3 million in each \ncase without seeking approval of ADB, provided the lowest priced bidder is also the lowest \nevaluated bidder, and further provided that (i) all cases involving unusual issues shall be \nsubmitted to ADB for prior approval, and (ii) all cases shall be subject to post-facto approval of \nADB which shall retain the right to disallow utilization of loan proceeds in case it is unable to \nagree with POWERGRID on either the bid documents or the bid evaluation report. \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n43.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook, January 2001, and ADB's Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-\nBased Loan Products, July 2002, both as amended from time to time. No imprest account will \nbe required for disbursement under the loan. \n \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n44.  POWERGRID will maintain separate accounts for the Project. Within 6 months of the \nclose of the financial year, POWERGRID will submit (i) annual project accounts, with detailed \ndescriptions of the sources of receipts and expenditures; and (ii) annual financial statements \ncomprising an income statement, balance sheet, statement of cash flows, and related notes to \nthe financial statement and consolidated for all of POWERGRID\u2019s operations. POWERGRID will \ncontinue the current practice of hiring independent chartered accountants to audit its  annual \nfinancial statements and  annual project accounts, together with the memorandum on issues \nidentified during the audit process (i.e., management letter). These will be submitted with the \nrespective reports. As part of the harmonization of procedures of development agencies, the \nauditors\u2019 terms of reference will be approved by ADB in consultation with the World Bank prior \nto commencement of work. The accounts will be prepared using accounting standards issued \nby the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. The auditors will be required to provide an \nopinion on POWERGRID\u2019s compliance with ADB\u2019s financial covenants and indicate the details ", "13 \nof the actual calculation for all ratios, in conformity with the definitions contained in the Loan and \nGuarantee Agreements. \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n45.  POWERGRID will prepare quarterly progress reports and submit these to ADB within 45 \ndays after the end of each quarter. These reports will provide a narrative description of \nprogress made during the period, changes in implementation schedule, problems or difficulties \nencountered, and the work to be carried out in the next period. The progress reports will also \ninclude  a  summary  financial  account  for  the  project  components  including  subprojects, \nconsisting  of  project  expenditures  including  for  subprojects  during  the  period,  and  total \nexpenditure to date, and benefit monitoring in accordance with ADB's  Project Performance \nManagement Systems Handbook. Performance will be evaluated on the basis of performance \nindicators/targets stipulated in the Project Framework (Appendix 5). \n \n8.  Project Review \n \n46.  ADB  will  field  a  project  inception  mission  soon  after  loan  approval  to  initiate \nimplementation. ADB will review the implementation and operation of the Project based on \nquarterly progress reports and meet with POWERGRID and the Government semiannually to \ndiscuss project progress. A midterm review to be carried out 2 years after loan effectiveness will \nfocus on the engineering, resettlement, environment, and other social aspects of the Project; \nand review the financial status of POWERGRID. Representatives of ADB and POWERGRID will \ntake part in the review. The review will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure \nsuccessful project implementation and achievement of objectives. A project completion report \nwill be submitted within 3 months following project completion.  \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n47.  Based on the findings of an initial poverty reduction and social assessment carried out \nduring project preparation, a summary poverty reduction and social strategy was developed \n(Appendix 11). The Project is classified as sustainable economic growth. During project design, \nthe participatory approach included consultation with local governments and communities. \n \nA.  Social Aspects \n48.  Core  Subprojects:  The  three  core  subprojects  include  construction  of  five  new \nsubstations in the states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, and the Union Territory of \nPondicherry; all entail land acquisition. A full RP (Supplementary Appendix J) for the three core \nsubprojects was prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s Policy of Involuntary Resettlement 1995 \nand is based on all land needed to be acquired for construction of the five substations. The \nentitlement benefits are summarized in the summary resettlement framework (Appendix 12). \nAccording to the RP, the Project will acquire a total of 186 acres of land, of which 19 are \ngovernment land, 98 are private land, and the remaining 69 belong to Tamil Nadu Hindu \nReligious Endowment Board. An estimated 40 households previously cultivated these 69 acres \nand the acquisition would adversely affect their livelihood. However, this land has not been \nunder cultivation for the last 4\u20135 years due to inadequate rainfall and no irrigation facilities. \nDespite this, the land remains arable and affected families can cultivate if rainfall is adequate. \nThese households will be entitled to rehabilitation assistance preferably in income-generating \nschemes depending upon their aptitude/skills or alternatively they  may  be  offered  units  of \nequivalent financial reimbursement in the joint names of the spouses under a monthly income ", "14 \nscheme for regular income. Apart from this, POWERGRID will fund short and needs-based \ntraining to develop entrepreneurship skills required for successful implementation of selected \nincome-generating schemes for affected households. \n \n49.  In  addition,  the  substation  construction  in  Karmatthapuram  Village  in  Arasur  (Tamil \nNadu) will result in loss of a temple and will partially affect a pond currently used by villagers for \nsanitation purposes. The villagers will be entitled to replacement/augmentation of common \nproperty resources/amenities that will be carried out in consultation with affected people.  Land \nacquisition for the three core subprojects will affect an estimated 82 households, comprising 42 \ntitleholders and 40 households without formal titles. The land acquisition will not adversely affect \nany  commercial  or  residential  structures.  In  keeping  with  ADB's  Policy  on  Involuntary \nResettlement  1995  and  POWERGRID\u2019s  ESPP,  technical  design  for  the  proposed  five \nsubstations was adjusted to avoid or to minimize impacts especially if homestead land and \nhouses could be completely avoided.  \n \n50.  The  RP  provides  details  on  the  subproject  impacts  and  measures  proposed  for \nmitigation.  As  per  the  entitlement  matrix,  key  measures  include  compensation  at  full \nreplacement cost for all lost assets. In addition to payments by competent authority, affected \npeople will receive grants to meet replacement costs of lost assets, transaction costs such as \nstamps and registration costs (in case of purchase of replacement land), and other cash grants \nand  resettlement  assistance  such  as  compensation  for  loss  of  standing  crops  and  trees. \nHouseholds headed by women and other vulnerable households will be eligible for assistance in \naccordance with entitlements detailed in the RP.  \n \n51.  The detailed field surveys undertaken to assess the socioeconomic profile of the project \ncommunities did not find any scheduled tribes11 or indigenous people and groups in the project \narea. Socioeconomic data suggest that the majority population in the project area comprises \nother disadvantaged groups,12 followed by scheduled caste13 groups, and general population. \nAs  a  result,  the  Project  is  not  expected  to  have  any  adverse  or  differential  impacts  on \nindigenous people.  \n \n52.  Noncore  Subprojects:  A  resettlement  framework  and  an  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment  framework  were  prepared  and  will  serve  as  basis  for  preparing  subsequent \nresettlement plans and IPDPs for additional subprojects as required. All plans will be prepared \nin full consultation with affected persons and disclosed in draft form to them. The resettlement \nframework and indigenous peoples development framework was placed on the ADB website \nbefore submission of the Project for ADB Board approval.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis \n53.  The core subproject states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and Union Territory of \nPondicherry are among the better-off areas in the country in terms of per capita income, \neconomic  growth,  and  human  and  social  development.  The  National  Human  Development \n                                                 \n11 \u201cScheduled tribes\u201d are one of the weaker sections of the Indian Population. Article 342 of Constitution of India on \nfundamental rights defines scheduled tribes as a \u201cspecific tribe or tribal communities or parts or groups within tribes \nor tribal communities.\u201d The Constitution enshrines their rights taking into account their vulnerable status in society. \n12 The other low-ranking and disadvantaged groups (besides the scheduled tribes) in India are referred to as Other \nBackward Classes. Discrimination against these backward classes is prohibited by Article 15 of the Indian \nconstitution. The backward classes reportedly constitute an estimated 52% of India's population.  \n13 Similarly, \u201dscheduled caste\u201d is defined as the lowest caste in the Hindu caste system. Untouchables, also known as \nHarijans or Dalits, constitute the bulk of scheduled castes. ", "15 \nReport 2001 ranks the state of Andhra Pradesh 10th among the 15 major states calculated in \nterms of human development indices, with about 16% of the state population living below the \npoverty line (1999\u20132000) in comparison with national data of about 26%. On the other hand, the \nstate of Tamil Nadu is ranked 3rd out of 15 states calculated. In general, Tamil Nadu has been \nsuccessful in its overall efforts to address poverty, and the proportion of those living below the \npoverty line fell from over 35% in 1993\u20131994 to about 21% in 1999\u20132000. Similarly in the Union \nTerritory of Pondicherry, poverty levels were estimated at about 37% (1993\u20131994) and 21.67% \n(1999\u20132000).14 In all three areas, the proportion of people living below the poverty line has been \ndrastically reduced, with the poverty levels in the three areas largely lower than the national \naverage.15 However, in spite of this impressive performance, poverty remains pervasive with a \nlarge section of the population (scheduled castes/tribes, minorities, women) who have not \nbenefited from the economic and social development that the areas have experienced. \n \n54.  By strengthening and developing the national transmission grid, the Project is expected \nto result in efficient and more reliable delivery of services to consumers, particularly benefiting \nindustrial, commercial, residential, and agriculture customers in the country. In addition, by \ninducing industrial and commercial activity, the Project will create more job opportunities and \nimprove productivity and quality of outputs in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, leading \nto enhanced production and national economic growth that will increase employment and \nincome-earning opportunities for the poor. The Project will remove transmission bottlenecks and \nreduce transmission losses, thereby making more electricity available to increase electrification \noutreach. This will facilitate employment creation and income-generating opportunities for poor \npeople  living  in  areas  previously  without  access  to  electricity.  The  Project  will  provide \nemployment for poor people during construction. In addition, poor and vulnerable consumers \nwho are often hardest hit by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality \nwill benefit from the Project. \n \nC.  Environmental Assessment \n55.  The Project is categorized as a \u201cB\u201d project in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Environment \nAssessment Guidelines 2003. The three core subprojects, comprising transmission lines and \nassociated  substations  involving  mostly  wasteland,  and  agricultural  and  grazing  land  and \navoiding forestland, is not subject to the India Environmental Impact Assessment Notification \n(1994). The IEE, which included an environmental management plan with budget for the three \ncore  subprojects,  was  prepared  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Environmental  Assessment \nGuidelines 2003. Based on the environmental assessments and walkover surveys conducted \nfor the scope of activities under the three core subprojects, the associated potential adverse \nenvironmental impacts can be mitigated to an acceptable level by adequate implementation of \nthe measures outlined in the summary IEE in Supplementary Appendix D. The environmental \nanalysis is presented in Appendix 13. An environmental assessment and review framework is \nprovided in Supplementary Appendix E to guide preparation of IEEs for additional subprojects. \nAny additional subproject confirmed by ADB as environmentally B sensitive will require that the \nsummary IEE be made available to the general public at least 120 days before the subproject is \napproved by ADB. \n \n56.  The total length of transmission lines under the three core subprojects is about 570 \nkilometers (km); they pass through wasteland, agricultural land, and grazing land. No sections \n                                                 \n14  Government of India. 2002. National Human Development Report 2001. New Delhi. \n15  As per the National Human Development Report, 26% of India\u2019s population lived below the poverty line in 1999\u2013\n2000. ", "16 \nof the proposed alignments pass through forest or ecologically sensitive areas. No endangered, \nrare, or threatened species of flora or fauna have been reported in the core subproject sites. \nThe substations are located mostly on state government-owned land. The land acquired for the \nnew substations will not dislocate any ongoing agricultural activity or pass through any built-up \nareas. POWERGRID will prepare and implement the IEE and the related EMP (with budget) for \neach subproject. \n \n57.  POWERGRID  has  discontinued  procurement  of  polychlorinated  biphenyls  (PCBs) \ntransformer  oil;  pure  hydrocarbon  mineral  oil  is  specified  in  the  bidding  documents. \nPOWERGRID  will  comply  with  India's  Environmental  Protection  Act  and  other  applicable \nregulations for the handling of used transformer oil, which will be collected and reclaimed by \nauthorized contractors. POWERGRID has set up regional testing laboratories for testing of \nexisting oil for PCB traces. No significant concentrations of PCBs have been detected. \n \nD.  Economic Assessment \n58.  Analysis  of  economic  viability  involved  two  scenarios\u2014with  and  without  the \ninvestments (about $12.6 billion) in the transmission sector as per the NTDP between 2002 and \n2012. The economic internal rate of return of about 31% was calculated on the basis of \nincremental costs and incremental benefits. This and sensitivity analysis, under various adverse \nscenarios, confirm viability of POWERGRID\u2019s overall investment for the sector. Details of these \nanalyses are in Supplementary Appendix K, and a summary is presented in Appendix 14. \n \nE.  Financial Analysis \n59.  POWERGRID prepared financial projections in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on \nFinancial Governance and Management of Investment Projects to assess the financial viability \nand sustainability of the entire NTDP (2002\u20132012) using a time-slice approach (Appendix 8). \nBased on the financial projections, a long-term debt-equity ratio of 65:35 or better will be \nachieved over the life of the Project. \n \n60.  The  financial  evaluation  of  NTDP  (2002\u20132012) was undertaken in real terms using \nconstant 2004 prices. The project cost estimates and financial projections in nominal terms were \nconverted to real terms by adjusting for the projected effects of foreign and domestic inflation \nand currency fluctuation. Incremental benefits and costs were derived by evaluating the financial \nposition of POWERGRID under with- and without-NTDP scenarios. The financial internal rate of \nreturn, computed on an after-tax basis, is 7.9%. This compares favorably with the weighted \naverage cost of capital, also computed on an after-tax basis, of 4.5%. Sensitivity analysis was \nrun for a 10% increase in project cost and 1-year delay in project implementation with a 10% \nincrease in project cost that resulted in  financial internal rates of return of 6.7% and 6.2%, \nrespectively. Sensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the financial internal rate of return is \nrobust under adverse conditions. Therefore, the Project is considered both financially viable and \nsustainable as summarized in Appendix 14; details are in Supplementary Appendix L. \n \nF.  Risks \n61.  The disparity of investments in power generation, transmission, and distribution may \nresult  in  some  of  the  national  transmission  grid  capacity  not  operating  at  full  capacity. \nPOWERGRID\u2019s  NTDP  is  based  on  the  sequencing  of  generation  plants  in  the  least-cost \ngeneration expansion plan developed by the Central Electricity Authority that assumes a certain \npattern of load growth. However, the SEBs that are in poor financial health may not be capable ", "17 \nof adequately investing in associated state transmission and distribution networks. To mitigate \nthis potential risk, subprojects have been carefully chosen to ensure that investments in the \nnational transmission grid are properly planned and sequenced vis-\u00e0-vis generation and the \nSEBs\u2019 transmission and distribution investments. \n \n62.  Although the policy environment has been conducive for continuing policy reforms for a \nmore effective power sector, firm political commitment to the power sector reforms is assumed \nto continue. A second assumption is that the recently enacted Electricity Act 2003, especially \nthe provision of open transmission access and development of a national power trading market, \nwill be implemented in a transparent and timely manner to create a predictable and enabling \npolicy framework and regulatory process in the power sector to increase competition and attract \nincreased private sector participation. Any price increase in steel and aluminum, which comprise \nmajor components of the transmission system, will increase the estimated cost of the Project. \nHowever, the sensitivity analysis shows that the Project is economically robust even with \nincreases in steel and aluminum prices. POWERGRID is expected to provide adequate funds \nfor operation and maintenance of the Project. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n63.  In addition to standard assurances, the Government and POWERGRID have given the \nfollowing assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n1.  Implementation  \n \n64.  POWERGRID will be responsible for the planning, design and procurement under the \nProject as well as coordination of the Project.

Financial Governance \n \n69.  POWERGRID shall maintain its accounts receivable at a level not exceeding an amount \nequivalent to the income proceeds of its transmission services for the preceding three months of \nbillable amount as allowed by CERC.  \n ", "18 \n70.  POWERGRID  will  obtain  irrevocable  letters  of  credit  from  the  all  SEBs  and  other \nbeneficiaries, in the aggregate amounting to no less than 100% of average monthly billings of \nthe previous financial year as allowed by CERC. \n \n71.  POWERGRID will maintain a debt-equity ratio of 80:20 and a self-financing ratio of 20%.  \n \n4.  Policy Matters  \n \n72.  POWERGRID will continue  to function as the central transmission utility under the \nElectricity Act 2003, as amended from time to time, provide transmission services and facilitate \nprivate participation in power transmission.  \n \n73.  As per the current provision of its Department of Company Affairs, the Government will \nmaintain at least three non-government directors in the composition of POWERGRID\u2019s Board of \nDirectors and restrict the Government appointed directors to not more than two.  \n \n74.  POWERGRID will promptly exercise its rights including the right to effect the reduction of \nsupply under the commercial contracts with SEBs or other beneficiaries as well as under the \ntripartite agreements. \n   \n75.  POWERGRID will share, upon completion, the outcome of the detailed reviews on \nPOWERGRID  with  respect  to  (i)  corporate  governance  and  financial  accountability,  (ii) \nsafeguard management (environmental and social), and (iii) procurement management. \n \n5.  Environmental Matters  \n \n76.  POWERGRID will ensure that the Project is undertaken and all subproject facilities are \noperated and maintained, in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations of the \nGovernment, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy 2002, prepare and implement for each subproject, \nthe IEE (including related environmental management plan [EMP] with budget) in accordance \nwith said Policy and the Environmental Assessment and Review Framework in Supplementary \nAppendix E.  \n \n77.  Environment Category \u201cB Sensitive\u201d subprojects will be avoided to the extent possible. All \nadditional  subprojects  will  be  subject  to  ADB  classification,  and  any  subprojects  deemed \n\u201csensitive\u201d will require justification and documentation that anticipated impacts can be effectively \nmitigated.   \n \n78.  POWERGRID will ensure that all necessary environmental clearances are obtained from \nthe relevant statutory authorities of the Government and all environmental mitigation measures \nset forth in the IEE (including related EMP with budget) for each subproject are incorporated in \ndetailed designs (including any amendments on account of detailed designs with prior ADB \napproval) and followed during construction and operation of the subprojects. POWERGRID will \nmonitor, audit, and report quarterly, the implementation of the IEE  (including the EMP with \nbudget) for each subproject to ADB.  \n \n79.  POWERGRID will not undertake any works in any stretch of transmission lines passing \nthrough  reserve  forests  or  other  forestland  unless  the  required  forest  and  environmental \nclearances are obtained from the Government\u2019s Ministry of Forest and Environment. \n ", "19 \n80.  POWERGRID will use only PCB-free transformers for all the substations renovated \nand/or established under the Project.  \n \n81.  POWERGRID  will  install  oil  separators  (oil  traps)  in  all  outlets  of  the  sewers  of \nsubstations. The sludge of oil trapped by the separator will be kept in safe place (e.g. using \ndrums) within the property of the substation and will be sold only to the authorized third parties, \nin accordance with applicable laws and regulations of India. \n \n82.  POWERGRID, through its Environmental and Social Management Department (ESMD) \nwill  undertake  routine  monitoring  to  check  the  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures \nrecommended by the IEE (including the EMP with budget) for each subproject. \n \n6.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement  \n \n83.  POWERGRID will ensure that all land and rights-of way required by the subprojects will \nbe made available in a timely manner and that the provisions of the Resettlement Plan (RP) for \neach subproject as agreed with ADB (including any changes on account of detailed designs with \nprior approval of ADB), including compensation and entitlements for affected households and \npersons, will be implemented in accordance with the RP for each subproject, and in conformity \nwith all applicable laws and regulations of the Government, and ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement 1995 and the Resettlement Framework. \n   \n84.  POWERGRID will ensure that people affected by each subproject are consulted and \nfairly compensated in a timely manner in accordance with the related RPs, such that their living \nstandards are not adversely affected. POWERGRID will submit progress and completion reports \non land acquisition and resettlement under the quarterly progress reports for each subproject. \n \n85.  POWERGRID will ensure that prior to land acquisition and resettlement under each \nsubproject, the related RP including its update is disclosed with all necessary information made \navailable to persons affected by the subproject and confirm that it be posted on ADB web site. \nPOWERGRID will ensure that essential public infrastructure that may be affected under land \nacquisition and resettlement is replaced as appropriate in an expeditious manner in accordance \nwith the related RPs. As a condition for award of civil works contracts under each additional \nsubproject,  prior  to  such  award,  POWERGRID  will  have  disclosed  through  appropriate \nmeasures, the draft RP to persons affected by the subproject, and submitted the same to ADB \nfor review and obtained its approval. \n \n86.  The following principles shall apply under each subproject for the entitlements and \ncompensation of households and persons affected by the Program: (i) POWERGRID will ensure \nthat all compensation payments shall be made to affected households and persons prior to \ncommencement of civil works, in accordance with the related RP; and (ii) POWERGRID will \nensure  that  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  scheduled  tribes,  scheduled  castes,  vulnerable \nhouseholds, and female-headed  households  will  be  provided  with  additional  assistance  as \nprovided for in the entitlement matrix in the related RP.  \n \n87.  For  each  subproject,  POWERGRID  will  ensure  timely  provision  of  budget  for  land \nacquisition  and  other  activities  outlined  in  the  related  RP  and  will  meet  any  unforeseen \nobligations in excess of the RP budget estimate in order to satisfy the RP requirements. \n \n88.

As electricity is one of the key drivers for economic growth and poverty reduction, the \nGovernment has set the target of installing additional 100,000 megawatts (MW) of generation \ncapacity  to  provide  electricity access to all households by 2012 as stated in its National \nElectricity Policy. The total power generation capacity available to the grid was 112,000 MW as \nof 31 March 2004, consisting of 29,500 MW of hydro, 77,910 MW of thermal, 2,720 MW of \nnuclear, and 1,870 MW of wind. State electricity boards (SEBs) own 62% of the total installed \ncapacity, while the private and the central sector own 12% and 26%, respectively.  As of 31 \nMarch 2004, the peak power deficit was about 11% (9,510 MW) and energy deficit about 7% \n(39,870 gigawatt hours [GWh]).  The per capita electricity consumption stood at 567 kilowatt-\nhours  (kWh)  as  of  March  2003  with  about  84%  of  villages  but  only  about  31%  of  rural \nhouseholds electrified. Quality of power is poor, with frequent load shedding (rationing) and \nsignificant  voltage  fluctuation.  This  undermines  industry  competitiveness  and  severely \nconstrains  economic  growth.  The  power  system  comprises  five  interconnected  electrical \nregions, namely, northern, north eastern, eastern, western, and southern. Each electrical region \ncomprises interconnection of power systems of neighboring states. \n \n2.  The major portion of coal-based generation potential is in the states of Bihar and \nJharkhand in the eastern region, Madhya Pradesh/Chattisgarh in the western region; while \nhydro potential is in the states of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, and Kashmir, and Uttaranchal in \nthe northern region as well as Arunachal Pradesh in the northeastern region. Generating power \nat large pit-head generating stations and transmitting electricity to far-off load centers has more \nadvantages than transporting coal. To ensure reliable and secured delivery of power from \ngeneration projects to the end users, development of an adequate transmission system is vital. \n \nA.  Generation Capacity, Demand, and Deficit \n3.  The  current  installed  generation  capacity,  demand,  and  deficit  in  the  country  is \npresented in Table A1.1. \n \n      Table A1.1: Current Generation, Demand, and Deficit \n(megawatts) \nRegion  Installed  Peak   Peak   Surplus/ \nCapacity  Demand  Availability  Deficit \nNorthern  30,500  25,000  22,800  (2,200) \nWestern  32,700  29,800  24,000  (5,800) \nSouthern  30,500  22,500  21,000  (1,500) \nEastern  16,000  8,500  11,000  2,500 \nNortheastern  2,300  1,100  1,400   300 \nTotal  112,000  86,900  80,200  (6,700) \n  Source: Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. \n \n4.  Except for the eastern and northeastern regions, all the regions are presently facing \npower shortages in the range of about 1,500\u20136,000 MW. By the end of the 10th Plan, the \neastern and northeastern regions will have surplus power, while the northern, western, and \nsouthern regions will be in a deficit situation. Considering the generation addition program for \nthe next 5\u20136 years, the surplus power in the eastern and northeastern regions will be about \n10,000 MW and 300 MW, respectively; whereas the northern, western, and southern regions \nwill need to import power to a large extent from the eastern region to reduce their deficit \nsituation.

National Transmission Grid \n5.  At present, transmission links between the five regional grids are limited: Eastern and \nnortheastern regional grids are already operating in synchronous mode; northern, southern, and \nwestern  regions  have  been  operating  independently  with  interchanges  of  power  with \nneighboring regions on high voltage direct current, back-to-back asynchronous links or in radial \nmode on alternating current lines. Grid strengthening is urgently needed to facilitate export from \nthe surplus regions to the deficit regions. \n \n6.  The existing national transmission grid is hybrid in nature, comprising 400 kV and high \nvoltage direct current lines along with several 400 kV touch points spread over the entire \ncountry. Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) currently operates about \n48,000 circuit kilometers of extra-high voltage power transmission lines of 400 kV (existing 765 \nkV  lines  are  energized  at  400  kV)  and  82  extra-high  voltage  substations  with  a  total \ntransformation  capacity  of  about  46,500  megavolt-ampere.  The  capacity  of  interregional \ntransmission links is shown in Table A1.3. \n \nTable A1.3: Capacity of Inter-Regional Transmission Links \n(megawatts) \nBetween Regions  Existing Capacity   Capacity in 2012 \nEastern and Northern  650  12,350 \nEastern and Western  1,650  6,550 \nEastern and Southern  2,650  3,150 \nEastern and Northeastern  1,000  1,000 \nWestern and Northern  900  5,800 \nWestern and Southern  1,200  1,200 \nTotal  8,050  30,050 \n    Source: Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. \n \n7.  According to the least-cost generation expansion program and demand projection for \ndifferent regions, the eastern region would be the major power exporter for other regions. \nTherefore, development of strong interregional links interconnecting the eastern region to all \nother regions would be needed. By 2012, the eastern, western, and northern regions could be \ninterconnected  by  a  high  capacity  765  kV  ring,  while  the  southern  region  would  remain \ninterconnected in asynchronous mode. This would ultimately form the national transmission \ngrid. Table A1.3 shows the projected capacity of interregional transmission links in 2012. \n ", "  Appendix 1  23 \nC.  State Transmission and Distribution  \n8.  The  organization  of  the  power  sector  is  determined  by  the  country's  dual  political \nstructure, so that all major issues affecting the sector require concurrent action by the central \nand state governments. SEBs are under the administrative control of the respective state \nministry  of  power  or  department  of  power.  SEBs  now  account  for  approximately  80%  of \ncommercial electricity sales. However, most state governments use SEBs to provide low tariffs \nfor  agricultural  and  residential  consumers,  and  to  provide  employment  to  attract  political \nsupport. The consolidated rate of return on net fixed assets of SEBs has been negative and is \ndeteriorating rapidly due mainly to low agriculture tariff, low cost recovery, and high transmission \nand distribution (T&D) losses. \n \n9.  The world average T&D loss is about 10\u201315%, while India\u2019s T&D loss as of March 2003 \nwas about 33%. However, in the absence of adequate metering arrangements, especially for \nagricultural consumers, part of the losses were treated as agricultural consumption. The actual \nlosses are, therefore, thought to be much higher, with some SEBs now reporting T&D losses as \nhigh as 45\u201355%. The major reasons for such high  losses are pilferage of energy through \nunauthorized  connections  and  tampering  of  meters,  and  technical  losses  originating  from \noverloaded distribution networks. \n \n10.  The financial health of SEBs has become a matter of concern for central and state \ngovernments, considering that their losses have reached an alarming level of Rs330 billion, \nwhich is equivalent to about 1.5% of gross domestic product. The accumulation of outstanding \ndues to the central power utilities such as National Thermal Power Corporation, National Hydro \nPower Corporation, and POWERGRID has grown to over Rs400 billion. Thus, poor credit \nworthiness of SEBs has considerably slowed private sector investments, despite the central \nGovernment\u2019s  enabling  and  encouraging  framework.  Consequently,  the  Government  has \nformulated the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program to bring the reforms to \nthe distribution level with an overall objective of reducing T&D losses to 15%. The Ministry of \nPower has signed agreements with 24 states to expedite the process of reforms under program \nincentives. The agreements provide for metering of all 11 kV feeders, 100% metering of \nconsumers,  energy  audit,  reduction  of  T&D  losses,  and  attaining  commercial  viability  of \ndistribution. \n \n11.  SEBs will have to fund corresponding strengthening and expansion of their own state \ntransmission and distribution networks if they are to reap the full benefits of investments in \nadditional generation capacity, and strengthening and expansion of the national transmission \ngrid. Unless reforms are undertaken by SEBs in a timely manner to improve their financial \nsustainability, inadequate state transmission and distribution facilities may continue to constrain \neconomic growth and hamper electricity access to all households by 2012. \n \n12.  The  Energy  Conservation  Act  2001  gives  the  central  and  state  governments  the \nrequisite statutory powers to promote and enforce a progressive regime of energy conservation. \nThe 10th Plan targets energy saving of 95,000 GWh, mainly from the industry and agriculture \nsectors using energy efficient equipment.

POWERGRID derives income from the transmission of electricity and its primary source \nof revenue is transmission tariffs. In 2001, the Government transferred the transmission tariff \nsetting responsibility to Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC), which passed the \ncurrent tariff procedures with effect from 1 April 2004. POWERGRID now computes its tariff \nbased on full cost recovery of the loan capital (debt-equity of 70:30); depreciation (straight line); \nreturn on equity (14%); operation and maintenance expenses (based on fixed coefficient\u2014about \n$500 per circuit-km, and $65,000 per bay); and interest (based on short-term rates of the State \nBank of India) on working capital. State electricity boards (SEBs) are billed fixed monthly \navailability charges irrespective of the level of transmission capacity used.  \n \n3.  Until 2003, collection of accounts receivables from SEBs had been the major financial \nconcern for POWERGRID. Recognizing that rising past dues of SEBs to POWERGRID are no \nlonger sustainable, and restoration of financial viability of SEBs is essential, the Government \ndecided on a one-time settlement of outstanding SEB dues. In March 2003, by setting 30 \nSeptember 2001 as the cut-off date, the outstanding accounts receivable amounting to about \nRs12 billion was securitized by tax-free bonds issued by Reserve Bank of India with a 5-year \ngrace period paid semiannually. Currently outstanding accounts receivable are 2.4 months of \nthe equivalent sales. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 8  39 \nB.  Compliance with Current Loan Covenants \n4.  Two Asian Development Bank loans involving POWERGRID (footnote 5) have five major \ncovenants  (self-financing  ratio,  debt-equity  ratio,  debt  service  coverage  ratio,  outstanding \naccounts receivable, and negative pledge). With regard to these covenants POWERGRID has \ncomplied with the debt-equity ratio, while facing some issues with in compliance with others.  \n \n5.  POWERGRID is required to generate resources from internal sources amounting to at \nleast 20% of the average annual capital expenditure for the preceding, current, and succeeding \nfiscal year. POWERGRID\u2019s self-financing ratio fluctuated significantly between 1998/99 to 2003-\n2004 due to high investments that resulted in high amounts of assets under construction, low \ncash flows from operations because of slow payments from SEBs, and bonds structured with a \nsingle payment mechanism (100% of the principal paid in the year of maturity).  \n \n6.  POWERGRID is required to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.2 in all \nfuture years as defined in the Loan Agreement. The definition requires income from operations \nfor the immediately preceding fiscal year or the immediately preceding 12 months, before the \nproposed debt is to be considered as the base, while debt to be serviced would include \nobligations for all debt including the debt to be incurred. POWERGRID has generally been in \ncompliance with this covenant.  \n \n7.  The  Power  Transmission  (Sector)  Project  requires  POWERGRID  to  maintain  an \naggregate outstanding accounts receivable equal to the billing for the preceding 2 months. This \nwas not complied with as most SEBs were chronic defaulters and often ran arrears of up to 12 \nmonths.  Consequently,  the  covenant  was  revised  under  the  onging  Power  Transmission \nImprovement (Sector) Project to stipulate that, if the 60-day condition could not be complied \nwith, POWERGRID should hold irrevocable letters of credit for at least 65% of the average \nmonthly invoicing. POWERGRID has been complying with the revised covenant.  \n \n8.  The ongoing loan requires the Government to appoint at least three nongovernment \ndirectors to POWERGRID's board of directors. The Government has already commenced the \nprocess  of  appointing  the  replacement  directors.  The  Government  and  POWERGRID  are \nconscious of the need to act quickly as the nongovernment directors on the board are also a \nrequirement of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. \n \n9.  The two previous ADB loans (footnote 5) to POWERGRID have a negative pledge \ncovenant relating to its borrowings. The negative pledge clause under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility is only applicable to foreign currency borrowings. In order to maintain the existing \nrelationship with ADB, and not only secure but also deepen ADB\u2019s future involvement in its \ninvestment program, POWERGRID, in consultation with ADB, has taken action to obtain the \nconsent of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and Bank of India, \nCayman Islands to cede a pari passu charge so that the charge to be created in favor of ADB \nshall rank equally and ratably to their loans to secure the payment of principal of and interest \nand other charges on the two previous ADB loans. Given the steps needed to meet the negative \npledge requirement subsequent to the positive actions by POWERGRID, it is expected that \ncompletion of the process will be achieved by 30 June 2005. A Board Paper was circulated on \n19 November 2004 seeking waiver of the negative pledge covenant under the two previous \nloans to POWERGRID with respect to its domestic borrowings in order to harmonize the \nnegative pledge conditions in those two loans with the current LIBOR-based loan regulations. \nPOWERGRID has been operating profitably since its first year of commercial operations that \n ", "40  Appendix 8 \nended 31 March 1993. Since the commencement of ADB lending in 1996, POWERGRID has \nconsistently met all its debt service obligations.   \n \nC.  Financial Projections \n1.  General \n \n10.  Domestic inflation rates were assumed to be 4.8% through out the projections from year \nending 2003/04. The cumulative capital expenditure to be made by POWERRGRID during the \nimplementation of its NTDP amounts to Rs565 billion ($12.6 billion). The debt-equity ratio for \nADB-financed projects is considered as 70:30. For the NTDP, internal resources have been \nconsidered as 20% of capital investment until 2008/09 and 30% from 2009/10.  \n \n2.  Income Statement Assumptions \n \n11.  POWERGRID\u2019s revenue was projected using the transmission tariff procedures set by \nCERC.  Operation  and  maintenance  expenses  include  salaries  and  wages,  transmission \nexpenses, and depreciation. Salaries were computed on the basis of POWERGRID\u2019s current \nstaff size of 6,900 employees, remuneration on actual wage cost in 2002/03 and escalated by \n11% to reflect current wage setting practice. For administrative expenses, repairs, maintenance, \ninventories, the actual amount of 2002/03 was used and escalated by 11%. Depreciation was \ncomputed in line with the tariff norms as per the CERC guidelines at 2.91%. For existing loans, \ninterest expense was computed as per their loan schedules. The interest rate, moratorium \nperiod, and repayment period for balance domestic borrowings are 6.5%, 4 years, and 12 years, \nrespectively.  \n \n3.  Balance Sheet Assumptions \n \n12.  Accounts receivable represents 2.4 months of sales in 2003/04 and 3 months sales from \n2004/05 onward. Inventories were assumed as 1% of total assets. Accounts payable were \ncomputed  on  the  basis  of  monthly  electricity,  repairs,  maintenance,  administration,  and \nprocurement expenditures. Construction deposits are assumed to be 20% of construction in \nprogress and to be fully disbursed in the year following completion of construction in progress. \nInterest and dividends are assumed to be paid in the year following, whereas taxes will be paid \nin the year in which they occur. Principal repayments with respect to bonds, and foreign and \ndomestic debt were computed according to the terms and conditions of each facility. \n \n4.  Projected Financial Performance \n \n13.  POWERGRID\u2019s financial projections, as shown in Table 8.2, indicate profitability over \nthe term of the loan. The minimum debt-service coverage ratio is 1.33 in 2004/05, and the \nhighest  debt-equity  ratio  is  expected  to  be  69:31  in  2007/08,  2008/09  and  2009/10. \nPOWERGRID\u2019s assets under construction will increase significantly between years 2004/05 and \n2010/11  and  the  time  lag  for  these  assets  to  be  transferred  to  fixed  assets  for  revenue \ngeneration ranges from 14 to 18 months. The self-financing ratio is 7.3% in 2004/05, but \ngradually improves and reaches to 22.4% in 2008/09 and 30.0% in 2011/12. Despite an \nambitious capital expenditure program, POWERGRID should be able to maintain its financial \nviability over the term of the loan, and will remain profitable provided that its cost remains within \nthe margins established by the CERC tariff procedure. \n \n ", "        \nTable A8.2: Financial Projections\nAudited Audited Audited Provisional Forecast\nFiscal Year Ending 2000-2001 to 2009-2010 2000-2001 2001-2002 2002-2003 2003-2004 2004-2005 2005-2006 2006-2007 2007-2008 2008-2009 2009-2010\nIncome Statement Summary\n  Sales       26,826       24,555       25,327 28,054 31,325 36,161 43,254 53,018 63,698 76,791\n  Operating Cost       12,597       10,022       10,805 11,406 12,362 14,121 15,965 18,191 20,814 23,550\n  Operating Income/(Loss)       14,229       14,533       14,522 16,663 18,963 22,040 27,289 34,827 42,885 53,241\n  Net Income/(Loss) before Tax          8,123         7,953         7,518 8,095 8,021 9,031 11,713 16,226 20,979 26,630\n  Less: Income Tax            698            722            704 622 617 695 901 1,248 1,614 2,048\n        7,425         6,886         6,426 7,482 7,404 8,336 10,812 14,978 19,365 24,582\nCash Flow Summary\n  Net Cash Flow from Operating Activities       12,217       22,363       15,813        2 9,177       33,463       41,767      50,921     60,670     73,484     82,782\n  Net Cash Flow from Financing         7,148       11,524         8,369        3 0,235       35,252       51,033      62,164     64,743     76,408     70,639\n  Net Cash Used for Investing      (18,660)      (34,972)      (24,960)       ( 23,238)      (37,645)      (56,881)     (70,024)    (76,034)    (90,024)    (83,147)\n  Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivale  n  t       705        (1,085)           (778)        3 6,174       31,070       35,919      43,061     49,378     59,868     70,274\nBalance Sheet Summary\n  Fixed Assets       97,844       99,059     145,987 187,599 221,558 271,617 319,044 385,928 465,202 535,998\n  Current Assets       57,982       90,562       64,444 47,759 44,988 51,472 71,701 80,265 92,845 106,316\n  Total Assets     155,826     189,621     210,431      2 35,358     266,546     323,089    390,746   466,194   558,047   642,314\n  Current Liabilities         9,148       15,833       13,982 28,083 30,721 40,484 49,457 59,029 76,083 91,373\n  Long-Term Debt       80,622       99,235     114,432 122,664 147,612 183,279 229,499 279,115 334,786 380,420\n  Total Equity       62,471       67,571       73,124 81,191 88,213 99,326 111,790 128,050 147,178 170,521\n  Total Liabilities and Equity     152,241     182,639     201,538      2 35,358     266,546     323,089    390,746   466,194   558,047   642,314\nKey Performance Indicators\n  Debt Service Coverage Ratio (Times) 1.49 1.08 1.59 1.51 1.33 1.32 1.38 1.56 1.68 1.55\n  Self-Financing Ratio (%) 33.6 0.0 37.5 22.20 6.8 11.6 12.5 14.9 22.0 17.5\n  Return on Average Net Fixed Assets (%) 7.6 7.0 4.4 5.0 4.5 4.3 4.8 5.6 6.2 6.8\n  Long-Term Debt to Equity Ratio 56:44 59:41 64:36 62:38 63.37 65:35 67:33 69:31 69:31 69:31\nSource: Power Grid Corporation of India Limited and Asian Development Bank estimates.\nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 8\n \n4\n1\n ", "                   4\n2\n \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 9\n \nSUBPROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE\nS No. Subproject Name 2004 2005 2006 2007\n7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1112\nCore Subprojects\nTF TO CA DA CS CE ES EE C\nI.

In accordance with the sector lending procedure of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), three core \nsubprojects identified in the southern regional grid involve setting up of five new substations in two states of Andhra \nPradesh and Tamil Nadu, and one Union Territory of Pondicherry. The Project, by focusing on strengthening and \nexpansion of the transmission systems of the Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) is expected to \nreduce system losses, which in turn will improve frequency and voltage levels, and ultimately reduce wear on \nelectrical equipment. This will lead to more efficient use of resources and make more power available to increase \nelectrification outreach. In addition, it will facilitate efficient utilization of existing and planned power plants. The \nstrengthening of the sector in the selected states will result in efficient delivery of services to consumers. Profitability \nand efficiency in the farm and nonfarm sector is expected to improve with improvements in quality and reliability of \npower supply with effective restructuring. For the poor, wage employment opportunities and farm profitability and \nhousehold welfare will improve.  \n \nB.         Poverty Analysis                                                   Targeting Classification: General intervention     \n \nThe three core subprojects cover five districts in the two states of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, and Union \nTerritory of Pondicherry. These states are among the better-off states in the country in terms of per capita income, \neconomic growth, and human and social development. In case of Andhra Pradesh, the National Human Development \nReport (2001) ranks the state as 10th among 15 states calculated. Poverty is still a pertinent problem in the state with \n15.77% of the state population living below the poverty line (1999/00) compared with national data of 26.10%. The \nstate of Tamil Nadu, on the other hand, is country's 6th most populous state, and was ranked it 3rd out of 15 states \ncalculated. In general, the state has been successful in its overall efforts to address poverty, and the proportion of \nthose living below the poverty line fell from over 35.03% in 1993/94 to 21.12% in 1999/00. The state ranks 12th in \nhuman poverty index ranking for the country.  \n \nPoverty levels in the Union Territory of Pondicherry were estimated at 37.40%( 1993/94) and 21.67% (1999/00). In all \nthe three states, poverty levels are now largely lower than the national average. However, in spite of this impressive \nperformance, poverty remains pervasive with a large section of the population (scheduled castes/tribes, minorities, \nwomen) not benefiting from the economic and social development. \n \nThe Project is expected to result in efficient delivery of services to consumers. The improved frequency and voltage as \nwill boost the industry and agriculture sectors leading to enhanced production, and improved economic development.  \n \n \nC.         Participation Process   \n \nDuring project preparation, a total of 10 consultations and meetings with the project communities in the five subproject \ndistricts were organized. Discussions aimed at ascertaining community response to the subprojects, their needs and \ndemands from the subprojects, an estimate of losses that they would suffer, and steps to mitigate those losses. These \nmeetings were held in groups comprising village panchayats, village administrative officers, men, women, farmers, \nand disadvantaged groups to ensure a comprehensive perspective on the Project and its impacts. \n \n \nD.  Gender and Development  \n \nBased on the premise that no development activity can be gender neutral and potentially affects women, gender \nparticipation was ensured during the course of the social study by means of focus group discussions with women to \nascertain the impact of the subprojects on them. The interactions revealed that women as a group perceived no direct \nbenefit or impacts from the subprojects. However, they established a clear linkage in terms of the future indirect \nbenefits that should boost industrial development and agricultural production (by making available options of irrigation \nsources through mechanization) and thereby leading to socioeconomic development of their community and area.  \n ", "46  Appendix 11 \n \nE.

Core Subproject Description and Area  \n \n1.  The three core subprojects of the Power Grid Transmission (Sector) Project involve the \nstrengthening of the southern regional grid covering Andhra Pradesh, Pondicherry, and Tamil \nNadu.  The  three  core  subprojects  cover  five  rural  villages  in  the  districts  of  Warangal, \nTriunelveli, Karur, Coimbatore, and Pondicherry. The majority of households depend upon \nagriculture and agricultural labor for livelihood. \n \nB.  Scope of Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n \n2.  The three core subprojects include construction of five new substations and will involve \nland acquisition. The land has been identified in each of the subproject locations (Table A12.1). \nTechnical design for the proposed five substations has been adjusted to avoid or to minimize \nimpacts, especially homestead land and houses. Field visits and public consultations helped to \ndevelop the measures to minimize negative social impacts. These substations will directly \nbenefit the core subproject areas and contribute to ensuring better power supply and voltage \nregulation for the overall development of the communities. \n \nTable A12.1: Summary of Core Subproject Impacts \n \n        Number of   \n  State/Union  Name of New  Village and  Affected  Land Loss \nSubproject  Territory  Substation   District  Households  (in acres) \nGrid  Tamil Nadu  400/220 kV at  Abishegapatti     \nStrengthening  Triunelveli   Village in  41a  69 \nfor TN\u2013I   Triunelveli District  \nGrid  Tamil Nadu  400/220 kV  K.

An estimated total of 186 acres of land will be acquired for the construction of the three \ncore subprojects thereby affecting an estimated 132 households comprising 42 titleholders and \n40 households with users\u2019 rights but no formal titles. Of the 186 acres, 19 are government land, \n98  comprise  private  land,  and  the  remaining  69  belong  to  Tamil  Nadu  Hindu  Religious \nEndowment Board as the titleholder. These 69 acres are used by an estimated 40 households \n ", "48  Appendix 12 \nof  Abishegapatti  Village  (Triunelveli)  for  cultivation.  These  households  will  be  entitled  to \nrehabilitation assistance in the form of an income-generating scheme. \n \n4.  In addition, the land acquisition for substation construction in Karmatthapuram Village in \nArasur (Tamil Nadu) will adversely affect a temple and partially affect a pond used by villagers \nfor sanitation purposes. The community sanitation pond and temple will be reconstructed in a \nsuitable location in consultation with those affected. The land acquisition will not adversely affect \nany commercial or residential structures.  \n \nC.  Scope of the Resettlement Plan and Framework \n \n5.  A  full  resettlement  plan  (RP)  was  prepared  for  the  three  core  subprojects  and  is \npresented as Supplementary Appendix J. The total estimated resettlement budget for the three \ncore subprojects RP implementation is about Rs71.3 million. The estimate includes all the cost \nrelated to land acquisition, compensation, resettlement assistance, monitoring and evaluation, \nand administrative costs. The budget is based on field-level information and past experience in \nresettlement  management.  To  guide  preparation  of  the  RPs  for  additional  subprojects,  a \nresettlement framework was prepared (Supplementary Appendix C). \n \nD.  Policy Framework and Entitlement \n  \n6.  The policy framework and entitlements of the Project are based on the Land Acquisition \nAmendment Act of 1984, and associated regulations, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ninvoluntary resettlement policy (1995) and Handbook on Resettlement (1998), the Power Grid \nCorporation of India Limited (POWERGRID) social and environmental policy and guidelines \n(2004),  and  the  entitlement  benefits  as  listed  in  the  National  Policy  on  Resettlement and \nRehabilitation of India as notified in February 2004.

A  grievance  redress  committee  will  be  set  up  by  the  Environment  and  Social \nManagement Unit of POWERGRID in each of the subproject locations to address all concerns \nand grievances of the local communities and people affected. The committee will be established \n ", "  Appendix 12  51 \n2 months prior to the commencement of civil works for additional subprojects, and will comprise \nPOWERGRID, representatives of local authorities, people affected, village panchayat, and well-\nreputed representatives of the health and education sectors as mutually agreed with the local \nauthorities and people affected. The committee will address project-related grievances and will \nprovide a public forum for concerns or objections regarding the assistance. POWERGRID will \nbe represented by a senior official from the regional/corporate center. The grievance redress \ncommittee will be locally located and functional to ensure easy access to communities and \npeople affected. POWERGRID will disseminate information about the functional norms of the \ncommittees, which will meet at least twice a year or as and when required. \n \nF.   Institutional Arrangement and Budget  \n \n10.  POWERGRID will be the Executing Agency for the Project. A social, resettlement, and \nenvironment  implementation  unit  will  be  established  for  each  subproject,  headed  by  a \nconcerned  senior  official  of  the  region.  The  unit  will  be  accountable  and  responsible  for \nimplementation of the RP. Each unit will have one or more resettlement officer depending on \nnumber of people affected to implement. These resettlement officers should have an academic \nbackground  of  social  sciences  with  field  experience  handling  RP  implementation  and \ncommunity-based  activities.  The  unit  will  maintain  all  databases,  work  closely  with  those \naffected and target community and community based organizations. \n \n11.  The social, resettlement, and environment implementation units will be responsible for \ninternal monitoring and will prepare progress reports on RP implementation. RPs must be \nimplemented and completed within 12 months, effective from the commencement of civil works. \nPOWERGRID will ensure that all compensation payments shall be made to affected households \nand persons prior to commencement of civil works.  \n12.  The total estimated resettlement budget for each subproject RP should be stated. The \nestimate includes all the cost related to land acquisition, compensation, resettlement assistance, \nmonitoring  and  evaluation,  and  administrative  costs.  The  budget  will  be  based  on  field \ninformation and past experience with resettlement management.  \n \nG.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  The RP will have both internal and external monitoring.

An \nindependent expert will be hired by the POWERGRID with ADB concurrence for undertaking \nexternal monitoring of each subproject within 3 months of loan effectiveness for the core \nsubprojects, and at least 2 months prior to commencement of civil works under each additional \nsubproject. Such expert will report on a 6 monthly basis directly to ADB and POWERGRID and \ndetermine  whether  resettlement  goals  have  been  achieved,  more  importantly  whether \nlivelihoods and living standards have been restored, and suggest suitable recommendations for \nimprovement.  \n \n ", "52  Appendix 13 \nENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.   Introduction \n \n1.  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited  (POWERGRID)  prepared  an  initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) and a summary IEE  (Supplementary Appendix D) for the \nPower Grid  Transmission (Sector) Project. The Project is assigned environment category B. \nIEEs  and  environmental  management  plans  (EMPs)  with  implementation  budgets  were \nprepared for the three core subprojects, comprising six transmission line segments and nine \nsubstations (five new and four to be augmented) by POWERGRID. The IEE and its summary for \nthe entire Project was prepared following the  Asian Development Bank (ADB)  Environment \nPolicy  2002  and  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines  2003,  and  Government  of  India \nenvironmental assessment guidelines and regulations.  \n \n2.  Environmental  Assessment  and  Review  Framework  for  Subproject  Selection  (the \nEnvironmental Framework) has been defined as required by ADB guidelines for sector lending \nand  Government  requirements  for  transmission  projects  (see  Section  C,  below).  The \nEnvironmental  Framework  (Supplementary  Appendix  E)  identifies  the  broad  scope  of  the \nProject and outlines the policy, procedures and institutional requirements for core subproject \nselection and preparation of subsequent sub-projects. Consistent with ADB procedures and \nPOWERGRID  environmental  management  system,  the  Environmental  Framework  and \nenvironmental management procedural guidelines will apply to all subprojects under the loan to \nensure  that  the  environmental  issues  are  appropriately  addressed  and  any  impacts  are \nadequately mitigated.  \n \nB.   Description of the Project \n \n3.  The Project is a sector loan to strengthen and develop India\u2019s national transmission grid, \nthrough intra- and interregional high capacity transmission development, including operation \nand maintenance services, without causing any major environmental and social problems. The \nthree core subprojects will strengthen the high voltage transmission system in the southern \nregional grid covering the regional and state grids of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil \nNadu, and Union Territory of Pondicherry. This southern region strengthening component of the \nProject will improve reliability and security in this region and transmit additional power within the \nregion by improving existing grid interconnections. The proposed southern transmission system \nwould fulfill high capacity transmission requirements of the region. A description of the three \ncore subprojects is summarized in Table A13.1. \n \nC.   Environmental Assessment and Review Framework for Subproject Selection \n \n4.  The following criteria have been and will be applied to selection of subprojects, including \ncore and future subprojects. All subprojects require an IEE, in accordance with ADB policy and \nguidelines  (para.  1).  The  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forests  does  not  require  a  full \nenvironmental impact assessment for transmission line projects. However, for transmission lines \ntraversing forests,1 the project executing agency is required to obtain forest clearance from the \n                                                 \n1  The Indian Forest Act, 1927 regulates the classification and declaration of different categories of forests. The state \ngovernment may constitute any forestland or wasteland, which is the property of Government or over which the \nGovernment has proprietary rights, or to the whole or any part of the forest-produce of which the Government is \nentitled, a reserved forest, or protected forest in the manner provided in the act. A reserved forest usually has good \nquality of woods with limited rights of inhabitants until clearances are obtained. A protected forest is usually near \n ", "  Appendix 13  53 \nMinistry of Environment and Forests. Potential adverse environmental impacts associated with \ntransmission lines and substations can be avoided or minimized through careful route and site \nselection. Preliminary site selection is based on the topographic sheets of the Survey of India \nand Forest Atlas.2 \n \nTable 13.1: Core Subprojects \n \nComponent \nTransmission Lines  Substations \nLocation \nTamil Nadu-I  Tirunelveli-Udumalpet 400kV D/C,  New 400/220 kV substation at \n  294 kilometers (km)  Tirunelveli \n   \nLILO of Madurai- Trivandrum 400kV  Augmentation of 400/220 kV \nD/C at Tirunelveli, 51 km  substations at Udumalpet and \nTrivandrum \n \nTamil Nadu-II  Pugalur-Madurai 400kV D/C , 160 km  New  400/220  kV  Substation  at \n  Arasur and Pugalur \n   \nUdumalpet-Arasur 400kV D/C TL, 42  New associated bays at Madurai \nkm  and Udumalpet substations \n   \nGrid strengthening for  LILO  of  Ramagundam-Khammam  New 400/220 kV and 400/220 kV \nTamil Nadu, Andhra  400kV D/C line at Warangal, 14 km  substations  at  Warangal  and \nPradesh, and Union    Pondicherry \nTerritory of  LILO of Neyveli-Sriperumbudur 400kV \nPondicherry  D/C line at Pondicherry, 11 km \n \n           D/C = double circuit, km = kilometer, kV = kilovolt, LILO = loop-in-loop-out, TL = transmission line.  \n           Source: Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. \n \n5.  The following are the specific environmental criteria for subproject selection:  \n \n(i)  The transmission lines and substations will not be located within or cross areas \nof virgin forests, ecologically significant or environmentally sensitive areas such \nas national parks, nature reserves, or wetland as designated by the Ministry of \nEnvironment and Forests, Government of India.  \n(ii)  Potential environmental impacts associated with initial alignments and locations \nare minimized by realignment or selection of alternative sites.  \n(iii)  Monuments of cultural or historical importance will be avoided. \n(iv)  Clearing of any existing forest resources will be avoided if possible, and where \nunavoidable will be minimized and compensated according to India regulatory \ncriteria. \n(v)  An EMP with adequate budget will be developed for each subproject. \n(vi)  Environment category A subprojects will not be included in the Project. \n(vii)  Environment category \u201cB Sensitive\u201d subprojects will be avoided to the extent \npossible. All additional subprojects will be subject to ADB classification, and any \nsubprojects deemed \u201csensitive\u201d will require justification and documentation that \nanticipated impacts can be effectively mitigated.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \nvillages or human settlements where people are entitled to the existing forest activities, such as fuelwood collection \nand grazing. Clearance procedures for development activities in both forests are the same. \n2  Government of India. 1976. Survey of India Forest Atlas. Delhi. \n ", "54  Appendix 13 \n1.   Application of Subproject Selection Criteria and Preparation of the Initial \nEnvironmental Examination \n \n6.  Additional subprojects not meeting the criteria (para. 5) will be rejected. A final check on \nconformity with the selection criteria will be the submission of a detailed IEE for additional \nsubprojects for ADB clearance. An environmental categorization process using a checklist \napproach in compliance with the ADB Environment Policy 2002 will be applied. Any additional \nsubproject confirmed by ADB as environmentally sensitive will require that the summary IEE be \nmade available to general public at least 120 days before subproject approval by ADB. \n \n7.  During subproject selection and preparation of the IEE, at least one public consultation \nwill be conducted with local community and potentially affected people for each subproject. The \nIEE  will  be  approved  before  commencement  of  detailed  design:  IEE  results  will  be \ncommunicated to the local community before commencement of construction.  \n \n2.   Responsibilities and Authority of Various Agencies \n \n8.  POWERGRID will be solely responsible for implementation of the entire environmental \nassessment and review procedures of selecting additional subprojects. This includes ensuring \nthat the selection criteria are strictly followed, IEEs (including EMPs with budgets) and summary \nIEEs are prepared in a timely and adequate manner, environmental monitoring and institutional \nrequirements are fully met, and public consultations be carried out satisfactorily. POWERGRID \nwill submit the categorization checklist and IEEs and summary IEEs and monitoring reports to \nADB for review. \n \n9.  ADB will be responsible for regular review and timely approval of subproject checklists \nand IEEs and summary IEEs. ADB will provide technical guidance to POWERGRID if needed. \nADB will also be responsible for reviewing regular monitoring reports and officially disclosing the \nIEEs for selected subprojects on its website.  \n \n3.   Detailed Design and Construction Contracts \n \n10.  Detailed design work for each additional subproject will follow the recommendations of \nthe IEE. The Environmental and Social Management Department of POWERGRID will vet \ndetailed designs before contracts are finalized and modifications are incorporated if considered \nnecessary. Certification to ADB that the detailed designs comply with IEE (including EMP) \nrecommendations will be required before contracts can be made effective.  \n \n11.  Early  in  the  implementation  period,  model  construction  contracts  will  be  prepared \nincorporating general environmental safeguards and practices. Specific, individual contracts will \nbe based on the model contracts, but evaluated by the Environmental and Social Management \nDepartment of POWERGRID to ensure that any special or particular safeguard recommended \nby the IEE (including EMP) for the subproject is incorporated within the contract. \n \nD.  Anticipated Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n12.  Table A13.2  summarizes the anticipated impacts during construction and operation. \nAlignment selection during the design stage has avoided major impacts. The Project will occupy \nunutilized wasteland, agricultural land, and grazing land.

POWERGRID \nwill submit a monitoring report twice a year to ADB. An independent expert will be hired by the \nPOWERGRID with ADB concurrence for undertaking external monitoring of each subproject \nwithin 3 months of loan effectiveness for the core subprojects, and at least 2 months prior to \ncommencement of civil works under each additional subproject. Such expert will report on a 6 \nmonthly basis directly to ADB and POWERGRID and determine whether sound environmental \nmanagement  practices  have  been  achieved,  and  suggest  suitable  recommendations  and \nremedial measures for midterm correction and improvement. \n \nI.   Conclusion \n \n18.  The Project will have minimal negative environmental impacts that can be successfully \nmitigated by implementing the subproject-specific EMPs. The Environmental Framework and \nEMPs  are  adequate  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  and  Government  environmental \nsafeguards. Based on the IEEs conducted to date, no full environmental impact assessment is \nrequired. \n                                                 \n3 POWERGRID has successfully completed two ADB-funded projects with satisfactory safeguard compliance. \n ", "58  Appendix 14 \nSUMMARY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The economic and financial analysis is based on a time-slice approach of the National \nTransmission  Development  Plan  (NTDP)  of  Power  Grid  Corporation  of  India  Limited \n(POWERGRID) as individual subprojects are not stand-alone investments and would not yield \nbenefits if considered in isolation. The economic internal rate of return compares the annual \nstreams of economic capital and operating costs against benefits based on willingness to pay. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) compares the annual streams of financial capital and \noperating costs against revenues. All costs, benefits, and revenues are expressed in 2004 \nconstant prices. The analysis period includes the construction period and 20 years of operation. \nDetails on the assumptions and calculations used for the economic and financial analysis are \npresented in Supplementary Appendices K and L, respectively. \n \nB.  Economic Analysis \n \n2.  The main benefits stems from (i) removing existing bottlenecks to meet the growing \nenergy needs by introducing economic dispatch  between neighboring regions; (ii) improving \nefficiency reliability and system security; (iii) facilitating energy trade from surplus to deficit \nregions; and (iv) reducing losses. The physical output\u2014interstate transmission of electricity\u2014\nwill  add  to  existing  supply  (incremental  benefit)  and  will  substitute  (nonincremental)  for \nalternative forms of energy supply. The incremental benefit of the interregional link of 22,000 \nmegawatts (MW) is about 102,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity transmission at 60% load \nfactor. The incremental benefits were valued for each category of customers, using customers\u2019 \nwillingness to pay for electricity. \n \n3.  The nonincremental benefit was quantified using the alternative energy resources used \nin the without-project scenario. The 16,000 MW of demand not met (23,500 GWh assuming 4 \nhours of load-shedding [rationing] each day) in the deficit regions are valued at the cost of \nalternative energy sources\u2014kerosene, lamp, diesel irrigation pump, and diesel generation\u2014for \nrespective customer class. The nonincremental benefits were divided to customer categories \nusing  the  approximate  pattern  of  load-shedding  by  the  customer  class:  domestic  (55%), \ncommercial (10%), industrial (20%), and agriculture (15%). \n \n  1.  Calculation of Willingness to Pay \n \n4.  The value of each unit of electricity to customers was estimated by comparing current \nprices against the price of alternative sources of electricity. Particular consumer classes are \nassumed to be willing to pay the difference between the present cost for an alternative source of \nelectricity and the amount that charged for incremental grid-supplied units. This was used as the \nbasis for the willingness-to-pay calculation. Focusing on the consumer class, the analysis \nidentified focused at the consumer class level and four classed of electricity consumer types\u2013\nagricultural, residential, commercial, and industrial were analysed. The focus is on the main \nenergy  use  (and  the  alternative  source) rather than full range of appliances used by the \ncustomer category to calculate the real value for lost load.

Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n5.  The base case real economic internal rate of return is 30.5%. The time-slice analysis \ninvolved time-series data over 2002-2012, equivalent to 10 annual observations. The data for \nincremental cost of distribution, generation, and load factor was obtained from POWERGRID \nand the annual reports of the Planning Commission, Government of India. \n \nTable 14.2: Sensitivity Analysis \n \nSensitivity Analysis of EIRR     Change in Variable  NPV 2004  EIRR \n            (%)  ($ million)  (%) \nBase Case             22,350   30.5\n(i) Capital Cost Overrun    10     21,735   29.5\n(ii) Energy Sales Reduction    (20)     16,615   28.1\n(iii) Steel Price Increase    50     21,334   28.9\n(v) Willingness-to-Pay Decrease  (20)     14,584   25.2\n(iv) Combination of (i), (ii), and (v)          9,832   22.1\nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, NPV = net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nC.  Financial Analysis \n \n6.  The financial viability of  the overall investment program during 2002\u20132012 when the \nsubprojects will be financed under the sector loan was assessed. The weighted average cost of \ncapital  (WACC)  is  also  calculated  for  the  overall  investment  program  to  be  financed  by \nPOWERGRID and was  compared with the FIRR to ascertain the financial viability of the \ninvestment project. \n \n  1.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n7.  To compute the WACC, the financing sources are assumed to comprise POWERGRID\u2019s \nequity contribution financed through retained earnings, government funding, and a combination \nof foreign exchange and local currency loans. Based on the expectations and POWERGRID\u2019s \nhistorical cost of borrowing, the loans earmarked for POWERGRID are assumed to carry \ndifferent nominal interest rates. The cost of POWERGRID\u2019s equity is calculated at 14% as \nallowed by Central Electricity Regulatory Commission tariff norms for pass through. The other \nassumptions are domestic inflation rate of 4.8%, international interest rate of 6.7%, and tax rate \nof 7.5%. For foreign-sourced loans, the Asian Development Bank requires that a premium for \nforeign exchange risk be included in the WACC. To simplify the WACC calculation, assumed \n ", "60  Appendix 14 \nthe foreign exchange risk premium is assumed to offset the prevailing foreign inflation rate. As \nshown in Table A14.2, the WACC for the investment program during 2002\u20132012 is 4.5%. \n \nTable A14.3: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \n  Foreign   Domestic    Government  \n Item  Loans  Loans  Equity  Funding  Total \nAmount (Rs million)  136,022  302,378  116,600  10,000  565,000 \nWeighting (%)  24.1  53.5  20.6  1.8   \nNominal Cost (%)  6.7  8.0  14.0  11.0   \nTax Rate (%)  7.5  7.5  7.5  7.5   \nTax-Adjusted Nominal Cost (%)  6.2  7.4  13.0  10.2   \nInflation Rate (%)    4.8  4.8  4.8   \nReal Cost (%)  6.2  2.4  7.8  5.1   \nWACC (%)  1.5  1.3  1.6  0.1  4.5 \nRs = Indian rupees, WACC = weighted average cost of capital. \nSource: Asiand Development Bank and Power Grid Corporation of India Limited. \n \n  2.
