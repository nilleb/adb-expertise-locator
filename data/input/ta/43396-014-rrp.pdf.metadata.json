I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based  loan  to  the  Republic  of  the  Philippines  for  subprogram  2  of  the  Increasing \nCompetitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program.1 \n \n2.  The program supports the government\u2019s key reform priorities aimed at employment \ngeneration by increasing competitiveness in the economy with an inclusive approach through \nthe labor market. The structural reform priorities include efforts to enhance the business climate \nby promoting competition policy, regulatory efficiency, competitive logistics, and private sector \nparticipation in infrastructure projects through public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). The program \nalso  supports  the  government  in  promoting  competitive  labor  markets  by  piloting  a  youth \nemployment  program  to  empower  young  people  to  find  decent  jobs  (known  as  JobStart \nPhilippines) and a tourism-industry-led skills and services development program, and through \nlonger-term labor policy reforms. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The government has made employment creation the core of its inclusive growth strategy \nand has updated the Philippine Development Plan (PDP), 2011\u20132016 to this effect. Investment \nin education, infrastructure, and improvements to the investment climate to attract investment \nand create jobs are the top priorities of the economic program. \n \n4.  Job creation. From 2010 to 2014, the Philippine economy enjoyed its fastest expansion \nsince the 1970s. Economic growth has averaged 6.5% per annum, well above its long-term \ntrend of 5.0%. This sustained growth is becoming manifest in a modest improvement in job \ncreation. Since 2010, full-time wage jobs\u2014a broad measure of decent jobs\u2014have expanded by \n3.7% per annum, slightly up from the average 3.4% during 1991\u20132010. According to the Bureau \nof Labor Statistics survey of the largest 1,000 corporations in the Philippines, new hires have \nexpanded by 10.0% per annum since 2011, doubling from a longer-term average of 5.0% per \nannum. While wage-job creation has picked up since 2010, it has not been sufficient to absorb \nall new job seekers or make a dent in the number of workers crowded into the nonwage or \ninformal  employment  sector  (i.e.,  self-employed,  private  households,  and  unpaid  family \nworkers), of which the latter account for over half of the workforce. \n \n5.  High rate of youth not in employment, education, or training. Youth unemployment \nrates provide limited information on the situation of out-of-work young people because they \nexclude those economically inactive. A more informative measure is the  number of young \npeople \u201cnot in employment, education, or training\u201d (NEET). The NEET rate includes unemployed \nyouth and those staying at home. There is concern that repeated spells outside the labor market \nwithout  training  and  for  longer  periods  can  be  damaging  to  young  people\u2019s  future  career \nprospects and earnings. It can also perpetuate lifetime poverty for the young residing in poor \nhouseholds. The youth NEET rate in the Philippines is relatively high on a comparison with its \nmiddle-income peers. For example, the Philippines\u2019 youth NEET rate (at 25.0% of the youth \npopulation) is the second highest behind Indonesia in Southeast Asia and above the rates \ncalculated for the larger Latin American economies of Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico, which all \nhave youth unemployment problems. In the Philippines, more than one-third of young women \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "2 \nA\nfall into the NEET category, compared with one in five men. Of particular concern is that the  p\np\nyouth NEET rate is twice as high in low-income families than in high-income families, indicating  en\nd\na large pool of young people from lower-income families not being integrated into the labor  ix\n 4\nmarket despite the recent economic expansion. It reflects both insufficient growth in the demand   \nfor labor and a serious mismatch of technical and life skills in this demographic group. Thus, \nwhile sustained economic growth above 6.5% per annum is necessary to generate jobs, it is  2\n \ninsufficient. Structural policy reforms, including to the labor market, and effectively targeted \npublic provisioning of employment services to assist at-risk young people from lower-income \nhouseholds in finding jobs are necessary to reduce the youth NEET rate. \n \n6.  Investment rate. Supporting the pickup in economic growth has been a solid recovery in \nprivate and public investment. The fixed investment rate started to decline after the Asian \nfinancial  crisis  of  1997  and  bottomed  out  at 13.5%  of gross  domestic  product  in  2005. It \nrecovered to 16.8% of gross domestic product by 2008 and reached 19.4% by 2012. Still, the \nfixed investment rate in the Philippines is much lower than in most other Southeast Asian \neconomies, such as Indonesia (33.2%), Malaysia (25.7%), and Thailand (28.5%). It has resulted \nin  lower  long-term  economic  growth  potential  of  around  5.0%  per  annum.  Much  higher \ninvestment is necessary to sustain the current average growth rate of 6.5% per annum. In \nparticular, the Philippines continues to underinvest in infrastructure. \n \n7.  Competitiveness.  There  has  been  a  marked  improvement  in  the  rankings  of  the \nPhilippines in key global competitiveness surveys since 2010, indicating significantly improved \nperceptions about the investment climate and the government\u2019s reform efforts. For example, \ncompared with 2013, the Philippines jumped six places in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2014 \nGlobal Competitiveness Index to become 59th out of 148 countries. Still more needs to be done. \nThe global competitiveness reports identified common areas for the government\u2019s attention, \nsuch as reforms to the labor market, investment regime, business regulations, and the finance \nsector. Continued improvements in competitiveness in these areas would establish a solid \nplatform for attracting investment and job creation.2 \n \n8.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132016 for the \nPhilippines is consistent and aligned with the PDP and its recent midterm review.3 It has set \nexpansion in investment as an outcome indicator. ADB has extensive experience in helping \nimprove the investment climate in the Philippines, including assistance to the energy sector, \ncapital market development, road infrastructure, and the business climate (footnote 2). \n \n9.  The Increasing Competitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program takes a programmatic \napproach.4 It has two subprograms enveloped by a medium-term results-based framework. \nSubprogram  1  was  approved  by  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors  in  June  2012  (footnote  4). \nSubprogram 2 builds on the reforms under subprogram 1, with the main focus on implementing \npolicy reforms through pilot projects to demonstrate reform impact. The program has three \noutputs seen as critical for raising competitiveness and promoting labor market inclusiveness: (i) \nimplementing structural policy reforms to the economy through a better competition policy, \nregulatory  efficiency,  and  competitive  trade  logistics;  (ii)  strengthening  the  market  for \ninfrastructure projects through PPPs; and (iii) promoting competitive labor markets to overcome \n                                                \n2  Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management\u2013Investment Climate (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n3  ADB. 2011.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nstructural weaknesses and generate employment. The program includes a set of high-impact \nstructural  policy  reforms  (such  as  competition  policy,  regulatory  reform,  and  tax  reform) \ndesigned to potentially benefit all sectors. It also includes a package of deeper structural policy \nreforms and assistance to specific leading sectors such as tourism, logistics, and infrastructure. \nThe tourism sector was selected at the onset of the program in response to private sector \ndemand for structural reforms to specific sectors that hold promise for further lifting economic \ngrowth and job creation in an inclusive manner.5 \n \n10.  Subprogram 2 includes two innovative pilot projects that apply policy in practice, with \nclearly defined and measurable performance indicators. The two pilot projects are supported by \ntwo ADB technical assistance (TA) projects financed by the Government of Canada to the \namount of Can$12.5 million.6 Each pilot project is subject to an impact evaluation to provide \nevidence prior to a nationwide rollout of these programs. The first intervention is the youth \nemployment program known as JobStart Philippines. Drawing on successful models in Latin \nAmerica, Canada, and Europe, JobStart provides job placement assistance to young people. \nJobStart is currently being piloted in four local government units and helps 1,600 out-of-school \nyouths to find quality jobs. The second innovative intervention is the tourism skills development \nprogram, a PPP between the Department of Tourism (DOT), employers, and industry groups, \nand is being piloted in Bohol, Cebu, Davao, and Palawan, which are fast-growing tourism \ndestinations.  The  tourism  skills  development  program  includes  a  grants  scheme  whereby \nemployers can avail of grants to train workers so as to upgrade skills and services. \n \n11.  Subprogram 2 has been jointly formulated by the Government of the Philippines and \nADB, with input into outputs 1 and 2 of the policy matrix from the Government of Japan and \ninputs into output 3 by the Government of Canada. The government, through the Department of \nFinance  (DOF),  has  coordinated  the  reform  agenda  with  other  development  partners \nparticipating in the program policy forum (the governments of Canada, France, and Japan) \nthrough the program steering committee.7 \n \n12.  During implementation of subprogram 2, the government and ADB agreed to shift two \noriginal policy triggers to the post-program partnership framework (P3F) (para. 30) without \nmaterially affecting the program\u2019s impact and outcome. One new policy trigger was added to \nsubprogram 2. The first policy trigger shifted to the P3F required the government to approve the \nports utilization plan designed to decongest container traffic at the Port of Manila and enhance \nport sales in the Subic Bay Freeport and the Port of Batangas. While the Philippines Port \nAuthority (PPA) had drafted a plan and submitted it to the National Economic Development \nAuthority  (NEDA)  board  for  approval,  the  NEDA  board  referred  the  plan  back  for  further \nrevisions, especially in light of the 2014 truck ban that exacerbated congestion at the Port of \nManila. The revised draft plan is expected to be resubmitted to NEDA in early 2015. This policy \ntrigger is shifted to the P3F and is replaced in subprogram 2 with the government\u2019s interim \nmeasure to decongest the Manila container port (para. 19). The second policy trigger shifted to \nthe  P3F  required  the  government  to  provide  budgetary  financing  for  the  tourism  skills \ndevelopment program upon completion of the tourism skills pilot funded under ADB\u2019s TA. This \npolicy trigger has been shifted to the P3F because the pilot will be completed at the end of \n2015. The government is committed to rolling out the skills development program financed \nthrough the national government budget for the fiscal year 2016 (para. 28). \n                                                \n5  Joint Foreign Chambers. 2010.

The impact of the program is an improved investment climate. The benchmark will be  ix\n 4\nprogress made in key global competitiveness indicators. The growth inclusiveness element of a   \nbetter  investment  climate  is  measured  by  the  expansion  in  the  number  of  young  people \nemployed in full-time wage jobs. The outcome of the program will be improved competitiveness  4\n \nof selected sectors such as tourism and infrastructure. An update of the performance indicators \nshows substantial progress in key global competitiveness indicators (para. 7) and a moderate \npickup in young people employed in full-time wage jobs (para. 4). \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  Subprogram  2  supports  the  government\u2019s  efforts  in  improving  competitiveness  and \ninclusiveness with three outputs: (i) implementing structural policy reforms to the economy, (ii) \nstrengthening  the  market  for  infrastructure  projects  through  PPPs,  and  (iii)  promoting \ncompetitive labor markets. All 22 policy measures (14 policy triggers and 8 milestones) required \nfor subprogram 2 have been accomplished. \n \n1.  Output 1: Implementing Structural Policy Reforms to the Economy \n \n15.  Subprogram  2  supports  the  government  in  advancing  its  competition  policy  and \nmeasures to promote competitive trade. These measures build on reforms completed under \nsubprogram 1, which included the start of regulatory impact assessment (RIA) pilot projects at \nDOT and the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), an \u201copen skies\u201d policy, and initial \nreforms to value-added tax (VAT) refunds. \n \n16.  Enhancing  competition  policy  and  regulatory  efficiency.  The  government  has \nimplemented reforms to develop a robust competition policy framework over the longer term. Its \napproach has three pillars: (i) develop a competition policy law, (ii) institutionalize RIAs in \ngovernment, and (iii) undertake sector-by-sector competition and regulatory reforms. Under \nsubprogram 2, the following measures were accomplished to advance this agenda. First, the \ngovernment, through the Department of Justice (DOJ), established the Office for Competition at \nDOJ with 17 staff and a 2014 budget of P10 million. It continued capacity development with \nassistance  from  the  Government  of  Japan  (through  the  Japan  International  Cooperation \nAgency). The Office of Competition has also carried out substantial interagency coordination by \nestablishing five sector working groups and the Sector Regulators Council. Up to mid-2014, the \noffice has received 21 complaints of anticompetitive practices, of which 7 have been resolved \nand the other 14 are ongoing. A main function of the office is to issue advisory opinions, and it \nhas issued two: on airline tickets sales promotions and on supermarkets. \n \n17.  Second, NEDA has established a new division called Governance Staff. Governance \nStaff will be responsible for championing the practice of RIA in government and providing \ncapacity development to line ministries. NEDA is preparing the legal basis for implementing the \npractice of RIA in the executive government during the P3F period. Third, DOLE and DOT are \npiloting  RIAs  in  their  departments  with  ADB  assistance  to  demonstrate  the  benefits  of  a \nsystematic approach to reviewing regulations. Both departments endorsed RIA work plans for \n2013 and 2014. Substantial capacity development of staff in both departments has been carried \nout since 2012. Consequently, DOT has accomplished reviews of three regulations in the sector \nand DOLE has accomplished reviews of eight regulations and programs, such as security of \ntenure  regulations,  foreign  worker  permits,  and  apprenticeship  law.  The  RIAs  provide \nrecommendations and some are being used as inputs for preparing longer-term reforms in both \n ", "5 \nsectors.  DOT  has  also  begun  to  implement  RIA  in  two  attached  agencies  with  important \nregulatory powers in the sector: the Philippine  Retirement Authority and the Scuba Diving \nCommission. Both departments will continue implementing RIA during the P3F period in support \nof the national rollout of RIA in government. DOLE has also established an e-regulation portal \nfor public consultation on regulations, which is expected to be launched at the end of 2014. \n \n18.  Promoting competitive trade logistics. A major reform to the logistics market is the \ngovernment\u2019s  \u201copen  skies\u201d  policy.  In  June  2013,  Congress  enacted  Republic  Act  10378 \nabolishing the common carrier tax (CCT) of 3.0% on foreign airlines\u2019 passenger revenues. The \nCCT was considered a major tax distortion on foreign airlines and prevented equal treatment of \ndomestic and foreign carriers in the domestic aviation market. The new law also exempts \nforeign airlines from the Gross Philippine Billings Tax (GPBT) of 2.5% on gross passenger \nrevenues on the basis of reciprocity with other countries. This reform has now aligned the \nPhilippines\u2019 aviation sector with neighboring economies and will boost the competitiveness of \nthe logistics market and benefit a wide range of industries. \n \n19.  Congestion at the Port of Manila and the underutilization of the Subic Bay Freeport and \nthe Port of Batangas have resulted in lengthy delays in port clearance at the Port of Manila. A \ntruck  ban  in  Manila  from  February  to  September  2014  exacerbated  the  problem.  The \ngovernment has responded in two ways. First, as an interim measure, it issued Presidential \nExecutive Order 172 (dated 13 September 2014) to give the PPA the authority to redirect \ncontainer traffic from the Port of Manila to the Subic Bay Freeport and the Port of Batangas. The \nsecond measure is for the PPA to draft a port utilization plan with measures to make better use \nof the Subic and Batangas ports and thereby decongest the Manila port. The plan will be \nsubmitted to NEDA for approval in early 2015 and implemented during the P3F period. \n \n20.  Another major reform benefiting exporters of goods and services is the reform to VAT \nrefunds for enterprises. Until 2011, enterprises received tax credit certificates (TCCs) for VAT \nrefunds,  instead  of  cash  refunds  commonly  used  elsewhere  in  Southeast  Asia.  The  TCC \napproach tied up the working capital of firms and thereby significantly raised their cost of \nworking capital. Under subprogram 2, the government issued Presidential Executive Order 68-A \nto replace TCCs with cash refunds and direct the encashment of existing TCCs. However, very \nfew cash refunds have been provided to exporters due to a cumbersome refund administration \nprocess at the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR). In response and to support implementation of \nthe executive order, the BIR issued in June 2014 Circular 52-2014, which lays out a more \nconvenient process and administration of claims for VAT refunds consistent with the provisions \nof the National Internal Revenue Code. Finally, to fund the VAT cash refunds and conversion, \nthe 2014 General Appropriations Act (GAA) allocated P8.8 billion to BIR and P6.5 billion to the \nBureau of Customs. \n \n2.  Output  2:  Strengthening  the  Market  for  Infrastructure  Projects  through \nPublic\u2013Private Partnerships \n \n21.  Subprogram 2 supports the government in creating a world-class PPP framework for \ninfrastructure  projects  as  one  financing  modality  to  reverse  the  underinvestment  in \ninfrastructure. The measures build on activities under subprogram 1 that had strengthened the \nfunctions of the Public\u2013Private Partnership Center (PPPC) and the Project Development and \nMonitoring Facility (PDMF). \n \n22.  Strengthening the public\u2013private partnership policy, regulatory, and institutional \nframework. Under subprogram 2, Presidential Executive Order 136 was issued in 2013 to ", "6 \nA\ninstitutionalize the PPP framework by establishing the PPP Governing Board as the overall  p\np\npolicymaking body on PPPs of the PDMF, which is a technical facility providing transaction  en\nd\nadvisory services. The PPPC continues to be the implementing agency for PPP policy and  ix\nactivities.8 Regulations  related  to  PPPs  have  also  been  reviewed  and  improved  under    4\nsubprogram 2. For example, the PPPC completed a review of all PPP-related legislation and \nrecommended amendments to the Build\u2013Operate\u2013Transfer Law to harmonize with the PPP  6\n \nframework. With ADB technical assistance funded by the governments of Australia and Canada, \nsubstantial efforts have been made to boost the government\u2019s capacity for PPPs with 195 \ngovernment staff (56% of them women) received training on the relevant policy and legal \nframework, operating manuals, preparation of feasibility studies, bidding and transactions, and \nother  PPP-related  matters.9 The  government  (through  NEDA  and  the  PPPC)  signed  a \nmemorandum of agreement with the University of New South Wales, Australia, to establish a \ntwinning partnership in PPPs as a vehicle for knowledge sharing and capacity development. \n \n23.  Establishing  long-term  financing  and  risk  guarantee  mechanisms  for  PPPs  in \ninfrastructure.  The  government  (through  the  Department  of  Budget  and  Management) \nallocated in the 2013 GAA P8.1 billion to the Strategic Support Fund for sustainable financing of \nthe government\u2019s share in PPPs. The funds will be used for PPP projects of the Department of \nPublic  Works  and  Highways,  and  the  Department  of  Transportation  and  Communications. \nAnother P20 billion was allocated in the 2014 GAA to cover contingent liabilities that might arise \nfrom PPPs in 2014. \n \n24.  These  reforms  and  capacity  development  activities  have  produced  concrete, \nmeasureable results. Sixteen project feasibility studies have been prepared with the support of \nthe PDMF and with completed gender-responsive checklists. As of 6 November 2014, eight \nPPP projects had awarded contracts with estimated project costs amounting to P127 billion, \namong them the LTR line 1 Cavite Extension (P64.9 billion), the Mactan\u2013Cebu international \nairport passenger terminal (P17.5 billion), the school infrastructure project (P16.3 billion), and \nthe NAIA expressway (P15.5 billion). Another PPP in road construction (P35.5 billion) has \nbidding ongoing, and six more (P172.4 billion) are tendering for bid submission (footnote 8). \nSeveral of these projects are related to tourism infrastructure such as new airports or terminals \nin Bohol, Cebu, and other destinations in line with the DOT\u2019s tourism development plan. \n \n3.  Output 3: Promoting Competitive Labor Markets \n \n25.  Subprogram 2 supports the government in implementing measures and programs to \nimprove youth employment, improve skills development in the workplace, and remove other \nstructural rigidities in the labor market with the aim of stimulating job growth. These reforms \nbuild on subprogram 1, which included the endorsement of the tourism development plan, \nissuance of new hotel and resort standards, and capacity development activities at the public \nemployment service offices (PESOs). \n \n26.  Improving labor market information and employment intermediation systems\u2014\nJobStart Philippines. The government is addressing the problem of the high youth NEET rate \nwith its JobStart Philippines program. JobStart was designed and developed during subprogram \n2 and was made operational as a pilot project in 2014. In 2013, DOLE signed memorandums of \nunderstanding with the mayors of Taguig City, Quezon City, City of San Fernando, and the \nmunicipality of General Trias to pilot JobStart in their PESOs.

Young people \nbetween 18 and 24 years of age with at least high school education and less than 12 months of \nwork experience are eligible to participate. By the end of October 2014, 1,600 eligible persons \nhad been randomly selected into the program and had completed career guidance and life skills \ntraining, and are now being referred to employers for internships. The pilot program is expected \nto end in June 2015, when all beneficiaries have finished their internships. Of those, 56% are \nyoung women, 68% had completed high school education (including some college dropouts), \nand  32%  had  completed  college  or  had  technical  and  vocational  education  and  training \nqualification. Partnering with ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department, a sex-disaggregated \nrandomized impact evaluation has been adopted that will allow a rigorous evaluation of JobStart \nservices\u2019 effect on the employment performance of the young.10 Some 4,300 young people are \nparticipating in the evaluation. The results of the evaluation will guide DOLE on a nationwide \nrollout of JobStart. \n \n27.  In addition to JobStart, the government (through DOLE) continued capacity development \nat selected PESOs for effective service delivery at the LGU level by (i) designing a gender-\nsensitive manual for career guidance and disseminating career guidance modules in the pilot \nPESO, and (ii) developing a labor market information system action plan and beginning to \nimplement it in the four JobStart pilot LGUs. \n \n28.  Promoting  industry-led  skills  and  service  standards  in  tourism.  Employers  in \nseveral sectors complain about the skills mismatch of many high school and college graduates \nand the emerging shortage of skilled workers. The government recognizes these constraints on \ncompetitiveness  and  employment  and  is  trying  to  solve  them  through  both  crosscutting \ninterventions  and  sector-specific  programs.  Under  subprogram  2,  the  government  (through \nDOT) piloted a PPP with employers, known as the tourism skills development program, which is \nan employer-led initiative. Under the program, employers were awarded 25 grants in May 2014 \nto train about 4,300 workers in four locations at an average training cost of P8,000 per worker. \nAbout 46% of the trainees are women, which is below the program\u2019s target of 55%. Incentives \nwill be introduced to increase the share of women in phase 2 of the grant awards (in 2015); for \nexample, additional points will be awarded to applications meeting the gender target. Training \nprograms under phase 1 are currently being implemented. The grantees include high-end hotels \nand resorts partnered with smaller hotels, community-based tourism enterprises, tour guide \nassociations, and tour operators. DOT intends to fund the skills program through the national \ngovernment budget in 2016. The skills grant scheme is being complemented by the new five-\nstar  rating  scheme  designed  to  promote  service  standards  in  hotels  and  resorts.  Under \nsubprogram 2, third-party international and national assessors were engaged to assist with \nquality audits of hotels and resorts under the new rating system. The audits covered 693 hotels \nand resorts nationwide, of which 141 hotels and resorts are in the four pilot areas of Bohol, \nCebu, Davao, and Palawan and were assessed with TA support from ADB and the Government \nof Canada. Ratings should be announced in the fourth quarter of 2014. \n \n29.  Strengthening employment policies and programs. The government initiated actions \nto improve labor and employment policies and programs with the aim of generating employment \nand  improving  access  to  decent  jobs.  This  included  the  following:  (i)  DOLE  completed \npreliminary  impact  assessments  on  selected  employment  programs  such  as  the  Special \nProgram  for  Employment  of  Poor  Students  and  the  apprenticeship  program,  and  made \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2013.

Post-program partnership framework. The program has also defined in detail the P3F \nactivities  that  will  sustain future reforms  beyond  subprogram  2,  especially  regarding  youth \nemployment,  PPPs  for  infrastructure,  and  regulatory  reform  through  RIA.  Thirteen  policy \nmeasures are included in the P3F, covering November 2014\u2013March 2016 and providing the \nbuilding blocks for the next generation of possible policy-based loans and projects, e.g., for \ninfrastructure improvement in 2016, enhancement of rural enterprises and rural employment in \n2016, and improvements to the school\u2013work transition of young people in 2017. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n31.  To support its reform initiatives, the government has requested a single-tranche loan of \n$350,000,000  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  to  help  finance  subprogram  2  of  the \nprogrammatic approach. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, \n(30% annuity amortization method); an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreement. \nBased on this, the average loan maturity is 12.1 years and there is no maturity premium payable \nto ADB. The government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility  based  on  these  terms  and  conditions,  and  (ii)  an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full \nforeign exchange cost (excluding local taxes and duties) of items produced and procured in \nADB member countries, excluding ineligible items and imports listed in the negative list attached \nto  the  loan  agreement.  In  accordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of \nDisbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans,13 the proceeds of the \npolicy-based loan will be disbursed to the Republic of the Philippines as the borrower. \n \n32.  The size of the program loan is based on (i) the importance of the sector to the economy \nand the weight of the benefits of the reform program (para. 35), (ii) the need to conform to the \noverall financing requirement of the country partnership strategy period, and (iii) development \nexpenditure supported by the reform program.14 The government\u2019s net development financing \nneeds are P266 billion for 2014, to which overseas development assistance loans contributes \nP52 billion. Net financing needs for 2015 are P184 billion. The subprogram 2 loan proceeds \nsupport  key  development  spending  in  the  2013  and  2014  GAA  that  arose  from  the \naccomplishment of subprogram 2 policy triggers, such as (i) 2014 GAA allocation of P15.3 \nbillion to fund the VAT cash refund policy trigger under subprogram 2, (ii) 2013 GAA allocation \nof P8.1 billion to fund the Strategic Support Fund and the 2014 GAA allocation of P20 billion to \ncover contingent liabilities arising from PPPs in 2014, and (iii) other spending items in 2014 \nGAA allocations, such as for the budget for the Office of Competition at the DOJ.

The single-tranche loan will be disbursed in two installments by 31 December 2015. The \ngovernment  requested  multiple  installments  to  ensure  efficient  cash-flow  management  by \nminimizing (i) the incidence of negative carry that may occur due to a potential mismatch in \ntiming between disbursement of the full loan amount and its full utilization; and (ii) the burden of \nfull financing charges that would arise due to higher interest payments payable on a fully \ndisbursed loan, as compared with lower commitment charges payable on a loan disbursed in \ntwo installments. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n34.  Subprogram 2 covers October 2012\u2013October 2014. The P3F covers November 2014\u2013\nMarch 2016. DOF is the executing agency for the program and is responsible for the overall \nimplementation of subprogram 2, P3F and the medium-term results framework and coordination \namong the implementing agencies. The program implementing agencies\u2014DOJ, DOLE, DOT, \nNEDA,  DOTC,  DTI,  the  Bureau  of  Customs,  and  BIR\u2014are  responsible  for  day-to-day \nimplementation of subprogram 2.  \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n35.  ADB  staff  simulations  indicate  that  the  potential  benefits  of  the  reforms  over  the \nprogram\u2019s medium-term period\u2014from 2011 to 2016\u2014could be about $2.65 billion (in 2010 \nprices).  These  economic  benefits  arise  from  lower  costs  of  trade  logistics,  an  improved \ncompetition  policy,  and  increased  investment  in  infrastructure.  The  reform  costs  to  the \ngovernment and the private sector are conservatively estimated at $838.2 million discounted \nover the program\u2019s medium-term period. These costs include the administrative and fiscal costs \nto the government in implementing the reforms and direct budgetary funding of the Strategic \nSupport Fund and the PDMF (footnote 14). \n \nB.  Governance \n \n36.  Improved governance and anticorruption efforts are core priorities of the government. \nThe  government\u2019s  public  financial  management  (PFM)  reform  roadmap  was  announced  in \nFebruary 2011, and it includes a series of short- to medium-term reforms building on previous \naccomplishments  made  since  2006.  The  reforms  address  PFM  risks  related  to  budget \ncredibility, weak government internal audit, and inefficient procurement system, among other \nrisks.15 The plan is supported by development partners. ADB has supported public financial \nmanagement reforms since 2006, starting with its Development Policy Support Program loan \ncompleted in 2009.16 ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n37.  Subprogram 2 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. The NEET rates are \nhigher among young women than young men. The program aims to narrow this gender gap by \n                                                \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n16 ADB 2009.

Safeguards   \n \n38.  The  program  does  not  trigger  the  safeguard  policies  and  is  categorized  C  for  1\n0\nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. The following arrangements are   \nagreed on and will be incorporated into the legal agreement. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating to the program. The government agreed to cooperate, and shall cause any and all \ngovernment  offices,  organizations,  and  entities  involved  in  implementing  the  program  to \ncooperate fully with any such investigation and to extend all necessary assistance, including \nproviding access to all relevant books and records, as may be necessary, for the satisfactory \ncompletion of any such investigation. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n39.  Overall the risks to the program are rated from low to medium and are expected to be \noutweighed by the program impact and benefits (footnote 15). The two main political economy \nrisks to the program are weak interagency coordination and the reform agenda remaining \nsensitive to political interests. The program includes mitigating measures. TA is provided to \nsupport capacity development and interagency coordination on key reforms, including signing of \nmemorandums  of  understanding  between  DOLE  and  the  mayors  of  four  LGUs.  The  P3F \nembeds  measures  to  support  the  rollout  of  JobStart  Philippines  and  the  tourism  skills \ndevelopment program. DOLE is also looking at possible legislative initiatives to sustain relevant \nreforms under the P3F.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n \n40.  The government and the Department of Finance have assured ADB that implementation \nof  subprogram  2  shall  conform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies,  including  those  concerning \nanticorruption measures, safeguards, gender, procurement, and disbursement as described in \ndetail in the loan agreement.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $350,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 2 of the Increasing \nCompetitiveness for Inclusive Growth Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB's London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan \nagreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n24 November 2014\n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact  By December 2018:  World Economic Forum  Assumption \nImproved investment    Global Competitiveness  Economic stability \nclimate  (i) Philippines\u2019 ranking in  Report  is maintained. \nglobal surveys of     \ncompetitiveness improved by  Heritage Foundation Index  Risk \nat least 15 places (2010  of Economic Freedom  Lack of effective \nbaseline); and    coordination \n(ii) youth full-time wage  World Bank Group Doing  between national \nemployment increased by an  Business reports  government \naverage of 5.0% per annum    departments \n(2010 baseline: average 3.4%  National Statistics Office \ngrowth in 1991\u20132010).  household labor force \nsurvey \nOutcome  By December 2015:    Assumption \nImproved      Government stays \ncompetitiveness of  (i) number of people who  DOLE annual PESO data  on course with key \nselected sectors  found jobs through    business \ninstitutionalized PESOs    regulation reform. \nincreased by 10% per annum     \n(2010 baseline: average    Risk \n1,000 people per PESO);    Lack of \n(ii) cost of rules and  ADB business licensing  commitment and \nregulations for key licenses  survey 2015   willingness of \nreduced by 15%    government \n(2014 baseline);a/    agencies and \n(iii) Philippines ranking in    stakeholders to \nglobal logistics performance  World Bank Logistics  participate in \nindex improved by at least 10  Performance Index  implementing \nplaces (2010 baseline: rank    reforms \n44 out of 155 countries); and   \n(iv) Philippines ranking in   \nglobal travel and tourism  World Economic Forum \ncompetitiveness index  Travel and Tourism \nimproved by at least  Competitiveness Report \n15 places (2011 baseline: \nrank 94 out of 139 countries). \nOutputs  By December 2014:    Risks \n1.
