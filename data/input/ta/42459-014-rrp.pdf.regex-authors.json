THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the additional financing of the Local \nGovernment Enhancement Sector Project.1 \n \n2.  The project supports the improvement of local infrastructure and services delivered by \nlocal authorities in less-developed areas of Sri Lanka. The additional financing will expand the \ncurrent project,2 which is performing well. It includes (i) improving water supply systems to \nmitigate the risks of chronic kidney disease (CKD), (ii) improving local infrastructure and basic \nservices delivery, and (iii) advancing policy reform and strengthening  the capacity of local \ngovernments.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  ADB support to local governments. Sri Lanka has three types of local authorities \nunder nine provincial councils: (i) municipal councils constituted in cities and large towns, (ii) \nurban councils for less urbanized areas, and (iii) Pradeshiya Sabhas (local authorities) in peri-\nurban and rural areas.4 To respond to the need to improve basic infrastructure and services \nprovided  by  local  authorities,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Local \nGovernment  Infrastructure  Improvement  Project  in  2005.5 The  infrastructure  improvement \nproject  supported  subprojects  for  water  supply;  roads;  drainage  and  sewerage;  and  other \nmunicipal facilities such as public libraries, health care centers, and office buildings, under a \nbottom-up, demand-driven approach that follows the priorities set out by local authorities, and \nimproves  the  financial  management  capacity  of  these  authorities.  One  limitation  of  the \ninfrastructure improvement project was that financial constraints prevented participation by poor \nand financially  weak  Pradeshiya  Sabhas,  which  thus  were  unable  to  benefit.6 The  current \nproject, which was approved in 2011 (footnote 2), expanded the infrastructure improvement \nproject\u2019s interventions by targeting poorer Pradeshiya Sabhas to improve basic service delivery \nin less-developed areas in seven of the nine provinces (excluding the Northern and Eastern \nprovinces). The subprojects selected under the current project reflect the needs of the local \npeople and are implemented by local authorities, who will remain responsible for operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of the assets that are being built. \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework of the project has been revised as Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Local Government Enhancement Sector Project. Manila (Loan \n2790-SRI). \n3  Subproject design, preparation of bidding documents, costs in meeting safeguards requirements, and other due \ndiligence for the additional financing were partially financed under the current loan. \n4  There are 22 municipal councils, 42 urban councils, and 271 Pradeshiya Sabhas in Sri Lanka as of 2016. Local \nauthorities are established under the Pradeshiya Sabhas Act Number 15 of 1987, and are the smallest political unit \nin peri-urban and rural areas. \n5  ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Local Government Infrastructure Improvement Project. Manila \n(Loan 2201-SRI). All local authorities (including Pradeshiya Sabhas) of the Northern and Eastern provinces are \ncovered under the World Bank\u2019s North East Local Services Improvement Project. The infrastructure improvement \nproject also supported 19 Pradeshiya Sabhas in these two provinces. \n6  Under the infrastructure improvement project, Pradeshiya Sabhas had to borrow as well as contribute a part of the \nsubproject cost, which prevented financially weaker Pradeshiya Sabhas from fully benefiting. \n ", "2 \n4.  Project support for local infrastructure development. The local authorities under the \ncurrent project are implementing one to three subprojects each; these are chosen based on \nlocal priorities, with a ceiling of SLRs50 million (about $0.4 million).7 The focus of subprojects \ncompleted  or  under  implementation  includes  (i)  environmental  infrastructure,  (ii)  economic \ninfrastructure, (iii) public health infrastructure, and (iv) other local authority facilities. Although \nthe scale of the investments is small, the interventions are having a tangible development \nimpact  in  local  communities  because  they  address  critical  local  needs.  For  example,  the \nHuluganga bridge constructed in Panwila Pradeshiya Sabha in the Central Province enabled its \ninhabitants to commute to the adjacent town for basic services (e.g., health care, education, and \nmarkets); prior to construction of the bridge they had to take a circuitous road, which was 10 \nkilometers longer. Public health and other facilities built by the current project have enabled \nlocal authorities to provide better public services to their citizens. \n \n5.  Local government reforms. To receive support from the project, a Pradeshiya Sabha \nhad to agree to undertake a set of reforms. This has proven effective in advancing reform in \nlocal  authorities.  All  108  Pradeshiya  Sabhas  supported  under  the  current  project  have \ndeveloped and implemented a reform plan addressing (i) improving service delivery, with a \nfocus on local environmental improvement (including solid waste management); (ii) streamlining \ntaxation,  licensing,  and  approval  systems  and  processes;  (iii)  ensuring  the  effective \nmanagement of the government\u2019s assets; and (iv) improving the administration systems and \nmanagement. Administration of Pradeshiya Sabhas has improved as a result of the reforms, \nfacilitated by the use of information technology to unify and improve forms; produce computer-\ngenerated receipts and approvals; track applications; and manage grievances, property taxes, \nand libraries. These measures are increasing own-source revenues, speeding processing of \ncitizen applications, reducing workloads for citizens and local officials in Pradeshiya Sabhas, \nand resulting in provision of additional, more efficient services to citizens.8 Front office functions \nhave been established in more than 90 Pradeshiya Sabhas to provide more efficient, citizen-\nfriendly one-stop services. \n \n6.  Safe  drinking  water  supply  in  areas  affected  by  the  chronic  kidney  disease. \nSufficient supply of safe drinking water has become an urgent priority in the dry zones of the \ncountry, particularly in the North Central Province and in some areas in the Central, Eastern, \nNorthern, North Western, and Uva provinces, where CKD of unknown etiology is becoming a \nmajor public health threat.9 Scarcity of safe drinking water is considered as one of the most \nimportant risk factors leading to CKD. The government has accorded top priority to mitigate \nCKD, and established the Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease in \n2015. The National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) has been tasked to prepare \nand  implement  projects  for  safe  drinking  water  supply  in  the  affected  areas  through  the \ninstallation of reverse osmosis plants, the procurement of water tankers to carry safe drinking \nwater  to  remote  areas,  the  extension  of  the existing  water  supply  network,  and rainwater \nharvesting.10 The  government  requested  ADB  support  for  sustainable  safe  drinking  water \nservices in CKD-affected areas. Seven schemes with a total of $3.9 million in funding are being \n                                                \n7  For Pradeshiya Sabhas implementing water supply subprojects, this ceiling did not apply. \n8  For example, Bingiriya Pradeshiya Sabha in the North Western Province was able to (i) increase tax collection \nefficiency from 44% in 2013 to 81% in 2015, (ii) increase the amount of tax collection by 93% during 2013\u20132015, \nand (iii) reduce arrears by 60% during 2013\u20132016.  \n9  There are an estimated 70,000 CKD patients in known high-risk areas, with a majority from the North Central \nProvince. The annual death toll is about 2,000. The World Health Organization has recommended the provision of \nclean drinking water in CKD endemic areas, which can be done through central treatment facilities and a piped \nnetwork. \n10 By December 2015, excluding ADB\u2019s financing, NWSDB implemented water supply systems improvement worth \nabout SLRs1,000 million ($7 million) in CKD-affected areas in the six provinces. \n ", "3 \nsupported by the current project, but the need is much greater, for which additional financing is \nrequired.  \n \n7.  Demand for expanding the current project\u2019s successful model. The current project \nis rated on track. It has managed the risks identified during processing and implementation, and \nsuccessful implementation of the project is not threatened by major risks. Hence, expanding the \ncurrent project\u2019s model for the additional financing modality is suitable because of (i) strong links \nof  additional  financing  with  the  current  project  in  terms  of  design  and  implementation \narrangements, (ii) the urgency to support water supply improvement in areas affected by CKD, \n(iii) the opportunity to expand the benefits of the current project in terms of reforms and local \ninfrastructure improvement, and (iv) the high degree of project readiness. Through provision of \nadditional financing, the government is seeking to expand the successful investment and reform \nsupport provided under the current project and the preceding infrastructure improvement project \nto Pradeshiya Sabhas that did not receive prior support. As the capacity of Pradeshiya Sabhas \nin  less-developed  areas  is  generally  very  limited,  the  additional  financing  will  continue \nsupporting  reforms,  enabling  the  provision  of  citizen-centric  basic  services  by  Pradeshiya \nSabhas, and strengthening their financial and administrative capacity. The additional financing \nwill also expand support for improvement of water supply systems in CKD-affected areas, which \nwill be the first large-scale intervention to reduce the risk of CKD. The additional financing is \nconsistent with the ADB (i) Water Operational Plan, by addressing efficiencies in water use \nwhile improving access to safe drinking water supply; and (ii) Operational Plan for Health, by \naiming to enhance health outcomes from water supply improvement.11 \n \n8.  Additional financing eligibility criteria. ADB eligibility criteria for additional financing \nhave  been  met.12 The  project  (i)  remains  technically  feasible,  economically  viable,  and \nfinancially sound; (ii) is accorded high priority by the government; (iii) is consistent with the \ncurrent  project\u2019s  development  objectives;  and  (iv)  is  consistent  with  the  current  country \npartnership strategy, which prioritizes inclusive and sustainable economic growth, including \nimproving access to drinking water in lagging regions.13 The current project is performing well in \naccordance with ADB's additional financing policy, and is on track to deliver the expected \noutputs. 14 As of 11 July 2016, cumulative current project contract awards total $48.5 million \n(92.8% of the ADB net loan amount), and disbursements, $34.2 million (65.1%). Subprojects \nare relatively small in scale, and safeguards compliance has been met.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be local authorities\u2019 capacity financially and technically strengthened in \nless-developed areas of seven provinces in Sri Lanka. The outcome will be improved local \ninfrastructure  and  services  delivered  effectively  by  local  authorities  or  NWSDB  in  less-\ndeveloped areas of seven provinces in Sri Lanka. The impact statement is unchanged. The \noutcome statement was changed because most of the water supply schemes in areas affected \nby CKD will be operated by NWSDB. The original and aggregate targets are in the revised \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2011.

The overall project with additional financing has three outputs. Output 1 has been added \nfor the additional financing. The additions and modifications are in the revised design and \nmonitoring framework. \n \n11.  Output  1:  Water  supply  systems  in  chronic  kidney  disease-affected  areas \nimproved. The additional financing will support development and expansion of water supply \nsystems in CKD-affected areas in the four provinces (Central, North Central, North Western, \nand Uva) to provide a continuous supply of safe drinking water. The schemes include the \ndevelopment of new water supply systems and the expansion of existing systems, mostly run by \nNWSDB. Facilities such as raw water intakes, water treatment plants, overhead tanks, and \ntransmission  and  distribution  networks  leading  to  household  connections  are  eligible  for \nfinancing.15 About 30 schemes will be developed or expanded, and will be implemented by the \nrespective  provincial  councils  with  technical  inputs  and  supervision  support  from  NWSDB. \nConsidering the nature and complexity of the schemes, the piped network will be operated by \nNWSDB, except for a few local authorities that have adequate operational capacity. If local \nauthorities are identified to be the appropriate entity to implement the subprojects, such local \nauthorities will first have to submit a reform plan, as practiced in the current project, prior to \nimplementation of the subproject. The additional financing will also ensure efficient use of water \nthrough nonrevenue water reduction programs. \n \n12.  Output 2: Local infrastructure and basic services delivery improved. The additional \nfinancing will support  improvement of social and economic infrastructure  in 29 Pradeshiya \nSabhas from five provinces (Central, North Western, Southern, Uva, and Western) that have not \nreceived support under either the infrastructure improvement project or the current project. The \napproach will remain the same; these Pradeshiya Sabhas will have to submit a reform plan \napproved through a council resolution, which will be reviewed and confirmed by the Ministerial \nCommittee of the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government (MPCLG) to ensure that \nthe minimum reform requirements are met. They will then be eligible for provision of a capital \ngrant for infrastructure improvement. Eligible subprojects include (i) environmental infrastructure \nsuch  as  water  supply  and  sanitation  (including  sewerage),  drainage,  and  solid  waste \nmanagement; (ii) economic infrastructure such as roads and bridges (including suspension \nbridges); (iii) public health infrastructure such as maternity and health care centers; and (iv) \nother local authority facilities such as public markets. \n \n13.  Output 3: Local government policy reform advanced and capacity strengthened. \nThe additional financing will support advancing business process reengineering and additional \ncapacity-building measures in the original and additional Pradeshiya Sabhas.16 The activities \nwill  include  (i)  support  for  implementing  the  guidelines  developed  under  the  capacity \ndevelopment  technical  assistance;17 (ii)  establishment  and  implementation  of  information \n                                                \n15 When providing drinking water through a piped network proves too costly, installation of reverse osmosis plants to \npurify groundwater and procurement of water tankers to supply the treated water may be necessary. These \nschemes will be fully financed by the government and are not included in the scope of the additional financing. \n16 The additional Pradeshiya Sabhas include the 29 under output 2, and those that will implement and operate water \nsupply system improvements under output 1. \n17 Thirteen guidelines have been developed by  ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist \nRepublic  of  Sri  Lanka  for  the  Local  Government  Enhancement  Sector  Project.  Manila,  as  follows:  (i)  tax \nenforcement and arrears recovery manual, (ii) information sources available for local authorities to increase \ncoverage, (iii) standard agreement template for lease, (iv) service charge rationalization model, (v) extension of \nbuilt-up locality in Pradeshiya Sabhas, (vi) incentive scheme for revenue collectors, (vii) standard request for \nproposal  for  selection  of  survey  agency  for  conducting  third-party  surveys,  (viii)  process  awareness,  (ix) \n ", "5 \ntechnology  solutions  in  the  additional  Pradeshiya  Sabhas; (iii)  continuation  of support  and \nimprovement  of  information  technology  solutions  in  the  original  108  Pradeshiya  Sabhas, \nincluding the development and installation of additional software to simplify and increase the \nefficiency of local administration; (iv) support for implementing reform plans in the original and \nadditional  Pradeshiya  Sabhas;  and  (v)  capacity-building  programs  to  strengthen  technical, \nfinancial,  and  administrative  capacity  of  the  original  and  additional  Pradeshiya  Sabhas, \nprovincial councils, and MPCLG. \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MPCLG  will  continue  to  be  the  executing  agency,  through  its  existing  project \nmanagement unit (PMU), supported by the project management consultant and the design and \nsupervision consultants. Subproject coordination units (SPCUs) under the provincial councils of \nseven provinces will also continue to function as the implementation units at the provincial \nlevel.20 Provincial councils will implement all subprojects under outputs 1 and 2 under the \nadditional financing. NWSDB will prepare detailed designs, and provide technical assistance \nand supervision to the subprojects under output 1, for which it will assume O&M responsibility. It \nwill also be represented in the procurement committee and technical bid evaluation committee \nof these subprojects. The close involvement of NWSDB will ensure technically sound design, \nimplementation, and operation. For output 2, the PMU, through the design and supervision \nconsultants,  will  support  detailed  design  preparation  and  ensure  work  quality.  Pradeshiya \nSabhas will manage the assets built under output 2, as is the case for the current project.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n18.  NWSDB will be responsible for design and supervision of most water supply schemes in \nCKD-affected  areas,  as  well  as  O&M  of  the  schemes.  These  subprojects  are  technically \nstraightforward  and  within  the  existing  capacity  of  NWSDB.  Technical  viability  has  been \nconfirmed for four water supply schemes in the North Central and North Western provinces, and \nwill be confirmed for the remaining schemes during subproject preparation. As in the current \nproject, the technical viability of subprojects under output 2 will be confirmed during feasibility \nstudies, with due consideration of local capacity to undertake O&M. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n19.  Economic analysis. The government identified water supply subprojects under output \n1. Subprojects under output 2 will be selected through a participatory consultation process. The \neconomic analysis  was carried out for two sample water supply subprojects, chosen from \namong the identified subprojects in the North Central Province, and for which detailed designs \nhave already been completed: an extension of the distribution network  in Bendiwewa and \ncapacity enhancement of the Minneriya water treatment plant. The estimated economic internal \nrates of return of the two sample subprojects range from 16.4% to 23.0%, higher than the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital (estimated at 12.0%), indicating sufficient economic return. \nThe results of the sensitivity analysis are also satisfactory (except when all downside risks are \ncombined), against (i) capital costs overrun of 20%, (ii) O&M costs overrun of 20%, (iii) benefit \ndecrease of 20%, and (iv) 1-year implementation delay. \n ", "8 \n20.  Financial  analysis.  Some  subprojects  expected  under  output  2\u2014such  as  roads, \nbridges,  and  drainage  improvements\u2014do  not  generate  cash  revenues,  while  water  supply \nsubprojects under output 1 do generate cash revenues. Therefore, a financial analysis was \nconducted for two sample representative water supply subprojects under output 1. The financial \ninternal rates of return were estimated at 4.4% for the network extension in Bendiwewa and \n7.8% for the capacity enhancement of the Minneriya water treatment plant, higher than the \nweighted average cost of capital of 2.8%, indicating sufficient financial return. The results for \nboth subprojects are also satisfactory against downside risks, including (i) 10% increase in \ncapital expenditure, (ii) 10% increase in O&M costs, (iii) 10% decrease in revenues, and (iv) a 1-\nyear implementation delay. All water supply subprojects under output 1 are expected to be \nfinancially viable as a result of a 25% water tariff increase every 3 years, and 100% grant \nfunding for the capital cost. Moreover, confirming the financial viability of revenue-generating \nsubprojects under outputs 1 and 2 is one of the subproject selection criteria. For nonrevenue-\ngenerating subprojects under output 2, the PMU will assess the capacity and commitment of \nlocal authorities to allocate adequate O&M funding to sustain service delivery when it reviews \nthe subproject request from local authorities. \n \nC.  Governance \n21.  Project-specific  governance  risks  were  identified  through  the  financial  management \nassessment of MPCLG, provincial councils, Pradeshiya Sabhas, and NWSDB.21 All entities are \nestablished  organizations  with  appropriate  accounting, reporting,  internal  control,  and  audit \nmechanisms. Based on the assessment, the overall fiduciary risk is considered moderate, and \nthe proposed risk-mitigating actions include (i) strengthening the internal audit divisions by \nrecruiting new staff in provincial councils and providing adequate training with the support of \nMPCLG;  and  (ii)  procurement  of  an  appropriate  accounting  package,  and  training  staff  in \nprovincial councils on use of the package. The current project has implemented  capacity-\nbuilding programs, including the development of financial accounting and asset-management \nsystems  of  Pradeshiya  Sabhas.  The  additional  financing  will  provide  further  support  for \nimproving the financial management capacity of entities concerned. \n \n22.  An  updated  procurement  assessment  confirmed  that  the  MPCLG  has  a  sound \nprocurement system in line with ADB guidelines. The procurement system is accountable and \ntransparent, and the overall procurement risk is low. The PMU and the SPCUs have experience \nin procurement in accordance with ADB requirements and have a satisfactory track record. \nProcurement for civil  works and equipment will be handled  either at the central or at the \nprovincial level to reduce procurement risks, as the PMU and SPCUs have higher capacity and \nmore experience than do local authorities. Transparency in procurement, financing, and other \nmatters will be maximized under the project through such measures as development by the \nPMU  of  a  website  to  disclose  project  information  and  thereby  reduce  corruption  risk  and \nimprove  governance.  Implementation  of  reform  plans  by  local  authorities  will  improve \ngovernance, through measures such as enhancing citizens\u2019 participation, improving financial \nmanagement, and establishing a grievance redress mechanism (GRM), as proven in the current \nproject. \n \n23.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \n                                                \n21 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nD.  Poverty and Social \n24.  The project is classified as effective gender mainstreaming. While Sri Lanka has a good \ntrack record in gender equality, and in particular in education and health, many women are \ndisadvantaged  owing  to  poor  roads,  water  supply,  sanitation,  and  other  public  services, \nparticularly  in  less-developed  areas  of  the  country.  Limited  access  to  safe  drinking  water \nrequires household members, primarily women and children, to spend considerable time and \neffort on fetching water. Inadequate and poor-quality roads limit access by poor communities to \nmarkets, health care centers, and schools, and create safety and security issues for women and \ngirls. Subprojects implemented under the current project addressed the immediate needs of \nthese communities, including women. Construction of maternity centers and day care centers \ndirectly benefited women, and improvement of water supply systems eased the workload of \nwomen in fetching water. Under the additional financing, all local authority facilities, including \nlibraries, public markets, and health care centers, will have a separate toilet for women and for \nthe disabled, as in the current project. More than 100,000 women will receive treated water that \nmeets drinking water quality standards. An updated gender action plan will ensure that the \ninclusive and participatory approach will be followed  to address the needs of women and \nsocially marginalized groups. Resources are allocated for the implementation and monitoring of \nthe gender action plan. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n25.  The safeguard categories are the same as for the current project: category B for the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and  indigenous peoples. Compliance with safeguard \nrequirements in the current project has been satisfactory and risks well-managed. The project-\nspecific GRM has been established and functional, with no pending grievance cases reported.22 \nThe  additional  financing  will  have  no  significant  impacts  on  the  environment,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples, as subprojects with significant impacts will be excluded in \naccordance with the subproject selection criteria. The environmental assessment and review \nframework, resettlement framework, and indigenous peoples planning framework prepared for \nthe current project were updated to provide guidance in screening, categorizing, and preparing \nsubprojects,  and  for  impact  mitigation  planning  in  the  event  unanticipated  environmental, \nresettlement,  and/or  indigenous  peoples  impacts  arise  during  implementation.  Three  initial \nenvironmental examinations (IEEs) with environmental management plans prepared for sample \nsubprojects  confirmed  there  were  no  significant  environmental  impacts,  because  the \nsubprojects are small in scale, with very limited impacts. Subproject sites are located outside \nsensitive areas, and any impacts during construction and operation can be avoided and/or \nmitigated through proper design and high-quality construction and O&M practices. IEEs will form \npart  of  the  bidding  and  contract  documents  and  will  be  submitted  to  ADB  for  review,  no \nobjection, and disclosure prior to contract awards. Due diligence reports on land acquisition and \nresettlement were prepared for the same three sample subprojects to confirm there are no \nimpacts  on  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  Consultation  and  public \nparticipation  will  continue  throughout  project  implementation,  and  any  safeguard-related \ngrievances  will  be  handled  in  accordance  with  the  existing  GRM.  The  three  framework \ndocuments, IEEs, and due diligence reports were disclosed on ADB and MPCLG websites. The \nproject has developed institutional capacity on safeguards, with safeguard managers in place in \nPMU and SPCUs, supported by specialists in project management and design, and supervision. \nThe semiannual safeguard monitoring reports will be submitted and disclosed on ADB website. \n                                                \n22 A total of nine grievance cases were recorded, and all cases have been satisfactorily resolved. \n ", "10 \nF.
