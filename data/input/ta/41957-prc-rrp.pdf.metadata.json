I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to CNY2.8 billion without government guarantee, of which up to CNY1.4 billion (A loan) will be \nfunded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and up to CNY1.4 billion (B loan) will be funded \nby international or local banks under participation agreements between ADB and such banks, to \nthe joint ventures established by Dalkia Asia and local partners for the Municipal District Energy \nInfrastructure Development Project (the Project). If approved, the Project will be ADB\u2019s first \nprivate sector project to provide assistance to municipal district energy systems (DES). It will \nconstitute ADB\u2019s 21st nonsovereign assistance in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  District Energy System \n1.  Energy Efficiency in Heating and Cooling  \n2.  Urban areas are responsible for about 75% of all energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) \nemissions in the world. Buildings account for nearly 40% of GHG emissions worldwide, and close \nto  70%  in cities  like New  York  and  London.  Improving  energy  efficiency  in  buildings  with \nappropriate technologies determines the pattern of energy use for many years. Substantial \nprogress is being made in increasing the energy efficiency of individual buildings. Beyond these \nimprovements, major opportunities are available through the broader rebuilding of an integrated \napproach of DES to the planning, construction and operation of these systems. The integration of \nenergy generation and use occurs not only within energy end users (such as buildings or \nindustrial installations) but also between (a variety of) energy end users. Linking buildings \ntogether using pipelines enables installation of a central plant that is more economically viable \nand environment friendly. Heated or chilled water is piped underground from the central plant to \nindividual buildings within a designated area for heating, cooling, or industrial use.  \n \n3.  Use  of  DES,  including  integrated  centralized  combined  heat  and  power  (CHP),  is \nrecognized as one of the most significant ways to maximize the efficiency of heating and cooling \nand the electricity generation process. It provides the means to (i) use the waste heat and save \nenergy while displacing the need for additional heat generating plants; and (ii) share heat loads, \nthereby  using  the  plant  more  effectively  and  efficiently.  Typically  the  pipeline  network  is \ndeveloped over time with heat-only boilers used in the early years. Later when the network \ncoverage reaches a critical mass, the network is to be connected to centralized CHP plant, which \nallows significant reduction of fuel consumption based on recycling of surplus heat from the \npower station. Furthermore, some of the heat from the CHP generator is utilized in an absorption \nchiller to produce cold water. The water is circulated through insulated mains to provide cooling \nto the various end users. An ice storage system can be added to this scheme to meet peak load \ndemands.1 \n \n4.  Since 1983, the International Energy Agency (IEA)2 has promoted DES with CHP to \nreduce GHG emissions, promote sustainable development, and reduce vulnerability to supply \ndisruptions. Some countries, particularly in Scandinavia, have a significant penetration of district \n                                                 \n1  The ice store will be frozen at night using chillers driven by electricity from the CHP generators. The ice will be used \nto provide cooling during the day. \n2  District Heating and Cooling including the Integration of CHP has been one of seven building-related implementing \narrangements operating under the auspices of the IEA. \n ", "2   \nheating\u2014more than 50% of the heat market. Increasingly, in many parts of the world the DES \nconcept is being implemented for cooling. In the United States and other countries where cooling \nis important, use of district cooling has grown significantly. \n \n2.  District Heating in the PRC \n5.  In the PRC, heating needs for households and industries have been met mainly by \ncoal-fired stoves and heat-only boilers. Since household stoves have very low efficiency and are \nnot convenient or safe, the PRC started implementing a unique district heating system in the \n1950s. It involves a large number of smaller plants directly linked to localized heat networks, \nwhich  cover  a  relatively  small  area.  Under  the  centrally  planned  and  controlled  economy, \nproviding heating during the winter was considered a general welfare service, which was priced \nbelow the cost of providing services. \n \n6.  Successful economic reforms and significant growth of the overall PRC economy have \naccelerated urbanization and increased heating demand. The PRC is now the second largest \ndistrict heating market behind the Russian Federation. It is comparable to 27 countries of the \nEuropean Union combined and 5.5 times larger than the United States market. Yet district \nheating represents only about 30% of the floor area even in northern cities, leaving a large \nservice area still served by decentralized systems. Compared to the 55%\u201360% penetration in \nEuropean countries, this presents substantial opportunities for further expansion. Total heated \nfloor area reached 2.5 billion m2 in 2005 and is expected to reach 3.6 billion m2 in 2010 and 7.5 \nbillion m2 in 2020. \n \n7.  Growing  demand  for  district  heating  has  highlighted  the  energy  inefficiency  and \nenvironmental concerns under the current heating system. In most cities, the operation is still run \nby municipally owned utility companies which have neglected minimum level of investment and \nmaintenance for lack of adequate finance. The aging pipeline network caused 233,000 general \nfailures in district heating networks in 140 cities and 1,400 serious breakdowns from 2001\u20132005. \nThe majority of end users receive heat directly from the heat source at low temperature. The \noperations tend to be intermittent which further decreases the temperature of the circulating hot \nwater. To obtain heated water sooner, end users often dispose of the circulating water. This \ntogether with leakage due to the aging pipeline network causes significant water loss\u2014about \n8\u201330 times higher than a modern DES system. Furthermore, the existing heating system has \nrelatively  high  thermal  heat  losses  due  to  oversize  pipe  diameters,  pumps,  valves,  and \nsubstations.  \n \n8.  Household stoves have very low efficiency (less than 30%). Under the current district \nheating system, heat (hot water) is typically sourced by many small coal-fired heat-only boilers \n(as opposed to centralized CHP) with boiler house capacity of 2\u201314 megawatts (MW) or 3\u201320 \ntons  of  steam/hour,  which  are  also  inefficient  (40%\u201345%).  Because  stove  and  boiler \nsmokestacks are not tall and not equipped with adequate pollution control devices, they directly \ndisperse smoke into the air near residences, creating health problems. During the winter, black \nsmoke commonly floats in the air, and fly ash covers districts in northern cities. Despite the \nGovernment efforts to replace small boilers with central heating systems, more than 500,000 \nsmall coal-fired heat-only boilers are still in operation in the country. These heating systems, in \naddition to numerous coal-fired boilers and stoves used by individual households and industries, \nconsume almost half of the country's coal and are the largest single-point sources of urban air \npollution. The resulting local, national, and global environmental impact could be substantial. \nSulfur dioxide (SO ) and particulates produced through coal combustion are two major air \n2\npollutants, resulting in the formation of acid rain, which now falls on about 30% of the PRC's total \n ", "  3 \nlandmass.  From  a  long-term  global  perspective,  the  main  environmental  problem  is  GHG \nemission.3 \n \n3.  District Cooling in the PRC \n9.  In the PRC, air conditioners supply the cooling needs of households and industries. \nEnergy demand for cooling is growing rapidly to support the living standards of the large \npopulation. During the 1990s, household electricity consumption tripled, growing by an annual \naverage of 14%. Improving the energy efficiency of air-conditioning systems, which on hot \nsummer days account for up to 40% of major cities' entire power load, is one of the most effective \nmeasures the municipalities can take to decrease energy usage and mitigate air pollution, given \nthat 82% of electricity is now produced by burning coal. District cooling is an untapped area of \nenergy efficiency in the PRC; its use improves energy efficiency, flexibility, and reliability with \nsharing redundancy ensures minimum disruption. Economies of scale result in the need for less \nequipment by grouping of small equipments and sharing of redundant capacity, lower manpower \nrequirement, and also less maintenance costs. Each building can access the capacity needed \nand  reduce  its  initial  capital  investment,  operation,  and  management.  Furthermore,  space \nformerly occupied by ventilating and air-conditioning equipment will be available for commercial \nuse.  \n4.  Policies and Regulations \n10.  In the 1980s, the PRC Government began studying and making efforts to address the \nchallenges of prospective energy supply shortages and environmental degradation stemming \nfrom  the  PRC\u2019s  fast-growing  economy.  The  Government  recognizes  district  heating  as  an \nimportant area for reform because of its significant impact on energy conservation, air pollution, \nand standard of living. Since 1986 the PRC has strengthened the regulatory framework to \nencourage,  support,  and  develop  district  heating  emphasizing  on  CHP  as  the  preferred \ntechnology. Provisional Ordinance on Energy Saving and Management in 1986 demanded that \nurban heating should choose more efficient production processes or advanced equipments to \nreplace inefficient systems. Soon after, the State Council issued Special Order No. 22 in 1986, \noutlining a policy encouraging the rebuilding of urban district heating using CHP to replace small \ncoal-fired heating boilers and household stoves.    \n \n11.  With the recent energy intensity4 increase since 2001, the Government recognizes the \nurgent need to invest in and significantly improve energy efficiency. From its previous emphasis \non energy exploitation, the national energy policy now assigns top priority to energy conservation \nand energy efficiency. Expanding investment in energy efficiency projects is a high priority for \nenvironmental sustainability and enterprise competitiveness. The Government seeks to promote \nmarket-based methods to deliver and finance energy efficiency projects in partnership with the \nprivate sector.  \n \n12.  In  2003,  the  Ministry  of  Construction  (MOC),  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission (NDRC), State Environmental Protection Administration, and five other central \ngovernment agencies jointly issued a document (MOC[2003]-148) for heating system reform.  \nThe objectives are to (i) gradually transform current welfare-based heating services to be more \nmarket-oriented consistent with the PRC\u2019s socialist market economic development; (ii) continue \n                                                 \n3  Energy consumption accounts for more than 80% of the PRC\u2019s GHG emissions. Emissions of carbon from coal \ncombustion are estimated to increase from 820 million tons in 2000 to more than 1.1 billion tons in 2010 and more \nthan 1.8 billion tons in 2020 if environmental issues are not properly addressed. Even then PRC\u2019s CO  emissions \n2\nper capita would amount to only 20% of that of OECD countries in 2010 and 30% in 2020. \n4  Energy intensity is calculated as units of energy per unit of GDP. \n ", "4   \nto develop and implement more efficient heating technologies and energy-efficient buildings; and \n(iii) develop a healthy urban heating service system to meet demand for increased quality of \nliving standards, and support sustainable urban development in the PRC. Activities include (i) \ntransforming the welfare-based heating services system to a commodity-based heating service \nsystem; (ii) improving the efficiency of heat supply, transmission, distribution, and building heat \nconsumption; (iii) reducing the environmental impacts of urban heating; (iv) continuing to expand \neconomic, safe, environmentally compatible, and highly efficient central urban heating systems; \nand (v) accelerating reform, introducing competition, and developing a commercial urban heating \nservice market.  \n \n13.  The  11th  Five-Year  Plan  (2006\u20132010)  strengthens  the  policy  orientation  to  energy \nconservation, high-efficiency use, and energy security. The large energy efficiency potential is \nseen as a great opportunity to obtain some flexibility in the PRC\u2019s dependency on external \nsources of energy. By 2010, the Government aims to improve energy intensity by 20% and \nreduce SO  emissions by 10% compared with 2005 levels. Achieving these targets requires \n2\nmajor policy changes that would revitalize investment in energy efficiency throughout the PRC. A \nnumber of steps have been taken to support this target. During the 11th Five-Year Plan period \n(2006\u20132010), the PRC aims to increase heat supply from CHP in district heating systems from \n20% to 50% and increase district heating market penetration from 30% to 50%.  \n \n14.  The Medium- and Long-Term Energy Conservation Plan highlights key sectors and \nprovides a conceptual road map for improving energy efficiency. The plan puts forward 10 \nspecific types of energy efficiency projects, and identifies district heating and CHP generation as \none of the key fields of energy conservation. Specifically, it aims to replace the current heat \nsupply generated by scattered small coal-burning boilers with district heating using CHP units \nwith environmental protection features. It plans to achieve annual energy savings of 35 million \ntons of coal equivalent (tce) by 2020.  \n \n15.  In 2007, the NDRC and MOC jointly issued Interim Measures for the Price Control of \nUrban Heat Supply,5 which guides the pricing of heat supplies in urban administrative areas. It \nstates that the state further encourages private investors to invest in CHP and district heat supply \nfacilities, constructions, and operations. Urban heat price comprises the cost of heat supply, \ntaxes, and profit. The heat supplier can request tariff increases to maintain an adequate profit.  \n \n5.  Private Sector Participation \n16.  Under the central Government\u2019s guidance, many cities are obligated to close down \ndecentralized small heat-only boilers completely by 2010 and connect the associated heated \narea to the centralized DES. To replace small boilers with more energy\u2013efficient CHP generation \nfacilities, the pipeline network should be rehabilitated and expanded so that the CHP can be fully \nutilized. This will require an investment of CNY200 billion over the next 5 years. Many cities are \nhaving difficulty in securing adequate funding.  \n \n17.  Involving the private sector in the modernization of the management of district heating \nmanagement companies is acknowledged as a priority to achieve the energy\u2013saving objectives \nand profitability allowing further investment in infrastructure. The Government has taken active \nsteps to develop more uniform policies to promote a market orientation and the use of more \nenergy\u2013efficient technologies. Moreover, complementary reforms in housing and construction, \nsuch as higher standards for heat efficiency in new buildings and a shift to individually owned \n                                                 \n5  Measures issued by NDRC have the force of law in the PRC.  \n ", "  5 \nhousing  units,  was  implemented  in  order  to  improve  operator  revenues.  The  Government \nrecently  stepped  up  efforts  to  encourage  private  sector  participation  in  district  heating \ninfrastructure as one of the priorities in the restructuring of state-owned enterprises. In 2003 the \nGovernment opened up the district heating market to foreign investors to obtain operational \nknow-how and private sector capital. \n \nB.  Asian Development Bank Operations \n1.  Country Strategy \n18.  ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC6 is based on four development thrusts: \n(I) inclusive  growth  and  balanced  development,  (ii)  resource  efficiency  and  environmental \nsustainability, (iii) regional cooperation and public goods, and (iv) an environment conducive to \nprivate sector development.   \n \n19.  The PRC has been steadily transforming into a market economy, which has become the \nbasis and driving force for economic growth and job creation. In addition to ADB\u2019s policy advice \nto the Government on private sector development, ADB also provides project-based financial \nassistance. ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC have focused on the infrastructure and \nenergy sectors, the financial sector, and environmental improvements. In the infrastructure and \nenergy sectors, ADB prioritizes pioneering projects with innovative contractual and financial \nstructuring  to  encourage  private  sector  participation,  enhance  management  expertise,  and \nimprove corporate governance. As agreed with the Government, ADB private sector operations \nwill identify and support viable projects that are located in the less-developed central and \nwestern regions, and explore the possibility of using proceeds of yuan-denominated bonds for \nlending to local borrowers.  \n \n2.  Medium-Term Strategy II  \n20.  ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II (2006\u20132008) seeks more directly to help developing \nmember countries acquire low-carbon technologies, and to implement energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy projects to enable Asia to take the technology leap. Catalyzing investment to \nimprove  the  investment  climate,  expanding  private  sector  operations,  and  managing  the \nenvironment are also priorities. \n \n3.  Energy Sector Strategy \n21.  ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy supports, as operational priorities, (i) poverty reduction \nthrough such means as energy infrastructure development for sustainable economic growth and \nincreased access to energy for the poor, particularly in rural areas; (ii) private sector involvement \nthrough energy sector restructuring and the creation of an enabling environment for the private \nsector to invest and operate; (iii) regional and global environmental impact through measures \nthat  address  acid  rain  problems  and  promote  the  use  of  clean  energy;  and  (iv)  regional \ncooperation. The ongoing review of ADB\u2019s energy policy is expected to recommend a greater \nfocus on energy efficiency. In its public sector operations, ADB is involved in a number of efforts \nto help improve the heating system in the PRC. \n \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy (2008\u20132010): People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n ", "6   \n4.  The Energy Efficiency Initiative \n22.  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Efficiency  Initiative  (EEI)  aims  to  expand  ADB  operations  in  energy \nefficiency and clean energy to at least $1 billion a year, according to the general framework for \nthe implementation of EEI. The EEI task force identified the PRC as a priority developing \nmember country with the highest potential in the Asia and Pacific region for energy efficiency and \nclean energy investments. The task force has been holding consultative meetings in the PRC to \nlearn  firsthand  from  energy  efficiency  market  stakeholders  about  immediate  investment \nopportunities and barriers in the PRC market as a prerequisite for developing energy efficiency \nprojects. EEI consultations confirmed that many different approaches are needed to access \nvarious segments with significant energy efficiency potential.  \n \nIII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Description \n23.  The Project involves the establishment, acquisition, rehabilitation, and operation of DES \nCHP technologies, where possible, to address operational inefficiency and financial constraints \nfaced  by  municipalities\u2014two  key  obstacles  to  DES  market  development  in  the  PRC.  The \nproposed ADB loan will support the investment plan of Dalkia SAS (Dalkia, the Guarantor) to \nrehabilitate and expand DES in municipalities through joint ventures with local partners across \nthe PRC. Those joint ventures will provide DES services to residential clients and industrial and \ncommercial businesses. The impact of the Project is twofold: (i) to provide access to clean, \nreliable, safe, and high\u2013quality heating and cooling services to the municipalities, and (ii) to \nexpand private sector investment in DES projects in the PRC, thereby achieving large-scale \nenergy efficiency improvements and associated reduction in the growth of GHG and other \npollutants. \n \nB.  Dalkia Group \n24.  Founded in 1860, Dalkia is the world\u2019s leading DES management and maintenance \ncompany employing more than 50,000 people in 40 countries. The company\u2019s core value is \n\u201coptimizing energy in cities\u201d. With energy\u2013efficient and environment\u2013friendly solutions, Dalkia \noptimizes  the  technical,  financial,  and  environmental  performance  of  the  facilities  which  it \nmanages on behalf of local authorities and businesses. Its primary business is that of an \noperating engineer; it designs, constructs, operates and manages energy facilities throughout \nthe energy chain from production to consumption. Based on audited financial statements for \nFY2006, Dalkia has the total equity of \u20ac2.1 billion and the total assets of \u20ac7.1 billion.  \n \n1.  Shareholders \n25.  Dalkia is owned by Veolia Environment (Veolia) (66%) and by \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France (EDF) \n(34%). Dalkia is one of Veolia\u2019s four divisional companies7 and is in charge of energy. In 2000, \nVeolia and EDF merged their energy service business, giving EDF a 34% stake in the company.   \n \n                                                 \n7  Veolia has four divisional companies by sector\u2013 energy (Dalkia), water, transport, and waste management. In 2006, \nDalkia's revenue made up 21.4% of Veolia's total revenue, and assets 17.8%. \n ", "  7 \n2.  Operations \n26.  Dalkia\u2019s main services include thermal and multitechnical services, heating and cooling \nnetworks,  industrial  utilities,  installation,  comprehensive  building  management,  industrial \nmaintenance, and public lighting services. It manages 96,000 sites worldwide with 83,400 MW of \ntotal heating capacity, and 6,266 MW of power production capacity, including 709 MW of \nrenewable energy facilities.  \n \n27.  Following the Government\u2019s 2003 policy to introduce private sector participation in DES, \nDalkia Asia Pte Ltd (Dalkia Asia), a subsidiary of Dalkia, launched its operations in the PRC as \none of the first foreign companies authorized to own and operate district heating networks.  \n \n28.  Dalkia will support the operation and maintenance of the joint ventures through technical \n(design,  operations,  information  technology,  maintenance),  legal  (contract  drafting,  deal \nstructuring), financial (equity contribution, financial guarantee), accounting (accounting tool and \nexpertise, tax advice), and human resource support (secondment of staff, sharing good practice, \ntraining).  \n \nC.  Environmental Aspects and Social Dimensions \n1.  Environment, Safety, and Health \n29.  Municipal  DES  projects  including  CHP  abide  by  national,  provincial,  and  municipal \nenvironmental laws. Dalkia duly applies for all permits required to implement the projects and \noperate project facilities. The design, construction, and operation are required by law to strictly \nfollow safety standards and practices that are well-established by professional institutions in the \nindustry worldwide. The controlling authorities periodically monitor safety aspects. The municipal \ngovernment or Dalkia conducts an environmental impact assessment for all projects when \nrequired. Due diligence was conducted on the environmental, safety, and health aspects of \ncurrent operations of Dalkia\u2019s joint ventures to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s safeguard policies.  \n \n30.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  FI.  To  comply  with  ADB\u2019s \nenvironmental safeguards requirements, Dalkia will ensure that the joint ventures set up an \nenvironmental management system for new projects to be funded by ADB loans, including \nenvironmental assessment and review procedures for potential investments acceptable to ADB. \nADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines (2003) and Environment Policy (2002) and the \nPRC\u2019s  environmental  laws  and  regulations  will  be  complied  with  and  implementation  of \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  will  be  monitored  in  collaboration  with  municipal \nenvironmental protection bureaus. Such environmental mitigation measures will be included in \nprogress reports on project implementation with reporting requirements appropriate to subproject \nclassification, such as semiannual reports on environmental monitoring to be submitted to ADB \nfor review.  \n \n2.  Clean Development Mechanism \n31.  Energy savings provide opportunities to reduce GHG emissions such as CO  and have \n2\nthe potential to generate carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The \nCDM is an offset arrangement under the Kyoto Protocol that allows buyers in the industrialized \ncountries with GHG reduction commitment to purchase carbon credits from developing countries, \nsuch as the PRC, to meet their commitment in achieving global GHG emission reduction. The \nProject will seek assistance from ADB\u2019s Carbon Market Initiative for this purpose. \n ", "8   \n3.  Resettlement \n32.  The Project is classified as involuntary resettlement category B/C and indigenous people \ncategory C. CHP facilities will be constructed on land allocated by the municipal government and \nlocated in an area designated as a development zone. Expansion of district heating systems will \nbe carried out under existing public roads. In cases where a new CHP facility is constructed, \nlaying  of  pipes  to  connect  to  the  existing  pipeline  network  may  require  very  limited  land \nacquisition or entail temporary site impacts. Land acquisition or changes in land use are normally \ncarried out by the municipal governments before the concessions are opened to the private \nsector for competition. Dalkia thus has a limited direct role in land acquisition, and only in rare \ncases will Dalkia be directly involved in resettlement planning and implementation. Nonetheless, \nfor ADB-financed projects, Dalkia, together with the relevant joint ventures, will work with the \nmunicipal government to prepare a resettlement plan and ensure that all land acquisition and \nresettlement activities are undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy \n(1995) requirements; national laws; and provincial, municipal and county level regulations and \nordinances. Prior to investing in concessions, Dalkia will assess the social impacts in accordance \nwith ADB social development and safeguard requirements. In cases in which land acquisition \nhas taken place in anticipation of its investments using ADB loan proceeds, Dalkia will undertake \ndue  diligence  to  ensure  no  issues  are  outstanding  regarding  the  municipal  governments\u2019 \nacquisition of rights to land or displacement of people or enterprises. The land acquisition and \nresettlement framework sets out the procedures, roles, and responsibilities for ensuring that \nDalkia  fully  complies  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  joint  ventures  that  will  utilize  ADB  loan \nproceeds.  \n \nD.  Development Impacts \n33.  The Project will promote economic growth and environmental improvement in the PRC \nthrough improved energy efficiency in DES. The impacts of improving energy efficiency will \ndecrease the growth rate of GHG emissions, increase energy services, and improve energy \nsecurity. Specifically, the Project will (i) improve environmental conditions through improved \nenergy  efficiency,  support  Government  efforts  to  rebuild  more  energy-efficient  DES  in \nmunicipalities, and accelerate rehabilitation and expansion of DES infrastructure through private \nsector participation; (ii) improve access to clean, reliable, safe and high-quality heating and \ncooling  services  to  the  people  in  municipalities  in  the  PRC;  and  (iii)  demonstrate  that \npublic\u2013private partnership for DES projects are efficient, and thus encourage the private sector \nand municipalities to invest in DES projects beyond the Project\u2019s interventions. \n \nE.  Development Effectiveness \n34.  The  development  impact  of  the  Project  will  be  assessed  from  the  perspective  of \ndevelopment effectiveness and project framework, and its contribution to economic sustainability \nand private sector development in accordance with the guidelines for the implementation of the \nGood Practice Standards for Evaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations prepared by the \nMultilateral Development Banks\u2019 Evaluation Cooperation Group.8 The Project is deemed to be \ndevelopmentally effective and its performance measurable. A summary discussion of each of \nthese assessment parameters follows. \n \n                                                 \n8 Multilateral Development Banks-Evaluation Cooperation Group. 2006. MDB-ECG Good Practice Standards for \nEvaluation of Private Sector Investment Operations. Third Edition. \n ", "  9 \n1.  Project Performance \n35.  The Project will be assessed against its specific investment capital, construction, and \noperational and financial objectives. Essentially, effectiveness will be measured against how \nsuccessfully the Project attracts private sector capital, secures DES concessions, and develops \nand expands municipal DES; and how much heating and cooling the Project supplies to end \nusers and industries. Financial profitability and sustainability of the Project will be measured by \nits timely debt repayment capacity. \n   \n2.  Economic Sustainability \n36.  The Project will be assessed from an economic sustainability perspective on its ability to \ndevelop and implement municipal DES, supply municipal heating and cooling to the end users \nand  industries,  and  contribute  to  environmental  improvements  and  economic  growth.  The \nProject\u2019s successful implementation will impact the promotion of heating reform. \n   \n3.  Private Sector Development \n37.  The  Project  will  be  assessed  and  measured  on  its  contribution  to  private  sector \ndevelopment. The focus of this assessment will be on the Project\u2019s commercial and financial \nviability, and its demonstrative and catalytic effect on future private sector developments in DES \nitself and the economy as a whole. \n \n38.  The Project was not specifically assessed from the perspective of investment profitability, \nas a profitability assessment is better gauged and measured against a portfolio of similar loans \nand equity investments. Similarly, the Project was not assessed and measured against overall \noperational effectiveness, as this is a departmental consideration.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ASSISTANCE \nA.  Loan \n39.  ADB\u2019s proposed loan comprise an A Loan of up to CNY1.4 billion funded by ADB and a B \nloan  of  up  to  CNY1.4  billion  funded  by  international  or  local  banks,  to  the  joint  ventures \nestablished  by  Dalkia  Asia  and  local  partners.  The  loan  will  have  an  interest  rate  to  be \ndetermined by the Pricing and Credit Enhancement Committee. The Borrowers may have the \nright to convert the interest rate from a floating rate to a fixed rate and vice versa on terms \nagreed between ADB and the Borrowers. \n \n40.  The B loan of up to CNY1.4 billion will have terms and conditions agreed upon by the \nBorrowers, the participating banks and ADB. ADB will charge an arrangement fee and annual \nadministration fee determined by the Pricing and Credit Enhancement Committee. \n \n41.  The financing documentation will contain financial and operational covenants, including \nregular financial and operational monitoring reports and requirements to meet minimum financial \nratios.  \n \n ", "10   \nB.  Justification \n42.  ADB\u2019s assistance for the Project is justified on the basis of its development impacts and \ndemonstration effects. It supports the Government\u2019s development plans and ADB\u2019s operational \nstrategies, and provides value added of ADB participation in the Project: \n \n(i)  The Project will provide access to clean, reliable, safe, and high-quality heating \nand  cooling  services  to  the  people  living  in  municipalities  where  adequate \nmunicipal DES infrastructure is lacking and demand is currently not fully met. The \nProject  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  strategic  priorities  for  energy  and  the \nenvironment as set forth in the 11th Five-Year Plan as well as Medium- and \nLong-Term  Energy  Conservation  Plan  to  improve  the  energy  efficiency.  The \nProject will reduce particulates and SO  from scattered small coal-fired heat-only \n2\nboilers and inefficient district heating networks. This will have the most benefits for \nthe urban population, in particular the urban poor, who suffer severely from indoor \nand outdoor air pollution.  \n \n(ii)  The Project is consistent with ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC, which \nhave focused on private sector participation in the infrastructure and energy \nsectors, financial sector, and environmental improvements. In the infrastructure \nand  energy  sectors,  ADB  prioritizes  pioneering  participation,  enhancing \nmanagement expertise, and improving corporate governance. This Project will \nprovide highly skilled employment and know-how transfer opportunity to the local \ncommunity.  \n \n(iii)  The Project will embody ADB\u2019s country strategy for the PRC, which emphasizes \nsupporting  environmental  improvement  and  private  sector  participation.  The \nProject  is  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  energy  sector  strategy,  which  recommends  a \nreorientation  of  energy  sector  activities  to  address  regional  and  global \nenvironmental impact. By introducing energy efficiency, the Project will contribute \nto mitigating climate change. The Project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s credit \nenhancement operations policy and EEI. \n \n(iv)  As the first private sector district energy project supported by ADB, the Project is \ndemonstrational  and  catalytic.  It  sets  a  model  for  private  sector  investment, \nincluding strengthening ties between the leading international investor and local \nmunicipalities and service providers, to fill in the gap between the substantial level \nof investment required for DES projects and limited financing capacity. ADB\u2019s \nparticipation in the Project is expected to establish more confidence in future \nprivate sector participation in DES projects based on public\u2013private partnerships \nin the PRC. \n \nC.  Anticorruption, Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n43.  Dalkia was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and policy \nrelating  to  the  Combating  of  Money  Laundering  and  the  Financing  of  Terrorism  (2003). \nConsistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will \nrequire Dalkia, and its subsidiaries to institute, maintain, and comply with internal procedures \nand  controls  following  international  best  practice  standards  for  the  purpose  of  preventing \ncorruption or money laundering activities or the financing of terrorism, and covenant with ADB to \n ", "  11 \nrefrain from engaging in such activities. The loan documentation between ADB and Dalkia will \nfurther allow ADB to investigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n44.  Consistent  with  the  Agreement  Establishing  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  the \nGovernment will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed loan. No \nfunding will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation.  \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n45.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB, \nand recommend that the Board approve a loan of up to CNY2,800,000,000 to the joint ventures \nestablished  by  Dalkia  Asia  and  local  partners  to  finance  the  Municipal  District  Energy \nInfrastructure Development Project, consisting of \n \n(i)  an A loan funded by ADB in an amount up to CNY1,400,000,000, to be provided \nfrom ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources without government guarantee; and  \n \n(ii)  a  B  loan  funded  by  international  or  local  banks  in  an  amount  up  to \nCNY1,400,000,000 on terms and conditions to be mutually agreed upon between \nthe borrowers, the participating banks, and ADB, \n \nand on such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in \nthis report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n         Haruhiko Kuroda \n         President \n \n28 April 2008\n ", "12  Appendix 1   \nFRAMEWORK FOR
