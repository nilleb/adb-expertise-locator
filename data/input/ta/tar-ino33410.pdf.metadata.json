During the 2002 country programming mission, the Government of the Republic of \nIndonesia  requested  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  reclamation  and \nmanagement  of  degraded  land  project,  aimed  at  reducing  poverty  and  improving  natural \nresource management, enhancing local capacity, and ensuring the active participation of local \ncommunities. The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Indonesia in June 2002 to develop the scope \nof work and implementation arrangements with the Government. The mission held detailed \ndiscussions  with  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  and  various \ndepartments  of  the  ministries  of  home  affairs  (MOHA),  forestry  (MOF),  agriculture  (MOA), \nenvironment (MOE), and finance, as well other relevant agencies, on the rationale, objectives, \nscope,  cost  estimates,  implementation  arrangements,  and  financing  plan  for  the  TA.  The \nMission  also  met  with  representatives  of  external  funding  agencies,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGO) and stakeholders to discuss the TA. The TA has been designed to be in \nline with the Government's priorities and anticipated initiatives, as well as with the current \nemphasis in Indonesia of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The TA is included in ADB's \n2002 country assistance program for Indonesia.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Indonesia has the second largest expanse of tropical moist forests in the world, but \nthese  forests  are  under  considerable  pressure  from  human  development.  Official  figures \nestimate that the remaining forest cover is between 92 and 112 million hectares (ha) out of a \ntotal of about 144 million ha classified as forestland (about 75% of Indonesia\u2019s land area of 192 \nmillion ha). An estimated 50 million people are dependent on forests for all or part of their \nlivelihoods. These forests are important to Indonesia for their economic and social significance \nand to the global community for their biodiversity and as a carbon sink. The official rate of \ndeforestation is quoted to be 1.5 million ha per year, much of which has been attributed to large-\nscale commercial operations. Illegal logging has also become pervasive, and a large portion of \ndomestic consumption of logs is met from such activities. Overcapacity in the pulp and paper \nindustry has been blamed for the increase in demand. On the positive side, interest in and \nacceptance of community participation in forest and land management is increasing and seen \nas a possible means to counter deforestation. Yet, many policy, legal, and institutional issues \nremain to be addressed within the context of the recent decentralization of government to the \nkabupaten (district) level. \n  \n3.  About 20 million ha of Indonesia\u2019s lands are classified as seriously degraded or \u201ccritical \nclass I\u201d lands, which range in size from small areas (less than 100 ha) to tens of thousands of \nhectares, distributed throughout the country. These areas, the majority of which lie within or on \nthe borders of forest land, have been rendered degraded through land clearing for various forms \nof agriculture, overexploitative logging, forest and land fires,2 mining, and the practice of slash \nand  burn  agriculture.  Very  large  areas  of  degraded  lands  cleared  of  forest  cover  under \ncommercial concessions have not been replanted. Degraded lands have been largely overrun \nwith imperata species of grasses, locally known as alang-alang, which have limited productivity \nand are highly susceptible to fire. The Government recognizes the need to rehabilitate degraded \nforestlands and to restore the productivity and management of critical watersheds to keep pace \nwith  economic  development.  Over  the  last  decade,  Indonesia\u2019s  forestry  action  plans  have \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in May 2002. \n2  Some 9.7 million ha of forest and peat land were burned by uncontrolled fires in 1997\u20131998. Over 700 million tons \nof carbon dioxide was released into the atmosphere, elevating Indonesia to one of the world\u2019s largest polluters. \nADB provided assistance to address this issue. (ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for \nPlanning for Fire Prevention and Drought Management. Manila. TA 2955-INO.) \n ", "2       \n     \n     \nidentified land rehabilitation as a priority issue. However, district, subdistrict, and village level \nforest management institutions are weak or do not exist, and considerable opportunities exist for \nstrengthening  community-based  management  and  promoting  socially  and  environmentally \nsustainable management of forest and land resources. \n \n4.  Rural communities living on the margins of the forests often exhibit high levels of poverty \nand depend on forest resources for their subsistence. The subsistence needs of these rural \ncommunities  are  increasingly  threatened  through  the  degradation  of  forests,  and  these \ncommunities often resort to illegal logging or increase the areas under slash and burn to \nsurvive. The poor are particularly disadvantaged because they have little influence on how \npublic forestland is allocated and managed, few institutions represent their interests, and their \ntraditional (adat) land rights have been eroded. Increasing population pressure, coupled with \neconomic and forest use rights uncertainties, has exacerbated the situation, resulting in a \ncontinued expansion of degraded forests and watersheds.  \n \n5.  Decentralization and devolution of authority to local governments has increased the \nneed and urgency to address the degradation of forests and watersheds. Under the Regional \nAutonomy  Act  (Law  22/1999),  provincial,  district,  and  municipal  governments  were  given \nautonomous powers to manage the environment and natural resources within their respective \njurisdictions, with the national agencies empowered to uphold national standards and facilitate \nthe  implementation  of  decentralization.  Similarly,  the  Forestry  Affairs  Law  (Law  41/1999) \nprovides for local government management of forests. Law 41/1999 also provides the basis for \ncommunity participation in forest management. Although a number of issues were addressed \nthrough the adoption of Regulation 25/2000 covering the implementing regulations of Law \n22/1999,  many  aspects  of  decentralization  still  remain  unclear,  particularly  the  division  of \nresponsibilities between provincial and district/municipal levels. Concerted efforts are needed to \nenhance local government capacity and empower local communities to actively participate in \nthe rehabilitation and management of degraded areas, to ensure that rehabilitation takes place, \nand to ensure that these areas do not continue to grow. \n \n6.  Unofficial estimates of NGOs and some external agencies presently put the rate of \ndeforestation as high as 2 million ha per year, and increasing. Such rates will lead to increasing \nloss of permanent forest cover and biodiversity, and a higher risk of damage by fires, and place \nprotected forest areas under increasing threat. Many local agencies, local and international \nNGOs and civil society are vocal about these concerns, and actively promote the rights of \ncommunities,  particularly  indigenous  peoples,  to  participate  in  forest  and  degraded  land \nmanagement.  A  number  of  successful  community-managed  forest  and  land  rehabilitation \nprojects exist, and MOHA and MOF, together with local government, are looking at ways to \nexpand  these  activities.  International  organizations,  including  the  International  Center  for \nResearch in Agro-Forestry and the Center for International Forestry Research, are active in \npromoting participatory research in this area. \n \n7.  Since 1985, ADB provided 11 loans amounting to $309.9 million to the forestry sector in \nIndonesia. ADB\u2019s grant-funded TA has also covered a range of forestry sector issues including \ntimber estates, rattan plantations, plywood, institutional strengthening, environmental impact \nassessment, watershed management, biodiversity conservation, mangroves, remote sensing, \nand protected area management. In addition, many ADB-financed projects in the agriculture and \nnatural resources sectors have included components to address watershed management and \nprotection and land resource planning, and to develop tree crops and agro-forestry. Other \nexternal agencies involved in ongoing funding of forestry sector projects include the World \nBank-Global Environment Fund (GEF), the European Union and many of its member countries \n(Denmark,  Germany,  the  Netherlands,  Sweden,  and  the  United  Kingdom)  the  Japan \n   ", "  3\nInternational Cooperation Agency, the United States Agency for International Development, and \nthe Korean International Cooperation Agency. An active Forestry Sector Working Group under \nthe Consultative Group for Indonesia brings together representatives of the external agencies \nand international NGOs on a regular basis to discuss common issues and concerns, and share \ninformation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to prepare a feasibility study for an investment project with the \noverall objective of reducing poverty in poor rural communities on degraded lands, focusing on \nareas with a high level of poverty. Specifically, the investment project will address the pressing \nissue  of  land  rehabilitation  and  sustainable  management,  through  community  and  local \ngovernment participation. The TA will (i) provide an overview of the problems and causes of \nland  degradation;  (ii)  describe  the  long-term  objectives  of  the  land  rehabilitation  and \nmanagement project; (iii) develop, to prefeasibility level, a phased long-term program for land \nrehabilitation and management; (iv) prepare a detailed feasibility study for an investment project \nfor the first (5\u20137 year) phase, with detailed cost estimates and implementation arrangements at \ndecentralized levels of administration; (v) propose criteria for selection and prioritization of target \ncommunities; and (vi) identify the potential sources of financing for the first phase, including \npossible co-financing under OP 123 of the GEF.  \n \n9.  The  TA  will  specifically  identify  and  address  (i)  the  social,  cultural,  agricultural, \ngeographical, historical, and other factors contributing to the formation degraded land, and the \nlinkages  with  rural  poverty;  (ii)  the  extent  and  distribution  of  degraded  land  suitable  for \nrehabilitation through community participation; (iii) the policy and legal framework relating to the \nrehabilitation and management of degraded forests; (iv) appropriate and acceptable land use \nrights  arrangements;  (v)  practical  options  for  the  rehabilitation  and  future  management  of \ndegraded forests and watersheds with active participation of local communities, in keeping with \nthe goals of poverty reduction; and (vi) the capacity-building and knowledge needs of target \ncommunities and the decentralized levels of government.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  proposed  rehabilitation  and  management  project  is  aimed  at  (i)  promoting \nsustainable land use and employment generation, with the goal of reducing the incidence of \npoverty; (ii) enhancing access to land and forest resources by local communities and their \nempowerment in land and forest management through appropriate forms of access rights and \nland tenure; (iii) increasing food and wood production to meet the needs of the local community \nand forest industry without compromising the sustainability of natural forests; (iv) promoting \nconservation of watersheds, biodiversity, and other functions of the forests for the country as a \nwhole; and (v) building capacity at the decentralized levels of government to manage and \nmonitor the process.  \n \n11.  Geographically, the TA will focus on poor communities in selected target areas in about \nfour provinces. The provinces will be selected during the initial stages of TA implementation, \nhave a high incidence of rural poverty, and likely exhibit differences in land rehabilitation needs \nand in the determinants of rural poverty. The lessons learned in reducing poverty through land \n                                                 \n3 Given the magnitude of land degradation, the solution will address the question of global climate change by \nestablishing carbon sinks (through reforestation and social forestry), and lead to conservation of biodiversity. As \nsuch, the activities will be in line with the objectives and rationale of GEF\u2019s Operational Program (OP) 12. \n   ", "4       \n     \n     \nrehabilitation in the target areas will be used to develop similar initiatives in other areas. The \nstudy will draw on available land-use mapping, statistical information and other resources, and \nthe TA will develop a geographic information system, producing printed maps at an appropriate \nscale.  \n \n12.  Many  community-based  schemes  relating  to  land  rehabilitation  and  management \npresently exist, including self-managed schemes, central and local government programs and \ninitiatives,  and  those  supported  by  external  agencies,  international  and  local  NGOs,  and \nagricultural and forestry research organizations. The TA will undertake a full review of these \nactivities, with the objective of selecting the most promising schemes as models for possible \nexpansion under the proposed investment project. Four to six poor communities will be targeted \nfor detailed study as examples of target communities for future participation in the investment \nproject. \n \n13.  Within each study community, the TA will use a participatory approach to examine the \nlivelihood constraints facing the rural poor, with particular emphasis on income, employment, \nagriculture,  forestry,  and  land  degradation.  The  TA  will  undertake  a  social  assessment  to \nevaluate the community\u2019s resources, social structure, knowledge, and skills base to identify the \nopportunities for community-based land rehabilitation and management.  \n \n14.  The  TA  will  identify  government  agencies  and  NGOs  to  provide  training,  capacity \nbuilding,  and  extension  activities  to  the  local  communities,  and  to  provide  complementary \ntraining to staff of local government agencies. The TA will also identify specific training activities \nto develop complementary income-generating activities. Special attention will be paid to the \nparticular needs of women with regard to these activities. A Preliminary Project Framework is \ngiven in Appendix 1. \n \n15.  The  resulting  investment  project  will  complement  and  strengthen  ongoing  activities \nfunded by the Government, external agencies, and NGOs in the forestry, natural resources, and \nagriculture sectors. In particular, the proposed activities will complement the EU-Indonesia \nForest  Program  (European  Union  financing),  environmental  protection  program  (Japan \nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  financing),  and  land  management  project  (United  States \nAgency  for  International  Development  financing).  These  activities  include  inventory  and \nmonitoring activities; forest management; forest fire prevention; protection of national parks; \ncritical  land  protection  and  rehabilitation;  biodiversity  conservation;  and  community \nempowerment for forest, agroforestry, and natural resources management. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent, of which $462,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $538,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will finance \n$800,000 equivalent, consisting of the entire foreign exchange costs and $338,000 equivalent of \nthe  local  currency  costs  on  a  grant  basis  from  the  Japan  Special  Fund,  funded  by  the \nGovernment of Japan. The Government will finance the remaining $200,000 equivalent of the \nlocal currency costs, and has assured the availability of counterpart services, facilities, and \nfunds by the expected commencement date of the TA. Detailed cost estimates are provided in \nAppendix 2. The Government understands that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance an ensuing project. \n \n   ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The Directorate of Natural Resources and Appropriate Technology within the Directorate \nGeneral of Rural Community Empowerment (DGRCE) of MOHA will be the Executing Agency \nfor the TA. DGRCE will work in close cooperation with MOA, MOF, MOE, and BAPPENAS (the \ncooperating agencies). DGRCE will appoint a project officer and appropriate counterparts for \nday-to-day  TA  coordination  under  the  direct  supervision  of  the  director  general,  DGRCE. \nCounterparts in DGRCE and the cooperating agencies will work closely with the consultants and \nhold particular responsibility for liaison with provincial and district governments in each of the \ntarget  provinces,  especially  with  regard  to  the  provision  of  local  counterparts  and  the \narrangement of field trips. DGRCE will also provide office accommodation and logistical support \nfor the TA study, and provide adequate budgetary support for its staff for travel and per diem. \nCoordination and collaboration with other external agencies, and other stakeholders, such as \nresearch institutions (e.g. the Center for International Forestry Research and the International \nCenter for Research in Agro-Forestry) may also be desirable.  \n \n18.  A  TA  coordination  committee  (TACC),  chaired  by  a  senior  officer  in  BAPPENAS, \nincluding senior representatives from MOHA, MOA, MOF, MOE, will be established to review \nthe progress and outputs of the TA, the target provinces, and the TA study districts. Stakeholder \ninput to the TACC will be achieved through the involvement of key individuals and/or NGOs \nrepresenting indigenous peoples and target communities, as appropriate. The TACC will meet \nat least once a month to provide active input to the TA. \n \n19.  Three  international  and  nine  domestic  consultants  will  be  engaged  through  an \ninternational consulting firm. A total of 19 person-months of international consulting and 45 \nperson-months of domestic consulting, for a total of 64 person-months will be required. The \nteam leader, an international consultant, will work full-time in Indonesia for the duration of the \nTA study. Expertise will be required in natural resource management, social studies and poverty \nreduction, community development, participation and institutional strengthening, agricultural and \nnatural  resource  economics,  geographic  information  system  /data  analysis,  forestry \nmanagement, agriculture, rural income generation, legal aspects of decentralization, land and \nforest management and spatial planning, environment, and benefit monitoring and evaluation. \nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants are provided in Appendix 3. The consultants \nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants using the \nquality-and-cost-based selection method, based on a simplified technical proposal and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. The TA will commence in \nFebruary 2003 and will be completed in August 2003.  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented in a fully participatory manner, and the consultants will \norganize at least two participatory stakeholder workshops during TA implementation to discuss \nthe approach and findings with key central, provincial, and district agencies; representatives of \ntarget communities; external agencies; NGOs; research organizations; and other interested \nparties. A Summary Initial Poverty and Social Analysis is given in Appendix 4. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Indonesia  for  preparing  the  Community-Based  Land  Rehabilitation  and \nManagement Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n   ", "6  Appendix 1     \n     \n     \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal (of Project)  (To be refined during TA)  (To be refined during TA)   \n   \nTo contribute to the dual  Reduced incidence of  National, regional, and  Continued and \nnational goals in Indonesia of:  poverty in target  local socioeconomic  consistent commitment \n  communities and districts  surveys and data  of government to \n- reducing poverty, and       poverty reduction \n  Reduced areas of degraded  Land use monitoring by   \n- rehabilitation and  land in target communities  remote sensing and land  Good governance and \nmanagement of degraded  and districts  use data collection  effective \nlands      decentralization \n     \n  Existence of appropriate \ngovernment policies \nand regulations, and \neffective implementation\nPurposes (of Project)  (To be refined during TA)  (To be refined during TA)   \n   \nTo provide livelihood and  Increased production of  Local trade and  Willingness of \nincome-generating  legal forest products and  production data  communities to \nopportunities for predominantly  food    participate in \npoor rural communities       community-managed \n  Increased access to land  Monitoring of number of  land reclamation \nTo develop the capability and  and resources by poor  community groups   \nability of communities to  communities, and sustained  formed, size of groups,  Effective technologies \nrehabilitate and sustainably  income for poor  and areas of reclaimed  and information \nmanage rehabilitated land  communities  land under legally  available to local \n    recognized community  communities \nTo develop sustainable  The creation and continued  management   \ninstitutional arrangements to  functioning of community    Effective \nprovide an appropriate  management groups   Monitoring of community  implementation of local \nenabling environment    income and activity  and national policies \nSustained institutional    and regulations \narrangements to support  Monitoring of local  conducive to \ncommunities in terms of  government funding and  community-based land \ngovernment and non- staffing, NGO activity, and  and resource \ngovernment support  existence of policy and  management \nregulations at district and \nprovincial level \nOutputs (of TA)       \nAn overview of land  Data on the location of  Regular TACC meetings  Timely TACC meetings, \ndegradation and poverty in  degraded land and    and TA supervision \nIndonesia, focusing on  incidence of poverty (at  TA inception, interim, and  missions \npredominantly poor  inception report stage)  final tripartite meetings \ncommunities   \n  Clarification of the program \nLong-term objectives of the  objectives and targets (at \nland rehabilitation and  interim report stage) \nmanagement program    \n  Completion of pre- and \nA long-term investment  detailed feasibility studies for \nprogram and a feasibility study  the program and project (at \nfor a first phase investment  draft final report stage) \nproject   \n  Acceptable and workable \nCriteria and mechanisms for  subproject selection criteria \ntargeting communities   and processes (at draft final \n  report stage) \nNGO = nongovernment organization, TA = technical assistance, TACC = technical assistance coordination committee. \n \n \n   ", "Appendix 1  7\n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nPotential sources of financing  Financing/co-financing for     \nfor the first phase  project implementation (at \ndraft final report stage) \nActivities (of TA)       \nAnalyze context of land  Preparation of TA inception,  Timely presentation of  Satisfactory \ndegradation in Indonesia.  interim, draft final and final  reports  performance of \n  reports.

General \n1.  The consulting team, comprising three international and nine domestic consultants, will \nwork in close collaboration with the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA); the ministries of forests, \nagriculture,  and  finance;  the  State  Ministry  of  Environment;  provincial  and  district \nadministrations in target areas; and other relevant Government agencies to prepare a proposed \ninvestment project. \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) will be implemented in a fully participatory manner, and \nthe  consultants  will  organize  at  least  two  participatory  stakeholder  workshops  during  TA \nimplementation to discuss the approach and findings with key central, provincial, and district \nagencies,  representatives  of  target  communities,  external  agencies,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGO), research organizations and other interested parties. \n \n3.  The inception phase of the TA will develop an overview of land degradation and poverty \nin Indonesia, the legal context, review the various approaches used to address the problems in \nrecent years, and select four to six sites for further in-depth study and analysis. The interim \nphase of the TA will examine the various approaches to land reclamation from a technical, \nenvironmental, social, and economic standpoint to ensure that the approaches are sound, \ndevelop and field test participatory processes, identify outside support and capacity building \nneeds, propose selection criteria for target communities, and identify possible target areas for \nimplementation of an investment project. The final phase of the TA will be to prepare a detailed \ninvestment project. Reports will be prepared during each phase for discussion at tripartite \nmeetings between the Government, the consultants, and ADB. \n \n4.  The consultants will submit 10 copies each of the inception, interim, and draft final report \nfor review, and 20 copies of the final report.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national    Sector identified as a national   \npriority in country poverty analysis?                Yes  priority in country poverty                                Yes \n  partnership agreement? \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \nRural poverty is high in Indonesia, with an estimated 20.2% of the rural population living below the poverty \nline, compared with 15.1% in urban areas (1999). Many communities, particularly those living on degraded lands on \nthe margins of forests, are particularly disadvantaged in terms of access to land and other resources, with poverty \nlevels as high as 80%. The purpose of the Project is to provide improved livelihood and sustained income generating \nopportunities to poor rural communities living on degraded lands, focusing on predominantly poor communities. This \nwill be accomplished through increased production and marketing of legal forest products and food as a result of \nincreased access to land and improved management of resources. The Project will focus on the creation of and \ncontinued support for community management groups, and sustained government and nongovernment institutional \narrangements to support communities.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: Core Poverty \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nDuring the initial phase of the PPTA, the consultants will compile available data on poverty and degraded \nlands, using GIS and poverty mapping techniques to link the information for use in selecting target provinces, \ndistricts, and communities, and to provide a baseline database for subsequent monitoring of the project. In addition, \nthe consultants will review and document ongoing and completed community-based land and natural resource \nmanagement activities to identify successful schemes, on the basis of which 4\u20136 sites will be selected for further in-\ndepth study as prototype subprojects. \nA poverty analysis will be undertaken to estimate the expected impact of project interventions on poor \ncommunities, other stakeholders (including intermediaries and NGOs), and government (distinguishing between the \nlocal and national governments). This will examine the distribution of project costs and benefits, in financial and \neconomic terms, allocated to the various stakeholders, and estimate the distribution of project effects to the poor to \ndetermine the poverty impact, as outlined in ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment in the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis: During the review of ongoing and completed schemes, the consultants will identify and \nconsult with all stakeholders, to determine the roles and functions of the target groups and to understand supply \nchains to markets for produce. In particular, the consultants will undertake a rapid rural appraisal or similar approach \nto gather background information on the study communities, meet with key individuals and the communities at large, \nand engage in dialogue to identify development needs and constraints. The outcome of this analysis will form the \nbasis for proposing selection criteria and specific mechanisms for community inclusion, and identifying target \ncommunities under the Project.  \n \nParticipation strategy required: The TA will be implemented in a fully participatory manner, and the consultants will \norganize at least two participatory stakeholder workshops during TA implementation to discuss the approach and \nfindings with key central, provincial, and district agencies; representatives of target communities, external agencies, \nNGOs, and research organizations; and other interested parties. \n \nD.
