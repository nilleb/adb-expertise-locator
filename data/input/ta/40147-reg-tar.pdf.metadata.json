The establishment of the East Asia Department has given the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) the opportunity to formulate and implement more focused regional cooperation programs \nbetween Mongolia and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). A concept paper was prepared for a \nnew regional technical assistance (RETA) project and was approved by the Vice President (Group \n2) in July 2006. The Fact-Finding Mission visited Beijing, Changchun and Harbin in the PRC and \nUlaanbaatar in Mongolia from 12\u201321 September 2006 to discuss issues to be covered under the \nRETA with government officials and other potential stakeholders and reached an understanding with \nthe  governments  of  Mongolia  and  the  PRC  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost,  financing \narrangements, terms of reference, and implementation arrangements for the RETA.1 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  One of the strategic priorities of ADB\u2019s second medium-term strategy is to mainstream \nsupport for regional cooperation and integration (RCI) programs and to use RCI to reinforce country-\nlevel efforts. The second medium-term strategy indicated that RCI, driven mainly by the market \nforces of trade and investment, would (i) enhance the growth potential of individual countries and \nstrengthen their capacity to reduce poverty; (ii) help link and better align the region\u2019s slower growing \ncountries with faster growing economies, thereby reducing intercountry disparities in the region; and \n(iii) also serve as a platform for regional level initiatives to manage cross-border environmental and \nhealth risks, as well as financial system integration. The RCI strategy, adopted in July 2006, further \ncommitted ADB to initiate collective regional actions.2  \n3.  The RETA will focus on an area that includes Mongolia and the PRC\u2019s northeast region.3 \nMongolia and the PRC have been active participants respectively in the Central Asia Regional \nEconomic Cooperation (CAREC) programs4 in three major areas, namely transport (especially road \ntransport), energy, and trade policy and trade facilitation. The PRC is also part of the Greater \nMekong Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program,5 which is active in priority sectors such \nas  transport,  telecommunications,  energy,  environment,  tourism,  trade  facilitation,  investment, \nhuman resource development, and agriculture.  \n4.  Mongolia and the PRC share common borders of several thousand kilometers. The volume \nof bilateral trade between Mongolia and the PRC was $323 million in 2000 and increased to $840 \nmillion in 2005. About half of Sino-Mongolian trade took place between bordering provinces of the \nrespective  countries.  Economic  development  in  the  bordering  regions  of  the  two  countries  is \ngenerally lagging behind that in other areas. There are strong complimentarities between the two \neconomies and regional trade and economic integration will be extremely beneficial. However, in \ncontrast to their close political relationship, Mongolian and the PRC trade and other economic \ncooperation  lack  both  depth  and  breadth.  This  is  largely  due  to  a  lack  of  basic  cross-border \ninfrastructure  and  numerous  bottlenecks  facing  the  transport  of  goods  and  trade  facilitation: \ndifference in procedures for immigration, customs, quarantine and other border controls; significant \ndifference in the level of availability of transport and of storage capacity of railways, resulting in \ncongestion and delays at borders; the basic nature of the composition of trade and the types of trade \n                                                           \n1  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 25 September 2006. \n2  That  will  enhance  physical  connectivity;  expand  trade  and  investment;  develop  financial  systems;  promote \nmacroeconomic and financial stability; and improve environmental, health, and social conditions. \n3  Including the three northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous \nRegion.  \n4  The program covers Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, the PRC, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan (an \nobserver in some initiatives), and Uzbekistan. \n5  Which covers Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, PRC, Thailand, and Viet Nam. ", "2   \ntransactions;6 a  lack  of utilization  of  free  trade  zones,  technological  cooperation, foreign  direct \ninvestment, and labor cooperation; and lack of a broad and effective trade framework in existence in \nthe subregion.  \n5.  The regional transport system in Mongolia and the PRC plays a critical role in relation to \neconomic  development  in  the  region.  Both  Mongolia  and  the  PRC\u2019s  northeastern  region7 are \nlandlocked and need strategically placed and efficiently run transport systems to connect with major \nmarkets. Changes in the economic development scenario in Mongolia and the PRC also provide \nnew opportunities and challenges to the region\u2019s transport system. A range of proposals for road \nand railways projects have recently been prepared, some of which would compete with each other. \nMany of these need to be critically reviewed. This RETA will build on the transport assessment \nundertaken  by  two  earlier  RETAs8 and  will  take  careful  account  of  environmental  issues  in \ndeveloping recommendations.  \n6.  Most of Mongolia\u2019s exports to the PRC and other parts of the world and transit trade through \nMongolia are shipped via railway through the Zamyn-Uud\u2013Erenhot border post and from there to the \nport at Tianjin. However the railway from Erenhot to Tianjin is congested, and because of the \nshortage of railway wagons, goods transported to Erenhot by rail often have to be transported to \nTianjin by road. The Government of Mongolia is therefore interested in examining alternative routes \nto the sea. One such route is through Mongolia\u2019s eastern provinces to the PRC at Arxan, continuing \nto Changchun and Hunchun, and eventually linking to the Russian port of Zarubino. Another route \nwould involve connecting to the Russian railway network and entering the PRC at Manzhouli, \ncontinuing on to Harbin and Mudanjiang, and eventually linking to the Russian port of Vladivostok. \nThe three northeastern provinces of the PRC currently use the seaport in Dalian in the province of \nLiaoning, but the rail link to Dalian is heavily congested. The Government of the PRC has been \ntrying to take a proactive approach to develop the northeastern region, including establishing an \nalternative route to the sea by using the Russian ports of Vladivostok and Zarubino. Considerable \nPRC  domestic  shipments  already  use  the  Harbin\u2013Mudanjiang\u2013Vladivostok  route  to  southern \nChinese ports, and the PRC customs authorities recently assigned a special code for such domestic \nshipments via foreign ports. \n7.  Both the Government of Mongolia and the provincial governments of the PRC\u2019s northeastern \nprovinces  have  started  to  formulate  strategies  and  develop  transportation  master  plans  for \nrehabilitating existing roads and railway networks and constructing new ones aimed at creating \neconomic  corridors  and  providing  alternative  access  to  the  sea.  These  projects  include  the \nMillennium Road Project (running east-west across Mongolia) started in 2001, the Asian Highway \nProject, and a railway linking Choybalsan and Changchun. However, many of these projects will only \nrealize economic and financial benefits in the long term, and given the limited financial capability of \nthe governments in this region, all options need to be studied carefully and an implementable plan \nneeds to be developed. \n8.  ADB  has  helped  draft  a  transport  sector  strategy  for  Mongolia.9 ADB\u2019s  Second  Roads \nDevelopment Project10 from Nalayh to Choyr has now been completed, and ADB is in the process of \n                                                           \n6  Exports from the PRC are generally cheap to midpriced consumer products, and market competition has lowered prices \nsignificantly. Imports into the PRC are generally minerals, metals, and timber, and because of the rapid increase in \ndemand, the prices of most commodities have tripled or quadrupled in recent years. The PRC thus faces an ongoing \ntrade deficit. \n7  Despite being rich in natural and human resources and being more industrialized, economic development in the PRC\u2019s \nnortheastern region has been lagging behind that in the coastal region. \n8  ADB. 2000, Technical Assistance for Strategic Study on Development Options for Economic Cooperation Between the \nPeople's Republic of China and Mongolia In Eastern Parts of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, PRC, and Mongolia, \nManila.

Both segments are \nalong the north-south corridor that connects Ulaanbaatar to the Russian Federation and to the PRC, \nleading  to  Beijing  and  Tianjin.  A  prefeasibility  study  for  the  Western  Regional  Road  Corridor \nDevelopment Project12 examined alternative routes and concluded that the Yarant\u2013Hovd\u2013Olgiy\u2013\nTsagaannuur route would be the most suitable and technically viable.13  \n9.  Trade facilitation covers such issues as customs cooperation, cross-border infrastructure to \nhelp Mongolia access the sea, trade logistics development, and trade finance. Customs cooperation \nbetween Mongolia and the PRC has made significant progress. The PRC has offered Mongolian \ncustoms officials\u2019 regular training programs at its Shanghai customs training facility. There is also a \nprogram to streamline and exchange statistical data. More important, PRC and Mongolian customs \nreached agreement in October 2005 to pilot test joint processing. Two separate working groups \nwere set up in Mongolia and the PRC, and a joint working group meeting was held in April 2006 to \nplan the next steps. Mongolia also wishes the PRC to accelerate the process of accession to the \nTransport Internationaux Routiers (TIR) convention.  \n10.  Trade logistics development can not only enhance the efficiency of imports and exports, but \ncan  also  rationalize  the  use  of  production  factors  such  as  labor  and  raw  materials.  There  is \nsignificant room for improvement in efficiency in regional trade in the area, and the governments of \nboth Mongolia and the PRC have assigned high priority to this issue. Strategic planning and new \ninvestments are needed to unlock the trade potential of northeast Asia.  \n11.  The area of energy offers opportunities for regional cooperation. In Mongolia, a large coal \ndeposit is close to the existing railway line and less than 200 kilometers from the PRC border. \nPreliminary estimates indicate that this site could support a 3,600 megawatt power project. The \nState Grid Corporation, the PRC\u2019s power transmission and distribution company responsible for \nsupplying electricity to all but five southern provinces, and the Shenhua Group, the PRC\u2019s second \nlargest coal company, are collaborating to invest in coal mining, power generation, and power \ntransmission. The total investment is estimated at about $6.3 billion based on international tendering \nand the use of advanced power generation technologies. In approximately 5 years, 20 terawatt-\nhours per year of electricity would be exported to the PRC. \n12.  Mongolia\u2019s Ministry of Energy and Fuel has signed a memorandum of understanding with the \nPRC\u2019s State Grid Corporation regarding the joint development of power plants and the export of \nelectricity to the PRC. However, organizing a project finance package will be challenging given \nMongolia\u2019s weak institutional and financial capacity and poor infrastructure at potential project sites. \nCross-border projects have the added complication of needing to satisfy the laws, regulations, \nstandards, and guidelines of all participating countries. Project agreements will need to be balanced \nto ensure support from various stakeholders throughout the life of the project. In addition, the \ndevelopment and implementation of the project will be a major challenge, but if it is structured well \nand implemented successfully, it has the potential to yield considerable benefits to participating \ncountries and attract more investment in other cross-border projects. ADB\u2019s experience from the \nNam Theun 2 Hydroelectric Project14 in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic could be applied in \nthis situation. An enclave project could protect Mongolia\u2019s sovereign position while safeguarding its \nfair share of the project. ADB\u2019s contribution would be to design a robust project engineering and \nfinance  structure,  to  facilitate  the  process  of  obtaining  government  approval,  and  to  arrange \nfinancing. ADB will work closely with other multilateral development banks in further developing this \nproposal.  \n                                                           \n11 ADB. 2005.

A  RETA  on  dust  and  sandstorms15 funded  by  the  Global \nEnvironment Fund and the Japan Special Fund covering the PRC, Japan, Republic of Korea, and \nMongolia has been successfully implemented and a second phase is being formulated with funding \nfrom the Global Environment Fund and the PRC Poverty and Regional Cooperation Fund. A RETA \nto mitigate transboundary air pollution from coal-fired power plants is also being pursued in 2006.16 \nADB has also approved RETAs17 to promote transport, trade, and tourism among the Central Asian \ndeveloping member countries and to implement an intergovernmental agreement on facilitation of \ninternational  road  transport  taking  into  account  ongoing  negotiations  on  the  Transit  Traffic \nAgreement Framework among the PRC, Mongolia, and the Russian Federation.18 A study19 on \neconomic cooperation between East and South Asia is currently being undertaken by the ADB\u2019s \nOffice of Regional Economic Integration. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of enhanced regional cooperation will be to help ensure that the growth potential \nof Mongolia and the PRC is fully realized. The outcome of the RETA will be to put into operation a \nnumber of effective regional cooperation programs for which ADB can provide unique value added.20  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The RETA will: \n(i)  Examine all relevant issues, identify a road map, and formulate policy papers for \nimproving integration of the transport network in various economic corridors and \nfinding alternative routes to the sea for landlocked regions in Mongolia and the PRC, \nand consult other neighboring countries as appropriate. \n(ii)  Support  energy  cooperation  between  Mongolia  and  the  PRC  by  introducing  the \nenclave project concept and helping design a project finance package for a proposed \ncoal-fired power station for exporting electricity to the PRC. \n(iii)  Expedite a joint processing pilot project between the PRC\u2019s and Mongolia\u2019s customs \nauthorities by establishing policies, preparing procedures, and providing training. \n(iv)  Facilitate the PRC\u2019s accession to the TIR by introducing the experiences of other TIR \ncountries and providing training on customs-related operations.  \n(v)  Formulate  a  regional  strategy  for  trade  logistics  development  and  facilitate  the \ndevelopment of trade logistics plans for relevant geographic areas.  \n(vi)  Assist the authorities at border towns such as Zamyn-Uud and Erenhot to formulate \nand implement urban development plans aimed at developing trade logistics. \n(vii)    Provide capacity building to ensure effective participation in regional activity.  \n                                                           \n15 ADB. 2002.

The proposed regional transport plan and energy cooperation arrangement need to be firmly \nanchored  in  the  respective  countries\u2019  overall  infrastructure  development  plans.  Rational \napportionment of project costs in proportion to benefits is of critical importance to poor countries with \na low population density such as Mongolia. Consultants will be required to liaise closely with all \nrelevant  stakeholders  and  other  development  partners  during  preparation  of  the  regional \ntransportation master plan.   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The  total  cost  of  the  RETA  is  estimated  at  $800,000  equivalent,  including  $100,000 \nequivalent earmarked for preliminary preparatory work for the energy cooperation component. The \nRETA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's technical assistance funding program. Detailed \ncost estimates are in Appendix 2. The Governments of Mongolia and PRC have been informed that \nprovision of the RETA does not necessarily commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB would be the Executing Agency, and selected international and national consultants \nwould be engaged for specific tasks. \n19.  The RETA will engage a team of five international (10 person-months) and 5\u201310 national \nconsultants (20 person-months) in the fields of road and railway transportation, energy cooperation, \ncustoms  cooperation,  and  trade  logistics  development.  One  international  consultant  will  be \nappointed as the team leader. A separate budget will be available to engage additional international \nand national specialists for specific technical areas during implementation of the RETA as needed. \nThe consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 3. In addition to their technical inputs, the \nconsultants are expected to work proactively to achieve the two principal goals of (i) enhancing \nregional cooperation, and (ii) training and institutional capacity building. The RETA will be tendered \nto an international firm based on a simplified technical proposal using the quality- and cost-based \nselection method in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as \namended from time to time). Equipment will be procured by the consultants in accordance with \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (April 2006, as amended from time to time) and will be provided to \nparticipating developing member countries on completion of the RETA. Overseas training could be \norganized  for  key  government  officials  to  give  them  first-hand  experience  of  effective  regional \ncooperation initiatives. \n20.  The RETA is expected to begin in January 2007 and end in June 2008. The consultants will \nsubmit (i) inception reports 3 weeks after commencement of their services, (ii) interim progress \nreports every quarter during RETA implementation, (iii) draft final reports before the conclusion of \nthe contract, and (iv) final reports 2 weeks after incorporating comments from ADB. All reports must \nbe  submitted  in  the  English,  Mongolian  and Chinese  languages.  Workshops  will  be  organized \nperiodically to invite comments from international and national experts and to disseminate report \nfindings.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for the \nDevelopment of Regional Cooperation Programs for Mongolia and the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.
