INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Finance sector and private sector development is critical to the long-term prosperity of the \nPacific region. Pacific region developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) have developed, or are developing, their own finance sector and private sector \nstrategies as part of their national development plans and are initiating and implementing a range \nof finance sector and private sector-oriented reforms. \n \n2.  This technical assistance (TA) will focus on (i) identifying critical structural constraints to \nfinance sector development and thus private sector growth in Pacific DMCs; (ii) supporting \ndevelopment and processing of new projects that promote financial inclusion, investments, and \nprivate sector development; and (iii) facilitating effective engagement by ADB in these sectors.1 \nUnder ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach, Pacific region operations will enable value creation by supporting \nprivate sector growth and investment through legislative and financial reforms, private sector \noperations, and the promotion of financial inclusion.2 The TA is included in the regional operations \nbusiness plan, 2017\u20132019 for the Pacific and projects developed under this TA will be aligned \nwith national development plans of the Pacific DMCs as well as existing work in this area.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The underdeveloped finance sector has been a major constraint in the emergence of \nvibrant private sectors, impeding generation and flow of capital to productive sectors. This has \ncreated a perpetual reliance on public spending and external aid to support economic growth. \nSavings mobilization in the Pacific is low due to high fees, low deposit interest rates, and \ngeographic remoteness, while private sector investment is constrained by structural issues and \ncapacity limitations of financial institutions. Consequently, over half of the population in the Pacific \nremain outside the formal financial sector and a capital-constrained private sector is unable to \ngenerate sufficient employment and wealth creation. This is manifested in persistently low and \nfluctuating economic growth in the region. \n \n4.  The other significant barriers to private sector development identified in assessments \nconducted by ADB are (i) the high cost of providing public services; (ii) state intrusion in economic \nactivity through outdated regulations and widespread government ownership of key services, \nsuch as power generation; (iii) communal land ownership and unclear land tenure; (iv) high labor \ncosts resulting from thin labor markets, regulations, and the crowding out of businesses and \nindividual  investors  by  the  public  sector;  (v) barriers  to  women\u2019s  economic  empowerment; \n(vi) outdated business laws that do not suit the needs of modern commerce that take place over \nsubstantial distances; and (vii) the failure to subject businesses and state-owned enterprises to \nthe discipline of a competition framework.4 \n \n5.  ADB and its partners have supported the private sector and finance sector development \npredominantly through the Private Sector Development Initiative (PSDI), the Pacific Business \nInvestment Facility (BIF), the Samoa Agribusiness Support Project (SABS), and the Papua New \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 24 April 2017. \n2  ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2016. Regional Operations Business Plan: Pacific, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n4  P. Holden, M. Bale, and S. Holden. 2004. Swimming Against the Tide? An Assessment of the Private Sector in the \nPacific. Manila: ADB. ADB has documented the barriers to finance sector and private sector development in the \nregion in the private sector assessments completed for the Cook Islands (2015), Fiji (2014 update [unpublished], \n2013, 2006), the Marshall Islands (2003), Papua New Guinea (2015, 2008), Palau (2017, 2007), Samoa (2015, \n2008), Solomon Islands (2016, 2005), Timor-Leste (2015), Tonga (2012, 2008), and Vanuatu (2009). \n ", "2 \nGuinea Microfinance Expansion Project (MEP). PSDI focuses on helping Pacific region DMCs \nimprove  their  business  environments  by  removing  business  constraints,  fostering \nentrepreneurship,  promoting  business  formalization,  and  raising  productivity.  BIF  provides \nbusiness advisory services to established small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to raise \ncommercial finance for their growth plans. Since its establishment, BIF has supported the raising \nof $5.7 million for 12 companies. The SABS leverages commercial financing for agribusinesses \nin Samoa by providing collateral, supplemental capital, and advisory support. Since the project \ninception in 2014, eight agribusinesses received commercial funding with SABS support. The \nMEP promotes the microfinance sector in Papua New Guinea by delivering financial literacy \ntraining to individuals and small businesses, partial risk-sharing of microcredit portfolios, and \nsupporting institutional structures for sustainable development of the microfinance sector. \n \n6.  While PSDI, BIF, SABS, MEP, and other TA projects succeeded in achieving targeted \noutcomes, there is a strong necessity to broaden ADB\u2019s intervention in view of persistent \nunderdevelopment of the finance and private sectors in the Pacific. To create a sustained impact \nin the region, ADB needs to support DMC\u2019s to develop a cohesive set of finance and private sector \ndevelopment strategies to guide key initiatives, as well as serve as a road map for ADB\u2019s \nassistance program, based on a deeper understanding of sectoral constraints and lessons \nlearned from existing operations. Such strategies should guide ADB operations to support finance \nand private sector development in the Pacific region that (i) enhance financial inclusion and \nefficient financial intermediation, (ii) reduce business costs through regulatory and value chain \ninterventions, (iii) finance bankable public\u2013private partnership projects, and (iv) support Pacific \neconomies  in  developing  opportunities  for  niche  and  high-value  products  and  services. \nNotwithstanding the sector assessment and strategy development work, ADB has identified a \nnumber of areas of critical importance that need immediate support, including value chain \ninefficiencies in key SME industries, lack of scale of domestic financial institutions to operate \nviable lending operations, and shortage of finance or insurance for protection of private sector \nassets after catastrophic events. \n \n7.  This proposed TA will provide support in addressing these issues across the Pacific \nDepartment\u2019s sector operations in finance and private sector development. The TA will align with \ncurrent TA support managed by ADB\u2019s Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office for developing the \nfinance and private sectors, which are sector focus areas of that office. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: development-oriented policies that support \nproductive activities; job creation; entrepreneurship; creativity and innovation; and promoting the \nformalization and growth of micro enterprises and SMEs, including through access to financial \nservices.5 The TA will have the following outcome: project and program financing to support \nPacific region finance and private sector operations is increased.6 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  The TA will deliver the following outputs and associated activities over 2017\u20132019: \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2016. Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020. Pacific Approach Results Framework, 2016\u20132020 (Appendix 1). Manila. \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", " 3\n10.  Output  1.  Finance  sector  assessment  conducted  and  intervention  strategy \ndeveloped. The structure of the finance sectors in Pacific DMCs has gradually been evolving with \nthe  entry  of  new  regional  and  domestic  financial  institutions,  the  repositioning  of  national \ndevelopment banks, and the opening of new distribution channels for mobile and digital financial \ntechnologies. There is a growing need for ADB to undertake high impact demonstration projects \nin the Pacific finance sectors to stay relevant, especially in view of multiple challenges such as \nglobal de-risking that affects remittance flows,7 vulnerability of financial institutions to repeated \nnatural disasters, and lack of harmonization among the region\u2019s finance sector regulations that \nimpedes regional integration initiatives. \n \n11.  There is strong demand from Pacific DMCs for assistance in developing national finance \nsector strategies to promote financial inclusion and enhance long-term stability and resilience. \nThe small scale of the finance sectors in these DMCs reinforces a need to focus on regional \ncooperation and integration initiatives, making a regional approach to finance sector strategy \ndevelopment  appropriate.  Through  this  TA,  ADB  proposes  to  conduct  (i)  finance  sector \nassessments of the major Pacific island countries, and (ii) draft finance sector development \nstrategies that will guide the Pacific DMCs\u2019 key finance sector initiatives and will also serve as a \nroad map for ADB\u2019s finance sector assistance program. \n \n12.  Output 2. Finance sector and private sector operations projects developed. The TA \nwill support diagnostic work on critical finance sector issues confronting the Pacific. The three \nareas identified for immediate focus are (i) SME value chain finance, (ii) shared services platform \nfor financial institutions, and (iii) private sector disaster risk finance. There is flexibility under this \nTA to expand into other areas at a later point. \n \n13.  Small and medium-sized enterprise value chain finance. There is a persistent lack of \naccess to finance by SMEs as well as absence of critical industry value chain infrastructures such \nas large warehouses, export marketing and distribution hubs, and testing and quality control \ninstitutions which impede growth of key SME sectors that generate employment. Consequently, \nthere is high demand from Pacific DMCs to replicate and expand ADB\u2019s Samoa AgriBusiness \nSupport Project to their countries.8 The project supports agribusiness development throughout \nthe agriculture value chain in two complementary areas: suitable financing instruments, and \nbusiness support services. \n \n14.  Through this TA, ADB will conduct diagnostic work to identify the most appropriate \napproach for expanding the Samoa AgriBusiness Support Project to other Pacific DMCs, including \nby (i) looking at the use of cash collateral by financial institutions, the use of supplemental seed \ncapital by financial institutions to directly support SMEs and providing business advisory services \nto SMEs (ii) evaluating supply-side issues in SME finance by building the capacity of financial \ninstitutions in assessing and managing SME lending risks; and (iii) identifying key SME industry \nvalue chain constraints and designing projects to address those constraints. \n \n15.  Shared services for financial institutions. One of the key constraints to increasing \naccess to financial services by individuals and SMEs in the Pacific, especially in non-urban areas, \nis the difficulties faced by domestic financial institutions in scaling-up their operations. Developing \n                                                 \n7  Derisking by global banks covers a variety of phenomena, ranging from wholesale reduction in financial services, an \nunintended consequence of regulatory efforts or business decisions, to a risk-based implementation of international \nstandards (for example, correspondent bank relationship terminated owing to  weak controls for anti-money \nlaundering and combating the financing of terrorism in the respondent bank). \n8  ADB. 2014. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the \nIndependent State of Samoa for the Samoa AgriBusiness Support Project. Manila. \n ", "4 \nsuch capacity requires operating core transaction processing platforms and support operations \nwhich is costly for financial institutions. Being efficient and streamlined is even more important for \nsmaller financial institutions with thin profitability and staff strengths but they have little capital to \ninvest in creating such robust operational platform and back-office environments. A regional \nshared services project would look at helping small financial institutions to enable them to \noutsource some back- and middle-office processing functions to gain efficiency and cost savings. \nThe TA will support diagnostic work to advance this proposal. \n \n16.  The benefits gained by small financial institutions from a regional shared services platform \ninclude improved efficiency and effectiveness, increased capability to scale up operations, freed \nup capital, and improved risk management. \n \n17.  Disaster risk finance. Failure of many SMEs in the Pacific is attributable to losses \nsuffered from catastrophic events such as cyclones, tsunamis, and floods. Banks incur post \ndisaster loan losses from non-repayment by SMEs and are reluctant to make further lending at a \ntime when these SMEs need finance the most for recovery. Inability of banks to insure their \nportfolio against disaster risks is a contributing factor to their reluctance to extend finance to the \naffected SMEs. Portfolio risk insurance products remain undeveloped because of high costs, \nlimited availability of reinsurance, inadequate national disaster risk mitigation, small size of \ninsurable portfolio in individual countries, and a general lack of awareness.  \n \n18.  To address the issues of scale and risk diversification for the affordable protection of SME \nassets, the TA will support a diagnostic study to assess the feasibility of a regional risk-pooling \nplatform. This platform will pool disaster-related risks from insurance companies and commercial \nbanks across the region and transfer these pooled risks to international markets.  \n \n19.  Output 3: Generation and sharing of knowledge on finance and private sector \ndevelopment  supported.  The  knowledge  program  of  ADB\u2019s  Pacific  Department  seeks  to \n(i) deepen ADB\u2019s strategic understanding of the development challenges in the Pacific region, \n(ii) engage in policy dialogue, (iii) support ADB\u2019s engagement in the countries and in the region, \nand (iv) facilitate learning and knowledge sharing from experience in the Pacific and other regions. \nThe TA will support the generation and sharing of knowledge on finance and private sector \ndevelopment, consistent with the Pacific Department\u2019s knowledge program and in line with the \ndiagnostic and knowledge work undertaken under output 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \nThe participating governments will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, \noffice accommodation, office supplies, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  ADB will administer the TA; select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; procure goods; \norganize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons in workshops. The TA will be \nimplemented over 28 months, starting in July 2017. Should the need arise, ADB will seek \nadditional  financing  for  this  TA  from  cofinanciers  or  trust  funds.  ADB  will  obtain  a  written \nconfirmation of no objection before starting or financing any proposed activity in a selected DMC. \n \n ", " 5\nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements\nIndicative implementation period  July 2017\u2013October 2019 (28 months) \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual consultant  20 person-months of international and  $770,000 \nselection  25 person-months of national \nconsulting services \nProcurementa  To be procured by ADB\nShopping  Goods  $20,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  All equipment will be turned over to the executing agency upon TA completion. \narrangement upon TA completion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \na  Communications equipment, computers, printers, and other miscellaneous equipment to support TA implementation.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n22.
