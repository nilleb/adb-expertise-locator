The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is committed to increasing access to clean and \naffordable energy for people throughout the Asian and Pacific region, particularly the poor. \nADB's  Energy  Policy,1  approved  in  1995,  emphasizes  the  acceleration  of  the  widespread \napplication of renewable energy and energy  efficiency in its developing member countries \n(DMCs). This focus was strengthened through ADB's Energy Policy Review2 of 2000, which \nstates that, among other priorities, ADB will assist its DMCs in formulating and implementing \nviable  renewable  energy  projects\u2015preferably  with  private  sector  involvement\u2015to  provide \nelectricity in remote areas and improve the quality of life of the poor.  \n \n2.  The Energy for All initiative proposes to build on ADB\u2019s strengths and experience, and \ndevelop new approaches and methodologies for promoting access of the poor to reliable and \naffordable  modern  energy  services,  and  scale  up  to  levels  that  can  be  supported  by  the \noperational  departments  through  ADB  loans.  Concept  clearance  of  this  regional  technical \nassistance  (TA)  was  obtained  from  the  Vice  President,  Knowledge  Management  and \nSustainable Development, on 6 December 2006.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Energy services, in the broadest terms, refer to the benefits of an energy delivery system \nthat meet the needs of the users (e.g., lighting, cooking, heating, etc.). Access to efficient, \naffordable, and reliable modern energy services is recognized as essential for sustainable \ndevelopment. Yet almost half of the world's population do not have access to modern forms of \nenergy. Some 2.4 billion people are still dependent on traditional biomass fuels to meet their \ncooking and heating needs, with all  the health problems that the practice entails. Almost 70% of \nthe people from developing countries relying on biomass for cooking and heating are in Asia \nand the Pacific. Similarly, around 27% of the world's population (i.e., 1.6 billion people) still do \nnot have access to electricity. More than 99% of those without electricity live in developing \ncountries. Of that number, around 1 billion are in developing countries of Asia and the Pacific; \nand four out of five live in rural areas.  \n \n4.  Lack of electricity is not only a rural issue. More than 13% of the urban population still do \nnot have electricity in developing countries in Asia and this figure rises to almost 30% for South \nAsia.  Fast population growth and rapid urbanization over the next three decades will intensify \nthe challenge of providing access to electricity in cities of most developing countries, and urban \nelectrification  programs  will  need  to  accommodate  the  swelling  mass  of  the  urban  poor \nespecially those in slums.  \n \n5.  Even  though  no  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  refer  to  energy  explicitly, \nvarious studies have shown clear linkages between energy and all of the MDGs and have \nargued that much greater quality and quantity of energy services will be required to meet the \nMDGs. One common finding of the 10 task forces of the United Nations Millennium Project is \nthe urgent need to improve energy access so as to attain the MDGs. Without scaling up the \navailability  of  affordable  and  sustainable  energy  services,  not  only  will  the  MDGs  not  be \nachieved; 1.4 billion people globally will still have no access to electricity in 2030.    \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1995.

Manila.  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 13 December 2006.  \n ", "2   \n \n6.  The poor, especially women and children, are the most vulnerable section of society and \nare disproportionately affected by the adverse environmental effects of current energy patterns, \nhigh costs, and lack of access to clean, affordable energy services. Without access to modern \nenergy  services,  the  poor  will  (i)  suffer  from  respiratory  diseases,  (ii)  spend  many  hours \ncollecting fuelwood from forests and water from streams, and (iii) be deprived of opportunities to \nengage  in  income-generating  activities.  Particularly  worrisome  are  the  slow  pace  and  the \ndeterioration in quality and reliability of modern energy services available to the poor in some of \nthe developing countries where many still rely on traditional biomass fuels and the proportion of  \npeople without electricity continues to grow. It is urgent to take the quantum leap to replicate \nand scale up  successful programs to disseminate cleaner fuels, efficient stoves, and both grid \nand off-grid electrification to reduce adverse impacts on health and other damaging effects and \nto enhance the livelihood of people with the appropriate financing mechanism. The need to \nscale up arises from the limited impact and sustainability inherent in small-scale or one-off \nenergy projects if they are to reach the vast majority of people still lacking such services. The \ncurrent rate of rural electrification in many developing countries is very low. With the current rate \nof rural electrification in South Asia for instance, it would take at least 40 years to provide \nelectricity to the whole subregion. \n \n7.  The last decades have witnessed a wide range of technology interventions and energy \nsector  reform  initiatives  undertaken  by  developing  countries.  These  initiatives  range  from \nambitious  government-run  programs  to  small-scale  community-led  programs  with  active \nparticipation of the private sector and financial institutions, coupled with gender mainstreaming \napproaches  for  both  rural  and  urban  areas.  Those  initiatives  have  resulted  in  some \nimprovements in modern energy services to the poor and women, but were not expanded nor \nreplicated on a large scale. This TA aims to support demonstration projects that are scalable \nand replicable and/or modalities that are designed to lead to large-scale programs and will have \nthe  most  significant  long-term  impacts  on  increasing  households\u2019  access  to  energy. \nDemonstration of just the technology would not add any value to existing knowledge and \npractice.  The  focus  of  the  TA  will  be  on  the  approaches,  methodologies,  and  institutional \narrangements that are scalable and replicable so that large-scale programs can be implemented \nafterward with financial support from ADB or other sources.  \n \n8.  ADB has played an important role in supporting its DMCs to increase access to modern \nenergy  services.  For  example,  ADB  has  been  very  active  in  providing  financing  to  rural \nelectrification projects, both through grid extension and off-grid applications. However, ADB\u2019s \nemphasis has mainly been on grid extension. Off-grid applications and promotion of more \nefficient energy uses have been difficult for ADB to finance because such initiatives are often \nvery small and widely distributed throughout the country. ADB acknowledges the need to look at \nnew strategic approaches to help DMCs scale up successful interventions to increase access to \nmodern energy services for the poor. Such a scale-up is required so that such programs can be \nof a significant size for ADB to finance.  There is also the need for ADB to catalyze local \nfinancing institutions and the private sector to participate in the delivery of modern forms of \nenergy. The TA will specifically look at modalities and financial instruments and mechanisms \nneeded to catalyze and mobilize financial and private sector entities into this area. In addition, \nawareness needs to be raised and capacity built within DMCs so that the issue of access to \nenergy can be part of the dialogue and country programs of the ADB energy portfolio with the \nDMCs.  Implementation of this TA will help ADB build on its expertise and respond to requests \nfrom its DMCs to implement projects to access energy.  \n ", "  3\n9.  The Government of the Netherlands has expressed strong interest in supporting an \nEnergy for All initiative with the remaining funds of the Dutch Cooperation Fund for Promotion of \nRenewable Energy and Energy Efficiency. This initiative will also add to the commitment made \nby the Dutch Government to provide 10 million people with access to modern forms of energy \nby 2015. ADB will serve as a \u201cmultiplier\u201d and coordinate with the Government of the Netherlands \nto help achieve that target as well as assist ADB\u2019s participating DMCs achieve their MDGs.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA will improve the economic, environmental, and health conditions of the poor by \nincreasing their access to modern forms of energy. The outcomes will be (i) improved overall \nefficiency and effectiveness of energy access delivery mechanisms in participating DMCs, (ii) \nnew approaches and methodologies for providing energy access for the poor, and (iii) ADB\u2019s \nstrengthened institutional capacity and technical capability to develop and implement energy \naccess projects. The detailed design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n11.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  2\u20133  DMCs.  The  countries  will  be  selected  after \nconsidering where the available resources can best be utilized and the value these projects will \nadd to  existing knowledge and practice in the specific country  and to the whole region  and in \nclose consultation with the operations departments of ADB. Other ongoing programs in the host \ncountries will also be taken into account to avoid duplication of efforts.  DMCs participating in \nthis TA will have demonstrated a strong commitment to increase access of the poor to modern \nenergy services.  \n \n12.  Several key internal and external activities will need to be undertaken by the TA.  Much \nwork needs to be done in ADB itself. Currently, access-to-energy activities can be components \nof projects in the energy sector, through rural electrification or renewable energy projects; the \nurban sector, through projects such as urban slum improvement; agricultural and environment \nsectors, through rural  development projects; water sector, through  micro- and  small hydro \nprojects; and finance sector, through micro- and small-scale finance schemes. The approaches \nand methodologies for each of these sectors may differ. However, there are certain similarities \nand opportunities for learning through cross-fertilization of ideas. Currently, there is no system \nto share ADB\u2019s experiences from various sectors and regions or to review international best \npractices. To address this, a working group will be formed with representatives from the various \nsectors and regions to serve as the source of knowledge, experience, and expertise. The TA will \nalso serve as a resource to retain a full-time international consultant and issue-specific short-\nterm consultants, with demonstrated experience in access-to-energy projects to serve as a \nresource to operational departments on this issue. It will also be a resource to systematically \ndisseminate  information  through  presentations,  seminars,  and  workshops  in  ADB  to  build \ninternal capacity. \n \n13.  For the approaches and methodologies to be demonstrated, the working group4 will \nreview previous ADB experience, international best practices, and other relevant matters and \nset the criteria for shortlisting the countries in which the TA will operate and the approaches and \n                                                 \n4  With assistance from resource person(s) to be recruited under the TA. \n ", "4   \nmethodologies  to  be  demonstrated.  Issues  to  be  considered  when  selecting  countries, \nmodalities,  and  technologies  are  outlined  in  Appendix  2.  Once  the  TA  is  approved,  a \nconsultation mission will visit prospective host countries to assess their interest in participating \nin this initiative, evaluate the prospects of the modalities, and develop the actual mode of \nimplementation. The mission will also assess the capacity and interest of the private sector and \nfinancial institutions to undertake access-to-energy projects. The mission will discuss with other \naid agencies active in the energy sector in these countries the objectives and proposed modality \nunder the Energy for All initiative and explore potential local partners in implementing the \ninitiative. Based on these consultation missions, and in close collaboration and consultation with \nthe operations departments and the resident missions, the working group will finalize the list of \n2\u20133 DMCs for TA implementation and the approaches and methodologies to be demonstrated. \nA  detailed  design  for  their  implementation  will  then  be  prepared,  outlining  the  modalities, \nimplementation arrangements, beneficiaries of the project, etc. The TA will then implement \nthese  approaches  and/or  methodologies.  Potential  projects  and  countries  are  included  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,300,000 equivalent, to be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of the Netherlands and administered by ADB.5  The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Energy, Transport, and Water Division \nof  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  (RSID/RSDD)  will  be  primarily \nresponsible for all TA activities and will work together with the operations departments and \nresident missions. The existing Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency and Climate Change \n(REACH) Steering Committee6 will continue providing overall strategic guidance for the TA. The \nworking group mentioned in para. 12 will receive secretariat support from RSID. \n \n16.  Each  participating  DMC  will  designate  an  existing  agency  responsible  for  providing \nenergy to the rural or urban people as the implementing agency for the TA. To date, no specific \nDMC has been identified in whose territory any specific activity of the TA will be undertaken; any \nactivity funded by the TA will start in a particular DMC only after ADB has received a signed \nmemorandum of understanding from the government of each participating DMC, indicating its \nsupport for the TA and designating an appropriate implementing agency with whom ADB will \nwork. During implementation, the TA will explore whether there is merit in establishing a national \nsteering committee for each country as access\u2013to-energy issues are often overseen by more \nthan one government agency. Having such a steering committee will ensure that the various \ngovernment agencies have a sense of ownership of the demonstration project and see its value.  \n                                                 \n5  The governments of DMCs and project beneficiaries in the host countries that participate in the TA are expected to \nprovide in-kind and/or cash contributions, to facilitate implementation of TA activities in each DMC. However, such \ncontemplated in-kind government counterpart contributions have not been included in the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan in Appendix 3.  \n6  The REACH steering committee is chaired by the deputy director general of RSDD. Its members consist of the \ndirectors of infrastructure/energy divisions of the regional departments, Environment and Social Safeguard Division \nand Energy, Transport and Water Division of Regional and Sustainable Development Department, Infrastructure \nFinance  Division  1/Private  Sector  Operations  Department;  and  the  principal  director/Office  of  Cofinancing \nOperations.  ", "  5\nA key participant in such a steering committee would be each country\u2019s ministry of finance as \nthat is the ministry that coordinates ADB\u2019s country programming and it would be important to \nhave the officials of that ministry understand the importance of energy for all.  \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a 2-year period starting in February 2008 and ending in \nDecember 2009. It will require 264 person-months of consultant inputs (30 international and 234 \nnational).  The  international  consultants  are  expected  to  provide  guidance  and  transfer \nknowledge and experience to the national consultants, who will be responsible for implementing \nthe demonstration projects. As such, a greater proportion of the consultant inputs has been \nallocated to the national consultants. A national firm or NGO will be engaged using QBS and \nbiodata  proposal.7  In  addition,  $1.2  million  has  been  budgeted  for  demonstration  projects \nincluding costs of survey and design, equipment, installation, and credit enhancement facility.  \nThis amount exceeds the 30% normally allowed for ADB financing for a TA. However, this TA \nrepresents a continuation of TA 5972-REG: Promotion of Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency \nand Greenhouse Gas Abatement (PREGA),8 which was financed by the Government of the \nNetherlands, and included $1.5 million for demonstration projects.  However, the budgeted \nresources were never used under TA 5972.  The Government of the Netherlands, as financier of \nthis  TA,  would  like  a  similar  amount  that  was  budgeted  for  TA  5972  to  be  used  for  the \ndemonstration projects in this TA. Appendix 4 gives the outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants. Consultants will be selected in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time). Any equipment and materials9 to be \nfinanced by the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (April \n2006, as amended from time to time). On completion of the TA, the equipment will become the \nproperty of the government and participating local institutions and/or cooperatives. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n \n18.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,300,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of the Netherlands for the Energy for All Initiative.   \n \n \n \n                                                 \n7  An amplified terms of reference will be developed prior to recruitment.  \n8  ADB. 2001.

In  principle,  demonstration  projects  can  be  an  effective  means  of  engendering \nconfidence and thus scaling up the technologies, processes, or products that increase access to \nmodern  energy  services.  A  number  of  factors  govern  the  likely  success  of  particular \ndemonstration projects. There is then a further wide range of factors that need to be considered \nto  determine  whether  technically,  economically,  and  financially  successful  demonstration \nprojects would lead to market-based replications or a pipeline of development-assisted projects. \nSome issues to consider when selecting countries, modalities, and technologies are as follows.  \n \n(i)  Innovativeness  of  the  approach  in  particular  markets/applications.  The \napproach or modality that will be demonstrated should either be innovative in the \nparticular  target  market  sector  or  have  benefits  that  are  not \nmeasured/quantified/credible/widely  known.  In  other  words,  the  innovation  is \nmeant to demonstrate.  \n \n(ii)  Available market. Before a project can be successfully replicated, a potential \nmarket must exist\u2015one that will use the technology, process, or product once it \nis successfully demonstrated.  \n \n(iii)  Replicability. Demonstration projects should provide opportunities for relatively \nsimple  replications.  Projects  that  will  have  applications  only  in  specialized \nenvironments  or  in  very  limited  circumstances  are  unlikely  to  have  desired \nimpacts on the scaling-up efforts. In countries with an existing proactive and \nstrong private sector, financial institutions, and nongovernment organizations, \nreplication  efforts  to  provide  access  to  modern  energy  services  for  more \nhouseholds are likely to be scaled up.    \n \n(iv)  Technical  viability.  To  be  effective,  the  technology  must  be  robust. \nTechnologies that are available for a known price, sold by established firms and \norganizations  with  existing  track  records  in  the  same  or  similar  products  or \nmarkets,  can  be  made  available  through  existing  distribution  channels  and \ntechnology providers that have in-house technical support for installation, after-\nsales service ,and so on to help ease the scaling-up efforts. Such providers \nshould be able to easily solve minimal technical problems if any occur during the \noperation. \n \n(v)  Economic  viability.  Demonstration  projects  must  be  inherently  economic. \nProject economics, including the cost savings potential of the project, and the \nmagnitude  of  the  expected  benefits  associated  with  its  replication  must  be \nassessed. Mobilizing existing resources through the Global Environment Facility, \nthe  Clean  Development  Mechanism,  and  other  local/national/international \ncofunding sources, and some contribution from the users themselves would help \ncreate a sense of ownership and make the pro-poor projects viable.   \n \n(vi)  Effective supply chain. To be effective, the demonstration project needs to be \nsupported by a supply chain that has a proven track record of delivering the \nrequisite goods and services as and when required. All elements of the supply \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nchain would also need the capacity to respond adequately to the needs of new \nprojects during scaling up. \n \n(vii)  Monitoring and evaluation. The project needs to be such that at its completion, \nit should be possible to determine whether the project actually worked and led to \nbeneficial,  let  alone  financial  or  economic,  results.    To  do  this,  a  point  of \nreference must be established against which outcomes can be compared. In \naddition  to  detailed  monitoring,  evaluation  of  the  wider  aspects  of  the \ndemonstration project is required.   \n \n(viii)  Plan for scaling up. Right at the beginning, there should be a clear plan  on how \nthe projects will be scaled up once the demonstration project is successful. This \nis to ensure that the successful project/idea will move to the desired scale as the \noutcome of the demonstration project. Any viable demonstration project thus \nneeds to be complemented by a marketing strategy to disseminate the project\u2019s \nbenefits so that scaling up can take place.    \n \n2.  Potential Projects. The potential projects and countries for Energy for All include but \nare not limited to (i) promotion of community-managed decentralized energy systems (micro-\nhydro, solar, biomass) in Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Pakistan, \nand the Philippines (where feasible, private entrepreneurs, instead of the community, can also \noperate the energy system); and (ii) new financing mechanisms using credit enhancement, \npromoting local financing for individual household-level technologies (e.g., solar home systems, \nsolar powered white-light-emitting diode lamps) through local financial institutions in Nepal. \nThese approaches and methodologies will focus on (i) private sector participation, (ii) new and \ninnovative financing mechanisms, and (iii) use of community-based models (e.g., cooperatives, \netc.) to improve access to energy. The demonstration projects and modalities will be based on \nprefeasibility and feasibility studies undertaken under TA 5972-REG: Promotion of Renewable \nEnergy, Energy Efficiency and Greenhouse Gas Abatement (PREGA)10, as well as other best \npractices in the region, in consultation with the host developing member countries.   \n \n3.  PREGA was financed by the Dutch Cooperation Fund for Promotion of Renewable \nEnergy and Energy Efficiency, funded by the Government of the Netherlands. A total of 18 \nDMCs  (Azerbaijan,  Bangladesh,  Cambodia,  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  India,  Indonesia, \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, Samoa, Sri \nLanka, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Viet Nam) participated in PREGA, which was completed on \n31 December 2006. \n \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2000.
