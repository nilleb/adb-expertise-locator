INTRODUCTION \n1.  The recognition that climate change poses serious threats to development and poverty \nreduction efforts is reflected in the country partnership strategies of many Asian Development \nBank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs). The four pilot countries in the proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA)\u2014India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand\u2014have emphasized \nthe need for stronger integration of climate change into the development process and have \nincluded climate change adaptation programs, projects, and TA in their respective country \noperations business plans. Lack of information on the magnitude and timing of likely climate \nchange impacts has impeded the development of effective climate risk management strategies. \nThe TA aims to support the efforts of these countries to better manage climate change risks by \n(i) providing scientifically sound and decision-oriented climate data and projections; and (ii) \nenhancing their technical capacity to generate, interpret, and apply climate information. This will \nenable them to undertake more robust climate risk screening, impact and vulnerability analysis, \nand  assessment  of  potential  adaptation  options.  By  enabling  more  robust  climate  risk \nassessment and management, the TA contributes to safeguarding and sustaining development \noutcomes in Asia and the Pacific under a changing climate. The TA design and monitoring \nframework is Appendix 1.1  \n \n2.  Regional  fact-finding  identified  a  consensus  around  the  need  for  detailed  regional \nclimate projections, available as public goods, to support climate change adaptation and risk \nmanagement.  The  Environment  and  Safeguards  Division  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment  Department  organized  extensive  consultations  with  representatives  from  the \nworld\u2019s leading climate science institutes, regional research centers encompassing many of the \npilot country implementing agencies, and development partners to scope a regional climate \nprojections and data facility and associated approach to developing and delivering the facility.   \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The absence of scientifically credible climate change information, and of clear guidelines \nfor  its  interpretation  and  use,  have  been  identified  as  strong  impediments  to  the  robust \nassessment of risks related to climate change and to the design and implementation of effective \nadaptation and development projects within Asia and the Pacific. Within the region, which \ncontains the highest number of poor people at risk from climate change globally, more readily \navailable  and  scientifically  sound  climate  information  is  central  to  improving  the  design  of \npoverty reduction programs in the face of climate change. Improved capacities for developing, \naccessing,  interpreting,  and  applying  climate  change  projections  to  support  climate  risk \nassessments  and  adaptation  planning  are  urgently  needed.  Such  climate  information  and \nsupporting products and services are regional public goods and are therefore most effectively \ndeveloped  through  regionally  coordinated  activities.  Regional  climate  data  and  scenarios \nconsortia of the type proposed here have been developed for other regions, notably the United \nStates and Europe, but not yet for Asia and the Pacific. However, the need for such data and \nscenario  products  within  the  region,  accompanied  by  sound  user  guidance  and  technical \nsupport, is arguably most compelling because of the high exposure and high vulnerability of \nAsian and Pacific societies to climate-related risks. \n \n4.  To support the integration of climate change considerations into development policies \nand programs in its DMCs, ADB has been investing in developing climate data and projections \nas inputs to climate risk assessments and adaptation planning, often on a project-by-project \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 January 2013.  \n ", "2  \nbasis. Despite the progress in raising public awareness and quantifying the potential impacts of \nclimate change facilitated by these early efforts, there are clearly limitations to the project-based \napproach.  First,  efforts  are  often  constrained  by  the  availability  of  time  and  resources  as \nprojects  operate  within  specific  time  frames  and  budget  allocations.  Second,  given  the \nuncertainties  associated  with  climate  projections  and  potential  for  misinterpretation  and \ninappropriate use, the lack of communication between users and developers, as well as the \nabsence of practical guidance, undermined the wider and more appropriate use of climate data \nand projections. Third, climate data and projections and associated data sources and underlying \nmethodology developed under specific projects are usually not fully documented or archived. \nThis makes it difficult for other projects with similar climate information requirements to tap into \nthe data and projections from earlier projects. As a result, valuable and limited resources would \nagain have to be allocated to develop comparable climate projections for later projects. \n   \n5.  Through the establishment of a regional consortium, the proposed TA is designed to \naddress these issues and to lay a solid foundation for developing regional public goods and \nservices in the form of scientifically robust and decision-oriented climate data and projections in \na cost-effective fashion. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The primary impact of the TA will be an improved planning process for climate-resilient \ndevelopment in selected DMCs under a changing climate. 2 The overall outcome of the TA will \nbe an improved climate-resilient program and project design in selected DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n7.  The TA will (i) develop a regional climate projections consortium for the provision of \nrobust climate information and supporting services, (ii) develop and deliver decision-oriented \nclimate data and projections, and (iii) enhance technical capacity of the implementing agencies \nin the four pilot countries. This is in line with ADB\u2019s catalytic role in (i) leveraging the climate \nscience expertise within and beyond Asia and the Pacific, (ii) fostering regional ownership of \nclimate  information  and  services,  and  (iii)  strengthening  in-country  technical  capacity.  The \nselection of pilot countries is made on the basis that in these countries (i) there is a clear need \nfor improved access to, and technical capacity to develop and use climate data and projections \nto support climate risk assessments and management; (ii) the required levels of expertise and \ninfrastructure exist to enable full benefit from the TA support and to ensure the sustainability of \nthe consortium beyond the lifetime of the TA; and (iii) there have not been similar initiatives.3  \n \n8.  Given the large number of ongoing and planned initiatives in Asia and the Pacific, efforts \nwill be made to ensure synergies are explored and duplication of work avoided. 4 In particular, \n                                                 \n2  The impact of the TA will not be limited to the participating pilot countries but will extend to other DMCs that will be \nable to access and utilize the climate data and projections facility.  \n3  The TA proponent has been systematically reviewing ongoing and planned initiatives in Asia and the Pacific to \nidentify synergies, learn from good practices, and avoid duplication of effort. Through extensive discussions and \nconsultations with donor agencies and their implementing agencies and centers, the TA team will seek to leverage \nresources and expertise from these initiatives with a view to maximizing the regional benefit from the TA.     \n4  These include, among others, ADB-supported TA projects, other multilateral and bilateral supported initiatives such \nas those included in the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience being developed and implemented in selected DMCs \nand the Pacific region.   \n ", "  3\nthe TA will utilize results, expertise, and experience from ongoing initiatives for the design and \ndelivery of project outputs. At the same time, it will add value to these initiatives through the \nestablishment of regional mechanisms for technical support and learning.  \n \n9.  A wide range of activities are planned to deliver the three outputs, including consultation \nand assessment of needs for climate information and capacity strengthening, targeted climate \nmodeling and model performance evaluation, scenario analyses, provision of scenario data \nproducts and user services, thematic training, communications, and outreach. \n \n10.  Output 1: A regional climate projections consortium for Asia and the Pacific. To \ncost-effectively and sustainably utilize the technical expertise in climate modeling and analysis \nfound in leading institutions within and beyond Asia and the Pacific, the consortium presents a \nregional mechanism for developing and applying climate information in support of climate risk \nassessments and management. In contrast to the current practice of engaging climate scientists \nand analysts on an ad-hoc and project-focused basis, the consortium approach will enable \nwider participation and contribution from centers of excellence with relevant expertise, and will \nensure  that  the  provision  of  technical  advice  and  support  is  institutionalized  and,  hence, \nsustained beyond the lifetime of the TA.5 In addition, the consortium approach will foster a \ngreater sense of ownership by regional centers, which in turn will help ensure the long-term \nsustainability of the technical services provided by consortium partners. The consortium will \ncomprise centers of excellence with recognized expertise in (i) climate science, (ii) climate risk \nand vulnerability research, (iii) adaptation planning and practice, and (iv) knowledge sharing and \nclimate science communications. Partners will be primarily from Asia and the Pacific, but will \nalso include international centers of excellence. \n \n11.  Output  2:  Climate  information  products  and  services  for  pilot  countries,  and \nrelated knowledge products for all developing member countries. These will include the \nfollowing: \n(i)  Scientifically sound, well documented, decision-oriented climate data and \nprojections for target countries. Working with consortium partners and based \non detailed country-level user needs analysis, implementing agencies in the four \npilot countries will lead the design, development, and dissemination of country-\nspecific climate information products oriented to user needs.6 These will include \ninformation  products  to  support  climate-resilient  development  planning  and \nclimate risk assessment and management in core economic sectors.   \n(ii)  A regional climate data and projections facility. The facility will be the online \npresence of the consortium and a key output of its activities. The facility will \nserve a number of specific functions, including (a) providing general information \non the TA; (b) facilitating online discussions (ongoing, general, and moderated \nthematic)  around  the  development  and  application  of  climate  information \nproducts; (c) providing access to climate data and scenario products and other \nassociated  knowledge  products  developed  under  the  TA;  (d)  facilitating  the \n                                                 \n5  Japan Meteorological Research Institute, Korean Meteorological Administration, Commonwealth Scientific and \nIndustrial Research Organisation of Australia, United States National Center for Atmospheric Research, and UK \nMet Office contributed to discussions on the TA concept and expressed strong interest in participating. \n6  Examples of such products include general climate change features such as seasonal changes in core climate \nparameters, changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as droughts and floods, and changes \nin climatic features pertinent to core economic activities and sectors such as changes in reliable rainfall amounts \n(for irrigation management). Changes in climate parameters and related features would be accompanied by \ncharacterization of uncertainties, e.g., expressed in probabilities and/or likelihoods.   \n ", "4  \nprovision of expert advice and services; and (e) providing links to other data, \nscenarios, and knowledge products developed outside the TA. \n(iii)  A \u201ctechnical template\u201d for developing climate information products that \nare country specific and user needs oriented for other developing member \ncountries.  The  technical  processes  involved  in  developing  and  delivering \nclimate information products in the four pilot countries (e.g., coordination and \ncollaboration mechanisms) will be documented, analyzed, and synthesized into \na more generic technical template for potential replication in other DMCs. The \nelaboration and dissemination of the template will be informed and supported by \ninputs  from  nonpilot  country  DMCs  through  consultations  and  regional \nknowledge-sharing events.      \n \n12.  Output  3:  Enhanced  technical  capacity  for  developing  and  applying  climate \ninformation products and services in developing member countries. This will have two \ncomponents:  \n (i)  Enhanced technical capacity of implementing agencies in pilot countries \nthrough learning by doing. Through a combination of working in partnership \nwith  international  experts  and  learning  by  doing,  technical  experts  in  pilot \ncountries will have the opportunity to enhance their capabilities in a range of \nthematic  areas  associated  with  the  design,  development,  dissemination, \ncommunication, and application of climate data and projections.   \n(ii)  Strengthened technical capacity in pilot countries through development \nand delivery of a series of training courses (modules). Knowledge products \non the development and application of climate data and scenarios for climate \nrisk assessment and adaptation planning, drawn from activities and case studies \nin pilot countries, will be developed and delivered to stakeholders in both pilot \nand nonpilot countries via the data and projections facility as well as \"webinar\" \nand targeted in-person training sessions.    \n \n13.  The TA is built on the premise that improved access to scientifically sound climate data \nand  projections  will  enable  more  robust  climate  risk  assessment,  risk  management,  and \nadaptation decision making. This will in turn improve the effectiveness of poverty reduction and \ndevelopment assistance through ensuring the attainment and sustainability of development \ngoals in a changing climate. Since the consortium and the facility proposed under the TA will be \nthe first of their kind in Asia and the Pacific, a publication will be developed to synthesize good \npractices and lessons learned during the TA for wide dissemination. In addition, a section of the \ninternet platform to be developed under the TA will be devoted to sharing and disseminating \nexperiences and good practices among users of the platform as an ongoing activity. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,964,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA, with the Environment and Safeguards \nDivision of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department as the focal point. The \nfollowing national climate and meteorology institutions in the TA target countries will be the \nimplementing agencies: the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in India, the Bureau of \n ", "  5\nMeteorology,  Climatology  and  Geophysics  in  Indonesia,  the  Philippine  Atmospheric \nGeophysical  and  Astronomical  Services  Administration  in  the  Philippines,  and  the  Thai \nMeteorological Department in Thailand. Implementing agencies will play key roles in developing \nand  delivering  climate  data  and  projections  and  technical  capacity  strengthening  in  their \nrespective countries, through learning by doing, and close collaboration between implementing \nagency technical staff and experts to be recruited under the TA. Specifically, these agencies will, \nundertake  data  processing  and  analyses  and  provide  support  for  in-country  technical \ncoordination, training, and outreach of the TA. Implementing agencies will provide substantial in-\nkind contributions, including the time of technical personnel, towards implementation of the TA.      \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years, from April 2013 to March 2015. Initially ADB \nwill take the lead in establishing the consortium, defining the scope of and the delivery platform \nfor the data facility. Once the consortium is fully functional and the key components of the facility \nare identified, ADB will engage all partners of the consortium to discuss the long-term business \nmodel  and  will  oversee  a  transition  to  an  operational  mode  conducive  to  self-sustaining \ncollaborations among partners. For the initial phase, the ADB officer in charge of this TA will \nsupervise and coordinate the activities. Implementation of the substantive TA activities will \nrequire inputs from a team of six international consultants (57 person-months) and 13 national \nconsultants (96 person-months), to be engaged as individuals and to be headed by a team \nleader  who  will  eventually  be  responsible  for  overall  coordination  of  TA  implementation. \nIndividual consultants (as opposed to a firm) will be selected because the TA requires a wide \nrange of expertise as well as flexibility in their engagement with pilot countries and partners of \nthe consortium. Experience from similar initiatives suggests that selecting individual consultants \nincreases the likelihood that the diverse expertise required for TA activities will be secured, and \nwill provide the flexibility needed to ensure efficient implementation. Terms of reference for \nconsultants are provided in Appendix 3. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance \nwith  the  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nProcurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time). All disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).7 \nNo activities will be undertaken in a participating country until the requisite no-objection letters \nhave been obtained. \n \n17.   ADB,  as  the  executing  agency,  will  coordinate  periodic  reviews,  both  internal  and \nexternal,  to  assess  progress, identify  areas for  improvement  in  implementation,  and  make \nrequired  corrective  changes.  These  reviews  will  assess  not  only  the  outputs  but  also  the \nprocess of engaging the consortium partners and all stakeholders, particularly those directly \ninvolved in providing and applying climate data and projections to be developed under the TA \nand beyond.  \n \nIV.  THE RANKING VICE-PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n18.  The  Ranking  Vice-President,  acting  in  the  absence  of  the  President,  under  the \nprovisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, recommends that the Board \napprove ADB administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,964,000 to \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for a Regional Climate \nProjections Consortium and Data Facility in Asia and the Pacific. \n                                                 \n7 Equipment procured under the TA will be donated to the implementing agencies upon TA completion. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions and \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved planning  By 2018, national and  National development  Improved access to \nprocess for climate  sectoral development plans  plans and strategy  climate information \nresilient development in  are informed by robust  papers, donor agency  products and services  \nselected DMCs under  a  climate risk assessment  reports on development  enhance technical \nchanging climate   and management in all pilot  programs     capacity in DMCs to \ncountries and at least 10  support climate-resilient \nother DMCs  development planning \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved climate-resilient  By March 2015, in pilot  CPSs, ADB project  Climate information \nprogram and project  countries:  documents, TA reports,  products and services \ndesign in selected DMCs      bilateral donor project  and increased technical \n  Investment  reports   capacity made available \nprograms/projects in the  under the TA are \nCPS in climate sensitive  effectively used to \nsectors include a climate  support climate-resilient \nchange adaptation  development program \ncomponent  and project design \n    \nThe design of 50% of ADB-  \nsupported projects in \nclimate sensitive sectors is \nsupported by climate risk \nassessments using climate \ninformation and services \nunder the TA \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
