The political stability and economic liberalization that have now taken firm root \nin  Cambodia  create  the  conditions  for  maintaining  macroeconomic  stability  and  attracting \ninvestment, and these are crucial for sustainable development and poverty alleviation. Despite \nthese successes, we need to do more to ensure that this economic growth benefits all of our \npeople, especially the poor and disadvantaged. \n \nAs in most fast-developing countries, economic growth has not benefited people and regions \nequally. While national development continues to yield national benefits, local development has \nbeen uneven, and regional and personal inequalities persist. In Cambodia, it is also difficult for \nus to directly deliver local development and the required range of public services across the \ncountry  from  the  Capital.  Therefore,  we  must  fundamentally  change  our  approaches  in \ndelivering local development and public services. \n \nOne of our key approaches in tackling local development, inequality and poverty is the policy of \nDemocratic  Development  set  out  in  the  Strategic  Framework  for  Decentralization  and \nDeconcentration Reforms adopted by the RGC in June 2005. We have since enacted the Organic \nLaw and established democratically-elected sub-national councils.  \n \nThe Royal Government has chosen this path in order to achieve broad-based and sustainable \ndevelopment and to strengthen vital local economic foundations. The RGC wants every citizen \nto participate in local development and improve the management and delivery of quality public \nservices to meet locally-established priority needs and to ultimately reduce poverty. We look to \nthe sub-national councils and their unified administrations to deliver on these goals. To this end \nwe will gradually assign appropriate functions to the councils, together with the necessary \nfinancial, human and other resources to do the job; all the while helping them to develop their \ncapacity to deliver quality services to their citizens.  \n \nAt the same time, the Royal Government has embarked on a number of other major governance \nreforms, including the Public Financial Management Reforms and the Public Administration \nReforms, and we must ensure that all of these reforms are implemented in a harmonized and \ncoordinated fashion so that we ensure maximum value-added benefit for all citizens. I am very \nglad to see mechanisms in place in this Programme to ensure that outcome.  \n \n  i ", " \nThe National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development (NCDD) was established to \nassist the Royal Government to implement the terms of the Organic Law and to formulate, \noversee and coordinate implementation of a national D&D programme. The NCDD is now fully \noperational, and is working with all levels of government, including central and line ministries \nand  councils  at  sub-national  administration  levels  to  achieve  the  common  objective  of \nestablishing, promoting and sustaining democratic development. \n \nThis NP-SNDD has been formulated with full participation from central ministries, agencies and \nsub-national  administrations,  development  partners,  civil  society  organizations  and  other \nconcerned stakeholders, and approved by the Minister\u2019s Council at its full meeting on 28th May \n2010. The Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Ministry of Planning, the SSCS, the Ministry \nof Interior and other ministries and agencies, as NCDD member, must take the lead across a \nrange of strategic, policy and legal issues relating to finance, administration, human resources \nand  planning.  They  must  work  closely  together  in  order  to  ensure  effective  and  efficient \nimplementation. The sector ministries must carefully examine their roles, responsibilities and \nfunctions  in  terms  of  what  is  currently  in  existence;  and  in  terms  of  how  these  roles, \nresponsibilities and functions will change under the D&D reforms. The Royal Government \nexpects each ministry to familiarize itself with the D&D policy and the Organic Law, and to take \nresponsibility for implementing the policy and the law. The NP-SNDD is the vehicle which will \nprovide technical and financial assistance to the implementation of the above policy and law. \n \nSub-national administrations must familiarize themselves with the D&D policy and the Organic \nLaw. They too must consider their new roles and responsibilities in order to implement the NP-\nSNDD. They must consult with, and involve local stakeholders, including the private sector and \ncivil society, in developing their visions and their strategic plans. At the same time, they must \nprepare themselves to take on the responsibilities and functions envisaged, and to carry out these \nfunctions and deliver these services effectively and efficiently. The manner in which they do this \nwill greatly affect the achievement of democratic development and the extent to which they can \ndeliver quality services in response to local needs and demands across the country. Again, \nthrough the NP-SNDD, the Royal Government will provide support, advice and assistance to the \nSNAs as they plan and implement this work.  \n \nFrom our own experience as well as lessons learned in other countries, we know that the NP-\nSNDD will be a very complex programme  of change  and will be difficult to implement. \nTherefore,  we  must  have  long  term  joint  political  commitments  and  regularly  review  its \nimplementation  progress,  and  articulate  revised  ongoing  programmes  that  address  these \nchallenges and are based on lessons learned from the ongoing implementation experience. \n \nThe D&D reforms provide us an opportunity to establish a new sub-national government system \nthat embodies the main tenets of good governance, including accountability, adherence to the \nrule of law, transparency, participation, equity, inclusiveness, responsiveness, efficiency and \neffectiveness. \n \nThis NP-SNDD is the Royal Government\u2019s priority. I, therefore, expect each ministry to take the \nlead in its area of responsibility, and to contribute constructively to the government\u2019s aim of \nbringing service delivery closer to the people who need and receive those services; and I expect \neach tier of sub-national administrations to engage with the people in the design and delivery of \nall government programmes under their jurisdiction successfully. \n \nThe NP-SNDD provides us with great opportunities to achieve more equitable growth; to \npromote  and  achieve  sustainable  local  development,  and  to  contribute  directly  to  poverty \n  ii ", " \nreduction over the next decade. These are noble and worthwhile aspirations with the potential to \nimprove the lives of all of our citizens. \n \nOn behalf of the RGC, I would like to deeply thank the development partners who have been \nparticipating  with  the  RGC  in  providing  both  financial  and  technical  assistance  for  the \nimplementation of this NP.  Furthermore, I would like to ask the Royal Government\u2019s ministries, \nagencies,  sub-national  administrations,  development  partners  and  all  other  stakeholders  to \nprovide your wholehearted support and jointly implement the NP-SNDD for greatest success as \nexpected. \n \n \nPhnom Penh, 22nd June 2010 \n  \n \n \nSamdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo HUN SEN  \n  iii ", " \nTable of Contents \n \nMessage of Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo HUN SEN Prime Minister of the Kingdom \nof Cambodia ................................................................................................................................................ i \nTable of Contents ...................................................................................................................................... iv \nList of Acronyms ...................................................................................................................................... vii \nPreface ........................................................................................................................................................ ix \n \nCHAPTER 1 \nINTRODUCTION \n \n1.1.

(NP-SNDD) is the RGC\u2019s \nagenda for the next 10 years in the comprehensive and in-depth governance reform process of \nthe sub-national administrations, which will also impact on other national institutions.  The \nformulation of NP-SNDD reflects and confirms the RGC\u2019s political commitment to the vision, \npolicies  and  strategies  outlined  in  the  D&D  Strategic  Framework  and  the  government\u2019s \ncommitment to implementing the Organic Laws on Capital, Province, Municipality, District and \nCommune/Sangkat administrations. \n \nThe  NP-SNDD  has  been  formulated  while  the  RGC  is  strengthening  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of institutions at all levels towards achieving good governance, development and \npoverty reduction.  To achieve these goals, great efforts by all national and sub-national levels \nare required, as well as effective cooperation between them.  In this reform process, there is a \nneed for equal opportunity for all citizens to participate in local development and to demand \nbetter and more comprehensive public services to meet citizen\u2019s needs, leading to poverty \nreduction and focusing on the most vulnerable groups, particularly the indigenous peoples, \nwomen and children. \n \nIn this respect, the RGC\u2019s goals for sub-national democratic development are to: \n\u2022  Create a culture of local participatory democracy, accountable to the citizens; \n\u2022  Improve public services and infrastructures; \n\u2022  Bring about social and economic development; \n\u2022  Contribute to poverty reduction. \n \nProgramme Areas \n \nThis document describes the goals, objectives and scope of the NP-SNDD implementation \nframework by platform (or phase) and sets out the activities planned under each programme area \ndesigned to achieve sub-national democratic development.   \n \nIt outlines five programme areas as following: \n \n1.  Sub-national Institutional Development \n \nThe directly and indirectly elected councils at all sub-national administrative levels are the \nprimary means for program implementation.  The establishments of those councils are not only \nfor dialogue / forum purposes, and the D&D Framework and the Organic Laws expect those \ncouncils to achieve concrete results in improving the quality of local people\u2019s lives, starting with \nthe poorest of the poor and the vulnerable groups.  The SNDD principles require that the elected \ncouncils at all sub-national levels represent their own communities, and are responsive and \naccountable to their local communities for their performance in carrying out their functions. To \nachieve this mission, sub-national councils shall receive the necessary authority and resources, \nincluding human, financial and physical resources, together with legal competency in order to \nmake decisions serving the local communities\u2019 interests. \n \n\u2022  Therefore, the creation of sub-national councils significantly modify the lines of \naccountability  for  the  existing  sub-national  administrations.    The  Organic  Laws \nintended for sub-national councils to grow as a strong local foundation and to have \nautonomy, but no sovereignty. \n  ix ", " \nResponding to these changed requirements, sub-national councils shall have clear administrative \nstructures, systems, and procedures in order to become strong local governance institutions, \ncontributing towards poverty reduction and sustainable development across the country. \n \n2.   The Development of Strong Human Resource Management Systems \n \nThe elected sub-national councils are composed of members from different political parties, and \nthose council members would not have adequate skills and professions to perform all tasks. \nFurthermore, when more functions and resources are transferred to sub-national levels, the \nelected council members could not undertake all tasks and manage all resources by themselves. \nTherefore, the councils shall have qualified, competent and experienced staff to undertake \nfunctions on behalf of the councils and to implement the council\u2019s decisions.  The D&D \nStrategic Framework and Organic Laws require that the councils have their own permanent \npersonnel to fulfill the council\u2019s tasks, who in turn shall be accountability to the respective \ncouncil.  The Organic Law calls for the establishment of a personnel framework at sub-national \nadministrations through the development of separate statute for civil servants at sub-national \nlevel under the Law on Civil Servant\u2019 Statute of the Kingdom of Cambodia.  The development \nof this personnel framework is a process linked with the transfer of functions and resources.  \nThis process of transferring personnel to the sub-national councils is complex and must be \nimplemented with care. \n \nThe  NP-SNDD  document  has  called  for  steps,  phases  and  key  activities  in  transferring \npersonnel, adequately developing human resource management and development systems which \nensure that there is no increase in the overall number of the staff in the country that could impact \non the government\u2019s payroll costs. \n \n3.  The Transfer of Functions and Resources   \n \nThe  provision  of  public  services,  materials/means  and  basic  infrastructures  is  a  crucial \ncomponent  in  the  sub-national  democratic  development.    Councils  of  all  sub-national \nadministrative levels shall assigned functions, together with adequate resources, in order for \nthem to be able to provide public services, necessary materials and basic infrastructures to their \nlocal communities.  The transfer of functions and resources shall carried out in a transparent, \ncoordinated and consultative manner according to plans, phases and appropriate rationales; and \nwith minimum disruption of RGC and DP\u2019s on-going operations. \n \nEffective  provision  of  the  public  services  is  closely  linked  with  the  transfer  of  authority, \nbringing the handling of key basic public services closer to the people.  At the same time, the \neffective  provision  of  public  services  requires  that  elected  councils,  and  appointed  public \nofficials  who  would  undertake  the  functions  have  appropriate  skills,  competency  and \ncommitment.  Effective provision of public services shall also ensure that local citizens have the \nright to participate in the process of making the decisions concerning the services which impact \non their daily livelihoods; have the right to monitor and evaluate the performance of the elected \ncouncils and appointed officials; and, be able to assess the quality of the provided services. \n \nTherefore, the transfer of responsibilities for providing key and basic public services to sub-\nnational  administrations;  people\u2019s  participation  in  public  administrations;  local  council\u2019s \ncapacity in the decision-making process to respond to the local needs focusing on poverty \nreduction, is core to the process of the sub-national democratic development. \n \n \n  x ", " \n4.   Sub-National Budget, Financial and Property Systems \n \nThe D&D Strategic Framework and Organic Laws demanded that councils at each sub-national \nadministrative level have adequate financial and property resources in order to be able to carry \nout their functions and responsibilities for responding to local citizen\u2019s needs.  For the councils \nto manage the transferred finance and properties with the highest transparency and integrity as \nwell as a high level of accountability to the people and to the Royal Government, the Organic \nLaw provided for the development of the Law on Financial Regime and Property Management \nat sub-national level, which ensures that the council will formulate, approve and implement its \nbudget, with proper financial accounting, management of property and with internal and external \naudits on the council\u2019s budget and finance in accordance with rules, systems and procedures.  \nThis fourth program area also describes the council\u2019s needs in terms of the development of the \n5-year development plan and 3-year rolling investment program which define their council\u2019s \nvisions for own territory\u2019s development. \n \nActivities of the fourth program area defined in each of the platforms supports the council\u2019s \ndecision-making authority on their own plans, finance, budget and property in the response to \ntheir respective local needs in accordance with the principles of local autonomy determined in \nthe Organic Laws. \n \n5.  Support Institutions for D&D Reform Process \n \nThe sub-national administration reform process under the principles of democratic development \nthrough D&D will impact institutions at both national and sub-national levels.  Therefore to \nensure smooth operation of this reform, a strong mechanism is required to coordinate institutions \nat both national and sub-national levels, for the NP-SNDD implementation. \n \nThe coordination among institutions at national level is carried out in the process of reviewing \nfunctions, resources and responsibilities of the national ministries and agencies for the transfer \nto appropriate sub-national council(s) of basic key functions and resources directly impacting on \nthe daily livelihoods of the local communities.  In this process, existing roles and responsibilities \nof national ministries and agencies which cover policy and strategy development, as well as all \nsectoral  program  implementation,  will  be  changed  to  development  of  policy,  strategy  and \nnational standards on the transferred functions. \n \nTo coordinate this complex and in-depth reform, the Organic Law called for the establishment of \na permanent inter-ministerial mechanism to be the arm of the RGC for the implementation of the \nOrganic  Law,  namely  the  National  Committee  for  Sub-National  Democratic  Development, \nabbreviated as NCDD. \n \nThe NP-SNDD has determined the roles and responsibilities of NCDD to coordinate and oversee \nthe  implementation  of  the  NP-SNDD  through  close  cooperation  with  the  Council  for \nAdministrative  Reform  (CAR),  the  PFM  Reform  Committee  and  other  sectoral  reform \nmechanisms on ensuring adequate staffing, capacity, financing and other resources according to \neach implementation phase. \n \nIn conclusion, democratic development does not have an end, but it embeds a process of gradual \nprogress  through  policy  development,  program  implementation  and  lesson  learning,  with \nprogram assessment and review leading to gradual improvement.  \n \n  xi ", " \nThe reform process undertakes careful and serious measures for solving emerging challenges - \nand  for  tackling  new  and  unforeseen  challenges  which  will  emerge  during  NP-SNDD \nimplementation, and require appropriate solutions.

BACKGROUND \n \n1.1.1.  Cambodia\u2019s Economy and Territorial Administrative Structure   \n \nThe  Kingdom  of  Cambodia,  is  a  country  of  181,035  square  kilometers,  with  13,395,682 \ninhabitants (6,879,628 female, equivalent to 51.36%), and a population density of 75 square \nkm1. About 85 percent of the population is farmers who depend on agriculture for livelihood. \nThe agricultural sector is 32.4 percent of the GDP in 2008 and ensures jobs for over 70 percent \nof the population. In addition to agriculture, economic growth has recently been driven by the \ngarment, tourism and construction sectors. As a result, rapid annual average economic growth of \nthe past decade (1999-2008) of about 9.5 percent has increased annual income per capita from \n$281 in 1999 up to $739 USD in 2008, while the poverty rate declined significantly from 34.8 \npercent in 2004 to 30.1 percent in 20072. \n \nThese  achievements  are  under  pressure  from  the  effects  of  the  world  economic  crisis  on \nCambodia\u2019s open economy, which has directly impacted on the garment and tourism sectors. \nThis  crisis  places  a  challenge  on  maintaining  recent  poverty  reduction  achievements,  as \nunemployment  increases,  especially  among  youth.  Further,  the  Royal  Government  of \nCambodia\u2019s (RGC) capacity to address these additional socio-economic stresses will be strained \nas the crisis leads to a decline of tax and revenue collection. Flows of foreign assistance could \nalso decrease as the donor countries face their own domestic fiscal and economic shortfalls.  \n \nAccording to the Constitution of the Kingdom, Cambodia is a unitary state that is not dividable. \nNew Articles 145 and 146 of the Constitution define the territorial administrative management \nsystem of the country. It recognizes the capital, provinces, municipalities, districts, khans, \nCommunes and Sangkats. These administrative units are to be governed in accordance with the \nLaw on the Administrative Management of Capital, Provinces, Districts, Municipalities and \nKhans and the Law on the Administrative Management of Communes and Sangkats. Until the \nend  of  2009,  the  total  number  of  sub-national  administrative  units  includes  1  Capital,  23 \nProvinces, 159 Districts, 26 Municipalities, 8 Khans and 1,621 Communes and Sangkats.  \n \nBefore  February  2002  all  local  administrations  were  appointed  by  government.  These \nadministrations performed duties on behalf of the central government. They were essentially \nagents  of  central  government  to  which  government  delegated  certain  functions  for \nimplementation of its policies. Line ministries have their line departments/agencies at district \nand provincial levels, which carry out the development policies and plans of their ministries. \nUnder this system the central government has retained ownership and responsibility for all \nfunctions that have been delegated to sub-national administrations or line departments. This \ndelegation also includes specific controls and instructions. Local administrations and agencies \nhave  to  respond  and  be  accountable  upwards  to  the  Royal  Government  on  how  it  has \nimplemented the delegated functions.  \n \nTherefore, until 2002, local administrations were essentially agencies of central government. \nCambodia  considered  that  this  governance  is  one  of  \u2018deconcentration\u2019.  Deconcentration  in \nCambodia was deeply rooted, as there were no elected local authorities. \n                                                            \n1 Cambodian Population Census 2008 \n2 The NSDP Update, 2009-2013 \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019  1 ", "Chapter 1: Introduction \nIn March 2001, the Organic Law, including the Law on the Administration Management of \nCommune/Sangkat;  and  the  Law  on  the  Election  of  the  Commune/Sangkat  Council,  was \nadopted. Based on this Law the elections of the Commune/Sangkat Councils were successfully \nheld in February 2002, creating very substantial local authorities. The RGC considered this new \npolicy as Decentralisation and Deconcentration (D&D), as indicated in the 2001 Organic Law. \n \nTherefore, starting from February 2002, the governance at C/S level was substantially changed. \nThe administration created by this election was the means to transfer governance ownership \nfrom the central to the C/S level, ensuring that the C/S councils represent the interests of their \nlocal communities, and being responsive and accountable to their local communities. \n \n1.1.2.  Rationale and Challenges Leading to Continuing Reform \n \nRapid  economic  growth  has  enabled  the  increase  of  expenditures  on  socio-economic \ndevelopment, especially in education, health, agriculture, and infrastructure, aimed at meeting \nthe Cambodian Millennium Development Goals (CMDGs) to reduce poverty and improve the \nquality of life of Cambodian citizens. For, despite considerable real and potential wealth from \nland, as well as natural and human resources, the quality of life of the rural and urban poor in \nCambodia remains well below potential, especially compared to other countries in the region. In \nthis context, the Government\u2019s goals of achieving high economic growth and poverty reduction \nthrough democratic development take on more significance. \n \nThe quality, efficiency and delivery of the public service in Cambodia still remain as challenges \nand cannot yet respond fully to the real needs of the people. Public services which are not \nmeeting the real needs such as (1) The quality of education at primary, secondary and tertiary \nlevels is low; (2) The provision of quality public health services is still limited. In spite of \nnumerous achievements in the health sector, the maternal mortality rate is still high; (3) Progress \nin promoting health care services, sanitation and clean water in rural areas needs to be speeded \nup  to  meet the  targets  set  in the  Millennium  Development  Goals;  (4) Lack  of  education, \ndomestic violence and human trafficking are the major factors that handicap women from \nrealizing their full potential in contributing to socio-economic development; (5) Access to \nelectricity in rural areas is still limited; (6) Road networks remain below the needs; (7) Irrigation \nsystems are still not meeting the needs.3 In the past the RGC paid a lot of attention to the \ndevelopment and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure which was destroyed during the civil \nwar, so as to support the economic growth and to help reduce poverty. But the poor quality of \nexisting infrastructure and the lack of routine operations and maintenance systems caused a \nnegative impact on the sustainability of this infrastructure.  \n \nIn terms of governance, there are four major challenges. First, there is poor administrative \nperformance, accountability and responsiveness to he needs of local communities.  Although the \nCommune councils are elected and have the legal capacity to perform own functions and \nmanage own resources to respond to the local development plan, their performance and capacity \nhave been limited, as functions and financial resources have not been transferred.  Further, the \nmanagement systems and lines of accountability at the provincial and district level are not \nstructured to respond to local needs.   \n \nSecond,  sub-national  service  delivery  and  regulation  of  markets  and  public  goods  are \ncharacterised by a confusing mix of centralised, decentralised and deconcentrated arrangements, \nand also the allocation of the management responsibilities and the use of public goods is still not \n                                                            \n3 The PM\u2019s speech at the 1st Council Ministers\u2019 Meeting of the 4th NA mandate dated 26 Sept 2009 (on the 2nd \nPhase Rectangular Strategy) \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019  2 ", "Chapter 1: Introduction \nclearly  defined  between  central  and  local  governments  and  between  local  administrations \nthemselves.  While  the  technical  capacity  of  government  staff  has  improved,  civil  servant \ndeployment is still not in line with the scale of functions and the priority needs of local \ncommunities. At the same time, conflicting and fragmented assignments of functions to different \nministries has resulted in the creation of multiple sectoral programs that compete and have \nadministrative  management  overlap  amongst  programs,  projects  and  institutional \nresponsibilities.  This has further created complexity for responding to local needs. \n \nThird, multiple conflicting development partner-financed programs exacerbate the problem. The \nfocus on short term investment projects, vertical deconcentration and the use of salary top-ups \nthreaten the institutional reform and long term capacity development envisioned in the Strategic \nFramework for D&D reform. \n \nFourth, in the process of democratic development, there are few functioning accountability \nmechanisms operating outside of elections, and political space for publicly debating, criticizing \nor protesting government policies. \n \n1.2.  POLICY AND STRATEGY FRAMEWORK OF THE DECENTRALIZATION \nAND DECONCENTRATION REFORM IN CAMBODIA \n \nThere are several policy documents of the Royal Government of Cambodia that are important to \ndefining  the  strategic  vision  for  decentralization  and  deconcentration  (D&D).  The  Royal \nGovernment of Cambodia has committed to a policy of good governance. The Rectangular \nStrategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency \u2013 Phase I, was introduced in June \n2004. The core of the Rectangular Strategy is good governance focused on four reform areas: (1) \nanti-corruption,  (2)  legal  and  judicial  reform,  (3)  public  administration  reform  including \ndecentralization and deconcentration, and (4) reform of the armed forces, especially demobilization. \n \nIn June 2005, the government adopted the strategic framework on D&D reform. The strategy aims \nto create a governance system at sub-national levels based on the principles of strengthening local \ndemocracy, promoting community development, and reducing poverty. The government\u2019s long-\nterm D&D reform objective is to broaden sustainable development and lay a strong foundation for \neconomic growth, provide equitable opportunity for all citizens to participate in community \ndevelopment,  promote  sustainable  environmental  and  natural  resource  management,  improve \npublic service delivery in response to people\u2019s needs and alleviate poverty with a special emphasis \non vulnerable groups such as ethnic minorities, women and children. \n \nThe National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) 2006\u20132010 sets out common strategies in the \nefforts to reduce poverty and achieve the Cambodian Millennium Development Goals (CMDG). \nGood governance, again, has been identified as a core pillar of the NSDP, not only in respect to \nthe MDGs and poverty alleviation, but also to increase quality and achieve effectiveness in \npublic service delivery.   \n \nMost recently, at the first Cabinet Meeting of the Fourth Legislature of the National Assembly \nheld on 26 September 2008, in the Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and \nEfficiency \u2013 Phase II, the Government reiterates that it will further pursue... \nthe Decentralization and Deconcentration policy by developing legal and regulatory \nframework and laying out new measures to ensure effective implementation of the \u201cLaw \non the Administrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts \nand Khans on the Administrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, \nDistricts and Khans\u201d, especially the development and implementation of the legal and \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019  3 ", "Chapter 1: Introduction \nregulatory framework related to the transfer of power from the national to sub-national \nadministrations by clearly identifying roles, authority, power, and accountability. \n \nIn this regard, the achievement of D&D reform and delivery of quality and effective public \nservice are pre-requisites for poverty reduction, as well as a major means for strengthening the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to fight corruption and accelerate public administration and public finance \nmanagement reform.  \n \nIn its entirety, the government will retain the regulatory, administrative and investment functions \nas well as the delivery of services and public goods or for those goods that have public merit. \nThese responsibilities can be carried out directly by the government (at any tier) or indirectly by \ncontract with private and not-for-profit organizations. Within the D&D framework, however, it \nis envisioned that each administrative tier of the RGC will play an important but complementary \nrole in carrying out these responsibilities and in meeting the objectives of D&D reform. \n \nThe following should form the basis for a government poli cy on state functional architecture that \nis required for a systematic approach to functional review:  \n\u2022  The primary role of the central government is to create and maintain the enabling \nenvironment  in  which  SNAs  carry  out  sector  strategies,  promote  democratic \ndevelopment and contribute to the reduction of poverty.  They will fulfill this role by \nestablishing the legal foundation in which SNAs govern and that which protect the \nrights  and  interests  of  the  citizens.  Where  uniformity  is  required,  the  central \ngovernment will establish national policies and standards; and establish national \npriorities for the development of the country.   \n\u2022  The provincial administrations will assume a planning and coordinating role and \nmust ensure that their respective allocative decisions address regional inequities, \ntaking into consideration the differing management and fiscal capacities of rural and \nurban areas. Further they will work most directly with the central government and in \nlarge part be held responsible for implementation of national policy to be carried out \nby other SNA through the transfer of functions and resources.   \n\u2022  Districts\u2019, Khans\u2019 and Municipalities\u2019 primary role is to respond to the priority needs \nof the Communes and Sangkats.  It is envisioned, however, that due to economies of \nscale,  functions  will  be  transferred  that  have  district,  khan  and  municipal  wide \nimplications or affect more than one Commune or Sangkat. In this case they will \noffer programs and be the direct service provider for most sub-administrations of \ngovernment in their respective territories.  \n\u2022  Commune and Sangkats as the directly elected governing bodies, are to be the voice \nof the people. As such they are expected to ensure that the development needs of \ntheir territories are met either directly where at all feasible, or through higher levels \nof SNA, as reflected in the functions which will be transferred. Further, they are to \nhold districts, khans,  municipalities, provinces and the capital accountable to the \npeople  through  participation  in  various  decision-making  mechanisms  such  as \nrepresentation on Technical Facilitation Committees and through the right to access \ninformation, the right to monitor and to receive reports from higher tier Councils, and \nthrough mechanisms of accountability that include sanctions for poor performance of \nhigher tier SNAs. \n \n \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019  4 ", "Chapter 1: Introduction \n1.3.  REFORM ACHIEVEMENTS TO DATE  \n \nOver the last 15 years, the RGC has made much progress in achieving government reform. The \nnotion of decentralization and deconcentration is not new in Cambodia, as D&D reform has been \ncarried out since 2002. The Law on Commune/Sangkat Administrative Management was adopted \nto pave the way for implementing reform at the Commune/Sangkat level. Two consecutive \nCommune/Sangkat council elections were organized, in February 2002 and in April 2007.  \n \nThe establishment of elected Commune/Sangkat  councils has shown a number of positive \nresults. First, the Commune/Sangkat council has gained legitimacy as the people\u2019s representative \norgan,  leading  to  a  changed  line  of  accountability  and  the  re-channeling  of  development \nassistance to the Commune/Sangkat council to address local needs. Second, the participatory \nplanning  and  budgeting  procedure  has  allowed  people  to  participate  and  express  their \npreferences in terms of community needs. Third, the decentralization program has contributed to \nsecurity and peace building, and to physical infrastructure improvement leading to economic \ngrowth. Fourth, reform at Commune level has in return strengthened, stabilized and legitimized \nthe central government. The Commune councilors who come from different political parties/ \nideologies and were formerly enemies are now working together to develop their localities. \n \nThese results have largely been achieved through the creation of the Commune/Sangkat Fund, \nwhich has allowed an increase of budget flows to sub-national level, and the RCG has used the \nProvincial Rural Development Committee (PRDC) as the multi-sectoral mechanism at the sub-\nnational level to support the C/S project planning, budgeting and implementation. The share of \nthe national budget allocated to the Commune/Sangkat fund has increased from 1.5% of current \ndomestic revenues in 2002 to 2.7% in 2008.4 The Fund has enabled the Commune/Sangkat \ncouncils  to  respond  directly  to  the  priorities  and  needs  of  their  local  citizens  through \nparticipatory planning and project management. According to the 2002-2006 Commune Project \nDatabase, there were nearly 5,000 water points (including drilled wells and community ponds); \nover 7,000 kilometers of earth and laterite Commune roads (including structures); 730 primary \nschool  rooms;  and  many  small-scale  irrigation,  agriculture,  environment  and  health-related \nschemes financed by this C/S Fund. In the implementation of these projects, the PRDC/EXCOM \nhas  supported  the  C/S  in  managing  projects  and  executing  contracts  and  agreements  in \naccordance with all principles of good governance.  \n \nAdditional financial resources have been accompanied by increased efforts to build capacity at \nthe  sub-national  level.  Thousands  of  Commune  councilors,  Commune  clerks,  provincial \nofficials, and focal persons have been trained in the principles of democratic development and \nparticipatory planning and budgeting.  In 2008, for example, training was provided to 2,454 \ncentral officials and focal persons (of whom 493 were women); 8,373 provincial/municipal \nofficials  (1,059  women);  7,612  Commune/Sangkat  councilors  (1,225  women);  and,  2,485 \nCommune/Sangkat clerks (212 women).5  \n \nSeveral projects and support mechanisms have been formulated that form the foundation for \nmunicipality, district and khan administrations as they participate in the next round of D&D \nreform.  Budget and administrative structures have been created and strengthened in pilot \nmunicipalities, districts and khans, enabling them to provide public services and work with the \ncapital, provinces, and Communes / Sangkats more closely in meeting the needs of the citizens. \nThe One Window Service Office were piloted in Siem Reap and Battambang Districts (now \nMunicipalities). The achievement of this pilot project has encouraged the RGC to expand the \n                                                            \n4 Sub-Decree No. 109 dated 28 August 2007 on State\u2019s Finance Transfer to C/S Fund \n5 Report on the Capacity Developments of NCDD 2008 \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019  5 ", "Chapter 1: Introduction \nestablishment of these offices to other targeted districts and municipalities, in order to further \nstrengthen the role of the district and municipality in providing services, engaging citizens and is \nexpected over time to provide more accountable local government.   \n \nParticipation and understanding about D&D reform from sector and line ministries has been \nsignificant. Ministry representative are members of inter-ministerial committees and working \ngroups dedicated to the development plans that will advance D&D reforms. Ministries are in \nvarious stages of setting up D&D working groups in order to assess what functions of their \nministries should (and how they can) be transferred to the SNAs according to the Law on the \nAdministrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans.  \n \nA  number  of  studies  have  also  shown  that  D&D  reforms  have  significantly  changed  the \nperception of citizens toward the state from one of purely central planning and implementation, \ntowards one that is more consultative, respectful and responsive to the needs of the people.  \n \nBoth the successes and recognition of further improvements have given confidence to the Royal \nGovernment of Cambodia to  move forward its reform  to all sub-national levels including \ndistrict, khan, city, province, and capital. Thus, in 2008, the Organic Law on the Administrative \nManagement of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans was adopted.  \n \n1.4.  THE CHANGE ENVIRONMENT \n \nThe Strategic Framework on Decentralization & Deconcentration (D&D) adopted in June \n2005,  establishes  the  vision  that  guides  governance  reform  for  the  capital,  provinces, \nmunicipalities, districts and khans, and further strengthens the Commune/Sangkat reform. To be \neffective, the principles of democratic development and improvement of public service delivery \nat the sub-national level will only be possible if D&D reform progresses in parallel with the \nPublic Financial Management Reform Program and the National Program of Administrative \nReform.    Public  financial  management  reform  is  carried  out  under  the  guiding  principles \nestablished in the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP); while the strategy \nto  improve  public  service  delivery  through  improvements  in  public  administration,  is \npromulgated in the National Program of Administrative Reform (NPAR).  \n \nIn particular, D&D will interface with PFMRP both directly and indirectly.  The direct interface \nis through Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), initially for the development of the Law on \nFinancial  Regime  and  State  Property  Management  for  Sub-national  Administrations  and \nsubsequently for the implementation of its provisions to establish finance, budget and asset \nmanagement systems at the sub-national level. Indirectly the interface of D&D and PFMRP will \noccur via the line Ministries as they link the PFM budget reforms within their sectors and the \ntransfer of functions and associated resources to Sub-National Administrations (SNAs). \n \nD&D reforms will intersect with the National Program of Administrative Reform to achieve the \nkey objective of assigning authority and accountability for human resources to SNAs to enable \nthem to carry out their functions. In the end, decentralization and deconcentration brings the \npublic finance and public administration reforms, as well as those reforms occurring in priority \nsectors, closer to the people, by ensuring that continued governance reform responds to their \naspirations.  \n \nThese three cross-cutting reforms are foundational to meeting the goals and objectives of the \nnational  strategies  and  are  fundamental  to  democratic  development,  good  governance  and \npoverty reduction. \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019  6 ", "Chapter 1: Introduction \nThis generation of reforms will be complex, multilayered and challenging. The implementation \nof the reform as envisaged:   \n\u2022  Cuts across government in its entirety, transitioning from highly centralized and \nvertical systems of management to one that establishes cross-sector coordination of \nservice delivery through sub-national administrations;   \n\u2022  Requires    a  unified  administration  led  by  new  councils\u2014with    new  lines  of \nauthority\u2014for  khans, districts, municipalities, the capital and provinces;  \n\u2022  Grants citizens more authority to set priorities that influence the Council decisions \nabout the use of resources under their jurisdiction;  \n\u2022  Requires the realigning of lines of accountability between levels of sub-national \nadministration and within those administrations;  \n\u2022  Changes and strengthens the governing environment for Communes and Sangkats, in \nparticular their relationship with Municipal, District and Khan Councils;  \n\u2022  Requires the transfers of authority, finances, personnel, and assets from one tier of \ngovernment to another; and,  \n\u2022  Establishes a multi-tiered management system, avoiding overlap of public service \nprovision  functions,  but  that  allows  for  the  seamless  provision  of  services  and \nprograms.  \n \nThe D&D reform is described to be the most ambitious and important change in Cambodian \ngovernance since the 1993 Constitution.   \n \nSamdech  Akka  Moha  Sena  Padei  Techo  Hun  Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \nCambodia, has also lent his personal and political support for the D&D reform as quoted below: \n \n\u201cCambodia has no better choice than to reform\u2026 The current public administration has \nto be comprehensively reformed more deeply so as to become an efficient and effective \nService Provider and a trusted development partner to fulfill the mission of Serving \nPeople Better\u201d.6 \n \n\u201cThe  Royal  Government  set  out  its  strategic  thinking  on  D&D  in  its  Strategic \nFramework for Decentralization and Deconcentration Reforms in 2005. We have now \nenacted  the  Law  on  the  Administrative  Management  of  the  Capital,  Provinces, \nMunicipalities, Districts and Khans, set a date for elections of the new Councils, and \nestablished the NCDD. These are all important building blocks in the process, but the \nreal implementation work begins now. We have chosen this path in order to achieve \nbroad-based  and  sustainable  development  and  to  strengthen  vital  local  economic \nfoundations. We want every citizen to participate in local development. We want to \nimprove the management and delivery of quality public services to meet local needs and \nultimately reduce poverty. In choosing this path we recognize that the Royal Government \ncannot effectively, efficiently and economically deliver the required range of public \nservices across the whole country from the Capital. By recognizing this and adopting the \nD&D policy approach, we are deciding to fundamentally change the way the Royal \nGovernment  carries  out  its  business.  Essentially  we  are  setting  up  a  new  local \ngovernment  system  and  transferring  functions,  including  service  delivery  functions, \ntogether with financial, human and other resources from central to local government.\u201d7 \n \n                                                            \n6 The Policy on Public Service adopted by the Council of Ministers on 05 May 2006  \n7 Speech of Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen  on the Announcement of Progress and Plans for \nD&D 28/01/09 (NCDD) \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019  7 ", "Chapter 1: Introduction \n1.5.  METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH  \n \nThe formulation by the RGC of the 10-Year National Program for Sub-national Democratic \nDevelopment (NP-SNDD) starts from the accomplishments of the last 15 years. In keeping with \nthe principle of steady but thoughtful reform and recognizing that the implementation of the 10-\nYear Program will only happen through commitment from and broad-based support of all \nbranches of the Royal Government of Cambodia, it was necessary that the process for the \nformulation of the NP allow for the widest participation of representatives from government \nministries and agencies, sub-national administrators, development partners, and non-government \norganizations as possible. The formulation process also ensured that the lessons learned from \npast accomplishments were captured in order to inform the next phase of reform.   \n \nTo that end, a series of dialogues were held that allowed for the emergence of a consensus view \non the key issues that will define the principles and the parameters of the reform effort.8 The \nthemes of the dialogues reflected the important aspects of democratic development through \ndecentralization and deconcentration articulated in the Strategic Framework for Decentralization \nand  Deconcentration  Reform,  the  Law  on  the  Administrative  Management  of  the  Capital, \nProvinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans) and the Law on the Administrative Management \nof Communes and Sangkats. Themes of the Dialogues included:  \n\u2022  Overall Objectives of the D&D Process \n\u2022  Assignment of Local Functions and Responsibilities \n\u2022  Local Finances and Budget \n\u2022  Accountability, Oversight and Responsiveness \n\u2022  Local Management and Administration \n \nIn addition to the 5 main dialogues, considerable emphasis was placed on working individually \nwith and through ministries on transfer of functions, resources and personnel. Pre- and post-\ndialogue working meetings were held in key ministries in order to further elaborate the strategies \nfor D&D reform within priority sectors.  \n \nThe results of this inclusive approach have laid a firm foundation from which to commence the \nimplementation of program activities.  Additional data were collected from multiple sources that \naugmented the results of the Dialogues. In total they provide the documentation from which the \nNP-SNDD was formed.  \n \n1.5.1.  Guiding Principles \n \nThe NP-SNDD reflects a set of guiding principles derived from the Royal Government of \nCambodia national strategies, policy papers and laws related to overall development of the \ncountry and specifically to D&D reform.  The guiding principles are:  \n\u2022  Ensure the core values and principles of democratic development, as stated in the \npolicy objective in Chapter 2, are realized;   \n\u2022  Be careful in the process of establishing the roles, responsibilities and working \nprocedures of the new Councils, and in the transfer of functions to ensure that the \nreform will not interfere with Commune/Sangkat council affairs or make decisions \nthat affect the rights of those councils;  \n\u2022  Overcome  current  difficulties  resulting  from  years  of  functioning  as  a  highly \ncentralized government;  \n\u2022  Encourage changes of behavior and attitudes towards work performance necessary \nfor the new administrative structure to operate and achieve results as expected; \n                                                            \n8 A summary of the Dialogues is provided in Annex 1. \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019  8 ", "Chapter 1: Introduction \n\u2022  Allow for the immediate needs of the people to be addressed;  \n\u2022  Ensure that people, especially women, vulnerable groups and ethnic minorities, can \nparticipate  in  decision-making  at  provincial  /  municipal,  district  /  khan  and \nCommune / Sangkat levels; \n\u2022  Encourage flexibility in order to accommodate social, political and economic change; \n\u2022  Integrate  appropriate  consideration  of  environmental  issues,  especially  climate \nchange, into SNA activities at all levels; \n\u2022  Be based on a legal and regulatory framework; and,  \n\u2022  Promote interdependency / close cooperation between the national and sub-national \nadministrations. \n \n1.5.2.  Logical Framework \u2013 Key Concepts \n \nThe NP \u2013 SNDD uses a logical framework approach as a way to organize the data, and present \nthe expected outcomes/outputs and main activities.   It is structured as follows:  \n\u2022  Goal: overall results the RGC expects to achieve from the implementation of the \nnational program.   \n\u2022  Objective: desired result of the NP that will contribute to achieving the overall goal, \n\u2022  Outputs: result of Program Areas that will contribute to achieving the objective. \n\u2022  Indicators: \n\u2212  Impact Indicators \u2013 measure the overall effect of D&D reform on national goals. \n\u2212  Program Indicators \u2013 measure progress toward achieving NP vision.  \n\u2022  Platform \u2013 Concrete time segments demarcated by reaching expected targets on the \noverall path to achieving program results.  \n \n1.6.  STRUCTURE AND FLOW OF THE DOCUMENTS \n \nThe National Program for Sub-national Democratic Development (NP-SNDD) outlined in this \ndocument defines the policies and programs necessary to carry out the vision of the Royal \nGovernment of Cambodia and then provides an outline of the steps that must be taken to \nimplement the 10 Year Program, and the management responsibilities of the NCDD. \n \nChapter 1 provides this introduction to the NP-SNDD, outlining the background to, and rationale \nfor the reforms, the relevant RGC policies and strategies, the achievements to date, the current \nchange environment and guiding principles.  \n \nChapter 2 describes the RGC\u2019s vision and policy commitments. The overarching approach to \nD&D reform and the logical relationship between creating strong SNA institutions and the \nGovernment\u2019s  objectives  of  promoting  democratic  development,  improvement  of  service \ndelivery and reduction of poverty through decentralization and deconcentration is provided.   \n \nIn Chapter 3 the critical actions necessary to institutionalize D&D, set out under 5 Programme \nAreas, are detailed. Program Area 1 sets out the actions necessary to ensure that SNAs govern \ndemocratically and efficiently; Program Areas 2 focuses on the issues related to management \nand development of SNA human resources; Program Area 3 defines the steps necessary to \ntransfer  functions  and  improve  the  delivery  of  services  through  SNAs;  Program  Area  4 \nprovides a comprehensive SNA finance and budgeting system; and, Program Area 5 identifies \nboth  the  institutional  enabling  environment  required  to  support  SNAs  and  the  necessary \nadjustments of existing institutions and organizations to ensure that they are aligned with the \nRGC\u2019s new governing structure created through D&D reform.  \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019  9 ", "Chapter 1: Introduction \nChapter 4 provides an overview of the management activities necessary to implement the NP-\nSNDD,  including  the  NCDD  management  structure  and  approach  that  will  be  taken  to \nimplement the 10-Year Program, the M&E Framework and its link to the five program areas and \nthe risk assessment which highlights the impact of failure to address the critical actions and steps \noutlined in the 10-Year Program.   \n \nChapter 5 addresses the financial issues including financing mechanisms and a 1-Year Indicative \nProgram and Cost Estimate.   \n \nThe following Annexes are attached to the NP-SNDD: \n\u2022  Annex 1: Summary Outcomes from the Five Dialogues  \n\u2022  Annex 2: Gender Mainstreaming in Sub-National Administrations  \n\u2022  Annex 3: Accountability of Sub-National Administrations \n \n&\u00b0'\nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019  10 ", " \nChapter 2 \nSTRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR \nSUB-NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC \nDEVELOPMENT \n ", "Chapter 2: Strategic Framework for Sub-National Democratic Development   \nCHAPTER 2 \n STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK  \nFOR SUB-NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT \n \nDuring the mandate of the fourth legislature (2008\u20132013), the RGC reform will continue to \nfocus on enhanced effectiveness in implementation of policy and delivery and management of \npublic goods, especially better public services delivery in order to respond to the aspirations of \nthe  people.  Sub-national  democratic  development  will  allow  progress  to  be  made  on  the \ncommitment of improved service delivery that protects community assets, provides for better \nnatural resource management, improves resilience to climate change, promotes a low carbon \ndevelopment pathway, and responds to the social, physical and economic needs of individuals \nand households. In this way, sub-national democratic development will allow SNAs to make a \ngreater contribution to the alleviation of poverty and sustained economic growth.   \n \n2.1.  RGC VISION FOR SUB-NATIONAL DEMOCRATIC DEVELOPMENT  \n \nTo continue to make progress on our commitment to democratic development, the RGC vision is \nto \u201cDevelop management systems of provincial/municipal, district/khan and Commune/Sangkat \nlevels based on the principles of \u201cdemocratic participation\u201d.  These systems will operate with \ntransparency and accountability in order to promote local development and delivery of public \nservices to meet the needs of citizens and contribute to poverty reduction within the respective \nterritories.\u201d 9  \n \nThe vision and objectives of the Strategic Framework for D&D reform, and of the Organic Law \nis to establish, improve and support sustainable democratic development.   \n \nDemocratic development defined in the Law on the Administrative Management of the Capital, \nProvinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans (Article 12), is clear in that there is to be an \noverall governing structure that allows for (1) Public representation, (2) Local autonomy, (3) \nConsultation and participation, (4) Responsiveness and accountability (5) Promotion of equality \nof life of the local residents, (6) Promotion of equity,(7) Transparency and integrity, and (8) \nMeasures to fight corruption and abuse of power.  \n \nTo ensure better quality of life for local people, sub-national level councils have to have the \nappropriate roles, authority and resources.  \n \nThe success of this reform depends mainly on the concept that each sub-national council has to \nhave a unified administration.     \n \nThe  establishment  of  the  unified  administrations  at  the  sub-national  level  reflects  the \ncommitment of the RGC to transfer clear roles and responsibilities to these sub-national councils \nto coordinate all administrative activities [those of the SNA and the line ministries/offices] in \ntheir jurisdictions in order to promote public service delivery and local development. The \neffectiveness of service delivery depends on the transfer of authority in the key service delivery \nareas to the sub-national administrations. This principle requires line ministries to review their \nown service delivery functions, for transfer to sub-national administrations, and also review their \nown legal and regulatory frameworks to ensure that they are aligned with the Organic Laws. \nThis will ensure that each council will be able to fully respond to the service delivery needs and \nto the coordination of service delivery activity and local development. Further, reporting and \n                                                            \n9 Strategic Framework for Decentralization and Deconcentration Reform, 17 June 2005.  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   11 ", "Chapter 2: Strategic Framework for Sub-National Democratic Development   \nmonitoring lines of accountability between the Council - Board of Governor - Line Ministry and \ntheir offices are necessary for the Councils to make informed decisions.  \n \nFinally, the vision stated allows for the activities carried out within each administrative territory \nto mirror local demographic, geographic, social, and economic conditions. Councils will have \nthe  mandate  to  speak  for  their  citizens  in  setting  priorities  for  the  development  of  their \ncommunities. This process requires the participation of people in decision making relating to \npublic services, where people have the right to monitor the activities of the SNA and to hold \nCouncils accountable for their actions. Correspondingly, Councils will have the resources and \nthe authority to make allocative decisions that cross sectors and ministerial lines. The result will \nbe more responsive government and improvements in service delivery.  \n \n2.2.  RGC POLICY COMMITMENTS   \n \nThe RGC commitment to democratic development shall be actualized in accordance with the \nfollowing policies:    \n1.  Give increasingly greater authority to SNAs through the assignment of functions.  \n2.  Ensure that Councils have discretionary authority to make cross-sector allocative \ndecisions to meet the priority needs of their citizens. \n3.  Ensure the participation of the people in the decision-making process of the Councils \nat sub-national level, and in monitoring and evaluating the work performance of the \nelected Council and staff, including the Board of Governors, to ensure that they are \nresponsive and accountable to the people. Determine the forms of accountability that \nare desirable within the structure of sub-national government, and create mechanisms \nto deliver these. \n4.  Transfer obligatory and permissive functions to all SNA Councils in accordance with \nthe  Law  on  the  Administrative  Management  of  the  Capital,  Provinces, \nMunicipalities, Districts and Khans, which states that functions will be transferred \naccording the following principles: \n\u2022  Relevant to jurisdiction of the council; \n\u2022  Manageable and practical for the council\u2019s jurisdiction;  \n\u2022  Beneficial and useful for residents within the council\u2019s jurisdiction; and  \n\u2022  Major impact within the council\u2019s jurisdiction.  \n5.  Establish a funding mechanism that gives Councils discretion over conditional and \nunconditional revenue sources which corresponds with requisite responsibility and \nauthority and for which over time the balance of unconditional transfers will increase \nrelative to conditional transfers.  \n6.  SNA councils will be empowered to exercise their discretion in setting the bases \nand/or rates of their own source revenues within the national set rates.  \n7.  Transfer the control over the SNA civil service to the council, granting Councils the \nauthority to hire, fire, promote and assign personnel in accordance with civil service \ncode.  \n8.  Enforce  actions  that  increasingly  integrate  women  into  the  governing  process, \nincrease access to services, and ensure women\u2019s and other marginalized groups \npriority needs receive resources. \n \nThese  policies  must  be  carried  out  through  appropriate  legal  instruments  and  operational \nprocedures of ministries and institutions of the Royal Government relating to management, \ndistribution of responsibilities and resources to capital, provincial, municipal, district, khan, \nCommune and Sangkat levels. Further, the actions taken must be consistent with the objectives \nand principles of the Strategic Framework of Decentralization and Deconcentration, and the \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   12 ", "Chapter 2: Strategic Framework for Sub-National Democratic Development   \nprovisions  of  the  Law  on  Administrative  Management  of  Capital,  Province,  Municipality, \nDistrict and Khan, and the Law on Administrative Management of Commune and Sangkat.  \n \n2.3.  NP- IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK  \n \n2.3.1.  Goal and Objectives \n \nThe Goal of the NP-SNDD is to achieve democratic, inclusive and equitable development, \nimproved  access,  quality  and  utilization  of  service  delivery  and  contribution  to  poverty\u2019s \nreduction. \n \nThe Objective of the NP-SNDD is to develop management systems of provincial/municipal, \ndistrict/khan and Commune/Sangkat levels based on the principles of democratic participation \nthat will operate with transparency and accountability in order to promote local development \nand delivery of public services to meet the needs of citizens and contribute to poverty reduction \nwithin the respective territories. \n \nGood governance has been identified as a core pillar of development to increase quality of, and \nachieve effectiveness in public service delivery as well as to alleviate poverty in accordance \nwith the Millennium Development Goals.  In the NSDP, the government is committed to \nimplement fundamental principles that can lead the country for prosperity such as: \n\u201c\u2026strict adherence to democracy in governance, where all citizens are able at regular \nintervals to freely elect their representatives to govern at national and sub-national \nlevels and government institutions at all levels have to be fully responsive, responsible, \neffective, transparent, accountable and predictable.  In this way, essential social services \nfor human capital formation and enhancement -- health, education, cultural development \nwill  be  created;  enabling  individuals  to  seek  and  realize  their  full  potential  and \ncontribute to their own well-being and the country's growth\u201d.10  \n \nThe  RGC  recognizes  the  important  role  of  SNAs  in  addressing  the  socio-economic  and \nenvironmental  challenges  facing  Cambodia,  and  so  the  RGC  is  prepared  to  transfer \nresponsibility, authority and resources to SNAs so that they can address the problems that face \nthe people who live in their jurisdiction. Commune and Sangkat Councils and local communities \nin Cambodia are already responding to the crises that they face. The establishment of councils at \ncapital, provinces, municipal, district, and khan level expand the points at which citizens can \nengage with the government to address socioeconomic and environmental challenges.  \n \nThe long-term sustainability of addressing these challenges remains an issue. It is not sufficient \nto only establish the policies and transfer the resources. SNAs must work effectively.  This \nmeans that there is a need for systems and procedures to be in place that allows for officials to \nuse authority and resources transferred to them in response to the needs of the people of the \ncountry and the expectations of the RGC.   \n \nTo that end, it is necessary to have strong, just and accessible sub-national institutions and \nensure that: \n\u2022  SNAs, ministries and other institutions are aware of citizen's needs,  \n\u2022  Institutionalization of administrative and fiscal management reform to sustainably \nrespond to people\u2019s needs,  \n\u2022  Citizens can play a meaningful role in holding officials to account, and  \n                                                            \n10 National Strategic Development Plan 2006-2010  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   13 ", "Chapter 2: Strategic Framework for Sub-National Democratic Development   \n\u2022  Each  council  of  SNAs  has  full  capacity  to  effectively  coordinate  all  public \nadministration activities in the SNA\u2019s respective jurisdiction.  In this respect, over \ntime Councils will be granted more authority to allocate funding across sectors as \nwell as within sectors.  \nThe NP-SNDD Implementation Framework delineates the scope and approach of programs that \nensures these expectations will be met.  Further, it has been designed to respond to the complex \nset of challenges recognized in Chapter 1, Section 1.4, which can become barriers to reform if \nnot properly addressed.  Finally, it lays the foundation that will allow for the assistance provided \nby development partners to move toward greater use of government systems, a fundamental \nelement of creating democratic sub-national administrations.    \n \n2.3.2.  Scope of NP-SNDD Implementation Framework  \n \nThe  National  Program  Implementation  Framework  focuses  on  those  facets  of  government \noperations, systems, and structures that will contribute to and result in democratically governed \nand effectively managed sub-national administrations. The 10 Year Program requires that a \nrange of actions be taken; from drafting and adopting the legal instruments necessary to codify \nthe  policy  commitments  to  implementing  programs  that  ensure  that  the  expected  benefits \nderived from the policy commitments will be forthcoming.  \n \nA).  Inter-Linking Program Design  \n \nThe NP-SNDD is structured around five program areas that interlink to form the institutional \ncapacity  which  supports  and  allows  for  the  realization  of  the  D&D  reform  goals.  The \npresentation of the program areas is not to imply a sequential order of actions in support of D&D \nreform, but rather recognizes the iterative nature of government reform and the interlocking \nnature of government operations and systems.  Activities of the five NP-SNDD Program Areas \nare described below:     \n\u2022  Program Area 1 \u2013 SNA Organization Development  \u2013 ensures that the fundamental \norganizational  infrastructure  is  in  place  that  facilitates  the  making  of  decisions, \ncodifies the allocation of authority within the SNA and between different tiers and \ninstitutionalizes mechanisms which ensure democratic practices are legitimized and \ncitizens\u2019 rights are protected. \n\u2022  Program Area 2 \u2013 Human Resource Management and Development Systems  \u2013 \nallows for the transformation of management of civil servants and other personnel at \nthe sub-national level. Achieving the results defined in this program area changes the \nincentives for civil service performance from one which focuses on completing tasks \nto one of serving citizens. Management of personnel from this perspective is essential \nfor the improvement of service delivery. \n\u2022  Program Area 3 \u2013 Transfer of Functions \u2013 is core to the overall reform as it defines \na) the responsibility and authority that will be executed through the institutional \nstructure established in Program Area 1 and b) the resources that must be managed in \naccordance  with  those  systems,  operating  procedures  and  practices  advanced  in \nProgram Areas 1, 2 and 4.    \n\u2022  Program Area 4 \u2013 Budget, Financial and Asset Management Systems \u2013 contributes \nto two dimensions of the NP design. One, it establishes the financial systems and \noperating framework  necessary for the management of fiscal resources (i.e. revenues \nand assets) and two, it defines the mechanisms for  financing SNA activities.  \n\u2022  Program  Area  5  \u2013  Support  Institutions  for  D&D  \u2013  ensures  the  necessary \ninstitutional arrangements and missions of institutions that will advance D&D reform \nand enable SNA to govern and manage effectively and sustainably.  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   14 ", "Chapter 2: Strategic Framework for Sub-National Democratic Development   \nB).   Cross-cutting Programs \n \nThree cross-cutting themes are interwoven into the five program areas: gender mainstreaming, \nclimate change and accountability.  \n \nB-1).  Gender Mainstreaming  \n \nGender  mainstreaming  in  NP-SNDD  is  defined  as  promoting  gender  equality  and  the \nempowerment of women in the broader governance arena, and particularly women\u2019s role in \ndecision-making, and improving their access to services. NP-SNDD capitalizes on the entry \npoints and opportunities created in its five program areas to increase opportunities for, and \nempowerment of women and aims to ensure that all services they need are available. Proposed \nactivities under the NP-SNDD will increase women\u2019s, ethnic minorities\u2019 and other vulnerable \ngroups\u2019  access  to  services  and  control  over  development  resources  directed  at  improving \nlivelihoods.  Concrete activities concerning gender mainstreaming are described in the Annex 2.  \n \nB-2).  Climate Change \n \nThe impact of climate change in Cambodia will be unprecedented and will require effective \ngovernment leadership at all levels to respond to the increasing global threat to life, livelihoods \nand life-supporting systems. There is an urgent need to adopt low carbon development agendas, \nbut at the same time to prepare for the new climate risks threatening Cambodia. NP-SNDD \nprovides key entry points required to create a national \u201cadaptation system\u201d that will support \nsociety in the long-term, iterative process of adjusting as the climate changes. \n \nB-3).  Accountability and Protection of the Poor and Disenfranchised Groups \n \nThe National Program will make SNA procedures more transparent so the public can observe \nand take action.  Implementation of the Law on the Administrative Management of the Capital, \nProvinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans and NP-SNDD implies the establishment of new \nlines  of  accountability,  creating  awareness  and  establishing  systems,  procedures,  and \nmechanisms to ensure that citizens\u2019 rights are protected, voice is heard and resources are utilized \nin accordance with the law.  \n \nCitizens will have the legal right to access information about the decisions and actions of the \ncouncils. Mechanisms also need to be established to deliver appropriate means for citizens to \nevaluate the activities of councils, and to hold them to account for poor performance. As such \nthe approaches to achieving accountability must be incorporated into all elements of government \nreform; the legislative process as well as the administrative process.   \n \nTo ensure accountability is achieved throughout the SNA, the following actions are woven \nthrough each of the Program Areas.   \n\u2022  Clarify goals and objectives for accountability.  \n\u2022  Review existing accountability practices and test new ones for their ability to meet \nthe government\u2019s goals and objectives with respect to accountability, as a basis for \nthe establishment of national guidelines and operating procedures; \n\u2022  Legitimize those articles within the Law on Administrative Management of Capital, \nProvince, Municipality, District and Khan that address lines of accountability by \nassigning penalties within the regulations that promulgate the articles; \n\u2022  Legally mandate citizen\u2019s right to public information;   \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   15 ", "Chapter 2: Strategic Framework for Sub-National Democratic Development   \n\u2022  Take  affirmative  actions  in  expanding  civil  societies\u2019  understanding  of  D&D, \nincluding the potential benefits. \n\u2022  f.) Strengthen mechanisms for citizens\u2019 recourse if SNA violate citizens\u2019 rights as \nthey relate to legal requirements.  \n \nAccountability mechanisms that institutionalize administrative, financial and legal accountability \nand that ensure that the voice and rights of the people are protected through the D&D reform \nfollow specific lines of accountability.11  \n \nFour lines of accountability are implied in the NP-SNDD:  \n1.  Internal accountability which is within a unit of SNA or among the SNAs own \nentities  \n2.  Intra-SNA accountability, which refers to accountability among/between SNAs or \nunits of SNAs, at the same or different levels. \n3.  Inter-governmental accountability, which is between the central government, line \nMinistries, institutions and departments with SNAs.  \n4.  Accountability of SNAs to citizens refers to political accountability between SNA \nand citizens in their jurisdiction.  \n \nEach of the program areas weaves in one or more of the lines of accountability, as indicated \nbelow: \n \nProgram Area 1 will be a key locus for the exercise of all four lines of accountability, in the \nmanner as follows: \n\u2022  internal accountability, via the establishment of rule based administrative systems \nand  reporting requirements; \n\u2022  intra-SNA  accountability,  particularly  in  respect  to  the  C/S  support  units  to  be \nestablished by the districts and in respect to lines of reporting among/between the \nvarious tiers of SNAs; \n\u2022  inter-governmental accountability is implied via the horizontal coordination and line \ndepartments in the context of unified administration; and, \n\u2022  accountability to citizens through i) surveys of citizen satisfaction with services; ii) \nIT to increase citizen access to information and services; iii) guidelines, instructions \nand  instruments  for  consultation,  information  and  participation  of  citizens;  (iv) \ndevelopment of citizens engagement programs and various mechanisms of citizen \ninvolvement.   \n \nUnder Program Area 2, internal accountability will be exercised through specific roles for \nmanagement of civil service and HRM system as well as guidelines regarding expectations of \nstaff involvement with the citizens, while inter-governmental accountability will be implied \nthrough the process of line ministry personnel redeployment concurrent with functional and \nresource transfer.  \n \nProgram Area 3 will have a bearing on inter-governmental accountability via the manner in \nwhich functions to be transferred to SNAs will be defined (including resources and personnel to \nensure  that  service  provision  is  not  disrupted);  and  the  mechanisms  for  monitoring  and \nreviewing  implementation  of  transferred  functions.  SNA accountability  to  citizens  may  be \nexpressed eventually through improvements in quantity and quality of services provided, but in \nthe interim, specific measures for promoting accountability with respect to different types of \nservices and other functions will be required, and these should be piloted and their effectiveness \n                                                            \n11 A Legal Analysis of the Accountability Mechanisms is provided in Annex 3.  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   16 ", "Chapter 2: Strategic Framework for Sub-National Democratic Development   \nevaluated against the government\u2019s goals and objectives in this area. Further accountability to \ncitizens may be promoted via public hearings and public access to information about SNA \nperformance of functions/services, and piloting of different approaches to these, and monitoring \nof their effectiveness, will be required. \n \nProgram  Area  4  will  be  another  key  locus  for  the  exercise  of  the  following  lines  of \naccountability: \n\u2022  internal  accountability  (horizontal)  \u2013  via  internal  audit,  relations  and  processes \nbetween council and Board of Governors (BoG)/Administration in respect to budget \nimplementation; \n\u2022  intra-SNA accountability(vertical and horizontal/upward and downward), particularly \nfor  sharing  of  specified  revenues  between  district  and  the  Communes/Sangkats \nwithin the district; \n\u2022  inter-governmental  accountability  (vertical/upward)  is  exercised  through  MEF \nfinancial inspections and National Audit Authority (NAA) audits of SNA financial \nperformance; and, \n\u2022  accountability  of  SNA  to  citizens  (horizontal/downward)  in  respect  to  budget \ndevelopment,  choices,  and  implementation;  public  hearings  related  to  budget, \ninvestment, development issues should be developed, and pilots conducted with \nrespect to social auditing, and the possibility of inserting requirements for citizens or \nCommune councils to formally approve budgets as a means of exercising authority \nover higher levels of government.  \n \nUnder Program Area 5, the establishment of an administrative mediation and conflict resolution \nmechanism will ensure a means to reinforce internal accountability processes of SNAs. \n \nThere are specific mechanisms by which councils are or can be held accountable for ensuring \nthat women, vulnerable groups, ethnic minorities and the poor have access to public services and \nthat those services are provided in an equitable manner.  \n  \n2.4.  NP-SNDD RATIONALE  \n \nUnder  this  generation  of  reforms,  SNAs  will  be  increasingly  held  responsible  for  the \ndevelopment of their territories, protecting the rights of their citizens, and providing sustainable \npublic services on an ongoing basis.    \n \nAs functions are transferred, Councils must convert development priorities, as articulated by \ncitizens and required by the national government, into routine operations and use their authority \nand resources in a way that ensures investments are protected, that the quality and quantity of \nservices provided improves and that these improvements can be sustained over time.  This \nrequires that the necessary institutional infrastructure as represented in the five program areas.   \n \nWithout the necessary institutional infrastructure, Councils will not be able to efficiently meet \nthe needs of the people. More importantly, without the institutional infrastructure it will be \nnearly impossible for citizens to hold the Councils accountable.  \n \nFinally,  without  creating  the  necessary  institutional  infrastructure,  the  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration reform would not be able to achieve the national goals of improved service \ndelivery, democratic development and poverty reduction. \n  \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   17 ", "Chapter 2: Strategic Framework for Sub-National Democratic Development   \n2.5.  NP-SNDD CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT   \n \nBuilding  the  capacity  of  individuals  and  the  institutions  will  be  necessary  to  ensure  the \nestablishment, promotion and sustainability of development through the D&D, and is a critical \ncomponent of the NP-SNDD. The immensity of the challenge will generate significant and \nmultifaceted demands which will require multiple approaches.  \n \nFor  the  purposes  of  the  National  Program,  capacity  development  is  defined  as  providing \ntechnical support, learning opportunities and requisite information, data, equipment, systems and \nprocedures that allow individuals and institutions to achieve the results envisaged from sub-\nnational democratic development. Thus defined, capacity development enables and therefore \nbecomes the pre-requisite for individuals and institutions to undertake technical, management, or \nadministrative work themselves.   \n \nThe Capacity Development Plan is designed to address the immediate needs of individuals and \ninstitutions to carry out their respective levels of responsibility and authority at each SNA level. \nFurther, it is designed to leave in place Cambodian institutions that have the ability to develop \ntheir own organizations and build the requisite capacity of individuals. As such the Capacity \nDevelopment  Plan  is  interlinked  to  the  Program  Areas  outcomes/outputs.  The  Capacity \nDevelopment Plan will be developed during the first semester of 2010.  \n \nThe NP-SNDD provides for the following arrangements to support capacity development: \n1.  The NCDD Secretariat will oversee the implementation of the capacity development \nplan as provided for in the plan document. The Plan includes a description of the \napproach  that  will  be  taken  for  delivering  TA,  training,  development  of  pilot \nprograms, etc.; the management of capacity development; and a detailed list of core \ncompetencies required by sub-national officials that correspond with the program \noutputs defined in Chapter 3.   \n2.  Technical assistance will be provided to institutions whose mission includes building \ncapacity of individuals and institutions, such as the Royal School of Administration, \nthe  National  League  of  Commune  and  Sangkats  and  the  Ministry  of  Interior\u2019s \nDepartment of Personnel and Vocational Training.  The main outputs required to \nbuild the capacity of these institutions is described in Program Area 5. It is expected \nthat by Platform 2 these institutions will assume greater responsibility in defining and \nbuilding capacity of individuals and institutions.     \n3.  In time, sub-national administrations themselves will assume the responsibility of \nbuilding the capacity of their respective organizations and individuals.  This is a \nprimary responsibility of any government institution. Program Area 2 outlines the \nnecessary outputs for SNAs to assume this responsibility. It is expected that by \nPlatform 2, SNAs will identify needs and secure resources for capacity development. \n4.  Funds for capital and equipment requirements will be provided to ensure that SNAs\u2019 \nminimal operating environment is in place. Capital and equipment inventories of \neach SNA will determine the demand.   \n \n2.6.  LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT \n \nFor development to occur services must be predictable, affordable and reliable.  Further, for \nindividuals, services must be accessible and link to their ability to gain access to income \ngenerating activities. The development interest of private investors and individuals often have \ncontrasting objectives that the SNAs must address through the planning process, when making \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   18 ", "Chapter 2: Strategic Framework for Sub-National Democratic Development   \nbudget allocations and determining how to improve the access to services. . \nThe National Program, in its entirety, lays out the means for these ends to be achieved. This \nrequires, as noted above, that SNAs have the discretion to make optimal choices. They must, \nhowever, also address the predictability, affordability and reliability of service and this requires \nthe skills, systems and knowledge to effectively manage the resources over which they have \ndiscretion.     \n \nThe NP specifically addresses approaches to improving the predictability, affordability and \nreliability of service delivery; broadly through the transfer of functions, and more specifically by \nbuilding the capacity of SNAs to work with community groups and line office to develop service \nimprovement targets and action plans.  Consideration will be given to the transfer of functions \nover which SNAs can have the greatest effect with regard to local economic development. They \nwill be given the responsibility and authority to develop and manage services and resources that \nare linked to those economic sectors in which Cambodia has its greatest comparative advantage.   \n \n2.7.  NP-SNDD PLATFORM PERIOD AND EXPECTED RESULTS \n \nThe  10-Year  National  Program  for  Sub-national  Democratic  Development  (NP-SNDD)  is \norganized around a logical framework and anticipates three broad implementation phases / \nplatforms over the period from 2010 to 2019.  \n \nEach platform period will correspond to and be defined by the adoption and implementation of \nD&D policy and legal instruments:  \n\u2022  That transfer functions, local finances and assets, and personnel necessary for the \nformation of viable SNAs with significant pro-poor service responsibilities and the \ncorresponding discretionary authority and resources; and, \n\u2022  That  achieves  full  and  effective  accountability  of  SNAs,  with  emphasis  on \nthe accountability of elected sub-national councils to citizens. \n \nPlatforms, by definition, create a base or foundations on which other activities occur that \ncontribute to achieving the expected outcomes.  The Platform periods reflect the practical nature \nof implementing such a far reaching and comprehensive reform program, taking into account the \namount of time it will take to adjust, coordinate and adopt individual and institutional changes. \nThe NP-SNDD is organised around three Platforms, the first two Platforms are three years each \nand the last Platform is four years (3-3-4). This provides sufficient time for a fair assessment of \nreform efforts and necessary adjustments to be made. A complete SNA development planning \ncycle can be completed in each Platform and Platform 1 and 2 correspond with first full elected \nterm of Councils of the Capital, Province, Municipality, District and Khan. The progress made \nwill be monitored and evaluated, as described in the M&E section 4.2.  The ongoing M&E \nreports will inform the movement to subsequent outputs and activities.   \n \nAs the D&D policy and legal instruments are adopted and NP-SNDD programs reflecting them \nare implemented, institutional change will occur.  Table 2.1 below outlines the goal, expected \ninstitutional changes and institutional results for each Platform. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   19 ", "Chapter 2: Strategic Framework for Sub-National Democratic Development   \nTable 2.1   NP-SNDD Platform Periods and Results \n \nResults in Each Platform\nDescriptions \nPlatform 1 (2010\u20132012)  Platform 2 (2013-2015)  Platform 3 (2016-2019) \nEstablish and  Strengthen and broaden the  Adjust programs and deepen \ninstitutionalize governing  established system and  impact by replicating lessons \nsystems and structures at the  structures, ensuring that the  learned and ensuring that the \nsub-national and national  SNAs can adopt and execute  SNDD programs correspond to \nGoal  level that ensure  local policies that result in  and reflect new policies and \nimplementation of policies and  improved  public services and  strategies of the Royal \nthe effective and efficient  increased access to public  Government of Cambodia. \ndelivery of public services by  services for women and the \nSNAs.  disenfranchised \nCouncils will be the  The line of accountability  Ministries become \nInstitutional  established and recognized  between ministries and SNAs  increasingly responsible for \nChange  decision making body of  will be increased to the  creating the enabling \n  SNAs   Council as more functions are  environment in which SNAs \nassigned.   carry out sector strategies.  \n\u2022  SNA officials will have  \u2022  Review the functions that  \u2022  SNAs are increasingly held \nmastered the basic  have been transferred  responsible for the quality \ncompetencies necessary for  during Platform 1 and  of and access to services  \nD&D reform  transfer additional  \u2022  Line ministries and SNAs \n\u2022  Legal framework  necessary  functional responsibilities in  work jointly with citizens to \nfor Law on the  each of the priority sectors  achieve national \nAdministrative  to  SNAs   development goals.  \nManagement of the Capital,  \u2022  SNAs act with more  \u2022  Cross-sector allocative \nProvinces, Municipalities,  administrative  decision-making enabled at \nDistricts and Khans to be  independence as core  the SNA level. \nactualized will be in place.   competencies increase.    \n\u2022  An overall systematic  \u2022  Vertical and horizontal   \nInstitutional  process for functional  accountability is in balance \nResults  review is approved by the  with Councils recognizing \n  NCDD, including defining a  the rights of citizens  \nsystem which allows RGC \nto identify the preliminary \npermissive functions to be \ntransferred to SNAs.  \n\u2022  SNAs systems that \naccommodate the transfer of \nfunctions and subsequent \ntransfer of resources will be \ninstitutionalized  \n\u2022  SNAs implement a first \npackage of functions \ntransferred by national level \n \nBy the end of the 10-Year program period, the nature and extent of Council authority will have \nchanged substantially, and the nature of the relationship between Councils and agencies of the \ncentral state will have changed as well.

As functions are assigned to Councils, lines of accountability will shift, with greater \nexchange  and  stronger  relationships  occurring  between  Councils  and  Line  Ministries  than \nbetween Line Ministries and Line Offices.   \n \nAs functions are transferred, the role of ministries will be to create the enabling environment \nwithin which SNA Councils provide services that respond to the demands of citizens and meet \nthe goals and objectives of national government policies.  \n \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   20 ", "Chapter 2: Strategic Framework for Sub-National Democratic Development   \n2.8.

However, it will be necessary \nfor NCDD, Ministries and the Development Partners to take additional steps to adjust policies, \nstrategies and programs in order to ensure that sector reforms align with D&D reform. These are \noutlined as follows:  \n\u2022  Upon adoption of the National Program, the ministries formally require sector reform \nstrategies to account for and develop plans that assign or delegate functions in \naccordance with the NP.  \n\u2022  NCDD, through its sub-committees, will work with the Development Partners to \ndefine guiding principles for integration of sector reform programs and D&D reform.   \n\u2022  Development partners will work back through their respective country strategies and \nmap out key areas in which their respective sector programs and D&D programs will \nalign.  \n \n2.9.

PROGRAM AREA 1: SNA ORGANIZATION DEVELOPMENT \n \n3.1.1.  Rationale   \n \nTo create and promote sustainable democratic development at sub-national level, the RGC is \ncommitted  to  assign  roles  and  responsibilities  as  well  as  capacity  to  SNA  councils  in \ncoordinating all public administration activities [those of the SNA and the line ministries/ \noffices] in their jurisdiction. In this process, there is a need to re-structure SNA institutions \nbased on principles of unified administration having council as the SNA head in coordinating \npublic service provision and development in their jurisdiction and to promote accountability and \nresponsiveness  to  the  people.  To  support  this,  policy  and  guidelines  for  SNA  institution \nestablishment shall be developed based on these new lines of accountability, while the transfer \nof functions shall be determined on clear roles, functions, authority and resources to carry out \ntheir responsibility for coordinating the public administration activities in their territories.  The \nmore functions assigned to SNAs rather than delegated to SNAs, the greater discretion Councils \nhave over resources. \n \nThe creation of councils at capital, provincial, municipal and district and khan level significantly \nmodifies the lines of accountability for the existing administrations and changes the operating \nenvironment of the Commune and Sangkat councils. The establishment of the Councils requires a \nprogressive modification of the role of line ministries and their relationship with sub-national \nadministrations. Specifically, the line ministries will work more closely with the SNA councils as \nfunctions are transferred. The Technical Facilitation Committee serves as the primary coordinating \nvehicle for facilitating the work between these bodies of government at each SNA level. \n \nThe role and profile of each tier of SNAs will largely be defined by: (1) lines of accountability; \n(2)  revenue  sources  and  funding  mechanisms;  (3)  the  planning  process,  participation  and \ncitizen\u2019s rights; (4) methods of transferring functions and how those transferred functions are \nhandled;  (5)  degree  to  which  they  are  held  responsible  for  the  coordination  of  public \nadministrative activities within their territory.  \n \nThe interaction of these five elements will define the degree of autonomy of the SNA. Further, \nthe interaction will influence how Council\u2019s make decisions, the resources they have to allocate \nand their ability to be responsive to citizen.  Although Ministries do not have line units at \nCommune  and  Sangkat  level,  Communes  and  Sangkats  will  still  be  responsible  for  the \ncoordination of the public administration activities within their respective territories. They will \nmeet  this  responsibility  through  a  variety  of  means,  including:  participation  on  technical \nfacilitation committees of higher tier councils; and through the inclusion of Commune/Sangkat \nneeds in development plans of higher tier councils in the development planning process.   \n \nThe interaction of these five elements will be criteria used when establishing the operating and \nmanagement systems and procedures of the SNA.  Regardless of the specific role each tier of \nSNA assumes, a functioning administrative body is essential for them to address complex \nadministrative and political relationships, in particular ensuring that SNAs are accountable and \nresponsive to citizens, are result oriented and can efficiently deliver services.  \n \n \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   28 ", "Chapter 3: Program Areas   \nThe activities in Program Area 1 will build the capacity of each SNA to accommodate:  \n\u2022  Experimentation, piloting and review of new and adjusted lines of accountability; \n\u2022  The exercise of increased and more complex responsibility, in particular as it relates \nto delivering services, managing personnel, and making allocative decisions with \nregard to financial resources and assets;  \n\u2022  Working in coordination with other tiers of SNAs, line offices, CSOs and the private \nsector; \n\u2022  Defining their respective organizational mission, vision and goals, in particular as it \nrelates  to  integrating  women  and  women\u2019s  issues  and  climate  change  into \nmainstream administrative programs and service related activities.  \n \nActivities in the early years will focus on transitioning from the existing system and creating \nnew ones where none exist to support an initial transfer of functions together with corresponding \npersonnel and revenues.12 Operating procedures and management structures must be established, \nto  provide  the  organizational  infrastructure  necessary  for  Councils,  councils\u2019  committees, \nministry\u2019s line offices and civil society to work effectively together. This infrastructure will \nfacilitate both the relations among SNAs (intra-SNA relations) and the inter-governmental \nrelations necessary for coordinated delivery of services and for making cross sector planning and \nallocative decisions. \n \nAs the sub-national organizations evolve, activities are planned that incorporate the use of \ninformation technology as conditions in each SNA allow. As these structures, systems, and \nprocedures become increasingly functional, the focus of the program activities shifts to building \nthe capacity of SNAs to plot their own organization mission, strategies and development.  As \nprogram activities are implemented, SNAs will be able to focus on improving their performance \nwhich will subsequently improve the quality of services delivered. As the operating procedures \nand  management  systems  materialize,  the  SNAs  will  be  able  to  meet  the  standard  for \nPerformance and Accountability. \n \nProgram Area 1\u2019s objective is consistent with the Policy on Public Service Delivery adopted by \nthe Council for Administrative Reform.  Specifically Program Area 1 will allow the CAR \nmethodology which addresses the need to change work process from functional to operational, \nto be achieved at the sub-national level.  \n \n3.1.2.  Program Area Objective  \n \nProgram Area 1 objective is to create a functioning administration at the Commune, Sangkat, \nkhan, district, municipal, capital and provincial tiers of government that enables systematization \nof operating procedures and management practices necessary for transparent and accountable \ngovernance and service delivery by sub-national administrations. \n \n3.1.3.  Priorities \n \nThe organizational development of the SNAs creates the administrative and management space \nfor the integration of the human resources and financial management systems. \n \nThe  overall  program  requirements  for  each  Platform  are  defined  in  Table  3.1  Logical \nFramework, however, priority should be given to the following:  \n \n                                                            \n12 An analysis of functions and its transfer procedures will be developed in the first semester of 2010  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   29 ", "Chapter 3: Program Areas   \nA).  Priorities at Commune/Sangkat Level \n \nPlatform 1:  Critical to the continued development within Communes and Sangkats will be the \ncreation of the legally required support units at municipal and district level as defined in the Law \non the Administrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts  and \nKhans. It will be necessary to define the difference in the support required for the Communes \nand for the Sangkats in districts versus the Sangkats that are part of the administrative territory \nof the Municipalities or Khans. Inherent in developing the support units is the transfer of \nresponsibilities of the Provincial Technical Support Units and support deemed necessary by the \nprovincial SNAs to the District and Municipal administrations. \n \nIt will also be a priority to develop and transfer a first package of functions to Commune \ncouncils. Functions  may be selected from among functions already being implemented by \nCommune councils, but should not necessarily be limited to those functions. \n \nPlatform 2:  It is anticipated that Communes and Sangkats will be recipients of transfer of some \nfunctions. However, due to limited administrative capacity and in consideration of economies of \nscale, it will be necessary to develop a sound intra-SNA and/or inter-governmental system of \nservice  delivery  that  is  rule-based,  includes  strong  mechanisms  for  accountability  for \nperformance of higher tier SNAs and utilizes various service delivery mechanisms such as \ncontracts with private firms or service agreements with district/municipal administrations or \nMinistry line offices to ensure ongoing delivery of services. \n \nB).  Priorities at Municipal/District/Khan Level \n \nPlatform  1:  The  district  and  municipal  administrations  have  the  least  administrative \ninfrastructure.  It will be critical in Platform One to address these limits in order to accommodate \nthe  transfer  of  finances  and  personnel  which  correspond  with  the  eventual  assignment  of \nfunctions,  including  the  responsibility  for  direct  service  provision.  In  the  short  term,  the \nadministrative systems required should ensure that Councils can  identify and  plan for the \ndevelopment  of  their  territories  and  make  allocative  decisions  that  reflect  hard  budget \nconstraints.  The development plans must reflect the Commune and Sangkat integrated plans as \nwell as resources required to implement services for municipal, district and khan. \n \nIt will also be a priority outcome to develop and transfer a first package of functions for district \nand  municipal  councils.    Functions  may  be  selected  from  among  functions  already  being \nimplemented at those levels (such as functions related to One-Window Service and the District \nInitiative project), but should not necessarily be limited to those functions.  \n \nPlatform 2:  As the basic administrative systems for districts, municipalities and khan are \noperationalized, the Councils and staff should develop medium term organizational development \nplans that define the council\u2019s needs in preparing to receive the transfer of new functions. \n \nC).  Priorities at Capital/Provincial Level  \n \nPlatform 1:  The focus of the immediate program support required by provinces and in Phnom \nPenh is the preparation of organizational development that defines the actions necessary to \nmerge systems and personnel and a strategy for the development of the organizations\u2019 systems \nand procedures in line with functions currently carried out by capital and provincial governors. \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   30 ", "Chapter 3: Program Areas   \nIt will also be a priority to develop and transfer a first package of functions to the Capital and \nprovincial  councils.  Functions  may  be  selected  from  among  functions  already  being \nimplemented at the Capital and provincial levels, but should not necessarily be limited to those \nfunctions.    \n \nPlatform 2: Capital and provinces in particular will assume a greater role of coordinating \nprovincial  wide  development  demands.  Instituting  inclusive  development  processes  and \nimplementation plans which integrate regional needs with national policy will be required.  \nPhnom Penh should focus on reviewing and adjusting its existing development strategy. First, it \nwill need to focus on aligning the city\u2019s own organization as well as that of its constituent Khans \nand Sangkats in order to establish a new basis for the intra-SNA relations of Phnom Penh with \nits respective Khans and Sangkats.

PROGRAM AREA 2: HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND \nDEVELOPMENT SYSTEMS  \n \n3.2.1.  Rationale \n \nThis program area addresses both the management and development of human resources in \nSNAs to support the institutionalization process as described in the Program Area 1.  To meet \nthe Program Area objective, program activities are defined to address three aspects: (1) the \nprogressive transfer of existing personnel from ministries to SNAs in accordance with the \ntransfer of functions and resources; (2) creation of the SNA policies, procedures and programs to \nmanage the personnel; and (3) capacity and programs necessary for SNAs to develop their \nhuman  resources.  These  activities  follow  from  the  policy  commitment  that  SNAs  will \nincreasingly exercise control over their personnel.    \n \nThe management and development of the SNA human resources is critical to the delivery of \nservices and democratic development. HR management systems reinforce a rules based civil \nservice in which the staffing levels and assignment of personnel is transparent, merit based \nemployment practices are carried out, and performance based promotion and disciplinary actions \nare utilized. This changes the incentives for civil servants, in time shifting their purpose from \none of carrying out tasks to one of effective provider of public services.   \n \nConcurrent with the institutionalization of new human resource management practices is the \nneed for identifying and creating HR development programs that build the professionalism of \ncivil  servants.  Strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  HR  personnel  to  create  human  resource \ndevelopment   will allow for capacity development programs to become demand driven.  It is \nexpected by Platform 2, that the HR offices of SNAs will be part of the institutional arrangement \nthat defines the on going capacity development requirements for the NP.    \n \n3.2.2.  Program Area Objective \n \nThe Program Area 2 objective is to institute highly motivated and professional civil service in \nsub-national administrations that is accountable to and managed by the Council.  \n \n3.2.3.  Priorities \n \nA).  Platform 1: Establish Legal Base for SNA Civil Service and HR Management  \n \nIn  the  initial  years,  program  activities  are  designed  to  establish  the  basic  operating  and \nmanagement procedures that facilitate the transfer of employees as functions are delegated or \nassigned and allow Councils to exercise oversight of employee performance and pay.  To \nfacilitate increasing control of civil service by Councils it will be necessary to put the legal \nframework in place. \n \nB).  Platform 2: Create the capacity of SNAs to manage and develop human resources  \n \nIn successive years, program activities will build the capacity of human resource units within the \nSNAs in order for them to facilitate the capacity development and take on more complex Human \nResource Management (HRM) responsibilities.     \n \n3.2.4.

PROGRAM AREA 3: TRANSFER OF FUNCTIONS  \n \n3.3.1.  Rationale \n \nThere  are  two  dimensions  incorporated  in  the  comprehensive  program  for  the  transfer  of \nfunctions.  The first dimension is the process by which the transfer of functions occurs and the \nsecond  dimension  reflects  institutional  requirements  necessary  to  promote  continual \nimprovement of the quality of the services that reflect the responsibility of the SNA through the \ntransfer of the function. In regard to the first dimension, an overall systematic process for \nfunctional review, approved by the NCDD, will be required that is based on government policy \nregarding state functional architecture and a common methodology for all Ministries to use, with \nopportunities for cross-learning among Ministries.  The development of this overall process for \nfunctional review will not preclude the development and transfer in 2010 of a first package of \nfunctions to each level of council.   \n \nExecuting the necessary action with regard to the transfer of functions and institutionalizing an \nongoing improvement of services will require coordination with sector strategies for service \nimprovements.  Coordination will be carried out through the work of the NCDD Sub-committee \non Functions and Resources involve the D&D working groups and be supported by the Inter-\nministerial Division of the NCDD Secretariat.  Further, representative from the National League \nfor Communes  and Sangkats will hold seats on the NCDD Sub-committee Functions  and \nResources, and thus will be able to advocate for the SNAs. Improvement of services must also \nbe a bottom-up process and, therefore, strong mechanisms of accountability must be in place \nthat citizens, civil society and Commune/Sangkat councils can utilize to demand improved \nperformance in service provision. \n \nA).  Transfer of Functions \n \nA function is a government activity that addresses a community need through sustained actions \nthat provide a benefit in the community over time. Further, the transfer of a function carries with \nit, and therefore must include the transfer of: \n\u2022  the responsibility by law to identify and address unmet needs and risks or dangers \nrelated to the function, and \n\u2022  the right by law to control, command, or determine activities as necessary to meet \nthat  responsibility,  with    activities  covering  a  range  of  issues  including  the \nestablishment  of  policy,  defining  and  implementing  a  program  and  providing  a \nservice.  \n \nThe transfers will be made to each tier of sub-national administration as per the principles set \nout in Article 220 of the Law on the Administrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, \nMunicipalities,  Districts  and  Khans  and  Article  44  of  the  Law  on  the  Administration  of \nCommunes and Sangkats, the Strategic Framework for D&D Reform 2005 and the National \nStrategic Development Plan. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that principles of functional \ntransfer do not prevent the transfer of functions to Commune and Sangkats.   \n \nThe Transfer of functions will  impact greatly on SNA operations  as already described in \nProgram Area 1. A basis for developing functional transfer policy, critical and in-depth analysis \nis  required  as  different  levels  of  administrations  face  different  conditions  that  must  be \nconsidered \u2013 i.e., proximity to citizens, economies of scale, allocative efficiency and cross \nboarder externalities.  \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   38 ", "Chapter 3: Program Areas   \nPast experiences show that internationally, functions are more often deconcentrated (rather than \ndecentralized) where the impacts affect more than one province (water or air quality); the \nsolution is innovative and/or untested; or the solutions are unknown and efficiency is the key \nfactor.  However,  functions  can  or  would    be  decentralized  where  issues  of  sub-national \nimportance predominate (urban growth management or potable water supply); some variation \nand diversity in response is acceptable; the impacts are reasonably localized (local access road); \na solution is tested; and responsiveness is as or more important than efficiency. \n \nThe functional review process must be systematized, reasonable and sustainable and must be \ngrounded in the rule of law. An overall systematic process for functional review is required that \nis  based  on  government  policy  regarding  state  functional  architecture  and  a  common \nmethodology  to  be  used  by  all  Ministries,  with  opportunities  for  cross-learning  among \nMinistries.  The actual transfer of functions shall be aligned with: \n\u2022  the establishment of the SNA governing structure (PA1), \n\u2022  the transfer of personnel and development of personnel management systems (PA2), \nand \n\u2022  the transfer of financial resources and establishment of budget and asset management \nsystems (PA4). \n \nFurther, it requires that ministries adjust their missions, organizations and procedures to reflect \nthe transfer of responsibility and resources to SNAs. It will be necessary to ensure that these \nactions occur in a consistent, coordinated and consultative manner. Further, they must be carried \nout with the proper technical analysis.  The actual transfers must align with the annual budget \ncycle  so  that  financial  resources  can  be  appropriated  to  the  recipient  SNA  budget.    The \nregulations drafted for each of the actual transfers will specify the tier to which the function and \nsub-functions are transferred.   Preparation of the regulations should be part of the legal action \nplan that will be prepared by NCDD per Program Area 5. \n \nB).  Service Improvement Programs  \n \nTransferring of functions brings the decisions about the quality, access and quantity of services \ncloser to the people and as such, establishes the structural foundation for more effective use of \nresources.  Transferring  of  functions  in  and  of  themselves  is  not  sufficient  for  ongoing \nimprovement of service delivery.  It will be necessary for the SNAs to develop mechanisms and \nprograms that lead to ongoing improvements in services.  Programs and mechanisms that are \nconducive to improving services are many. Mechanisms include working with NGOs and civil \nsociety organizations in jointly providing services, contracting with private firms for service \nprovision and negotiating agreements with other administrative bodies. Decisions with regard to \nthe  quality  and  quantity  must  reflect  the  expectations  of  the  citizens  through  transparent \nparticipation process. Mechanisms of accountability for citizens and Commune/Sangkat councils \nthat incorporate sanctions for poor performance of SNAs in service delivery, therefore, will be \ncritical. \n \nThe degree to which Councils can take action and be held responsible for the quality of services \nwill correspond to the way in which functions are transferred.  Delegated functions will require \nCouncils to work in closer cooperation with line offices of ministries that are involved in the \nsector. Functions that are assigned place the largest share of the responsibility on the Council \nand the SNA itself.  \n \n \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   39 ", "Chapter 3: Program Areas   \n3.3.2.  Program Area Objective \n \nProgram Area 3 objective is to promote the delivery level and quality of public services through \nthe transfer of functions corresponding with responsibility, authority and resources to carry out \nthose functions.  \n \n3.3.3.  Priorities \n \nA).  Platform 1  \n \nA-1).  Developing policy regarding state functional architecture  \n \nUltimately a strategic decision is required with regard to state functional architecture (the role / \npurpose of each tier of SNA) vis-\u00e0-vis the effective delivery of a service and in accordance with \nthe principle of subsidiarity for transfer of functions as stated in the Organic Laws, the D&D \nStrategic Framework and NSDP.  This decision shall be made by RGC informed by the NCDD.  \nA basis for this policy is set out in Section 1.2 of Chapter 1. The Ministries of Planning and \nMEF in their roles as advisers on the use of budget resources shall be involved in accordance \nwith clear development visions.  Mechanisms need to be put in place to review, analyze and \ndetermine which functions could be transferred to which level of SNAs. The need to develop \nthis policy should also not preclude the transfer of a first set of functions to each level of \ncouncil.  \n \nA-1).  Develop and transfer a first package of functions to each level of council \n \nExperience and learning will be captured from functions that have already been implemented at \nsub-national levels, including Commune/Sangkat level.  The information gathered will inform \nthe development of a first package of basic functions for each level of council to be transferred, \nenabling SNAs to learn by doing in the new democratic and accountability environment. \n \nA-3).  Ensure  that  the  transfer  of  functions  including  the  transfer  of  corresponding \nresponsibility,  authority  and  resources,  is  undertaken  in  partnership  with  line \nministries, that the transfer of functions is completed in accordance with an overall \nsystematic approach and in a timely manner  \n \nThe functional review process would be a joint exercise of concerned ministries and entities, \nNCDD/Sub-committee on Functions and Resources, member ministries through D&D working \ngroups, and NCDD support mechanisms. Functions being analyzed for the transfer have to be \ndefined as obligatory or permissive. An overall systematic process for functional review will be \ndesigned and approved by the NCDD, that is based on government policy regarding state \nfunctional architecture and a common methodology for use by all Ministries, with opportunities \nfor cross-learning among Ministries.  The need to develop this policy will take into account the \ntransfer of a first set of functions to each level of council. \n \nFunctions that are transferred as part of the first packages of functions and functions that have \nbeen proposed to be transferred in Platform 1 would meet the criteria as shown in the list below: \n\u2022  Current delegated functions of province/district governors, including those associated \nwith pilots (i.e. One-Window Service and District Initiative project) \n\u2022  There are easily identifiable financial resources and/or fees / other dedicated funds \nbeing collected to implement the functions \n\u2022  It is easy to identify the personnel to be transferred \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   40 ", "Chapter 3: Program Areas   \n\u2022  There is minimal technical complexity required to perform the functions \n\u2022  High local priorities from citizens  \n\u2022  Demand from sub-national administrations \n\u2022  Special attention must be paid to functions related to climate risk management. \n \nA-4).  Ongoing support to ministries  \n \nAs progress is made, program activities also must address the changing role and relationship line \nministries will have with the SNAs.  The transfer of functions requires that ministries\u2019 roles and \nrelations must be adjusted.  Ministries become a part of the enabling environment in support of \nSNAs which may require amendments to ministerial legislation.    \n \nB).  Platform 2    \n \nB-1).  Ongoing review and continual action of transfer process \n \nOver time it will be necessary to monitor the transfer of functions and consider the changing \ndemographic  and  migration  patterns  which  affect  the  demand  for  services  in  the  capital, \nprovinces, districts, municipalities, khans, Communes and Sangkats.    \n \nB-2).  Develop continual service improvement programs within SNAs  \n \nThe transfer of functions must be accompanied by steps taken by councils that ensure the \nongoing improvement of service delivery.  Service improvement involves making decisions \nabout the assignment of personnel and the allocation of resources for operation, maintenance \nand capital needs related to a specific service. Service improvement programs should be a part \nof the 3-year development programs and must be reflected in the annual operating and capital \nbudgets of the SNA. Improvement of services must also be a bottom-up process and, therefore, \nstrong  mechanisms  of  accountability  must  be  put  in  place  that  citizens,  civil  society  and \nCommune/Sangkat councils can utilize to demand improved performance in service provision. \n \n3.3.4.

PROGRAM AREA 4:  SUB-NATIONAL BUDGET, FINANCIAL AND \nPROPERTY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS \n \n3.4.1.  Rationale \n \nSub-national budget, finance and property is a complex multi-faceted area, in which SNA \nsystems will need to respect existing public finance system rules while at the same time ensuring \nan  evolution/application  of  these  rules  consistent  with  the  Law  on  the  Administrative \nManagement of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans and forthcoming \nLaw on Financial Regime and State Property Management for SNAs. This program area is fully \nlinked with the Objective 27 of the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP). \nAs indicated in the Log Frame for Program Area 4, a key assumption is that the Law on \nFinancial Regime and State Property Management for SNAs will be adopted during 2010; if this \ndoes not prove to be the case, it will be urgent and imperative to address key budget, treasury \nand accounting processes as well as unconditional and conditional transfer rules via temporary \ndecrees or other appropriate regulations. \n \nProgram Area Context: Implementation of Program Area 4 cannot be successful if the other \nProgram Areas are not also successful. Accountable financial management involving greater \ndecision-making authorities by SNAs requires qualified and motivated personnel. Additional \nfinancial resources and discretion over them will not serve their intended purpose if significant \nfunctions,  with  associated  responsibility,  authority  and  accountability  have  not  also  been \ntransferred to them.  Finally, mechanisms for downward accountability must be sufficiently \nrobust to ensure that SNAs serve as good stewards and managers of public financial resources in \naddressing the expressed needs of citizens. \n \nThe PFMRP was launched in 2005 based on the RGC observation that \n\u201c\u2026effective and efficient public financial management is the necessary core foundation \nfor country development and poverty reduction of the people especially through ensuring \nsustainable economic growth and improving efficiency of public services\u201d. \n \nStage 2 of PFMRP Platform 2 is building on the new-found budget credibility in order to \nachieve better financial accountability. This goal implies that all actors responsible for using \nbudget resources should be involved in the PFM reform, not just MEF, but also the line \nMinistries and the sub-national administrations. \n \nObjective 27 of the PFMRP is to strengthen and develop fiscal decentralization policy and \nstrategy; it was elaborated prior to adoption of the Law. The implementation plan for program \narea 4 of the NP-SNDD incorporates the need to review and adapt Objective 27 and incorporate \nits key activities in the NP-SNDD. \n \nAt the same time PFMRP Stage 2 Platform 2 objectives which are under the purview of other \nkey departments will ultimately require some adaptation in their activities in order to fully \nestablish and strengthen a sub-national financial, budget and asset management regime. Key \nMEF departments where PFMRP will intersect with the NP-SNDD include: Treasury, Budget \nDepartment,  Department  of  Investment  and  Cooperation,  Procurement  Department,  State \nProperty Department, General Department of Taxation; Non-Tax Revenue Department. These \nactions will be defined in line with the forthcoming Draft Law on Financial Regime and State \nProperty Management for Sub-national Administrations and its various implementing legal \ninstruments, decrees and guidelines. \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   46 ", "Chapter 3: Program Areas   \nIn terms of sector reforms and management, the line Ministries will simultaneously be: \n\u2022  building on greater budget predictability to develop internal resource management \nmechanisms implying greater visibility and transparency and, \n\u2022  transferring functions to sub-national administration.  \n \nThus the alignment of D&D and PFM reform programs will need to be articulated not only \nbetween MoI and MEF through the NCDD, but also within each line Ministry as functions are \ntransferred to sub-national administrations.  \n \nAccountability is a key underlying theme of Program Area 4. Internal accountability is to be \nensured via internal audit operations, and most significantly, via the relations and processes \nbetween council and BoG/Administration in respect to budget implementation. Accountability at \nthe intra-SNA level is of particular interest in respect to the sharing of specified revenues \nbetween  districts  and  the  Communes/Sangkats  within  the  district.  Inter-governmental \naccountability in exercised through MEF financial inspections and NAA audits of SNA financial \nperformance. Finally, accountability to citizens is established in respect to budget development, \nchoices, and implementation; as well as via public hearings related to budget, investment, and \ndevelopment issues.  \n \n3.4.2.  Program Area Objective \n \nProgram Area 4 objective is to establish and institutionalize a functioning, coherent system to \nenable  SNAs to  obtain/raise  adequate  resources  over which they  have  varying  degrees  of \ndiscretion; to allocate these funds in a transparent and accountable manner \n \n3.4.3.  Priorities \n \nA).  Platform 1   \n \nA key prerequisite which underlies each priority outcome and output for the short-term is the \nadoption of the Law on Financial Regime and State Property Management for SNAs. Should \nthis law not be adopted by end 2010, interim budget, finance, accounting and property policies \nwill need to be developed. Should that be the case, it will be important that these be developed \nand acted on as purely transitional expedients. The goal should be to adopt and put into place the \nnecessary  legislation,  as  mandated  by  the  Law  on  the  Administrative  Management  of  the \nCapital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans, as quickly as is feasible. \n \nA-1).  Establish basic budget development, adoption, implementation and reporting \nsystems \n \nAlthough the functional transfers will be an ongoing process, it will be critical to establish as \nearly  as  possible  the  budget  formats,  preparation  and  adoption  procedures  and  budget \nimplementation systems, linked with accounting and cash management, in order for SNAs to \nadequately carry out their new functions and provide the services expected of them. Although, \nas is anticipated, these systems shall be consistent with national public finance procedures, they \nshall also mirror new approaches as established under PFMRP reforms and reflect the specific \nconditions / situation of SNA operations and management. In the first period, greatest focus \nshould be placed on the districts and the municipalities. \n \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   47 ", "Chapter 3: Program Areas   \nA-2).  Ensure that key personnel to carry out appropriate budget, cash management and \nprocurement processes are in place and trained.     \n \nSNAs  cannot  carry  ensure  their  budget,  finance  and  accounting  needs  and responsibilities \nwithout adequate staff with requisite skills and training. Therefore, considerable attention should \nbe paid and support given by the relevant departments of MEF and MOI to each Council to \nsecure the appointment of a qualified chief of finance for each SNA, as well as sub-provincial \naccountants. Support for basic professional training as well as capacity development related to \nnew budget and accounting systems and procedures as they are developed will be essential. \nSNAs should seek to benefit from the accounting training program being developed under Stage \n2 of the PFMRP. \n \nA-3).  Lay down the framework for a stable, predictable, and transparent revenue system  \n \nIn the first period of the National Program implementation, attention shall be given to (i) the \ndevelopment of systematic procedures for identification/calculation of resources associated with \nthe transfer of functions, in order to establish transparent formulas with objective criteria; (ii) \ndevelopment of unconditional transfers for Capital/Provinces and Districts/Municipalities, which \nshould acknowledge socio-economic characteristics; (iii) identification of non-tax charges and \nfees associated with transferred functions. \n \nInitial work begins with the development of policy on the own-source tax revenues of SNAs, \nincluding those which are to become the object of transfers from the Districts to their constituent \nCommunes and Sangkats.  At the same time, there is a need to clarify goals and principles with \nrespect to downward accountability for public spending and budget management. \n \nA-4).  Ensure a smooth asset transfer process  \n \nEffective implementation of the SNAs functions subsequent to their transfer requires that the \nassociated assets be transferred, along with adequate revenues to operate and maintain those \nassets. The Law on the Administrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, \nDistricts and Khans provides considerable detail as to the procedures for the transfers of assets \nto SNAs, it will be the responsibility of the NCDD to ensure that these procedures are followed \nby the respective line Ministries.  \n \nB).  Platform 2     \n \nB-1).  Ongoing review and continual support for basic budget, accounting and cash \nmanagement processes.  \n \nGiven  the  considerable  challenge  of  setting  up  SNA  appropriate  and  adequate  budget, \naccounting, financial and cash management systems and reviewing the chart of accounts for \nCommunes/Sangkats,  periodic  policy  and  action  review  should  be  conducted  in  order  to \ndetermine: (i) potential problems such as: rules or their interpretation; (ii) gaps in developing \nsystems or procedures; (iii) weaknesses due to management or implementation capacity. Based \non the findings, corrective actions should be engaged, such as modification of relevant policies, \nor additional/targeted training of SNA officials. \n \n \n \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   48 ", "Chapter 3: Program Areas   \nB-2).  Increase discretion margins of SNAs in line with function transfers and improved \nSNA management capacities \n \nIn the medium-term period, the overall outline of the SNA revenue system should be further \ndrawn so that: (i) sector conditional transfers can be merged; (ii) some conditional transfers be \nconsidered for conversion to unconditional transfers; (iii) SNA discretion for establishing rates \nof own non-tax fees and charges be instituted; (iv) provision for analyzing SNA\u2019s discretion in \nsetting rates of own tax revenues within ranges of rates set by the national level.  \n \nB-3).  Ongoing review and support to SNA asset management systems and capacities \n \nOnce the bulk of key functions have been transferred or identified for transfer and associated \nassets also transferred, attention must be given to the timely and accurate inventory of SNA \nassets and their efficient management. The development of these systems will also have to \naccount for those assets which were built / created/mobilized/acquired by SNAs themselves. \nConsideration should also be given to the review of rules on how assets are used, their use \nmodified.  \n \nB-4).  Development of internal and external audit and accountability systems \n \nLegal, administrative and political accountability of SNAs for the management of their finances \nwill be one of the key points on which the success or failure of the D&D reform will be judged. \nThe strong pillar of adequate and functioning budget, financial management and accounting \nsystems are a pre-requisite. Subsequently, attention can be turned to establishing the internal \naudit systems/procedures and staff of SNAs and to ensuring that adequate / appropriate audit \ncapability exists both in the National Audit Authority and the relevant departments of the MEF.  \nExperimentation with the use of social audits, public expenditure tracking and budget debates in \npilot projects to evaluate their utility as a means of downward accountability for public financial \nmanagement. \n \n3.4.4.

PROGRAM AREA 5:  SUPPORT INSTITUTIONS FOR D&D REFORM    \n \n3.5.1.  Rationale \n \nThe complexity of the reform envisaged in the 10-Year Program for SNDD will place new \ndemands  on  national  level  government  and  non-government  institutions.  This  will  require \ndeveloping the capacity of existing institutions to carry out the policies, visions and programs \narticulated in the NP-SNDD.  The institutional support for D&D is not static, however. It is not \nsufficient to provide support only during the process of transfer of responsibility, authority and \nresources.  Rather, it is necessary to have strong institutions that work with SNAs on an ongoing \nbasis. Therefore, Program Area 5 activities support the transition of national institutions as well \nas  address  gaps  in  institutional  arrangements  necessary  to  address  the  new  lines  of \naccountability. As progress is made in building the capacity of the support institutions it is \nenvisioned that they will assume an increasing role in the delivery of programs and technical \nassistance to build the capacity of individuals and the SNAs.  \n \nAt a minimum, support institutions must be able to provide the following:  \n \nA).  Policy Enactment and Legal Framework  \n \nSub-national democratic development will be defined by the adoption and implementation of \nD&D policy and legal instruments that:  \n\u2022  Establish new governance institutions, structures and systems at SNA \n\u2022  Transfer  functions,  local  finances  and  assets,  and  personnel  necessary  for  the \nformation of viable SNAs with significant pro-poor service responsibilities and the \ncorresponding discretionary authority and resources; and, \n\u2022  Achieve  full  and  effective  accountability  of  SNAs,  with  emphasis  on  the \naccountability of elected sub-national councils to citizens. \n \nRoyal decree No. NS/RKT/1208/1429 has given the NCDD the mandate to coordinate and lead \nthe implementation of the Law on the Administrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, \nMunicipalities, Districts and Khans, the Law on Administrative Management of Communes/ \nSangkats and the implementation of policy on decentralization and deconcentration reforms.   \n \nAs  an  institution,  NCDD  itself  will  be  required  to  coordinate  the  drafting  and  review  of  \nappropriate legal instruments and operational procedures of ministries and institutions of the \nRoyal Government relating to management, distribution of responsibility and the transfer of \nresources to capital, province, municipal, district, khan and C/S.  Particular emphasis must be \ngiven to coordinating the legal reform necessary to support the transfer of functions.  \n \nB).  Ministerial Oversight and Regulatory Support \n \nThe implications of the reform on the central level will be in reference to the changes at the \nSNA level, the principle factors being the establishment of unified administrations and the \ntransfer of functions.  As functions are transferred, the role of central level ministries and \nagencies play in the four aspects of state management - regulatory, administrative, investment \nand delivery of services - will be altered. Further, ministries will accommodate inputs from \ncitizens communicated upward through the SNA. The mechanism for this is the principle of \nunified administration, for which the SNAs are assigned the responsibility for coordinating the \nactivities within their territories. This mechanism creates an indirect line of accountability \nbetween the citizens and the ministries via the Councils and the Board of Governors.  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   55 ", "Chapter 3: Program Areas   \nAs a result, in central level ministries: \n\u2022  Management duties and responsibilities will change as functions are transferred. \nThey must take on an oversight and monitoring role, transferring to the SNAs the \nauthority to manage resources and to define the approaches to achieving results. For \nexample, in this capacity, ministries would ensure that the functions carried out by \nSNAs are in compliance with national standards.  \n\u2022  Strategies and programs must incorporate inputs received via the SNA as they carry \nout their responsibility for coordinating all public administration activities in their \nterritories and receive input from citizens on services and programs needed in their \nterritory.  \n \nC).  Conflict Resolution   \n \nThe Law on the Administrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts \nand Khans, and the Law on the Administrative Management of Commune/Sangkat establish a \nmanagement system that requires coordination and cooperation among SNAs and between \nSNAs and line ministries and line ministry offices. It is expected that conflicts will arise for \nwhich it is necessary to have a clear and objective resolution process by which to resolve the \nconflicts.    \n \nD).  Monitoring and Evaluation of NP  \n \nThe NCDD is committed to implementing a successful M&E system that measures the impact \nand  implementation  (including  capacity  development)  of  RGC  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration reform. To accomplish this it will be necessary to provide technical support to \nmanagers  and  professional  staff  about  how  to  undertake  performance  measurement  (the \ntechnical side) and how to use the information obtained. \n \nE).  Capacity Development \n \nThere will be an ongoing demand by SNA and other institutions for technical support and \nlearning opportunities that allows individuals and institutions to achieve the results envisaged \nfrom sub-national democratic development.  \nSpecific attention must be given to:  \n\u2022  Building a cadre of young professionals who will enter the civil service for positions \nthat are newly created or open due to retirements at both the SNA and ministry level;  \n\u2022  Ensuring that officials have the core competencies to carry out their responsibilities; \n\u2022  Ensuring that SNA officials have the right attitudes and behaviors in line with SNA \nnew lines of accountability towards their citizens;   \n\u2022  Preparing a new generation of elected officials;    \n\u2022  Citizens interested in governance process and local development or newly elected to \nCouncils at all levels of SNAs;  \n\u2022  Mainstreaming gender issues and the promotion of women in Council and the civil \nservice. \n \nThis will require that a mix of different types of institutions (public and private) be engaged in \nmeeting these demands.  Academic institutions, specifically schools of public administration, \nmust develop a curriculum to address the governing environment at the sub-national level.  The \nprofessional and vocational training programs of existing government agencies, in particular the \nGeneral Department of Local Administration, will be assessed to determine if and how they can \nbe reoriented to meet the future demands of local officials.  Ministry level capacity development \nprograms  will  not  be  sufficient.  It  will  also  be  necessary  to  work  with  non-government \norganizations and private companies to meet the voluminous demands for capacity development.   \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   56 ", "Chapter 3: Program Areas   \nIn addition to determining the capacity of the existing institutions to meet the demand, it will \nalso be necessary to introduce new approaches to knowledge transfer.  Two strategic approaches \nwill be utilized to accomplish this requirement. One will be to introduce the experiential learning \nmodels. How this will be built into capacity development programs is fully presented in the \nCapacity  Development  Plan.  Two,  it  will  be  necessary  to  capture  the  lessons  learned. \nStakeholders  in  the  D&D  must  have  access  materials  and  documents  that  codifying  the \nexperiences reform.  This can be done by creating a knowledge management system, however, \nthis system must be anchored in the demand for knowledge by various stakeholders.  To that end \nit will be necessary to determine:  \n1). Who wants the knowledge and for what purpose?  SNAs, Ministries, NCDD, DPs, \nNGOs, CSOs. To inform policy at the national level, by SNAs to develop creative \nways to carry-out their functions, etc? \n2). How will the knowledge generated? (e.g. DP reports and assessments, NCDD policy \nteam assessments, CSO analysis),  \n3). How will it be archived?   \n4). What, if any, legal or contractual requirements will there be to use the knowledge?   \n \nF).  Policy Support  \n \nIndependent  leagues  and  associations  of  sub-national  administrations  such  as  the  National \nLeague of Communes and Sangkats (NLC/S) and the Provincial Associations of Communes and \nSangkats  (PAC/S)  are  important  voices  of  SNAs  and  must  be  supported  with  the  aim  to \narticulate  and  advocate  the  common  interests  of  SNAs,  enhance  their  participation  in  the \nformulation of Government policies, and define and address their capacity development needs.   \n \n3.5.2.  Program Area Objective \n \nProgram Area 5 objective is to strengthen national institutions that will guide the implementation \nof the 10 Year Program and support SNAs.  \n \n3.5.3.  Priorities  \n \nA).  Platform 1  \n \nA-1).  NCDD Sub-Committees develop annual work plans in line with NP-SNDD  \n \nThe NCDD Sub-Committees are an inter-ministerial thematic mechanism having the primary \nmandate to coordinate with PFMRP and NPAR and to work with concerned ministries to \ndevelop/review  legal  and  regulatory  instruments  prior  to  NCDD  decisions.  NCDD  Sub-\nCommittees must develop and operationalize their annual work plans in support of the NP-\nSNDD. Work plans shall include a description of the technical assistance that is required to \ncarry out activities related to their mandate.  \n \nA-2).  Ministries with responsibility for transfer of candidate functions prepare strategies.  \n \nImmediate support shall be given to the ministries who will be transferring functions, staff and \nfinancial resources to SNAs. The NCDD Secretariat, therefore, will ensure consistent technical \nsupport  regarding  functional  review  across  Ministries.  The  support  will  be  provided  in \nconjunction with MEF and CAR. The work will be carried out in accordance with an action plan \nfocused on supporting the D&D working groups as the first audience to whom support is given; \nand the support shall include a review and adjustment of the regulations and guidelines that \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   57 ", "Chapter 3: Program Areas   \nshould be amended to reflect the new roles and responsibilities of ministry departments, offices \nand units. This NCDD Secretariat would also ensure that there are cross-learning opportunities \namong Ministries.  \n \nA-3).  Develop the action plan to build capacity of Cambodian education and training \ninstitutions\u2019 ability to support D&D reform.  \n \nInstitutionalization of the overall D&D reform requires a shift in the pedagogical base of education \nand training curriculum. An immediate first step is to define the necessary pedagogical bases and \nassess existing institutional capacity to incorporate the base into curriculum.  \n \nA-4).  National League of Commune and Sangkat must adjust to new sub-national \nadministrative landscape \n \nThe National League of C/S will be required to assess its existing mandates and capacity.  The \nassessment  must  address  the  requirements  and  the  institutional  arrangements  that  reflect \ngovernment  policy  on  state  functional  architecture.    The  assessment  must  also  focus  on \ncapacities and mechanisms needed in order to hold higher tier SNAs accountable for their \nperformance.  Inherent  in  the  assessment  is  the  requirement  to  consider  how  to  retain  the \nindependence of the National League of C/S and any other SNA advocacy institution.  \n \nB).  Platform 2   \n \nB-1).  Continual development of the enabling environment in support of D&D reform \n \nThroughout  the  10-year  NP  the  NCDD  will  require  assistance  in  creating  the  enabling \nenvironment based on the adoption of necessary legal instruments and development of systems \nand programs. \n \nB-2).  Cambodian education intuitions assume greater responsibility in implementing the \nNP-SNDD capacity development plan \n \nA strategy will be put in place that transfers the responsibility for implementing the NP-SNDD \ncapacity building plan to Cambodian institutions in developing capacity on local administration. \nThis necessitates the institutionalization of the experiential learning process from which the \nresults of the capacity development programs inform the ongoing requirements for change \nessential to achieve the results expected.  An institutional assessment will be completed and a \nprogram for development of institutional capacity will be executed that reflects the outputs in \nPA 5 log frame and the NP-SNDD Capacity Development plan.  \n \nB-3).  Develop the full range of National League support to SNA \n \nAs the support to build functioning SNAs is more fully realized it will be essential to create the \nnecessary institutions that address the legal and operating mandates of SNA. Consideration must \nbe made of ways in which these institutions could raise the stature of SNA councils and build \nthe professionalism and raise the stature of SNA civil service.  \n \n3.5.4.

NP-SNDD MANAGEMENT ARRANGEMENT \n \nThe NP-SNDD as the Government\u2019s program to implement D&D reform will achieve results \nthrough (1) policy (such as the legal instruments to implement the Law on the Administrative \nManagement of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans, the Law on the \nAdministrative Management of Commune/Sangkat); (2) institutions (structures and systems at \nboth national and sub-national levels); and (3) improved services (via investments in economic \nand social infrastructure and management systems). Implementation of the NP-SNDD will have \nimpacts across most of the Government\u2019s ministries and agencies at the national level, and \nacross all units and institutions at sub-national levels. In this regard, management of the NP-\nSNDD requires both political and technical mechanisms inclusive of national and sub-national \nrepresentation.  These NP-SNDD management arrangements shall be able to handle all matters \nrelated to the D&D reform, and specifically D&D policy direction, NP-SNDD implementation \nmanagement, and SNDD program coordination. \n \n4.1.1.  D&D Policy Direction \n \nThe success of D&D reform heavily depends on high-level government commitment. This \nimplies that the implementation of the Law on the Administrative Management of the Capital, \nProvinces,  Municipalities,  Districts  and  Khans,  hence  NP-SNDD,  requires  constant  and \ncontinuous policy direction from the highest body of the government.  In accordance with this, \nthe Royal Decree No. NS/RKT/1208/1429 provides the relevant mandate to an inter-ministerial \ncommittee  which  is  the  National  Committee  for  Sub-National  Democratic  Development, \nabbreviated NCDD. \n \nAs the body charged with the coordination and implementation of the NP-SNDD, the NCDD \nwill ensure that implementation of all elements of the National Program is in accordance with \nthe Law on the Administrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts \nand Khans, Law on the Administrative Management of Commune/Sangkat and RGC policies.  \nBased on the NP-SNDD approved by RGC, this includes review, consultation and approval of \nall program activities planned in the three platforms and annually in the NCDD work plans and \nbudgets.  In  order  to  assess  NP-SNDD  implementation  progress,  NCDD  will  monitor  and \nevaluate at the end of each Platform, Mid-term and end of the Program and engage DP-joint \nmonitoring  and  evaluations  missions  (through  periodic  advisory  missions,  end-of-platform \nevaluations and in-depth studies).  \n \nFurthermore, NCDD will coordinate with all concerned ministries and institutions to identify \nfunctions, along with finance, property and personnel resources to transfer to SNAs as outlined \nin the NP-SNDD.  In particular, NCDD will work closely with the Council for Administrative \nReform (CAR) and the PFM Reform Committee to align all three programs: NP-SNDD with the \nNational Program for Administrative Reform (NPAR) and the Public Financial Management \nReform Program (PFMRP). \n \nBy  mandate,  NCDD  will  report  to  the  RGC  on  the  implementation  of  the  Law  on  the \nAdministrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans, Law \non the Administrative Management of Commune/Sangkat, hence on NP-SNDD implementation \nannually and as required.  This process will thus promote interest at the highest level to oversee \nthe impact of the NP-SNDD and retain strong national commitment to the reform.  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   62 ", "Chapter 4: NP-SNDD Management   \nThe NCDD Sub-Committees, as per their mandate, will provide thematic oversight (functions \nand resources, financial and fiscal, planning and personnel) on the implementation of all NP-\nSNDD Program Areas. \n \n4.1.2.  NP-SNDD Coordination  \n \nThe NCDD Sub-Committees are an inter-ministerial thematic mechanism having the primary \nmandate to coordinate with PFMRP and NPAR and to work with concerned ministries to \ndevelop/review legal and regulatory instruments prior to NCDD decisions.  The legal and \nregulatory instruments are essential input to all five program areas in order for the NP-SNDD to \nachieve intended results. Aiming to promote citizens\u2019 voice in the policy development and \nimplementation  process,  all  NCDD  sub-committees  include  representatives  of  the  National \nLeague of Commune/Sangkat (NLC/S). \n \nThe NCDD Sub-Committee on Financial and Fiscal Affairs will work closely with the PFM \nReform Committee and its Reform Committee Secretariat, to oversee and ensure coordination of \nthe implementation of NP-SNDD Program Area 4, for which the establishment of budgeting, \nfinancing and accounting systems shall be the first major result.  In this regard, the Sub-\nCommittee will be responsible for the formulation of sub-national financial regime and property \nmanagement  legislation.  Ultimately,  MEF  through  PFM  mechanisms  and  the  NCDD  Sub-\nCommittee on Fiscal and Financial Affairs will be responsible for the manner in which funds are \nmobilized and transferred to support RGC policy commitments 2, 4 and 5 detailed in the Section \n2.2, Chapter 2 of this NP-SNDD Document. \n \nThe NCDD Sub-Committee on Functions and Resources will work with all concerned ministries \nand agencies, in particular to oversee and ensure the coordination of the implementation of \nProgram Areas 1, 3, and 5.  In particular, the Sub-Committee will support the NCDD in \ndiscussion with national ministries and agencies in the process of identifying functions and \nresponsibilities  and  their  accompanying  resources,  assets  and  personnel  which  are  to  be \ntransferred to the various levels of SNA, as per RGC policy commitments 1, 3 and 4 detailed in \nthe Section 2.2, Chapter 2 of this NP-SNDD Document. \n \nNCDD Sub-Committee on Sub-National Administration Personnel will oversee and ensure the \ncoordination of Program Area 1 and 2 activities with the State Secretariat of Public Functions, \nthe Secretariat of the Council of Administration Reform, and align NP-SNDD with the National \nProgram for Public Administrative Reform, in order to ensure the realization of RGC policy \ncommitment no. 7 detailed in the Section 2.2, Chapter 2 of this NP-SNDD Document. \n \nNCDD Sub-Committee for Sub-National Development Plans will join with the above three Sub-\nCommittees in overseeing and ensuring the coordination of the implementation of NP-SNDD \nProgram Areas 1, 3 and 4.      \n  \nThe  Technical  Working  Group  on  D&D  (TWG  on  D&D)  is  a  Government-Development \nPartners\u2019 mechanism. Its structure could be re-organized through the establishment of sub-\ngroups linked to the NCDD Sub-Committee mandates, with lead focal points on both RGC and \nDP side to focus on specific program areas.  As of now, the TWG on D&D has been a venue to \ndiscuss critical issues related to the strengthening of democratic development at sub-national \nlevels.  Particularly, the TWG on D&D discusses and informs the formulation process of the \nlegal and regulatory instruments as well as issues related to resource mobilization and financing \nof the NP-SNDD. \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   63 ", "Chapter 4: NP-SNDD Management   \nThe TWG is different from NCDD Sub-Committees as it consists of both government and DP \nrepresentatives and coordinates cross-cutting themes. Members of NCDD sub-committees who \nare high-level government officials will represent the government in the TWG on D&D.  This \nhigh-level representation is crucial in establishing smooth dialogues and linking the technical \nprocess to the political decision-making process.  In this regard, TWG on D&D will serve to \npromote cooperation and support from the RGC and DPs for the implementation of the Law on \nthe Administrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans, \nLaw on the Administrative Management of Commune/Sangkat, hence the NP-SNDD. \n \nTWG  on  D&D  and  all  NCDD  sub-committees  will  work  through  the  NCDD  Secretariat \n(NCDDS).  Presently, there are three units under the NCDDS.  The Policy Support Division \nwill mainly be assisting on the formulation of legal and regulatory instruments related to the \nimplementation  of  the  Law  on  the  Administrative  Management  of  the  Capital,  Provinces, \nMunicipalities, Districts and Khans, Law on the Administrative Management of Commune/ \nSangkat and NP-SNDD implementation. The Inter-Ministerial Division will undertake roles in \ncoordinating line ministries and DPs.  The third division of NCDDS is the Program Support \nDivision.  The primary mandate of this Program Support Division is to assist NCDD to \nexecute the NP-SNDD annual work plan and budget. \n \n4.1.3.  NP-SNDD Coordination with Development Partners  \n \nAlthough NP-SNDD is about the RGC\u2019s D&D reform, its implementation requires resources \nand support from both, the Government and DPs.  In this respect and to effectively mobilize \nresources and assistance, the NCDD will meet at least annually to approve the NP-SNDD annual \nwork plan and budget (AWPB) and review progress of NP-SNDD implementation.  For specific \nmatters related to NP-SNDD, the NCDD could convene extra-ordinary meetings with concerned \nstakeholders and DPs. \n \nThe NP-SNDD NCDD/DP Annual Meeting would discuss, among others: \n\u2022  Reports  on  the  NP-SNDD  implementation,  including  narrative  progress  and \nexpenditure/audit; \n\u2022  Technical  reviews  and  studies  conducted  by  NCDD,  donors,  independent \nresearchers, etc.; \n\u2022  Reports on any new initiatives relevant for the reform efforts; \n\u2022  Discussion of NP-SNDD resource framework and funding mechanisms; \n\u2022  Commentary provided by international experts, academic institutions, civil society \ngroups, etc.; and, \n\u2022  Endorsement of the NP-SNDD AWPB for the following year. \n \n4.1.4.  NP-SNDD Program Management Structure \n \nThe actual implementation of the five program areas of NP-SNDD will involve multiple actors/ \nimplementers. These include first and foremost central government ministries and agencies, as \nwell  as  all  levels  of  sub-national  administration  and  their  representative  organizations. \nImplementation  will  also  involve  academic  and  independent  institutions,  non-governmental \norganizations  (NGOs), and  civil  society  organizations  (CSOs) at  national  and  sub-national \nlevels. To implement and coordinate this effort smoothly, NCDDS will set up appropriate \noffices with clear terms of reference (ToRs), work plans and long and short-term national and \ninternational specialists and trainers.  The primary responsibilities of the NCDDS include: \n\u2022  Coordination of NP-SNDD annual work plan and budget formulation; \n\u2022  Operational and fund flow coordination and management; \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   64 ", "Chapter 4: NP-SNDD Management   \n\u2022  Administrative, progress and financial report preparation; \n\u2022  Design and implementation of  M&E and reporting systems;  \n\u2022  Fiduciary  responsibilities  including  internal  and  external  audit  and  other \naccountability mechanisms; \n\u2022  Liaison with NP-SNDD\u2019s DPs; \n\u2022  Provision of policy and program guidance and liaison with all SNAs and other NP-\nSNDD implementers;  \n\u2022  Management of NP-SNDD TA; and \n\u2022  Close cooperation with DPs\u2019 fiduciary mechanisms.   \n \n4.1.5.  NP-SNDD Information, Monitoring and Reporting Requirements \n \nNCDDS will ensure that documents related to NP-SNDD implementation including progress \nreports, work plans, budgets, technical reviews and studies are produced and discussed in a \ntransparent and consultative manner, for example, via occasional open meetings of the relevant \nNCDD Sub-Committees, and/or occasional conferences or seminars.  Once these documents \nhave been endorsed by NCDD, they would be accessible to the public through the NCDD \nLibrary, website and other means.  For general public updates on NP-SNDD progress, NCDD \nmonthly bulletins and periodic news press releases would complement the information and \ncapacity development materials produced by NCDDS.  \n \nFor NP-SNDD direct implementation monitoring and supervision, the NCDDS, the Directorate \nof Local Administration, NCDD member ministries\u2019 D&D working groups together with SNAs \nwill be assigned based on thematic expertise and competency.  In addition, DP\u2019s programs and \nprojects will contribute to the full-time deployment of capacity development / policy TAs and \nseparately, of fiduciary risk assurance personnel.  Furthermore, donors\u2019 regular missions would \nprovide additional means to monitor progress and guide the implementation of NP-SNDD. \n \nAs mentioned above, NCDD will be reporting to the RGC on the implementation of the Law on \nthe Administrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khans, \nLaw on the Administrative Management of Commune/Sangkat and D&D reform.  In this regard, \nreports on NP-SNDD progress would be generated from NCDD M&E system and utilized as \nNCDD annual report to the RGC. By the reporting and tracking of performance of the key \nindicators, the NCDD will be able to reconsider how implementation of the NP-SNDD and key \nelements  of  the  Law  on  the  Administrative  Management  of  the  Capital,  Provinces, \nMunicipalities,  Districts  and  Khans,  and  the  Law  on  the  Administrative  Management  of \nCommune/Sangkat is proceeding and review how to engage and/or adjust the subsequent phase, \nbased on achievements, challenges and obstacles as noted via the M&E indicator results. \n \n4.1.6.  NP-SNDD Audit \n \nIn addition to the fiduciary risk assurances performed by full-time TAs and DP\u2019s country \noffices, NP-SNDD resources will be subject to audits. \n \nInternally, auditors will be recruited from the government\u2019s competent personnel.  Externally, \nindependent annual audits will be arranged for the RGC\u2019s and DP\u2019s resources separately. \n \nFor RGC\u2019s resources provided to the SNAs, the National Audit Authority will be engaged with \nclear TOR and work plan.  This annual exercise will be done in a number of selected provinces, \ndistricts and Communes through appropriate sampling methods. \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   65 ", "Chapter 4: NP-SNDD Management   \nFor DPs\u2019 resources, private audit firms will be invited to bid for the exercise based on timeframe \nand requirements set forth by the DPs.  Since DPs\u2019 resources are used for both national and sub-\nnational levels, this independent audit will be conducted, both at the national level and in a \nnumber of selected provinces, districts and Communes. \n \nNCDDS will discuss all audit findings and recommendations, and ensure appropriate actions to \nprevent  financial  and  procedural  irregularities.    In  doing  so,  NCDDS  will  prepare  annual \nmanagement responses to the audit findings/responses and report on follow-up actions to the \nNCDD/RGC and DPs.  With endorsement from NCDD and respective DPs, audit and relevant \ndocumentations could be accessible to the public via NCCD website and other means.   \n \n4.2.  MONITORING AND EVALUATION \n \nNCDD is the RGC arm in providing comprehensive analysis and review of the implementation \nof  the  National  Program  for  Sub-National  Democratic  Development.  It  is  committed  to \ndesigning a system that will be used in management and decision-making and not only as a \nreporting mechanism. To do this, it is necessary that a well structured and dynamic monitoring \nand evaluation system be established with ongoing resources committed for its operation. In this \nway, the NCDD will be able to monitor the ongoing activities of the National Program, make \nadjustments to the program in a transparent and responsive manner and communicate to the \nRGC the impact of the overall D&D reform on the lives of citizens. The M&E framework used \nby the NCDD will not only include measurement of both outputs and outcomes, but also use of \nthis information to help manage and improve programs and services. Thus it will serve two key \npurposes: providing accountability and improving programs and services so as to make them \nmore effective. \n\u00a0\n4.2.1.  M&E Framework Links to Program Areas and D&D Objectives \n \nThe  M&E  Framework  supports  a  dynamic  process  for  refining  and  developing  additional \nindicators as needed over the 10-year program implementation period. This framework will \nallow NCDD, other government stakeholders such as line ministries, and the development \npartners to monitor implementation of each program area over time, to assess whether the \nexpected  outcomes  are  being  achieved,  and  to  develop  targeted  policies  and  program \ninterventions designed to address problem areas. \n \nThe NP\u2013SNDD Logical Framework sets out the indicative outcomes that form the base for the \nM&E Framework.  The outcome indicators specified in the Master Log Frame are the key (or \ncore) set of indicators that will be tracked, and regularly reported by NCDD, as it monitors the \nimpact and implementation of the NP-SNDD. \n \n4.2.2.  Management Arrangements for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) \n \nIn order to ensure that the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Framework for the NP-SNDD is \nimplemented and provides useful information for policy and budget decisions over the 10-year \nprogram, NCDD will activate a high-level M&E Sub-Committee to oversee Monitoring and \nEvaluation  of  NP-SNDD  implementation.  This  oversight  includes:  the  development  of \nindicators,  identification  of  data  sources  (existing  and  new,  as  necessary),  data  collection \n(including the development of new data collection instruments, as appropriate), data analysis, \ndissemination  of  the  analysis  to  decision  makers  and  other  stakeholders,  and  use  of  the \ninformation in policy and decision-making. A comprehensive guide for M&E Implementation \nFramework will be developed during the first semester of 2010.  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   66 ", "Chapter 4: NP-SNDD Management   \nThis M&E Sub-Committee will include senior representatives from the Ministry of Planning, the \nMinistry of Finance, and at least three line ministries such as MOEYS, MOH, and MRD, that \nrepresent sectors with important service impacts at the local level. Representatives from other \nline ministries, development partners, and outside experts on M&E or specific service areas may \nbe invited to participate as appropriate.  \n \nThe  M&E  Sub-Committee  will  include  a  small  staff  team  with  expertise  in  developing \nindicators, a survey expert, data analyst, and a researcher. The M&E Sub-Committee will also \nbe assisted by the M&E Advisory Group comprising primarily development partners and RGC \nofficials.  The  Advisory  Group  will  play  an  important  role  in  providing  the  development \npartners\u2019 perspective and advising the NCDD on M&E. \n \nThe role of the NCDD M&E Sub-Committee is not to collect data itself; rather it will ensure \nthat: (1) appropriate indicators are developed; (2) indicator data is requested and received in a \ntimely manner from existing government databases (such as the MOEYS\u2019s EMIS) and properly \nincorporated into the NCDD M&E database; and (3) new instruments and data collection \nprocedures are initiated where required. The M&E Sub-Committee will also ensure that the \ncorresponding meta data13 will be collected and stored for ease in conducting and analyzing the \nbaseline and follow-on surveys. Another critical responsibility of the M&E Sub-committee will \nbe to oversee data analysis and ensure regular reporting of the data so that they are used by the \nNCDD Secretariat in decision and policy-making. \n \n4.2.3.  Proposals for M&E for Monitoring National and Sub-National Levels \n \nThe NP-SNDD will use following data sources for data collection: \n\u2022  Household survey: Four stratified random household surveys will be conducted over \nthe 10-years. The first in 2010 to establish the baseline, and three additional follow-\non surveys in years 3, 6, and 9. The household survey will ask a randomly chosen \nadult in a household questions about satisfaction with service quality, accessibility of \nservices, access to information, etc., and also obtain demographic information such \nas age, marital status, income, and education so that data can be analyzed by different \nrespondent characteristics. While data will be collected at the Commune, district, and \nprovincial level, it will be representative, and therefore not allow analysis for each \nindividual Commune, district, or province.  \n\u2022  Administrative  records:  With  the  transfer  of  select  functions  from  the  line \nministries  to  the  SNAs,  the  M&E  team  will  create  templates  for  regular \nadministrative records to be reported back to the line ministries and the NCDD for \nanalysis.  \n\u2022  Council and SNA staff surveys: Data will be collected from council members and \nspecific SNA staff from representative Communes, districts, and provinces. SNA \nstaff will include, for example, the finance and budget officer, human resource \nmanagers, etc., who will be requested to provide information on program-specific \nissues quarterly, biannually, or annually as needed.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n13 Meta data refers to all the related information (or data) that accompanies data collection such as definition of \nterms, frequency and date of collection, sampling framework, response rates, etc.  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   67 ", "Chapter 4: NP-SNDD Management   \n4.2.4.  Donor Alignment with NP M&E Framework \n \nThe targets identified in the M&E Framework and through the framework process over time \nquantify desired achievements of the policy commitments and are key to discussions with the \ndevelopment partners over the life of the NP-SNDD. As discussed above, the RGC and the \ndevelopment  partners  are  committed  to  implementing  the  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid \nEffectiveness. With respect to M&E, donor alignment has two aspects:  (1) using the M&E \nFramework to identify and agree upon one set of expected outcomes for D&D reform in \nCambodia and (2) aligning reporting, monitoring, and evaluation efforts to reduce donor- or \nproject-specific data collection and reporting requirements and to increasingly move toward \nusing government systems. \n \n4.3.  RISKS AND RISK REDUCING STRATEGIES FOR NP-SNDD  \n \nImplementation of Cambodia\u2019s Decentralization and Deconcentration Reform to ensure sub-\nnational democratic development is a complex undertaking which will affect all levels of the \nGovernment\u2019s technical and political institutions and actors.  Successful implementation of the \nNP will foster democratic development, improve access and quality of service delivery and \ncontribute to the reduction of poverty across the country, especially for marginalized groups of \ncitizens. \n \nAs in the case of any large and complex reform program, there are numerous risks. As a \nGovernment-wide  reform  with  impact  across  the  whole  territory  of  Cambodia  and  at  all \nadministrative and governance levels, the role of the NCDD and its Sub-Committees, backed up \nby strong political support, will be paramount. The articulation of NP-SNDD activities with the \nPublic Finance Management Reform Program and the National Program for the Administrative \nReform as well as with sector reforms will be one of the particular challenges to be faced during \nimplementation. \n \nDuring the formulation of the NP-SNDD, key risks as outlined in the Table 4.1 below were \nidentified  and  assessed  against  the  likelihood  of  risk  arising  during  the  NP-SNDD \nimplementation.  The  table  first  identifies  key  areas  of  potential  risk,  based  on  the  main \norganizing principles of the National Program, via the goals, outcomes and institutional results \nof the platforms and the five program areas. The likelihood captures the probability that the risk \nmight arise, graded high, medium and low. The potential impact measures the level of negative \nimpact a risk might have in achieving the intended goals of the reform, expressed as high, \nmedium and low. \n \n \nTable 4.1: Risks and Risk Reducing Strategies \nPotential \nRisks  Likelihood  Mitigation Actions \nImpact \nCouncil\u2019s institutional  Medium  Medium  \u2022  PA 1 incorporates processes to establish basic \nauthority is not fully  authorities, competencies and structures and \nestablished as the  to define clear responsibilities, roles, and \ncoordinating body for all  internal accountability of SNAs \nactivities in its territory   \u2022  The Capacity Development Plan will build \nleadership and oversight roles of councilors \n\u2022  Via NCDD actions and Sub-Committees, \nraise the awareness of line agency officials \nand the public about the Laws and Principles \nof democratic development and unified \nadministration \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   68 ", "Chapter 4: NP-SNDD Management   \nPotential \nRisks  Likelihood  Mitigation Actions \nImpact \nNCDD and Line Ministries  Medium  High  \u2022  Should line Ministries delay substantial \ndo not transfer to SNAs  functional transfer as per identified fast track \nspecific, clearly defined  list, the NCDD and/or higher political levels \nfunctional and service  will be required to take decisions to ensure \ndelivery competencies (both  implementation of the Law on the \ndelegated and assigned  Administrative Management of the Capital, \nfunctions) with associated  Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and \nresponsibility, authority and  Khans and the Law on Administrative \naccountability.

FINANCING NP \u2013 SNDD \n \nRGC is committed to financing the NP-SNDD, but as a strong government-DP partnership will \nbe necessary to support D&D reform in the long term, it also requires significant commitment \nfrom Development Partners.  In the next sections issues related to the financing of the NP are \npresented, and specific issues addressed are the financing mechanism, transition strategies of \nfunding modalities required to support the National Program and the estimated cost.  \n \n5.1.1.  Key imperatives: NP-SNDD Funding is Program Based and On-Budget  \n \nThe financing modalities of the NP-SNDD are predicated to be consistent with the principles \nbehind  the  RGCs  policy  commitments,  as  expressed  in  Chapter  2  of  this  document  and \nconsistent with the organization of the NP across five program areas which recognize the \niterative nature of government reform and the interlocking nature of government operations and \nsystems.  Further, over the 10 years of the NP-SNDD, the financing approach will work towards \nmeeting the commitments of the Cambodia Declaration on Enhancing Aid Effectiveness signed \nin October 2006. \n \nAlthough the design of the National Program for Sub-National Democratic Development has \ntaken place during a period of increased economic and financial stress on public resources due to \nthe global economic crisis, this is not intended to serve as a short-term fix to the symptoms of \nthis crisis. The program-based approach is expected to run concurrently with separate programs \nof the development partners which seek to address immediate needs arising from the financial \ncrisis. \n \nA key principle for funding the NP-SNDD is that whatever the financing modality, the flow of \nfunds must be on-budget at the national and sub-national level. On-budget is defined as funds \nappearing as revenues and expenditures, but not necessarily being planned by or processed \nthrough the RGC financial systems in the initial years. \n \nThe AWPB process has provided a comprehensive and rules-based mechanism for mobilizing, \nprioritizing, and allocating DP and RGC support to communes, related support services at the \nprovincial level, and to ensure the financing of pilot projects, for example, at the district level. \nAs discussed in Section 5.2, the AWPB process will need to be reviewed and modified.   \n \n5.1.2.  DP Funding Flows and Funding Mechanisms   \n \nThe  NP-SNDD\u2018s  proposed  flow  of  funds  and  funding  mechanisms  shifts  the  assistance \nframework in support of D&D to a program-based approach to achieve broader sector results. \nThe structure of the program requires consideration be given to new categorization of funding \nflows and approaches to funding.  The cost estimate of the NP for 2010 is provided in Section \n5.4 and reflects estimated contributions from the Royal Government of Cambodia. \n \nA).  Funding Flows   \n \nThe NP-SNDD is complex and will involve many national and sub-national participants and \nstakeholders.  \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   71 ", "Chapter 5: NP-SNDD Finance and Budget    \nThe specific types of support which will be needed to ensure achievement of the NP goals and \nobjectives, via RGC and DP inputs are defined below in order to establish a common vocabulary \nand meanings.  \n \n1).  Investments  for  institutional  support  and  capacity  development:  Enhance  and \nincrease individuals and institutions capacity to govern democratically and improve service \ndelivery through the use of government systems and operating procedures.  This expenditure \ncategory includes: \n \n1.1.  Technical assistance to create the enabling environment: Policy development \nand Systems operations/development \n \n1.2.  Non-salary  administrative  operations  \u2013  hard  expenditures:  The  immediate \nestablishment and creation of basic working conditions for SNAs, particularly for \nthe  new  districts/  municipalities.  This  may  include  buildings,  vehicles,  small \nelectricity  generation  investment,  computers  and  other  IT  equipment,  office \nfurniture, etc. \n \n1.3.  Non-salary  administrative  operations  \u2013  soft  expenditures:  These  include \nexpenditures for fuel, per diem, training, office supplies \n \n1.4.  Fiduciary Oversight and Management of DP Program TA and Investments: \nThe management and oversight of use of DP-provided funds; processes which \nensure that DPAF provided funds are spent efficiently and effectively in the manner \nas authorized by RGC-DP agreements and any SOP manuals, etc., and can be \nprogrammed, reported, accounted for and audited \n \n2).  Investments for projects: The construction of specific projects to enhance / increase / \nimprove service delivery by the different tiers of SNAs, and for which the operating and \nmaintenance costs are budgeted for in SNA budgets.Specific limitations should be applied, \nnamely: the only investments eligible for financing under the NP are linked directly to the \ntransfer of functions to that tier of SNA. \n \nTable 5.1.a illustrates expected donor evolution of support by type of expenditure. For all types \nof expenditures, it is expected that RGC funding and inputs will increase as donor support is \nreduced in order to create / ensure more sustainable and country-funded SNA systems. However \nthe extent of RGC scaling up and donor scaling down is different according to the expenditure \ncategory. \n \nSignificant donor support, representing the primary source of funding over the period of the NP \nis estimated for the 1st expenditure category concerning the \u201ctechnical assistance to create the \nenabling environment and fiduciary oversight and management\u201d and  the second category \n\u201cinvestment for projects\u201d. \n \nSome cost-sharing and greater contribution to the above expenditures by the Government is \nexpected to occur by Platform 3. \n \nExpenditure  category  1.2.  \u201cnon-salary  administrative  operations\u201d  represents  demand  for \nsupport in the short- to medium-term for the associated start-up costs to create and equip \ncouncils  and  administrations  at  the  sub-national  level,  particularly  for  districts  and \nmunicipalities \u2013 this cost will be most intense in Platform 1, perhaps continuing to Platform 2, \nbut should in all cases be completed by the end of Platform 2. \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   72 ", "Chapter 5: NP-SNDD Finance and Budget    \nThe recurring costs of operating a new system of governance at the sub-national level is \naccounted for by expenditure category 1.3. (on-going \u201cSoft expenditures\u201d), the donor share \nshould be significantly reduced and/or have disappeared by Platform 3, to be replaced by \nGovernment budget via transfers, or sufficient sources of own-source tax or fee revenues of the \nSNAs; in the absence of such a transition, it will be difficult for SNAs to be eventually \nsustainable.  \n \nTable 5.1.a: Illustration of evolution of donor support over the NP Platforms \n \nPlatform 1  Platform 2  Platform 3 \nExpenditure categories \n(2010-2012)  (2013-2015)  (2016-2019) \n1.

Funding Mechanisms   \n \nThe possible funding flow mechanisms are illustrated in Table 5.1.b as a matrix by type of \nexpenditure categories and financing mechanisms. There will be flexibility in funding flows in \norder to adjust to specific donor institutional requirements and limitations, while respecting the \noverall goal of moving to a program basis. The four main funding mechanisms would include: \n \nB-1).  Direct budget support via the National Treasury \n \nUnder this category, the support for conditional and unconditional transfer mechanisms should \nbe  linked  to  the  actual  transfer  of  functions  and  RGC  counterpart  funding.  In  respect  to \ndevelopment of new District and Provincial unconditional transfer funds, it will be essential \nfrom  the  outset  to  establish  the  formula  mechanisms  based  on  Cambodia\u2019s  budget  and \naccounting division between recurring and capital expenditures to ensure adequate O&M costs, \nas discussed elsewhere throughout the National Program document. \n \nB-2).  National Program pooled or basket \u201cD&D Fund\u201d \n \nUnder this category donor funds would be pooled and managed by a trust agent or by the NCDD \npool administrator.  NCDD would consider using a competitive procurement process to select \nthe pool administrator.  The pooled or basket \u201cD&D Fund\u201d would coordinate the fund accounts \nfor  technical  assistance  to  create  the  enabling  environment,  the  non-salary  administrative \noperations \u2013 start up.  A series of accounts would be established and budget agreements entered \ninto that would be managed by NCDD Secretariat.   \n \nB-3).  Pooled or basket \u201cCost Sharing Fiduciary oversight and management fund\u201d \n \nAll donors would contribute to the Cost Sharing Fund that supports the NCDD operations, and \ncovers the cost of implementing budget agreements, performing program audits, and manage the \nprocedural issues related to program implementation.  A Cost Sharing Fund Steering committee \nwould be established.  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   73 ", "Chapter 5: NP-SNDD Finance and Budget    \nB-4).   Bilateral RGC-Donor agreements \n \nBilateral  agreements  would  fund  the  cost  associated  with  provision  of  investments  for \ninstitutional  support  and  capacity  development  covering  technical  assistance  to  create  the \nenabling environment and non-salary administrative operations \u2013 start up, and investments for \nprojects. However, to encourage donor alignment and to ensure harmonization among donors \nprograms, NCDD will encourage bilateral agreements to financially support and utilize the \nNCDDS for project implementation. \n \nTable 5.1.b: Potential Funding Flow Options by Expenditure Category \n \nB-1).

Financing and Linkages with SNAs \n \nTable  5.1.c  links  the  expenditure  categories  with  the  program  areas  of  the  NP.  Not  all \nexpenditure categories will be relevant for each of the program areas, nor will funding flows be \nrequired across all three Platforms in all cases. \n \nThe expenditure categories relevant for all five program areas are: (1.1) TA to create the \nenabling environment; and (1.4.) fiduciary oversight and management. \n \nIn the implementation of the NP-SNDD, donors may be expected to approach the NP from \ndifferent angles, each of which has implications in terms of expenditure categories, type of \nfunding flow and whether the focus of assistance will be at national or sub-national level or both \n(or at one specific tier of the sub-national level). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   74 ", "Chapter 5: NP-SNDD Finance and Budget    \nTable 5.1.c: Expenditure Categories by NP Program Areas (PA) \n \nPA 1 \nPA 2  PA 3  PA 4  PA 5 \nSNA \nExpenditure Categories  HR  Transfer of  Budget, Finance,  Support \nOrganization \nManagement  Functions  Property  Institutions \nDevelopment \n1.

Principles for a Joint Partnership Arrangement (JPA) \nshall  assume  that  a  pooled  mechanism  or  basket  arrangement  will  be  established  to  fund \nelements of the NP (for example, investments for programs, technical assistance to create the \nenabling environment, support to administration operations).  \n \n5.2.  TRANSITION STRATEGIES  \n \nSince D&D reform cuts across all sectors, NP-SNDD calls for alignment and harmonization, of \nboth the RGC and DPs\u2019 actions, in a gradual approach that ensures a seamless provision of \nservices and programs.  In line with this principle, implementation of NP-SNDD will require a \ntransition strategy that changes how decisions are made and resources are allocated for those \nprograms and projects which support the development of government institutions and systems \nnecessary to achieve the goals of D&D reform.   \n \n5.2.1.  Alignment and Harmonization of the three Reforms (D&D, PFM and PA Reforms) \n \nThe NP-SNDD management structure anticipates a closer alignment and harmonization of the \nimplementation of the three cross cutting reforms.  More concretely, close coordination amongst \nthese  three  programs  is  vital  for  transitioning  from  the  currently  centralized  and  vertical \nfinancial and civil servant management systems to the establishment of a D&D SNAs\u2019 system. \n  \nNCDD, CAR, MEF and Secretariat of Public Functions should identify the key pieces of \nlegislation, challenges and policies that are common to each reform effort to develop a plan of \naction and schedule to complete action.  Immediate attention should be given to the following:  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   75 ", "Chapter 5: NP-SNDD Finance and Budget    \n1.  Finalization and adoption of the law on financial regime and property management at \nsub-national  levels  and  its  related  legal  instruments  on  sub-national  resources, \nbudgeting, procurement and accounting systems.  \n2.  Re-structuring the existing provincial Salakhet budget, financial, accounting and \nprocurement systems in accordance with the SNA financial and asset management \nprinciples. \n3.  Review  of  the  C/SF  to  allow  for  the  re-classification  of  recurrent  and  capital \nexpenditures in accordance with the national budget classification and prompting for \na more sustainable service delivery  \n4.  Formulation of the sub-national civil servant statute in accordance with the public \ncivil servant code; \n \n5.2.2.  Alignment and Harmonization of Existing Programs and Projects      \n \nThe first stage of implementation of the National Program will take place during a transition \nperiod which will start from beginning of 2010 and is likely to last through the first Platform. \nAmong the challenges of the transition period will be to ensure that the ongoing projects can \nachieve their objectives with minimal disruption, yet that they take advantage of and draw on \nany opportunity for flexibility in actions and support which will contribute to achieving NP-\nSNDD intended objectives and results. \n \nUnder the 2009 NCDD AWPB, there are at least 15 programs and projects funded by different \ndonors as shown in the below Table 5.2. \n \nTable 5.2: On-going D&D Programs & Projects \nNo.  Project Title  Start Date  End Date \n1  PSDD  2007  2010 \n2  DDLG  2006  2010 \n3  RPRP (IFAD)  2006  2010 \n4  RULIP (IFAD)  2008  2012 \n5  RILGP (WB)  2007  2010 \n6  LASED (WB)  2008  2013 \n7  DfGG (WB)  2009  2012 \n8  ADMAC  2006  2009 \n9  NRM&L  2006  2010 \n10  Seth Koma  1996  2010 \n11  IDLD  2008  2010 \n12  CCDP2  2007  2009 \n13  TSSL  2006  2010 \n14  LAAR  2006  2010 \n15  UNFPA  2006  2010 \n \nSome of these on-going projects will come to an end as late as 2013.  This means that these \nprograms and projects will need careful transition before aligning fully under the NP-SNDD. \n \n1).  To the degree possible, all DPs\u2019 D&D programs and projects being implemented by \ndifferent MOI branches/departments shall be aligned with the NP-SNDD and hand over overall \noversight responsibility to NCDD/NP-SDD management structures.  This will again reduce the \ntransaction costs in terms of having parallel PIUs at both, national and sub-national levels, but \nmore importantly will maximize the potential impacts of the D&D reform program.   \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   76 ", "Chapter 5: NP-SNDD Finance and Budget    \n2).  Each D&D program/project could undertake this transitioning exercise separately under \ndifferent timeline but the transition shall reflect the principles described in the DPAF section for \na Joint Partnership Agreement (JPA) as a guiding document of this exercise.  Success of this \ntransition  will  align  and  harmonize  the  DPs\u2019  planning,  budgeting,  financing  (including \nprocurement) and reporting (including M&E) systems into the government\u2019s own strengthened, \naccountable, and transparent system.  \n \nA).  NCDD Program Support  \n \nThe  Program  Support  for  Democratic  Development  through  Decentralization  and \nDeconcentration (PSDD) is a major project in the sense that it has been providing the core D&D \nprogram  technical  assistance  and  operational  support  to  the  implementation  of  all  D&D \nprograms/projects, more specifically the NCDD annual plans and budgets.  In this regard and \nalthough PSDD is coming to an end by the end of 2010, quick transition of this project would \nimpact many other programs and projects under the D&D.  \n \nTherefore, this first platform of 2010-2012 will be crucial for a flexible PSDD successor \naligning its objectives and activities fully under the NP-SNDD.   With many UN projects \ncoming to an end in 2010, one possible arrangement could be that the UN establishes a joint UN \nagencies D&D support program to the NP-SNDD.  The merging, however, should be done \nthrough a careful review exercise in order to ensure that unique achievements and components \n(e.g. the support to the NLC/S and promoting youth and women\u2019s voices of other UN projects \nsuch as DDLG and Seth Koma) are captured and maintained. \n \nIn doing so consideration should be given to: \n1.  Disaggregating the current PSDD TA expenditures from those related to providing \nfiduciary oversight in order to secure the DP support for TA and to develop the \nstrategy for integrating the fiduciary responsibility into the government\u2019s systems.  \n2.  In line with the Development Partner Assistance Framework (DPAF), enter into an \nagreement for the provision of TA, ensuring that the structure of the TA reflects the \nNP-SNDD program  areas  and reduces  the share  of  transition  costs  in  terms  of \nfiduciary risk. \n \nB).  NCDD Budget  \n \nThe NP-SNDD is designed to move from forming and implementing development projects to \ncreating and establishing institutional capacity to carry out routine operations and projects; using \ntheir authority and resources in a way that ensures investments are protected, that the quality and \nquantity of services provided improves and that these improvements can be sustained over time. \nFunctions will be transferred which inherently means that SNAs must think in terms of ongoing \nservice delivery rather than projects. Further, the operating and capital budget structure of SNAs \naccommodates change. Therefore, during Platform 1 it will be necessary to realign the NCDD \nAnnual Budget and Budget Classifications to ensure that the flow of NCDD funds reflects \noperating budgets, clearly disaggregating those funds allocated for development of institutional \nand individual capacity from those allocated for capital projects and operating cost.    \n \n5.3.  NP-SNDD INDICATIVE 3-YEAR PROGRAM   \n \nThe NP-SNDD Logical Framework detailed in Chapter 3 lay out a comprehensive set of actions \nrequired to meet the goals and objectives of democratic development through decentralization \nand deconcentration for the next 10 years. Furthermore, Section 2.7 of Chapter 2 provides \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   77 ", "Chapter 5: NP-SNDD Finance and Budget    \njustifications with regard to the outputs required for each platform.  In this regard, this Section \n5.3 focuses on implementation approaches and an indicative 3-year program. \n \n5.3.1.  Implementation Approaches \n \nThe magnitude of the NP requires that consideration be given to asymmetric implementation.   \nWhile it is recognized that all SNAs must abide by existing laws, their ability to effectively \ncarryout the laws will be dependent on the capacity of the SNA officials (which individual and \ninstitutional  capacity).  That  said  there  are  some  elements  of  implementing  the  support  to \ndecentralization that are universal, while others can be introduced and then taken to scale.  \n   \nA).  Universal approach must be used for any elements of D&D that relates to of public \nareas in which misuse funds could occur. There are three critical issues: \n\u2022  SNAs  fiduciary  responsibilities  consistent  with  the  revenues  and  financial \nmanagement.  Lack of support in this area can lead to intended or unintended of \npublic money and lead to considerable public distrust and corrupt activities. \n\u2022  Councils must be able to provide information and explain to their citizens about their \nbudget allocation decisions. Decision about the use of the council\u2019s funds shall be \nmade  through  participatory  planning  and  investment  programming.    Therefore, \nconsideration must be on the support to the councils in developing their 5- year \ndevelopment plan and 3-year rolling investment program.   \n\u2022  Payroll. Once SNAs are assigned responsibility for some part of the management of \nCivil Servants, it will be critical that all SNAs have proper payroll and minimal \npersonnel management systems in place to protect the employee rights and to ensure \nthat there are no ghost civil servants on the SNA payroll.  Because decentralization \nbrings the government closer to the people, citizens can observe which employees are \nactually working and which ones are not, absent good monitoring of personnel could \nlead to breaking the trust with the citizens.  \n \nB).  Specific programs shall be piloted before taken to scale and will reflect demand and \ncapacity as follows:  \n\u2022  The baseline capacity assessment will inform the approach to implementing the NP \nin two ways.  First, the capacity assessment will explain the gap in understanding and \nresources to carry out activities related to universal issue and can guide the NCDD in \nseeking funds for these critical issues.   Second, the capacity assessment will inform \nthe NCDD which SNAs could adapt new practices both in terms of demand and \nability.  \n\u2022  Scaling up the transfer of functions will also be considered.  Some functions will be \ntransferred to all SNAs in some form (assigned or delegated), however, this may not \nbe universal.  Data as to the demand by citizens and SNAs will be can be used to \ndetermine in which areas/regions pilots related to the transfer of functions should be \npromulgated.   \n \n5.3.2.  3-Year Indicative Program   \n \nIn order to establish and institutionalize governing systems and structures at the sub-national and \nnational level that ensure implementation of policies, and moving towards effective and efficient \ndelivery of services by SNAs, there will be many transitional and start-up activities for all five \nprogram areas in Platform 1. Those priority actions include the formulation and adoption of \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   78 ", "Chapter 5: NP-SNDD Finance and Budget    \nrelevant laws and other necessary legal instruments and the establishment of structures, systems \nand procedures for SNA operations. These priorities are defined in each of the five program area \nlogframe and will be detailed in the 2010 Indicative Program (i.e. NCDD 2010 AWPB) and NP-\nSNDD 3-Year Indicative Program. The NP-SNDD 3-Year Indicative Program for 2011-2013 \nwill be developed during the first quarter of 2010 based on the NP-SNDD five Program Areas \nand 2010 NCDD AWPB. The NP-SNDD 3-Year Indicative Program for 2014-2016 will be \ndeveloped beginning of 2013 based on the review of the implementation of the Indicative \nProgram for 2011-2013. The Indicative Program for 2017-2019 will be developed beginning of \n2016 based on the review of the implementation of the Indicative Program for 2014-2016.  Each \nof the 3-year Indicative Programs will further be utilized for the development of an annual work \nplan and budget (AWPB).  \n \n5.4.  INDICATIVE NP-SNDD COSTING  \n \nIn order for the D&D reform to succeed, NP-SNDD calls for changes of structures, systems and \nworking procedures as well as financial commitments from both the RGC and DPs. Sections 5.1 \nand 5.2 of this Chapter 5 provide details of how funding mechanisms and existing programs and \nprojects could be transitioning into the government systems whereas this section focuses on \nwhat level of financial resources is required for the first/transition year of 2010. \n \n5.4.1.  Scope \n \nThe D&D reform cuts across all sectors and will be carried out at both, national and sub-national \nlevels. Therefore, associated costs can be categorized as those related to the development of \nSNA  and  related  institutions,  service  improvements  and  service  delivery.  During  the \nimplementation  of  the  NP-SNDD, the  government  will  transfer  functions  with  appropriate \nfinance and assets and personnel to the SNAs. Functions include permissive and obligatory ones.   \n \n5.4.2.  Resource Allocation Guidance  \n \nThe  depth  and  range  of  activities  defined  in  10  Year  NP-SNDD  will  require  considerable \nresources from the government and from development partners. Given that limited resources will \nrequire making strategic choices for instance as to targeting technical assistance, building the core \ncompetencies of national and sub-national institutions and investments, it is necessary to provide \nguidelines as to the use of these proposed resources. Thus, the NP-SNDD proposes that: \n1.  Municipal, district and khan have had the least amount of authority; in particular, \nthey have not been a budget unit and given that they are the logical tier at which the \nactual  delivery  of  services  will  occur  (either  on  behalf  of  the  citizens  of  the \nmunicipal, district and khan in general or as required by Communes and Sangkats), \nsupport to District Councils and Administration is a top priority.  Resources should \nbe allocated to bring municipal, district and khan to a minimal level of capacity so \nthat functions can be transferred.    \n2.  Because  there has been considerable progress  made in building the  capacity of \nCommunes and Sangkats it will be important to capture the momentum and protect \nthe investment made.  Priority should be given to rolling out and up the lessons \nlearned at the Commune/ Sangkat level. In particular the lessons learned should \ninform the relationship between the Commune and Sangkats and the municipal, \ndistrict and khan which reinforces the C/S ability to hold Districts accountable and to \ninform the C/S support required from municipal, district and khan.    \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   79 ", "Chapter 5: NP-SNDD Finance and Budget    \n3.  Capital and provincial administrations have in place the greatest capacity of the three \ntiers  and  thus  will  have  the  greater  capability  to  carry  out  their  administrative \nresponsibility and exercise their authority that corresponds with transfer of functions.  \nPriority is given to integrating the systems developed through past investment in the \nExecutive Committee Technical Units of the Capital and Provinces, and reframing \nthe current administrative practices to better correspond to the new structure of SNA  \n4.  Considerable resources should be targeted for deepening the general understanding \nof  and  expectations  for  democratic  development  through  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration in the general public and within line ministries and SNAs.   \n \n5.4.3.  NP-SNDD Budget  \n \nWhile NP-SNDD 3-year indicative budgets need to be formulated, 2010 is seen as a transition \nyear.  For DPs\u2019 resources, a number of D&D projects are nearing completion and follow-up \nprojects are being formulated to contribute and align with the NP.  In this regard, the NP-SNDD \n2010 budget has been costed based on 2009 NCDD AWPB and the capital/provincial budget \nfigures as indicated in the 2009 National Budget Law.

The  2014-2016  NP-SNDD  indicative  budget  will  be  formulated  at  the \nbeginning of 2013 based on the review of the implementation of NP-SNDD budget for 2011-\n2013 and the emerging economic situation while 2017-2019 NP-SNDD indicative budget will \nbe formulated at the beginning of 2016 based on the review of the implementation of NP-SNDD \nbudget for 2014-2016 and the emerging economic situation. \n \nThe 10-Year (2010-2019) NP-SNDD document was deliberated and agreed by the NCDD on the \n24th March 2010 and approved by the RGC\u2019s Ministers Council on 28th May 2010.    \n \n&\u00b0'\n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   80 ", " \nAnnex 1 \nSUMMARY OUTCOMES \nFROM THE FIVE DIALOGUES \n ", "Annex 1: Summary Outcomes from the Five Dialogues     \nANNEX 1 \nSUMMARY OUTCOMES FROM THE FIVE DIALOGUES \n \n1.  Approach for the Dialogue Process of the National Program   \n \nThe formulation of the 10-Year National Program for Sub-national Democratic Development \nstarts from the accomplishments of the last 15 years. In keeping with the principle of steady but \nthoughtful reform and recognizing that the implementation of the 10-Year Program will only \nhappen  through  commitment  from  and  broad-based  support  of  all  branches  of  the  Royal \nGovernment of Cambodia, it was incumbent upon the formulation team to promote a process \nthat  allowed  for  the  greatest  inclusion  of  representatives  from  government  ministries  and \nagencies, sub-national administrators, development partners, and non-government organizations \nas possible. The process used needed to ensure that the lessons learned from past accomplishments \nbe captured and inform the next phase of reform.   \n \nTo that end, a series of dialogues is underway allowing for a consensus view on the key issues \nthat will define the principles and the parameters of the reform effort. The themes of the \ndialogues reflect the important aspects of democratic development through decentralization and \ndeconcentration articulated in the Strategic Framework for Decentralization and Deconcentration \nReform, the Law on the Administrative Management of the Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, \nDistricts and Khans (Organic Law) and the Law on Administrative Management of Communes \nand Sangkats. Themes of the Dialogues include:  \n\u2022  Overall Objectives of the D&D Process \n\u2022  Assignment of Local Functions and Responsibilities \n\u2022  Local Finances and Budget \n\u2022  Accountability, Oversight and Responsiveness \n\u2022  Local Management and Administration \n \nIn addition to the dialogues, considerable emphasis was placed on working with and through \nministries individually on transfer of functions, resources and personnel. Pre- and post-dialogue \nworking meetings have been held (and will continue to be held) in key ministries in order to \nfurther elaborate the strategies for D&D reform within sectors and ministries.  \n \nThe results of this inclusive approach have laid a firm foundation from which to commence the \nimplementation of program activities. Subsequent sections of this program document provide \ndetails as to the results; however, it is important to note the more overarching achievements of \nthe approach here. \n \nFirst,  the  dialogue  approach  has  broadened  the  audience  of  government  officials  that  are \nconversant in the objectives of the Strategic Framework for D&D as well as the provisions of \nthe Organic Law. As a result, they are beginning to internalize the need for, the implications of, \nand the considerable challenges to implementing reform. \n \nSecond, specific attention has been given to the interface among the three main ongoing cross \nsector reforms: Public Financial Management Reform (PFM), Public Administration Reform \n(PAR) and Decentralization and Deconcentration (D&D). Both PFM and PAR intersect with \neach other as well as independently and jointly with D&D. The 10-Year Program will capture \nthese double and the triple interfaces, ensuring coordination and sequencing of reform in order \nthat the transfer of functions, finances, and personnel occurs without disruption of government \nactivity. It should be noted that a number of ministries have activated or instituted D&D \nworking groups and are considering how to incorporate D&D reform into overall sector reform.  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   81 ", "Annex 1: Summary Outcomes from the Five Dialogues     \nFinally,  the  dialogue  process  and  subsequent  working  meetings  allowed  for  a  common \nunderstanding to be formed with regard to the process and the effects of reform, especially as \nthey relate to the size of government and resource availability. It is now understood that reform \nleading  to  formable  sub-national  administrations  has  both  downstream  and  upstream \nimplications, which, if not managed properly could dramatically expand the size of government \nwithout improving the performance of sub-national administrations, communes, and sangkats. It \nis necessary to take these implications into account in the overall program in order to ensure that \nthere is limited if any disruption to government operations and to delimit the size of government \nso that national and sub-national officials understand that decentralization and deconcentration \nrequire a shift rather than immediate growth in the size of the overall government bureaucracy.   \n \n2.  Findings for Each Dialogue  \n \n2.1.  Dialogue 1: Overall Objectives and Strategies of Democratic Development \nfor Formulation of the National Program for Sub-National Democratic \nDevelopment on November 05, 2008 \n \nThe aim of Dialogue 1 was to allow for a deep discussion on the overall objectives of D&D \nreform described in the D&D Strategic Framework and the Organic Law. Participants from \nNCDD member ministries, other selected sector ministries as well as experienced practitioners \nfrom sub-national level institutions (selective participants from provinces, districts, communes \nand  NGOs)  were  able  to  discuss  lessons  learned  from  the  current  decentralization  and \ndeconcentration efforts and were able to express their views and visions on D&D for the next 10 \nyears and reach consensus on approaches to materialize those common D&D visions. \n \nAgreements: \n\u2022  The RGC\u2019s D&D reform is a process that will affect all stakeholders and needs to be \nimplemented in coordination with the other major RGC reforms including PFM and \nNPAR. \n\u2022  D&D reform  must come out of the Cambodian  context and be formulated and \nimplemented step-by-step. \n\u2022  D&D reform will change the role of the central government to setting policy and \nstandards, and providing direction/regulation for the sub-national level. \n\u2022  D&D  reform  is  understood  differently  by  different  stakeholders  and  a  broader \nunderstanding and agreement on the concept and terms is required. \n\u2022  There  are four  critical  issues  that  require  further  discussion:  administration  and \npower, budget and finance, capacity, and human resource management. \n \n2.2.  Dialogue 2: Sub-National Functions on December 11, 2008 \n \nDialogue 2 addressed the theme of transfer of functions between the central government, the \nprovince, district, commune and other entities in the context of the D&D Strategic Framework, \nthe Law on Administrative Management of Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and \nKhan, and the Law on the Administrative Management of Communes and Sangkats. \n \nAgreements: \n\u2022  Functions must be transferred with appropriate responsibilities and authority over \nfinance (including assets) and human resources. \n\u2022  More work must be done with the ministries to define more clearly what is meant by \nthe \u201ctransfer of functions.\u201d \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   82 ", "Annex 1: Summary Outcomes from the Five Dialogues     \n\u2022  The  objective  of  transferring  functions  to  SNAs  is  to  promote  democratic \ndevelopment and service delivery \n\u2022  Selected ministries\u2014Education, Rural Development, Social Affairs, Public Works, \nIndustry and Mines\u2014made a preliminary identification of candidate functions for \ntransfer in the short, medium, and long term. \n \n2.3.  Dialogue 3: Local Finance and Budget on January 13, 2009 \n \nIn Dialogue 3 participants held a lengthy discussion on the necessary reform required for local \nfinance and budget in support of D&D reform. Key issues discussed included the level of \nresources available to sub-national governments; the source of those revenues; how and when \nresources become available; the rules and procedures for preparing, adopting implementing and \nreporting on the annual sub-national budgets. Further, participants worked to determine how  \nkey issues, for which it is essential that the PFMRP action plan for D&D and the actions related \nto fiscal decentralization in the 10-year program need to be consistent and work to reinforce \neach other, would be discussed. This Dialogue was co-organized by the Ministry of Interior and \nthe Ministry of Economy and Finance.   \n \nAgreements: \n\u2022  Finance follows function. \n\u2022  MEF and MOI will work together to adapt the PFM Objective 27 (D&D) workplan \nto complement the Organic Law and NP-SNDD. \n\u2022  The  line  ministries  working  on  PFM  need  to  also  take  D&D  reform  into \nconsideration through the PFM and D&D working groups. \n\u2022  At the Capital and the province level, budgets already exist and the task is to bring \nbudget implementation in line with the Organic Law. \n\u2022  At the district (and municipality) level, budgets do not currently exist, so the task to \nestablish a district budget system. \n \n2.4.  Dialogue 4: Accountability, Responsiveness and Oversight on February 19, 2009 \n \nThe primary objective of Dialogue 4 was to seek consensus on issues and possible approaches \nrelated  to  accountability,  oversight  and  responsiveness  at  sub-national  levels  in  the  D&D \nreforms. In particular, discussions focused on demarcating clear lines of accountability of sub-\nnational governments.  This includes the horizontal lines of accountability of sub-national units \nto the respective council and the vertical lines of accountability of different levels of councils.  \nAdditionally, participants considered mechanism to ensure accountability at sub-national levels \nwill actually be exercised and lead to greater responsiveness to citizens and improvement of \nservices. \n \nAgreements: \n\u2022  To hold an administration accountable, its responsibilities, authorities, finance and \npersonnel must be clearly defined; this requires restructuring of resources, including \nstaff and finance. \n\u2022  Sub-national levels have two primary lines of accountability; one to the citizens in \ntheir territories, and another to the national government. \n\u2022  Downward accountability to constituents is particularly crucial for the confidence in \nthe whole sub-national system and for the effectiveness of service delivery and \ndemocratic development at sub-national levels. \n\u2022  According to the Organic Law, the Board of Governors is accountable to its council. \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   83 ", "Annex 1: Summary Outcomes from the Five Dialogues     \n\u2022  Mechanisms to ensure information is disseminated to the public (through public \nmeetings, public boards and other means) are important as are mechanisms to ensure \npublic consultation through public meetings, hearings and planning process, etc. \n \n2.5.  Dialogue 5: Local Administration, Management and Personnel on March 6, 2009 \n \nDialogue 5 addressed those factors that will ensure SNA have the capacity to carry out their \nresponsibilities  and  subsequently  provide  effectiveness  and  efficient  services.  Participants \nfocused  on  the  institutional  function  and  structure  of  the  sub-national  administration,  in \nparticular commenting on the importance of gaining clarity on internal lines of accountability \nbetween the bodies of the SNA, and the lines of accountability between the SNA and the Line \nMinistries;  and  between  commune/sangkat  councils  and  provincial/district  councils.  The \nparticipants spent equal time considering the issues related to structure and transfer of civil \nservants from central to sub-national administrations and the general question of human resource \ndevelopment.  \n \nAgreements: \n\u2022  The roles, responsibilities, communication and work procedures of the councils, \nboard  of  governors,  committees  and  other  key  elements  of  sub-national \nadministrations must be defined before functions and financial resource management, \nhuman resources and physical resources and be effectively transferred to SNA. \n\u2022  The structure of each level of SNA must correspond to the goal/role of the three \nlevels. \n\u2022  CAR, the State Secretariat for Civil Service and the MoI/D&D will work together to \ndevelop the framework for SNA human resource management. \n\u2022  The goal is to create one personnel management system based on a common legal \nbasis, not a completely separate SNA system. \n\u2022  A mechanism needs to be developed to build capacity at the SNA level. \n\u2022  The internal rules and procedures governing the relationships between the council \nand the Board of Governors must be developed. \n\u2022  As  functions  are  transferred  corresponding  line  ministry  personnel  will  be \nredeployed. If the function is assigned to the SNA, the personnel will become staff of \nthe Council. \n\u2022  The goal is to ensure that overall numbers of staff working at the SNA level will not \nincrease. \n \n&\u00b0'\n \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   84 ", " \nAnnex 2 \nGENDER MAINSTREAMING FOR \nSUB-NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS \n ", "Annex 2: Gender Mainstreaming for Sub-National Administrations     \nANNEX 2 \nGENDER MAINSTREAMING FOR  \nSUB-NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS \n \nThe 10-year, 2010-2019, National Program for Sub-National Democratic Development (NP-\nSNDD) clearly outlines that sub-national democratic development could only be effective and \nsustainable when the gender equality issue is adequately addressed.  Furthermore, the NP-SNDD \nrecognizes the importance of gender mainstreaming as one of its Cross-cutting Areas which \nmust be implemented across all five core NP-SNDD Program Areas in order to strengthen \ngovernance, promote public service delivery and contribute to people\u2019s poverty reduction. \n \nThis brief paper presents an overview of the legal and policy framework for promoting gender \nequality,  and  of  the  mechanisms  and  gender  mainstreaming  activities  necessary  for  the \nimplementation of the NP-SNDD. \n \n1.  Cambodia\u2019s Legal and Policy Framework \n \n1.1.  Legal Framework \n \nThe Royal Government of Cambodia has expressed its commitment to the achievement of gender \nequality and the empowerment of women through its endorsement of international declarations \nand conventions which have in turn enhanced the following national legislation and policies: \n \nThe Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia fully acknowledges the equal rights of women \nand  men,  including  human  rights,  equality  before  the  law,  elimination  of  all  forms  of \ndiscrimination, and the right to participate actively in the political, economic, social and cultural \nlife of the nation.  \n \nThe Royal Government of Cambodia\u2019s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, \nEquity and Efficiency - Phase II recognizes increased gender equity as a key component of the \nstrategy. Women are described as \u201cthe backbone of Cambodian economy and society\u201d and it is \nstated that all women are entitled to equal access to health care, education, and skills training, to \neconomic resources and activities, and to decision-making positions at all levels and in all \nsectors. An important achievement has been the recognition of gender equality as integral to the \nmain government reform programmes, namely Public Administration Reform, Legal & Judicial \nReform, Public Finance Management Reform, and Decentralisation & Deconcentration Reform. \n \nThe Strategic Framework for Decentralisation and Deconcentration, approved in 2005, \ndefines  the  main  policies  and  principles  for  guiding  administrative  reform  at  the \nCapital/Provincial  And  Municipal/District/Khan  administrative  levels  and  strengthening  the \nalready  ongoing  reform  at  the  Commune/Sangkat  level  in  accordance  with  democratic \ndevelopment through decentralization and deconcentration. It ensures that \u2018the reform will \nintroduce systems and procedures and ensure that people, especially women, vulnerable groups \nand  indigenous  minorities  can  participate  in  decision-making  at  Capital/Provincial  And \nMunicipal/District/Khan  and  Commune/Sangkat  levels\u2019.  It  also  notes  that  the  \u2018provincial/ \nmunicipal  and  district/khan  councils  will  be  established  by  indirect  elections.  Women \nrepresentatives in the councils at these administrations must be ensured\u2019. \n \nThe  Law  on  Administration  Management  of  the  Capital,  Provinces,  Municipalities, \nDistrict and Khans provides for gender equality in sub-national participation and its provisions \nare elaborated in the NP-SNDD main document. The Organic Law includes many provisions in \nregard to gender equality. It responds to gender equality concerns in appointment, staffing and \nbudgeting, at all levels, and includes provisions for agenda setting and consultation on women's \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   85 ", "Annex 2: Gender Mainstreaming for Sub-National Administrations     \nrights and gender equality issues at sub-national level. Women's and Children Consultative \nCommittees are to be set up under the Capital, Provincial, Municipal, District and Khan Councils.  \n \nThe sub-decree on the roles and responsibilities of the Capital, Provincial, Municipal, District \nand Khan Women and Children\u2019s Consultative Committee has been formulated, along with a \ncapacity development framework to support effective functioning of these newly established \ninstitutions. \n \nNeary Rattanak III \u2013 MoWA\u2019s third Five Year Strategic Plan (2009-2013) consists of Key \nStrategic Areas, including Promoting Women in Governance and Decision-making. A cross-\ncutting Gender Mainstreaming Programme focuses on national policy, sector policies, including \nformulation and monitoring of Gender Mainstreaming Action Plans and the main government \nreform programmes mentioned above. \n \n1.2.   National and Sub-National Mechanisms for Gender Mainstreaming \n \nThe Ministry of Women's Affairs (MoWA) has responsibility for promoting the role and \nstatus of women in Cambodia. MoWA is expected to lead and manage women\u2019s affairs and act \nas a catalyst, facilitator and advocate in encouraging public institutions, civil society and the \nprivate sector to integrate gender equality into their policies and programs. It is also responsible \nfor monitoring and evaluating policies and programs on behalf of Cambodian women, and \nassessing the contributions of women to achieving the Government\u2019s goals. MoWA is a member \nof the National Committee for Sub-National Democratic Development (NCDD), and its sub-\ncommittees and is also leading for gender mainstreaming in the D&D reform.  At the same time, \nother ministries who are also member of NCDD have created Gender Mainstreaming Action \nGroups and Gender Mainstreaming Action Plans accordingly. \n \nThe Ministry of Interior developed a MoI Gender Mainstreaming Strategy that adopts a \nstrategic vision of \u2018equal participation in decentralisation and deconcentration reform by male \nand female citizens and by male and female elected and appointed officials. Women and men \nequally benefit from sub-national policies, decisions, programmes and service delivery\u2019. MoI \nestablished a DoLA Gender Working Group (DGWG) which will facilitate the implementation \nand will monitor closely the progress of the strategy in achieving its objectives and make \nrecommendations for adjustments and advancement. \n \nAt sub-national level, MoWA is represented by Provincial  and  District  Departments  of \nWomen\u2019s  Affairs  (PDoWA  and  DOWA).  Gender  Focal  Points  have  been  designated  in \nprovincial line departments. The Provincial Department of Women\u2019s Affairs is represented in \nthe Provincial Rural Development Committee and the Executive Committee (ExCom) with \nthe mandate to support gender mainstreaming within their province. \n \nWomen and Children\u2019s Consultative Committees will be established under the Provincial and \nDistrict  Councils  in  accordance  with  the  Law  on  Administrative  Management  of  Capital, \nProvinces, Municipalities, District and Khan.  These Committees undertake very important roles \nin enhancing relationships and building the trust between communities and SNA councils as \nwell as in gathering and disseminating information on women and children\u2019s needs. \n \nCommune Women and Children\u2019s Committees (CWCC) were established according to the \nguidelines passed in August 2007 (No. 082/NCDD). They help both with bringing women\u2019s and \nchildren\u2019s issues to the commune council planning process and to encourage Women and \nChildren Focal Points to play this important role. \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   86 ", "Annex 2: Gender Mainstreaming for Sub-National Administrations     \n2.  Mainstreaming Gender in the National Program  \n \nGender mainstreaming in NP-SNDD will involve a holistic approach to strengthening SNA \ninstitutions  and  organizations  by  mainstreaming  gender  throughout  the  Program,  thus \nencouraging not only higher participation of women in SNA, but also establishing men and \nwomen as equally legitimate political actors.  This implies ensuring gender balance of decision-\nmakers in SNAs; having gender-sensitive SNA policies and decisions; and securing equity of \ntheir outcome for women, the realization of their rights and the achievement of gender equality. \nGender-sensitive sub-national governance must have gender equality and social justice at its \ncentre which requires SNAs to recognize the different needs of women and men and to actively \nchallenge gender inequalities in communities. \n \nTo truly ensure that issues related to women are truly mainstreamed it is necessary to take a \ncross cutting approach, ensuring that the principles of gender equality permeate the entire \nProgram. Gender mainstreaming in NP-SNDD will therefore be achieved by effecting change in \nSNA institutions, processes and relationships on three levels: \n\u2022  Individual: \n\u2212  empowering  women  as  citizens  to  exercise  their  rights  and  engage  more \nconcretely in the sub-national governance processes;  \n\u2212  empowering female SNA elected and appointed officials to participate in and \nstrengthen gender-responsiveness of sub-national governance processes; and \n\u2212  raising male SNA elected and appointed officials awareness of gender equality \nand enabling them to incorporate gender-sensitive practices in their work. \n\u2022  Organizational:  \n\u2212  strengthening SNA internal organizational capacity for gender mainstreaming \n(policies, practices, resources); and  \n\u2212  improving external performance (service delivery).  \n\u2022  Institutional: \n\u2212  Strengthening SNAs, communities and civil society to challenge social norms \nthat restrict women from participating in governance, to support engagement of \nwomen in sub-national governance and to advocate for gender-responsive action \nof SNAs. \n \n2.1.  NP-SNDD Gender Mainstreaming Approach \n \nNP-SNDD capitalizes on the entry points and opportunities created in its five core Program \nAreas to increase opportunities for women and ensure that all services they need are available. \nProposed activities will increase women\u2019s and other vulnerable groups\u2019 access to services and \ncontrol over development resources and benefits directed at improving livelihoods. \n \n2.1.1.  SNA Organization Development  \n \nThis Program area will incorporate gender equality and equity standards in SNA institutions and \nincrease inclusiveness in institutions and processes of sub-national governance. \n \nA).   Policy Framework \n\u2022  Incorporate  provisions  from  relevant  international  instruments  (e.g.    CEDAW), \nCambodian laws, national strategies (e.g. Neary Rattanak II) and sectoral plans (e.g. \nGMAPs) in SNA institutional and organizational set up; \n\u2022  Make women's rights (provided for in international instruments and reflected in the \nlocal laws) central to policy making and service delivery;  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   87 ", "Annex 2: Gender Mainstreaming for Sub-National Administrations     \n\u2022  Develop SNA policies and procedures to address all forms of discrimination in sub-\nnational institutions and processes particularly paying attention to rights of women \nand other marginalized groups; \n\u2022  Develop policies and programs that are informed by collecting gender-sensitive data, \nthat take into account the aspirations, interests and perceptions of men and women \nand lead  to equitable distribution of resources (e.g. conducting gender analysis, \nimplementing gender responsive budgeting);  \n\u2022  Develop inclusive policy-making processes for equal participation and contribution \nof male and female elected officials and staff; and \n\u2022  Implement provisions from GMAPs relevant to service delivery with links to and \nsupport from relevant GMAG staff (MoI DoLA, SSCS, MoH, MoEYS, MAFF, etc.) \n \nB).

Review processes \n\u2022  Develop guidelines for conducting gender audit in SNAs to determine SNAs\u2019 (i) \ninternal institutional/ organizational policy and practices, and (ii) external service \ndelivery practices, performance in promoting gender equity and equality; and \n\u2022  Conduct  regular  gender  audits  of  selected  SNAs  at  all  district  levels  to  assess \nprogress,  problems  and  improvements  in  gender-sensitive  service  delivery  and \norganizational gender equality. \n \n2.1.2.  Human Resource Management and Development Systems  \n \nThis program area will incorporate gender equality and equity principles in SNA organization \nand increase inclusiveness in internal SNA processes. \n \nA).  Equal opportunity policies \n\u2022  Develop  human  resources  policies  and  procedures  that  incorporate  existing  legal \ngender equality provisions; give women equal opportunities and ensure they are treated \nequally (equal access to jobs, opportunity to attain positions of authority, etc.);  \n\u2022  Develop HR policies and incentives that ensure that regulations and management of \nall SNA staff conforms with the principles of gender equality; and \n\u2022  Develop key policy and legal instruments that will enable gender equality in SNA \nincluding equal opportunity policy at all levels of organization. \n \nB).  Human resource policies \n\u2022  Develop relevant policy and define functions, responsibilities and accountability for \ngender mainstreaming activities in SNAs; \n\u2022  Conduct  baseline  gender  assessment  of  SNA  by  obtaining  comprehensive  sex-\ndisaggregated  data  on  the  personnel  of  the  SNA  at  all  levels  including  senior \nmanagement, middle management, and professional, technical and support staff; and  \n\u2022  Develop special measures to promote women's entry into sub-national governance \n(e.g.  quota  and  reservation  systems,  incentives,  financial  resources,  capacity \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   88 ", "Annex 2: Gender Mainstreaming for Sub-National Administrations     \nbuilding) and affirmative action policies that favour promotion of women into key \ndecision-making positions. \n \nC.  Incentives for promoting gender equality \n\u2022  Strengthen  gender-mainstreaming  support  mechanisms  and  networks  (e.g.  the \nWomen and Children Consultative Committee, Provincial Department of Women\u2019s \nAffairs and gender working groups of other line offices - similar to GMAGs in line \nministries) within SNAs that are properly trained and resourced to carry out their role \nin  inspiring,  promoting,  implementing  and  monitoring  organizational  gender \nmainstreaming activities; \n\u2022  Define  incentives  for  individuals  to  deliver  on  gender  equality  (assess  staff \nperformance on promoting gender-equality, give awards for men and women 'gender \nchampions', etc.); and \n\u2022  Create  a  working  environment  supportive  of  women  and  men  with  caring \nresponsibilities (flexible working hours, subsidized child-care) to enable them to \nperform in their positions and to reduce absenteeism from work.  \n \nD).   Capacity development \n\u2022  Develop training modules in diversity, which include gender equality; \n\u2022  Develop gender-mainstreaming support mechanisms and networks to carry out their \nrole in gender mainstreaming; and \n\u2022  Train all SNA staff in diversity and gender equality.  \n \n2.1.3.  Transfer of Functions \n \nThis  program  area  will  define  functions  and  responsibilities  relevant  for  coherence  and \ncoordination of gender mainstreaming activities at sub-national level; \n\u2022  Develop necessary legal instruments for the operation of and support to the Women\u2019s \nand Children Consultative Committees (WCCC).  These relevant legal documents \nwill as well define roles, responsibilities, line of accountabilities and procedures for \nensuring and strengthening WCCC inputs into all decision-making;  \n\u2022  Develop procedures for SNA in identifying and defining relevant policies responding \nto gender issues and ensuring gender balance in consultation process; \n\u2022  Identify and transfer functions reflecting requirements/needs of women, children and \nother vulnerable groups to SNAs; \n\u2022  Strengthen inter-governmental linkages and horizontal coordination, and promote \ndirect accountability to citizens; and \n\u2022  Monitor the implementation of gender policies and principles of gender equality and \nequity in transfer of SNA\u2019s personnel.  \n \n2.1.4.  Sub-National Budget, Financial and Property Management Systems \n \nThis program  area will ensure that  men\u2019s and women\u2019s differing needs and priorities are \naccounted for in SNA financial planning and budgeting. Adequate funding will also be provided \nfor gender-sensitive organizational and institutional changes, including gender-focused staff \ncapacity building and gender equality initiatives within SNA and in service delivery. Moreover, \nSNAs will analyze, from gender perspective, the overall impact of the financial, budget and \nasset management systems performance.  SNAs will:  \n\u2022  Develop  procedures  for  performance  budgeting  and  service  delivery  which  will \ninform decision-making (e.g. establishing monitoring systems to assess success in \npromoting gender equality and poverty reduction, promoting scrutiny of budgets by \ncitizens, including poor men and women); \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   89 ", "Annex 2: Gender Mainstreaming for Sub-National Administrations     \n\u2022  Develop and implement gender-responsive fiscal policies, budgeting procedures and \nguidelines at sub-national level (e.g. gender implication statements) informed by \nMoWA\u2019s experience in incorporating gender responsive budgeting in PFM reform \nprogram; \n\u2022  Link fiscal transfers/fund allocation to gender equity, poverty and other indicators to \nensure spending that benefits women as well as other vulnerable groups; \n\u2022  Provide  resources  for  gender-equality  teams/groups  to  carry  out  their  role  in \norganizational and institutional gender mainstreaming; and \n\u2022  Provide funding for both women-specific and gender-mainstreamed program. \n \n2.1.5.  Support Institutions for D&D Reform \n \nThis program area will build a broad base of understanding of the principles of gender equality, \nchallenge gender inequalities in communities and improve women\u2019s rights. SNAs will: \n\u2022  Develop gender-specific curriculum for SNA staff education using existing MoWA \nmanuals (e.g. Gender and analysis training manual, Gender and governance training \nmanual, Manual on advocacy, Manual on monitoring gender priorities at sub-national \nlevel, etc.); \n\u2022  Develop programs for men and women to create a gender-responsive environment in \nSNA institutions through developing knowledge, skills and attitudes of officials on \ngender  equality  (e.g.  strengthening  political  will,  gender  awareness  exercises, \ntraining and mentoring);  \n\u2022  Work  with  communities  and  civil  society  organizations  to  create  shared \nunderstanding  of  what  decentralization  and  democratic  development  means  for \nordinary  women  and  men  in  terms  of  enabling  their  participation  (e.g.  through \ncommunity consultative meetings/groups, public awareness campaigns and practical \ndemonstration of \u2018SNA governance in action\u2019); \n\u2022  Develop campaigns and work actively with communities towards elimination of \nstereotypes associated with women\u2019s and men\u2019s traditional roles in governance; \n\u2022  Promote women\u2019s representation in SNA governance processes to challenge social \nnorms that restrict women from participating in governance and politics;  \n\u2022  Provide incentives/ for men and women 'gender champions' in promoting gender \nequality in SNAs;  \n\u2022  Formulate associations/networks of female SNA officials to support each other\u2019s \nefforts  in  SNAs  (use  lessons  from  Female  Commune  Councils  Network),  and \ndevelop their capacity to monitor and lobby for gender-sensitive policies; and \n\u2022  Identify resources, both financial and human, to formulate and implement gender \u2013\nsensitive policies and to challenge the unequal distribution of assets and resources \nthat  prevents  women  from  engaging  in  sub-national  governance  processes  (e.g. \neducation, health, political participation).  \n \n2.2.  Capacity Building \n \nWhile creating opportunities for women in sub-national administrations to be integrated into the \nfive Program Areas, there remains a requirement to focus on the limited capacity they have with \nregard to experience and knowledge of how to take advantage of these openings.  Thus the \nCapacity Development Plan defines support necessary to ensure women have the requisite skills \nto have their voices heard in SNAs.  \n \n&\u00b0'\nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   90 ", " \nAnnex 3 \nACCOUNTABILITY OF  \nSUB-NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS \n ", "Annex 3: Accountability for Sub-National Administrations     \nANNEX 3 \nACCOUNTABILITY OF SUB-NATIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS \n \nThe implementation of the 10-year (2010-2019) National Program for Sub-National Democratic \nDevelopment brings about the changes from a centralized management system to a decentralized \nand deconcentrated management system which strengthens governance and autonomy of SNAs, \npromotes efficacy of public services and contributes to the effort for reduction of the people\u2019s \npoverty.  These changes will have an impact on the lines of accountability of national and sub-\nnational  agencies.  In  this  respect,  the  NP-SNDD  envisages  the  strengthening  of  the \naccountability lines of SNAs as one of its cross-cutting Program Areas which requires careful \nstudy on the existing organic laws in order to developing relevant regulations, mechanisms and \ndetailed activities for all five NP-SNDD Program Areas.    \n \n1.  Legal Basis for Promoting SNA Accountability \n \nProvisions  relevant  to  SNA  accountability  are  written  in  the  Law  on  Commune/Sangkat \nAdministrative Management, the Law on Administrative Management of Capital, Provinces, \nMunicipalities, Districts and Khans, the Law on Elections of Commune/Sangkat Councils and \nthe  Law  on  Elections  of  Capital,  Provincial,  Municipal,  District  and  Khan  Councils.    To \nimplement  these  provisions, however,  this paper  seeks  to  identify  accountability  gaps  and \nprovides suggestions for additional legal or regulatory measures and mechanisms to strengthen \nSNA lines of accountability. \n \n1.1.  The Elections of Sub-National Councils \n \nThe  Law on Elections of Commune/Sangkat Councils provides for the direct  elections of \ncommune/Sangkat councils by citizens in those respective communes/Sangkats while the Law \non Elections of Capital, Provincial, Municipal, District and Khan Councils provides for the \nindirect elections by the commune/Sangkat councilors.  Both the direct and indirect elections are \nbased on proportional representation.  Candidates must be nominated in the list of one of the \nregistered parties.  The candidate on the top of the candidate list which occupies the most seats \nof the council automatically becomes the chair of that body.   \n \nThis procedure provides power for the political parties in preparing the candidate lists of sub-\nnational councils.  Therefore, it is natural in such circumstances for elected council members to \nfeel accountable to their party, and get involved as well with SNA line of accountability to the \npeople.  This  does  not  mean,  however,  that  this  particular  electoral  process  is  necessarily \nincompatible with sound local governance.  There are similar systems for electing local officials \nthat have produced well-functioning sub-national governments, including in many European \ncountries.   \n \n1.2.  Appointment of Key Sub-National Administration Officials \n \nThe  Law  on  Commune/Sangkat  Administrative  Management  and  Law  on  Administrative \nManagement  of  Capital,  Provinces,  Municipalities,  Districts  and  Khan  provide  for  the \nappointment and replacement of key sub-national officials.  These include the clerk in each \ncommune/Sangkat,  the  governor  and  board  of  governors,  chief  of  finance  and  director  of \nadministration in the Capital, and in each province, municipality, district and Khan.  However, \nArticle 173 of the Law on Administrative Management of Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, \nDistricts and Khan requires that personnel who are appointed to work with the council or \npersonnel who are re-deployed to the council are the personnel of the respective council.  This \nmeans that all appointed personnel to SNAs are accountable to their respective SNA council.  \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   91 ", "Annex 3: Accountability for Sub-National Administrations     \nFurthermore, this Organic Law also requires for the development of a separate statute of SNA \npersonnel in order to promote lines of accountability of those appointed personnel to their \nrespective councils. \n \nBased  on  above  principles  and  relevant  provisions  of  the  Law  on  Commune/Sangkat \nAdministrative Management; the Law on Administrative Management of Capital, Provinces, \nMunicipalities, Districts and Khan; additional legal instruments and guidelines on the working \nrelationship  between  SNA  council  and  board  of  governors,  and  on  council\u2019s  rights  in \nmanagement, supervision and oversight provision to its personnel shall be formulated.  These \npersonnel include staff appointed by the respective council, staff appointed to the council by the \ngovernment and re-deployed staff.  Doing so will ensure SNA council\u2019s accountability to its \nrespective citizens as well as raises the council\u2019s capability to respond to its citizens\u2019 needs.   \n \n1.3.  Respective Roles of the Council and the Executive \n \nThe Law on Commune/Sangkat Administrative Management and the Law on Administrative \nManagement of Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khan provide clear guidance on \nthe respective roles of the councils and the executive.  Councils have sole authority to approve \ndevelopment  plans,  the  budget,  investments,  fiscal  policy  regarding  local  taxes  and  fees, \nmanagement and use of assets, key personnel decisions and internal rules and regulations.  They \nalso are responsible for monitoring and evaluating the performance of the executive.  They may \nnot delegate this authority to the executive. \n \nThe executive generally is charged with implementing council decisions and providing advice \nand guidance to the council in the performance of its duties.  Further, the laws provide that any \ndecision or activity by the Board of Governors or Governor that have not been authorized by the \ncouncil \u201cshall be invalid\u201d. \n \nThis clear and specific separation of the authority and roles of elected officials (the councilors) \nand  the  executive  (mostly  Government  appointees)  provides  a  sound  basis  for  achieving \ndownward accountability in the sub-national administrations. \n \n1.4.  Transparency / Consultation / Access to Information \n \nThere are multiple provisions, especially provisions in the Articles 23, 27, 64 and 70 of the Law \non Commune/Sangkat Administrative Management  and Articles 38, 41, 43, 68 and 166 of the \nLaw on Administrative Management of Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khan \nwhich provide the basis for consultation with citizens, access to information and transparency in \ngeneral.  These include measures that require: \n\u2022  Open council meetings, supported by publication of the calendar of council meetings, \nand other key documents including the agenda and minutes \n\u2022  Specific consultation with citizens in preparing development plans by the council \nitself and/or the Board of Governors, including by a survey \n\u2022  Appointment of committees to advise the council, including a Committee on Women \nand Children\u2019s Affairs, and also on any topic that the council wishes \n\u2022  Selection of a village chief in each village of the communes/Sangkats to serve as \nliaison between the council and the residents \n\u2022  Public dissemination of the annual report on the performance of the sub-national \nadministration \n\u2022  Free availability of key council documents, mostly through public information boards \n\u2022  Dissemination in writing of the duties of the Board of Governors \n\u2022  Appointment  of  a  procurement  committee  to  oversee  the  integrity,  openness, \ntransparency and fairness of all procurements of the sub-national administrations. \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   92 ", "Annex 3: Accountability for Sub-National Administrations     \nThe  Law  on  Commune/Sangkat  Administrative  Management  and  Law  on  Administrative \nManagement of Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khan also give the rights to the \nRGC and SNA councils to formulate and establish additional legal instruments, guidelines, \nmechanisms and measures aiming to promote and strengthen public hearings, public access \nrights to information and transparency.  These include legal instruments and mechanisms for: \n\u2022  Public  hearings,  supported  by  a  requirement  for  advance  publications  of  key \ndocuments, prior to key decisions by the council \n\u2022  Consultation on the local budget \n\u2022  Citizen  and/or  CSO  membership  in  council  committees  by  defining  clear  and \nappropriate roles and not only in a capacity as advisor or observer \n\u2022  Citizen\u2019s \u2018right to access\u2019 information \n \n1.5.   Monitoring / Evaluation \n \nThe  Law  on  Commune/Sangkat  Administrative  Management  and  Law  on  Administrative \nManagement of Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khan authorize the councils to \nfollow-up,  monitor  and  evaluate  the  implementation  of  plans,  programs,  projects  and \nperformance in the delivery of services.  The report also must include a special report by the \nWomen and Children Affairs Committee on issues relevant to their mission and interests.  \nFurther, the councils must adopt the report within 45 days of the conclusion of the budget year \nand make it freely available to the public.   \n \nTogether these measures provide a recurring basis for general oversight by citizens and other \nstakeholders of the performance of the sub-national administrations. \n \nTo  promote  effective  implementation  of  these  legal  provisions,  additional  monitoring  and \nevaluation legal instruments, mechanisms and measures shall require or enable: \n\u2022  The participation of citizens and other stakeholders in the monitoring and evaluation \nprocess, such as through social audits  \n\u2022  Formal audits of local finances by internal and/or external auditors \n\u2022  Public hearings to discuss the findings of the annual monitoring and evaluation report \nand financial audits and the steps the council will take to address problems and \nimprove performance \n \n1.6.   Upward Accountability (or Legality Control) \n \nThe  Law  on  Commune/Sangkat  Administrative  Management  and  Law  on  Administrative \nManagement of Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khan provide broad authority \nto the Minister of the Ministry of Interior to challenge the legality of the acts of the councils to \nensure that Deika (by-laws) and decisions of the councils are in accordance with the constitution, \nlaws and other national regulations.  For instance, the Minister may void the act and/or order the \ncouncil to revise the act.  In addition, the Minister has the authority to monitor the implementation \nof roles and duties and any abuse of power taken place at the sub-national level. \n \nAll else failing and according to the above Organic Laws, the Minister may dissolve the council \nin the case of Communes/Sangkats or request that the RGC dissolve the council in the case of \nthe Capital, Province, Municipality, District and Khan.  The Minister also may issue written \ninstructions to the Communes/Sangkat council to carry out their duties or may take over the \nduties directly until a new council takes office.  Finally, the Minister may initiate the process of \nterminating the appointment of the governor or deputy governor at the request of the council. \n \nAt the same time, the Organic Laws provide that citizens may seek redress when they have been \nadversely affected by acts of the councils. \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   93 ", "Annex 3: Accountability for Sub-National Administrations     \nTo smoothly implement these extensive provisions regarding upward accountability without \naffecting SNA autonomy and SNA accountability to their citizens, NCDD will develop and \nstrengthen  mechanisms  and  measures  for  legality  control  and  intervention  of  the  central \nministries to SNAs by requiring or enabling: \n\u2022  More precise definition to provide greater certainty of the council acts subject to \nreview for legality and of the timing and process for that review  \n\u2022  Measures establishing the scope and substance and the process of monitoring and \nevaluation by line ministries of the performance of functions of the sub-national \nadministration (monitoring of expediency) \n\u2022  Recourse by the councils, either by appeal to the Government or through the courts, \nwhen disagreeing with the central ministry\u2019s decisions to challenge the legality of \ntheir acts and decisions.  \n \n1.7.   Downward Accountability \n \nArticles  11  and  12  of  the  Law  on  Administrative  Management  of  Capital,  Provinces, \nMunicipalities, Districts and Khans mandate that the councils will \u201cestablish, promote, and \nsustain democratic development\u201d including: \n\u2022  \u201cPublic representation; \n\u2022  Local autonomy; \n\u2022  Consultation and participation; \n\u2022  Responsiveness and accountability; \n\u2022  Promotion of quality of life of the local residents; \n\u2022  Promotion of equity; \n\u2022  Transparency and integrity; \n\u2022  Measures to fight corruption and abuse of power.\u201d \n \nArticle 19 provides that \u201ceach council shall represent and act on behalf of all citizens living \nwithin its jurisdiction\u201d.  Article 34 further provides that \u201cthe council shall be accountable \ndirectly  to  all  citizens  for  making  decisions  on  priorities  and  for  ensuring  democratic \ndevelopment within its jurisdiction\u201d. The law also includes a measure making the council \n\u201cresponsible for all decisions and actions undertaken by the committees that were established by \nthe council\u201d (Article 121).  \n \nThese are clear principles and statements establishing the downward accountability of sub-\nnational administrations.  How well they work in practice will depend largely on the resolution \nof issues identified in the prior sections and additional provisions, mechanisms and measures to \nreinforce and enforce downward accountability including: \n\u2022  Provisions requiring action by the council on a specific issue, if supported by a \nspecified percentage of the local community \n\u2022  A requirement that certain key decisions of the council be ratified by referendum  \n\u2022  Provisions providing citizen\u2019s rights to request for the recall of elected  council \nmembers before their term in office by citizens under certain specific circumstances \n\u2022  Provisions of rights of SNA councils to appoint their sub-national administration staff \n\u2022  Provisions requiring public access to information. \n \n2.  The Promotion of SNA Accountability in the National Program \n \nTo  promote  SNA  accountability,  the  NP-SNDD  identifies  four  lines  of  accountability  as \nfollowing:  \n1.  Internal accountability which is within a unit of SNA or among the SNAs own \nentities.  In the context of sub-national democratic development, the strengthening of \nthe internal accountability focuses on the development of mechanisms, procedures \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   94 ", "Annex 3: Accountability for Sub-National Administrations     \nand measures for each tier of SNAs to ensure that the council (the elected) as the \nhighest responsible body in their respective jurisdictions can make decisions based \non their citizen\u2019s needs and priorities, has the means and ability to monitor and guide \ntheir board of governors and other units on the implementation of their decisions.    \n2.  Intra-SNA accountability, which refers to accountability among/between SNAs or \nunits of SNAs, at the same or different levels.  The primary tasks in strengthening \nthis intra-SNA accountability is the promotion, support and accountability of the \nmunicipal/district council to the commune/Sangkat councils in their jurisdiction in \naccordance with the Articles 97, 98 and 100 of the Law Administrative Management \nof Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khan. \n3.  Inter-governmental accountability, which is between the central government, line \nMinistries,  institutions  and  departments  with  SNAs.    Furthermore,  the  inter-\ngovernmental accountability will emerge via the SNA legality control, inspection of \nsectoral technical standards, and administrative and financial audits.    \n4.  Accountability of SNAs to citizens refers to political accountability between SNA \nand citizens in their jurisdiction through the development of mechanisms, procedures \nand measures to ensure citizen\u2019s participation in SNA governance process. \n \n2.1.  SNA Organization Development \n \nThis Program Area of SNA Organization Development (Program Area 1) will be a key locus for \nthe exercise of all four lines of accountability, in the manner as follows: \n\u2022  Internal accountability, via the establishment of rule based administrative systems \nand  reporting requirements; \n\u2022  Intra-SNA  accountability,  particularly  in  respect  to  the  C/S  support  units  to  be \nestablished by the districts and in respect to lines of reporting among/between the \nvarious tiers of SNAs; \n\u2022  Inter-governmental accountability is implied via the horizontal coordination and line \ndepartments in the context of unified administration; and, \n\u2022  Accountability to citizens through (i) surveys of citizen satisfaction with services; (ii) \nIT to increase citizen access to information and services; (iii) guidelines, instructions \nand  instruments  for  consultation,  information  and  participation  of  citizens;  (iv) \ndevelopment of citizens engagement programs and various mechanisms of citizen \ninvolvement. \n \nConcretely,  this  Program  Area  has  a  primary  focus  on  the  development  of  mechanism, \nprocedures and measures to strengthen internal accountability in relation with roles, duties and \nworking relationship between the council\u2019s boards of governors, committees and other units \nimplementing  the  council\u2019s  decisions  with  their  respective  councils,  and  the  intra-SNA \naccountability by placing the focus on working relationship between different tiers of SNAs, \nespecially  between  district  administration  and  commune/Sangkat  administrations  in  the \nrespective district.     \n \n2.2.   Human Resource Management and Development Systems \n \nThe  development  of  the  Human  Resource  Management  and  Development  Systems  will \nemphasize on the lines of accountability of different SNA units, chief of finance, director of \nadministration and board of governors, the monitoring/oversight roles of the respective SNA \ncouncil on management and assignment of SNA personnel by the board of governors and the \ndirector of administration, and the functioning of council\u2019s committees in accordance with the \nLaw on Administrative Management of Capital, Provinces, Municipalities, Districts and Khan, \nparticularly with Articles 119, 154, 155, 157, 162, 163, 184, 190 and 191.

Transfer of Functions \n \nIn the process of Program Area 3 \u201cTransfer of Functions\u201d implementation, inter-governmental \naccountability emerge clearly through the transfer of functions, responsibilities and authorities in \nmanaging resources to carry out those transferred functions.  SNA councils shall have direct \naccountability to their citizens for the implementation of the assigned permissive functions while \nthe citizens shall be provided with rights and information, and encouraged to directly monitor \nand evaluate the performance of SNA. \n \nThe transfer of obligatory functions shall be implemented in accordance with the Law on \nAdministrative  Management  of  Capital,  Provinces,  Municipalities,  Districts  and  Khan, \nparticularly with the provision under Article 225.  Provision of maximum authority to SNA \ncouncil  in  managing  and  implementing  obligatory  functions  as  well  as  authorities  in \nimplementing activities to promote public awareness on roles and responsibilities of SNAs will \nboost SNA accountability to their citizens.  In this respect, central ministries and agencies will \nretain important roles for the development of relevant policies, minimum technical standards, \nprovision of capacity and monitoring on the undertaking of the functions by the SNAs. \n \nIn  order  to  strengthen  inter-governmental  accountability  and  downward  accountability \n(accountability to the citizens), Program Area 3 \u201cTransfer of Functions\u201d will focus on: \n\u2022  Clearly identifying functions, responsibilities and authorities in managing resources \nfor carrying out the functions by types of SNAs; \n\u2022  Identifying roles, responsibilities and authorities to be retained at the national level; \n\u2022  Defining minimum technical standards and capacity needs for specific functions to \nbe transferred; \n\u2022  Defining clear M&E procedures to be conducted by the respective central ministries; \n\u2022  Conducting public awareness programs on roles, responsibilities and authorities in \nmanaging  resources  to  carry  out  the  transferred  functions  as  well  as  roles, \nresponsibilities and authorities to be retained at the national level; \n\u2022  Conducting public forums with concerned citizens on SNA public service provisions; \n\u2022  Conducting Citizen Report Cards on specific services provided by SNAs; \n\u2022  Establishing  accountability  working  groups,  ombudsperson  offices,  feedback \nmechanisms such as feedback boxes, telephone hotlines and other means.  \n \n2.4.   Sub-National Budget, Finance and Property Management Systems \n \nFor this Program Area 4, lines of accountability will be strengthened through the following \nmechanisms: \n\u2022  Internal  accountability  (horizontal)  \u2013  via  internal  audit,  relations  and  processes \nbetween council and Board of Governors (BoG)/Administration in respect to budget \nimplementation; \nNational Program for Sub-National Democratic Development, 2010-2019   96 ", "Annex 3: Accountability for Sub-National Administrations     \n\u2022  Intra-SNA  accountability(vertical  and  horizontal/upward  and  downward), \nparticularly  for  sharing  of  specified  revenues  between  district  and  the \nCommunes/Sangkats within the district; \n\u2022  Inter-governmental  accountability  (vertical/upward)  is  exercised  through  MEF \nfinancial inspections and National Audit Authority (NAA) audits of SNA financial \nperformance; and, \n\u2022  Accountability of SNA to citizens (downward) in respect to budget development, \nchoices,  and  implementation;  public  hearings  related  to  budget,  investment, \ndevelopment issues should be developed, and pilots conducted with respect to social \nauditing,  and  the  possibility  of  inserting  requirements  for  citizens  or  Commune \ncouncils to formally approve budgets as a means of exercising authority over higher \nlevels of government. \n \nIn order to strengthen democratic principles through comprehensive downward accountability \nmechanisms, special attention will be given to enable citizens\u2019, women\u2019s, community vulnerable \ngroups\u2019 and civil society\u2019s organization scrutiny of public spending (e.g. the provision of legal \nrights  to  citizens  requiring  for  public  disclosure  of  finances  and  obtaining  appropriate \nresponses). \n \n2.5.
