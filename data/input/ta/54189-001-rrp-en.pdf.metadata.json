THE PROPOSAL \n \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan \nand (ii) a proposed grant, both to the Republic of Maldives for the COVID-19 Active Response \nand Expenditure Support Program, under the Countercyclical Support Facility (CSF) COVID-19 \npandemic response option (CPRO).1 The report also describes proposed technical assistance \n(TA) for Improved Implementation of the Government\u2019s COVID-19 Response Package, and if the \nBoard approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, \napprove the TA. \n \n  Rapid increase in COVID-19 cases. While the first confirmed case in Maldives was \nrecorded  on  7 March  2020,  the  first  local  transmission  was  confirmed  on  15  April  2020. \nCoronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases spiked since 19 April 2020, with positive cases doubling \nevery 4 days until 2 May 2020. Although the doubling rate has slowed down since then, the cases \ncontinue to increase, with 2035 confirmed cases, 1311 recoveries, and eight deaths as of 14 June \n2020.2 With the health care capacity considered insufficient to deal with a surge of COVID-19 \npatients, the government declared a public health emergency on 12 March 2020, initially for 30 \ndays, and currently extended until 29 June 2020. International travel was restricted, and a \nlockdown was imposed in the greater Mal\u00e9 region, which has been partially eased with effect from \n15 June 2020 as part of phase II measures. \n \n  Timely and relevant program. The proposed program will help the government mitigate \nthe adverse socioeconomic and health impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. It will \nsupport the government\u2019s COVID-19 countercyclical expenditure program and provide critically \nneeded budget support to help the government undertake public expenditures that are essential \nto curtail the spread of COVID-19, supporting poor and vulnerable groups, and provide economic \nsupport for affected businesses. Table 1 summarizes Maldives\u2019 compliance with the access \ncriteria for the CPRO.  \n \nTable 1: Compliance with the Access Criteria for CPRO \nCPRO Access   \nCriteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nAdverse impact  The government estimates that GDP growth in 2020 may fall about 19 percentage points \nof exogenous  from the pre-pandemic estimate of 7.5% to \u201311.3%. Total government revenues will decline \nshocks  by at least half of the 2020 pre-pandemic estimate. The fiscal deficit in 2020 is estimated to \nrise to 13.7% of GDP from the pre-pandemic expectation of 6.2%. ADB estimates that up to \n15.6% of the workers could lose their jobs, and the $3.2/day IPL poverty headcount ratio \ncould increase more than three times from 0.4% in 2018 to 1.3% in 2020. The foreign \nexchange reserves may decline to 2.0 months of goods and non-factor services imports from \n2 .9 months in 2019. \nCountercyclical  The government\u2019s COVID-19 countercyclical expenditure program of $351 million consists of \ndevelopment  (i) COVID-19 pandemic response plan targeting the upgrading and provision of health \nexpenditures  facilities and supplies to support public health ($97 million); (ii) a COVID-19 social protection \npackage for the vulnerable population such as the unemployed, poor and vulnerable \nhouseholds, gender-based violence survivors, and expatriate migrant workers, and subsidies \nto households on electricity and water bills ($124 million); and (iii) a COVID-19 economic \nresponse, providing subsidized working capital to the self-employed and businesses ($130 \nmillion). \nPre-shock record  Macroeconomic management was generally sound before the pandemic struck\u2014with strong \nof sound  growth, low inflation, and an improving fiscal position. Annual GDP growth averaged 6.5% \n \n1  ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n2  Government of Maldives, Ministry of Health. Health Protection Agency COVID-19 Statistics Dashboard (accessed 15 \nJune 2020). ", "2 \nCPRO Access   \nCriteria  ADB Staff Assessment \nmacroeconomic  and average consumer price index inflation was 0.9% during 2016\u20132019. Before the \nmanagement  pandemic, both ADB and the IMF had projected GDP growth to continue on a strong path, \ndriven by continued strong tourism growth. The government has undertaken major public \nfinancial management and tax reforms since 2011. As a result, during 2014\u20132019, the tax\u2013\nGDP ratio averaged 19.4% and the total revenue (excluding grants) was 26.4% as a ratio of \nGDP. The fiscal deficit improved from 10.0% of GDP in 2016 to 5.7% in 2019. The finance \nsector remains broadly sound. The government is committed to macroeconomic stability and \nhas an ambitious reform agenda centered on sustaining growth.a  \nStructural  The government took credible and proactive precautionary steps in its COVID-19 response \nreforms  before the first confirmed case in Maldives. As part of its precautionary steps, the government \nestablished a COVID-19 Task Force for overall pandemic response planning and monitoring, \nand a National Emergency Operations Centre to oversee the activities of stakeholder \nagencies. A COVID-19 Response Trust Fund Committee was set up, with the finance minister \nas chair, for the oversight, and management of unemployment benefits, subsidies on \nelectricity and water bills to households, and the government\u2019s economic response through \nsubsidized working capital loans. Lockdown measures were implemented, and international \nborders were closed. Under its COVID-19 pandemic response plan ($97 million), the \ngovernment  will  enhance  its  capacity  for  COVID-19  tests,  quarantine,  isolation,  and \ntreatment.   \nDebt  In 2019, the total PPG debt\u2013GDP ratio was 76.9%. ADB\u2019s DSA expects the PPG debt\u2013GDP \nsustainability  ratio to peak at 96.5% in 2020 and eventually fall to 78.8% by 2025 as the government \ncommits to reprioritize and cut capital expenditure in the short term and fiscal consolidation \nin the medium term. The IMF and ADB assessments concur that debt is sustainable, but \nMaldives continues to be at high risk of debt distress, with most debt indicators expected to \nfall within the thresholds before 2030.b ADB\u2019s lending constitutes less than 0.5% of GDP in \n2020. Compared with borrowing from international markets, external assistance from ADB, \nAIIB, the World Bank, OFID, IFAD, and IsDB would reduce the debt\u2013GDP ratio by 1.3\u20131.6 \npercentage points during 2020\u20132025. \nCoordination with  ADB has closely coordinated with the IMF, with regular exchange of information, including \nthe IMF  joint IMF-World Bank-ADB meetings on 23 March and 14 April 2020. ADB shared updates \nabout the proposed program with the IMF, and the IMF incorporated the program in its \nassessments. On 22 April 2020, the IMF approved a $28.9 million RCF for Maldives.

PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n1.  COVID-19 Crisis and the Health System Constraints \n \n  Unprecedented global crisis. On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization \n(WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. On \n11 March 2020, WHO characterized the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic.3 The COVID-19 \n \n3  World Health Organization (WHO). Rolling Updates on Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) (accessed 12 May 2020). \n ", "3 \ninfection has spread to 216 countries, areas, or territories, with 7,690,708 confirmed global cases \nand 427,630 deaths as of 14 June 2020.4 Social distancing, lockdowns, border restrictions, and \nhigh levels of uncertainty are resulting in a significant drop in demand for goods and services, \nupsetting the logistics segment, and disrupting global value chains in supplier countries. The \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), in its April 2020 projection, estimated global growth in 2020 \nto fall to \u20133.0%, a downgrade of 6.3 percentage points from its January 2020 estimate. The decline \nis more severe for advanced economies, at \u20136.1%.5  \n \n  Health system in Maldives. Government health spending in Maldives was 6.5% of gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in 2017\u2014much higher than its South Asian and Southeast Asian peers, \nwhich spend 3%\u20134% of GDP on public health.6 However, the country is deficient in specific health \nsector capacities needed to contain and manage COVID-19. For instance, in March 2020, it only \nhad 97 ventilators nationwide, which is likely to be inadequate if the virus were to spread further. \nAn estimated 200 critical care beds may be required against the 35 available. Maldives did not \nhave a molecular laboratory capable of testing for and detecting the COVID-19 virus when the \nfirst positive case was detected in March 2020.7 Most islands have basic health care facilities but \nare not equipped to handle COVID-19 cases. Although Maldives has almost 23 doctors per \n10,000 people,8 which is only slightly below Luxembourg (29 doctors per 10,000 people) and the \nOrganisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  average  (32 doctors  per \n10,000 people),9 almost 44% of health care professionals are in the capital city, Mal\u00e9.10   \n \n  Maldives has 1,192 islands (188 inhabited) spread over 90,000 square kilometers (km2), \nof which 298 km2 island. However, 38% of the country\u2019s population of about 550,000 lives in Mal\u00e9, \nwhich is just about 2 km2 and is among the most densely populated cities in the world.11 The \nskewed population distribution not only compounds the community transmission risk in Mal\u00e9 but \nalso makes the health service provision in the islands more expensive. The principal means of \ntransport by sea is often influenced by weather conditions and is relatively expensive, making the \naccessibility, and affordability of health care services a difficult issue for many Maldivians. \n \n2.  COVID-19 Impact to the Economy \n  \n  Dependence on tourism. While the tourism industry in Maldives directly accounts for \nabout 25% of GDP, it stimulates other economic activity in businesses and trade, construction, \nand transport. The combined contribution of the industry to GDP is about 75%.12 Tourism \nrevenue\u2014which includes the tourism goods and service tax, green tax, tourism land rent, and \nlease period extension fee\u2014accounts for about 35% of the total government revenue. If tourism\u2019s \nindirect effect on other sectors is included, the tourism-dependent revenues comprise about 50% \nof the total. The COVID-19 related disruption in tourism activities will lead to a decline in GDP \ngrowth and cause higher fiscal stress in 2020.  \n \n \n4  WHO.

This is the best-case scenario (scenario 1), where the \ngovernment assumes that tourism will resume by July 2020. In the worst-case scenario, when \nresumption happens in January 2021, tourist arrivals in 2020 are estimated to decline by 78.0% \nand GDP by 29.7% compared with 2019 (scenario 3). Unless otherwise specified, scenario 1 has \nbeen used for all assessments. \n \nTable 2: COVID-19 Impact on GDP Growth, 2020 \n  Expected  Total  Tourist Arrivals  Tourist  GDP   \n  Border  Tourist  in 2020   Arrival  Growth  Nominal \n  Reopening  Arrivals  (after lockdown  Growth  Rate  GDP \nScenario   Month  2020  is lifted)  (%)  (%)  (Rf billion) \nScenario 1  July 2020  845,546  462,868  (50)  (11.3)  81.3 \nScenario 2  October 2020  625,082  242,404  (63)  (17.7)  75.6 \nScenario 3  January 2021  382,678a  0  (78)  (29.7)  64.5 \n( ) = negative, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, GDP = gross domestic product.  \na Tourist arrivals in 2020 before lockdown.  \nSource: Government of Maldives. \n \n  Significant fiscal pressure. The government estimates that its annual revenue in 2020 \nwill drop by half of its pre-COVID-19 budget estimate to $991 million. Even after a 20% reduction \nin expenditure over 2020 budget estimates (Table 3), the fiscal deficit\u2013GDP ratio will rise to 13.7% \nin 2020 from 5.7% in 201913 and 6.2% (2020 budget estimate). There is a serious downside risk \nand the deficit may rise to 22.9% of GDP in the worst-case scenario (scenario 3). The government \nis severely resource constrained, and the additional financing requirements to meet COVID-19 \nrelated expenditures are estimated at $450 million in addition to the budgeted deficit in 2020. \n \n  High  external  vulnerabilities.  Merchandize  exports,  particularly  of  tuna  fish,  are \nexpected to drop as all of Maldives\u2019 leading export destinations are suffering from the COVID-19 \ncrisis, but imports are expected to fall more as both tourist arrivals and investments decline \nsharply. The IMF estimates the current account deficit to decrease from 26.1% of GDP in 2019 to \n23.1% of GDP in 2020. With foreign direct investment inflows declining from 15.5% of GDP in \n2019 to 6.0% expected in 2020, the overall external balance will fall to \u20137.2% of GDP from 0.7% \nin 2019. As a result, gross international reserves coverage, in months of goods, and non-factor \nservices imports, is expected to decline from 2.9 months in 2019 to 2.0 months in 2020.14 \n \n  Sectoral  impact  and  job  losses.  According  to  April  2020  estimates  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the maximum decline in sectoral GDP is in transport services, hotels, \nrestaurants and related services, and the agriculture sector.15 On the other hand, job losses are \nexpected  to  be  the  highest  in  agriculture,  businesses  and  trade,  and  construction,  and \nmanufacturing. Job losses could reach 11,000\u201327,000 under ADB\u2019s current smaller shock and \nlarger shock scenarios, translating into an unemployment rate of 6.3% (smaller shock) and 15.6% \n(larger shock), as a proportion of the employed.16  \n \n13 Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA).

No interest will be \ncharged during the grace period. The schemes are subject to the condition that \nsuch businesses will not lay off or force local employees to go on unpaid leave.  \n \n  Finance sector risks and monetary response. The impact of COVID-19 on Maldives\u2019 \ncapital markets will be low, as the markets are nascent.35 Banks make up the dominant segment \nin the finance sector, with credit to the private sector from banks at Rf24.5 billion (28% of GDP) \nin 2019.36 However, about 70% of banks\u2019 lending is to the tourism industry, which is under stress. \nWeak asset quality in the banking industry before COVID-19 at the end of 2019 (9.4% of total \nloans) will be exacerbated. This will be mitigated to an extent by the scheme for subsidized \nworking capital under the COVID-19 response package and the introduction of a 6-month \nmoratorium on loan repayments for affected businesses. The reduction of banks\u2019 minimum \nreserve requirement from 10% to 5% by the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) will provide \nadditional liquidity. Despite this release, liquidity pressure is expected as moratoriums take effect \nand banks are unlikely to receive new deposits.

Macroeconomic Management and Debt Sustainability \n \n  Sound  macroeconomic  management.  Maldives  has  consistently  maintained  high \neconomic growth, averaging 7.2% annually during 1980\u20132015, primarily backed by development \nin tourism, fishing, and construction.37 More recently, during 2016\u20132019, annual GDP growth \naveraged 6.5% and consumer price inflation remained low at 0.9% (footnote 13). Before the \npandemic, both ADB and the IMF had projected GDP growth to accelerate in 2020 and continue \non a strong path in the medium term. During 2014\u20132019, the tax\u2013GDP ratio averaged 19.4% and \nthe total revenue (excluding grants) was 26.4% as a ratio of GDP. A further increase in tax \nrevenues was projected in 2020 before the pandemic, with the introduction of personal income \ntax and amendments to the airport service charge and development fee. The fiscal deficit shrank \nto 5.7% of GDP in 2019 from 10.0% in 2010, but the current account deficit remained high at \n26.1% of GDP in 2019.  \n \n  Since 2011, Maldives has undertaken substantial, and fast-track reforms to widen its tax \nbase, with assistance from ADB. These reforms include (i) introducing new taxes (goods and \nservices tax, a green tax, a business profit tax, and personal income tax); (ii) establishing a \nrevenue  authority;  and  (iii)  system  modernization  (footnote  37).  Some  public  financial \nmanagement (PFM) reforms have been undertaken for improved planning, budgeting, monitoring, \naccounting, and transparency (para. 35). The government is taking welcome steps to improve \ngovernance, transparency, and resilience to climate change. It is committed to macroeconomic \nstability and has an ambitious reform agenda for sustaining growth.38  \n \n  On the monetary side, the MMA has maintained an accommodative stance in recent years \nas credit grew faster than nominal GDP growth while the overall inflationary pressures remained \nlow. The local currency is pegged to the United States dollar. The foreign exchange rationing to \nbanks sometimes triggers a foreign exchange shortage that has led to an active parallel market. \nThe MMA is also working with the IMF to improve its policy transmission through gradual de-\ndollarization and the adoption of a more appropriate exchange rate regime. \n \n  Debt  sustainability.  In  its  April  2020  debt  sustainability  assessment  (DSA),  after \nconsidering the effect of COVID-19 and including the proposed program,39 the IMF assessed \nMaldives\u2019 public debt as sustainable but at a high risk of debt distress. Debt sustainability is \nsubject to rapid recovery in growth and the committed actions by the authority to reprioritize and \ncut  capital  expenditure,  medium  term  fiscal  consolidation,40 and  active  debt  management \n(footnote 14). ADB\u2019s DSA uses more conservative assumptions than the IMF, based on the most \nrecent government estimates of a bigger economic contraction and higher primary deficits.41 \nUnder the baseline scenario, public debt is expected to rise from 76.9% in 2019 to 96.5% in 2020 \n \n37 ADB. 2017.

IMF Country Report. No. 19/156. Washington, DC. \n39 ADB program\u2019s loan amount considered by the IMF in its assessment was a $27.8 million loan, based on the financing \nproposed earlier by ADB. This almost matches the $25 million revised loan amount considered now. IMF assessment \ndid not include the grant of $25 million in this proposed program. \n40 See para.18 on the recent reforms undertaken. The 2013 Fiscal Responsibility Act sets out some quantitative fiscal \ntargets and procedural rules to achieve fiscal stability and sustainability, improve the fiscal transparency, and \nincrease the accountability of the government. \n41 ADB\u2019s assessment assumes a lower GDP growth rate (-11.3% real, -8.0% nominal) as compared to IMF\u2019s (-8.1% \nreal, -5.9% nominal) and lower primary balance (-11.1% of GDP) as compared to -10.1% of GDP assumed by IMF. \nDebt Sustainability Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "9 \nbefore declining to 88.8% in 2021 and 78.8% by 2025. Stress tests show that debt ratios will be \nelevated but display medium term downward trends. While the debt path is slightly higher than in \nthe IMF assessment, ADB\u2019s assessment yields the same conclusion as the IMF\u2019s\u2014that public \ndebt is sustainable but at high risk of debt distress, with most debt indicators expected to fall within \nthe thresholds before 2030. ADB loan constitutes less than 0.5% of GDP and does not jeopardize \nthe country\u2019s debt sustainability. On the contrary, compared with borrowing from international \nmarkets,  concessional  financial  assistance  from  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  OPEC  Fund  for \nInternational Development, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the Islamic \nDevelopment Bank would reduce the debt\u2013GDP ratio by 1.3\u20131.6 percentage points in the \nprojection period until 2025. External public and publicly guaranteed debt will also rise but is \nsustainable  in  the  medium  term.  Rollover  risks  from  the  repayment  of  two  outstanding \ninternational sovereign bonds of $350 million are mitigated by the accumulation of liquid assets \nin the Sovereign Development Fund. The risk of high external debt distress is further mitigated by \nan effort to obtain concessional loans and grants to the extent possible. The government is \nreviewing the debts from bilateral partners to benefit from the G-20 debt service suspension \ninitiative.42 The government is currently not considering negotiating with multilateral financial \ninstitutions for debt suspension since those loans are mostly concessional. \n \nB.  Proposed Program and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n  The CARES Program will provide budget support to the government for implementing its \ncountercyclical expenditure program for mitigating the adverse social and economic impact of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, the program will support the government in improving the \nresilience  of  its  health  systems  against  infectious  diseases,  and  implementing  social  and \neconomic  measures  for  the  vulnerable  population  and  affected  businesses  (para.16).  The \nproposed program builds on ADB\u2019s strong partnership with Maldives. ADB initiated dialogue with \nthe government and other development partners for a coordinated response to the pandemic \nbefore  the  first  case  was  reported  in  Maldives.  It  conducted  multiple  consultations  with \nstakeholders to strengthen the gender and socioeconomic aspects of the government program.  \n \n  ADB\u2019s comprehensive package of support to Maldives for COVID-19 related health \nmeasures includes (i) a $500,000 grant from the Asia Pacific Disaster Response Fund, approved \non 26 March 2020; and (ii) the allocation of a $798,000 grant from the TA on Regional Support to \nAddress  the  Outbreak  of  Coronavirus  Disease  2019  and  Potential  Outbreaks  of  Other \nCommunicable Diseases43 to procure medical supplies and personal protective equipment.  \n \n  The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, including operational priorities on \naddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (para. 37), accelerating progress in \ngender equality (para. 38), strengthening governance and institutional capacity (para. 35), and \nfostering regional cooperation and integration (para. 26).44 The program is also aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s national strategy, the Strategic Action Plan (SAP), 2019\u20132023; priorities on the \nenhancement of community resilience under the pillar of Jazeera Dhiriulhun (quality of island life), \nand  improvement  of  independent  institutions  and  public  service  under  the  pillar  of  good \ngovernance.45  \n \n  The proposed program is aligned with the preparation of Maldives\u2019 country partnership \n \n42 The People\u2019s Republic of China announced on 8 June 2020 that it had suspended debt repayments for 77 developing \ncountries  as  part  of  the  G-20  debt  relief initiative  (https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjbxw/t1787197.shtml). \nUnconfirmed reports indicate that Maldives is included. \n43 ADB. 2020.

ADB will provide support under the South Asia Subregional Economic \nCooperation Program to (i) make the subregional economy more resilient to the pandemic by \nenhancing the subregional supply chain through transport and trade facilitation, and (ii) sharing \ninternational good practices with the customs administrations of member countries to facilitate the \nentry of critical imports of COVID-19 related medical supplies and equipment.49 ADB will also \nsupport the mutual learning of South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation countries on \nCOVID-19 response and recovery, including international travel restoration, through the TA on \nSupporting Knowledge Solutions for New Development Strategies in South Asia.50  \n \n  Coordination with the International Monetary Fund and other development partners. \nADB has held several consultations with the World Bank, the IMF, the Asian Infrastructure \nInvestment Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, and United Nations agencies on possible \ncoordination for the emergency support to Maldives.

For the remaining \nfinancing gap of $241.2 million, the government is considering a combination of the following \noptions: (i) further expenditure cuts to reduce the funding shortfall, (ii) assistance from other \ndevelopment  partners,  (iii)  domestic  borrowings,  and  (iv)  sovereign  bond  issuances  in \ninternational markets. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  The  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  will  be the  executing  agency  for  the  program.  The \nimplementing agencies are the Ministry of Health, the MGFSS, and the Ministry of Economic \nDevelopment. The COVID-19 Trust Fund Committee (Table 1) will approve all expenses and \nprovide an oversight function for its relief and recovery package.53 The Fiscal Affairs Department \nof the MOF will function as the secretariat to the committee; and will coordinate with the Ministry \nof Health, the MGFSS, and the Ministry of Economic Development for the implementation of the \nprogram. For transparency in expenditure related to the government\u2019s COVID-19 response, the \nMOF is posting regular online updates of the budget utilization.54 The MOF will also provide \nquarterly reports to ADB on the progress achieved and the expenditures incurred from the \ngovernment\u2019s budget to support the measures under its countercyclical expenditure program. The \nprogram implementation period is from March 2020 to June 2021 including the prior actions \ninitiated since March 2020. The proceeds of the loan will be withdrawn as a single tranche \nimmediately  after  loan  effectiveness,  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n  Attached TA will support the government in effective monitoring and evaluation, and \ntargeting of the government\u2019s COVID-19 response package, and identify areas for further PFM \nreforms that can be supported by ADB under a subsequent program.55 The transaction TA is \nestimated  to  cost  $500,000,  which  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-6).56 The government will provide counterpart support in the form \nof staff, office, administrative and logistics support, translation, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n53 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n54 Government of Maldives, Ministry of Finance.

Consultants  will  be  recruited  in  accordance  with  ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated staff instructions. \nTA funds will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n  Governance. ADB\u2019s interim country partnership strategy 201657 noted that while Maldives\u2019 \nPFM systems have shown signs of improvement, government inefficiency, and weak institutional \ncapacity remain critical constraints. PFM system weaknesses include poor budget credibility and \nexecution stemming from poor planning, weak project appraisal and selection, and the absence \nof capital budget ceilings. These weaknesses result in frequent cost overruns and delays in \nimplementation.58 The government\u2019s PFM reform action plan was updated in January 2018 with \nWorld Bank support and has formulated three broad PFM reform goals: (i) strengthening fiscal \ndiscipline; (ii) ensuring debt sustainability; and (iii) efficient, transparent, and modern management \nof public finances. The World Bank PFM Strengthening Project for Maldives aims to strengthen \nthese areas.59 Some improvements to the PFM systems are: (i) a fiscal strategy statement is \nproduced annually; (ii) medium term capital spending projections are provided; (iii) an integrated \nfinancial management information system has been implemented; and (iv) appropriation rules \nhave been introduced with effect from the 2020 budget to enhance credibility.   \n \n  The prevalence of corruption in the public sector is perceived as high, based on global \ncorruption indicators.60 Reform projects are under way to improve procurement, oversight, and \naudit.61 The MOF prepares and publishes on its website consolidated weekly and monthly fiscal \ndevelopment reports, monthly cash flow reports, and quarterly economic, and fiscal development \nreports. The MOF\u2019s state internal audit committee is committed to increase the accountability and \ntransparency of COVID-19 related expenses by conducting a special audit.62 The program \nexpenditure will be subject to external audit by the Auditor General\u2019s Office. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \n  Poverty  and  inequality.

In terms of expenditure inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, \nMaldives\u2019 Gini coefficient of 31.3 is mostly in line with other countries in the region.63 However, \nthe $5.50/day IPL poverty headcount ratio could almost double from 5.6% in 2018 to 10.5% in \n2020. Moreover, people in the outer atolls may be more affected because poverty is unequally \ndistributed across Maldives, with higher poverty rates in the outer atolls.64 The government\u2019s \nCOVID-19 response package will help mitigate COVID-19\u2019s impact through timely and effective \nhealth and social assistance measures that shield the poor and vulnerable population\u2014especially \nvulnerable women, the elderly, and differently abled persons\u2014against price and income shocks.  \n \n  Gender. The program is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. The government\u2019s \nCOVID-19 response package will expand the social assistance programs for poor and vulnerable \ngroups as follows: (i) 1,500 vulnerable households registered with the National Social Protection \nAgency and headed by single, widowed, divorced, or differently abled women will be reached \nthrough the cash assistance program during the pandemic emergency period; (ii) 15,000 migrant \nworkers will be transferred to safer accommodation consisting primarily of prefabricated housing \nunits in greater Mal\u00e9, with separate accommodation for women; (iii) women and differently abled \napplicants will receive priority benefits from the unemployment allowance within a reduced 2-week \napproval  time;  (iv)  women-led  enterprises  (18%  of  all  applications)  will  benefit  from  the \ngovernment\u2019s provision of working capital for MSMEs, with disbursement within a reduced              \n2-week approval time; (v) isolation beds will be provided in five regions, with separate wards for \nmen and women; (vi) at least five accommodation blocks will be made operational for survivors \nof GBV in Mal\u00e9 and the outer atolls (to provide temporary protection and support for women \nescaping GBV); and (vii) additional benefits will accrue to households from the government\u2019s \nelectricity and water subsidies. A gender specialist will be located at the MGFSS to liaise with the \nMOF to ensure effective monitoring of the gender-related targets in the program. \n \n  Safeguards. In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the program \nis classified category B for environment, C for involuntary resettlement, and C for indigenous \npeople\u2019s safeguards. An assessment of the potential environmental and social impacts and risks \nassociated with the government\u2019s COVID-19 countercyclical expenditure program has been \nundertaken as described in the safeguards assessment matrix.65 There are no anticipated \nimpacts related to involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. There are no anticipated \nsignificant impacts on environment, but the installation of the mostly prefabricated housing units \nintended as temporary shelter for migrant workers may trigger standard construction related \nenvironmental impacts and risks. These units will be set up on vacant government land with \nexisting water, sewage, and electricity connections; and solid waste treatment arrangements. \nStandard construction related environmental impacts and risks will be addressed following the \nMaldives  Environmental  Protection  Regulations,  2012,  and  through  the  requirements,  and \nmitigation measures agreed with the government, as set out in the Safeguard Assessment Matrix. \nThe attached TA will support the government in ensuring compliance with these requirements \nand mitigation measures. It will also support external monitoring and verification of government \nmonitoring of the environmental management and mitigation measures (footnote 55).  \n \n  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan.66 \n \n63 World Bank.

The government estimates about 50.0% decline in tourist \narrivals in 2020 from the pre-pandemic expectation if the borders are opened \nin July 2020. Correspondingly, the GDP growth in 2020 is estimated to decline \nfrom a pre-pandemic estimate of 7.5% to \u201311.3%, and with a serious downside \nrisk. In the worst-case scenario, which assumes that borders will be opened in \nJanuary 2021, the tourist arrivals can decline by 78% with a corresponding \ndecline in GDP by 29.7%.  \n \nFall in tourism earnings will add to the fiscal stress. Tourism revenue, \nincluding earnings received from tourism goods and services tax, green tax, \ntourism land rent, and lease period extension fee, accounts for around 35% of \ngovernment revenue. If tourism\u2019s indirect effect on other sectors is included, \nthe tourism-dependent revenues comprise about 50% of total government \nrevenue. If the decline in tourist arrivals continues for an extended period, the \ngovernment estimates that its annual revenue in 2020 is likely to drop by half \nof  its  pre-COVID-19  budget  estimate  to  $990.9  million.  Even  with  strict \nexpenditure  rationalization  and  reduction  by  almost  20%  from  budget \nexpenditure in 2020, the fiscal deficit in 2020 will rise to 13.7% of GDP (from \n5.7% in 2019) even after rationalization of non-priority current and capital \nexpenditure. The government is severely resource constrained. The additional \nfinancing requirement to meet COVID-19-related expenditures is $450 million \nover and above the budgeted fiscal deficit in 2020.  \n \nHigh external vulnerabilities. Merchandize export, particularly of tuna fish, is \nexpected to drop as all of Maldives\u2019 leading export destinations\u2014Thailand, \nGermany, United Kingdom, United States, and France\u2014are suffering from the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, imports are expected to fall more as both \ntourist arrivals and investments decline sharply. Consequently, the current \naccount deficit is estimated to decline from 26% of GDP in 2019 to 21% in 2020 \nbut the overall balance will worsen to \u20137.1% of GDP in 2020 (from 0.7% of GDP \nin 2019). As a result, gross international reserves coverage, in months of \ngoods, and non-factor services imports, is expected to decline from 2.9 months \nin 2019 to 2.0 months in 2020 (IMF).  \n \nImpact on the job market. The disruption in economic activities has affected \nthe labor market. In terms of sector, job losses are expected to be the highest \nin agriculture, businesses and trade, and construction, and manufacturing. It is \nestimated that job losses could be in the range of 11,000 to 27,000 under ADB\u2019s \ncurrent smaller shock and larger shock scenarios for the impact of COVID-19 \non Maldives\u2019 economy.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  25 \nCARES Program\u2019s   \nCriteria and   \nIndicators  ADB Staff Assessment \nImpact on migrant workers. Migrant workers constitute about 88% of the \nworkforce in construction and more than 50% in the tourism and hotel industry, \nthe sectors hit by the pandemic. Most of the migrant workers, who otherwise \nwork in shifts, have lost their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic and are now \ncompelled to live in extremely congested conditions. Out of the reported \npositive COVID-19 cases, two-thirds are non-Maldivians, and more than half \nare from Bangladesh. While the government has taken steps to support the \nmigrants, including opening a dedicated clinic on Hulhumal\u00e9\u2019 island, near the \ncapital Mal\u00e9, much needs to be done to ensure safer living conditions for \nmigrant workers. \n \nImpact on poverty. With an assumed reduction in per capita consumption \nexpenditure by 20% under COVID-19 related restrictions, ADB estimates that \nthe $3.2/day IPL poverty headcount ratio will increase more than three times \nfrom 0.4% in 2018 to 1.3% in 2020. The $5.5/day IPL poverty headcount ratio \nwill almost double from 5.6% in 2018 to 10.5% in 2020. \n \nImpact on women. Women will be affected more in the current pandemic as \naround 40% of them (compared to about 30% men) are in the informal sector \nwith no job security. According to a survey done by the UN Women\u2019s Regional \nOffice for Asia and the Pacific (ROAP) in April 2020, 26% of women engaged \nin informal work said that they lost their jobs. In the health sector, 90% of the \nnurses are women and vulnerable to COVID-19 infection risk as frontline \nworkers. Women are also vulnerable to increased domestic violence (GBV), \nwhich has been found to increase during every type of emergency. 14 cases of \nviolence against women were formally submitted to the Ministry of Gender, \nFamily, and Social Services (MGFSS) during 15 April 2020 to 12 May 2020. \n2.  Countercyclical  The government has introduced (i) countercyclical expenditure program (the \ndevelopment  COVID-19 response package) focused on addressing the immediate needs of \nexpenditures  the poor and vulnerable, and business for 3 months while stepping up the \nhealth sector response, and (ii) monetary measures for improved liquidity and \nmaintaining financial and exchange rate stability. \n  \nThe government\u2019s countercyclical expenditure program of $351 million consists \nof (i) COVID-19 pandemic response plan targeting upgradation and provision \nof health facilities and supplies to support public health ($97 million); (ii) \nCOVID-19 social protection package for the vulnerable population such as the \nunemployed,  poor,  and  vulnerable  households,  gender-based  violence \nsurvivors, and expatriate migrant workers, and subsidies to households on \nelectricity and water bills ($124 million); and (iii) COVID-19 economic response \nproviding subsidized working capital to the self-employed and businesses \n($130 million). \n3.  Pre-shock record  Maldives has consistently maintained a high economic growth, averaging 7.2% \nof generally  annually during 1980\u20132015, primarily backed by development in tourism, and \nsound  fishing, and construction. More recently, annual GDP growth averaged 6.5% \nmacroeconomic  during 2016\u20132019. Before the pandemic, both ADB and the IMF had projected \nmanagement  GDP growth to accelerate in 2020 and continue on a strong path in the medium \nterm, driven by continued strong tourism growth. During 2014\u20132019, the tax to \nGDP ratio averaged 19.4% and the total revenue (excluding grants) was 26.4% \nas ratio of GDP. Further increase in tax revenues was projected in 2020 before \n ", "26  Appendix 4 \nCARES Program\u2019s   \nCriteria and   \nIndicators  ADB Staff Assessment \nthe pandemic with the introduction of personal income tax and amendments to \nairport service charge and airport development fee. From 2016 to 2019, \nconsumer price inflation remained low averaging 0.9%. The fiscal deficit went \nup to 10.0% of GDP in 2016 as the government launched a few major \ninfrastructure  projects  and  as  a  result,  the  current  account  deficit  also \nexpanded to 23.5% of GDP that year despite strong tourism receipts. Since \nthen, the fiscal deficit had shrunk to 5.7% of GDP in 2019, but the current \naccount deficit remained high at 26.1% of GDP in 2019. The finance sector \nremains broadly sound.  \n \nSince 2011, Maldives has undertaken substantial, and fast-track reforms to \nwiden its tax base with assistance from ADB, which include: (i) introduction of \nnew taxes (goods and services tax [GST], green tax, business profit tax, and \npersonal income tax); (ii) establishing a revenue authority; and (iii) system \nmodernization. In particular, a general GST regime was implemented within \nonly one month from the presidential ratification of the empowering law.a A \nnumber of public financial management (PFM) reforms have been undertaken \nfor improved planning, budgeting, monitoring, accounting, and transparency. \nThe IMF and World Bank are helping the government develop a new PFM \nstrategic plan. The IMF acknowledges that the government is taking welcome \nsteps to improve governance, transparency, and resilience to climate change, \nand its commitment to macroeconomic stability and ambitious reform agenda \nfor sustaining growth. \n \nOn the monetary side, MMA has maintained an accommodative stance in \nrecent years as credit grew faster than the nominal GDP growth while the \noverall inflationary pressures remained low. The local currency is pegged to \nthe United States dollar. The foreign exchange rationing to banks sometimes \ntriggers foreign exchange shortage that has led to an active parallel market. \nMMA is also working together with the IMF to improve its policy transmission \nthrough gradual de-dollarization and adoption of a more appropriate exchange \nrate regime to maintain price stability.  \n4.  Structural  The government initiated its COVID-19 response preparations even before the \nreforms  first  case  was  detected  in  Maldives.  On  3  March  2020,  as  part  of  its \nprecautionary steps, the government established a COVID-19 Task Force \nincluding representatives from the Ministry of Health (MOH), President\u2019s Office, \nMinistry of Tourism (MOT), Ministry of Defense, Maldives Police Services, and \nother  government  agencies  for  overall  pandemic  response  planning  and \nmonitoring. It established a National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) at \nthe National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) to oversee the activities \nof stakeholder agencies. The government declared a public health emergency \non 12 March 2020, initially for 30 days, and currently extended until 29 June \n2020. International travel was restricted and a lockdown imposed in the greater \nMal\u00e9\u2019 region until 11 June 2020. On 20 March 2020, a COVID-19 Response \nTrust Fund Committee was set up for the oversight and management of \nunemployment benefits, subsidy on electricity and water bills to households, \nand the government\u2019s economic response through subsidized working capital \nloans. The committee is chaired by the finance minister and has representation \nfrom the Ministry of Economic Development (MED), MOT, and MMA.  \n \nWhile the government implemented social distancing norms and closed public \nspaces and offices, it also closed its international borders for tourists. The \n ", "  Appendix 4  27 \nCARES Program\u2019s   \nCriteria and   \nIndicators  ADB Staff Assessment \ngovernment took proactive decision to access support from WHO, the UN \nagencies, and other regional governments.  \n5.  Debt  ADB\u2019s CPRO policy paper advises the following in Appendix 1 para. 1(v) \u201cIn \nsustainability  the case of the CPRO, the expansion of eligibility to include group A DMCs \nmeans that many will be at high or moderate risk of debt distress. To be eligible \nfor CPRO support, all DMCs must be able to demonstrate that the assistance \nprovided by ADB will be integrated into a fiscal framework that does not \njeopardize the borrower\u2019s debt sustainability or exacerbate weaknesses in \nfiscal sustainability.\u201d  \n   \nIn its April 2020 DSA after considering the effect of COVID-19, and including \nADB\u2019s  CARES  Program,  the  IMF  assessed  Maldives\u2019  public  debt  as \nsustainable but at high risk of debt distress subject to rapid recovery in growth \nand the authorities' commitment to reprioritize and cut capital expenditures and \nactive  debt  management  including  accumulation  of  liquid  assets  in  the \nSovereign Development Fund.  \n \nADB\u2019s  DSA  uses  more  conservative  assumptions  based  on  revised \ngovernment estimates. In 2019, the total PPG debt-to-GDP ratio was 76.9%. \nADB\u2019s DSA expects the PPG debt-to-GDP ratio to peak at 96.5% in 2020 and \neventually fall to 78.8% by 2025 as the government commits to reprioritize and \ncut capital expenditure in the short term and fiscal consolidation in the medium \nterm. The IMF and ADB assessments concur that debt is sustainable but \nMaldives continues to be at high risk of debt distress with most debt indicators \nexpected to fall to within the thresholds before 2030. ADB\u2019s lending constitutes \nless than 0.5% of GDP in 2020. Compared to borrowing from international \nmarkets, external assistance from ADB, AIIB, World Bank, OFID, IFAD, and \nIsDB would reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio by about 1.3\u20131.6 percentage points \nduring 2020\u20132025. \n \nExternal PPG debt will also rise but is sustainable in the medium term. The \nexternal PPG debt-to-GDP ratio will be a little over 50% in 2020 as the country \nborrows more externally than domestically. The external debt sustainability \nindicators  breach  their  thresholds  under  the  baseline  scenario,  but  are \nexpected to fall to within the thresholds before 2030.b Rollover risks from the \nrepayment of two outstanding international sovereign bonds of $350 million are \nmitigated by accumulation of foreign exchange resources in the SDF. The risk \nof  high  external  debt  distress  is  further  mitigated  by  an  effort  to  obtain \nconcessional loans and grants to the extent possible. \n6.  Coordination  ADB has been in close contact with the IMF on the ongoing measures to \nwith the IMF  respond to the COVID-19 pandemic including joint IMF-World Bank-ADB \nmeetings on 23 March 2020 and 14 April 2020. ADB, World Bank, IMF, IsDB, \nand other UN agencies, such as UNICEF, UNDP, and IOM held several \nconsultations on possible coordinated support for Maldives.  \n \nADB has closely coordinated with the IMF with regular exchange of information, \nincluding joint IMF-World Bank-ADB meetings on 23 March and 14 April 2020. \nADB  shared  updates  about  the  proposed  CPRO  with  the  IMF  during \nconsultations, and the IMF incorporated ADB program in its assessments. On \n22 April 2020, the IMF approved a $28.9 million Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) for \nMaldives.
