The value of innovative strategic knowledge solutions and global best practices are \naccepted  as  critical  factors  for  socioeconomic  advancement.  For  Kazakhstan,  this  is \nunderscored in the country\u2019s Strategy 2030 and Vision 2050.1 The country partnership strategy \n(CPS),  2012\u20132016  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  establishes  demand-based \nknowledge  products  and  services  as  important  tools  with  which  ADB  can  add  value  to \nKazakhstan\u2019s development.2 These strategy documents highlight the need for Kazakhstan to \neffectively apply knowledge solutions and adopt global best practices so as to become a more \ndiversified,  competitive,  and  inclusive  economy  and  go  beyond  the  middle-income-country \nstage. \n \n2.  Against this background, and recognizing ADB\u2019s role as  a knowledge management \nleader in Asia and the Pacific and for Kazakhstan to share its own impressive development \nexperience with other developing countries, the government and ADB agreed to establish the \njoint Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program (KEEP) in 2013. The KEEP is designed to \nfacilitate a range of strategic knowledge options and global best practices that will enable \nKazakhstan to respond to current and emerging development opportunities and challenges in a \nwell-informed and timely manner.  \n \n3.  The  KEEP  is  defined  in  a  memorandum  of  understanding  (MOU)  between  the \ngovernment and ADB.3 The MOU provides the framework (outlining the objective and scope, \nareas of focus, implementation arrangements, and monitoring and evaluation measures) and \ncommits the parties to share the cost of a range of knowledge and experience-sharing activities \nduring 2013\u20132015 with total financing of $2.5 million. The KEEP MOU is in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s  participation  in  the  KEEP  will  be  through  several  technical  assistance  (TA) \noperations.  The  KEEP  will  be  equally  cost-shared  by  ADB  and  the  government.  It  will \ncommence in 2013 with an estimated cost of $500,000. Financing of the KEEP will increase to \n$1.0 million per annum during 2014\u20132015 with ADB providing $500,000 and the government \nproviding the other $500,000 annually.

ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s review \nof the last CPS for Kazakhstan (2002\u20132004) recommended ADB to scale up demand-based knowledge products and services \nand establish a rapid response framework to support crucial policy advisory services.  \n3  The MOU was signed by ADB\u2019s Vice President, Operations 1, and the Minister of Economy and Budget Planning on 18 June 2013.  \n ", "2   \n \n5.  This proposed policy and advisory TA will finance Phase 1 of the KEEP in 2013. As the \nTA is innovative, and the first of its kind in ADB where a developing member country cost-\nshares a knowledge-sharing partnership on a cash basis, lessons drawn from Phase 1 will \nguide the preparation of the subsequent phases. Details of the TA were discussed and agreed \nbetween ADB and the government in line with the project design and monitoring framework in \nAppendix 1.4    \n \nII.  ISSUES \n6.  Since 1991, Kazakhstan has transitioned rapidly from a low-income country into an \nupper-middle-income country and has rated highly in many socioeconomic indicators. Building \non its impressive socioeconomic performance, the rapid transformation and acceleration into \nbeing among the top 30 most progressive countries by 2050 entails new opportunities as well as \nchallenges. Innovative strategic knowledge options and global best practices are called for to \nhelp  the  country  (i)  become  a more  inclusive  and  diversified  economy,  (ii)  develop  better \ninstitutional and policy mechanisms, (iii) integrate and cooperate better with other countries in \nthe region, and (iv) enhance the competitiveness and efficiency of the economy. \n \n7.  Despite  impressive  socioeconomic  performance,  Kazakhstan  faces  a  number  of \ndevelopment challenges. These include  \n(i)  a narrow economic base, mainly concentrated on the extractive industries, calling \nfor diversification;  \n(ii)  an aging and limited infrastructure network requiring significant improvement;  \n(iii)  a vulnerable finance sector needing innovative approaches to reform;  \n(iv)  gaps in institutional and policy development performance requiring reforms and \ncapacity strengthening to enhance efficiency;  \n(v)  an expanding disparity gap demanding growth to be more inclusive;  \n(vi)  limited competition in the economy demanding urgent private sector development \nto enhance competitiveness; and  \n(vii)  rapid expansion in regional and global integration, calling for better-informed \nresponses to maximize gains. \n \n8.  While  capital  investments  are  important  to  address  these  and  related  development \nissues, a combination approach or the effective use of innovative strategic knowledge solutions \nand global best practices is critical for optimal outcomes. The government recognizes the value-\naddition for Kazakhstan\u2019s socioeconomic advancement and has integrated knowledge solutions \ninto  its  Strategy  2030  and  Vision  2050.  These  two  key  development  directives  highlight \nKazakhstan\u2019s demand for knowledge solutions and use of global best practices for it to become \na more diversified, competitive, and inclusive economy. ADB and other development partners \nhave been requested by the government to facilitate knowledge and global best-practice sharing \nin a concerted and timely manner. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of this TA will be enhanced policy formulation capacity of the government to \nsupport  its  medium  and  long-term  development  strategies.  The  expected  outcome  will  be \nstrengthened government capacity and awareness of best practices in the selected areas.  \n                                                \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 April 2013. \n ", "3 \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  As part of the KEEP, this TA will support subprojects at the macro, sector, and thematic \nlevel that facilitate or promote knowledge solutions, capacity development, and exchange of \nglobal  best  practices.  Because  of  the  dynamic  and  unforeseeable  nature  of  government \ndemand for knowledge products and advisory services, the subprojects of the TA and the \nimplementation  approach  will  be  flexible  in  order  for  the  TA  to  effectively  respond  to  the \ncountry\u2019s urgent requirements in a timely manner.  \n \n11.  The subprojects to be financed will therefore remain tentative to accommodate that \nflexibility\u2015to provide the scope for adjustment and allow for quick response. While some of the \nsubprojects  have  been  discussed  between  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Budget  Planning \n(MEBP) and ADB during the KEEP preparation, other subprojects will be firmed up during TA \nimplementation. A tentative list of the KEEP Phase 1 subprojects is in Supplementary Appendix \nB. \n \n12.  The criteria for selecting a subproject would be that it (i) supports priority government \npolicy reforms and is consistent with the CPS; (ii) is related to implementation of the government \ndevelopment strategy; (iii) is considered as an emerging, urgent, and high-priority area where \nADB can add value; (iv) shows evidence of strong government ownership; and (v) complements \nor synergizes the knowledge support of ADB and other development partners. \n \n13.  The main outputs of the TA will be under the categories of policy advisory and capacity \ndevelopment  and  include  (i)  submission  of  analytical  reports  to  the  government,  and  (ii) \ncompletion of a capacity development program.  \n \n14.  Effective  coordination  of  the  executing  agency  with  stakeholders  is  important  for \nsuccessful implementation of the TA. It is assumed that there will be (i) consistent government \ndemand for ADB\u2019s knowledge products and services, (ii) effective coordination by the MEBP in \nleading the subproject selection and review process, (iii) strong collaboration and support from \nall relevant stakeholders, and (iv) reliable and accurate data and information are made available. \nThe potential risks are that (i) lack of coordination between development partners may lead to \nduplication  of  activities,  and  (ii)  frequent  changes  in  government  priorities  may  result  in \nineffective use of policy recommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, of which the entire amount will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources). After ADB \napproval of the TA, the government will reimburse ADB 50% of the TA cost by depositing \n$250,000 into the TASF account. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The  Ministry  of  Economy  and  Budget  Planning,  through  the  Investment  Policy \nDepartment, will be the executing agency and will be responsible for supervising and monitoring \nTA  activities.  Implementing  agencies  will  be  those  ministries  or  agencies  responsible  for \ninitiating the specific subprojects. \n \n17.  The KEEP Coordinating Committee (KCC), comprising representatives from the MEBP \nand ADB, will be set up to oversee implementation and provide guidance and direction to \nstakeholders. The KCC will have periodic meetings to update and adjust the list of subprojects \n ", "4   \n \nand core outputs. The two parties will record agreements reached during the meetings and \nattach an updated subproject list with detailed project outline and specific terms of reference for \nadditional  subprojects.  The  vice-minister  of  the  MEBP  and  the  country  director  of  ADB\u2019s \nKazakhstan Resident Mission will review and endorse the subprojects and proposed financing \nplan.  \n \n18.  The KCC Secretariat will support the KCC\u2019s work in ensuring the smooth functioning of \nthe  committee  and  supervise  and  coordinate day-to-day  TA  activities,  including monitoring \nprogress,  resolving  issues,  arranging  meetings,  and  liaising  with  concerned  agencies.  An \noverview of the KCC and its secretariat is in Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \n19.  Monitoring  of  the  TA  (Phase  1)  will  be  results  oriented.  A  main  measurement  for \nsubproject outcome is to see if recommendations emanating from the TA are used by the \ngovernment. Monitoring will be done by the KCC through its secretariat. The KCC Secretariat \nwill coordinate closely with all agencies carrying out the subprojects and ensure issues arising \nare addressed at an early stage. Under the overall direction and guidance of the KCC, the KCC \nSecretariat shall prepare quarterly progress reports and a TA completion report. The final \nevaluation  of  the  TA  will  be  based  on  performance  indicators  outlined  in  the  design  and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1).  \n \n20.  Good  practices  and  lessons  will  be  disseminated  by  the  KCC  through  reports  and \nworkshops and will also be posted on the ADB and government websites. The KCC will ensure \nthat  these  good  practices  and  lessons  are  adequately  reflected  in  subsequent  KEEP \nsubprojects, and related government and ADB operations.  \n \n21.  Implementation of the TA will be over a 12-month period, commencing in July 2013 and \nclosing in July 2014. As subprojects are identified during implementation, flexibility  will be \nmaintained in the engagement of consulting services. Where there is need for single source \nselection,  this  will  be  coordinated  with  Operations  Services  and  Financial  Management \nDepartment (OSFMD). Engagement of all consultants under the KEEP will be in line with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements will \nbe in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n \n22.  For the identified subprojects (Supplementary Appendix B), about 6 person-months of \ninternational consultancy services and 12 person-months of national consultancy services are \nenvisaged. Additional consultants will be recruited to carry out well-defined tasks during TA \nimplementation. Given the nature of the activities to be undertaken, specific terms of reference \nfor the consultants will be prepared as soon as the subprojects are finalized. The KCC will \ndiscuss  and  finalize  the  required  expertise  and  detailed  terms  of  reference  of  specific \nassignments, including duration and expected results. The generic outline on the scope of work \nto be carried out by the consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a reimbursable \nbasis, as discussed in para. 15, to the Government of Kazakhstan for the Joint Government of \nKazakhstan and the Asian Development Bank Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program, \nPhase 1, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact   From 2017 government uses  Asian Development  Assumption  \ncutting-edge knowledge and  Outlook \nEnhanced policy  Consistent \nglobal best practices in \nformulation capacity of  Government annual  government demand \nformulating and implementing \nthe government to  work reports  for ADB\u2019s knowledge \nits key development strategy \nsupport its medium-  products   \nor policy measures   Policy statements \nand long-term \n \ndevelopment strategies      \nReports from \nacademia, think-\ntanks, development \npartners, and media  \nOutcome   By July 2014:     Assumption \nStrengthened  Recommendations emanating  Government  Effective coordination \ngovernment capacity  from the TA are reflected or  documents and  by MEBP in leading \nand awareness of best  referenced in national or  statements on policy  the subproject \npractices in the  sector plans or policy actions   directions  selection and review \nselected areas  process \n   \nRisks \nProceedings of \ndialogue with the  Lack of coordination \nexecuting and  between development \nimplementing  partners may lead to \nagencies and other  duplication of activities \nagencies \nFrequent changes in \n  government priorities \nmay result in \nineffective use of \npolicy \nrecommendations \nOutputs      Assumptions  \n1.
