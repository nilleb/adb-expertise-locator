In December 2003, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), in consultation with the Ministry \nof Agriculture, Water Resources, and Processing Industry (MAWRPI), initiated a concept paper \nto study pricing systems and cost-recovery mechanisms for irrigation in the Kyrgyz Republic. \nThe study was subsequently supported for funding by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund. \nThe Fact-Finding Mission visited the Kyrgyz Republic in June 2004 to formulate the technical \nassistance (TA), and reach an understanding with the Government on the TA goal, purpose, \nscope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The  agriculture  sector  has  grown  consistently  since  1996,  with  an  average  annual \ngrowth rate of about 7.4% (1996\u20132002), compared with 4.7% for the economy as a whole. The \nsector  accounts  for  35%  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP),  employs  about  52%  of  total \nworkforce, and accounts for about 11% of exports (2002). \n \n3.  About 66% of the country\u2019s population lives in the rural areas and is dependent on \nagriculture  for  its  livelihood.  Seventy-five  percent  of  the  country\u2019s  arable  land  has  been \nreallocated. Arable land represents about 7% of the territory, of which 64% relies on irrigation to \nenable production. Irrigation is by far the largest water use, accounting for about 90% of the \ntotal.  \n \n4.  In 2003, 40.8% of the population lived in absolute poverty, down from 44.4% in 2002. \nNutrition-based  poverty  declined  from  17.8%  in  2000  to  9.4%  in  2003  (Country  Strategy \nProgramming Update, July 2004). Rural poverty declined over 1998\u20132001, largely due to the \nbetter performance of the agriculture sector and higher average real wages. However, rural \npoverty continues to be significantly higher than urban poverty, with about three quarters of the \npoor living in rural areas. This is due to the effects of the transition process and particularly to \nlimited rural economic opportunities. Regional differences in poverty are significant. Much of the \npopulation lives close to the margin between poor and nonpoor, thus creating a significant \ndegree (about 39% in 2001) of transient poverty. \n \n5.  The  Government  has  introduced  a  number  of  measures  to  improve  deteriorating \ninfrastructure and to generate long-term growth in agriculture. The Law on Water (January \n1994) covers water rights, water resources policy, planning and management, tariff setting, \ninformation system and dissemination, and inspection authorities. The law is being replaced by \na new water code, which is being considered by the Parliament. The draft water code provides \nfor  several  changes  in  how  water  is  managed  and  controlled.  The  Law  On  Water  User \nAssociations (WUAs) (February 2002) provides general provisions governing them, and their \nrights  and  responsibilities,  including  rights  to  establish  and  collect  water  charges,  retain \nrevenues, and make decisions on operation and maintenance (O&M), distribution of water, and \nimprovement of on-farm irrigation systems within the WUAs\u2019 jurisdiction. The WUAs are a \nmeans of facilitating the collection of water delivery charges and service fees, and enhancing \nthe efficiency of water use. \n \n6.  The  Department  of  Water  Resources  (DWR)  is  responsible  for  administering  all \nagricultural water resources. The regional DWR has a comprehensive role in the administration \nof irrigation water, including operation of the main systems and reservoirs; design, construction, \n                                                 \n1\n The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 February 2004. ", "2 \nand rehabilitation of canals and structures; drainage and land reclamation; establishment and \nadministration of water quotas; control of the irrigation system; and selling water to farms. The \ndistrict DWR is responsible for coordinating all local government activities, including irrigation \nwater management and negotiation of water supply contracts. The district officers report to the \noblast  DWR,  which,  in  turn,  reports  to  the  minister  and  governor  of  the  region.  Village \ngovernments  have  mixed  roles  and  functions,  including  collection  of  water  fees  and \nadministration of irrigation.  \n \n7.  DWR  has  insufficient  resources  to  provide  a  comprehensive  system  of  water \nmanagement from the watershed to the farm head gates due to the following:  \n \n(i)  The Republican budget is limited and the Government is substantially dependent \non budget support from the European Union Food Security Program.  \n(ii)  The water fee of Som0.03 per cubic meter, if fully collected, would only cover \nabout 30% of O&M requirements.  \n(iii)  Parliament sets the water fees, although this is proposed to change under the \ndraft water code.  \n(iv)  While about 80% of water fees are collected annually, only about 30% are in \ncash, making it difficult for DWR to sell in-kind contributions, such as labor and \nmaterials for O&M works. \n \nThe  drainage  and  irrigation  system  has  thus  been  deteriorating,  lowering  productivity  and \nagricultural growth. The rapidly changing farm structure makes it difficult for DWR and the \ndecentralized departments to administer water quotas and irrigation regimes to these small farm \nunits. As drainage and irrigation facilities deteriorate, poverty will increase as farmers\u2019 incomes \ndiminish. \n \n8.  WUAs are being required to take more responsibility for O&M and capital investment. \nUnder the World Bank\u2019s On-Farm Irrigation Project and ADB\u2019s Agriculture Area Development \nProject, drainage and irrigation systems are being rehabilitated, with WUAs required to fund all \nO&M and 25% of rehabilitation costs. WUAs will be required to improve the drainage and \nirrigation infrastructure to suit the changing ownership and structure of farms. WUAs could \nbecome responsible for inter-farm infrastructure, particularly as DWR has insufficient resources \nfor O&M of off-farm infrastructure. Pricing and cost-recovery practices vary among WUAs and \ninclude volumetric, based on the quantity of water used, and flat rates, based on area irrigated. \nSome WUAs combine both. The method used must provide for fair and equitable charges and \nfacilitate the efficient use of water. \n \n9.  A comprehensive study of water cost, O&M of drainage and irrigation, and pricing and \nrecovery of costs to ensure a sustainable drainage and irrigation system is timely given (i) \ndeteriorating infrastructure; (ii) importance of irrigated agriculture to rural livelihoods, particularly \nthe poor; (iii) limited resources for O&M; (iv) current state of WUAs\u2019 development; and (v) \ncurrent and proposed investments in rehabilitation by ADB and the World Bank. The study will \nreview the situation, focusing on the cost of supplying irrigation water, and on the ability and \nwillingness of WUAs and farmers, particularly the poor, to recover capital investment and O&M \ncosts. While poor farmers are not necessarily significantly disadvantaged in terms of land \nownership and farm size,2 they may have more marginal land on the perimeter of the irrigation \n                                                 \n2\n Another Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund-financed study will more closely examine land issues: ADB. 2004. \nTechnical Assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for A Study of the Impact of Land Reform on Agriculture, Poverty \nReduction, and Environment. Manila.  ", "3 \nsystem with variable water supply, have less access to inputs and credit, and, therefore, more \ndifficulty in increasing productivity and profitability of their farm than more affluent farmers. Low \nirrigation charges can disadvantage the poor as they have no incentive to use water efficiently. \nAvailability of and access to water can decline, the less poor often receive less than their share, \nand, consequently, incomes decline. A pragmatic approach to pricing and cost recovery of \ninvestment and O&M expenses\u2014which also takes account of local socioeconomic, political, and \ninstitutional circumstances, and of the difference in farm size, income level, and gender\u2014is \nessential to ensure that the income and livelihood, especially of poor farm households, are not \nsubstantially adversely affected, and to ensure the sustainable use of scarce water resources. \nThe study will identify alternative pricing and cost-recovery mechanisms that will be realistic for \npoor users but also ensure efficient and sustainable use of water. The study is expected to not \nonly serve the Kyrgyz Republic but also be relevant to other countries, particularly in Central \nAsia, in determining and recommending pricing schemes and cost-recovery mechanisms for \ndrainage and irrigation systems. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The goal is to improve the sustainability and equity of drainage and irrigation services, \nparticularly  for  poor  farmers.  The  purpose  is  to  identify  and  formulate  appropriate  pricing \nsystems and cost-recovery mechanisms that reflect the ability and willingness of farmers to pay. \n \n11.  The TA will have four outputs: (i) current cost and revenue of drainage and irrigation \nservices will be determined, (ii) ability and willingness to pay for water and drainage and \nirrigation  services  assessed,  (iii)  a  set  of  alternative  pricing  systems  and  cost-recovery \nmechanisms for irrigation infrastructure investment and O&M suitable for WUAs developed, and \n(iv) information gathered disseminated.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA is a detailed study of the legislation and institutional framework, cost of water \nand off-farm and on-farm drainage and irrigation services, and mechanisms for cost recovery, \nincluding various pricing systems used, ability of Government and users to pay, and willingness \nof users to pay. Recommendations appropriate to socioeconomic circumstances will be made to \nsupport  the  adoption  of  efficient  and  effective  pricing  and  cost-recovery  mechanisms  that \naccommodate differing ability and willingness to pay among farmers, particularly the poor. \n \n13.  The study will select up to four drainage and irrigation systems in the north and south to \nprovide  a  representative  sample  of  various  systems,  including  gravity  and  pump  systems, \nrehabilitated and non-rehabilitated systems, and effective and ineffective WUAs. A broad-based \nparticipatory approach involving all levels of government, WUAs, nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs), funding agencies, and users will be adopted to ensure widespread involvement and \nagreement to the analysis and recommendations. The participatory approach will be pursued \nthrough the establishment of a multi-stakeholder study coordination group, extensive group \ninterviews,  a  comprehensive  and  in-depth  survey,  and  local  and  national  seminars  and \nworkshops.  \n \n14.  The key activities will include the following: \n \n(i)  Review the key literature on pricing systems and cost-recovery mechanisms in \nrelevant  countries;  and  key  policy  documents  and  legislation  of  the  Kyrgyz ", "4 \nRepublic,  including  various  decrees,  Law  on  Water,  Law  on  Water  User \nAssociations, and draft water code, to determine the current legal framework and \nidentify any issues. \n(ii)  Analyze DWR costs and revenues from the national to village levels to determine \nthe ability to fund off-farm O&M. \n(iii)  Review the development of WUAs under the On-Farm Irrigation Project and \nAgriculture  Area  Development  Project  to  identify  the  various  practices  with \nrespect to pricing systems and cost recovery mechanisms. \n(iv)  Conduct a field survey of up to four drainage and irrigation systems to determine \nthe costs of water, O&M, and capital investment. The survey will include at least \ntwo  systems  under  either  the  On-Farm  Irrigation  Project  or  Agriculture  Area \nDevelopment Project. The survey will provide information on the key elements \nthat influence the ability and willingness to pay for irrigation water and how they \ncan be addressed. Pricing systems will be evaluated for their appropriateness \nand  implementation  effectiveness.  For  each  system,  WUAs\u2019  capacity  to \nundertake repair and maintenance will be assessed in terms of availability of and \naccess  to  required  machinery  and  equipment,  and  arrangements  within  the \nWUA. The survey will be quantitative and qualitative. \n(v)  Based on the results obtained from activities (i) to (iv), alternative pricing systems \nand cost-recovery mechanisms will be formulated and proposed to remove the \nkey constraints on willingness and ability to pay, and take into consideration the \nfinal beneficiaries\u2019 real ability to pay. The costs and benefits of each alternative \nwill be identified and evaluated. \n(vi)  The  survey  methodology  and  study  results  will  be  discussed  with  the  main \nstakeholders. The results will be disseminated as widely as possible through \nworkshops and seminars. A public awareness campaign will be prepared to \nencourage the irrigation water users of the need and importance of adopting \nappropriate  cost-recovery  mechanisms  for  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the \nirrigation systems. The results of the study will be used to prepare the second \nagriculture area development project scheduled for 2006. \n \n15.  The final step in the TA will be the publication of the study in English and Russian, with a \nsummarized version in Kyrgyz, in appropriate forms and mediums to maximize its distribution. \nAn outline of the study report is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The  total cost  of  the TA  is  estimated  at  $375,000,  comprising  $152,400  in  foreign \nexchange and $222,600 equivalent in local currency. ADB will finance $300,000 equivalent \ncomprising the entire foreign exchange cost and $147,600 equivalent of the local currency \ncosts. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund and \nadministered by ADB. The Government, through the provision of counterpart staff, office space \nand facilities, data and documents, and participation of the study working group, would finance \nin-kind the remaining portion of the local currency costs equivalent to $75,000. See Appendix 3 \nfor the cost estimates and financing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The Executing Agency will be MAWRPI. It will form a study coordination group chaired \nby the deputy minister of DWR, with representatives from the Ministry of Finance, projects ", "5 \nfunded by the World Bank and United States Agency for International Development (USAID),3 \nNGOs, WUAs, and ADB; and the study team leader. Other relevant agencies can participate as \nrequired.  The  study  coordination  group  will  report  to  the  minister  of  MAWRPI,  and  meet \nregularly to provide feedback and guidance on the study process and working papers. \n \n18.  Up to 7 person-months of international consultant services will be required from an \nagricultural economist (team leader, 3 person-months) and water resources manager (2 person-\nmonths),  with  2  person-months  unallocated.  Up  to  36  person-months  of  local  consulting \nservices, as required, will be recruited in water resources management (deputy team leader, 6 \nperson-months),  WUAs  (6  person-months),  legal  services  (4  person-months),  agricultural \neconomics  (6  person-months),  and  social  and  gender  analysis  (6  person-months).  The \nunallocated 8 person-months are to accommodate extensions of the above expertise or to \nrecruit expertise identified during the course of the study. An international consulting firm will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, using the quality- and \ncost-based  selection  method  and  biodata  technical  proposals,  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 4. Consultants will purchase equipment, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \n \n19.  At least six workshops and seminars will be conducted to obtain feedback from the \nvarious  stakeholders  and  to  discuss  the  study\u2019s  findings  and  outcome.  These  will  be \ndisseminated through a public awareness campaign via various media, and through a CD-\nROM,4 maintained in MAWRPI, compiling the consultants\u2019 work. \n \n20.  The TA will commence about December 2004 and be implemented over 6 months. An \ninception report for the study will be prepared at the end of the first month, followed by a \nmeeting  of  the  study  coordination  group.  The  inception  report  will  outline  the  study,  and \nsummarize the literature and legislation reviews, the participatory approach being adopted, \nselection of systems, survey methodology, and a study schedule. An interim report will be \nsubmitted at the end of 3 months. A draft final report will be submitted at the end of 5 months, \nfollowed by a national workshop. Following the workshop and comments by all stakeholders, the \nfinal report will be submitted. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to the Government \nof the Kyrgyz Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation \nFund for the purpose of The Study on Pricing Systems and Cost-Recovery Mechanisms for \nIrrigation, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n3\n Recently USAID started implementing a regional project to support WUA development in the Kyrgyz Republic, \nTajikistan, and Uzbekistan. \n4\n Compact Disk-Read Only Memory.

Terms Of Reference \n \n6.  The specific terms of reference of the consultants are the following: \n \n1.  Study Framework \n \n7.  To  develop  a  basic  framework  for  the  TA study,  the  consultants  will  carry  out  the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Agree with the Government on the structure, function, and terms of reference of \na study coordination group, which will work closely with the consultants in guiding \nand  advising  on  local  issues,  and  which  will  include  broad  stakeholder \nrepresentation from the grass-roots level, including farmers, representatives of \nWUAs, and local government officials. \n(ii)  Develop the overall methodology for the study and, in conjunction with the study \ncoordination group, select up to four drainage and irrigation systems in the north \nand the south of the Kyrgyz Republic, which will provide a representative sample \nof various systems, including gravity and pump systems, and will include at least \ntwo  systems  under  the  World  Bank  On-farm  Irrigation  Project  and/or  ADB \nAgriculture Area Development Project. \n(iii)  Hold a seminar with the study coordination group to define objectives, processes, \nanticipated outcomes, and time frame. \n(iv)  Hold subsequent seminars with the working group to support the contributions \nrequired from this group. ", "Appendix 4  13 \n(v)  Conduct broad-based workshops at key stages of the study to consider study \nfindings and provide feedback on the main issues. Mid-stage workshops may be \nconducted regionally, and a final national workshop will consider the consultants\u2019 \ndraft final report. \n \n2.   Agriculture Sector Overview \n \n8.  To develop an agriculture sector overview, the consultants will \n \n(i)  review agriculture performance of 1991\u20132003; \n(ii)  review  policy  reforms  and  agriculture  development,  particularly  relating  to \ndrainage and irrigation; \n(iii)  assess key legislation, including various decrees, Law on Water, Law on Water \nuser  Associations,  and  draft  water  code,  to  determine  the  current  legal \nframework and identify any issues; and \n(iv)  identify weaknesses in the policy and legislative framework. \n \n3.   Institutional Arrangements \n \n9.  To determine the appropriate institutional arrangements for sustainable drainage and \nirrigation services, the consultants will undertake the following activities: \n \n(i)  Outline the current institutional framework and responsibilities of agencies for \ndrainage and irrigation. \n(ii)  Concisely  analyze  the  roles  of  the  Department  of  Water  Resources  (DWR) \nclearly distinguishing between central, oblast, and raion levels, and identifying \nthe lines of management, financial control, and reporting. \n(iii)  Concisely analyze the roles and responsibilities of WUAs and village councils in \nmanaging irrigation and drainage. \n(iv)  Review the development of WUAs under the On-Farm Irrigation Project and the \nAgriculture Area Development Project, particularly the charters, decision-making \nprocess for determining water fees and charges, dispute resolution procedures \nfor nonpayment; participation of women in decision making, etc. \n(v)  For each selected irrigated system, assess the capacity of WUAs to undertake \nrepair and maintenance in terms of availability of and access to required labor, \nmachinery and equipment, and arrangements within the WUA. \n(vi)  Determine the staff and related costs of DWR, disaggregating them into central, \noblast, and raion levels, and of the sample WUAs. \n \n4.   Cost of Water \n \n10.  The consultants will determine the cost of water by doing the following: \n \n(i)  Carry  out  a  rapid  desk  study  of  information  on  costs  of  rehabilitation,  and \noperation and maintenance (O&M) of irrigation systems deriving from all recent \nand  ongoing  work  in  the  irrigation  sector,  notably  the  Agriculture  Area \nDevelopment Project and On-Farm Irrigation Project. \n(ii)  From these data determine the range of costs attributable to the rehabilitation, \nO&M of irrigation works, dividing these into on- and off-farm costs. ", "14  Appendix 4 \n(iii)  For  the  four  irrigation  systems  selected  to  represent  a  cross-section  of \nconditions, carry out a physical assessment of the irrigation system from source \nof water to points of delivery to the farm. \n(iv)  Determine the main system characteristics that affect the costs of rehabilitation, \nO&M, dividing them into on- and off-farm costs. \n(v)  Based on the characterization of the selected irrigation systems, assess the \nrange of rehabilitation, O&M, costs of the system dividing these into on- and off-\nfarm  costs,  clearly  separating  the  costs  of  mechanized  and  hand-labor \noperations. \n(vi)  Identify  the  apportionment  of  costs  for  the  rehabilitation,  O&M  of  systems \nbetween each level of DWR, village councils, and WUAs. \n(vii)  Relate the above apportionment of costs to the revenues of all the institutions \ncontributing to these costs. \n \n5.   Returns to Irrigated Agriculture \n \n11.  The consultants will estimate the economic and financial returns to irrigated agriculture \nby carrying out the following activities: \n \n(i)  Survey and analyze the selected irrigation systems\u2019 margins associated with \nirrigated  agriculture,  and  determine  the  key  factors  affecting  them,  including \ncropping system, use of inputs, on-farm value-added processes, and marketing \narrangements. Consider farm size, gender aspects, income levels, etc., which \nwill affect outcomes. \n(ii)  Identify the factors that constrain profitability of irrigated agriculture, including \naccess to and affordability of inputs, cost and availability of mechanization, and \naccess to credit and markets. Consider farm size, gender aspects, income levels, \netc., which will affect outcomes. \n(iii)  Estimate water usage of different cropping systems. \n(iv)  Prepare  models  of  cropping  systems  that  will  yield  high  margins,  clearly \nidentifying the returns to land, labor, and water. \n(v)  Assess the gender division of labor and access to decision making related to \nirrigated agriculture and irrigation water management, to identify ways to ensure \nthat women farmers\u2019 needs and constraints are reflected in the cost recovery and \nWUA management system. \n(vi)  Relate the current returns to irrigated agriculture to the affordability of payments \nfor irrigation water. \n \n  6.   Cost Recovery  \n \n12.  The consultants will develop an appropriate cost recovery strategy by undertaking the \nfollowing activities: \n \n(i)  Review the key literature on pricing systems and cost-recovery mechanisms in \nrelevant countries.1 \n                                                 \n1\n As a starting point, the consultants should refer to the following literature: (i) Dole, D. 2003. Setting User Charges \nfor Public Services: Policies and Practice at the Asian Development Bank. Manila: ADB; (ii) Johansson, Robert C. \n2000. Pricing Irrigation Water: A Literature Survey. Washington, DC: World Bank; and (iii) Dinar, Ariel, and Ashok \nSubramanian, eds. 1997. Water Pricing Experiences: An International Perspective. Washington, DC: World Bank. ", "Appendix 4  15 \n(ii)  Drawing on the experience of the Agriculture Area Development Project and On-\nFarm Irrigation Project, and supplemented by studies on the selected irrigation \nsystems, determine how pricing and cost-recovery practices vary among WUAs. \nThese studies will include levels of charges; comparison of alternative bases of \ncharge (volumetric, based on the quantity of water used; flat rates, based on area \nirrigated; or a combination of both); phasing of payments; and apportionment of \npayment in cash and kind. Determine if poor farmers have been given special \nconsideration under these projects, and identify the impacts on the poor and their \ncoping mechanisms. \n(iii)  In the selected irrigation schemes, survey users for their willingness to pay for \nwater, clearly identifying the factors that influence attitudes, including quantum, \nbasis, and phasing of charges. The survey should be qualitative and quantitative \nto address all economic, social (including gender and poverty), institutional, and \npolitical factors influencing farmers\u2019 ability and willingness to pay. \n(iv)  Determine how attitudes to paying for water will be influenced by improved levels \nof margin through better access to inputs and markets. \n(v)  Compare recovered and incurred costs, disaggregating all costs and revenues \ninto on- and off-farm. \n(vi)  Formulate alternative pricing systems and cost-recovery mechanisms to remove \nconstraints on real ability and willingness of final beneficiaries to pay, reflecting \neconomic,  social  (including  gender  and  poverty),  institutional,  and  political \nfactors. \n(vii)  Evaluate  the  costs  and  benefits  of  each  alternative  in  terms  of  equitability, \naffordability to poor users, appropriateness to socioeconomic circumstances, and \ncompatibility  with  the  efficient  and  sustainable  use  of  water.  The  evaluation \nshould reflect economic, social (including gender and poverty), institutional, and \npolitical factors. \n(viii)  Recommend  a  realistic  basis  for  water  charges  while  ensuring  that  the \nGovernment can provide a sustainable irrigation service. \n(ix)  Propose  the  extent  to  which  individual  WUAs  can  set  their  own  levels  and \nsystems of charging, means of penalizing individual farmers or WUAs that fail to \nmeet their financial obligations, and how water charges may be increased as the \nability  to  pay  increases  through  improvement  in  the  profitability  of  irrigated \nfarming.  \n \n7.  Dissemination of Information \n \n13.  The consultants will develop the framework and specific methodology for disseminating \nTA findings through the following activities: \n \n(i)  Discuss the survey methodology and study results with the main stakeholders\u2014\nGovernment,  WUAs,  nongovernment  organizations,  local  communities,  and \nusers through workshops and seminars. \n(ii)  Prepare a public awareness campaign through various media to disseminate the \nstudy\u2019s findings and outcomes, and to encourage the irrigation water users to \nadopt appropriate cost-recovery mechanisms for the long-term sustainability of \nirrigation systems. \n(iii)  Use the study results to prepare the second agriculture area development project \nscheduled for 2006. ", "16  Appendix 4 \n(iv)  Prepare  a  CD-ROM2  compiling  the  consultants\u2019  work,  and  which  will  be \nmaintained in DWR for dissemination of information. \n(v)  Submit an inception report outlining the study, and summarizing the literature and \nlegislation reviews, participatory approach adopted, selection of systems, survey \nmethodology, and a study schedule at the end of the first month, followed by a \nmeeting of the study coordination group. \n(vi)  Submit an interim report at the end of 3 months. \n(vii)  Submit a draft final report at the end of 5 months, to be followed by a national \nworkshop. Following the workshop and comments by all stakeholders, submit a \nfinal report. \n(viii)  Arrange  for  the  publication  of  the  study  in  English  and  Russian,  with  a \nsummarized version in Kyrgyz, in appropriate forms and mediums to maximize its \ndistribution. \n \n8.  Reporting \n \n14.  The consultants will produce the following reports: (i) an inception report at the end of \nthe first month, followed by a meeting of the study coordination group, outlining the study, and \nsummarizing  the  literature  and  legislation  reviews,  participatory  approach  being  adopted, \nselection of systems, survey methodology, and a study schedule; (ii) an interim report at the end \nof 3 months; (iii) a draft final report at the end of 5 months, followed by a national workshop; and \n(iv) the final report, after all stakeholders\u2019 comments have been incorporated. The consultants \nwill develop a format for an ex-post impact assessment report to be completed and submitted to \nADB by MAWRPI 3 years after completion of the TA. \n \n \n                                                 \n2\n Compact Disk-Read Only Memory.
