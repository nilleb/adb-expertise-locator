In 1996, the Government of India requested the Bank to provide technical\nassistance (TA) for strengthening housing finance institutions (HFls) in the country. In\nresponse to the request, a Bank Fact-finding Mission visited India in February 1997. The\nMission had discussions with representatives of Government agencies, HFIs, research\ninstitutions, bilateral aid agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and members of\nsavings and credit groups in rural and urban areas, and reached an understanding with the\nGovernment on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation\narrangements, and the terms of reference for the consulting services under the TA.1\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Government has given high development priority to housing since the first\nFive-year Plan. However, unfulfilled housing needs are still high, especially among low-income\ngroups (LIGs) and economically weaker sections (EWSs)2 in the country. In preparation of the\nNinth Five-year Plan (1997/98-2001/02), a Sub-Group on Financing of Urban Housing\nDevelopment estimated that the housing shortage by the end of the Eighth Plan was about 8\nmillion units. During the Ninth Plan another 9 million units will be needed, resulting in a total\ndemand of about 17 million housing units by the year 2002. Of the total unfulfilled demand,\nLIGs and EWSs account for more than 80 percent. The Sub-Group estimated that the financial\nresources required to eliminate the housing shortage would be about Rsl,214 billion ($34\nbillion). The Bank has provided TA for formulating the urban development strategy, including\nhousing, in the Ninth Plan.3\n3. In the early five-year planning periods, a variety of interventions by Central and\nstate agencies to reduce the housing shortage for LIGs and EWSs through budgetary support\nmet limited success. Most of the programs were implemented by state housing boards and\nslum improvement boards with little concern for cost recovery or sustainability. The role of such\nagencies is still important in some states where they are being reorganized and are acting as\nfacilitators in line with the National Housing Policy. The Government has undertaken several\nother institutional and policy measures to encourage the establishment of market-oriented\nHFIs.\n4. The National Housing Bank (NHB), established in 1988 and owned by the\nReserve Bank of India, is responsible for promoting, regulating, and providing refinancing and\nequity support for private housing finance companies (HFCs). The principal financing activity of\nNHB has been promoting the growth of HFCs through refinancing and equity investment.\nRecently, NHB expanded its operations into the retail housing finance market and has been\nactively promoting the development of a secondary mortgage market. As an apex institution in\nhousing finance, NHB plays a crucial role in developing a sound and effective housing finance\nsystem. Facing the increasingly competitive housing finance market in the wake of financial\nderegulation in the country, NHB needs to review its objectives, functions, and operations to\ndevelop its long-term business strategies.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 1997.\n2\t\nEWS is officially defined as a household with a monthly income below Rs2,100; LIG is a household with a\nmonthly income between Rs2,100 and Rs4,500.\nTA No. 2098-IND: Urban Sector Proffle, for $400,000, approved on 14 June 1994.", "2\n5. The Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), a private institution,\nwas the only large HFC until recently when Government liberalization and support mechanisms\nwere initiated. Over the past two decades, HDFC has expanded rapidly with loan approvals\ngrowing at an annual rate of 42 percent. HDFC is a listed public company with a triple A rating,\nand the bulk of its lending goes to middle- and upper-income groups. The Housing and Urban\nDevelopment Corporation (HUDCO) - a Central Government undertaking - and various state\nagencies have been responsible for providing shelter for low-income families. Since its\ninception, HUDCO has committed Rs129 billion ($3.7 billion) to housing development projects,\nwhich will provide over 6 million housing units. More than 90 percent of the units are targeted at\nLIGs and EWSs.\n6. External funding agencies have provided substantial assistance to HUDCO,\nHDFC, and NHB. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided a\n$150 million loan to HDFC in 1983 for operational expansion, and a $6.4 million technical\nassistance grant to NHB for a five-year capacity-building program, which will end this year.\nRecently, USAID provided a $40 million line of credit to NHB with the objectives of mobilizing\nmarket-derived resources, strengthening NHB's regulatory functions, and expanding the supply\nof housing finance to LIGs and EWSs. Subsequent to the International Finance Corporation's\ninitial equity investment in HDFC, the World Bank approved a loan of $250 million to HDFC in\n1988, which enabled HDFC to expand rapidly into wider geographic areas and build up its\ninstitutional capacity. Since 1984, the German Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau has assisted\nHUDCO and HDFC through grants, loans, and credit lines in lending to LlGs and EWSs in\nurban and rural areas. The assistance will enable HUDCO to build 350,000 low-cost housing\nunits for EWS families, and HDFC to extend housing assistance to about 85,000 households.\n7. While the efforts of the Government, HUDCO, HDFC, NHB, and external funding\nagencies have provided significant financing assistance to LIGs and EWSs, financial flows to\n[IC and EWS households still lag behind the growth of the housing finance market. Although\nLIGs and EWSs account for more than 80 percent of the unfulfilled housing needs and 49\npercent of the total housing finance requirement, the share of households below the annual\nmedian income1 in housing loans is only 13.5 percent. Studies show that the fact that the\nmajority of the formal2 HFIs have not been able to effectively reach the low-income segments of\nthe housing finance market often reflects their inappropriate approach and lending structure,\nrather than affordability of the loans to the poor. For loan considerations, the formal HFIs rely\non standard appraisal procedures, which are cumbersome to the poor and provide larger loans\nwhereas the poor prefer smaller amounts.\n8. Inadequate support from formal financial institutions for the finance needs of\nLIGs and EWSs has led to a large number of community-based financial institutions (CFI5)\nentering the field of housing finance. More than 32,000 credit cooperative societies and about\n1,400 cooperative banks with more than 3,400 branches throughout India provide basic\nfinancial services to the LIGs and EWSs. However, few of these CFIs have been able to\nprovide sustainable housing finance to the poor, partly because of lack of access to adequate\nfinancial resources available only from formal financial institutions, and partly because of their\nlack of managerial skills.\nIn 1996, this was estimated at Rs40,000,\nThe formal sector includes all financing institutions under Government regulations, while the informal sector\ncovers community-based financial institutions, NGOs, and individual moneylenders.", "'I\n9. To increase financial flows for housing to low-income households, the linkages\nbetween informal credit networks and formal financial institutions need to be expanded. HFIs\ntend to consider lending to CFIs as cost-ineffective and risky because the size of loans to low-\nincome families is usually small and therefore entails higher operating overheads. In addition,\nlow-income families normally cannot produce the conventional security to meet the lending\nrequirements of HFls.\n10. To enable formal HFIs to more effectively reach the low-income segments of the\npopulation, there is a need to (i) develop a consistent and systematic methodology to evaluate\nthe CFIs and NGOs; (ii) provide HFIs with guidelines on lending to CFIs; (iii) study the\nmechanism of providing reasonable coverage to the risks that formal HFIs will have to bear in\nreaching the low-income market; and (iv) assist major HFIs' ongoing training programs in\n\"training the trainers\" of key personnel in both the formal and informal HFls.\n11. One mechanism for risk coverage is the establishment of a housing loan\ninsurance fund. Such a fund will provide insurance to both primary and secondary lenders in the\nhousing finance market. A lending program that consciously expects 2 to 3 percent of all loans\nmade to result in default should result in approval of more qualified applicants than a program\nthat endeavors to eliminate all prospective defaulters. An initial study on India's mortgage\ninsurance market shows that a properly designed insurance scheme will make housing finance\nmore affordable, and can therefore expand the market by about 15 percent.\n12. The slow development of the linkage between the formal and informal housing\nfinance sectors also reflects a lack of incentives for CFIs and NGOs to enter the formal sector.\nCFls and NGOs need to look beyond their service delivery functions, reduce the cost of their\noperations, improve operating efficiencies, and expand operational coverage. There is therefore\na need to find ways of incorporating incentives into the housing finance programs of CFls and\nNGOs, as well as examine the role of NHB in promoting the efficiency of the formal and the\ninformal housing finance sectors.\n13. The TA will support the Bank's overall strategic objectives to assist the\nGovernment in increasing economic efficiency, achieving higher levels of sustainable economic\ngrowth, and reducing poverty. In operational terms, the Bank's strategy in finance and capital\nmarkets will assist in developing a sound financial system conducive to efficient mobilization\nand allocation of resources, including reforming the housing finance system through\nenhancement of competition and deregulation, strengthening the nonbanking informal sector,\nand supporting housing loan securitization. The Bank's housing finance sector strategy as well\nas its strategic objectives, and the Government's National Housing Policy are all consistent.\nThe Bank's housing sector strategy focuses on (i) creating a conducive policy framework for\nmerging the informal and formal approaches to provision of housing and modernizing the\nhousing finance systems, (ii) improving access of the poor to housing, and (iii) enhancing\ninstitutional capacity at all levels to improve efficiency in the delivery of housing finance. The\nBank's current Country Assistance Plan for India includes the Bank's first loan to the housing\nfinance sector. Low-income groups are the major targeted beneficiaries of the proposed loan.\nConsequently, the TA is closely linked to the Bank's sector operations, as the findings of the TA\nwill help the financial institutions reach the targeted groups.", "4\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n14. The TA will assist the Government n promoting financial flows to the housing\nsector by (I) facilitating the integration of formal and informal financial institutions, particularly\ncommunity-based organizations, through development of suitable mechanisms to promote\nmutual understanding and formal business linkages; (ii) assessing the feasibility, efficiency, and\noperational aspects of a housing loan insurance fund covering community-based housing\nfinance insurance as well as general mortgage insurance; (iii) determining the actions\nnecessary to strengthen NHB as the apex HFI and a regulator in the sector; (iv) providing\ntraining assistance to HFIs through HUDCO for the development of community-based housing\nfinance; and (v) examining ways and means to promote a bigger role for the private sector in\nthe development of housing finance.\nB.\t Scope\n15. The TA will comprise three parallel parts. Part A will focus on the (i) promotion of\nmutual understanding between HFIs and CFls on one hand and NGOs on the other through\ndevelopment of a consistent and systematic methodology for HFls to evaluate CFls and NGOs,\nand for the latter to understand the operational requirements of formal financial institutions; (ii)\ndesign and implementation in selected communities of pilot projects to test the recommended\nmethodology; (iii) development of necessary guidelines for NHB with respect to refinancing\nHFIs' lending to CFIs; and (iv) providing \"training for the trainers\" through workshops for the\nstaff of key HFIs that on-lend to CFIs. Part B will focus on the feasibility of establishing a\nhousing loan insurance fund. The study will evaluate legal, organizational, operational, and\nfinancial aspects of the fund, and recommend detailed implementation and operational\nprocedures including the role of the Government and the private sector. Part C will evaluate the\noperational effectiveness of NHB. The study will develop benchmarks in the key result areas of\nNHB, which will measure its future performance vis-\u00e0-vis its mission statement.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The estimated cost of the TA is $648,000 equivalent, comprising $343,000 in\nforeign exchange cost and $305,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Bank will provide a\ngrant of $600,000 to finance the foreign exchange cost and $257,000 equivalent of the local\ncurrency cost. The Government will finance the remaining $48,000 equivalent, which will cover\nthe cost of counterpart staff, communications, and office rentals. The details of cost estimates\nand financing arrangements are presented in Appendix 1.\n0.\t Implementation Arrangements\n17. The Department of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Finance will be the\nExecuting Agency (EA) for the TA. A Project Office will be established in NHB. A general\nmanager in NHB will serve concurrently as the Project Director for the implementation of the\nTA. Counterpart staff from NHB, HUDCO, and HDFC will be working in the Project Office\ntogether with the TA consultants. The training for staff of HFIs in lending to CFIs will make use\nof the facilities of Habitat Polytech, which is HUDCO's training arm for CFI and NGO lending.\nThe EA will ensure that adequate office space and qualified counterpart staff are available to", "5\nthe consultants, and will coordinate with other Government agencies in providing necessary\nsupport to the consultants, including access to information and project sites, and facilities.\n18. The TA will be carried out over 14 months by two international and four domestic\nindividual consultants, with expertise in housing finance, financial institution development and\nmanagement, mortgage insurance, and housing finance through CFIs. About 40 person-months\nof consulting services (about 8 person-months international and 32 person-months domestic)\nwill be required. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank on the engagement of\ndomestic consultants. Outline terms of reference on consulting services are given in Appendix\n2. To ensure timely implementation, essential office equipment will be procured by the\nconsultants under the TA following direct purchase procedures satisfactory to the Bank.\n19. The consultants for each part of the TA will submit to the Bank a separate\ninception report one month after commencement of services. The consultants for Part A will\nsubmit an interim report within six months on findings and recommendations for discussion at a\nworkshop with participation of representative stakeholders. A draft final report will be submitted\nwithin 12 months, presenting the initial assessment of the pilot projects. The consultants for\nPart B will submit an interim report, within two months of commencement of services,\ndescribing the preliminary findings for discussion at a workshop with participation of concerned\nGovernment agencies and representatives of HFIs, CFIs, and private institutional investors. A\ndraft final report for Part B will be submitted within five months. For Part C, the consultants will\nsubmit an inception report within one month after commencement of services, and a draft final\nreport within three months. The final reports for all three parts will be submitted one month after\nthe receipt of consolidated comments from the Bank and the Government. The TA is expected\nto be completed in October 1998.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n20. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of India in an amount\nnot exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the purpose of the Strengthening Housing Finance\nInstitutions Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "\t\n\t\n6 Appendix 1\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'OOO)\n\t \t\nItem Foreign\t Local Total\n\t\nExchange Curren Costs\nA.

Promoting Business Linkage Between Housing Finance Institutions (HFI5)\nand Community-based Financial Institutions (CFIs)\n1. Part A will require the services of one domestic CFI specialist (12 person-\nmonths) and one domestic low-income housing specialist (12 person-months). The two\nconsultants will cooperate closely with each other to accomplish the tasks listed below. The\nCFI specialist will serve as the team leader and will be responsible for preparing consolidated\nreports for submission to the Bank in accordance with the reporting schedule. The consultants\nwill have experience in housing finance, and be skillful in conducting interviews and surveys in\ncommunities, and in organizing workshops. They will recommend suitable mechanisms for\npromoting smooth integration of HFIs and CFls; develop and implement pilot projects in\nselected communities for testing the recommended mechanisms; and conduct workshops to\ndisseminate the lessons learned. Since the Housing and Urban Development Corporation\n(HUDCO) has considerable experience in lending to low-income groups in both rural and urban\nareas, the consultants will coordinate closely with HUDCO. Workshops will be conducted using\nthe facilities of Habitat Polytech, HUDCO's training arm. Specifically, the consultants will, inter\nalia, accomplish these tasks.\n(i) Review studies, reports, and documents on HFIs in both formal and informal\nsectors and acquire an understanding of their respective strengths and\nlimitations.\n(ii) Thoroughly analyze the lending operations of the major HFIs, especially the\nNational Housing Bank (NHB), the Housing Development Finance Corporation\n(HDFC), HUDCO, and a representative sample of other HFIs to assess the\nextent and effectiveness of their lending to CFIs and/or directly to low-income\nindividuals; prepare a detailed flow diagram of housing finance processes from\nNHB, HDFC, and HUDCO to low-income households through CFIs; assess\nconstraints to expansion of the operations; and recommend improvements.\n(iii) Interview the executives and branch managers of NHB, HDFC, HUDCO, the\nNational Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, and selected HFIs about\ntheir concerns and problems encountered in lending to nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs), CFIs, and low-income individuals, to identify barriers to\nreaching the informal financial sector.\n(iv) Assess the operations of selected GEls and NGOs responsible for delivering\nlow-income housing finance; interview managers or operators of the selected\nCFls and NGOs, urban cooperative banks, and members of thrift and credit\ngroups, urban credit and cooperative societies, to determine their views,\nproblems they encounter, and expectations from the formal HFIs.\n(v) Based on these interviews and assessments and in consultation with the CFI\nand HFI managers, make implementable recommendations for improving the\nbusiness linkages between HFIs and CFIs.\n(Reference in text: page 5, para. 18)", "8\t Appendix 2, page 2\n(vi) Design a set of quantifiable performance indicators for evaluating the operating\nand management efficiencies of CFls to give a quantified measure of the CFI's\ncapacity for handling additional funds from external sources. These indicators\nwill include, but will not be limited to, the number of years in operation, number of\nmembers or staff, net worth, sources and costs of capital, turnover, lending\nterms and conditions, defaults and arrears, profitability, staffing cost, other\noverheads, adequacy of bookkeeping, etc. (This task will be coordinated closely\nwith the international mortgage insurance specialist and the domestic HFI\nspecialist.)\n(vii) Based on the above analyses and categorization of CFls and in consultation with\nthe managers or operators of CFls and HFls, (a) develop suitable lending\nprocedures for HFls corresponding to each category of CFI, and (b) prepare\noperational manuals guiding CFIs in following the recommended procedures.\n(This task will be coordinated closely with the international mortgage insurance\nspecialist and the domestic HFI specialist.)\n(viii) Present the findings, conclusions, and recommendations to a workshop with\nrepresentatives from NHB, HUDCO, HDFC, selected HFls and CFls, and\nlow-income groups (LIG5). Using the feedback from the workshop, design pilot\nprojects, and assist selected HFls in implementing them, applying different\nlending models and aiming at enhancing the linkages between the formal\nfinancing institutions and CFls in selected communities.\n(ix) Document the initial findings of the pilot projects, prepare recommendations for\nlaunching similar projects countrywide, and conduct a workshop presenting the\nfindings and recommendations to the participating stakeholders.\n(x) Based on the results of the pilot projects and feedback from the workshop, assist\nNHB in developing guidelines for formal financing institutions' lending to CFIs,\nand in expanding such lending throughout the country.\n(xi) Assess the training needs of HUDCO and the CFIs for meeting low-income\nhousing requirements over the near term or midterm, and recommend an\ninstitutional and human resource development program for HUDCO.\n(xii) Using the results of the above activities, prepare training materials on housing\nfinance to low-income groups through CFls, and implement a training program\nutilizing the training materials prepared.\n(xiii) Undertake institutional assessment of HUDCO's borrowing institutions that are\ninvolved in low-income housing finance, such as the state housing boards;\nidentify their institutional weakness and obstacles to effective and efficient\nlending to low-income groups; and recommend necessary actions by HUDCO\nand the borrowing institutions for improvement.\n2. A central theme of Part A is to identify the incentives for the HFls to reach the\nCFls, and for the CFls to interlink with the HFls, and to build these incentives into the\nlending/borrowing mechanism of HFls and CFIs. In this context, the consultants will undertake a", "9\t Appendix 2, page 3\nsurvey, supplemented with interviews, on the operations of individual moneylenders in selected\ncommunities. A similar set of indicators as for the CFIs will be developed to make a\ncomparison. Such comparison is expected to give a better understanding of the operational\nweaknesses of the CFIs.\nB.\t Part B. Feasibility of Establishing a Housing Loan Insurance Fund\n3. The consulting services in Part B require the input of one international expert\nwith expertise in mortgage insurance (5 person-months) and one domestic HFI specialist (5\nperson-months). To enhance financial flows to the housing finance sector in general and to low-\nincome housing finance in particular, the consultants will determine the feasibility of establishing\na housing loan insurance fund, preferably with private sector participation. The international\nexpert will serve as the team leader and will be responsible for preparing consolidated reports\nfor submission to the Bank in accordance with the reporting schedule. The consultants will\ncoordinate with each other in pursuing the listed tasks.\n(i) Review studies, reports, and documents on housing finance in India, particularly\nlow-income housing finance, secondary mortgage market development, and\nmortgage insurance; and review risk management programs and mortgage\ninsurance schemes in other countries.\n(ii) Review and assess the current and planned lending operations of the major\nHFls, especially NHB, HDFC, and HUDCO, to determine the extent of their\nexposures to CFIs and low-income individuals, and their need for insurance for\nsuch exposures.\n(iii) Assess and quantify the risks of lending to CFIs and NGOs by analyzing the loan\nquality and operational efficiency of selected CFIs and NGOs; estimate the risk\npremium needed to cover each type of CFI and NGO; and assess the\naffordability of home loan insurance to CFIs and NGOs, and their willingness to\npay for such insurance. (This task will be carried out in collaboration with the CFI\nspecialist and the domestic low-income housing specialist.)\n(iv) Assess the impact of a mortgage insurance scheme on the development of a\nsecondary mortgage market, and the need of HFIs and institutional investors for\nsuch a scheme.\n(v) Based on the above activities, outline the business strategies for the housing\nloan insurance fund; estimate the market potential, the amount of capital needed\nfor a housing loan insurance fund, and the expected rate of return on capital.\n(vi) Review relevant legal documents and Government financial regulations, and\nprepare a plan for capital contribution, in consultation with concerned\nGovernment agencies including NHB, the Ministry of Finance, Reserve Bank of\nIndia, Insurance Regulatory Authority of India (IRAI), and selected HFIs.\n(vii)\t Examine the role of the private sector in the proposed insurance fund; compare\ndifferent scenarios including fully privately owned and operated, jointly owned by", "10\t Appendix 2, page 4\nthe private and public sectors and privately operated, publicly owned and\nprivately operated, and publicly owned and operated; and assess the suitability\nof Bank investment in the fund under each of the scenarios.\n(viii) Conduct a workshop on the impediments to the development of a sound housing\nloan insurance fund, with participants from concerned Government agencies,\nNHB, selected HFIs and CFIs, potential securitization underwriters, institutional\ninvestors, and the Bank; and obtain agreement among the participants on the\nneed for such a fund, and actions to be taken by participants to improve the\ndevelopmental environment for the fund.\n(ix) Undertake product design for the fund, covering primary and secondary\nmortgage lending as well as housing loans to CFls; determine the price for each\nproduct with due consideration of the long-term financial viability of the fund, the\ncost and benefit to the originating lenders, and affordability to the CFls, LIGs,\nand the economically weaker sections (EWS5) of society; prepare underwriting\npolicy statement and detailed acceptance and rejection guidelines; assess the\navailability and cost of the expertise needed for insurance underwriting, actuarial\nanalysis and marketing, and prepare a human resources development program;\ndevelop a medium-term marketing plan on the basis of market assessment and\nresource requirements; establish guidelines and procedures for claims\nsettlement; identify potential reinsurers for the fund to share the cost of\ncatastrophic claims; and prepare sound investment guidelines for the fund, with\nthe objectives of safety, liquidity, and profitability.\n(x) Develop a set of indicators to monitor and assess the performance of the\ninsurance fund against the targets as outlined in the preceding operational\nguidelines.\n(xi) Discuss and agree with concerned Government agencies, lRAl, and potential\ninvestors of the fund on a timetable for setting up the fund.\n4. The guiding principle in designing and operating the insurance fund will be its\nuse only as the relief of last resort, and applicability to only certain types of risk. The\nunderwriting policies and claims settlement guidelines must be designed in such a way that the\nfund will not be viewed as encouraging imprudent lending.\nC.\t Part C. Institutional Strengthening of NHB\n5. The consulting services for Part C require the input of one international housing\nfinance specialist (3 person-months) and one domestic financial management specialist (3\nperson-months). The consultants will coordinate with the consultants for the other parts of the\nTA to determine the role of NHB in integrating the formal HFls with the community-based\nhousing finance networks, and the relationship between NHB and the proposed housing loan\ninsurance fund.

In 1996, the Government of India requested the Bank to provide technical\nassistance (TA) for strengthening housing finance institutions (HFls) in the country. In\nresponse to the request, a Bank Fact-finding Mission visited India in February 1997. The\nMission had discussions with representatives of Government agencies, HFIs, research\ninstitutions, bilateral aid agencies, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and members of\nsavings and credit groups in rural and urban areas, and reached an understanding with the\nGovernment on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, implementation\narrangements, and the terms of reference for the consulting services under the TA.1\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Government has given high development priority to housing since the first\nFive-year Plan. However, unfulfilled housing needs are still high, especially among low-income\ngroups (LIGs) and economically weaker sections (EWSs)2 in the country. In preparation of the\nNinth Five-year Plan (1997/98-2001/02), a Sub-Group on Financing of Urban Housing\nDevelopment estimated that the housing shortage by the end of the Eighth Plan was about 8\nmillion units. During the Ninth Plan another 9 million units will be needed, resulting in a total\ndemand of about 17 million housing units by the year 2002. Of the total unfulfilled demand,\nLIGs and EWSs account for more than 80 percent. The Sub-Group estimated that the financial\nresources required to eliminate the housing shortage would be about Rsl,214 billion ($34\nbillion). The Bank has provided TA for formulating the urban development strategy, including\nhousing, in the Ninth Plan.3\n3. In the early five-year planning periods, a variety of interventions by Central and\nstate agencies to reduce the housing shortage for LIGs and EWSs through budgetary support\nmet limited success. Most of the programs were implemented by state housing boards and\nslum improvement boards with little concern for cost recovery or sustainability. The role of such\nagencies is still important in some states where they are being reorganized and are acting as\nfacilitators in line with the National Housing Policy. The Government has undertaken several\nother institutional and policy measures to encourage the establishment of market-oriented\nHFIs.\n4. The National Housing Bank (NHB), established in 1988 and owned by the\nReserve Bank of India, is responsible for promoting, regulating, and providing refinancing and\nequity support for private housing finance companies (HFCs). The principal financing activity of\nNHB has been promoting the growth of HFCs through refinancing and equity investment.\nRecently, NHB expanded its operations into the retail housing finance market and has been\nactively promoting the development of a secondary mortgage market. As an apex institution in\nhousing finance, NHB plays a crucial role in developing a sound and effective housing finance\nsystem. Facing the increasingly competitive housing finance market in the wake of financial\nderegulation in the country, NHB needs to review its objectives, functions, and operations to\ndevelop its long-term business strategies.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in January 1997.\n2\t\nEWS is officially defined as a household with a monthly income below Rs2,100; LIG is a household with a\nmonthly income between Rs2,100 and Rs4,500.\nTA No. 2098-IND: Urban Sector Proffle, for $400,000, approved on 14 June 1994.", "2\n5. The Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC), a private institution,\nwas the only large HFC until recently when Government liberalization and support mechanisms\nwere initiated. Over the past two decades, HDFC has expanded rapidly with loan approvals\ngrowing at an annual rate of 42 percent. HDFC is a listed public company with a triple A rating,\nand the bulk of its lending goes to middle- and upper-income groups. The Housing and Urban\nDevelopment Corporation (HUDCO) - a Central Government undertaking - and various state\nagencies have been responsible for providing shelter for low-income families. Since its\ninception, HUDCO has committed Rs129 billion ($3.7 billion) to housing development projects,\nwhich will provide over 6 million housing units. More than 90 percent of the units are targeted at\nLIGs and EWSs.\n6. External funding agencies have provided substantial assistance to HUDCO,\nHDFC, and NHB. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided a\n$150 million loan to HDFC in 1983 for operational expansion, and a $6.4 million technical\nassistance grant to NHB for a five-year capacity-building program, which will end this year.\nRecently, USAID provided a $40 million line of credit to NHB with the objectives of mobilizing\nmarket-derived resources, strengthening NHB's regulatory functions, and expanding the supply\nof housing finance to LIGs and EWSs. Subsequent to the International Finance Corporation's\ninitial equity investment in HDFC, the World Bank approved a loan of $250 million to HDFC in\n1988, which enabled HDFC to expand rapidly into wider geographic areas and build up its\ninstitutional capacity. Since 1984, the German Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau has assisted\nHUDCO and HDFC through grants, loans, and credit lines in lending to LlGs and EWSs in\nurban and rural areas. The assistance will enable HUDCO to build 350,000 low-cost housing\nunits for EWS families, and HDFC to extend housing assistance to about 85,000 households.\n7. While the efforts of the Government, HUDCO, HDFC, NHB, and external funding\nagencies have provided significant financing assistance to LIGs and EWSs, financial flows to\n[IC and EWS households still lag behind the growth of the housing finance market. Although\nLIGs and EWSs account for more than 80 percent of the unfulfilled housing needs and 49\npercent of the total housing finance requirement, the share of households below the annual\nmedian income1 in housing loans is only 13.5 percent. Studies show that the fact that the\nmajority of the formal2 HFIs have not been able to effectively reach the low-income segments of\nthe housing finance market often reflects their inappropriate approach and lending structure,\nrather than affordability of the loans to the poor. For loan considerations, the formal HFIs rely\non standard appraisal procedures, which are cumbersome to the poor and provide larger loans\nwhereas the poor prefer smaller amounts.\n8. Inadequate support from formal financial institutions for the finance needs of\nLIGs and EWSs has led to a large number of community-based financial institutions (CFI5)\nentering the field of housing finance. More than 32,000 credit cooperative societies and about\n1,400 cooperative banks with more than 3,400 branches throughout India provide basic\nfinancial services to the LIGs and EWSs. However, few of these CFIs have been able to\nprovide sustainable housing finance to the poor, partly because of lack of access to adequate\nfinancial resources available only from formal financial institutions, and partly because of their\nlack of managerial skills.\nIn 1996, this was estimated at Rs40,000,\nThe formal sector includes all financing institutions under Government regulations, while the informal sector\ncovers community-based financial institutions, NGOs, and individual moneylenders.", "'I\n9. To increase financial flows for housing to low-income households, the linkages\nbetween informal credit networks and formal financial institutions need to be expanded. HFIs\ntend to consider lending to CFIs as cost-ineffective and risky because the size of loans to low-\nincome families is usually small and therefore entails higher operating overheads. In addition,\nlow-income families normally cannot produce the conventional security to meet the lending\nrequirements of HFls.\n10. To enable formal HFIs to more effectively reach the low-income segments of the\npopulation, there is a need to (i) develop a consistent and systematic methodology to evaluate\nthe CFIs and NGOs; (ii) provide HFIs with guidelines on lending to CFIs; (iii) study the\nmechanism of providing reasonable coverage to the risks that formal HFIs will have to bear in\nreaching the low-income market; and (iv) assist major HFIs' ongoing training programs in\n\"training the trainers\" of key personnel in both the formal and informal HFls.\n11. One mechanism for risk coverage is the establishment of a housing loan\ninsurance fund. Such a fund will provide insurance to both primary and secondary lenders in the\nhousing finance market. A lending program that consciously expects 2 to 3 percent of all loans\nmade to result in default should result in approval of more qualified applicants than a program\nthat endeavors to eliminate all prospective defaulters. An initial study on India's mortgage\ninsurance market shows that a properly designed insurance scheme will make housing finance\nmore affordable, and can therefore expand the market by about 15 percent.\n12. The slow development of the linkage between the formal and informal housing\nfinance sectors also reflects a lack of incentives for CFIs and NGOs to enter the formal sector.\nCFls and NGOs need to look beyond their service delivery functions, reduce the cost of their\noperations, improve operating efficiencies, and expand operational coverage. There is therefore\na need to find ways of incorporating incentives into the housing finance programs of CFls and\nNGOs, as well as examine the role of NHB in promoting the efficiency of the formal and the\ninformal housing finance sectors.\n13. The TA will support the Bank's overall strategic objectives to assist the\nGovernment in increasing economic efficiency, achieving higher levels of sustainable economic\ngrowth, and reducing poverty. In operational terms, the Bank's strategy in finance and capital\nmarkets will assist in developing a sound financial system conducive to efficient mobilization\nand allocation of resources, including reforming the housing finance system through\nenhancement of competition and deregulation, strengthening the nonbanking informal sector,\nand supporting housing loan securitization. The Bank's housing finance sector strategy as well\nas its strategic objectives, and the Government's National Housing Policy are all consistent.\nThe Bank's housing sector strategy focuses on (i) creating a conducive policy framework for\nmerging the informal and formal approaches to provision of housing and modernizing the\nhousing finance systems, (ii) improving access of the poor to housing, and (iii) enhancing\ninstitutional capacity at all levels to improve efficiency in the delivery of housing finance. The\nBank's current Country Assistance Plan for India includes the Bank's first loan to the housing\nfinance sector. Low-income groups are the major targeted beneficiaries of the proposed loan.\nConsequently, the TA is closely linked to the Bank's sector operations, as the findings of the TA\nwill help the financial institutions reach the targeted groups.", "4\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n14. The TA will assist the Government n promoting financial flows to the housing\nsector by (I) facilitating the integration of formal and informal financial institutions, particularly\ncommunity-based organizations, through development of suitable mechanisms to promote\nmutual understanding and formal business linkages; (ii) assessing the feasibility, efficiency, and\noperational aspects of a housing loan insurance fund covering community-based housing\nfinance insurance as well as general mortgage insurance; (iii) determining the actions\nnecessary to strengthen NHB as the apex HFI and a regulator in the sector; (iv) providing\ntraining assistance to HFIs through HUDCO for the development of community-based housing\nfinance; and (v) examining ways and means to promote a bigger role for the private sector in\nthe development of housing finance.\nB.\t Scope\n15. The TA will comprise three parallel parts. Part A will focus on the (i) promotion of\nmutual understanding between HFIs and CFls on one hand and NGOs on the other through\ndevelopment of a consistent and systematic methodology for HFls to evaluate CFls and NGOs,\nand for the latter to understand the operational requirements of formal financial institutions; (ii)\ndesign and implementation in selected communities of pilot projects to test the recommended\nmethodology; (iii) development of necessary guidelines for NHB with respect to refinancing\nHFIs' lending to CFIs; and (iv) providing \"training for the trainers\" through workshops for the\nstaff of key HFIs that on-lend to CFIs. Part B will focus on the feasibility of establishing a\nhousing loan insurance fund. The study will evaluate legal, organizational, operational, and\nfinancial aspects of the fund, and recommend detailed implementation and operational\nprocedures including the role of the Government and the private sector. Part C will evaluate the\noperational effectiveness of NHB. The study will develop benchmarks in the key result areas of\nNHB, which will measure its future performance vis-\u00e0-vis its mission statement.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The estimated cost of the TA is $648,000 equivalent, comprising $343,000 in\nforeign exchange cost and $305,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Bank will provide a\ngrant of $600,000 to finance the foreign exchange cost and $257,000 equivalent of the local\ncurrency cost. The Government will finance the remaining $48,000 equivalent, which will cover\nthe cost of counterpart staff, communications, and office rentals. The details of cost estimates\nand financing arrangements are presented in Appendix 1.\n0.\t Implementation Arrangements\n17. The Department of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Finance will be the\nExecuting Agency (EA) for the TA. A Project Office will be established in NHB. A general\nmanager in NHB will serve concurrently as the Project Director for the implementation of the\nTA. Counterpart staff from NHB, HUDCO, and HDFC will be working in the Project Office\ntogether with the TA consultants. The training for staff of HFIs in lending to CFIs will make use\nof the facilities of Habitat Polytech, which is HUDCO's training arm for CFI and NGO lending.\nThe EA will ensure that adequate office space and qualified counterpart staff are available to", "5\nthe consultants, and will coordinate with other Government agencies in providing necessary\nsupport to the consultants, including access to information and project sites, and facilities.\n18. The TA will be carried out over 14 months by two international and four domestic\nindividual consultants, with expertise in housing finance, financial institution development and\nmanagement, mortgage insurance, and housing finance through CFIs. About 40 person-months\nof consulting services (about 8 person-months international and 32 person-months domestic)\nwill be required. The consultants will be recruited in accordance with the Bank's  Guidelines on\nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to the Bank on the engagement of\ndomestic consultants. Outline terms of reference on consulting services are given in Appendix\n2. To ensure timely implementation, essential office equipment will be procured by the\nconsultants under the TA following direct purchase procedures satisfactory to the Bank.\n19. The consultants for each part of the TA will submit to the Bank a separate\ninception report one month after commencement of services. The consultants for Part A will\nsubmit an interim report within six months on findings and recommendations for discussion at a\nworkshop with participation of representative stakeholders. A draft final report will be submitted\nwithin 12 months, presenting the initial assessment of the pilot projects. The consultants for\nPart B will submit an interim report, within two months of commencement of services,\ndescribing the preliminary findings for discussion at a workshop with participation of concerned\nGovernment agencies and representatives of HFIs, CFIs, and private institutional investors. A\ndraft final report for Part B will be submitted within five months. For Part C, the consultants will\nsubmit an inception report within one month after commencement of services, and a draft final\nreport within three months. The final reports for all three parts will be submitted one month after\nthe receipt of consolidated comments from the Bank and the Government. The TA is expected\nto be completed in October 1998.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n20. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of India in an amount\nnot exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the purpose of the Strengthening Housing Finance\nInstitutions Project, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "\t\n\t\n6 Appendix 1\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'OOO)\n\t \t\nItem Foreign\t Local Total\n\t\nExchange Curren Costs\nA.

Promoting Business Linkage Between Housing Finance Institutions (HFI5)\nand Community-based Financial Institutions (CFIs)\n1. Part A will require the services of one domestic CFI specialist (12 person-\nmonths) and one domestic low-income housing specialist (12 person-months). The two\nconsultants will cooperate closely with each other to accomplish the tasks listed below. The\nCFI specialist will serve as the team leader and will be responsible for preparing consolidated\nreports for submission to the Bank in accordance with the reporting schedule. The consultants\nwill have experience in housing finance, and be skillful in conducting interviews and surveys in\ncommunities, and in organizing workshops. They will recommend suitable mechanisms for\npromoting smooth integration of HFIs and CFls; develop and implement pilot projects in\nselected communities for testing the recommended mechanisms; and conduct workshops to\ndisseminate the lessons learned. Since the Housing and Urban Development Corporation\n(HUDCO) has considerable experience in lending to low-income groups in both rural and urban\nareas, the consultants will coordinate closely with HUDCO. Workshops will be conducted using\nthe facilities of Habitat Polytech, HUDCO's training arm. Specifically, the consultants will, inter\nalia, accomplish these tasks.\n(i) Review studies, reports, and documents on HFIs in both formal and informal\nsectors and acquire an understanding of their respective strengths and\nlimitations.\n(ii) Thoroughly analyze the lending operations of the major HFIs, especially the\nNational Housing Bank (NHB), the Housing Development Finance Corporation\n(HDFC), HUDCO, and a representative sample of other HFIs to assess the\nextent and effectiveness of their lending to CFIs and/or directly to low-income\nindividuals; prepare a detailed flow diagram of housing finance processes from\nNHB, HDFC, and HUDCO to low-income households through CFIs; assess\nconstraints to expansion of the operations; and recommend improvements.\n(iii) Interview the executives and branch managers of NHB, HDFC, HUDCO, the\nNational Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development, and selected HFIs about\ntheir concerns and problems encountered in lending to nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs), CFIs, and low-income individuals, to identify barriers to\nreaching the informal financial sector.\n(iv) Assess the operations of selected GEls and NGOs responsible for delivering\nlow-income housing finance; interview managers or operators of the selected\nCFls and NGOs, urban cooperative banks, and members of thrift and credit\ngroups, urban credit and cooperative societies, to determine their views,\nproblems they encounter, and expectations from the formal HFIs.\n(v) Based on these interviews and assessments and in consultation with the CFI\nand HFI managers, make implementable recommendations for improving the\nbusiness linkages between HFIs and CFIs.\n(Reference in text: page 5, para. 18)", "8\t Appendix 2, page 2\n(vi) Design a set of quantifiable performance indicators for evaluating the operating\nand management efficiencies of CFls to give a quantified measure of the CFI's\ncapacity for handling additional funds from external sources. These indicators\nwill include, but will not be limited to, the number of years in operation, number of\nmembers or staff, net worth, sources and costs of capital, turnover, lending\nterms and conditions, defaults and arrears, profitability, staffing cost, other\noverheads, adequacy of bookkeeping, etc. (This task will be coordinated closely\nwith the international mortgage insurance specialist and the domestic HFI\nspecialist.)\n(vii) Based on the above analyses and categorization of CFls and in consultation with\nthe managers or operators of CFls and HFls, (a) develop suitable lending\nprocedures for HFls corresponding to each category of CFI, and (b) prepare\noperational manuals guiding CFIs in following the recommended procedures.\n(This task will be coordinated closely with the international mortgage insurance\nspecialist and the domestic HFI specialist.)\n(viii) Present the findings, conclusions, and recommendations to a workshop with\nrepresentatives from NHB, HUDCO, HDFC, selected HFls and CFls, and\nlow-income groups (LIG5). Using the feedback from the workshop, design pilot\nprojects, and assist selected HFls in implementing them, applying different\nlending models and aiming at enhancing the linkages between the formal\nfinancing institutions and CFls in selected communities.\n(ix) Document the initial findings of the pilot projects, prepare recommendations for\nlaunching similar projects countrywide, and conduct a workshop presenting the\nfindings and recommendations to the participating stakeholders.\n(x) Based on the results of the pilot projects and feedback from the workshop, assist\nNHB in developing guidelines for formal financing institutions' lending to CFIs,\nand in expanding such lending throughout the country.\n(xi) Assess the training needs of HUDCO and the CFIs for meeting low-income\nhousing requirements over the near term or midterm, and recommend an\ninstitutional and human resource development program for HUDCO.\n(xii) Using the results of the above activities, prepare training materials on housing\nfinance to low-income groups through CFls, and implement a training program\nutilizing the training materials prepared.\n(xiii) Undertake institutional assessment of HUDCO's borrowing institutions that are\ninvolved in low-income housing finance, such as the state housing boards;\nidentify their institutional weakness and obstacles to effective and efficient\nlending to low-income groups; and recommend necessary actions by HUDCO\nand the borrowing institutions for improvement.\n2. A central theme of Part A is to identify the incentives for the HFls to reach the\nCFls, and for the CFls to interlink with the HFls, and to build these incentives into the\nlending/borrowing mechanism of HFls and CFIs. In this context, the consultants will undertake a", "9\t Appendix 2, page 3\nsurvey, supplemented with interviews, on the operations of individual moneylenders in selected\ncommunities. A similar set of indicators as for the CFIs will be developed to make a\ncomparison. Such comparison is expected to give a better understanding of the operational\nweaknesses of the CFIs.\nB.\t Part B. Feasibility of Establishing a Housing Loan Insurance Fund\n3. The consulting services in Part B require the input of one international expert\nwith expertise in mortgage insurance (5 person-months) and one domestic HFI specialist (5\nperson-months). To enhance financial flows to the housing finance sector in general and to low-\nincome housing finance in particular, the consultants will determine the feasibility of establishing\na housing loan insurance fund, preferably with private sector participation. The international\nexpert will serve as the team leader and will be responsible for preparing consolidated reports\nfor submission to the Bank in accordance with the reporting schedule. The consultants will\ncoordinate with each other in pursuing the listed tasks.\n(i) Review studies, reports, and documents on housing finance in India, particularly\nlow-income housing finance, secondary mortgage market development, and\nmortgage insurance; and review risk management programs and mortgage\ninsurance schemes in other countries.\n(ii) Review and assess the current and planned lending operations of the major\nHFls, especially NHB, HDFC, and HUDCO, to determine the extent of their\nexposures to CFIs and low-income individuals, and their need for insurance for\nsuch exposures.\n(iii) Assess and quantify the risks of lending to CFIs and NGOs by analyzing the loan\nquality and operational efficiency of selected CFIs and NGOs; estimate the risk\npremium needed to cover each type of CFI and NGO; and assess the\naffordability of home loan insurance to CFIs and NGOs, and their willingness to\npay for such insurance. (This task will be carried out in collaboration with the CFI\nspecialist and the domestic low-income housing specialist.)\n(iv) Assess the impact of a mortgage insurance scheme on the development of a\nsecondary mortgage market, and the need of HFIs and institutional investors for\nsuch a scheme.\n(v) Based on the above activities, outline the business strategies for the housing\nloan insurance fund; estimate the market potential, the amount of capital needed\nfor a housing loan insurance fund, and the expected rate of return on capital.\n(vi) Review relevant legal documents and Government financial regulations, and\nprepare a plan for capital contribution, in consultation with concerned\nGovernment agencies including NHB, the Ministry of Finance, Reserve Bank of\nIndia, Insurance Regulatory Authority of India (IRAI), and selected HFIs.\n(vii)\t Examine the role of the private sector in the proposed insurance fund; compare\ndifferent scenarios including fully privately owned and operated, jointly owned by", "10\t Appendix 2, page 4\nthe private and public sectors and privately operated, publicly owned and\nprivately operated, and publicly owned and operated; and assess the suitability\nof Bank investment in the fund under each of the scenarios.\n(viii) Conduct a workshop on the impediments to the development of a sound housing\nloan insurance fund, with participants from concerned Government agencies,\nNHB, selected HFIs and CFIs, potential securitization underwriters, institutional\ninvestors, and the Bank; and obtain agreement among the participants on the\nneed for such a fund, and actions to be taken by participants to improve the\ndevelopmental environment for the fund.\n(ix) Undertake product design for the fund, covering primary and secondary\nmortgage lending as well as housing loans to CFls; determine the price for each\nproduct with due consideration of the long-term financial viability of the fund, the\ncost and benefit to the originating lenders, and affordability to the CFls, LIGs,\nand the economically weaker sections (EWS5) of society; prepare underwriting\npolicy statement and detailed acceptance and rejection guidelines; assess the\navailability and cost of the expertise needed for insurance underwriting, actuarial\nanalysis and marketing, and prepare a human resources development program;\ndevelop a medium-term marketing plan on the basis of market assessment and\nresource requirements; establish guidelines and procedures for claims\nsettlement; identify potential reinsurers for the fund to share the cost of\ncatastrophic claims; and prepare sound investment guidelines for the fund, with\nthe objectives of safety, liquidity, and profitability.\n(x) Develop a set of indicators to monitor and assess the performance of the\ninsurance fund against the targets as outlined in the preceding operational\nguidelines.\n(xi) Discuss and agree with concerned Government agencies, lRAl, and potential\ninvestors of the fund on a timetable for setting up the fund.\n4. The guiding principle in designing and operating the insurance fund will be its\nuse only as the relief of last resort, and applicability to only certain types of risk. The\nunderwriting policies and claims settlement guidelines must be designed in such a way that the\nfund will not be viewed as encouraging imprudent lending.\nC.\t Part C. Institutional Strengthening of NHB\n5. The consulting services for Part C require the input of one international housing\nfinance specialist (3 person-months) and one domestic financial management specialist (3\nperson-months). The consultants will coordinate with the consultants for the other parts of the\nTA to determine the role of NHB in integrating the formal HFls with the community-based\nhousing finance networks, and the relationship between NHB and the proposed housing loan\ninsurance fund. The international consultant will serve as the team leader and will be\nresponsible for preparing consolidated reports for submission to the Bank in accordance with\nthe reporting schedule. The consultants will work closely with each other to accomplish these\ntasks.", "11\t Appendix 2, page 5\n(i) Review all the relevant documents, studies, and reports regarding NHB's\nmandate, functions, and performance, including its corporate plan (Vision 2002)\nand annual reports.\n(ii) Review the functions of NHB as a regulator of the housing finance system, a\npromoter of HFIs, a financier for housing loans, and a trainer of housing finance\nmanagers in the context of developing a sound housing finance system in the\ncountry; analyze NHB's strengths and weaknesses in performing these\nfunctions; and identify NHB's comparative advantages in the context of financial\nderegulation in the country.\n(iii) Interview representatives of various NHB lending windows, including HFIs,\nscheduled commercial banks, cooperative banks, and regional rural banks, to\nsolicit views on NHB's role in the development of the housing finance system.\n(iv) Review NHB's loan portfolio and assess its lending modalities and quality of\noutstanding loans; examine NHB's long-term financial positions, including its\nprojected business growth and sources of financing; and assess NHB's\ncorporate structure and the capacity of its human resources.\n(v) Explore other actions NHB should take to facilitate the integration of formal\nfinancial institutions with the informal housing finance sector, such as amending\nthe legislation to give NHB necessary foreclosure authority in case of loan\ndefaults.\n(vi) Using the results of the foregoing tasks, prepare a medium-term business\nstrategy that will maximize NHB's impact on the development of a sound,\neffective, and efficient housing finance system."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080229130126+08'00'", "Creator": "Envision OCR", "Keywords": "strengthening housing finance institutions, indian housing sector projects, indian housing loan insurance fund coverage, indian community based financial institutions, indian housing financing institution, adb technical assistance 2833, adb project 30536", "Producer": "www.adlibsoftware.com:EXS3185-Windows 2003:TNG", "ModDate": "D:20080722145154+08'00'", "Title": "Strengthening Housing Finance Institutions"}}
