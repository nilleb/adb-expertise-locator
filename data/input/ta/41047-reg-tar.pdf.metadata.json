INTRODUCTION \n1.  Economies depend on the skills of their people. Skills formation must be demand-based \nand relevant to the national and regional economies and opportunities for work. Skills formation \nis a priority for countries in the Pacific, partly because of the surging numbers of youth who have \ncompleted formal schooling yet lack the practical skills needed by the labor market. Employment \ngrowth and emigration have created skills shortages but there has been a lack of coherent \ndemand  analysis.  This  technical  assistance  (TA)  seeks  to  build  capacity  to  support  the \ndevelopment of demand-based analysis of technical and vocational education and training \n(TVET). The design is based on recommendations included in a major regional review of TVET \nsupported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Skilling the Pacific.1 The design also reflects \nconsultations  undertaken  since  May  2009  with  governments  and  regional  organizations, \nincluding the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community \n(SPC).2 \n \n2.  The proposed TA reflects national, regional, and ADB priorities. The Pacific Plan,3 \npublished by the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in 2005, emphasizes the importance of \nstrengthening vocational and technical training and its links with the labor market. The Pacific \nPlan also includes a cross-cutting strategic objective on improving gender equality. In 2009, a \nregional Pacific education development framework was endorsed by education ministers of the \nPacific Islands Forum. Two of six priorities relate to skills development in TVET and nonformal \neducation and training. In 2009, the ministers of education asked the SPC to look at strategic \nways of supporting TVET to add value to national efforts. The proposed TA is in line with ADB's \nStrategy  2020,  which states  that  \u201cinvestments  in  and  access  to  \u2026 vocational  training  are \nnecessary for more inclusive growth \u2026 ADB will increasingly direct its attention to raising the \nquality of technical vocational education and training.\u201d4 The proposed TA is also in accord with \nthe Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014, which refers to \u201clack of institutional and human capacity \ndevelopment\u201d and \u201clack of skilled and qualified labor\u201d.5 The document includes education and \ntraining as one of four sector priorities and supports more intensive regional cooperation. The \nproposed TA is also aligned with the Revised Pacific Platform for Action on Advancement of \nWomen and Gender Equality 2005\u20132015,6 the 1998 Council of Regional Organisations of the \nPacific Gender Strategy,7 and the 2000 SPC Gender Policy.8 \n \n3.  The design of the TA also takes into account lessons learned from earlier TA projects, \nboth within the region and more widely. Several reviews have underscored the importance of \ncapacity development for human resource development, including a special evaluation study of \nAsian Development Fund operations.9 Of the 17 most common factors explaining poor project \nperformance, deficient capacity building and ownership during project design was among the \nmost frequently cited. The study also underscored the importance of basing project design on \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2008.

The  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Skills development is a powerful mechanism for reducing poverty. Enhancing training \nopportunities and access to skills training can promote entrepreneurship and self-employment \namong the poor. However, thorough demand analysis is needed before policy makers can \nestablish environments in which innovative training strategies, including those supporting public \nand private partnerships, can flourish, thereby promoting inclusive economic growth and social \ndevelopment.  \n \n5.  The challenge for TVET is to adjust the supply of skills in response to changes in \ndemand. Pacific economies are characterized by major imbalances in the demand and supply of \ntechnical and vocational skills. In part, these stem from poor links between TVET and the \nprivate sector. Emigration has exacerbated skills shortages in critical occupations in some \nPacific countries, which have lost skilled people to more developed countries. Other countries \nhave major surpluses of unskilled labor, leading to youth unemployment. Thousands of young \npeople enter the job market annually, either with full or incomplete basic education, but without \nthe practical skills needed by the labor market. Access to skills development is uneven; the  \npoorest segments of the population are the least likely to have opportunities to attend organized \ntraining programs. This is particularly true for the majority of people who work in the informal \neconomy. Training opportunities also tend to be concentrated in urban areas and to focus on \nthose who can afford to pay. Labor markets and employment in the Pacific demonstrate gender \nsegregation and stereotyping which, in turn, are reflected in a gender bias in occupational \ntraining. One of the clear lessons from TVET worldwide is that partnerships must be forged with \nthe private sector, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and private training providers. These \nissues present major management challenges.  \n \n6.  In response to these issues, ADB sponsored a comprehensive review of technical-\nvocational skills development in the Pacific in 2006 and 2007.  Fourteen Pacific countries and \nkey regional agencies collaborated in the study, which was carried out by the Pacific Islands \nForum Secretariat. The final report, Skilling the Pacific, focused on the need to strengthen TVET \norganization  and  management.  The  review  found  that  managers  of  TVET  systems  and \ninstitutions in the Pacific face highly diverse challenges. Federated States of Micronesia, Palau, \nand the Republic of the Marshall Islands face challenges of making TVET systems sustainable. \nIn Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, the issue is to provide skills for income \ngeneration and self-employment for the vast majority working in the informal economy. In Cook \nIslands, Fiji Islands, Samoa, and Tonga, the challenge is to increase training to fill jobs made \nvacant  by  emigrating  labor.  TVET  managers  everywhere  must  raise  the  quality  of  skills \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2008.

However, TVET managers at both the system and \ninstitutional levels have been given few tools and little support to address these challenges. \nMany countries in the region lack strategies and long-term plans for skills development. The \nproposed  TA  seeks  to  raise  management  capacity  to  carry  out  demand  analysis,  identify \nemerging  needs,  and  carry  out  strategic  planning,  in  order  to  address  country-specific \nchallenges. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be increased productivity and incomes, and wider employment \nchoices for women and men, through enhanced skills and reduced skill shortages. The outcome \nof the TA is to raise regional and national capacity to support TVET Frameworks in the Pacific \nthat address private sector demands, the needs of the informal economy and gender equity. At \na national level, the TA will support the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States \nof Micronesia, Timor-Leste, and Tuvalu. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  Building  on  the  recommendations  of  Skilling  the  Pacific,  the  regional  capacity \ndevelopment TA seeks to raise TVET management capacity at national and regional levels. \n \n1.   National Capacity Development  \n \n9.  The primary objective of the proposed regional TA is to build national management \ncapacity and systems within government agencies and national apex TVET organizations so \nthey can deliver relevant and demand-responsive, high-quality skills development frameworks in \nthe Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Timor-Leste, and \nTuvalu. With the exception of Timor-Leste, these countries were identified in Skilling the Pacific, \nas small fragile island states with severe economic constraints and few economic prospects. \nThey all lack a demand-focused national workforce strategy and skills training framework. As a \nresult of the capacity building, it is expected that the apex TVET institutions will be better able to \ndesign demand-responsive TVET frameworks and that training institutions will deliver cost-\neffective  curricula  linked  closely  to  economic  demands.  Through  the  definition  of  clearer \ndemand-based  curricula,  a  sound  basis  can  be  established  for  national  standards  and \nmeasurement  criteria  for  institutional  and  management  effectiveness  and  will  provide  an \nopportunity to analyze flexible supply responses, including the development of private and \npublic-private training. The capacity building will take place in the following main areas.  \n \n10.  National policies and frameworks for skills development. Demand-responsive TVET \nframeworks and curricula for skills development based on robust and thorough national and \nregional labor market analysis are particularly needed in the four countries. National training \nseminars will examine organizational arrangements for skills delivery across a range of possible \nproviders. They will emphasize a flexible approach that recognizes public, private, and faith-\nbased options. On-the-job training and assistance will be provided to selected personnel in \nmethodologies for the development of demand-responsive TVET frameworks. \n \n11.  Labor market information and graduate destination studies. Technical assistance \nwill be provided on methods of analyzing changing skills requirements in national and regional \nlabor markets, and of conducting regular tracer surveys on graduate destinations. This will \n ", "4   \ninclude dissemination of tracer methodologies, such that used by the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development (AusAID) in Samoa, Tonga, and Vanuatu. On-the-job training and \nassistance will be provided to selected personnel on methods, and analysis and application of \ndata.  \n \n12.  Methodologies for informal sector training. Given the predominance of the informal \nsector in the labor markets of most Pacific countries, Skilling the Pacific assigned priority to \ntraining for income generation in the informal sector. Analysis of informal sector opportunities \nshould be an essential element of any national workforce plan. Methodologies for effective \ninformal sector training need to be disseminated and adapted to Pacific conditions, particularly \ngiven the role of women as key actors in labor markets. The TA will support the design of \nstrategies for training in the informal sector, particularly for women and other underserved \ngroups. \n \n2.    Regional Capacity Development  \n   \n13.  The TA will enhance the capacity of two key regional organizations to provide services \non  skills  development:  the  SPC  and  the  Pacific  Association  of  Technical  and  Vocational \nEducation and Training (PATVET). The SPC is the coordinator for TVET in the region and has \nchaired the TVET subcommittee of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific since \n2008. The SPC human development program takes the lead on regional gender equity policies. \nIt also coordinates consultations with development partners on TVET in the Pacific and provides \nthe secretariat for the regional TVET association, PATVET, which includes 12 regular members \nplus associate members and has compiled a register of TVET providers in the region.  \n \n14.  The  TA  will  support  the  SPC  to  (i)  facilitate  technical  assistance  to  governments, \nadministrations and TVET institutions on skills development frameworks at national and regional \nlevels,  and  (ii)  expand  coordination  and  information  sharing  in  the  sector.  It  will  provide \nresources to the SPC and PATVET to help them deliver new TVET support services to their \nmembers  through  the  preparation  of  demand-responsive  frameworks  for  regional  skills \ndevelopment. The capacity of the two organizations will be developed through assistance in the \ndesign of the strategic framework and in the delivery of three regional seminars to support the \nframework. The seminars will also provide an opportunity for PATVET to expand its network to \ninclude countries that are not currently members.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $745,000 equivalent to be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF\u2013other  sources).  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan are given in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. SPC will provide implementation guidance. \nThe TA will finance up to 15 person-months of international consulting services and 18 person-\nmonths of national consulting services (see Appendix 3 for terms of reference for consultants). It \nwill  also  finance  eight national  workshops  on  national  TVET  frameworks,  and  four  market \nanalyses and tracer studies. The TA will finance three regional workshops on the regional TVET \nframework.  \n \n ", "  5\n17.  Consultants will be recruited on an individual basis and employed by ADB in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time.) The \nproceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with the Technical Disbursement Handbook.14 TA \nactivities will be implemented over a 24-month period starting in February 2010. The TA is \nintended to provide the basis for a thorough needs analysis, and, subject to performance, future \nTA projects may support further activities within the four countries or extend existing activities to \nadditional countries. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $745,000 on a grant basis for \nDesigning Demand-Based Technical and Vocational Education and Training Frameworks for \nthe Pacific, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n  \n \n \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2008.
