INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  support  public  debt \nsustainability in Maldives by focusing on institutional strengthening1 for a sound fiscal policy \nframework. It will cover domestic resource mobilization, public investment management, and the \nimplementation of Sustainable Development Finance Policy2 (SDFP) performance and policy \nactions (PPAs). The TA will also support capacity building of the Government of Maldives on fiscal \nsustainability and public debt management. The TA is included in the indicative country pipeline \nand monitoring report 2022\u20132024 and country partnership strategy, 2020\u20132024 for Maldives.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has severely affected the economy. Gross domestic \nproduct (GDP)  is  estimated  to  have  contracted  by  33.5%  in  2020  as  travel, tourism,  and \nconstruction activities were disrupted by pandemic-related restrictions.4 Poverty is estimated to \nhave increased to 7.2% in 2020 from 2.1% before the pandemic.5 With travel and tourism activities \nand related services such as communication, real estate, and entertainment contributing over    \n40% of GDP, 80% of exports, and about 50% of total revenues, Maldives\u2019 economy is sensitive \nto  natural  as  well  as  global  economic,  natural,  and  health  shocks. 6 The  country  relies \ndisproportionately on travel and tourism for economic growth, employment generation, revenue \nmobilization, and external sector stability. \n \n3.  The pandemic has exacerbated fiscal stress. The unprecedented pressure on public \nexpenditure, especially to boost health care spending and social protection, combined with \nforegone revenue because of concessions related to pandemic relief measures as well as \ndeclining  revenue  mobilization,  have  heightened  fiscal  stress.  The  fiscal  burden related to \ncountercyclical support measures was about 5.0% of GDP in 2020 and, as of 14 October 2021, \n1.6% of estimated GDP in 2021. Revenue mobilization contracted by 38.7% in 2020 while \nexpenditure increased by 5.7%, resulting in a fiscal deficit of 27.5% of GDP in 2020, up from just \n6.6% of GDP in 2019. In 2020, public expenditure net lending was 52.8% of GDP and total \nrevenue (including grants) 25.4%. Almost half of the investment required for  public sector \ninvestment programs (PSIPs) is financed by borrowing, often nonconcessional external borrowing \nthat potentially adds to external debt distress. Proper sequencing and prioritization of such \nprojects is essential to ensure that a well-vetted investment project pipeline is consistent with \nfiscal and debt carrying capacities. In recent years, the fiscal deficit has consistently overshot the \nthreshold of 3.5% of GDP and public debt 60.0% of GDP, as specified in Fiscal Responsibility Act \n2013. \n \n4.  High  risk  of  debt  distress.  Challenging  macroeconomic  fundamentals\u2014a  narrow \neconomic and taxpayer base, weak public financial management (PFM), high fiscal and current \naccount  deficits,  and  vulnerability  to  external  and  climatic  shocks\u2014amplify  debt  distress \nvulnerabilities. The country was at a high risk of debt distress even before the pandemic. In its \n \n1  It is consistent with Sustainable Development Goal 16.6. \n2 World  Bank.  2020.

The \nTA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 November 2021. \n4  Nominal GDP was $3.8 billion in 2020, significantly down from $5.6 billion in 2019. \n5  Based on $5.50 per day, which is used as a suitable poverty line for an upper middle-income country; 3.6% of the \npopulation lived below the poverty line in 2016. The World Bank in Maldives (accessed 11 October 2021).  \n6  World Bank. 2021. Maldives Development Update - A Digital Dawn. Washington, DC. \n \n ", "2 \nApril 2020 debt sustainability assessment, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessed \nMaldives\u2019  public  debt  as  sustainable  contingent  on  implementation  of  substantial  fiscal \nconsolidation  strategies  as  committed  in  the  recent  budget  and  macroeconomic  policy \nframeworks.7 However, the country remains at high risk of external debt distress and a high \noverall risk of debt distress. The country\u2019s debt carrying capacity is assessed weak by the IMF.8 \nIt is also facing a challenging time complying with the SDFP PPAs.  Public and publicly guaranteed \ndebt was estimated at 149.3% of GDP as of the end of 2020, a sharp increase from 78.3% of \nGDP  at the  end  of  2019.  The  government  estimated total  outstanding  public  and  publicly \nguaranteed debt would reach 125.2% of GDP in 2021.  \n \n5.  Binding constraints on enhancing debt sustainability. A narrow economic base that \nis vulnerable to economic and natural shocks, and unsustainable financing practices because of \nweak prioritization and inefficient public investment are contributing to Maldives\u2019 increasing debt \nload and high risk of debt distress. Faster growth of public expenditure relative to revenue growth, \ntogether with a high cost of borrowing, poses a binding constraint on a stable macro fiscal \nframework and debt sustainability. In its latest assessment, the IMF underscored the need for \nrevenue mobilization,  expenditure rationalization,  PFM  reforms,  and  a  comprehensive  debt \nmanagement strategy for medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability.9   \n \n6.  Public investment management is weak. High public expenditure is partly the result of \nthe inclusion of mega infrastructure projects as well as other ad hoc projects without cost\u2013benefit \nanalysis and proper due diligence, implying a weak public investment management process. \nBetter prioritization of public spending is crucial to reducing debt rollover or refinancing risks, \nwhich  carry  high  interest  costs,  and  lowering  debt  vulnerabilities.  Specifically,  screening, \nprioritization, and sequencing of PSIPs are important to ensure that capital spending is consistent \nwith available fiscal resources and the high debt distress situation. There is a need for rigorous \nand clearly defined eligibility criteria, a credible risk assessment process, timely monitoring and \nrecording, and auditing standards. This will be helpful in selecting prioritized projects that yield \nhigh return on investment, and also in enhancing the credibility of budget allocation, especially in \nreducing the tendency to overbudget for large PSIPs that ties up funds that could be better utilized \nelsewhere. When approved PSIPs investments are not realized, the government often transfers \nthem to fund recurrent spending, resulting in excessive virement. \n \n7.  Domestic  resource  mobilization  is  constrained  by  low  compliance  and  audit \ncapacity. Higher revenue10 mobilization is constrained by weak taxpayer compliance and audit \ncapacities of the authorities.11 Noncompliance in the case of goods and services tax was as high \nas 32% in 2019. The revenue administration needs compliance risk management strategies and \nguidelines using regulatory powers to increase voluntary compliance and to deter noncompliance. \nCompliance can also be enforced through systematic and efficient audits, including digital forensic \nassessments, as these help to deter fraudulent practices and tax evasion. A strong cyber security \nbackbone will encourage hesitant taxpayers to file income tax returns online and help reduce \nrevenue administration costs. Strengthening compliance risk management and digital forensic \nassessment capacity will enhance the efficiency of revenue administration as well. \n \n \n7  IMF. 2020.

The TA is aligned with the government\u2019s priority to lower debt \ndistress and improve fiscal management to support the implementation of the Strategic Action \nPlan 2019\u20132023.12 The TA is also consistent with the government\u2019s Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy \n2021\u20132023 and the upcoming PFM Reform Strategy 2021\u20132025.13 The TA contributes to the \nfollowing  operational  priorities:  strengthening  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  and \naccelerating  progress  in  gender  equality.  The  proposed  activities  are  designed  in  close \ncoordination with development partners. \n \n9.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will build on its past engagement14 and complement \nongoing assistance to the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Maldives Inland Revenue Authority \n(MIRA) to improve expenditure management and revenue administration. It will focus on areas of \nimmediate and strategic priorities that address binding constraints to lower debt distress. To \naddress the other remaining constraints on a sound PFM regime required to put Maldives on a \nsustainable debt path, ADB, in consultation with development partners, may consider additional \nTA  support  and  policy-based  grant  assistance.  Furthermore,  areas  for  strengthening  tax \nadministration and digitalization will be identified in consultation with the ADB Tax Hub. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: debt vulnerabilities and overall debt reduced.15 \nThe TA will have the following outcome: fiscal policy framework improved.16  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Domestic resource mobilization and revenue administration policies and \nstrategies strengthened. The TA will support MIRA to improve taxpayer compliance and tax \nadministration efficiency, and broaden the taxpayer base. Specifically, it will support analytical \nstudies on review of existing taxpayer compliance policies and tax administration capacity and \nrecommend ways to improve them. This will also include assessment of local councils' capacity \non  revenue  mobilization  and  harmonization  of  the  tax-administration-related  information \ntechnology (IT) systems of MIRA and local councils. The TA will support capacity building and \ninstallation of digital forensic equipment to strengthen risk management and the investigative \nfunction of MIRA.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Public investment and expenditure management policies and strategies \nstrengthened. The TA will support the assessment of guidelines to identify, appraise, select, and \nprioritize  investment  projects  to  enable  uniform,  coordinated,  and  harmonized  investment \nmanagement across ministries and at the subnational level. It will also support a study to \nstreamline the process of prioritizing investment projects funded through the Maldives Green \nFund and Maldives Fund Management Corporation. Support, including training, will also be \nprovided to enhance public expenditure audit capacity\u2014particularly at the Auditor General's \n \n12 Government of Maldives. 2019.

Output  3:  Identification  and  implementation  of  the  Sustainable  Development \nFinance  Policy  performance  and  policy  actions  supported.  The  TA  will  support  the \nidentification and implementation of SDFP PPAs. The PPAs will be identified in close coordination \nwith the World Bank and the government. This will broadly be under three areas: strengthening \nfiscal sustainability, increasing debt transparency, and improving debt management. The TA will \nalso support preparation of a comprehensive debt management strategy to manage fiscal risks \nfrom large infrastructure projects and state-owned enterprises. Training programs to enhance \nanalytical capacity on the PPAs will also be conducted. \n \n14.  The selective implementation of recommendations of the analytical studies, as agreed \nwith the government; installation of IT equipment; and institutional capacity building will help to \nboost  revenue,  lower  borrowing  requirements,  and  ensure  quality  at  entry  during  budget \npreparation processes, leading to cost savings as well as allocative efficiency. This in turn will \ncontribute to an improved fiscal policy framework and enhanced debt sustainability. ADB's value \naddition  includes  assessing  digital  solutions  and  sustainability  of  reform  initiatives  through \nselective, tailor-made capacity building. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,320,000, of which $1,200,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-7).17 The Government of Maldives will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, and other in-\nkind contributions. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The MOF will be the executing agency.
