The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program, initiated by the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) in 1997, has evolved into a multicountry and multi-institutional \nframework  that  comprises  eight  participating  countries  (Afghanistan,1  Azerbaijan,  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan) and an \nalliance  of  six  multilateral  institutions  (ADB,  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment,  International  Monetary  Fund,  Islamic  Development  Bank,  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, and World Bank), with ADB servising as program Secretariat. At the \ncore of the Program lies the overall institutional framework (OIF), which consists of (i) an annual \nministerial conference (MC) that provides overall guidance and makes policy and directional \ndecisions, (ii) senior officials\u2019 meeting (SOM) that coordinates on cross-sectoral issues and \nprepares for the ministerial conference, (iii) sectoral coordinating committees (SCCs) at the \noperational level that coordinate sectorwide issues and implementation, and (iv) a national focal \npoint in each participating country to ensure effective coordination among government agencies \nand other parties concerned.  \n \n2.  At the 4TH MC on CAREC in November 2005, the ministers renewed their commitment to \nregional  cooperation,  reconfirmed  the  basic  principles2  of  the  OIF,  and  agreed  that  the \nprocessing and implementation of regional initiatives should be accelerated.  \n \n3.  ADB adopted in 2004 the CAREC Member Countries Regional Cooperation Strategy \nand Program 2005\u20132007 (RCSP).3 The RCSP enshrined the establishment in 2002 of the OIF \nas a milestone in the partnership and trust among program participants (footnote 3, para. 72). \nFurther  strengthening  of  the  OIF  forms  part  of  ADB\u2019s  expanded  program  for  regional \ncooperation  (footnote  3,  Figure  1,  p.  24),  which  is  critical  to  achieving  the  four  strategic \nobjectives of the CAREC Program.4 To this end, the assistance pipeline for nonlending products \nand services as envisaged by the RCSP included the Greater Silk Road Initiative 2006. The \ntechnical assistance (TA) design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.   As  initiator  of  the  CAREC  Program  and  program  Secretariat,  ADB  approved  from \nOctober 2000 to June 2005 eleven loans totaling $275.1 million for seven regional investment \nprojects, and 23 CAREC-related TA projects totaling $17.4 million. ADB has also leveraged \ncofinancing amounting to $140.7 million for three projects.  \n \n5.  In  light  of  ADB\u2019s  policy  paper  on  regional  cooperation,6  the  CAREC  Program  has \nfollowed a phased approach, which started with background economic analysis and institutions \nassessment,  focused  thereafter  on  identification  and  prefeasibility  analysis  of  investment \nprojects, and then expanded to support for policy dialogue and institution development.  \n                                                 \n1  Afghanistan joined the CAREC Program as a full participant at the CAREC Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting in October \n2005. \n2  Including consensus, pragmatism, and results orientation. \n3  ADB. 2004. Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Member Countries Regional Cooperation Strategy and \nProgram (2005\u20132007). Manila (Doc. IN.158-04). \n4  That is, (i) increasing trade and integration with large markets, both globally and in the region\u2019s proximity; (ii) \nimproving economic cooperation within the region to reduce costs of transport and facilitate transit; (iii) improving \nsupplies of energy; and (iv) tackling negative externalities. \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 17 June 2005. \n6  ADB. 1994. Bank Support for Regional Cooperation. Manila (Doc. R60-94). \n ", "2   \n6.  Prior to this TA, a number of \u201cumbrella\u201d regional technical assistance (RETAs) were \napproved and implemented for the CAREC Program, including those for the development and \ncontinuous functioning of its OIF.7 Major lessons learned from these RETAs are the following: (i) \nregional cooperation is a long process that calls for sustained political will and mutual trust; (ii) \nlack of proper understanding of the actual benefits and costs of regional cooperation constitutes \nan obstacle in promoting regional cooperation; (iii) institutional and capacity development is \nurgently required for the success of the regional initiative; and (iv) there is need to show tangible \nand concrete results from key regional projects to further advance regional cooperation.8 At the \nsame time, it is also noted that promoting regional cooperation is resource intensive, though in \nthe long term the efforts made and costs incurred could be more than compensated by more \nefficient economy of the region, sustained economic growth of the participating countries, and \nhigher living standards of their people.  \n \n7.  During the period 2004\u20132005, regional cooperation under the CAREC Program has \nmaintained its momentum and made further achievements, including (i) the successful holding \nof the 3RD MC in November 2004 and the 4TH MC in November 2005, where ministers of the \nparticipating  countries  provided  specific  guidance  on  further  direction  and  activities  of  the \nCAREC Program; (ii) strengthened coordination among the MIs in the CAREC framework; (iii) \ndiscussion at the SOM in April 2005 and general consensus on a number of key strategic \nquestions facing CAREC, including geographic and program scope, treatment of policy agenda, \npositioning  of  CAREC  vis-\u00e0-vis  other  regional  initiatives,  effectiveness  and  results-based \norientation of the Program, and promotion of private sector participation; (iv) progress made in \nall priority areas of the Program; and (v) provision of lending and nonlending assistance to \nsupport regional cooperation in Central Asia.9  \n \n8.  Despite the progress so far, many important challenges that remain or are emerging \nneed to be properly addressed if the CAREC Program is to achieve more tangible results: (i) the \nbenefits of regional cooperation need to be understood better and by a wider audience; (ii) \nmutual trust among CAREC countries needs to be further enhanced, including at sector and \nworking levels where political will and in-principle agreement on regional economic cooperation \nhave to be translated into concrete and concerted efforts in implementation; (iii) there is need for \nthe  OIF  to  be  further  consolidated  and  results-oriented,  from  which  CAREC  participating \ncountries could find sustained enthusiasm and momentum for regional economic cooperation, \nand on which the MIs will continue to set the foundation of their alliance; and (iv) though the \nCAREC  Program  remains  highly  relevant  for  the  participating  countries,  the  development \nassistance community must recognize that regional cooperation in such a politically and socially \nsensitive region as Central Asia requires realistic targets and approaches, and sustained and \nlong-term financial support. \n \n9.  In view of the imperative need for regional cooperation and the progress that has been \nmade by the CAREC Program, and to overcome difficulties and challenges faced, the CAREC \nparticipating countries have been calling upon ADB to play a greater role in regional cooperation \n                                                 \n7  These include (i) ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for the Greater Silk Road Initiative. Manila (TA 6053-REG, \napproved in October 2002 with ADB financing totaling $950,000); and (ii) ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for the \nGreater Silk Road Initiative 2005. Manila (TA 6199-REG, approved in November 2004 with ADB financing totaling \n$900,000). \n8  ADB. 2004.

IN.235-04). \n9  ADB alone approved in 2004 four loan projects totaling $88.1 million and nine TAs for $4.95 million. \n ", "  3\nin Central Asia. This call points to the need for ADB to continue supporting the OIF of the \nCAREC.  \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s TA for the OIF must however be designed and implemented taking into account \nlessons learned from previous TAs (para. 6) and following understanding reached at the most \nrecent MCs and SOMs: (i) the OIF of the CAREC Program should continue to operate based on \nthe principle of consensus among the participating countries and MIs, retaining its flexibility and \nat the same time its unique identity vis-\u00e0-vis other regional programs and institutions; (ii) to more \neffectively use resources and avoid duplication, further coordination/rationalization should be \nexplored  and  carried  out  between  the  CAREC  Program  and  other  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives including the Central and South Asia Transport and Trade Forum (CSATTF)10 and \nother regional programs for Central Asia espoused by ADB\u2019s major multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment  partners;  (iii)  cooperation  with  key  neighboring  countries  (e.g.  the  Russian \nFederation) is getting more and more important for the continuous success and further advance \nof  the  CAREC  Program;  (iv)  more  analytical  works  and  tangible  results  are  needed  for \nenhancing confidence in and moving forward with regional cooperation in Central Asia; and (v) \nparticipation of the private sector in CAREC  activities will infuse the Program  with a new \ndimension and revived impetus. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA is expected to contribute to economic growth and better living standards in the \nCAREC participating countries through regional economic cooperation. The outcome of the TA \nwill be a strengthened OIF for further progress and tangible results of the CAREC Program. The \noutcome will be achieved through the following major outputs: (i) policy and strategic guidance \nprovided by the MC and SOMs for further deepening and advancing the CAREC Program; (ii) \nprogram and analytical works on regional cooperation, including a comprehensive action plan \n(CAP) and performance indicators; (iii) engagement of the private sector with the CAREC \nprogram; and (iv) dissemination of knowledge and information on CAREC activities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will focus on strengthening the OIF, which lies at the core of the CAREC \nProgram, and on supporting related programming works and analytical studies that will help \nguide the general direction of the CAREC Program. On the other hand, as an umbrella TA for \nthe CAREC Program, appropriate flexibility will be applied in implementation to cope with the \nevolving  nature  of  CAREC  and  to  respond  to  the  changing  demands  of  its  participating \ncountries. The following key activities that will generate the expected outputs will be funded by \nthe TA. \n \n13.  Facilitating and Enhancing Regional Dialogue. ADB has proved to be well-positioned \nto initiate, facilitate, and enhance frank and constructive dialogues on regional cooperation \namong  CAREC  countries,  because  of  its  neutral  status  as  a  multilateral  international \norganization focusing on economic development and poverty reduction, and because it serves \nas program Secretariat. Playing this role entails financial support for preparing and holding \n                                                 \n10 CSATTF was established in 2003 at its first Ministerial Conference with a membership of Afghanistan, Iran, \nPakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan to strengthen transport and trade links through improved transit \ncorridors of the subregion, which connect Central Asia and South Asia and the ports of the Arabian Sea and the \nPersian Gulf through Afghanistan. \n ", "4   \nmeetings and conferences of the OIF of CAREC, and providing related secretariat services. The \nTA will prepare and support the holding of the 5TH MC in the last quarter of 2006, at least two \nSOMs prior to the 5TH MC, as well as a number of SCC meetings and other pertinent high-level \nforums  under  the  OIF.  The  TA  will  also  support  coordination  between  the  OIF  and  other \ninitiatives for regional cooperation in Central Asia, to minimize duplication and secure synergy \nbetween different initiatives. In connection with the need to coordinate and assist with CAREC-\nrelated  projects  and  to  monitor  other  regional  initiatives  in  the  field,  the  TA  will  fund  one \ndomestic consultant/regional cooperation coordinator in each resident mission (RM) of ADB in \nCAREC participating countries.   \n \n14.  Conducting Analytical Works and Results-Oriented Planning in Support of the \nOIF. As a regional cooperation platform that is gaining ground and recognition, the CAREC \nProgram is bound to expand its activities, with possible broadening of its sector/subsector \ncoverage. For that reason, more analytical works11 will be conducted in support of the OIF, for it \nto make well-informed and realistic decisions based on a good grasp of the potential benefits, \ndrawbacks,  and  risks  involved  in  the  issues  and  related  options  discussed.  Comparative \nanalysis of experience and lessons learned in similar areas from other initiatives for regional \ncooperation, either in Central Asia or elsewhere in the world, will also be useful for the OIF in its \ndecision-making process. In addition, as reconfirmed by the 4TH MC in November 2005, it is time \nto set up key performance indicators for the CAREC Program, which should be embodied in a \nCAP. The TA will support analytical and planning works in these areas.   \n \n15.  Promoting Private Sector Participation in the CAREC Program. A call for greater \nparticipation of the private sector in the CAREC Program was made by the CAREC SOM in \nApril 2004 and in April 2005. The call envisaged two major thrusts: (i) launching and regular \nconvening  of  the  Regional  Business  Roundtable  (RBR);  and  (ii)  development  and \nimplementation of the strategy note for CAREC private sector development.  \n \n16.  The major objectives of the RBR include (i) enhancing business inputs into CAREC by \nproviding direct and regular channels for the private sector to communicate with the participating \ngovernments on broad issues in the priority areas of the CAREC Program, as well as on specific \nprojects and initiatives; (ii) facilitating the development of soft and hard infrastructure for regional \ntrade and investment; and (iii) building networks of the business community in the countries \nconcerned to encourage cooperation and cofinancing in subregional projects and other related \nregional initiatives. An RBR preparatory meeting was convened in early November 2005, which \nofficially launched the RBR that will be held annually starting from 2006.  \n \n17.  The strategy note for CAREC private sector development aims at improving the policy, \nlegal, and regulatory environment, as well as services in support of private sector development \nin  the  CAREC  economies.  The  major  approach  envisaged  includes  enhancing  the  role  of \nbusiness associations and chambers of commerce in the participating countries. The approach \nentails developing a much greater range of activities to benefit members of the chambers and \nother  related  parties,  and  enhancing  the  role  of  the  chambers  in  reflecting  business \nperspectives in national policy making and in regional economic cooperation.  \n  \n18.  Enhancing Dissemination of Knowledge and Information on CAREC Activities.  \nOver the years, the CAREC Program has generated a wealth of studies and knowledge on \ncross-country issues in Central Asia, particularly in the priority areas of transport, energy, trade \n                                                 \n11 Such as the study on the competitiveness of Central Asian states, and a multicountry general equilibrium model \ninvolving PRC, Mongolia, Russia, and Uzbekistan. \n ", "  5\npolicy, and trade facilitation. Furthermore, day-to-day activities under the CAREC framework are \nbringing  about  new  or  additional  knowledge  and  information.  Wider  and  more  systematic \ndissemination of knowledge and information on CAREC activities will help consolidate the OIF \nthrough reinforced trust in regional cooperation, better understanding of the role assumed and \nworks undertaken by CAREC, and larger support from stakeholders. The TA will continue to   \nsupport the revamped CAREC website, and the preparation and circulation of the quarterly \nregional newsletters in addition to Central Asia Regional News Digest. In light of the newly \napproved public communications policy of ADB,12 the TA will support translation of selected key \nreports and studies or their summaries into Russian and Chinese. In consultation with the \nDepartment of External Relations and the RMs concerned, other means of communications will \nbe explored as appropriate for enhancing external outreach and dissemination. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.05 million equivalent. ADB will finance $985,000 on a \ngrant basis from ADB's TA funding program. The participating governments will provide the \nremaining $65,000 equivalent, equal to the imputed value of staff time and use of government \nfacilities conducting activities under the TA. Detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months, from 1 January 2006 to 31 March 2007. \nADB will be the Executing Agency. ADB\u2019s CAREC unit in the Operations Coordination Division \nwill be responsible for overall implementation of TA activities in light of the guidance and specific \nrequirements of the CAREC MCs and SOMs. To ensure effective implementation of the TA, \nthere  will  be  close  coordination  with  the  national  focal  point  in  each  CAREC  participating \ncountry, other MIs in the CAREC framework, SCCs, and ADB\u2019s RMs concerned.  \n \n21.  For implementation of this TA, seven person-months of international consulting services \nwill be engaged, on an intermittent basis, to assist with analytical works and results-oriented \nplanning. In addition, 120 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required for \ncoordination, country reporting, knowledge dissemination, and technical support for the CAREC \nSecretariat, including 12 person-months for one regional cooperation coordinator in each RM \nlocated in the CAREC participating countries. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance \nwith its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging  domestic  consultants.  An  outline  of  the  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  is  in \nAppendix 3. The equipment budgeted under the TA consists of a strictly limited number of \ncomputers that will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and will \nbe left with the Executing Agency at the completion of the TA.    \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $985,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Greater Silk Road Initiative 2006, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n12 ADB. 2005.
