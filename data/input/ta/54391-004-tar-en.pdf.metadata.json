Increasing  financial and  non-financial  solutions  targeting  gender  equality  can boost \neconomic growth, bolster well-being to all stakeholders, and create compelling opportunities for \ninvestment1. Evidence from recent research suggests that promoting a business culture that \ninvests in  women beyond social  responsibility  standards  by incorporating  a gender lens  in \nbusiness results in a double benefit through both improving the lives of women and girls and \ngenerating higher economic returns.2 \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) \nworks to  benefit  ADB\u2019s private  sector  clients  while  driving  gender  equality  and  women\u2019s \nempowerment in Asia and the Pacific in alignment with ADB Operational Plan for Priority 2: \nAccelerating Progress in Gender Equality, 2019\u201320243. \n3.  In  January  2020,  ADB  approved  the  establishment  of  ADB  Ventures  Financing \nPartnership Facility (ADB Ventures), which supports and invests in early-stage companies with \ntechnology-enabled solutions that contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, \nreferred to as \u201cImpact Technologies,\u201d and notably contribute to climate change mitigation and \ngender equality. ADB Venture currently includes the ADB Ventures investment fund 1 (fund 1) \nand the ADB Ventures technical assistance. \n4.  The  proposed  Technical  Assistance  (TA)  Subproject  for  ADB  Ventures  Gender \nMainstreaming (hereafter the TA Subproject) is designed to deliver quality capacity to design and \nimplement gender measures across ADB Ventures operations.  \n \nI.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \n \nA.  Overall Progress of the Technical Assistance Cluster \n \n5.  This TA Subproject follows the recent approval of the TA for Gender Mainstreaming and \nGender Initiatives in Nonsovereign Operations Cluster report (TA Cluster), which preliminary \ncomprises of five subprojects: (i) support private sector projects categorized Effective Gender \nMainstreaming or Gender Equity Theme under ADB categorization system in the implementation \nof their gender action plans; (ii) increase women\u2019s access to finance in the Pacific for women \nbusinesses through the WAVES Program; (iii) enhance gender mainstreaming in climate finance \nprojects under the Australian Climate Financing Partnership; (iv) develop knowledge and tools to \npromote gender-lens financing by financial institutions; and (v) enhance gender mainstreaming in \nventure capital financing operations.  The TA Cluster specifies that the subprojects  are not \nmutually dependent  and may be presented  and  approved in any order.  Not all  these five \nsubprojects may materialize and/or additional subprojects may be developed over the course of \nthe TA Cluster.  \n \n \n \n1 Christie D.

The TA Subproject aims to provide support to the ADB Ventures Team, and its clients, to \nensure  high quality gender mainstreaming in new funds, investment projects and technical \nassistance grants when applicable. The focus of the TA Subproject is to conduct project reviews \nand gender analysis, define gender action plans in the processing and administration of projects, \nand design guidelines for gender mainstreaming in ADB Venture projects. \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs and Activities \n \nOutput 1:  Increased  capacity  of ADB Ventures to  deliver transformational,  industry-\nspecific gender measures \n \n7.  The TA will serve to support ADB Ventures to better integrate gender elements into the \nproject identification and project design.  \n \n8.  Expected activities under Output 1 may include: \n\u2022  Reviews and contributions in project preparation documents and during due diligence \nto strengthen the transactions\u2019 gender value proposition; \n\u2022  Monitoring of the implementation of gender action plans for ADB Ventures projects, to \nimprove on effective understanding and reporting on the gender measures; \n\u2022  Production of guidelines  on gender mainstreaming in targeted industries  to better \ninform the gender design. \n \nOutput 2: Generation of knowledge \n \n9.  The TA Subproject will seek to increase ADB Ventures\u2019 stakeholders understanding of \ngender-lens  or  gender-smart  investing  and  how  gender  mainstreaming  applies  to  their \nbusinesses. \n \n10.  Expected activities under Output 2 may include: \n\u2022  Production of case studies and good business practices in targeted industries. \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA Subproject is estimated to cost USD 75,000, which will be financed on a grant-\nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-others)4. The key expenditure are \nindividual consultant fees, as listed in Appendix 1.  \n \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The TA Subproject will run for an initial period of two years from March 2021 to February \n2023. ADB\u2019s PSOD gender team, which is part of the Private Sector Transaction Support division, \nwill administer the TA and will recruit and manage the individual consultant. Implementation of \nthe TA activities will be conducted in consultation with ADB Ventures Team. The TA resources \nwill be disbursed  following ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as \namended from time to time)\n \n4 Subproject 3 funding will be transferred from TA 9948-REG: ADB Ventures Technical Assistance, for which a minor \nchange in TA scope and implementation arrangements has been approved to cancel TASF funds of USD 75,000 \nfrom TA 9948 and transfer the amount to the C-TRTA  for Gender Mainstreaming and Gender Initiatives in \nNonsovereign Operations \u2013 approval Memo is attached in Appendix 2. \n ", "3 \n \n \n \n13.
