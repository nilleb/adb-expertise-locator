I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) proposed \nloans, and (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Multi-Donor Clean \nEnergy Fund1 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility, all to the Democratic \nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Clean Energy and Network Efficiency Improvement \nProject. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building for \nClean Power Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loans and administration of \nthe grant, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The  project2 includes  three  components:  (i)  transmission  infrastructure;  (ii)  network \nefficiency  improvements;  and  (iii)  pilot  solar  rooftop  power  generation  investments  in  the \nEastern, North Central, Central, Northern, Southern, and Western provinces of the country.3  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT  \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Sri Lanka has achieved a substantial improvement in the energy sector, with a national \nelectrification ratio of 91% in 2011 compared with 29% in 1990. The longer-term challenge for \nthe country is to reduce its high dependence on expensive fossil fuel energy. The energy sector \nstruggles to meet growing demand for electricity at sufficiently low cost and acceptable reliability \nlevels.4 The share of thermal energy in the power generation mix has increased from 6% in \n1995 to 54% in 2011. Demand growth has been generally met by expensive oil-fired thermal \ngeneration, which is not the solution to the country\u2019s energy security and environment protection \nin  the  long  term.  Diversification  of  the  generation  mix\u2014including  from  renewable  energy \nsources, improvement of network efficiency, and supply and demand side management\u2014can \nhelp to address this issue. To enable future planned power supply increases, meet growing \ndemand in the regions, and integrate renewable energy sources into the grid, it is necessary to \nstrengthen the transmission network, especially in conflict-affected areas of the Northern and \nEastern provinces.5 Another challenge is to improve system reliability and reduce technical \nlosses. An enhanced 33 kilovolt (kV) medium voltage network is needed to expand power \nsupply in rural areas, where many poor households remain unconnected or have poor quality of \nelectricity  supplies.  The  new  infrastructure  will  also  support  development  of  clean  energy. \nImprovement of transmission and distribution infrastructure will address electricity needs in the \npost-conflict areas and directly contribute to their development.6 The government intends to \n                                                 \n1  Administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).

Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for Clean Energy \nand Network Efficiency Improvement Project. Manila (TA 7837-SRI, for $1 million, approved on 20 July 2012, and \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \u2500 [TASF-IV]).  \n3  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n4  The problem tree analysis is in Sector Assessment (Summary): Energy (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n5  The current electrification rate in the Northern province is estimated at 80%; Mannar district, where project \nactivities will be undertaken, has an electrification rate of 63%. The current electrification rate in the Eastern \nprovince is 76%. \n6  ADB also provides support to address post-conflict electricity needs in the Northern province by financing an \nenergy sector component, including a transmission line to be constructed from Kilinochchi to Chunnakam and a \ngrid substation at Chunnakam (ADB. 2010.

ADB\u2019s Sustainable Power Sector Support Project finances rural electrification in \nAmpara district of the Eastern province (ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of ", "2 \nimprove  the  energy  sector  performance  and  continue  pursuing  financial,  managerial,  and \ninstitutional reforms in line with the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, 2009. \n \n4.  The project fits Sri Lanka\u2019s national and sector priorities stated in the country\u2019s 10-Year \nDevelopment  Framework  of  2006.7 These  include  infrastructure  development  to  accelerate \neconomic growth and narrow regional disparities, sustainable development of energy resources, \nand access to and reliable delivery of electricity services at competitive prices. The framework is \nbased on the government\u2019s National Energy Policy and Strategies. The government updated \nthis development framework in 2010.8 The updated framework has a comprehensive sector \ndevelopment road map, a long-term investment program, and policy and reform measures. In \nparticular, the new government strategy aims to (i) increase power supply capacity to about \n3,500 megawatts (MW) by 2012 and 6,400 MW by 2020 and reduce the generation cost by \nadding aggregate base load capacity of about 2,000 MW of three coal-fired plants; (ii) increase \nthe share in grid energy supply from nonconventional renewable energy sources from 4.1% in \n2007 to 7.0% by 2012, 10.0% by 2016, and 20.0% by 2020; and (iii) reduce the total technical \nand commercial losses in the network from 14.6% in 2009 to 14.0% by 2012, 13.0% by 2016, \nand 12.0% by 2020. \n \n5.  The project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership \nstrategy for Sri Lanka.9 It will support sustainable development of the energy sector in line with \nthe national and sector priorities.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The project will contribute to a reliable, adequate, and affordable power supply for \nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. The outcome will be increased clean power \nsupply, and improved efficiency and reliability in the delivery of electricity. \n \nC.  Outputs \n7.

The government has requested (i) a loan of $100 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources (OCR), (ii) a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR19,994,000 from the Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF), and (iii) a grant of $1.5 million from the Multi-Donor CEF under \nCEFPF to help finance the project. The ADF loan will finance transmission infrastructure in the \nNorthern province. The transmission and distribution network efficiency improvement will be \nfinanced from the OCR loan. The solar rooftop power generation pilot subprojects will be \nfinanced by the grant and a credit line of $1.5 million from the OCR loan.  \n \n10.  The OCR loan will have a 20-year term, including a grace period of 5 years, a straight-\nline repayment method, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nthe interest and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan,12 and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements.13 The government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility based on these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its \nown independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \n11.

Project implementation units (PIUs) will be set up in CEB and SEA. Full-time managers \nwill  supervise  each  component.  The  PIUs  will  oversee  procurement,  accounting,  quality \nassurance, and social and environmental issues. The PIUs will coordinate closely with the \nprocurement committee, appointed by the cabinet or MOPE, depending on the size of the \ncontracts.  \n \n15.  ADB approved advance contracting of procurement being proposed for goods and civil \nworks. The government has been advised that ADB\u2019s approval of advance contracting does not \ncommit ADB to finance any part of this project. \n \n16.

The TA will examine the potential for clean energy generation from renewable sources. It \nwill also study and prepare (i) system stability and network planning; (ii) a medium-term master \nplan for renewable energy; (iii) a master plan for a wind park; (iv) public\u2013private partnership \noptions for developing renewable energy; and (v) institutional capacity proposed for CEB and \nSEA.   \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n19.  A technical assessment demonstrated the prepared technology to be consistent with \nbest practice. The investment plan estimates, and the operating cost and structure once the \ninvestments are made, were examined and found to be appropriate.  The investment proposal \nfits  the  specifications  associated  with  the  current  asset  base  for  the  transmission  and \ndistribution network in the project areas. The investments may not place an undue burden on \nCEB. However, CEB needs to improve significantly its financial base, financial performance, \noperating systems, and overall efficiency levels. An independent study is planned to tackle \nthese shortcomings. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n20.  The economic internal rate of return16 was calculated by comparing with- and without-\nproject  scenarios.  Detailed  cost\u2013benefit  calculations  confirm  the  economic  viability  and \nsustainability of the investments. The economic internal rate of return is 12.16%. A sensitivity \nand risk analysis demonstrates a robust economic performance. \n \n21.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR)17 is 10.99%. Financial viability was examined \nby comparing the incremental costs and benefits on a with- and without-investment basis. The \nweighted average cost of capital was calculated for each subproject and for the overall project. \nFinancial viability was assessed by comparing the weighted average cost of capital to the FIRR \nfor each subproject and for the aggregated project. The sensitivity of the FIRR to adverse \nmovements in the underlying assumptions was also assessed and found to be robust.  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n22.  CEB is a vertically integrated utility delinked from the regulatory framework. The Sri \nLanka Electricity Act, 2009 encourages efficiency improvements of CEB by regulating each of \nits  six  functional  business  units  (FBUs).  The  2009  Act  empowered  the  Public  Utilities \nCommission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), an independent regulator for the energy and water sectors \nestablished under the PUCSL Act, 2002, to regulate electricity supply industry. PUCSL started \nregulating each FBU separately and has issued individual licenses for that purpose. Financial \naccounts are segregated to allow each FBU to operate as a profit center, and a transfer pricing \nscheme between FBUs is in place. The CEB board delegates to the heads of each FBU day-to-\nday  management  decision  making.  Subsequent  to  the  introduction  of  the  2009  Act,  ADB \napproved  a  Clean  Energy  and  Access  Improvement  Project18 in  2009,  which,  along  with \ninvestments in physical infrastructure, was designed to bring about sector reforms.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans, Grant, \nAdministration of Grant, and Technical Assistance Grant to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \nClean Energy and Access Improvement Project. Manila. \n ", "7 \nestablished a tariff methodology and a road map for tariff reforms and rebalancing. This work is \nsuccessful  but  more  is  to  be  done.  Two  tariff  filings  have  been  conducted  and  tariff \ndeterminations were announced in January 2011 and July 2011. As a result, PUCSL\u2019s capacity \nto carry out its functions has been strengthened.  \n \n23.  CEB has the necessary capacity to undertake the project. CEB was the implementing \nagency for past ADB-financed projects. It has also managed investments funded by other \ndevelopment partners. A financial management assessment of CEB concluded that it can fulfill \nADB\u2019s fiduciary requirements for the project. CEB regularly faces cash shortfalls because of low \ntariffs and expensive power generation and it has expensive short-term loans. Both of these \nshortcomings  need  to  be  corrected.  The  government  remains  committed  to  energy  sector \nreforms. Under the 2009 Act, all tariffs must reflect costs; the Treasury will bear the cost of any \nsubsidy approved by the government. In March 2008, the government introduced a new tariff \nstructure that increased average retail tariffs by 30%. The government has also restructured a \nportion of CEB\u2019s long-term debt. The tariff order issued by PUCSL in January 2011 increased \nthe  average  electricity  tariff  by  about  8%.  In  February  2012,  PUCSL  implemented  a  fuel \nadjustment formula for certain customer categories. With the introduction of low-cost generation, \nit is expected that it will be possible to achieve cost recovery from 2017. Details of CEB\u2019s \nfinancial management assessment are available in the project administration manual and in the \nassessment of CEB\u2019s past financial performance and projections.19 \n \n24.  SEA has received considerable capacity development  assistance from development \npartners, including ADB20 and Japan International Cooperation Agency, and will be undertaking \ntechnical due diligence of applications for the solar rooftop power generation pilot subprojects. \nThe agency can manage the proposed grant and credit line. \n \n25.  All  procurement  under  the  project  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Recruitment of consultants will \nbe in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Open competitive bidding will be followed. An oversight role by ADB will ensure \nintegrity in procurement and implementation activities. CEB and SEA maintain a project website \nthat will be updated regularly and will include (i) bidding procedures, bidders, and contract \nawards; (ii) use of the funds disbursed under the project; and (iii) physical progress. ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment,  MOPE,  CEB,  and  SEA.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n \n26.  The project will contribute to sustainable economic development, poverty reduction, and \nsocial well-being21 through increased access to electricity, reduction of system losses, and \nimprovement in the quality of power. Greater access to a stable supply of electricity will promote \n                                                 \n19  Ceylon  Electricity  Board\u2019s  Past  Financial  Performance  and  Projections  (accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n20  ADB. 2007.

The project is expected \nto generate jobs for skilled and unskilled laborers during construction. Improved access to \nelectricity and better supply quality will also enhance the living standards of rural households. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n  1.  Social Safeguards \n \n27.  None of the project components will have any significant social safeguard impacts. The \ntransmission and distribution lines primarily cross public and unused lands. Where croplands \nare affected, adequate compensation will be paid. Project construction will be carried out during \nthe crop off-seasons. Where new grid substations are built on commercial and private lands, \nadequate compensation will be paid to their owners. The project is classified category B for \ninvoluntary  resettlement  impacts.  CEB  prepared  a  resettlement  plan  for  the  transmission \ninfrastructure  and  transmission  and  distribution  efficiency  improvement  components.22 The \nproject is classified category C for impacts on indigenous peoples.  \n \n  2.  Environmental Safeguards \n \n28.  CEB and SEA have prepared initial environmental examinations23 for their components \nand held public consultations. During construction and operation, steps will be taken to minimize \nenvironmental impacts. CEB has observed the route-selection criteria in the national regulations \nand has adopted best environmental practices. Adequate provisions have been made for the \nenvironmental mitigation measures, monitoring requirements, and their associated costs in the \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs) prepared for each subproject. CEB has sufficient \ncapacity to implement the safeguard measures incorporated in the EMPs. Mitigation measures \nrelated to construction and specified in the EMPs will be incorporated into civil works contracts. \nThe contractors will have primary responsibility for implementing the mitigation measures during \nconstruction,  but  CEB  will  be  responsible  for  and  periodically  report  to  ADB  on  overall \nimplementation of its site-specific EMPs. CEB and SEA will adhere to ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement (2009) and local and government environmental regulations. The project is classified \ncategory B for environment. \n \n3.  Climate Change Impact \n \n29.  The project is expected to have considerable positive impacts on climate change. Its \nrenewable energy intervention will bring solar power generation to the grid, which is equivalent \nto avoiding about 1,286 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. An average reduction of \nabout 55,500 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year may be achieved through technical loss \nreduction from the improved energy efficiency of the transmission and distribution lines for \n2016\u20132036. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n30.  The  potential  governance  risk  stems  from  CEB  having  insufficient  cash  to  fund  its \noperations because of (i) an increase in fuel oil costs and reliance on expensive thermal \nelectricity generation, (ii) delays in commissioning less costly generating capacity, and (iii) tariffs \nset below the cost of supply. The potential risks to project implementation include unexpected \n                                                 \n22  Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23   Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nincreases in the prices of commodities and raw materials, and delays in implementation that \nraise  project  costs.  These  risks  appear  to  be  moderate  and  may  be  mitigated  through \n(i) progress on energy sector reforms, and government efforts to increase supply capacity and \nreduce the cost of generation; and (ii) close supervision by the steering committee and ADB, \ntimely project implementation, and advance contracting. Major risks and mitigating measures \nare described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.24 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nInsufficient cash generation by CEB to fund its  Progress on energy sector reforms, including an \noperations  independent energy sector regulatory framework, \nrationalizing tariff structures, and internal structural \nreforms in CEB; and commissioning of low-cost \ngeneration, including from hydropower and other \nrenewable sources \nProcurement and project implementation delays   Close supervision by the government\u2019s steering \ncommittee and ADB, open and transparent \ncompetitive bidding, proactive project \nimplementation, and advance contracting \nUnexpected increases in the prices of commodities  Inclusion of physical and price contingencies in the \nand raw materials  project cost estimate and timely project \nimplementation \nADB = Asian Development Bank, CEB = Ceylon Electricity Board. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n31.  The  government  and  MOPE  have  assured  ADB  that  project  implementation  shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. The government, MOPE, CEB, and \nSEA have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the draft \nloan and project agreements. \n \n32.  Disbursement of the credit line for the solar rooftop power generation pilot will be subject \nto the following conditions: \n \n(i)  approval of the criteria for the selection of private sector solar power developers \nand participating financial institution(s) by the government and ADB; \n(ii)  selection of an eligible participating financial institution(s)25 satisfactory to ADB; \nand \n(iii)  execution of a subsidiary financing agreement (and delivery of legal opinion \nthereon)  between  SEA,  eligible  participating  financial  institution(s),  and  the \ngovernment in form and substance satisfactory to ADB. \n                                                 \n24 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  The participating financial institution(s) will not be implementing agencies. \n ", "10 \n \nVI.
