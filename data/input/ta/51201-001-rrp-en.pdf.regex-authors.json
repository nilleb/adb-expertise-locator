THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan of \nup to $50,000,000 to Linyi Kingfarm Cooperative Agricultural Services (Kingfarm OpCo) and a \nproposed equity investment of up to $30,000,000 in Kingfarm Agricultural Services (Kingfarm) for \nthe Environmentally Sustainable Agricultural Input Distribution Project in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC).   \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n \n1.  Project Identification \n \n2.  Persistent rural poverty. Agriculture has developed rapidly and contributed substantially \nto the PRC's overall economic development. However, the transition to modern agriculture has \nnot  kept  pace  with  the  country\u2019s  urbanization  and  industrialization.  Given  agriculture\u2019s \nfundamental contribution to poverty reduction and improved rural livelihoods, the Government of \nthe PRC continues to prioritize agriculture modernization, especially by encouraging stronger \nparticipation of private companies. \n \n3.  Food security concerns. PRC's arable land, which represents 10% of the world\u2019s total \narable land, supports nearly 20% of the world\u2019s population.1 Limitations in cultivated land and \nwater resources (the PRC has 7% of the world\u2019s potable water), the adverse effects of climate \nchange,  population  growth,  and  ecological  vulnerabilities  impede  food  security  and  food \nproduction (footnote 1). Agricultural production in the PRC requires the efficient use of agricultural \nresources, including agricultural input, to meet the country\u2019s food demand.  \n \n4.  Inefficient use of agricultural inputs. The PRC is the world\u2019s largest fertilizer consumer \nand producer, accounting for about one-third of total global production capacity. The PRC\u2019s \nfertilizer industry has been overusing simple fertilizers,2 which has reduced soil fertility and crop \nyields and caused environmental damage to farmland and water pollution, threatening public \nhealth and food production. In 2014, the PRC used 565 kilograms of fertilizer per hectare (ha) of \narable land - three times higher than the average consumption in other upper-middle income \neconomies.3 Food production should be intensified in an environmentally sustainable manner, \nand alternatives to simple fertilizers should be supported.  \n \n5.  Government priorities for agricultural inputs. The Government of the PRC is promoting \nthe use of compound fertilizers4 and organic fertilizers to improve efficiencies and increase crop \nyields. The increasing application of compound and specialty fertilizers,5 including enhanced \nefficiency fertilizers such as controlled-release and water-soluble fertilizers, could lower fertilizer \nconsumption because of their higher nutrient-use efficiency and reduce nutrient losses to the \nenvironment. However, the penetration rate of compound fertilizers in the PRC was only 35% of \n                                                \n1  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 2015. Agricultural Policy Monitoring and \nEvaluation 2015. Paris.  \n2  Simple fertilizers contribute single nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. \n3  World Bank. World Development Indicators. http://databank.worldbank.org/wdi (accessed 30 June 2017). \n4  Compound fertilizers combine nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in a single product. \n5  Specialty fertilizers are high-efficiency fertilizers with a tailored chemical composition and unique features, such as \nslow or controlled-released fertilizers and water-soluble fertilizers (to be used in drip irrigation systems). \n ", "2   \ntotal fertilizer use in 2015, lower than the global average of 50%.6 The government\u2019s determination \nto increase fertilizer efficiency is translated into an ambitious policy goal of slowing the growth of \nfertilizer consumption to zero by 2020.7 \n \n6.  Challenges facing PRC farmers. Farmers in the PRC lack technical skills, education, \nmarket information, sales channels, and access to finance. Emigration out of rural communities, \nencouraged by higher wages in urban communities, has left an older labor force in the rural PRC. \nFrom 1992 to 2012, the PRC\u2019s rural population declined by 150 million people. This situation has \ndeprived the sector of the modern, skilled workforce it needs for more complex and larger-scale \nfarming operations, including using modern machinery and equipment.8     \n \n7.  Emerging land consolidation. The lack of access to knowledge-intensive agriculture is \nattributed to the small size of farms in the PRC, which prevents farmers from reaching the critical \nmass required to invest in modern farming techniques. The average size of farms in the PRC is \nonly 0.6 ha, as opposed to an average of 30.0 ha in high-income countries and 1.5 ha in low- and \nmedium-income countries.9 To address this issue, the government is promoting farmland transfer, \nwhich allows the PRC\u2019s farmers to rent farmland from other farmers and encourages large-scale \nfarming in the country.10 Rural farmers are also increasingly turning to agricultural-production \noutsourcing services to overcome agricultural production constraints. An agricultural-production \noutsourcing service is a contract arrangement whereby a farm household pays service fees to an \nindividual or organization to complete production tasks such as plowing fields, sowing seeds, \ntransplanting seedlings, and harvesting. However, machine and equipment owners are normally \nindividuals or small-scale cooperatives that lack professional farming knowledge and have limited \ncapacity to provide technical support to farmers. The PRC\u2019s farmers and small-scale cooperatives \nstill need comprehensive technical assistance that combines efficient agricultural input products, \nfarming and irrigation equipment, and tailored services.  \n \n8.  Project  selection. The  project\u2019s sponsor  is  Kingenta  Ecological  Engineering Group \n(Kingenta), the largest compound and specialty fertilizer producer and supplier in the PRC. \nThrough this project, Kingenta established a new company Kingfarm to help it transform from \nbeing a leading fertilizer manufacturer to becoming an integrated solution provider to farmers. The \nproject team identified Kingfarm as a suitable candidate for Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nsupport because of (i) Kingenta\u2019s leading position in the PRC\u2019s compound and specialty fertilizers \nindustry, with advanced technical capability and satisfactory financial performance, (ii) Kingfarm\u2019s \ngrowth potential via its rollout of 300 one-stop shops for farmers through Kingenta\u2019s existing \nnetwork to provide quality agricultural input and services to about 3 million smallholder farmers in \nthe PRC, and (iii) Kingenta\u2019s actions following the government\u2019s policy to curb the excessive use \nof simple fertilizers and encourage the application of enhanced efficiency fertilizers, which will \nhelp in the environmentally sustainable transformation of agricultural development in the PRC. \n \n2.  Project Design \n \n9.  Kingfarm will (i) establish 300 crop production service (CPS) centers that will provide \ncompound and specialty fertilizers, seeds, and other agricultural inputs, and agricultural services \n                                                \n6  L.

Sponsor \n   \n10.  The sponsor. Headquartered in Linshu, Shandong province, Kingenta was established in \n1998 by Lianbu Wan, its current chair and chief executive officer. It is the PRC\u2019s largest compound \nand specialty fertilizer producer and distributor with a solid record of gaining market share (11%) \nin a fragmented industry, and the largest controlled-release fertilizer producer (50% market share) \nand nitro-compound fertilizer producer (30% market share) (footnote 6). It has about 10,000 staff, \nincluding 650 in research and development and 3,000 in marketing.  \n \n11.  Kingenta is publicly listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange with market capitalization of \nabout $3.4 billion at the end of June 2017.  \n \n12.  Integrity due diligence was conducted in accordance with ADB\u2019s Integrity Due Diligence \nGuidelines for Nonsovereign Operations. 12 Tax integrity due diligence was also conducted.13 No \nsignificant or potentially significant integrity risks were identified.14 \n   \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n13.  Impacts. The project aligns with the government\u2019s strategic orientations for agricultural \nmodernization and rural development, particularly the government\u2019s calls to (i) improve the quality \nand  competitiveness  of  the  PRC\u2019s  agricultural  products  through  high-quality  farmland  and \nprofessional farmers, (ii) increase the nutrient use efficiency of fertilizers from the current 33% to \n40% in 2020, and (iii) slow the growth in fertilizer consumption to zero by 2020.15  \n \n14.  Outcome. The project will improve the accessibility and affordability of high-efficiency and \nenvironmentally sustainable compound fertilizers and other quality agricultural inputs for about 3 \nmillion smallholder farmers in eight PRC provinces. The project also promotes modern and \nenvironmentally sound agricultural production with more efficient agricultural input and services \nin the PRC. The project will reduce the use of conventional nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers \nthrough climate-smart agriculture and precision-farming practices. Higher efficiency in nutrient \ndelivery will result in less fertilizer being applied, leading to improved productivity and reduced \nsoil contamination and pollution to waterways and the atmosphere. Performance indicators with \ntargets are in the design and monitoring framework (footnote 15). \n \n15.  Outputs. The outputs of the project will be: (i) CPS centers rolled out, and (ii) upgrade \nplants constructed. Indicators are in the design and monitoring framework (footnote 15).  \n \n \n                                                \n11 The eight provinces, ranked based on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, are Jiangsu, Shandong, Hubei, \nShaanxi, Hebei, Henan, Anhui, and Shanxi. The last five of these provinces have GDP per capita below the national \naverage. Hubei\u2019s GDP is just above the national average. International Monetary Fund. 2016.

Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations  \n \n16.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project aligns with ADB\u2019s \nMidterm Review of Strategy 2020, which emphasizes the need to contribute to food security and \nagricultural productivity and to promote food safety and quality standards.16 The project is also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2016\u20132020 for the PRC,17 which supports \n(i) modern  agriculture  through  high-efficiency  agricultural  input  and  mechanical  equipment; \n(ii) circular  agriculture  through  value  chains  to  reduce  resource  inputs  and  waste  outputs; \n(iii) knowledge sharing between the public and private sectors; and (iv) climate resilience through \nagricultural infrastructure, technology, and practices. Through this project, ADB will support the \nsustainable development of knowledge-intensive agriculture in the PRC through the application \nof science and technology and agriculture services that CPS centers would provide.  \n \n17.  Consistency with sector strategy and relevant ADB operations. The project aligns \nwith ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Agriculture and Natural Resources, which stresses that ADB\u2019s \nprivate sector agribusiness investments \u201chave the potential to benefit millions of smallholder \nfarmers directly and contribute to public goods, such as food security, food safety, and reduced \nsoil and water pollution.\u201d 18 The project will complement a proposed PRC sovereign project, which \naims to develop inclusive agricultural service systems through the application of information and \ncommunication technology along agriculture and food value chains. 19 \n \nD.  Project Cost and Financing Plan \n \n[redacted] \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Table 1 summarizes the implementation arrangements. \n \nTable 1: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory  Kingenta and Kingfarm are subject to the general laws and industry-specific rules and regulations in \nthe PRC, particularly the (i) Regulations on Safe Management of Hazardous Chemicals (2011), (ii) \nframework \nEnvironmental Protection Law (2015), and (iii) Food Safety Law (2009, amended in 2015). \nManagement  Most of Kingfarm\u2019s senior management team are from Kingenta and have substantial industry \nknowledge and experience.  \nOperations  The CPS centers will provide farmers agricultural input for high-value crops such as fruits and \nvegetables; and staple crops such as wheat, rice, and corn. They also offer farmers agricultural \narrangements \nservices across the entire crop cycle from seeding, planting, fertilizing, plant protection to harvesting. \nKingfarm will implement an advanced management information system and enterprise resource \nplanning system to monitor the operations, sales, cash flows, and inventory of the CPS centers. \nPerformance  At a minimum, Kingfarm will report quarterly on KPIs, including financial and operational KPIs; and \nannually on safeguard and development indicators (i.e., output and outcome targets).  \nmonitoring \nCPS = crop production service, Kingenta = Kingenta Ecological Engineering Group, Kingfarm = Kingfarm Agricultural \nServices, KPI = key performance indicator, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSources: Kingenta and Asian Development Bank.  \n                                                \n16 ADB. 2014.

Projected Financial and Economic Performance  \n \n[redacted] \n \nG.  Unique Features \n \n19.  The project is ADB\u2019s first nonsovereign assistance to an agricultural input and service \nprovider.  Kingfarm\u2019s  unique  business  model  in  the  PRC  will  ensure  reliable  supply  of \nenvironmentally sustainable, and efficient agricultural inputs and services to about 3 million \nsmallholder farmers in eight PRC provinces.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  The Assistance  \n \n20.  ADB will invest $30 million equity in Kingfarm and provide a $50 million general corporate \nfinance loan to Kingfarm OpCo. \n \nB.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n21.  ADB assistance will add value on three fronts: \n(i)  Long-term capital. ADB will provide long-term financing in the form of equity and \ndebt, which is not readily available from local capital market. Long-term financing \nis particularly important given the scale and \u201cgreenfield\u201d (new) nature of the project \nin a cyclical sector. ADB is in a unique position to offer such long-term financing \nbecause of its understanding of the agriculture sector, particularly in the PRC.   \n(ii)  Best safeguard practices. Kingenta recognizes ADB\u2019s added value in helping \nKingfarm develop and implement a robust and integrated environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS) and monitor the progress during implementation.  \n(iii)  Inclusive and innovative business model. ADB\u2019s investment will help Kingfarm \nestablish an innovative business model that can help millions of smallholder \nfarmers with quality agricultural inputs and professional farming services. ADB\u2019s \nparticipation will also help enhance the image of Kingfarm in preparation for a \nfuture IPO. In addition, ADB could facilitate replication of Kingfarm\u2019s innovative \nbusiness model in other countries of Asia and the Pacific.  \n \nC.  Risks \n[redacted] \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n22.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project is classified \ncategory B for environmental impacts and category C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeoples. The potential environmental and social impacts of the project have been identified and \neffective measures to avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are \nincorporated in the safeguard reports and plans. Potential risks and impacts during construction \nare generally site-specific, short-term, and can be effectively managed by good engineering, \nconstruction, and housekeeping practices based on construction environmental management \n ", "6   \nplans. No involuntary resettlement or indigenous people issues are envisaged for the project. The \nnew facilities (upgrade plants) will either be constructed within existing premises and facilities or \nin  adjoining  lands  belonging  to  industrial  parks  or  zones.  Subprojects  with  significant \nenvironmental or social impacts will not be supported by the proceeds of ADB\u2019s investment. The \ninstitutional  capacity  and  commitment  of  Kingenta  to  manage  the  project\u2019s  social  and \nenvironmental impacts are deemed adequate. \n \n23.  A corporate audit was undertaken by an external third party in accordance with the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. The corporate audit assessed that the operations of the company \ncomplied with statutory requirements. The company\u2019s current environmental and social systems, \nprocesses, and practices were also deemed commensurate with the risks and impacts associated \nwith  its  business  and  operations.  The  audit  findings  and  recommendations  have  been \ndocumented and agreed in a corrective action plan for the project. In line with the corrective action \nplan\u2019s requirements, the company will strengthen and implement an ESMS satisfactory to ADB\u2019s \nrequirements. 20 The company will also report to ADB annually on ongoing compliance with the \nESMS and the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n24.  Kingfarm will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \nstandards.21 The borrower will report regularly to ADB on its compliance with such laws and the \nmeasures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will be conducted \nin accordance with ADB requirements.22   \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy  \n25.  Kingenta and Kingfarm were advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international \npractice relating to combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB \nwill ensure that the investment documentation includes provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism; and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance.  \n \nC.  Investment Limitations  \n \n26.  The proposed loan and equity investment are within the medium-term, country, industry, \ngroup, and single-project exposure limits for nonsovereign investments. \n \nD.  Assurances \n \n27.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter),23 \nADB will proceed with the proposed assistance upon establishing that the Government of the \n                                                \n20 The corporate audit suggested that while the company had corporate and plant-level policies and procedures for the \nenvironment, health, and safety, human resources, and social and corporate social responsibility, there was a need \nto (i) review and strengthen the occupational health and safety management procedures and develop a plan to \nimprove safety practices and provide safe and healthy working conditions for workers, including contract workers, \n(ii) ensure that Kingfarm will adhere to IFC\u2019s Environment, Health, and Safety Guidelines, including those for \nperennial and annual crop production, and (iii) develop integrated pest or vector management plans to assist farmers \nin reducing their reliance on synthetic chemical pesticides. It also identified the need to integrate environmental and \nsocial sensitivities early in the project decision-making processes, and strengthen the environmental and social due \ndiligence processes by integrating requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement. \n21 ADB. 2003.
