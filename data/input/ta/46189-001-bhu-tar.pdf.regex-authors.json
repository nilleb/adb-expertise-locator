INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) responds to a request by the Government of Bhutan to the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  additional  support  to  strengthen  the  development \nmanagement capacity of the Ministry of Finance (MOF), and the government in general. The TA \nis  included  in  the  country  operations  business  plan,  2013\u20132015  for  Bhutan.1 Consultation \nmissions were fielded, and the government and ADB reached an agreement on the impact, \noutcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost  and  financing  plan,  and  terms  of \nreference for consultants of the TA. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  economy  has  performed  well  in  FY2001\u2013FY2011  by  achieving  an  average \neconomic growth rate of about 8%; this was higher than for any other South Asian economy. \nWhile growth is estimated to have moderated slightly to 8.3% in FY2011 from 9.3% in FY2010, \nit is forecast at 7.9% for FY2012 and 8.4% for FY2013 largely because of continued hydropower \nconstruction.3 In response to the high and sustained growth, Bhutan has been successful in \nreducing poverty. Based on the national poverty line, the incidence of poverty declined from \nabout 32% in 2003 to about 23% in 2007. \n \n3.  Sustaining high economic growth remains a major challenge. Economic growth is largely \nfinanced by external aid. The fiscal deficit has been deteriorating; in FY2011 it was 4.7% of \ngross domestic product (GDP) because of rising capital expenditures reflecting hydropower \nconstruction and the increase of public servants pay in January 2011. The current account \ndeficit has also been widening and is projected to be 20% of GDP in FY2012 and 24% in \nFY2013 (footnote 3). Bhutan\u2019s external position with India has weakened greatly as power sales \nhave reached generation capacity and import demand has accelerated because of the power \nconstruction programs and strong domestic economic growth. At the end of FY2011, Bhutan\u2019s \nIndian rupee reserves amounted to about 1 week of imports, although convertible currency \nreserves were high at nearly $890 million, equivalent to about 9 months of total (essential and \nnonessential) imports.4 \n \n4.  Recognizing  these  emerging  challenges,  the  government  through  its  Economic \nDevelopment  Policy,  2010  aims to  achieve  economic  self-reliance  by  2020.5 MOF,  as the \nprovider of stewardship for policy implementation, requires capacity building. For MOF to take \non a stronger stewardship role in a dynamic macroeconomic context, it needs to adopt best \npractices pertaining to, among other things, fiscal policy and medium-term fiscal framework, \nbudgeting and public expenditure management, taxation reforms and revenue forecasting, debt \nsustainability analysis, and government property management and public procurement reforms. \nADB has a number of ongoing and forthcoming TA projects in Bhutan that aim to enhance \nMOF\u2019s public financial management capacity.6 The proposed TA complements these efforts by \n                                                \n1  ADB.  2012.  Country  Operations  Business  Plan:  Bhutan,  2013\u20132015.  Manila.  Under  the  country  operations \nbusiness plan 2013\u20132015, the total cost of the TA (formerly entitled Strengthening Government Services Delivery) \nwas $475,000. Additional funding from the Second Danish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance was \nsubsequently sought, and the total TA cost was revised to $725,000. Given the increased funding and resulting \nmodification of the TA scope, the TA title was changed from Strengthening Government Services Delivery. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 October 2012.  \n3  ADB. 2012.

Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan \nfor Strengthening Public Management. Manila; (ii) ADB. 2011. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Bhutan for \n ", "2   \nfocusing  on,  among  other  things,  enhancing  the  understanding  of  macroeconomic  issues \namong  MOF  staff,  strengthening  MOF\u2019s  capacity  in  macroeconomic  management,  and \nproviding timely policy advice to address emerging issues faced by MOF. \n \n5.  As the nodal agency for ADB-funded projects, MOF plays a critical role in ensuring \nefficient programming as well as providing oversight of effective portfolio management. The \n2010  country  assistance  program  evaluation  rated  ADB  operations  in  Bhutan  successful. 7 \nBhutan achieved a 100% success rate for completed projects based on project completion \nreports issued in 2000\u20132011.8 Nevertheless, the evaluation highlighted that implementation \nefficiency,  although  still  above  the  ADB  average,  had  been  declining,  possibly  due  to the \nincreasing size of projects and complexity of project design, frequent project design changes, \nand  increasing  work  volume  coupled  with  limited  capacity  of  local  contractors.  Given  the \nexpected  increase  of  ADB  operations  in  Bhutan,  MOF\u2019s  stewardship  role  will  need  to  be \nstrengthened to enhance implementation efficiency and improve the development effectiveness \nof ADB support. \n \n6.  To  enhance  development  effectiveness, government  interventions  and  ADB  support \nmust be more evidence-based. Data from the Third Bhutan Living Standards Survey, 2012 \nunder ongoing ADB TA, will be particularly useful in updating the country\u2019s assessment of \npoverty and other development outcomes. 9 While Bhutan has made remarkable progress in \nreducing poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals, pockets of poverty remain \nand  inequality  is  persistently  high.  These  observations  underline  the  need  for  inclusive \neconomic growth and development effectiveness. Rigorous analytical work will contribute to \nidentifying development needs and formulating remedial actions to address them to sustain a \nhigh and inclusive growth trajectory.     \n \n7.  The 2012 survey data together with data from the Second Bhutan Living Standards \nSurvey, 2007 support evaluation of key achievements of the government\u2019s Tenth Five Year \nPlan, 2008\u20132013 and the development impact of some of ADB\u2019s key projects implemented in \nBhutan. The socioeconomic assessment and impact evaluation studies under the TA will be \nhighly relevant and useful for guiding the design of future interventions by the government, ADB, \nand development partners; and enhancing their continuous efforts to reduce poverty. \n \n8.  While ADB support for undertaking such assessments will be useful, ADB must support \nthe government\u2019s analytical capacity to formulate more evidence-based policies. Bhutan 2020: \nA Vision for Peace, Prosperity and Happiness highlights the need to strengthen government \ncapacity to monitor and evaluate the development process and to undertake policy research on \ndevelopment issues;10 the proposed TA aims to support the identified needs. In addition, the \ngovernment is elaborating a new economic paradigm based on well-being and happiness.11 The \nTA contributes to the new paradigm by responding to the government\u2019s request for ADB support. \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nDeveloping a Revenue Administration Management Information System (Financed by the Republic of Korea e-Asia \nand Knowledge Partnership Fund).

The TA impact will be improved socioeconomic management of the government for \nsustaining a high and inclusive growth trajectory. The outcome will be improved MOF and \ngovernment capacity in development management.12 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  To achieve the envisaged impact and outcome, the TA comprises two major outputs: \nstrengthened analytical skills for macroeconomic management and project implementation, and \nenhanced knowledge of socioeconomic assessment and impact evaluation studies. \n \n11.  Strengthened  analytical  skills  for  macroeconomic  management  and  project \nimplementation.  Under  this  output,  in-country  training  seminars  and/or  workshops  will  be \norganized for MOF staff to enhance their economic management capacity. In-country training \nworkshops on project implementation-related issues (including procurement, disbursement, and \nsafeguards)  will  be  organized  for  officials from  MOF  and  other key  government  ministries \nimplementing ADB-funded projects. To serve as training reference material, a compendium of \nguidelines on project implementation will be prepared and provided to the MOF and other \ngovernment staff. In addition, at least one field trip will be conducted for the exchange of best \npractices and knowledge sharing with other developing member countries. The details of the \ntopics to be taken up during the capacity-building activities will be identified and developed \nthrough coordination with MOF during TA implementation. The key criteria for the topic selection \ninclude the importance and urgency of the issues and challenges that could undermine MOF\u2019s \nability to undertake economic management and project implementation. Policy advice will be \nprovided when and as requested by MOF to address emerging issues in a timely manner. The \npolicy advice provided under this output will be published as an analytical report and/or policy \nbriefs for wider dissemination.   \n \n12.  Enhanced  knowledge  of  socioeconomic  assessment  and  impact  evaluation \nstudies. The output will generate knowledge products, including (i) socioeconomic assessment \nand impact evaluation studies using data from the Third Bhutan Living Standards Survey,13 and \n(ii) analytical work supporting the government\u2019s new economic paradigm. The socioeconomic \nassessment and impact evaluation studies are intended to assist the government and other key \nstakeholders  in  fine-tuning  policies  and  operations  for  better  development  management. \nMeanwhile,  the  analytical  work  for  the  government\u2019s  new  economic  paradigm  will  directly \ncontribute  to  the  body  of  knowledge  being  established  for  this  new  thrust,  supporting  the \ngovernment\u2019s  recent  initiatives  (footnote  11).  Inception  and  consultation  workshops  will  be \norganized for key stakeholders (including government ministries and agencies, development \npartners, and civil society) to ensure that the consultative approach is used for the conduct of \nthe studies. Following the inception workshop, the topics to be covered will be decided by a \nproject steering committee in coordination with the ADB TA team (para. 15). Study reports and \npolicy briefs will be produced. Under this output, in-country training will be organized to enhance \n                                                \n12 Development management in the TA refers to the coordination and management processes of development \nprograms and projects, and the management of economic development of a country. \n13 The Third Bhutan Living Standard Survey was designed such that the impact evaluation of ADB-funded projects \ncan be undertaken. The possibility of undertaking impact evaluation of other projects will be explored if the data \npermits. \n ", "4   \nthe analytical capacity of officials from key government ministries and agencies to formulate \nmore evidence-based policies.  \n \n13.  The main assumptions considered in the TA include (i) the external environment remains \nstable without any major shocks, (ii) the government uses analytical publications for policy \nformulation,  (iii)  officials  from  key  government  ministries  and  agencies  participate  in  TA \nactivities, and (iv) required data and information are readily accessible. The main risk is that the \ngovernment could be unable to retain trained officials in public service. ADB\u2019s communities of \npractice, with their wide networks of experts on specific fields, will be consulted to ensure that \nqualified consultants are engaged for TA activities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $735,000.00, of which (i) $475,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV); and (ii) $250,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Second Danish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance \nand administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office \nspace and facilities, counterpart staff, office supplies, domestic transportation, administrative \nand clerical support, and other in-kind contributions. The value of the government contribution is \nestimated to account for 1.4% of the total TA cost. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan is in Appendix 2. ADB\u2019s TASF-IV and the Second Danish Cooperation Fund for Technical \nAssistance will jointly finance disbursements under the TA. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  MOF will be the executing agency. MOF\u2019s Department of Public Accounts (DPA) will be \nthe implementing agency. The director of DPA will oversee TA implementation. ADB\u2019s South \nAsia Regional Cooperation and Operations Coordination Division will be responsible for overall \nsupervision of the TA. A focal person, to be nominated from DPA, will  work with the TA \nconsultants to facilitate timely and effective TA implementation. A steering committee will be \nestablished to ensure efficient and effective TA implementation. The DPA director will chair the \ncommittee, which will comprise senior officials from key government ministries and agencies, \nincluding the Gross National Happiness Commission and the National Statistics Bureau. The \ncommittee will meet every 4 months; representatives from the ADB TA team are to join the \nmeetings onsite or through videoconference and/or teleconference, where possible.  \n \n16.  The TA will require an estimated 29 person-months of consulting services (21 person-\nmonths international and 8 person-months national). The actual requirements of each type of \nexpertise and the length of their inputs will be identified during the implementation of individual \nstudies. Given this limitation, the intermittent nature of assignments, and anticipated variety of \nexpertise required, the TA will primarily meet its consulting requirements by recruiting experts \non an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All procurement will be carried \nout in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented from November 2012 to November 2014. Implementation \nprogress will be monitored through ADB\u2019s TA review missions and regular consultations with the \nconcerned  agencies  to  ensure  effective  implementation  as  well  as  early  identification  and ", "  5 \nresolution of emerging issues or delays. ADB will prepare the TA completion report to assess \noverall TA performance given the targeted pipeline of outputs. \n \n18.  Knowledge  products  generated  by  the  TA  will  be  disseminated  widely  through \nworkshops and seminars, and ADB and government websites. Good practices and lessons from \nthe  TA  will  be  shared  through  the  South  Asia  seminar  series  and  other  ADB  forums  as \nappropriate. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Second Danish Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance, \nand (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $475,000 on a grant basis, to \nthe  Government  of  Bhutan  for  Enhancing  Development  Management  for  Sustainable  and \nInclusive Growth, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved  By 2018, a coherent  Relevant government  The external \nsocioeconomic  national development plan  and central bank  environment remains \nmanagement of the  and investment program  announcements and  stable without any \ngovernment for  formulated by the  reports  major economic \nsustaining a high and  government (2012    shocks. \ninclusive growth  baseline: the next 5-year  Gross National   \ntrajectory  plan is currently being  Happiness \nformulated)  Commission\u2019s 11th Five \n  Year Plan \n   \nBy 2018, at least one  Relevant government \npolicy measure resulting  and central bank \nfrom TA policy advice  announcements, reports, \napproved by the  and data \ngovernment to address the   \nIndian rupee liquidity issue  ADB\u2019s Asian \nand other key emerging  Development Outlook, \nissues   IMF Article IV, and \n  Economic Intelligence \nUnit reports \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved MOF and  The country performance  ADB country  The government uses \ngovernment capacity  assessment score of 3.5  performance  analytical publications \nin development  for portfolio performance of  assessments  for their policy \nmanagement  ADB operations in Bhutan    formulation. \n  maintained from 2013  Development   \nonwards (2012 baseline:  effectiveness report  Risks \nportfolio score of 3.5)  ADB portfolio review  Trained officials are not \n  missions  retained in the \n    government. \nThe percentage of projects  ADB operations   \nat risk maintained at 10%  dashboard \nor below of the total   \nongoing ADB projects in   \nBhutan from 2013 onwards   \n(2011 baseline: 9%)   \n   \n70% of issues raised by  MOF\u2019s national budget \nand policy  report \nrecommendations under   \nthe TA reflected in MOF\u2019s  MOF\u2019s annual financial \nnational budget report  statements \nand/or annual financial   \nstatements and/or RMA\u2019s  RMA\u2019s annual report \nannual report and  RMA\u2019s monetary \nmonetary statements   statements \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
