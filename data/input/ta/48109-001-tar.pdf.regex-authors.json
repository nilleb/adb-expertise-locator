INTRODUCTION \n1.  All  investment  projects  proposed  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  financing  are \nrequired  to  conduct  environmental  assessments\u2014including  environmental  analysis  and \nplanning to manage the environmental impacts and risks associated with a project\u2014at an early \nstage of project preparation. Depending on the significance of project impacts and risks, the \nassessment  may  comprise  a  full-scale  environmental  impact  assessment  for  category  A \nprojects,  and  initial  environmental  examination  for  category  B  projects.  An  environmental \nmanagement plan (EMP) prepared as part of the environmental assessment document presents \nthe  framework  for  implementing  the  mitigation  measures  for  the  impacts  identified  in  the \nenvironmental  assessment  study.  The  EMP  also  includes  environmental  monitoring  and \nreporting requirements, emergency response procedures, related institutional or organizational \narrangements, capacity development and training measures, implementation schedule, cost \nestimates, and performance indicators.  \n \n2.  During project implementation, the executing agencies oversee the application of the \nEMP. They are encouraged to prepare a site-specific EMP (SSEMP) as international best \npractice to monitor the progress of implementation of the environmental mitigation measures \nspecific  to  the  site  conditions.  The  executing  agencies  are  also  responsible  for  preparing \nperiodic environmental monitoring reports (EMRs) that describe progress with implementation of \nthe EMP or SSEMP, compliance issues, and corrective actions, if any. The executing agencies \nare required to submit at least semiannual EMRs during construction for projects likely to have \nsignificant adverse environmental impacts, or quarterly EMRs for highly complex and sensitive \nprojects. Such periodic reports are posted in a location accessible to the public in addition to \nbeing disclosed on the ADB website.  \n \n3.  For ADB-financed projects in developing member countries (DMCs) of Central and West \nAsia  (CWA),  the  executing  agencies  have  requested  ADB  to  provide  environmental \nmanagement  capacity  building  to  the  project  management  units.  This  would  enable  the \nexecuting agencies\u2019 project environment specialists to effectively monitor preparation of the \nSSEMP and progress of EMP and SSEMP implementation, assess the compliance status, \nrecommend corrective actions as needed, and prepare EMRs  of internationally acceptable \nquality on time. This regional technical assistance (TA) will support building the capacity of the \nexecuting agencies for environmental safeguard implementation and help sustain the acquired \nenvironmental  management  capacity  across  the  region. 1 For  each  country,  government \nconcurrence with its participation in the TA will be obtained before TA commencement. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Currently, 126 projects are under implementation across all sectors in 10 CWA DMCs; \nmost  projects  involve  large-scale  construction  and  are  classified  as  category  A  (16%)  or \ncategory B (68%) for environment. Over the past few years, the quality of environmental impact \nassessments, initial environmental examinations, and EMPs as well as timeliness of submission \nand disclosure of these safeguard documents have improved. However, there is room for further \nimprovement particularly as regards implementing the EMPs and preparing and operationalizing \nthe  SSEMPs.  The  capacity  of  the  executing  agencies\u2019  environment  specialists  needs \n                                                \n1  The ADB vice-president, Operations 1 approved the TA concept paper on 9 April 2014. The TA first appeared in \nthe business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 April 2014. As a regional TA it was not included in the \ncountry operations business plans of the individual DMCs covered by the Central and West Asia Department \n(CWRD).   \n ", "2   \nstrengthening,  including  monitoring  the  preparation  and  field  implementation  of  EMPs  and \nSSEMPs. Also, further capacity needs to be built to respond to scenarios not presented in the \nEMPs. Such scenarios could otherwise potentially result in noncompliance with the Safeguard \nPolicy Statement, and thus could become a bottleneck to the overall implementation of the \nproject. \n \n5.  In  2010,  CWRD  launched  a  Regional  TA  for  Improving  the  Implementation  of \nEnvironmental  Safeguards  in  Central  and  West  Asia  (2010  TA)  to  provide  training  in \nenvironmental risk assessment and in the preparation and implementation of SSEMPs across \nall  10  DMCs  of  the  region.2 The  TA  was  designed  to  provide  continuous  environmental \nmanagement support to the executing agencies of all projects under implementation across \nthese 10 DMCs. Comprehensive training materials were produced to build the capacity of \nexecuting agencies and project staff in these areas.  \n \n6.  The 2010 TA required that one national environmental firm be hired in each DMC, \nthrough an indefinite delivery contract, to conduct environmental auditing and environmental \nmanagement training of executing agencies on a continuous or as needed basis, throughout the \nlife of the TA. However, this approach could not be fully realized as national environmental firms \ndid not exist in each of the DMCs.3 As a result, contrary to original design, firms had to be hired \ninternationally, with one firm covering more than one country, which had logistical and cost \nimplications.  Furthermore,  the  staff  of  the  national  firm  was  required  to  fulfill  international \nexperience  requirements  so  as  to  be  able  to  work  across  borders,  which  also  became  a \nconstraint. Therefore, the model of continued training could not be implemented as designed. \nHowever, comprehensive materials for training were developed, which will also be used in this \nTA. A first round of auditing and training has been under way since 2013 and is expected to \nfinish by mid-2014. Training of executing agencies will continue to be required. This will also \nhelp  reducing  the  reliance  on  project  supervision  consultants\u2019  international  environment \nspecialists (often recruited only on intermittent basis) and instead focuses on directly enhancing \nthe  executing  agencies\u2019  environmental  management  capacity,  or  that  of  their  individual \nenvironment specialists. Development of an environmental monitoring solution, implemented \nthrough DMC-based national environmental safeguards consultants, will build in-house national \nexpertise in environmental management at the level of the executing agencies, and will result in \nstronger capacity of the executing agencies for implementing EMPs and SSEMPs across future \nprojects in the participating DMCs of the CWA region.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be sustained environmental compliance across all ADB-financed projects \nin participating DMCs across CWA region. The outcome will be improved implementation of \nSSEMPs for category A and B projects in participating DMCs across the CWA region.  \n \n                                                \n2   ADB. 2010.  Technical Assistance for Improving the Implementation of Environmental Safeguards in Central and \nWest Asia. Manila (TA 7548-REG, $800,000, approved on 21 June, with a revised completion date of 31 \nDecember 2014, and additional funding of $750,000 approved on 12 August 2013).  \n3  From the 10 DMCs, expressions of interest were submitted to ADB by only six firms. From these, at the bidding \nstage only four were found to be eligible, and were selected to cover the CWA region.  \n ", "  3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) project environmental monitoring solution (PEMS) \ndeveloped;  (ii)  environmental  management  capacity  of  executing  agencies  enhanced;  and \n(iii) executing agency performance on environmental management showcased. \n \n9.  Output 1 will be delivered through development and implementation of a continuous \nPEMS. The PEMS will serve as a monitoring, feedback, and training loop that will result in a \nsolution customized to meet the needs and specific capacity gaps of each executing agency. \nThe international environmental safeguards consultant will conduct a sector-focused capacity \ngap analysis. The international environmental safeguards consultant will develop a five-point \nranking  system  on  safeguards  compliance,  which  will  provide  detailed  criteria  for  ranking \nenvironmental compliance of ongoing projects. This ranking system will be used to accurately \nmeasure biannually the level and quality of environmental compliance in each ongoing project. \nAfter consultations with the directors and environment specialists of the executing agencies\u2019 \nproject management units, and ADB\u2019s project team leaders in the sector divisions, a framework \nfor the PEMS will be developed by incorporating any concerns over implementation issues. The \nPEMS framework will be finalized and then implemented in the field by national environmental \nsafeguards consultants placed at ADB\u2019s resident mission in each participating DMC. \n \n10.  Output 2 will be achieved by developing and implementing the capacity enhancement \nplan. The quality of environmental management and compliance in ongoing projects is expected \nto  increase  with  the  implementation  of  the  PEMS  framework.  The  national  environmental \nsafeguards consultant placed at each resident mission will closely interact with each executing \nagency\u2019s project management unit, identifying executing agency- or sector-specific issues and \ncustomizing  the  PEMS  for  each  executing  agency. The  national  environmental  safeguards \nconsultant  will  achieve  this through  continuous  involvement  and  close  cooperation  with  all \nexecuting agencies and ADB project team leaders, and by conducting regular site visits. The \nnational  environmental  safeguards  consultant  will  first  assess  the  capacity  gaps  and  then \ndevelop  and  operationalize  targeted  and  sustainable  executing  agency-specific  capacity \nenhancement plans. Additional gaps found by the national environmental safeguards consultant \nwill be bridged through the continuous monitoring, feedback, and training loop. Each national \nenvironmental safeguards consultant will have the annual target of improving the compliance of \ntheir  projects  by  one  ranking  point,  thereby  ensuring  improvement  in  environmental \nmanagement at the executing agencies. \n \n11.  Output 3 will showcase the improvement in environmental management performance by \nthe  executing  agencies.  The  national  environmental  safeguards  consultant  at  the  resident \nmission will liaise with government environmental institutions and agencies and nongovernment \nagencies in each participating DMC to establish a national environment network. This national \nenvironment network will promote better understanding of the implementation of environmental \nsafeguards in the field, and will assist in developing mechanisms to overcome the challenges at \nvarious stages of implementation. The national environmental safeguards consultant will also \nprepare  knowledge  products  to  showcase  the  successes  of  executing  agencies  and  their \nimproved  ranking  in  environmental  management;  these  will  be  instrumental  in  improving \nenvironmental management capacity across all executing agencies in the participating DMCs. \n \n12.  Frequently conducted, project-focused environmental management and risk assessment \ntraining for each executing agency across the participating DMCs will increase national self-\nreliance in these areas. The TA through its continuous monitoring, feedback and training loop \nwill address the prevailing situation of frequent turnover of executing agency environment staff \n ", "4   \nby training all new staff. As a result, the TA will train a greater number of environmental \nprofessionals, thus moving toward sustainable environmental management.     \n \n13.  The key assumption to the success of the TA is that the executing agency environmental \nstaff trained through the PEMS will be retained. In the event that staff turnover does occur, the \nnature of the capacity enhancement program is such that training will be repeated regularly, and \nwill  resemble  the  model  of  continuous  on-the-job  training  to  counter  the  impacts  of  staff \nturnover. The risk that the TA faces is that the prolonged decision-making process of executing \nagencies may cause delays in endorsing the ranking criteria, which could lead to long delays in \nactually implementing the PEMS. This risk will be managed by the active involvement and \nfollow-up of the international environment consultant in keeping the process directed and well-\npaced.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The detailed cost estimates \nand financing plan are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 38 months from July 2014 to December 2017. All CWA \nDMCs are eligible to benefit from the TA. Due to limited funding resources, the DMCs with \nlarger portfolio size and greater number of ongoing environmental category A and B projects will \nbe  prioritized  to  maximize  the  country-specific  scale  of  benefits.4 Timeliness  of  DMCs\u2019 \nconcurrence to participate in the TA and readiness to hire a national environment consultant will \nalso be considered to minimize project start-up delays. Appropriate adjustments will be made as \nneeded. \n \n16.  ADB, through CWRD\u2019s Portfolio, Results, Safeguards and Social Sector Unit (CWOD-\nPSS) in collaboration with CWRD\u2019s sector divisions and resident missions concerned, will be the \nTA executing agency. CWOD-PSS will be responsible for overall management and coordination \nof the TA. The total consultant input for the TA is anticipated to be 219 person-months. The TA \nwill utilize the services of: one international environmental safeguards consultant (headquarters-\nbased, 18 person-months, intermittent) to prepare the ranking criteria and project environmental \nmonitoring  solution,  and  manage  the  knowledge  product  preparation  process  across  all \nparticipating DMCs; five national environmental safeguards consultants (180 person-months, full \ntime), one in each participating DMC to implement the capacity-building program by delivering \nthe  training,  customizing  it  for  each  executing  agency,  and  reviewing  the  progress  of \nenvironmental management on site for each ongoing project in the participating DMCs; while \none national TA support consultant (headquarters-based, 21 person-months, intermittent) will be \nhired to provide support to the TA implementation. All consultants will be engaged individually \nby ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from \ntime to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants is provided in Appendix 3.  \n                                                \n4  The top five CWA DMCs in terms of portfolio size are Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, and \nAzerbaijan, while the top five CWA DMCs in terms of number of projects are Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, \nTajikistan, and the Kyrgyz Republic. For TA budgeting purposes, the top five CWA DMCs in terms of number of \nprojects are being considered. The final participating DMCs will be confirmed at the inception stage, and may be \nfurther adjusted as needed during project implementation. Based on implementation progress, additional financing \nwill be considered to meet the future needs for environmental capacity enhancement of the remaining DMCs in the \nregion. \n ", "  5 \n      \n17.  The CWOD-PSS senior environment specialist will carry out TA coordination, assisted \nby  the  national  TA  support  consultant  and  the  international  environmental  safeguards \nconsultant. This includes coordinating all activities with the participating DMCs and the national \nenvironmental safeguards consultants. The international environmental safeguards consultant \nwill assist in obtaining government concurrence with the TA and oversee the technical outputs \nof  the  national  environmental  safeguards  consultants.  The  international  environmental \nsafeguards consultant will develop the ranking criteria against which the national environmental \nsafeguards consultants will measure the quality of environmental compliance of each ongoing \nenvironment category A and B project. The national environmental safeguards consultants will \nimplement the PEMS through regularly visiting the project sites and monitoring progress thereby \nenhancing  the  capacity  of  the  executing  agencies  in  environmental  management.  All \ndisbursements will be made in accordance with the guidelines provided in ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). No TA activity will \ncommence in any participating DMC until the DMC provides a no-objection letter. \n \n18.  The CWOD-PSS senior environment specialist will monitor TA progress by reviewing the \nquality and timeliness of the outputs, and, if required, will be provide feedback to improve quality \nof the outputs. Workshops will be held for information dissemination and consensus building. \nThe executing agencies will submit project-specific EMRs monthly to the national environmental \nsafeguards consultants; biannual submissions will be made for disclosure to the ADB  and \nexecuting agencies\u2019 websites as required by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). Good \npractices will be recorded and disseminated as case studies and shared through workshops. A \nfull accomplishment assessment will be undertaken at TA completion to report on sustainable \nenvironmental management of projects in the CWA region. \n \n19.  The knowledge products, prepared by the national environment consultant to showcase \nthe environmental performance of the executing agencies and their environment teams, will be \ndisseminated through the CWRD website and shared at the departmental level by CWOD-PSS \nthrough its regular safeguards outreach program.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Sustainable Environmental Management of Projects in Central and West Asia, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and \nDesign Summary  Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nSustained  By 2020  Project performance  Full ownership by all \nenvironmental  Delays in project  report  participating DMCs \ncompliance across  implementation in     \nall ADB-financed  participating DMCs (due  ADB\u2019s country  Risk \nprojects in  to environmental issues  safeguards review  Political priorities may \nparticipating DMCs  on site) prevented   reports  change.  \nacross CWA region      \n   ADB\u2019s country portfolio \n  review reports \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved  By 2017  National environmental  Executing agencies\u2019 \nImplementation of  100% disclosure of EMRs  safeguard consultants\u2019   leaders remain fully \nSSEMPs for  (2013 baseline: EMR  biannual TA reports  committed to improving \ncategory A and B  disclosure rate 76%)     the quality of \nprojects in    ADB website  environmental \nparticipating DMCs  80% of EMRs received  (disclosure)  management. \nacross CWA region  are ready for immediate     \n  disclosure  Chief compliance  Risk \n  (2013 baseline: 50% of  officer\u2019s annual review  Change in leadership at \nEMRs received are of a  report of SPS  the participating \nquality fit for disclosure)  compliance  executing agencies \n \nOutputs       \n1.
