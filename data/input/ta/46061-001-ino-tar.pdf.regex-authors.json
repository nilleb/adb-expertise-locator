", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Based  on  the  growth  and  increasing  importance  of  Islamic  finance  in  the  member \ncountries of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and potential implications for financial stability, \na number of central banks in Asia are implementing prudential standards in Islamic finance to \naddress new risks. Through their respective central banks, the governments of Afghanistan, \nBangladesh,  Indonesia,  and  Pakistan  have  asked  ADB  for  assistance  in  implementing \nprudential  standards  developed  by  the  Islamic  Financial  Services  Board  (IFSB)1 and  have \nindicated interest in getting assistance in further developing their Islamic finance sectors. The \nGovernment of Malaysia, through Bank Negara Malaysia, has indicated interest in working with \nADB in implementing such standards to help regional peers. In addition, the governments of \nBrunei Darussalam, and the Maldives have informed the IFSB that they plan to implement some \nselected standards.2 In June 2012, a fact-finding mission visited Malaysia and reached an \nunderstanding with the IFSB on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference of the technical assistance (TA), Implementing Prudential \nStandards in Islamic Finance.3 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Although the Islamic financial services industry is still small compared to conventional \nfinance, annual growth averaging around 20% since 2000 underlines its increasing significance. \nThe top 500 Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) recorded total sharia (Islamic law)-compliant \nassets of $639 billion by the end of 2008, growth of 27.6% compared to 2007; this figure rose \nby another 28.6% to $822 billion in 2009. This growth continued even through the global \nfinancial crisis, reports estimate that Islamic banking assets globally will reach $1.1 trillion in \n2012. 5  The  resilience  during  the  crisis  resulted  in  greater  appreciation  of  the  unique \ncharacteristics of Islamic finance, including principles such as materiality of transactions and \nmutuality of risk sharing which contribute to soundness, stability, and inclusiveness of financial \nsystem architectures. The high growth rate has applied across all asset classes, including \nIslamic banking, takaful (Islamic insurance) asset management, and sukuk (Islamic financial \ncertificate). In 2009, global takaful contribution increased by 31% to $6.9 billion. This total \nincreased to $8.33 billion in 2010 and went up higher to approximately $10 billion in 2011. With \nthe emergence of new fringe markets such Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, and Indonesia, \nthe forecast is that the takaful industry will be a $12 billion industry by end of 2012.6 In \nsummary, Islamic finance is now either too large to ignore, and in a number of ADB\u2019s member \ncountries, is approaching systemic importance. \n \n3.  In addition to this fast-paced growth, the potential for Islamic finance to improve access \nto finance for a segment of lower-income people should not be underestimated. This applies to \nboth savings accounts and investment instruments. Studies have shown that a segment of the \nMuslim  population  abstains  from  conventional  savings  accounts  because  of  the  interest-\ngenerating features of these accounts, which is prohibited in sharia; the preference is for the \n                                                \n1 The IFSB is an international standard-setting body of regulatory and supervisory agencies that have a vested \ninterest in ensuring the soundness and stability of the Islamic financial services industry. It is based in Kuala \nLumpur, Malaysia. \n2 The IFSB conducted a standards implementation survey in 2011. \n3 Through their respective central banks, the governments of Afghanistan, Indonesia, and Pakistan have confirmed \ntheir interest and request for assistance through email communication to ADB. \n4 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 July 2012. \n5 Ernst & Young. 2011. World Islamic Banking Competitiveness Report. \n6 Ernst & Young. 2012. World Takaful Report. ", "2 \nprofit-sharing structure based on mudharabah (profit-sharing) contract offered by IFIs.7 Similarly, \nsome people abstain from conventional investment instruments as they prefer investments that \nare compliant with sharia. Therefore, Islamic finance provides access to the \u2015unbanked,\u2016 and \npromotes financial stability through development of an alternative asset class. This helps to \ndiversify  the  finance  sector  in  ADB\u2019s  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  Despite  this, \nIslamic finance has its own set of risks, including movement of commodity prices (a large \nnumber of contracts in Islamic finance are dependent on commodities, which means that the \nprice of oil and commodities impacts IFI balance sheets) and disproportionate exposure to real \nestate.8 This makes development of prudential standards by the IFSB and implementation of \nthese standards important for those ADB members with a sizable Islamic finance sector. In \nrecognition of the growing significance of Islamic finance among its member countries, ADB \njoined the IFSB as an observer in 2003 and became an associate member in 2006. Countries \nin the ADB Southeast Asia Department (SERD) that are full members of the IFSB are Brunei \nDarussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore; the Philippines is an associate member; and \nThailand is an observer. Other ADB DMCs that are full members of the IFSB are Bangladesh, \nthe Maldives, and Pakistan. \n \n4.  The challenge faced by DMCs is to examine how Islamic finance can help improve \naccess  to  alternative  finance,  and  how  it  can  be  developed  in  a  sustainable  way  while \nconsideration is given to its connection with conventional finance and international prudential \nstandards. Through its activities, the IFSB has outlined steps that need to be taken to address \nthese  challenges,  including  (i)  developing  a  set  of  comprehensive  cross-sector  prudential \nstandards and supervisory framework covering Islamic banking, takaful, and capital markets;  \n(ii)  developing  liquidity  management  infrastructure  to  enhance  the  financial  resilience  and \nstability of IFIs; and (iii) developing a macro prudential surveillance framework and financial \nstability analysis. The IFSB has also prepared a medium-term strategy paper incorporating a \nstrategic performance plan for the medium term (2012\u20132015), which was approved by the IFSB \ncouncil in March 2012.9 This plan is broken down into four strategic key result areas and \nfocuses on (i) development of new standards, including expanding into new areas such as \ncapital markets and takaful; and (ii) implementation of IFSB standards by members.10 \n \n5.  The  IFSB  is  planning  to  develop  three  new  takaful-related  standards,  (i)  on  risk \nmanagement, (ii) structure of capital resources for solvency purposes and (iii) use of internal \nmodels for regulatory capital purposes, as well as a guidance paper on stress testing. Guiding \nprinciples on investor protection in Islamic capital markets are also in the pipeline. The focus on \nimplementing standards is validated by findings of the 2011 survey sent to the regulatory and \nsupervisory  authorities,  in  which  the  authorities  were  requested  to  indicate  the  status  of \nimplementation of IFSB standards. Many ADB DMCs responded positively and indicated their \ninterest and plan for implementing these standards. A number of regulatory and supervisory \nauthorities indicated to the IFSB that they need TA to improve their capacity to implement \nstandards. Lack of personnel with relevant knowledge, experience, and training was identified \nas a significant challenge for implementation. Several ADB DMCs requested ADB TA to build \ncapacity  to  implement  these  standards,  including  standards  on  (i)  risk  management  for \ninstitutions  offering  only  Islamic  financial  services,  (ii)  guiding  principles  on  corporate \n                                                \n7 Mohieldin, Iqbal, Rostom, and Fu. 2011. The Role of Islamic Finance in Enhancing Financial Inclusion in OIC \nCountries. Washington, DC: World Bank (December). \n8 These risks are additional to credit, equity, market, liquidity, and operational risks, which also apply to conventional \nfinance.  \n9 The IFSB council consists of governors of central banks including seven from ADB members (Bangladesh, Brunei \nDarussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Maldives, Pakistan, and Singapore). \n10 As of 2012, the IFSB had developed 13 standards and guiding principles. ", "3 \ngovernance for institutions offering only Islamic financial services, and (iii) capital adequacy for \nSukuk. \n \n6.  Development of Islamic finance spans two ADB core areas of operations in Strategy \n2020: regional integration and cooperation, and finance sector development.11 Islamic finance is \npotentially an area of importance in the regional cooperation strategy which is being developed \nas it involves two DMCs in SERD with substantial interest in developing Islamic finance at the \nnational level. Work in this area is also consistent with the strategic focus of ADB\u2019s finance \nsector operation plan including financial inclusion, financial stability, and regional cooperation \nand integration. There is also potential to link this TA with national lending programs, particularly \nin  Indonesia  where  BAPEPAM  LK  (capital  market  and  insurance  regulator)  is  developing \nprudential and governance standards covering the various subsectors of Islamic finance. This \nalso paves the way for ADB\u2019s own strategic partnership with middle-income countries such as \nMalaysia by accumulating knowledge and expertise and demonstrating the ability to develop \nnew areas of competency in Islamic finance to other DMCs. \n \n7.  International experience shows that financial stability initiatives are best undertaken \nthrough regional cooperation as collaboration of many countries is required. ADB can leverage \nthe international membership of the IFSB (189 members) and established outreach programs \nwhile adding value through its own experience in regional cooperation. This opens the channel \nfor exchange of information and knowledge-sharing at the regional level. As of 2012, two \nregional TA projects have been successfully implemented in support of DMCs and the IFSB.12 \nLessons from the  previous TA  projects  have been  incorporated  in  the  design  of the TA:  \n(i) leveraging IFSB outreach programs is necessary and should be complemented with direct \nengagement  with  DMCs  to  better  understand  the  challenges  in  implementing  standards,  \n(ii) effort is needed to link national development programs with activities in regional TA projects \nof  this  kind,  and  (iii)  a  comprehensive  strategy  and  framework  for  countries  that  have \nimplemented the  standards  is  required  to  share  information  and  assist  countries  that  are \ninterested in implementing these standards but have yet to do so.13 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n8.  The focus of the TA will be on (i) supporting the IFSB to continue developing prudential \nstandards in new areas of Islamic finance, disseminating standards through internet modules \nand  simultaneously;  and  (ii)  supporting  DMCs  in  implementing  prudential  standards. \nImplementation  of  this  TA  refers  to  adoption  of  the  necessary  regulatory  framework  in \nparticipating DMCs and capacity building through the IFSB to help adopt this framework. Some \nother strategic areas of support will also be provided, including (i) continuing the work on \nprudential and structural Islamic finance indicators (PSIFI), which was started under ADB\u2019s TA \nfor the Development of Prudential and Supervision Standards for Islamic Financial Markets \n(footnote  13);  (ii)  implementing  strategies  for  Islamic  capital  market  development;  and  \n(iii)  capacity  development  of  common  members  through  workshops  and  seminars.  Thus, \nultimate beneficiaries of the TA are common members of ADB and the IFSB, as the end goal \nand outcome of the TA is to support these members in implementing the standards so that \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2008.

The impact of the TA will be increased financial inclusion through sustainable growth of \nIslamic finance. The indicator for the impact is a 20% increase in the total Islamic banking \nassets, including assets under management in ADB\u2019s participating DMCs. The outcome of the \nTA  will  be  prudential  standards  developed  by  the  IFSB  and  implemented  by  DMCs.  The \nindicator is at least five additional standards adopted by ADB\u2019s participating DMCs by the end of \n2014. The specific outputs are in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The four outputs are mutually reinforcing. The first output is developing the e-module \nplatform for disseminating standards and guidelines. The IFSB regularly conducts financial \nimplementation standards (FIS) workshops in member countries.14 However, the sheer number \nof IFSB members makes it difficult to provide enough FIS workshops. The e-module platform \nwill complement the FIS workshops and enable the IFSB to go into greater detail, as the e-\nmodule can cover the basics. DMCs will be consulted so that the platform developed will be \nuser-friendly and be effectively used to aid the implementation of standards. The second output \nis capacity building to implement prudential standards, including the FIS workshops described \nabove. These workshops can be complemented by comparative case studies of DMCs that \nhave already implemented IFSB standards to assist DMCs that have yet to do so. This is also \nknown as \u2015reverse linkage,\u2016 and Bank Negara Malaysia has indicated interest in partnering ADB \nin this output. The third output is developing an action plan to develop an Islamic capital market \nin participating ADB DMCs. Some key activities that can be included in the action plan are  \n(i)  harmonizing  disclosure  requirements  of  Islamic  capital  market  products,  (ii)  developing \nIslamic collective investment schemes, and (iii) recommending the tax treatment of Islamic \ncapital market products. The final output is reviewing and completing phase 2 of the PSIFI \nproject, which will provide the basis for developing a macro prudential surveillance framework \nand financial stability analysis. The list of activities is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Financial  Sector  Development  Partnership  Fund,15 and  (ii)  $250,000  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, \nboth to be administered by ADB. The Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership \nFund will mainly support the e-module platform, which is in line with its objective of focusing on \ncapacity building and information technology. No activity will be financed in any member country \nunder the TA unless a letter of no objection has been received from its government. The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                \n14 Between November 2007 and December 2011, the IFSB conducted 95 FIS workshops. Bangladesh, Brunei \nDarussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Maldives, and Pakistan were some of the beneficiaries. \n15 Contributor: the Government of Luxembourg. ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The executing agency will be ADB through SERD; the implementing agency will be the \nIFSB. In recognition of the involvement of DMCs beyond SERD (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and \nPakistan), representatives from ADB\u2019s other regional departments will be invited to join the \nimplementation team to aid smoother coordination. The TA will be implemented over 24 months, \nfrom  November  2012  to  November  2014.  It  will  require  29  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services, consisting of (i) a finance sector and statistical expert (5 person-months,) to \nreview and complete the PSIFI project; (ii) a capital market and money market expert (4 person-\nmonths); (iii) an Islamic finance supervision and training expert (6 person-months); and (iv) a \nfinance sector and prudential standards expert (6 person-months) to help the IFSB develop new \nstandards and assist DMCs in implementation, including preparation of the implementation \nframework. These experts will be engaged as individuals. A firm (8 person-months) will be \nengaged for the e-module component. \n \n13.  All consultants will be hired according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n14.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Fund, and (ii) ADB administering \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to be financed on a grant basis \nby the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund for Implementing Prudential \nStandards in Islamic Finance, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nAssumptions and \nDesign Summary  and Indicators with  Reporting \nRisks \nBaselines  Mechanisms \nImpact  By end of 2018:    Assumption \n       \nIncreased financial  Increase in the total  IFSB report and various  Growth not impeded by \ninclusion through  Islamic banking assets in  consultancy groups  another round of \nsustainable growth of  ADB\u2019s participating DMCs  such as Ernst & Young  financial crisis \nIslamic finance  by 20% (baseline: Islamic   \nbanking assets  Kuwait Finance House \nAfghanistan, June  research papers \n2012=$152.2 million; \nBangladesh \n2011=$11,677.1 million; \nIndonesia, \n2011=$15,490.4 million; \nand Pakistan, \n2011=$6,760.8 million)a \nOutcome  By end of 2014:    Assumption \n       \nPrudential standards  At least five additional  IFSB website and  IFSB continues to \ndeveloped by IFSB  standards adopted by  consultation with DMCs  explore and expand \nand implemented by  ADB\u2019s participating DMCs  scope for new \nDMCs  (2012 baseline: 13  standards, including \nstandards developed and  capital market \n8 standardsb   \nimplemented) \nOutputs  By end of 2014:    Assumptions \n       \n1.
