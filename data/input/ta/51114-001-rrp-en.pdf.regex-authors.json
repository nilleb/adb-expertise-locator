THE PROPOSAL \n \n  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed results-\nbased loan to the State Electricity Corporation (PLN), to be guaranteed by the Republic of \nIndonesia, for the Sustainable Energy Access in Eastern Indonesia (SEAEI)\u2014Electricity Grid \nDevelopment Program (Phase 2).1 The report also describes the proposed administration of two \ngrants: one to be provided by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and the other to be \nprovided by the Asian Clean Energy Fund (ACEF) under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership \nFacility, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to \nme by the Board, approve the administration of both grants.2 \n \n  SEAEI is a multi-year initiative with a series of interrelated lending programs and projects \nin Eastern Indonesia covering power generation, transmission, and distribution.3 The SEAEI\u2014\nElectricity Grid Development Program, approved in 2017, covers the regions of Sulawesi and \nNusa Tenggara (Phase 1).4 Phase 2 will cover the remaining regions of Eastern Indonesia, \nnamely Kalimantan, Maluku, and Papua. The program aims to enhance access to sustainable \nand modern energy services in the target regions as envisioned in PLN\u2019s Electricity Power Supply \nBusiness Plan (RUPTL), 2019\u20132028, which will improve connectivity and help the regions\u2019 \nresponse to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) impacts.5 The program also addresses a key priority \nof the government\u2019s National Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2020\u20132024 to stimulate \nmore inclusive growth with a focus on Eastern Indonesia.6 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Strategic Context \n \n  Progress and challenges. Indonesia\u2019s economy is the world\u2019s eighth largest in terms of \npurchasing power parity and has doubled in size since 2000. The decline in the poverty rate \n(19.1% in 2000 to 9.7% in 2018) has been remarkable, with 13.1 million people lifted out of poverty \nin 18 years albeit at risk of being reversed by COVID-19 impact. However, growth has been largely \ncentered  around  Java,  and  regional  disparities  remain  stark.7 In  Eastern  Indonesia,  poor \ninfrastructure\u2014for energy, transport, and communications\u2014constrains its high growth potential. \n \n  National priorities. Expanded electrification, with a priority on regions outside Java, is an \nimportant  element  of  the  government\u2019s  infrastructure  investment  plan.  The  plan  includes \nincreasing (i) the electrification ratio from 89% in 2016 to near 100% by 2024, (ii) the power \ngeneration capacity from 56.5 gigawatts in 2018 to 112.2 gigawatts in 2028, and (iii) the share of \nrenewable energy in the national energy mix from 13% in 2016 to 23% in 2025.8 PLN is the sole \n \n1 The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) provided  transaction  technical assistance  (TA).

Jakarta. \n ", " \n2 \nstate-owned power utility in Indonesia and, together with its subsidiaries, is responsible for the \ngeneration,  transmission,  distribution,  and  retail  sale  of  electricity.  The  government  has \nundertaken several reform measures, including (i) expanding the role of the private sector and \nimproving  the  investment  climate,  (ii)  adjusting  tariffs  to  better  reflect  costs  and  initiating \nperformance-based measures to reduce state subsidy requirements, and (iii) strengthening PLN\u2019s \ngovernance and financial capacity to undertake the aggressive infrastructure investment plan.9 \nIndependent power producers are expected to account for 75% of new power capacity, with \n$57.5 billion of private sector financing, while PLN needs sovereign funding support for electricity \ngrid development to fulfill its public service obligations, particularly in the outer provinces where \ncost recovery is challenged by tariff affordability. The government\u2019s approach balances the need \nfor reforms to boost efficiency and service quality while striving to achieve universal electricity \naccess with a priority on Eastern Indonesia, which poses the biggest challenge because of its \nvast and isolated geography and fragmented power grids. \n \n  ADB support. The programmatic support by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nEastern Indonesia in the energy sector includes (i) policy and regulatory support through the \nSustainable  and  Inclusive  Energy  Program  policy-based  loan, 10  (ii)  the  Electricity  Grid \nDevelopment Program results-based lending (RBL) program for Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara \n(footnote 4), (iii) wind and solar renewable energy projects in Sulawesi and Nusa Tenggara \nthrough nonsovereign operations,11 (iv) a proposed sector project for small- to medium-scale \nnatural gas-fired power plants with pilot gas\u2013solar hybrid systems, and (v) other complementary \nprojects and RBL programs.12, The program includes incentives to expand the use of renewable \nsources from both public and private sector investments and, together with other ADB support in \nthe sector, will help enhance access to sustainable energy services, consistent with Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 7 of affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all, and the Paris \nAgreement  on  climate  change.13 These  operations  are  consistent  with  and  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s reform agenda and efforts to strengthen governance and institutional capacity. \n \nB.  Program Rationale \n \n  Households classified as \u201cnot electrified\u201d or \u201cpoorly electrified\u201d account for 56% of all \nhouseholds in Papua, 15% in West Papua, 20% in both Maluku and North Maluku, 28% in Central \nKalimantan, 18% in North Kalimantan, and 21% in West Kalimantan, versus a national average \nof 4%.14 These areas are mainly serviced, if at all, by diesel-fired generators, which are inefficient, \npolluting, and expensive. Limited access to electricity compounds the broader development \n \n9  Government subsidies, which include a public service obligation margin of 7%, declined from 33% of PLN\u2019s total \nrevenues in 2014 to 21% in 2019. The government has significantly streamlined business licensing processes, \nexpanded financial guarantees, and provided targets for PLN on private sector procurement.

Poorly electrified households are those that receive intermittent power \nfrom small diesel generators and poorly maintained solar plants. \n ", " \n3 \nchallenges in the target provinces. Papua, West Papua, and West Kalimantan have some of the \nlowest human development indexes, while these provinces and East and North Kalimantan have \nthe lowest gender development indexes in Indonesia. Women\u2019s share of income is low in all \nprovinces of Kalimantan, Maluku, and Papua, with the lowest share in East (23%) and North \n(26%) Kalimantan, versus a national average of 37%.15 Disaggregated data is not available and \nthere is a need to measure the impact of electrification programs on social development. \n \n  COVID-19 impact. Indonesia is among the hardest-hit countries in Southeast Asia by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. The economy is expected to contract by 1%, down from 5.0% growth in \n2019 and from 5.4% growth originally expected for 2020.16 In order to cushion the economic \nshocks to the poor during the pandemic, along with other measures the government announced \nfree electricity for 24 million households in the 450-volt ampere (VA) category, and a 50% discount \nfor 7 million households in the 900 VA category.17 This has affected PLN\u2019s revenues, and PLN \nrequires financial support to enhance its quality and coverage of services. Reliable electricity is a \nprerequisite to continue work, education, and essential health and public services especially when \nphysical movement is restricted.18 The program would enable ADB to support economic recovery \nin Eastern Indonesia and contribute to more equitable and resilient growth post COVID-19. \n \n  The program. The program will enhance sustainable, equitable, and reliable access to \nelectricity for the population in nine provinces in Kalimantan, Maluku, and Papua and finance a \nslice of the broader program in the RUPTL 2019\u20132028. PLN has a financing gap for power \ndelivery to communities, including through the use of cost efficient local renewable sources, for \nwhich it is seeking ADB support under the proposed program. \n \n  Electrification impacts. Increased electrification has been shown to result in improved \ndevelopment  outcomes,  including  increased  incomes,  higher  school  attendance,  reduced \nrespiratory illness, and improved time poverty especially for women. An important lesson from \nprograms in other countries is that consumer education and training are essential to achieve such \nimproved development outcomes.19 \n \n  Modality. The RBL modality is suitable as it will (i) increase accountability for delivering \nand sustaining results (e.g., by ensuring that community-level solar installations are functioning); \n(ii) consolidate gains in institutional strengthening from previous RBL programs;20 (iii) fit with the \ngovernment\u2019s fast-expanding universal electrification strategy and efforts to enhance PLN\u2019s \nefficiency  and  governance,  through  internal  controls  for  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E), \nprocurement, and financial reporting; (iv) reduce high transaction costs associated with small, \nscattered investments; and (v) stimulate financing and harmonization with other development \npartners (footnote 2). The program will incorporate lessons from the previous RBL programs, such \nas the need to further strengthen PLN\u2019s internal M&E, waste and asset management, support \n \n15 Ministry of Women\u2019s Empowerment & Child Protection and Badan Pusat Statistik (Indonesian Central Statistical \nOffice). 2018.

An impact study (with sex-disaggregated data) \nwill develop lessons for future programs.21 \n \n  Value added by ADB. ADB\u2019s value addition to the sector comes from being the first \npartner to support sustainable energy access through the RBL modality, and able to leverage \ninstitutional  improvements  such  as  asset  and  waste  management,  least-cost  planning  for \nelectrification with use of renewable energy systems, procurement tracking, and social impact \nmonitoring. These will help ensure sustainability and strengthen PLN\u2019s capacity. RBL operations \nare well coordinated with its key development partners.22 Previous RBL programs are cofinanced \nwith  the  World  Bank  and  German  development  cooperation  through  KfW  (footnote  20). \nCollaboration will be pursued for the proposed program with the Japan International Cooperation \nAgency and the governments of Australia and New Zealand. The program is aligned with ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030  (Table  1),  country  partnership  strategy  for  Indonesia,  2020\u20132024  which \nemphasizes inclusive growth with support for local and regional economic development, and \nincluded in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan for Indonesia, 2020\u20132022.23 \n \nTable 1: Alignment with Strategy 2030 \nStrategy 2030 Priorities  Contribution \nAddressing remaining poverty  Reducing poverty and improving livelihoods by connecting more than 893,700 \nand reducing inequalities  households in Eastern Indonesia, including at least 112,428 poor households \nAccelerating progress in gender  Connecting at least 11,243 poor households headed by women and tracking \nequality  female-headed households in PLN\u2019s M&E system; reducing time spent by \nwomen for household work; ensuring female participation in community \nworkshops on safe and productive use of electricity \nTackling climate change, building  Increasing the use of clean energy systems for rural electrification; emphasizing \nclimate and disaster resilience,  results through power generation from renewable energy systems, rather than \nand enhancing environmental  additional generation capacity, which may not be properly maintained \nsustainability \nPromoting rural development and  Targeting rural regions with low electrification rates; expanding livelihood options \nfood security  and supporting the development of cold storage for food and medicine \nStrengthening governance and  Strengthening governance and institutional capacity on internal M&E, asset and \ninstitutional capacity  waste management, procurement, financial reporting, and sustainable operation \nand maintenance of small renewable energy systems in remote areas \nM&E = monitoring and evaluation, PLN = Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nC.

Program Results \n \n      Results chain. The RBL program\u2019s impact is aligned with the RUPTL goal of enhancing \nthe quality of life in Indonesian society through the use of electricity (footnote 5). The outcome will \nbe sustainable, equitable, and reliable access to electricity for the population in Kalimantan, \nMaluku, and Papua enhanced. Three disbursement-linked indicators (DLIs) at the outcome level \nfocus on (i) the number of customers (DLI 1); (ii) the number of poor households electrified (DLI 2), \nsupported by the JFPR grant, with a target that at least 10% of electrified households be headed \nby women;24 and (iii) the reliability of services, as measured by the reduction in feeder line \npermanent interruptions (DLI 3). A baseline study and impact evaluation will measure social \noutcome indicators such as improved time use, separately for women and men.25 Three output-\nlevel results contribute to the outcomes: \n(i)  Output 1. Power distribution network strengthened and expanded. This will \nbe tracked by the installed length of medium-voltage distribution lines (DLI 4). \n(ii)  Output 2. Renewable energy use increased. Electricity provided to communities \nin the target areas will be from a mix of power sources, including small diesel \ngenerators, which is the most common for remote grids. Output 2, supported by \nthe ACEF grant, explicitly focuses on increasing power generation from solar \nphotovoltaic, mini and micro-hydro, and small biogas power plants (DLI 5).26 \n(iii)  Output  3.  Institutional  capacity  strengthened  and  social  monitoring \nenhanced. Output 3 focuses on improving asset and waste management (DLI 6) \nand on enhancing social and gender aspects through PLN workshops on safe and \nproductive energy use, with at least 30% female participation (DLI 7). Electronic \nprocurement and contract payment systems will be integrated (DLI 8).27 \n \n  These three outputs are sufficient to achieve the outcome, and the DLIs and other \nperformance indicators provide ambitious yet achievable measures of progress toward outputs \nand outcome.

The  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2017, as amended from time to time) and \ndetailed arrangements agreed upon between the borrower and ADB. PLN will submit a withdrawal \napplication reporting on the achievement of the DLIs, and disbursement will be made subject to \nverification by an IVA in accordance with the agreed verification protocols (Appendix 3). If a target \nhas not been fully achieved but partial disbursement has been agreed for that DLI, ADB will \ndetermine the amount to be disbursed based on the level of achievement. Loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed to PLN\u2019s general account with a commercial bank. Grant proceeds will be disbursed to \nseparate accounts set up by PLN for each grant. Advance financing under the loan and both \nJFPR and ACEF grants, and financing for prior results under the loan and JFPR grant will be \nmade available to address financing requirements as needed within the RBL policy limits.32 PLN \nwill refund any advance financing amount outstanding if the DLIs are not achieved. \n \nF.  Capacity Development and Program Action Plan \n \n  Various assessments have identified capacity gaps for implementing the RBL program \n(paras. 22\u201335). Based on these assessments, a PAP was developed to enhance PLN\u2019s capacity \n(in addition to strengthening through the three output-level institutional strengthening DLIs). The \nPAP includes actions in specific technical areas, M&E, fiduciary management, and safeguards to \nstrengthen PLN systems, help achieve DLIs, and make the program results more sustainable. \nThe PAP will focus on implementation capacity, which will complement physical investments \nunder the program and contribute to PLN\u2019s overall efforts to increase the capacity of its staff and \nimprove institutional monitoring and reporting systems. \n \nG.  Grant Assistance \n  Connections for poor households, a social and gender impact evaluation study, and PLN \nworkshops on safe and productive electricity use will be supported by the JFPR grant proceeds.33 \nThe rehabilitation and upgrading of solar photovoltaic systems using advanced technology, \nincluding improvements in system design and maintenance procedures, will be supported by \nACEF grant proceeds. \n \nH.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n  PLN is the executing agency. Program implementation will be undertaken by PLN\u2019s \nadministrative  regional  units  (UIWs)  and  units  that  report  to  them\u2014the  Customer  Service \nImplementation Units (UP3s), Electricity Project Implementation Units (UP2Ks), and Customer \nServices Units (ULPs)\u2014in Kalimantan, Maluku, and Papua, with oversight by PLN headquarters \nin Jakarta.34 The program will be implemented from January 2020 to December 2025.35 \n \n32 Financing for prior results will not be applicable under the ACEF grant. \n33 Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction Grant (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Unit Pelaksana Pelayanan Pelanggan (UP3) was previously called Area; Unit Layanan Pelanggan (ULP) was \npreviously called Rayon; and Key PLN divisions in headquarters have developed good capacity to plan and manage \nRBL programs because of their experience with previous RBL programs (footnote 20). \n35 Program Implementation Document (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", " \n9 \nIII.  SUMMARY OF ASSESSMENTS \n \nA.  Program Technical Assessments \n \n  A review of the technical soundness of the program shows that the power distribution \ndesign is simple and straightforward, and generally follows international practice. Overall, PLN\u2019s \nplan to develop the power systems in Kalimantan, Maluku, and Papua is operationally viable and \ncan be expected to increase service coverage and reliability.36 These conclusions underpin the \nresults areas, key actions to be taken, and performance indicators for the sector overall, and the \nRBL program in particular. \n \n  The program\u2019s poverty reduction and social impact cuts across many sectors including \ntourism, health, fisheries, and agroindustry. Over 890,000 households (including the poorest and \nthe most remote) will benefit from having electricity access. Children will be able to read and study \nin the evenings, and indoor air quality will improve as fuel lamps are eliminated. Women and men \nwill be able to communicate better and access information via their phones. Village schools and \nhealth centers will benefit from lighting, refrigeration, and equipment for vaccination. The program \nwill also expand electricity access to small and medium-sized businesses, and can contribute to \nsubstantial job growth, which will support the post-COVID recovery for Eastern Indonesia. 37 \n \n  Gender mainstreaming is addressed by two DLIs. DLI 2 will ensure that poor households \nheaded by women are provided with reliable and affordable electricity supply, which will reduce \nthe time and effort spent by women to obtain other fuels, enable women to run income-generating \nactivities in their homes, and acquire knowledge through telecommunications.38 Communities will \nbe able to pump and store water, while having well-lit streets will deter crime and enhance safety \nfor girls and women. DLI 7 (on consumer education) requires at least 30% female participation in \nthe community workshops (with incentives to reach 50%).39 Gender mainstreaming is also \nsupported through community training on basic solar photovoltaic maintenance, with a focus on \nwomen\u2019s involvement. \n \n  The program will generate positive net incremental economic benefits from the additional \nelectricity supply. The program\u2019s economic viability is assessed on the basis of a network system \napproach for the entire PLN program in Kalimantan, Maluku, and Papua, as the benefits are \ndependent on interlinked investments in generation, transmission, and distribution. \n  \nB.  Program Systems Assessments \n \n  Monitoring and evaluation systems. PLN\u2019s corporate M&E system has the capacity to \ntrack all DLIs as well as other indicators. Of the eight DLIs, PLN\u2019s Management Reporting \nInformation System already monitors DLIs 1, 3, 4, and 5, while other systems can complement \nand/or monitor DLIs 5, 6, and 8. The remaining indicators (DLIs 2 and 7) relate to the gender and \nsocial dimensions of the RBL program, and PLN is introducing special procedures to strengthen \nits information systems at both the field and central levels to report properly on these dimensions \nfor the first time. Monthly reports provide comprehensive data on all aspects of PLN\u2019s operation, \n \n36 Program Soundness Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n37 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n38 In Bhutan this gave women greater self-confidence and more of a voice in household decisions (footnote 19). \n39 The 30% minimum threshold is established because local officials\u2014mainly men\u2014would attend this activity. In \naddition, since the project is spread out in many remote villages, pregnant women and women with young children \nmay find it difficult to travel to the workshop venue if held outside the village. \n ", " \n10 \nand are reviewed at monthly consultations between PLN headquarters and UIW staff. IVA reports \nfrom the previous two RBL programs are being used to strengthen PLN\u2019s M&E systems. \n \n  Fiduciary  systems.  The  program  will  use  PLN\u2019s  fiduciary  systems  for  financial \nmanagement, procurement, and audit. These systems were assessed to determine their ability to \nmanage fiduciary risks and provide assurance that the RBL program funds will be used as \nintended, with due consideration for economy and efficiency.40 The fiduciary assessment found \nthat consolidated financial reporting and budgeting improvements were required. These fiduciary \nsystem improvements will be addressed through system enhancements in the PAP, with relevant \nstaff required to attend training for these systems. \n \n  Financial management. A financial management assessment of PLN was carried out in \n2015 (footnote 20) and 2017 (footnote 4), and updated for the program. The assessment was \nconducted with reference to relevant ADB guidance on financial management and concluded that \nPLN\u2019s financial management systems are adequate for the RBL program, with improvements \nneeded in terms of timely budget execution and accounting and reporting. Administrative delays \nresulting in government financial support for PLN were identified as a risk. ADB, the World Bank, \nand other development partners will continue to mitigate this risk through ongoing TA support to \nstrengthen public financial management arrangements (footnote 28). \n \n  PLN has been mandated to execute a significant investment program against a backdrop \nof uncertainty especially with COVID-19 impacts and volatile fuel prices, inflation, interest rate, \nand foreign exchange.41 This presents a challenge to PLN\u2019s financial management, and the \nmonitoring and early detection of deteriorating financial performance is addressed in the PAP. \nContinued government support is critical to ensure PLN\u2019s financial sustainability and to achieve \nthe program\u2019s objectives. ADB and PLN will coordinate closely with the Ministry of Finance.42 \n \n  Procurement.  A  procurement  assessment  covered  the  (i)  procurement  profile; \n(ii) regulations,  rules,  and  procedures;  (iii)  organizational  arrangements  and  capacity;  and \n(iv) system performance.43 The program will rely on PLN\u2019s systems and will exclude high-value \ncontracts in accordance with ADB\u2019s RBL policy. The scope of procurement for the RBL program \ninclude: materials, works and service contracts for distribution lines; engineering, procurement, \nand construction of small renewable energy systems; and goods and works for in-house wiring. \nPLN will procure the materials for distribution centrally through limited bidding and framework \ncontracts. The procurement of works and installation services will be carried out by the UIW offices \nand their subsidiary units. Procurement of advanced technology elements, such as remote \nmonitoring and energy management systems, will be carried out following PLN\u2019s open competitive \nbidding procedures that allow participation by international bidders. \n \n  Previous RBL procurement risk assessments (conducted in 2015 and 2017) rated the \noverall risks as moderate. The procurement assessment finds the moderate rating still valid. The \nmain deficiencies and risks in PLN\u2019s procurement system are (i) lack of an integrated information \ntechnology system to report, monitor, and analyze procurement and contract data; (ii) limitations \n \n40 Program Fiduciary Systems Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n41 For example, the government announced in 2014 a program to add 35 gigawatts of new power generation capacity \nby 2019. This timeline has subsequently been extended. \n42 Program Expenditure and Financing Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \nincludes information on key financial risks and mitigants for PLN, including those related to COVID-19; and to support \nPLN during its significant capital investment growth phase, the program proposes modified financial covenants, which \nwill be applied consistently to all ADB loans under implementation. \n43 Procurement Assessment of Perusahaan Listrik Negara (State Electricity Corporation) (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", " \n11 \non international bidders who wish to participate, because of requirements for local content; (iii) \nthe use of procurement methods with limited competition; (iv) insufficient procurement capacity \nor capacity of local contractors to scale up procurement under the program, especially in UIWs; \nand (v) insufficient procurement planning, which may lead to implementation delays. A key lesson \nfrom previous RBL programs is the low level of utilization of the contract monitoring application \nand lack of integration with the contract payment system. These will be addressed through DLI 8 \nof the proposed program. Other key procurement risks will be addressed through the PAP. \n \n  Integrity due diligence was conducted.44 The Guidelines to Prevent or Mitigate Fraud, \nCorruption,  and  Other  Prohibited  Activities  in  Results-Based  Lending  for  Programs  were \nexplained to and discussed with PLN.45 \n \n  Safeguard  systems.  The  program  is  expected  to  generate  significant  positive \nenvironmental  and  social  benefits  from  reduced  indoor  kerosene  and  wood  consumption. \nPromotion of renewable energy use will also lead to greenhouse gas emission reductions and \nhealth benefits. The program safeguard system assessment, undertaken by ADB with PLN  \ndrawing on previous related assessments, confirmed the safeguards classification of category B \nfor environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.46 The adverse environmental \nimpacts of eligible activities under the program are anticipated to be minimal to minor, site-specific, \nreversible, and can be mitigated to acceptable levels through good construction practices. No \nimpact is anticipated to result in irreversible and permanent damage. No physical displacement \nor relocation of people is anticipated. The expansion of distribution lines will require 0.2 square \nmeters (for concrete poles) to 24 square meters (for pad mounted and on-ground distribution \ntransformers) of land. Village-level power generation facilities will require 0.2 hectares to 2.0 \nhectares of land. There are customary communities in the project area, and some of the land \nused for the program may be owned by indigenous peoples groups. Program impact will not be \nsignificant, as it will involve minor land losses and will not lead to relocation for the communities. \nActions to strengthen meaningful consultations, screening process to ensure the exclusion of \ncategory A activities, and provision of programs on access and awareness of electricity to \nindigenous peoples have been included in the safeguard program actions.     \n \n  The program safeguard systems currently in place are broadly aligned with the objectives, \nscope, and triggers of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and considered generally \nacceptable.47 PLN has established a relatively comprehensive system of guidelines and decrees \nthat supplement the national regulatory framework for environmental and social safeguards. PLN \nhas a robust institutional structure with broadly adequate staffing, with ongoing deployment of \nadditional safeguards specialists at the UIW, UP3, and ULP levels. Gaps in safeguard systems \nhave been identified with respect to (i) PLN\u2019s institutional capacity, especially at the UIW, UP3, \nand  ULP  levels;  (ii)  environmental  and  social  safeguards  screening;  (iii)  transparent  and \nconsistent procedures for negotiated land acquisition and donation; (iv) monitoring and reporting; \n(v) asset and waste management; (vi) warehouses operating without permits; and (vii) meaningful \nconsultation, including involvement of vulnerable, indigenous, and customary community groups, \nand awareness raising on electrical safety. These will be addressed through DLI 6 (asset and \nwaste management and warehouse permits) and the PAP, including a screening mechanism to \nensure that the RBL program excludes activities that would be classified as category A in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n44 Integrity Disclosure (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) includes information on the recent \ninvestigation by the Corruption Eradication Commission. \n45 ADB. 2018.

While the \nIndonesian Central Statistical Office defines a female-headed household as one where a woman is the family \nbreadwinner or considered the head of the family, local governments classify a household as female-headed only \nwhen the woman is widowed or divorced. The RBL program will use the local government definition, as this is the \nonly data that is regularly available at the local level.  \nc PLN and local governments identify poor households through a database updated yearly. The updates by the local \ngovernments are provided to PLN, as poor households are entitled to receive subsidies for electricity tariffs. \nd PLN defines permanent interruptions as those over 5 minutes in duration. \ne Environmental Permit and License to Operate Hazardous Waste Disposal. \nf  Female participation is at a minimum of 30% because (i) village and district officials must be included in the \nworkshops and they are mostly men, and (ii) most workshops are held at the UP3 level (not at the village level) and \nwill require women to travel away from their homes, which is difficult for women with young children. \ng  Scoring system: one workshop with 30% female participation will count as 1.0 point, while one workshop with 50% \nfemale participation will count as 1.25 points. \nh The output indicator 3d is not related to the outcome indicator d. The output indicator 3d strengthens PLN\u2019s capacity \nto report on social dimensions and impact of its work, while the outcome indicator d measures social and gender \nimpact by an independent evaluation. \ni  The Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) grant will support outcome indicator b (DLI 2) and outcome indicator \nd; output indicator 3b(DLI 7); and the initial framework for the first report for output indicator 3d.
