The Government of Samoa has requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical \nassistance (TA) to support its efforts to promote the economic use of customary land. The \ngovernment\u2019s commitment to promoting the economic use of customary land is expressed in \nkey outcome 5 of the Samoa Development Strategy, 2012\u20132016,1 which focuses on improving \nthe enabling environment for business development. One of the strategic areas identified under \nthis outcome is raising the efficiency and effectiveness of the public service to support the \nprivate sector and the community. The proposed TA has been included in the TA program for \n2013  of  the  ADB  country  operations  business  plan,  2014\u20132016.2 The  country  operations \nbusiness plan supports the Samoa Development Strategy by targeting improved delivery of \npublic services, including the removal of constraints to infrastructure investment, and promotion \nof private sector development, which directly links to key outcome 5 of the Samoa Development \nStrategy. \n \n2.  An ADB fact-finding mission was conducted between 23\u201326 July 2013 to reach an \nunderstanding with the government on the objectives and scope of the TA, cost estimates, \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and detailed terms of reference for consulting \nservices. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  More than 80% of all businesses in Samoa have five employees or less. These micro \nand small enterprises generally lack equity and access to bank lending to provide a sustainable \nfinancing base for their enterprise. With at least 80% of land under customary communal \nownership that cannot be alienated either by sale or mortgage, most enterprises have limited \nchoices  of  acceptable  securities  that  they  can  offer  to  access  financial  services.  While \ncustomary land is available, micro and small enterprises cannot use such land as collateral \nbecause (i) property rights (until recently) could not be mortgaged, (ii) the status of leases as \ncollateral is legally certain but is often discouraged by lending institutions, (iii) security of tenure \nmay not be guaranteed even when leasehold title is obtained, and (iv) the lease approval \nprocess is cumbersome  and  can take  up  to 12  months.  The  limited  freehold  land  that  is \navailable for securing loans from commercial banks is concentrated around the Apia urban area. \nTherefore, the problem of access to financial services is compounded for rural businesses in \nUpolu and Savai\u2019i. Enforceability problems and the state of the relevant registries discourages \ncommercial banks from using chattels as acceptable securities. \n \n4.  There is also high demand for customary lands from foreign investors. However, the \nlandowners need to organize themselves to take advantage of this. The Alienation of Customary \nLand Act, 1965 recognizes that the matai (family chief) can, on behalf of the family, offer to \nlease the family\u2019s customary land should there be an interested investor. However, while the \nland is registered in the name of the matai, the legal system recognizes all members of the \ngroup as owners. Any dealing with foreign investors therefore requires that all members of the \nlandowning group are identified and have their names recorded on any land dealing, and all \nmembers of the landowning group (including absentee owners) must consent to any dealing. \nThese requirements prolong the approval process and discourage long-term land development. \n                                                 \n1  Government of Samoa. 2012.

Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 2 October 2013.  \n ", "2 \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s involvement in promoting the economic use of customary land in Samoa began \nwith exploratory work under component 4 of the Small Business Development Project and the \nassociated TA for Capacity Building of Financial and Business Development Intermediaries, \nwhich aimed to improve the policy and legislative environment for small business development. 4 \nThe Small Business Development Project explored ways to improve the access of micro and \nsmall enterprises to credit, including through establishing leasehold on customary land. Under \nthe subsequent TA for Promoting Economic Use of Customary Land, a program implementation \nplan  was  prepared  that  recommended  (i)  establishment  of  a  customary  land  advisory \ncommission (CLAC), (ii) setting up of a one-stop shop for customary land matters, and (iii) \nextensive use of community advocacy. 5 \n \n6.  ADB provided further technical assistance to assist the government in (i) establishing the \nCLAC through the CLAC Act, 2013; (ii) setting up the Customary Land Leasing Section; and (iii) \namending the Alienation of Customary Land Act, 1965 to allow the mortgage of customary land \nleases. 6 CLAC was formed to (i) advise the Cabinet on the facilitation, encouragement, and \npromotion  of  economic  use  of  customary  land;  (ii)  conduct  public  consultations  on  areas \naffecting customary land considered to be in need of reform; and (iii) review all laws affecting \ncustomary land in Samoa and make recommendations to the Cabinet for changes to such laws. \nThe Customary Land Leasing Section, which is housed within the Ministry of Natural Resources \nand Environment, now acts as the one-stop shop where landowners and investors can get \ninformation and advice on customary land.  \n \n7.  To support this initiative, the government set up an office and provided office equipment \nfor  CLAC,  established  an  independent  secretariat  (separate  from  the  existing  government \nstructure) to support CLAC, and provided resources in the national budget to support the \noperation  of  CLAC  for  7  years  (commissions  would  normally  operate  for  2  years).  The \ngovernment has also ensured that a legal framework is in place to promote the economic use of \ncustomary land. While the use of customary land as mortgage is prohibited under Article 102 of \nthe Constitution of Samoa, the mortgage of customary leasehold interest is now possible. \n \n8.  To support the mortgaging of customary leasehold, there is a need to put in place a \nlease framework. The lease framework will allow for (i) creating a security interest in leases, (ii) \nestablishing priority for the lender, (iii) publicizing security interests in leases so that interested \nparties can establish if a lease has already been pledged as security, and (iv) creating a \nprocess for repossessing and selling the lease in the event of default. The lease framework \nmust be consistent with Samoa\u2019s seven principles of dealing with customary land (para. 9), but \nmust allow for ready sale of leases if the borrower defaults.  \n \n9.  In discussing the economic use of customary land, the TA will ensure that it operates \nwithin Samoa\u2019s seven principles (enshrined in written laws and Samoa\u2019s culture) of dealing with \ncustomary land:  \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2000.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the TA will be improved access to credit for business investment. This will \nbe measured by credit to the private sector increasing from 43% of gross domestic product in \n2012 to 50% in 2019 based on annual figures of the Central Bank of Samoa. The outcome will \nbe  the  use  of  customary  land  leases  as  collateral.  The  achievement  will  be  reflected  in \ncommercial banks accepting customary land leases as collateral.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  Section 15 of the CLAC Act allows the mortgage of customary land leases. However, \ndespite their willingness to move into this area, commercial banks are yet to take advantage of \nthis because of different legal interpretations of Section 102 of the Constitution of Samoa; \nSection 4 of the Alienation of Customary Land Act, 1965; and Section 15 of the CLAC Act, 2013. \nThis is despite an independent legal opinion (sought by the Office of the Attorney General) that \nthe  mortgage  of  customary  land  leases  is  now  possible.  To  discuss  and  resolve  these \ndifferences, the TA is expected to provide the following outputs. \n \n12.  Output  1:  A  functional  legal  working  group  established.  Given  that  the  legal \nframework is in place to allow the mortgage of customary land leases, CLAC will establish a \nlegal working group (LWG) to work closely with the Banking Association of Samoa to discuss \nfurther actions required to enable commercial banks to take advantage of this legal framework \nand accept customary land leases as collateral. As a test case, an overseas investor has \napproached ANZ Bank (Samoa branch) to borrow money using as collateral the customary land \nlease they obtained from one of the villages. CLAC and the LWG will work closely with the ANZ \nBank,  the  overseas  investor,  and  the  government  to  broker  this  deal  and  establish  the \nprecedent. \n \n13.  Output 2: Leasing framework established. The TA will assist CLAC to establish a \nleasing framework for the use of customary leasehold as collateral. In establishing the leasing \nframework, the TA will ensure that the framework addresses four issues: (i) the process for the \nregistration of a security interest, (ii) perfection of the security interest, (iii) the publicizing of \nsecurity interests in leases, and (iv) the process for repossessing and reselling the lease in the \nevent of default. \n \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $480,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff, office accommodation, and office supplies. The \ngovernment has also allocated sufficient resources in its 2014 budget to support the operation \nof CLAC and has committed to continue to support CLAC for the next 7 years. The detailed cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The Ministry of Finance will be the executing agency for the TA and will ensure that TA \nactivities are closely coordinated with the implementing agencies (Ministry of Natural Resources \nand Environment, and Ministry of Justice and Courts Administration). CLAC will act as the \nconduit to the Cabinet when decisions require higher endorsement. CLAC will be supported by \nits secretariat as well as the LWG. Given the sensitivity of issues around customary land, \nconsultations with civil society and nongovernment organizations will be done regularly.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over a 3-year period from January 2014 to December 2016. \nThe 3 year timeframe is based on the need to ensure that the government have enough time to \nconsult the stakeholders given the sensitivity of land reform in Samoa. The TA is expected to \nfinance 8 person-months of intermittent international consulting services and 14 person-months \nof national consulting services. The consultant team will have a team leader and program \ncoordinator (national, 10 person-months), a legal specialist (international, 8 person-months), \nand a legal adviser (national, 4 person-months). The international consultant will be a senior \ntechnical specialist in his or her field with extensive experience in small-island states. The \nconsultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3. Proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n17.  The team leader will produce a concise inception report outlining the work program and \nmilestones for the duration of the TA, and a final report summarizing the achievements, issues, \nlessons learned, and next steps. The TA will also prepare knowledge products (policy briefs, \ndetailed project description on the process, and implementation of customary land reform in \nSamoa) given the interest on land reform in the rest of the Pacific Island Countries. Throughout \nthe TA, the team leader will submit (by email) brief monthly progress reports summarizing TA \nactivities, progress, issues, and constraints. The final report will be submitted in draft form at \nleast 5 weeks prior to the end of the assignment, and the final report within 2 weeks of receipt \nof comments from the government and ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Samoa for Promoting Economic Use of Customary Land, Phase III, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5   \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved access to  Credits to private sector  Central Bank of Samoa  High-level political \ncredit for business  increase to 50% of GDP by  financial reports  commitment is \ninvestment  2019  maintained \n  (2012 baseline: 43%)   \n  Risk \nPublic opposition \nbecause of lack of \ninformation \nOutcome      Assumption \nUse of customary land  Commercial banks accept  Commercial bank  General support from \nleases as collateral   customary land leases as  reports  financial institutions on \ncollateral by 2016    the use of customary \n    land leases as \n    collateral  \n   \nRisk \nFamily disputes \ndiscourage \ncommercial banks \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
