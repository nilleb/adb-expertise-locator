The transaction involves the administration by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) of an \ninvestment of up to the equivalent of $2,000,000, with an initial investment of up to $500,000 as \na convertible promissory note in a nonoperating holding company called Fairbanc Pte. Ltd. \n(Fairbanc) in Singapore to expand its operations in Indonesia (conducted through its operating \nsubsidiary in Indonesia, PT Fairbanc Technologies Indonesia), to be provided by the ADB \nVentures Investment Fund 11 under the ADB Ventures Financing Partnership Facility.  The \nbalance of the approved amount may be invested in subsequent fundraising rounds that Fairbanc \nis  expected  to  undertake  by  June  2024  as  equity  or  quasi-equity.  Consistent  with  the \nestablishment arrangements for the fund, ADB will not invest its own capital alongside the fund.2 \n \n2.  Fairbanc is a financial technology (fintech) company with primary operations in Indonesia \nthat partners with fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) distributors to offer digital microcredit to \nmicro,  small,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  for  inventory  purchases.  Fairbanc\u2019s \npropriety data science and machine learning platform enable FMCG distributor partners to extend \nworking capital on deferred payment terms to MSME suppliers with limited credit history and \ncollateral by providing a first loss guarantee to these partners and leveraging their FMCG supply-\nchain data to assess credit risk. Limited resources and small-scale operations make MSMEs \nvulnerable  to  climate  shocks,  which  affects  the  health  and  well-being  of  its  owners  and \nemployees. Increased access to financial services, combined with Fairbanc\u2019s tailored products to \nincrease awareness among MSMEs of climate risks, enhances their financial and technical \ncapacity to counteract them and become more climate resilient. Fairbanc\u2019s mission to bridge the \nMSME credit gap in emerging markets aligns with ADB\u2019s operational priorities of achieving greater \nfinancial inclusion and building climate and disaster resilience in Asia and the Pacific.3  \n \n  THE INVESTMENT \n \n  Project Identification and Description \n \n3.  Credit gap. MSMEs are the backbone of the Indonesian economy, contributing about \n61% of gross domestic product and 97% of total employment in 2018.4 Despite the sector\u2019s \nimportance, the total MSME credit gap in Indonesia was estimated at $166 billion in 2017.5 Supply \nchains tend to be highly fragmented, and most MSMEs are very small and family-owned. 6 In \n2018, Indonesia had about 64 million enterprises, of which just over 1% are considered small and \nmedium-sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  and  about  98%  are  considered  microenterprises.  Most \nmicroenterprises are not legally registered and generally do not have access to formal credit. \nLending to SMEs has not been an area of primary focus for the banking segment because of \nreasons such as lack of credit history and collateral. In 2019, MSMEs received only 19.6% of total \nbank lending, while only 39% of SMEs access bank financing. Nonbank financing is slowly \n \n1  Financing partner: Clean Technology Fund, Nordic Development Fund, and the governments of Finland and the \nRepublic of Korea.

MSME Finance Gap.  \n6  Most enterprises in Indonesia are small, usually employing fewer than 20 people. \n ", "2  \nexpanding, but still only accounts for 8% of total financing to MSMEs (footnote 4). Women own \nabout 50% of MSMEs in Indonesia, but experience constraints in accessing funding for their \nbusinesses, including difficulties in meeting loan eligibility criteria because of lack of property \nownership and, in some cases, limited business experience. 7 The unmet financing demand of \nwomen-owned SMEs is estimated at $22 billion (footnote 5). \n \n4.  Climate vulnerability. Indonesia is at high risk of climate-related hazards, including \nfloods, drought, cyclones, and extreme heat. These risks are projected to increase because of \nclimate change, with impacts expected in areas such as agriculture; water, coastal, and marine \nsystems; and related supply chains. MSMEs are highly vulnerable to climate shocks because of \ntheir high exposure to climate hazards and limited adaptive capacity to reduce risk and manage \nresidual risk, as well as supply chain risks. Climate hazards such as droughts and floods often \ndisrupt business, resulting in loss of sales, disrupted supply chain movements, and damage to \npremises. This affects the health and well-being of MSMEs\u2019 owners and employees.8 A barrier to \nMSMEs\u2019 disaster preparedness is that they typically prioritize urgent and immediate short-term \nissues in their business operations. Consequently, they operate with shorter business planning \ncycles than larger companies and have limited access to funding for adaptation. Most MSMEs do \nnot clearly delineate between business and personal finances, so working capital may be diverted \nbecause of sudden large household expenses such as medical emergencies.9 They often use \npersonal savings, loans from family and friends, work more hours, and reduce expenses to cope \nwith these shocks. Such measures have become less effective as the frequency of the disasters \nhas increased.10 Limited access to formal financing such as loans and insurance heightens this \nrisk. Beyond the direct effects of climate change on MSMEs\u2019 operations, their lack of capacity to \ncounteract  these effects  may  also  adversely  impact  on  the  local  communities  they  serve, \ne.g., supply chain disruptions may limit access to basic goods for low-income populations during \ndisasters. Indonesia has limited public sector risk management services in the form of credit, aid, \ninsurance, and adaptation planning support for MSMEs.11 \n \n5.  Fintech and digitization. Indonesia\u2019s rapidly growing fintech industry could allow MSMEs \nto access faster, more convenient, and cost-effective financial services. For example, digital \nbusiness-to-business (B2B) marketplaces work with wholesalers to extend loans to MSMEs along \nthe supply chain. If insufficiently regulated, however, some innovations (e.g., peer-to-peer lending \nproducts) could pose risks to MSME operations, particularly for business owners who have lower \nlevels  of  financial  literacy.12 The  Financial  Services  Authority  (OJK)  of  Indonesia  closely \nscrutinizes  fintech lenders and  promotes  increased digital  financial  literacy,  particularly  for \nwomen, to mitigate risks.13 The increase in account ownership at formal financial institutions for \n \n7  International Finance Corporation. 2016.

Fairbanc aims to enable microcredit to be extended \nthrough fragmented FMCG supply chains to about 4 million MSMEs in Indonesia, which have a \nmarket  size  of  $1.7  billion.  Fairbanc  leverages  the  distribution  network  and  technology \ninfrastructure of large FMCG companies to access the supply chain data of MSMEs digitally. The \ncompany\u2019s proprietary data science and machine learning platform analyzes these data to enable \nefficient assignment of credit to MSMEs that require credit to grow but are less likely to default. \nFairbanc accomplishes this by providing distributor partners a standing credit on its balance sheet, \nenabling these partners to extend working capital on deferred payment terms to MSME suppliers. \nFairbanc currently earns revenue by taking discount received by MSMEs from distributors per \norder as its commission for its data  analytics  and credit management services.  MSMEs\u2019 \nengagement in adaptation and resilience-building will be enhanced by  Fairbanc\u2019s plans  to \nimplement a product recommendation system that will provide information alerts to MSMEs on in-\ndemand products during climate events. By using the early warning system of Indonesia\u2019s \nMeteorology,  Climatology,  and  Geophysics  Agency  (BMKG)  and  conducting  historic  data \nanalysis, Fairbanc will provide a list of in-demand essential goods for MSMEs to stock.15 It will \nalso launch a business continuity program that will help build the capacity of MSMEs to become \nmore resilient during climate events by adopting procedures such as secured storage of assets \n(inventory), emergency lighting, and identifying back-up suppliers. These measures will increase \nMSMEs\u2019  awareness of climate risks and enhance their financial and technical capacity to \ncounteract them and become more climate resilient.  \n \n  Ownership and Management \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n7.

ADB will administer the provision of assistance  of up to $2,000,000, with an initial \ninvestment of up to $500,000 through a quasi-equity investment in Fairbanc Pte. Ltd. \n \n9.  The initial investment will be in the form of a convertible promissory note,. ADB will \ncoinvest about 30% of this financing round and expects to mobilize parallel equity financing of at \nleast $8,000,000 during 2021\u20132024.

ADB is expected to provide support to help strengthen \ngovernance, improve environmental and social sustainability, incorporate measures to support \ngender equality in Fairbanc\u2019s business activities to narrow gender disparities, and strengthen \nawareness  on  climate  and  disaster  risk.  This  investment  complements  ADB\u2019s  sovereign \noperations.16 ADB aims to leverage its networks to help Fairbanc connect with regulators and new \ncustomers, and gain traction in other Asian markets. In line with the ADB Ventures Financing \nPartnership Facility (footnote 2), the share purchase price will be based on a valuation approved \nby the fund investment committee. \n \n  Implementation Arrangements \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n10.  Use of proceeds. Fairbanc will use the investment proceeds to finance its business \ngrowth in Indonesia by expanding its FMCG partnerships and team to improve both technological \nand sales capabilities, including hiring of senior management to accelerate growth, in a gender-\ninclusive manner. Subsequent funding might be used to fund business expansion in other \ndeveloping member countries of ADB. Some 70% of the investment proceeds will be allocated to \ntarget women-owned MSMEs. \n \n11.  Evaluation. Fairbanc will prepare and submit monitoring reports to ADB at least annually. \nThe first report will be submitted no later than 12 months after the first disbursement. \n \n  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n12.  Development of fintech industry in Indonesia. The investment will demonstrate ADB\u2019s \nsupport of innovative financial technologies that strengthen financial inclusion in Indonesia. Micro-\ncredit enables micro-retailers in Indonesia to maintain a larger inventory because of ready access \nto working capital.  \n \n13.  Resource mobilization. ADB\u2019s shareholding is anticipated to have a significant signaling \neffect and is likely to increase market confidence in Fairbanc achieving its business goals. This \nwill help Fairbanc in critical areas, such as launching new products and attracting future debt and \nequity. ADB\u2019s investment will also help catalyze more impact venture investments in Indonesia. \n \n14.  Progress to market-leading standards. As the first and only development finance \ninstitution shareholder, ADB will help develop and support Fairbanc\u2019s adherence to high corporate \ngovernance  and  integrity  standards,  as  well  as  its  adoption  of  market-leading  social  and \nenvironmental standards, with potential demonstration effects in the Indonesian fintech segment. \n \n15.  Gender inclusion. ADB will help Fairbanc implement gender actions to enhance financing \ncapacity toward women owned MSMEs; increase the number of women employees; encourage \nmore balanced women\u2019s participation at senior management and board levels; and develop a \nmore inclusive corporate environment, addressing the issue of sexual harassment.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED \n \n \n16 ADB. 2020.

The investment is aligned with the Government of Indonesia\u2019s commitment to increase \nfinancial inclusion and achieve Sustainable Development Goals 1, 8, and 13.17 The investment\u2019s \nexpected outcome is increased financial inclusion and reduced climate vulnerabilities for MSMEs, \nparticularly those owned by women.18 The expected outputs of the investment are (i) expansion \nof Fairbanc\u2019s business, including climate-resilient products, in a gender-inclusive manner; and (ii) \ngender equality in the workplace enhanced. \n \n  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n17.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The investment is compliant \nwith the fund\u2019s objectives, as set out in the relevant contractual documents. In addition, the \ninvestment will contribute to the following Strategy 2030 operational priorities and their operational \nplans: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities (OP1); (ii) accelerating progress \nin gender equality (OP2); and (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand enhancing environmental sustainability (OP3).19 The investment is also aligned with the \nobjective of the ADB country partnership strategy and country operations business plan for \nIndonesia of addressing climate change, increasing climate resilience, and gender equality.20 \n \n  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \n  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n18.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009) as follows: environment (category C), involuntary resettlement (category C), \nand indigenous peoples (category C).21 \n \n19.  ADB has undertaken due diligence and reviewed the potential environmental and social \nimpacts of the investment. Fairbanc\u2019s business operations and plan for using ADB proceeds is \nlikely to cause minimal adverse impacts to the environment and will not trigger involuntary \nresettlement or indigenous peoples safeguards. \n \n20.  As a digital business, Fairbanc\u2019s operations use electricity as the primary resource and \ngenerate minimal waste outputs. These impacts can be managed through compliance with \nexisting regulations and the adoption of resource conservation measures as part of Fairbanc\u2019s \nenvironmental  and  social  policies  improvement.  Likewise,  Fairbanc  commits  to  adhere  to \napplicable labor laws and internationally recognized core labor standards.

Following ADB\u2019s Policy on Gender and Development (1998), \nFairbanc has incorporated measures to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in \nits business activities.23 Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: increasing the \nnumber of microcredit loans issued to MSMEs owned by women; and increasing women\u2019s \nrepresentation on the board, in senior management, and in new jobs. Fairbanc will also implement \nmeasures to enhance gender equality in the workplace through an explicit anti-sexual harassment \npolicy with supporting procedures, together with training sessions of Fairbanc staff on this topic. \nFairbanc will submit periodic reports on implementation of gender measures to ADB. \n \n  Anticorruption Policy \n \n22.  Fairbanc was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism.
