During the 2001 Country Programming Mission (CPM) of the Asian Development Bank\n(ADB), the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) requested further advisory\ntechnical assistance (TA) for performance-based public finance management. The CPM visited\nFSM from 18 to 31 July 2001 to determine the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements,\nbudget, and detailed terms of reference for the TA.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1, and the\nterms of reference for considerations are in Appendix 2.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. In 1995, the FSM Government initiated its policy reform program aimed at strengthening\nthe economy. ADB, through its Public Sector Reform Program (PSRP) loan2 and associated\nTA,3 has been supporting these reforms. The ADB-financed PSRP succeeded in bringing about\nrequired fiscal adjustments in the national Government and four state governments.4\n3. State governments expressed interest in the performance-based budgeting system. The\nnational Government then requested a follow-on TA to maximize the benefits from the new\nbudgeting approach, such as the establishment of policy linkages, embedding of related modern\nmanagement  concepts,  enhanced  financial  control,  and  effective  reporting  systems  and\nprocedures.\n4. TA 2983 was the second phase of an envisioned six-year TA program for institutional\ncapacity  building  for  effective  and  efficient  public  resource  management.5  The  TA  was  to\ncomplement the formulation of a strategic economic management framework undertaken under\nTA 3024-FSM: Economic Management Policy Advisory Team (EMPAT) II.6 TA 2983 was to\nimprove the management of public resources through development and implementation of a\nperformance-based public resource management system. The achievement under TA 2983\nachieved  the  following:  (i)  performance-based  budgeting  was  introduced  in  the  national\nGovernment and in four state governments; (ii) new budget procedures were introduced; and          \nimprovements  in  accounting  procedures  were  suggested;  (iii)  measures  for  improving\nperformance monitoring were recommended; and (iv) on-site training and international study\ntours were conducted.\n5. TA 3431 commenced in October 2000, and had as its purpose improving the capacity for\nperformance-based public finance management implementation7 in the national Governments\nand four state governments. Extensive formal training8 was carried out in the line departments\nand budget offices in all the governments, and the budget preparation software (BPS) was\nsignificantly  rebuilt  and  updated.  The  activities  under  TA  3431  (i)  provided  training  to\napproximately 400 individuals throughout the five FSM governments, resulting in significant\n                  \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in 22 August 2001.\n2  Loan 1520-FSM: Public Sector Reform Program, for SDR12,979,000, approved on 21 April 1997.\n3  TA 2294-FSM: Policy Advisory Team for Economic Management, for $540,000, approved on 31 January 1995.\n4 An interdepartmental Task Group reviewed the Public Sector Reform Program in FSM in February 1999 and\nconfirmed that it had achieved successful fiscal adjustments. See Knapman, Bruce and Saldanha, Cedric, Reforms\nin the Pacific, 1999 Pacific Studies Series, No. 17.\n5 TA 2983-FSM: Performance-Based Public Resource Management, for $988,000, approved on 26 January 1998.\n6 TA 3024-FSM: Economic Policy Reform and Management, for $2,877,000, approved on 2 June 1998.\n7 TA 3431-FSM: Improving Capacity for Performance-Based Public Finance Management Implementation, for\n$500,000, was approved in April 2000.\n8 The training was conducted for administrative officers, and middle and senior management, the primary objective\nbeing to build capacity in basic strategic planning, quantifying targets, and costing outputs and activities.", "2\nimprovement in levels of understanding of performance-based budgeting concepts and terms9;\n(ii)  provided  technical  assistance  in  strategic  planning  to  90%  of  all  national  and  state\ngovernment  departments;  (iii)  helped  the  five  governments  identify  costs  associated  with\nperformance  items;  (v)  significantly  improved  the  BPS  system  by  enhancing  software\nfunctionality;  (vi)  created  and  delivered  a  budget  manual  with  step-by-step  instructions  for\ndeveloping a performance budget; (vii) conducted a partnership workshop for senior officials;\nand (viii) drafted quarterly performance report formats for Yap and Pohnpei States. The TA was\ncompleted  in  August  2001.  Lessons  learned  during  implementation  of  this  TA  include  the\nfollowing:\n(i)  The introduction of performance-based budget management in FSM was (a)\nrecognized as an important and increasingly accepted step in improving public\nsector  planning  and  accountability  in  public  finances,  and  (b)  realistically\nexpected  to  take  several  iterations  before  it  would  be  fully  developed  and\ninstitutionalized.  Several  years  will  be  needed  to  effectively  introduce  a\nperformance-based  budget  system  through  progressive  understanding  and\nimprovements.\n(ii)  There is a need for a sustained effort to gain the extended support of key\ngovernment officials and acceptance by all FSM governments. By making the\nnecessary  technical  improvements  in  the  budget  and  financial  management\ncomputer  software,  many  of  the  major  constraints  to  institutionalizing\nperformance management will have been overcome.\n(iii)  Training  in  the  concepts  and  operations  of  performance  budgeting  and\nmanagement is an ongoing continuously needed process. Every attempt should\nbe  made  to  institutionalize  course  offerings  in  strategic  planning  and\nmanagement,  performance  budget  preparation,  and  monitoring  and  reporting\nthrough  the  College  of  Micronesia.  The  approach  will  increase  internal\nunderstanding  and  support  for  performance  management,  and  lead  to  a\ndecrease in the need for externally hired management trainers.\n(iv)  Proper sequencing of TA activities and inputs is necessary to maximize impact.\n6. The CPM was informed by a number of national and state government officials of FSM\u2019s\nsupport and commitment to the performance-based budget management system. Having raised\nthe capacity of many mid- and senior level public servants in TA 3431, the leaders of the\nrespective governments have indicated their readiness to incorporate its concepts and tools into\nthe management culture of government.\n7. The very decentralized and complex system of government in FSM has meant that ADB\nassistance through the strategic application of performance budgeting cannot be done simply by\ninstalling  it  at  the  national  government  level;  rather  it  needs  to  be  done  uniquely  on  a\ngovernment-by-government basis. While TA 2538,10 TA 2938, and TA 3431 have put in place\nfoundations for performance-based public finance management, there still remain a number of\nimportant  technical  and  behavioral  aspects  required  to  complete  the  installation  and\ninstitutionalization of performance-based public finance management. The financial management\n                  \n9 This conclusion was based on pre-and post-training tests conducted during TA 3431-FSM.\n10 TA 2538-FSM: Improved Budget Management, for $480,000, approved on 14 March 1996.", "3\ninformation  systems  (FMISs)11  need  to  be  properly  programmed  and  operated  to  provide\naccurate, timely revenue and expenditure data, and to interface with BPS. The BPS must be\nfurther enhanced so that it can interface with FMIS to import fiscal data or export budget data, and\nprovide a range of financial and economic reports for use as a management tool (paras. 10, 11).\nIn budget planning, the fundamental linkages between establishing performance targets and the\nbudgeting process need to be enhanced. While FSM economic summit meetings on the national\neconomy have provided the necessary policy framework, there continues to be a need to\nintroduce  systematic  linkages  between  these  policies  and  objectives  in  the  respective\ngovernments\u2019 annual budgets.\n8. Also,  while  the  ultimate  objective  of  introducing  performance-based  public  finance\nmanagement  is  to  improve  the  quality  and  effectiveness  of  resource  management,  the\nperformance-based budgeting system and supporting software is still being used primarily for\nbudgeting. A fundamental next step is to use the system for management purposes, which\nrequires a demonstrated commitment by the leadership in each of the governments.\n9. In the deliberations on the FY2002 budget in the FSM National Congress, the new\nbudgeting  approach  was  extensively  discussed.  Although  the  report  indicated  continued\nfrustration with the process and product, an overall commitment to the concept and the need for\nthe performance-based budget management system was reaffirmed. Congress has indicated\nthat the financial management legislative framework drafted in 1999 will be considered for\nadoption when the overall systems and procedures associated with performance budgeting and\nmanagement have taken hold and are operationalized, and its practical use in the management\nof government is demonstrated.  Adoption of the legislative framework is not viewed as a\nnecessary prerequisite to institutionalization in the public sector.\n10. The  budget  preparation  system  now  includes  functions  such  as  (i)  standardized\nbudgeting process in all five governments; (ii) linked performance-based budget and line-item\nbudget modules; (iii) ability to enter performance-based budget inputs, outputs, and unit costs;\n(iv)  enhanced  ability  to  handle  changes  in  organizational  structures;  (v)  ability  to  handle\nsupplementary  budget  submissions;  (vi)  expanded  reporting  capabilities;  and  (vii)  a  Users\nManual. The new BPS maintains the look and feel of the original BPS program that people were\nfamiliar with.  With these considerable improvements, the BPS is a well-developed, useful\nbudget preparation software, understood and used in all five governments. The BPS needs\nfurther development, however, including further revenue information, categories for economic\nand fiscal analysis, the ability to track and report on results, and the ability to interface with the\nrespective FMIS in each of the governments.\n11. The effectiveness and relevance of the BPS depends in large part on its capability to\ninterface with the existing financial management information systems (FMIS). Each system\nneeds  to  access  data  to  integrate  and  produce  reports  that  can  accurately   \ntrack expenditures and performance, compare revenues with expenditures, and provide on-\ndemand, accurate \u2018real time\u2019 budgetary information.\n12. The TA primarily addresses good governance issues in FSM and is expected to have\nsignificant  effects  on  resource  management  and  allocation,  as  well  as  on  the  level  of\ntransparency in public financial management. The ensuing efficiency gains will contribute to\n                  \n11 There are three FMIS currently used in the FSM: National, Chuuk, and Kosrae use FOCUS; Pohnpei uses DILOG;\nYap uses American Fundware.", "4\npoverty  alleviation  through  greater  specificity  of  inputs  and  outputs,  and  accountability  for\nprogram delivery.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n13. To  keep  up  the  momentum  in  implementing  performance-based  public  finance\nmanagement systems, this TA aims to (i) audit and analyze current systems and procedures\nrelated to financial accounting and reporting, to address the respective deficiencies in and\nbetween FMIS and BPS; (ii) improve the technical systems to ensure proper monitoring; and (iii)\ndevelop  performance  budget  management  capability.  While  it  must  be  acknowledged  that\ncapacity building and further skills development are not linear in nature but require repeated,\ncontinuous effort and support, the accomplishment of the stated objectives will provide the\nnecessary  underpinnings  for  a  continuous,  self-sustaining  performance  management  and\nbudgeting system and process in the FSM, and reduce significantly the need for additional TA\nsupport. The TA will assist the governments of the FSM in strengthening the implementation of\nperformance-based public finance management and putting it on a self-sustaining basis. The TA\nwill strive to build upon and achieve an acceptable level of support and self-sustainability for the\nperformance-based budgeting system now in its fourth year of implementation at the national\nGovernment and in each of the four state governments.\nB.  Scope\n14. The TA will finance the provision of consulting services and training activities. It will\ncomprise the following components (i) audit and analysis of the systems and procedures, (ii)\nimproving the budget software, (iii) implementing the integration of the budget software and\nfinancial  management  systems,  (iv)  human  resources  development,  and  (v)  performance\nmanagement to derive full benefits from performance-based public finance management. The\nfive separate components of the TA need to be carried out in the proper sequence: step one\nmust be completed in order to determine the applicability of the other steps. Steps two and three\nmay  be  done  in  sequence  or  concurrently,  while  steps  four  and  five  should  preferably\ncommence after some initial work has taken place under steps two and three.\n15. The continuing focus of the TA activities will be on the transfer of knowledge to relevant\nlocal staff and the development of the internal institutional training capability at the College of\nMicronesia, to enable them to handle on their own all crucial aspects related to performance-\nbased public finance management.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The TA is estimated to cost $465,000, including foreign exchange costs of $340,000 and\n$125,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Government has requested ADB to finance on\na grant basis $350,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $10,000\nequivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will contribute $115,000 equivalent for\noffice space, counterpart staff, local transportation, interstate travel of seminar participants, and\nother services. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3.", "5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n17. The Department of Finance and Administration (DOFA) will be the Executing Agency.\nThe Budget Office director of the national Government, assisted by the EMPAT public sector\nmanagement advisor, will be in charge of TA implementation and everyday supervision of the\nconsultants.  The  Steering  Committee  will  consist  of  an  individual  from  the  Office  of  the\nPresident, the Deputy Secretary of Economic Affairs, and the Deputy Secretary of Finance and\nAdministration.\n18. ADB  will  engage  a  team  of  international  individual  consultants,  and  will  provide\napproximately 16 person-months of consulting services: (i) audit/analysis of current financial\nmanagement and reporting systems (2 person-months), (ii) improvements made in the BPS\nsoftware (2 person-months), (iii) integration of BPS and FMIS in each government (3 person-\nmonths),  (iv) formal and informal training to selected individuals and groups identified in (i)\nabove  (5  person-months),  and  (v)  activation  of  performance  management  systems  and\nprocedures (4 person-months). The consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The consultants will collaborate closely with\nthe ADB-financed EMPAT II and any other ongoing ADB financed and other externally-assisted\nprojects related to reforms of public enterprises, to achieve maximum utilization of resources\nand avoid duplication of effort.\n19. The TA will be implemented over a period of two years, commencing January 2002 and\nto be completed no later than January 2004. Each consultant will prepare a brief progress report\nmonthly  setting  out  actual  achievement  against  the  terms  of  reference  and  other  agreed\nbenchmarks. A draft final report by each consultant will be signed off by DOFA and ADB before\nthe final payment is issued for the consulting services.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n20. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Federated States\nof Micronesia, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000, for the purpose of\nImplementation of Performance-Based Budget Management, and hereby reports such action to\nthe Board.", "6  Appendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nPerformance Monitoring Assumptions\nDesign Summary\nIndicators/Targets Mechanisms and Risks\nGoal\n\u2022 Measurable improvements Economic performance\nImproved management\nin government service reports, budget and\nof public resources\ndelivery legislative documents\nthrough more\n\u2022 More efficient utilization of\ntransparent and\ngovernment\u2019s financial,\naccountable public\nmaterial, and human\nsector operations\nresources\nObjective/Purpose\nFull-fledged operation\n\u2022 Use of performance- Assessment of Executive leadership gives\nand use of performance\nbased targets in the government budget- full operational\nbudgeting and\nbudget preparation, related documents and commitment to improving\nmanagement in all 5\nreview, and decision timeliness of preparation management and\nFSM Governments by\nmaking process in all five budgeting of government\nFY04\ngovernments by June Consultant reports, On- resources through\n2002 site observations, establishing, tracking, and\nfeedback from measuring output\n\u2022  A fully operational budget Government, the public at performance\nsoftware installed and large, and aid providers\nbeing used in all 5 FSM\ngovernments by June\n2002\n\u2022  A financial reporting\nsystem regularly\nproducing up-to-date,\naccurate expenditure and\noutput data by 12/02\n\u2022  Actual use and\napplication of\nperformance\nmanagement procedures\nby the senior\nmanagement of all five\ngovernments by 9/02\n\u2022  A transparent, structured\ndecision-making process\nin allocation of capital and\noperational budgets of\ngovernment by FY04\n\u2022  More cost-efficient,     \ntransparent management\nand budgeting system\nbeing used in all 5 FSM\ngovernments by FY04\n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 1)", "7 Appendix 1, page 2\nPerformance Monitoring Assumptions\nDesign Summary\nIndicators/Targets Mechanisms and Risks\nOutputs\n1.
