INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) responds to the requests of Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs) to strengthen their institutional \ncapacity for  property tax1 management,  including  property registration  institutions,  property \nvaluation methodology, and local tax administration, to improve subnational service delivery. This \nwill contribute to the localization and achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \nand their targets, particularly SDG 16.3 on the legal framework to ensure property rights, 16.10 \non public access to information, and 17.1 on domestic resource mobilization (DRM).2 The TA \nteam will support DMCs in enhancing property registration and valuation through (i) diagnostic \nstudies, and policy and administrative recommendations; (ii) knowledge tools on property tax \nmanagement; and (iii) capacity building for local tax policy and administration. \n \n2.  The TA supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 4 on making cities \nmore  livable,  and  Strategy  2030  Operational  Plan  for  Priority  6  (OP6)  on  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity.3 These operational priorities highlight the importance of \nDRM in strengthening governance and institutional capacity in DMCs, especially the use of \nproperty tax to support the financial sustainability of municipalities directly and indirectly by \nleveraging other finances. The TA builds on the lessons from an ongoing subproject4 on enhanced \nrevenue performance of recurrent property taxes in Southeast Asia, funded by the Domestic \nResource Mobilization Trust Fund, and other relevant projects.5 The TA team will initially conduct \nthe diagnostic studies in Cambodia and Nepal, and expand its coverage for capacity-building \nactivities to other DMCs, which may be interested in or are implementing property tax reforms. \nThe TA will be coordinated with the Digital Technology for Development Unit of ADB\u2019s Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department (SDCC) and operations departments to enhance \ndigital solutions under the transformative agenda of OP6. It is included in the 2020 Management-\napproved results-based work plan of SDCC.6 \n \n \n1  Property tax generally provides an important revenue source to subnational governments, whether levied nationally \nor subnationally depending on the country. For example, in Cambodia, recurrent taxes on immovable property are \nlevied nationally and the revenue is allocated to the subnational government. On the other hand, in the Philippines \nand Thailand, recurrent taxes on immovable property are levied subnationally. \n2  United Nations General Assembly. 2015.

Manila. \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 May 2020. \n ", "2 \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Property taxation, if well designed, is regarded as one of the best forms of taxation for \ncontributing to social equity because of its progressive nature. It is also potentially more neutral \nthan other types of taxes because it has a smaller negative impact on the economic decisions of \ntaxpayers. From an administrative perspective, property tax is also advantageous because it is \ndifficult to avoid given the high visibility and immobility of land and buildings. Property tax can help \nDMCs raise a more stable and predictable revenue stream. For example, in economies covered \nby the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the ratio of the revenue from \nrecurrent taxes on immovable property to gross domestic product in 2017 reached up to 2.8% in \nFrance and 3.1% in the United Kingdom, while in DMCs such as Cambodia, Indonesia, the \nPhilippines, and Thailand, the revenue from recurrent taxes on immovable property yields only \n0.10%\u20130.38% of gross domestic product.7 These statistics suggest ample room for DMCs to \nexpand the revenue from recurrent taxes on immovable property. In view of this, an effective \nproperty tax management can help enhance DRM, thereby contributing to OP6. \n \n4.  Moreover, property tax is often considered an appropriate tax to provide subnational \ngovernments  with  meaningful  revenue  autonomy  in  fiscally  decentralized  systems,  and  an \nimportant revenue source to improve local service delivery and finance smaller infrastructure \nprojects that reflect community requirements.8 Hence, property tax can be a catalyst of local \nautonomy. Operational Plan for Priority 4 underlines the importance of property tax in mobilizing \nlocal funding for urban infrastructure and services, containing local debt buildup, and ensuring a \nmore stable and, eventually, sustainable revenue base. It asserts that a more robust property tax \nmanagement will help cities maximize their internal financial resources to support improvements \nin the outreach and quality of service delivery. \n \n5.  The revenue performance of property taxes not only remains low in DMCs but is further \naggravated by Asia\u2019s rapid urbanization, which drives up residential property prices dramatically \nand will result in an increasing disparity between the actual market value of property and the \nassessed value captured under current property tax systems. This distorts revenue collection, \nwhich is already hampered by political capture, low-level fiscal decentralization, institutional \nconstraints, weak enforcement, and taxpayers\u2019 attitude to tax compliance. In combination, these \nfactors  constrain  the  stability  and  predictability  of  revenues  for  national  and  subnational \ngovernments. \n \n6.  Improving property tax management will also significantly impact the aspirations of many \nDMCs in Asia and the Pacific to honor the global commitments contained in the 2030 targets of \nthe SDGs, particularly SDG 16.3 on a legal framework to ensure property rights, 16.10 on public \naccess to information, and 17.1 on DRM (footnote 2). SDG localization\u2014described as the process \nof defining, implementing, and monitoring strategies locally to achieve global, national, and \nsubnational SDGs\u2014is required to accelerate the implementation of the SDGs and sustain it \nbeyond 2030. It can be a key driver in addressing the critical challenges faced by countries and \ncommunities in Asia and the Pacific, which include rapid urbanization, growing inequalities, and \nthe impact of climate change and disasters. About 65% of the 169 targets underlying the 17 SDGs \nwill not be reached without proper engagement of and coordination with subnational governments. \nIncreasing the responsibilities of subnational governments for monitoring and taking on the \nnecessary functions to ensure effective SDG localization requires adequate financial capacities. \n \n7  Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2019.

Massachusetts: Harvard \nKennedy School and Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government. \n ", "3 \nIn this context, property tax is expected to play a key role in enhancing DRM and building the \ninstitutional capacity of subnational governments, thus supporting the achievement of other \nobjectives. \n \n7.  The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is putting pressure on people, businesses, \nand governments around the world. Its potential economic impact in Asia and the Pacific is \nestimated at $1.7 trillion under a 3-month containment scenario, and $2.5 trillion under a 6-month \ncontainment scenario, with the region accounting for 30% of the overall decline in global output.9 \nSince DRM is essential for DMCs to underpin their financial resources during or after the recovery, \na wide variety of DMC interventions, including property tax management, could be prioritized. \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s value addition. Recognizing DMCs\u2019 strong demand for improving property tax \npolicy and administration, ADB has implemented several TA projects and subprojects to help \nimprove the institutional capacity for property tax management (footnotes 4 and 5). Key lessons \nfrom these show that building effective property tax systems hinges on overcoming challenges \nsuch as (i) weak capacity of property registration institutions, (ii) inefficient property valuation \nmethodology,  and  (iii)  increased  capacity  constraints  in  local  tax  administration.10 These \nchallenges11 can be mastered by (i) strengthening the legal and regulatory frameworks for \nproperty registration with institutional and administrative capacities, and database and analysis; \n(ii) identifying and designing a feasible property valuation mechanism with regular updates to \noptimize  market  value;  (iii)  designing  holistic  approaches  to  improve  the  coordination  and \ndata/information-sharing systems among relevant government agencies to ensure smooth data \nflow for effective property registration and valuation; and (iv) strengthening the technical skills and \nenforcement powers of government officials involved in property taxation. This TA will endeavor \nto address most, if not all, of these challenges by strengthening property tax policies and \nadministration, facilitating peer-to-peer learning, and sharing innovative practices in DMCs and \nglobally. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: sustainable subnational service delivery \nstrengthened (footnote 3). The TA will have the following outcome: institutional capacity for \nproperty tax management in selected DMCs improved.12 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Knowledge of property tax management improved. The TA team will \nundertake  studies  to  be  used  as  diagnostic  tools  and  provide  policy  and  administrative \nrecommendations to assess and help enhance (i) a legal and regulatory framework for property \nregistration systems; (ii) operations of property registration institutions through improvements in \nthe quality of cadastre or parcel maps, promotion of systematic property registration, up-to-date \nfiscal cadastre records, and development of cadastral and land information systems; (iii) property \n \n9  C.

Manila. \n11 In addition to these challenges, constraints arise if the tax base is narrowed by too many exemptions or the tax \nadministration is overly complex and costly, if the tax rate is too low, or if access to transaction data is poor. \n12 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "4 \nvaluation systems that reflect actual market values, or alternative systems13 such as point-based \nvaluation;14 (iv) capacity-building activities and human resource management for subnational \ngovernment officials involved in property tax administration; and (v) coordination mechanisms \nbetween the government agencies concerned.15 The TA team will also demonstrate the revenue \npotential derived from property tax management reforms, to the extent possible, to encourage \ngovernments  to  support  such  reforms.  The  team  identified  Cambodia16 and  Nepal  for  the \ndiagnostic studies.17 Drawing on the results of the diagnostic studies, the TA will support the \ndevelopment of a property tax management tool kit, with the objective of guiding policymakers \nand property tax administrators in adopting ways to improve property tax management. The tool \nkit will highlight property registration and valuation policies, systems, and processes, including \ntechnical aspects of the valuation methodology, and cover other tax-specific issues and existing \nconstraints on property tax policy and administration, building on international good practice. It \nwill  also  feature  case  studies  from  other  DMCs  which  have  implemented  property  tax \nmanagement reforms. It will be published and shared as good practice among DMCs. \n \n11.  Output 2: Capacity building on property tax management delivered. Building on \ncountry experiences under output 1, the TA team will conduct at least two regional capacity-\nbuilding workshops for government officials involved in property taxation. These workshops will \ncover a wide range of topics on property tax management, including case studies of successful \nproperty tax reforms and how to address specific issues on and constraints to tax policy and \nadministration, and will facilitate peer-to-peer learning, including knowledge-sharing between \nsubnational governments and cooperation between developing countries through the regional \nplatform for sharing best practices and addressing emerging challenges in the region. The officials \nattending  the  regional  workshops  will  be  selected  from  DMCs  that  are  interested  in  or \nimplementing property tax reforms, and will include national and subnational officials. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are in Appendix 2. \n \n13 ADB. 2013. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan \nand Grant to the Kingdom of Bhutan for Strengthening Economic Management Program. Manila. ADB supported the \nGovernment of Bhutan in introducing a new property valuation methodology. Under that methodology, land valuation \nis conducted with area-based valuation rates that are primarily determined by taking into consideration factors like \nmarket situations, financial institution rates, and official land transaction records. Factors such as distance from \nhighways, water availability, and land use are also considered for adjustment. The new land valuation methodology \ncan be classified as a combination of area-based and market-value assessments, and its rationale is to strike the \nbalance between administrative feasibility and proper reflection of the ability-to-pay principle. The adoption of the \ncombination approach and the factors for adjustment will be considered in this TA. \n14 K. Grieco et al. 2019.

Brighton, United Kingdom: International Centre for Tax and Development. \n15 In some countries, disputes over the rights of land users between two or more parties in a land relationship, or \ndisputes related to the boundaries, result in hindering property tax administration. Output 1 will cover the prevention \nof disputes and the improvement of dispute resolution mechanisms. \n16 Under the ongoing Domestic Resource Mobilization Trust Fund subproject on enhanced revenue performance of \nrecurrent property taxes (footnote 4), the reform measures in the context of Cambodia are identified in the \nforthcoming final report (footnote 11). These include (i) gaining better access to property information for tax \nadministrations, (ii) conducting periodic surveys by trained property assessors to increase the amount of properties \nregistered in the tax system, and (iii) updating the property values in the tax roll. The TA will help with the issues \nrelevant to this reform plan and provide concrete solutions in its implementation. \n17 Given that institutional and capacity constraints at the subnational level are deeper than at the national level, two \ndiagnostic studies will be targeted initially under this TA with the idea of replicating the learnings later in other \ncountries. Diagnostic studies in the selected DMCs will start after receipt of government concurrence. \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. The Governance Thematic Group of SDCC will select, \nsupervise, and evaluate consultants; organize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource \npersons in the workshops. The TA will be coordinated with other TA projects engaged in \ndeveloping cadastres and land management systems with the use of digital technology and \nDomestic Resource Mobilization Trust Fund initiatives to maximize the potential benefits that \nDMCs can gain with respect to DRM. \n \n14.
