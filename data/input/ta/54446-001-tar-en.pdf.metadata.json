THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TRTA) is for the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to design, setup, and operationalize the ADB Ventures Investment Fund 2 (Fund 2) under \nthe ADB Ventures Financing Partnerships Facility (ADB Ventures). Approved by the Board on the \n31 January 2020 for an indicative funding target exceeding $200 million, ADB Ventures supports \nand invests in early-stage technology companies that contribute to achieving the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) in emerging Asia-Pacific.1,2 ADB Ventures currently houses the ADB \nVentures Investment Fund 1 (Fund 1) and the ADB Ventures technical assistance (the TA). \nFund 1 reached final close on 24 September 2020 at $60 million capitalization and provides equity \nfinancing up to $4 million per investment.3 The TA is being implemented during 2020-2022 to \nleverage  ADB\u2019s  extensive  operational  network  to  generate  investment  pipeline.  As  of \n15 November 2020, the TA was funded at about $7.6 million.4 \n \n2.  ADB  Ventures  fills  an  operational  gap  allowing  ADB\u2019s  Private  Sector  Operations \nDepartment to provide funding at all stages of the business life cycle of early-stage technology \ncompanies. Fund 2 will complement Fund 1 by providing debt financing indicatively up to \n$8 million  to  technology  companies  transitioning  from  equity-financed  to  leveraged  growth. \nFund 2 will indicatively focus on cleantech and agriculture technology companies which are \ntypically more capital-intensive. Debt financing is often needed to help these companies deploy \ntheir product solutions at scale to accelerate commercialization and SDG impact. \n     \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Challenge: The Asia-Pacific has made great strides in poverty reduction and economic \ngrowth, but is not on track to achieve any of the 17 SDGs by 2030.5 In particular the region needs \nto  significantly  accelerate  its  progress  on  environmental  sustainability.6  The  outbreak  of \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) has further stalled progress. Falling fiscal revenues and higher \npublic spending to strengthen public healthcare systems and mitigate the economic impact of \nCOVID-19 will constrain public sector resources available for much-needed green and social \ninvestments.  ADB  developing  member  countries  (DMC)  will  need  to  unlock  private  sector \nresources to finance a green and inclusive recovery in emerging Asia-Pacific.7 \n \n4.  Opportunity:  The  plummeting  cost  of  technology  is  creating  opportunities  to \ncommercialize technology solutions that solve big development problems in the region.8,9 These \n \n1  ADB. 2020. Establishment of the ADB Ventures Financing Partnership Facility. \n2  Target investees are companies with technology-enabled business models operating in ADB DMCs. \n3  Fund 1 investors include the Ministry for Foreign Affairs Finland, the Clean Technology Fund, the Korea Venture \nInvestment Corporation, the Nordic Development Fund, and the Ministry of Economy and Finance Republic of Korea.  \n4  Including funding from TASF ($2 million), the Clean Technology Fund ($3 million), the Asia Climate Finance Fund \n($1.4 million) and Nordic Development Fund (Euro 1 million). ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department has \nearmarked $2 million TASF from the 2021 budget, and $1 million in 2022. Fundraising for a balance of $1.4 million \nis ongoing to reach the total TA target of $ 12 million. \n5  United Nations Economic and Social Commission for the Asia and the Pacific. 2020. Asia and the Pacific SDG \nProgress Report 2020.  \n6  Top SDG priorities in the Asia-Pacific include responsible consumption and production, and climate action.  \n7  ADB. Forthcoming. Asian Development Outlook 2021: Financing a Green and Inclusive Recovery. \n8  PricewaterhouseCoopers. 2020. The State of Climate Tech 2020: The next frontier for venture capital. \n9  For example, the average price for battery packs has fallen by 87% in real terms to $156 per kilowatt hour during \n2010-2019 (see Bloomberg New Energy Finance 2019 Battery Price Survey). \n ", "2   \n \ninclude inefficient energy consumption that is generating unsustainable levels of greenhouse gas \nemissions, climate-related hazards and disasters triggered by natural hazards, poor air quality \nand waste management in cities, and the adverse impact of human activities on marine and \ncoastal ecosystems. \n \n5.  Problem: Many of the technology solutions needed to tackle these problems already exist \nbut have not yet been deployed and/or commercialized at scale in emerging Asia-Pacific. Since \n2015, venture capital (VC) portfolios have tended to be concentrated in developed economies, \nlater-stage deals, and software technologies such as e-commerce. VC funding has been more \nlimited to some sectors highly relevant to the SDGs. From 2016-2019, only 2% and 1% of VC \ndeals in the Asia-Pacific were for cleantech and agricultural technology, respectively.10 The path \ntoward technology commercialization is typically longer for this category of technology solutions. \nThe payback period is likely to be even more uncertain for hardware and/or hard science \ntechnology solutions that tend to be more capital intensive. These factors alter the risk-return \nprofile of these technologies making them less attractive to venture capital investors.11 Beyond \nproduct development, entrepreneurs venturing into emerging Asia-Pacific markets will likely need \nto navigate at least one of the following significant hurdles:12  \n \ni.  Market validation. Markets in emerging Asia-Pacific are diverse and fragmented \nby  language,  geography,  culture,  and  business  enabling  environment. \nTechnologies and business models must be adapted market-by-market to a variety \nof  norms,  often  amid  limited  market  information  and  low  transparency.  User \ndemand for technology solutions is rarely articulated in a way that attracts interest \nfrom technology providers. It can be expensive and time-consuming to get buy-in \nfrom incumbents with long and risk-adverse development cycles. Market entry \ntransaction costs are even more acute in the Asia-Pacific\u2019s smaller and more \nremote  markets.  The  private  sector  has  proven  reluctant  to  invest  there,  as \ntechnology innovators often consider it easier to focus on larger and more mature \nmarkets. Those that decide to venture into developing Asia-Pacific often face \nheightened market risks including opaque legal and regulatory frameworks. \n \nii.  Scaling deployment. Climate impact technology businesses in the scale-up stage \n(i.e. post product development and validation) often require a significant amount of \nup-front capital expenditure. While potentially offering solid long-term paybacks, the \ngrowth  trajectory  of  these  companies  tends  to  be  relatively  slow  so  raising \nadditional\u2014and often large amounts of\u2014capital through additional VC funding is \noften not an option. Debt financing options are also limited as traditional debt \nproviders generally prefer to lend to companies with established and stable cash \nflows.  Technology  companies  transitioning  from  equity-financed  to  leveraged \ngrowth may be at or near positive unit economics, but still perceived by traditional \nlenders to be too risky due to their limited operational track record and inability to \noffer sufficient physical assets as collateral. The lack of affordable debt is therefore \npreventing these technologies reaching emerging markets at scale. \n \n6.  Nascent VC markets in emerging Asia-Pacific. Although there is a growing pool of \npatient capital from diversified sources \u2013 including corporate VC funds, foundations, and family \n \n10 Pitchbook Database (accessed 31 October 2020). \n11 Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 2016. Venture Capital and Cleantech: The Wrong Model for Clean Energy \nInnovation. \n12 Rocky Mountain Institute. 2020. Climate Tech\u2019s Four Valleys of Death and Why We Must Build a Bridge. \n ", "  3 \n \noffices  \u2013  venture-stage  financing,  particularly  venture-stage  debt  financing,  to  support \nentrepreneurs overcome these hurdles remains limited in emerging Asia-Pacific. These funding \nsources remain fragmented and struggle to understand complexities across emerging Asia-\nPacific markets. In developed economies the venture-stage debt market has evolved as a \nfinancing category to help technology companies transitioning from equity-driven to leveraged \ngrowth. This market is however still nascent in the Asia-Pacific. There are also rich opportunities \nfor advancing gender equality given that women-led enterprises attracted less than 3% of global \nventure capital funding.13 \n \n7.  Strategy 2030 priorities. ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 emphasizes the importance of innovative \ntechnologies in addressing development challenges in emerging Asia-Pacific. Strategy 2030 \nOperational Plans prioritize scaling up ADB\u2019s support to addressing climate change, building \nclimate resilience, ensuring environmental sustainability, tackling the water-food-energy nexus, \nand  accelerating  gender  equality. 14  Strategy  2030  also  commits  to  expanding  ADB\u2019s \nnonsovereign operations in frontier markets by considering smaller deal sizes with potentially \nhigher risk and development impact.   \n \n8.  Important  pilot  initiative.  ADB  Ventures  is  an  important  pilot  initiative  that  has \nimplications for future funds as well as ADB\u2019s core operations and future business process \nreforms. Key lessons so far include: (i) the understanding that there will be significant learnings \nfrom both the successes and failures of investing in early-stage technology companies; ADB can \ncapture these learnings to better advise and serve traditional clients; (ii) ADB is taking a portfolio \napproach for a small, ringfenced set of investments which allows for higher risk and greater \ndevelopmental impact at the project level; if successful, this approach could eventually be \nintegrated into ADB\u2019s mainstream nonsovereign operations; (iii) ADB Ventures is testing the \napproach of involving external investment experts in ADB\u2019s investment decision making process \nwithout compromising ADB safeguard polices and integrity procedures; and, (iv) TA resources \ncan be used to leverage ADB\u2019s operational networks, relationships, and strategic partnerships to \ngenerate bankable early-stage projects and crowd in risk capital towards achieving the SDGs.15,16  \n \nB.  Outcome and Outputs \n \n9.  Impact and outcome. Fund 2 will enable ADB Ventures to generate greater impact by \nfurther catalyzing venture-risk-capital funding towards achievement of the SDGs in the Asia-\nPacific. The outcome will be operationalization of Fund 2 (Linked Document 1). Along with Fund \n1 and the TA, the suite of ADB Ventures financing modalities will allow ADB to provide funding \nacross multiple stages of the business life cycle of technology companies. Fund 1 and the TA will \nhelp early-stage companies validate their technology solutions in emerging Asia-Pacific markets. \nFund 2 will support technology companies transitioning from equity-driven to leveraged growth. \nADB Ventures will encourage cross-border market expansion of technology providers to ADB\u2019s \nDMCs through network partnerships in both developed and developing economies (para. 17). \n \n10.  ADB Ventures Investment Fund 2. The design of ADB Ventures Investment Fund 2 will \nbe informed by TRTA outputs detailed in para 14 and build on the lessons from past and on-going \nADB Ventures operations (para. 8). Fund 2 will aim to crowd in commercial risk capital for a \n \n13 International Finance Corporation. 2019. Moving Towards Gender Balance in Private Equity and Venture Capital. \n14 ADB. 2019.

ADB is currently seeking funding commitments \nof at least $100 million to establish and operationalize Fund 2.17 Fund 2 will provide debt financing \nindicatively up to $8 million per transaction to technology companies (indicatively Series B stage \nand beyond).18,19  Fund 2 will seek to coinvest with and therefore catalyze commercial venture risk \ncapital. Fund 2\u2019s target projects are envisaged as companies that: (i) emerge from ADB Ventures \ninvestment and TA activities, as well as other relevant ADB operations; (ii) are cofinanced with \ncommercial investors (including VCs, corporates, and financial institutions); and (iii) benefit from \nADB\u2019s technical additionality (para 13). Aligned to Fund 1 operations, Fund 2 will primarily target \nSoutheast Asia and South Asia. The structure and commercial terms of Fund 2 will be determined \nby diagnostics under this TRTA (output 1). Approval for the establishment and administration of \nFund 2 will be sought separately once fund-raising discussions have resulted in the necessary \ncommitments by third-party funders. ADB will aim for Fund 2 to become operational by 31 \nDecember 2021. \n \n11.  Climate  Impact.  Fund 2  will  apply  a  climate  impact  investing  lens to  evaluate the \ncompany\u2019s contribution to climate impact, including: (i) climate mitigation \u2013 reduction or prevention \nof greenhouse gas emissions, (ii) climate adaptation \u2013 prevention or reduction in the adverse \nimpact of climate change, and (iii) climate resilience \u2013 increasing the ability and capacity to \nrecover from the adverse impacts of climate change.   \n \n12.  Gender Impact. Fund 2 will apply a gender equality scorecard to evaluate the company\u2019s \ngender inclusiveness on six dimensions: suppliers, customers, ownership, leadership, workers, \nand institutional practices.    \n \n13.  ADB additionality. Fund 2 operations will benefit from ADB\u2019s unique convening power, \nexpertise,  and  resources  to  crowd  technology  and  investment  into  emerging  markets. \nNonfinancial additionality includes (i) risk mitigation, by being an honest broker to convene and \nleverage ADB\u2019s expansive regional networks and both sovereign and non-sovereign relationships; \n(ii) standard setting, by encouraging improved standards of environmental and social safeguards, \ncorporate  governance,  and  impact  monitoring  early-stage  companies  grow  and  scale;  and \n(iii) knowledge, innovation, and capacity-building, by encouraging global and regional technology \ntransfers through operating at scale and sustaining long-term strategic partnership engagements \nacross  ADB\u2019s  DMCs.  Financial  additionality  includes  (i)  an  innovative  financing  structure, \nincluding the provision of patient capital and debt financing that is not readily available in the \nventure capital market in emerging Asia-Pacific; and (ii) resource mobilization, as a result of \nADB\u2019s involvement that crowds in commercial sources of venture capital.20 \n \n14.
