An overall initial environmental examination and three \nsample  initial  environmental  examinations  were  undertaken.  An \nenvironmental  assessment  and  review  procedure  was  prepared  to \nguide  the  environmental  assessment  of  subprojects  during \nimplementation. \n \nSector Investment Program  In October 2000, the Government of Karnataka (GoK) appointed the \nHigh Power Committee (HPC) to study regional imbalances within the \nstate  and  to  advise  GoK  on  remedial  measures  to  redress  such \nimbalances. Following a detailed analysis, the High Power Committee \nReport for Redressal of Regional Imbalances proposed an investment \nplan  of  Rs11,527  crores  ($2,652  million)  for  north  Karnataka.  The \ninvestment  plan  covers  many  sectors,  including  agriculture,  rural \ndevelopment,  irrigation,  energy,  industry  and  mining,  transport, \nscience and technology, financial services, and social services. Urban \ndevelopment and tourism, included in the social services sector, are \ngiven an allocation of about 33% ($862 million) of the total investment \nplan  and  are  recognized  as  priorities.  Based  on  the  HPC  report\u2019s \nrecommendation, GoK has initially selected 25 ULBs for assistance \nand  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  these \nurban local bodies (ULBs) in north Karnataka improve their delivery of \nbasic  urban  services.  Each  selected  ULB  prepared  a  city-level \ninfrastructure plan to articulate its needs in the form of investment \nprojects  in  five  areas  (sanitation  infrastructure,  water  supply \ninfrastructure, urban transport infrastructure, slum improvement, and \nnonmunicipal  infrastructure).  The  financing  plan  for  the  overall \nprogram in the HPC report includes state government funds, central \nGovernment  funds,  and  funds  from  ULBs,  the  National  Bank  for \nAgriculture  and  Rural  Development,  the  Housing  and  Urban \nDevelopment  Corporation,  ADB,  the  World  Bank,  and  bilateral \ndevelopment agencies. \n \n  The North Karnataka Urban Sector Investment Program will help GoK \nrehabilitate existing urban infrastructure facilities and construct new \nones in ULBs of north Karnataka. The Investment Program will assist \nGoK in meeting its urban sector investment plan and providing water \nsupply  systems,  sewerage  systems,  drainage,  and  urban  road \nresurfacing  and  junction  improvements.  The  living  environment  in \nslums will be improved with the provision of basic services. Firefighting \ncapacity improvements, tourism infrastructure, and lake rehabilitation \nare  also  included.  The  Investment  Program  will  introduce  private \nsector participation (PSP) in selected subsectors in selected ULBs and \nsupport  ongoing  institutional  reforms  and  training  for  ULB  staff \ncurrently being conducted by GoK under the Nirmala Nagar Program. \n   \n ", "iv   \nMultitranche Financing  The Government of India (the Government) has requested ADB to \nFacility  extend financing for the sector through a multitranche financing facility \n(MFF). The requested MFF amounts to $270 million over an 8-year \nperiod to finance the infrastructure investments and the institutional \ndevelopment of the selected Investment Program ULBs. \n \n   \nRationale  The HPC report indicates that while some diversification has taken \nplace in north Karnataka, agriculture remains the primary economic \ndriver  in  most  districts.  The  economy  has,  therefore,  remained \nsusceptible to weather patterns, and the current economic growth is \nnot shared across the state on an equitable basis. One of the reasons \nfor the limited diversification in north Karnataka is the lack of adequate \nurban infrastructure and services in the ULBs. \n \nThe  Investment  Program  supports  the  investment  plan  for  ULBs \nrecommended by the HPC report with their municipal functions, i.e., \nthe provision of basic urban infrastructure and services as mandated \nby the 74th Amendment Act to the Constitution of India. \n \nThe Investment Program would be a logical progression of previous \nADB assistance to the state in the southern and coastal areas and \nwould  specifically  address  the  imbalance  in  the  level  of  urban \ninfrastructure and services in ULBs in north Karnataka. Furthermore, \nthe  Investment  Program  would  provide  an  opportunity  to  further \ndevelop the ongoing relationship between ADB and the Karnataka \nUrban  Infrastructure  Development  and  Finance  Corporation  (the \nKUIDFC)  to  both  build  up  state-level  capability  and  to  promote \ninvolvement  by  the  private  sector  in  designing,  constructing,  and \noperating and maintaining infrastructure facilities for the efficient and \nequitable provision of basic urban infrastructure and services. Under \nthe  Karnataka  Municipalities  Act  (1964)  and  the  Municipality \nCorporations  Act  (1976),  ULBs  are  responsible  for  urban  service \ndelivery and operation and maintenance. To fulfill this responsibility \nwith the additional infrastructure to be created under the Investment \nProgram,  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  need  to  maintain  sound \nfinancial  management  and  employ  adequate,  capable  human \nresources. \n \nImpact and Outcome  The  impact  of  the  Investment  Program  is  improved  urban \ninfrastructure and services resulting in overall improvement of quality \nof life in the Investment Program ULBs, related increase in economic \nopportunities and growth in north Karnataka, and reduced imbalances \nbetween north Karnataka and the rest of the state. The Investment \nProgram will (i) improve urban services for at least the 4.3 million \npeople living in the initially identified 25 Investment Program ULBs; \n(ii) improve  and  sustain  infrastructure  services  within  Investment \nProgram ULBs, which will in turn benefit the agriculture, industry, and \ntourism sectors; and (iii) promote PSP in selected subsectors with the \naim  of  bringing  in  a  proper  incentive  framework  for  efficient  and \nequitable service provision and of linking the private sector\u2019s financial \nliquidity with the large investment requirements in the urban sector. \n   \nCost Estimates   The HPC report\u2019s investment plan amounts to $862 million, out of \nwhich the identified Investment Program is estimated to cost $440 \nmillion. \n \n ", "  v\nFinancing Plan       \nIdentified \nInvestment \nProgram  Percentage \nSource  ($ million)  of Total \nAsian Development Bank  270     61 \n    \nGovernment of Karnataka and  \n170     39 \nother agencies \nTotal  440    100 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nFacility Amount and Terms  An MFF of $270 million from the ordinary capital resources of ADB will \nbe provided to the Government. Final terms and conditions will be \ndetermined in the context of each loan and will be based on ADB\u2019s \nprevailing policies. Financing made available under each loan will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nfacility. The Government has the option to choose between eligible \ncurrencies and the interest rate regime most suitable for each loan. \nADB also provides flexibility in terms of repayment and interest swaps \nduring the financing period. Repayment schedules can be structured \nfor each loan to match the needs of each batch of subprojects with \ntheir cost-recovery and sustainability profiles. \n \n  The Government will onlend the amount to GoK on the same terms \nand conditions as the ADB loans under the MFF. GoK will pass on the \nproceeds of the loans to the implementing agencies in a mix of loan \nand grants based on agreed arrangements for the subsectors. GoK \nwill assume the foreign exchange risks for the loans under the MFF. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  30 June 2016 (the last periodic financing request submission by 31 \n  December 2013). \nEstimated Program   \nCompletion Date  31 December 2015. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation \n   \nImplementation  The head office of the KUIDFC, in coordination with the regional office \nArrangements  based in Dharwad, shall constitute the Program  Management Unit \n(PMU) for the Investment Program. The PMU will consist of a team of \ntechnical, administrative, social, environmental, and financial experts \nand officials that will assist with and monitor the Investment Program\u2019s \nimplementation  activities.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  the \nInvestment  Program  ULBs;  the  Karnataka  Urban  Slum  Clearance \nBoard; the Directorate of Municipal Administration; the Department of \nInformation, Tourism, and Youth Services; Karnataka State Fire and \nEmergency Services; the Lake Development Authority; the Karnataka \nUrban Water Supply and Drainage Board; and the KUIDFC. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement of all goods and services under the Investment Program \nwill be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines, \nas amended from time to time. To the extent possible, goods to be \nprocured will be grouped into packages larger than $1 million to be \nsuitable  for  international  competitive  bidding  procedures. \nMiscellaneous goods that cannot be grouped into larger contracts and \nare  estimated to cost less than $1 million per contract will be procured \n ", "vi   \n  through limited international bidding or national competitive bidding \nprocedures. Off-the-shelf items and standard products costing less \nthan $100,000 will be procured following ADB\u2019s shopping procedures. \n \nCivil works contracts estimated to cost $10 million or more will be \nprocured  through  international  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works \ncontracts  estimated  to  cost  less  than  $10  million  will  be  procured \nthrough national competitive bidding procedures. Subprojects under \nthe  PSP  modalities  (i.e.,  performance-based  deferred  payment \nstructure  [PBDPS]  and  performance-based  management  contract \n[PBMC])  will  be  procured,  in  principle,  through  performance-based \nprocurement  procedures  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  PBDPS  contracts  account  for  the  capital  investment \nsegment  for  initial  civil  works  and  the  10-year  operation  and \nmaintenance segment. Thus the international competitive bidding and \nnational competitive bidding threshold of $10 million will be applied to \nthe estimated capital investment cost segment. \n \nConsulting Services  Consultants will be selected and engaged using quality- and cost-\nbased selection procedures and/or least cost selection procedures in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. A total \nof about 1,700 person-months of consulting services will be required. \nFour national firms will be engaged as the program consultants to \nassist the PMU with overall project management and implementation \nand  the  implementing  agencies  with  design,  monitoring,  and \nsupervision of subprojects. The PMU will also engage one national \nfirm  as  the  program  performance  monitoring  system  consultant  to \nmonitor  and  assess  the  impacts  of  the  Investment  Program. \nPerformance-based  contract  may  be  used  as  agreed  by  ADB  for \nconsultancy packages. \n \nBenefits and Beneficiaries  The Investment Program will potentially benefit at least 4.3 million \npeople living in the initially identified 25 ULBs by providing them with \nimproved water supply, cleaner environmental conditions, safer and \nfaster urban transportation, and other public facilities. These physical \nimprovements  will  enhance  their  living  conditions  and  equip  the \nselected  ULBs  with  infrastructure  assets  to  provide  services  of  a \nreasonable quality for their residents, and thereby address the current \nimbalance between north Karnataka and the rest of the state. \n \n  The institutional development component of the Investment Program \nwill support the selected ULBs\u2019 efforts to increase property tax and \ntariff  revenues;  make  the  transition  to  a  fund-based  accounting \nsystem, which is compatible with international standards (i.e., double-\nentry,  accrual-based  accounting),  as  opposed  to  the  current, \nantiquated, single-entry, cash-based system; and build the technical \nand managerial capacity of the staff to maintain better-quality basic \nurban  services.  Through  the  PBDPS  and  PBMC  modalities,  the \nInvestment Program will mobilize private resources, including capital, \ntechnical,  and  managerial  skills  and  other  human  resources,  to \nimprove service delivery and minimize the costs incurred by GoK. \n \nRisks and Assumptions  The main risks include (i) Investment Program ULBs failing to manage \nand maintain the newly acquired and/or created assets properly and \nbeing  tempted  to  minimize  costs  through  inappropriate  operations; \n(ii) lack of acceptance of the required changes in water tariffs needed \nto  achieve  cost  recovery  within  a reasonable time frame; (iii) lack of \n ", "  vii\n  private  sector  interest  in  the  PBDPS  and  PBMC  procurement \nmodalities; (iv) conflicting upstream demands for water sources; and \n(v) delays in land acquisition that prevent construction activities. \n \nBased  on  lessons  from  global  experience  with  similar  contracting \napproaches, identifiable risks inherent in PSP arrangements, including \nthose identified during the preliminary sounding out of potential private \ncontractors,  will  be  mitigated  through  careful  design  of  the  PSP \ncontracts  and  of  the  underlying  legal  and  regulatory  regime.  The \nremaining  risks  will  be  allocated,  to  the  extent  possible,  to  those \nparties  best  able  to  bear  them.  This  principle  will  be  adopted  in \ndeveloping PSP contracts and associated bidding documents. \n ", "75o  00'E UTTARANCHAL 85o  00'E 78 o 00'E\nHARYANA\nARUNCHAL\nDelhi SIKKIM PRADESH\nUTTAR A S S A M INDIA\n25o  00'N RAJASTHAN PRADESH BIHAR MEG2H5Ao L A0Y0A'N NORTH KARNATAKA\nJHARKHANDWEST TRIPURA URBAN SECTOR INVESTMENT PROGRAM\nGUJARAT BENGAL MIZORAM\nMADHYA  PRADESH\nCHHATTISGARH\nO R I S S A B a y   o f\nGulf  of B e n g a l\nCambay MAHARASHTRA\nANDHRA\nPRADESH\nGOA\nKARNATAKA\nMAHARASTHRA\nA r a b i a n Bangalore I N D I A N      O C E A N BIDAR\nS e a 18 o 00'N 18 o 00'N\nTAMIL Basavakalyan\n10o  00'N KERALA NADU 10o  00'N Bidar\n75o  00'E 85o  00'E Gulbarga\nShahabad\no\n74  00'E\nGULBARGA\nBijapur\nJamkhandi BIJAPUR Yadgir\nNippani\nRabkavi-Banhatti ANDHRA  PRADESH\nBAGALKOT\nGokak Raichur\nBELGAUM\nBadami Ilkal RAICHUR\nBelgaum\nSindhanoor\nDHARWAD KOPPAL\nGadag-Betageri Gangavathi\nG OA\nDharwad\nSupa Hubli GADAG Koppal Bellary N\nHospet\nUTTARAKANNDA BELLARY 0 25 50 75 100\nSirsi Haveri HAVERI\nKilometers\nRanebennur DAVANGERE\nDavangere\nChitradurg\nSagar CHITRADURG\nSHIMOGA\nShimoga Bhadravati\nA r a b i a n     S e a Hosdurga\nUDUPI Kadur Chikballanpur\nCHIKMAGALUR\nTUMKUR\nUdupi Chikmagalur Harnahalli KOLAR\nTumkur\nProject District\nHassan Kolar\nProject Urban Local Body Mangalore DASHINA Bangalore\nHASSAN\nNational Capital Bantyal KANNADA\nBANGALORE\nState Capital MANDYA\nUrban Local Body Mercara Mandya Charmapatna\nNational Road KODAGU Hunsur Srirangapatnam\nOther Road Mysore\nRailway MYSORE\n12 o 00'N River CHAAMRAJNAGAR 12 o 00'N\nChamarajnagar\nDistrict Boundary TAMIL  NADU\nKERALA\nState Boundary\nInternational Boundary\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n74 o 00'E 78 o 00'E\n06-3574 HR", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility to India for the North Karnataka Urban Sector Investment Program.1  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Rapid  urbanization  and  underinvestment  in  infrastructure  have  resulted  in  serious \nenvironmental  and  health  problems  in  India\u2019s  cities.  Most  urban  households,  particularly  poor \nhouseholds, have limited access to potable water, sanitation, and drainage facilities and services. \nThe Government\u2019s2 successive five-year plans stressed rural development, and it was not until the \neighth five-year plan for fiscal year (FY) 1992\u20131997 that the Government specifically recognized the \nrole and importance of the urban sector. This change in emphasis, together with India\u2019s focus on \neconomic liberalization; financial sector reform; and passage of the 74th Constitutional Amendment \nAct in 1992, which laid out the basis for decentralization in the urban sector, has brought about \nsome improvements, but large inefficiencies in service delivery, inadequate investment to expand \nservice coverage, and lack of maintenance persist. \n \n3.  This is the case throughout the state of Karnataka, but is more pronounced in the urban \nlocal  bodies  (ULBs)  in  north  Karnataka.  Water  supply  in  the  vast  majority  of  ULBs  in  north \nKarnataka is intermittent, and is often as infrequent as once every 3 days to once a week. Only a \nfew ULBs receive piped water for 1 to 2 hours every day, and the water quality is usually poor. \nService coverage is limited and, on average, houses with water supply connections account for only \n67% of those registered for property taxes. Where sewerage systems have been constructed, \ncoverage is limited, and generally only the older, or more affluent, sections of the ULBs are served. \nOnly a few sewage treatment plants exist, and many of these do not function well, if at all. Storm \nwater drainage facilities are inadequate, poorly maintained, and frequently misused for solid waste \ndisposal. Roads are generally unpaved and junctions inefficient. Slums exist in most ULBs in north \nKarnataka and are served by only the most basic water supply and sanitation services. Each public \nstandpost (public tap) serves up to about 300 people, and sanitation is limited to poorly constructed \nlatrines. Details of the existing levels of urban infrastructure and services in each of the Investment \nProgram ULBs are presented in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  The financial performance of ULBs in north Karnataka is poor, and current tariffs and \ncharges cover barely 20% of the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs of urban services. These \nULBs rely heavily on state subsidies to pay electric bills and other operating costs. Because of a \nlong-term freeze on staff recruitment, the ULBs do not currently have the institutional capacity or \nskills required to properly manage, operate, and maintain existing urban infrastructure facilities and \nservices. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n5.  In October 2000, the Government of Karnataka (GoK) appointed the High Power Committee \n(HPC) to study regional imbalances within the state and to advise GoK on remedial measures to \nredress  the  imbalances.  Based  on  detailed  analysis,  the  High  Power  Committee  Report  for \nRedressal  of  Regional  Imbalances3 proposed  an  investment  plan  of  Rs11,527  crores  ($2,652 \nmillion) in north Karnataka. The investment plan covers many sectors, including agriculture, rural \ndevelopment, irrigation, energy, industry and mining, transport, science and technology, financial \nservices,  and  social  services.  Urban  development  and  tourism,  which  are  included  in  social \nservices, are given an allocation of about 33% ($862 million) of the total investment plan and are \nrecognized as priorities. The financing plan for the overall program in the HPC report includes state \ngovernment  funds,  central  Government  funds,  funds  from  the  ULBs,  the  National  Bank  for \nAgriculture and Rural Development, the Housing and Urban Development Corporation, the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and bilateral development agencies. \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework for the Investment Program is presented in Appendix 1. \n2  \u201cGovernment\u201d refers to the Government of India. \n3  Government of Karnataka. 2002. High Power Committee Report for Redressal of Regional Imbalances. Bangalore. \n ", "2   \n \n6.  The HPC report indicates that while some diversification has taken place in north Karnataka, \nagriculture remains the primary economic driver in most districts. The economy has, therefore, \nremained  susceptible  to  weather  patterns,  and  the  current  economic  growth  is  not  shared \nthroughout the state on an equitable basis. The key reason for the limited diversification in north \nKarnataka is the lack of adequate urban infrastructure and services in the ULBs. The goal of the \ninvestment plan proposed by the HPC report is to increase economic growth in backward clusters \nof ULBs (known as taluks) and to reduce imbalances between north Karnataka and the rest of the \nstate. \n \n7.  Based on the HPC report\u2019s recommendation, GoK asked ADB to help selected ULBs in \nnorth Karnataka improve their delivery of basic urban services. The Investment Program supports \nthe investment plan recommended by the HPC report. \n \n8.  The Investment Program has initially identified 25 ULBs located in north Karnataka to be \nassisted with their municipal functions, i.e., delivery of basic urban services as mandated by the \n74th Constitutional Amendment Act of India. The assumption is that improvements in the urban \nsector will effectively stimulate economic growth, as economic activities in urban areas contribute \ndisproportionately to the region\u2019s overall economy. Each Investment Program ULB has prepared a \ncity-level infrastructure plan (CLIP) for improving its urban environment based on its needs for basic \nurban infrastructure and services. As each ULB proposed many subprojects, ADB proposed a \nsector loan approach to allow flexibility in selecting subprojects and to enable investment that is \nlinked to reforms by means of subproject selection criteria. \n \n9.  The Investment Program will support that part of the investment plan proposed by the HPC \nreport that focuses on urban infrastructure development. The Investment Program will initially focus \non investments in priority components, namely, water supply, sanitation, and slum improvement. \nInstitutional development and nonmunicipal infrastructure components will also be implemented \nduring  the  first  phase.  Upon  successful  progress  in  relation  to  the  foregoing  activities,  the \nInvestment  Program  will  then  start  investments  in  urban  transport  infrastructure.  Appendix  3 \npresents  subproject  selection  criteria  agreed  on  between  GoK  and  ADB  for  the  Investment \nProgram. \n \n10.  The sector loan approach is based on the following context: \n(i)  GoK has analyzed regional imbalances within the state in a systematic manner and \nhas made recommendations that include urban development as one of the key \ninvestment  priorities  in  order  to  reduce  the  imbalances.  Furthermore,  GoK  has \nalready started implementing some of the recommendations from the HPC report \nusing its own resources. \n(ii)  The  executing  agency  is  the  Karnataka  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  and \nFinance  Corporation  (the  KUIDFC),  which  has  proven  that  it  is  capable  of \nimplementing urban development components in the Investment Program ULBs as \npart of the HPC investment plan. The KUIDFC has already implemented two ADB-\nassisted  projects,  as  well  as  other  externally-funded  and  domestically-funded \nprojects, in the urban sector. Supplementary Appendix A presents a detailed analysis \nof the KUIDFC\u2019s capabilities as an executing agency.  \n(iii)  Policies to support the CLIPs, including municipal reforms and tariff reforms, are \nongoing, and GoK has already initiated reform activities and the studies required to \nimplement these policies. \n \n11.  The development of urban infrastructure in the southern and coastal areas of Karnataka has \ncontinued  with  the  assistance  of  ADB  funding,  which  began  in  1993.  The  Karnataka  Urban \nInfrastructure  Development  Project  (the  KUIDP)4 provided  total  assistance  of  $105  million  for \nformulating an integrated urban development strategy for the Bangalore subregion. The KUIDP \nprovided an opportunity to develop \u201ccounter magnet\u201d urban locations, or growth centers, to reduce \ncongestion in Bangalore by including a component directed toward improving infrastructure in the \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1995. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans to India for the \nKarnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Project. Manila (Loan 1415-IND and Loan 1416-IND, for $85 million and \n$20 million, respectively, approved on 14 December 1995). \n ", "    3 \nfour  ULBs  of  Channapatna,  Mysore,  Ramanagaram,  and  Tumkur.  The  ULBs  of  Maddur  and \nMandya were subsequently added. The Karnataka Urban Development and Coastal Environmental \nManagement  Project  (KUDCEMP) 5  provided  assistance  of  $145  million  to  support  urban \ninfrastructure development in 10 coastal ULBs6 and to facilitate policy reforms to strengthen urban \nmanagement.  The  objectives  of  KUDCEMP  included  (i) strengthening  the  capacity  of  local \ngovernments in relation to resource generation and cost recovery to achieve sustainability in the \nO&M of the investments; and (ii) establishing appropriate environmental planning, management, \nand monitoring mechanisms to address the potential environmental impacts associated with urban \nand industrial growth in the region. KUDCEMP initially experienced implementation delays, but is \ncurrently rated as satisfactory by the ADB\u2019s project performance monitoring system. Appendix 2 \npresents details of external assistance to the urban sector in India. \n \n12.  The  executing  agency  for  both  these  previous  projects  was  the  KUIDFC,  which  was \nincorporated in 1993 under the Companies Act (1956) and is wholly owned by GoK. The KUIDFC \nhas the following functions: (i) formulating and appraising urban infrastructure projects, (ii) providing \nfinancial and technical assistance to municipalities and development agencies, (iii) mobilizing funds \nfrom various sources, (iv) implementing and monitoring projects, (v) formulating and implementing \ncapacity-building  programs  for  the  effective  delivery  of  urban  services,  and  (vi) assisting  with \nmunicipal sector reforms. Following its experience with implementing the KUIDP, KUDCEMP, and \nother externally-funded and domestically-funded projects, the KUIDFC has now evolved into an \nagency capable of managing large projects for GoK. \n \n13.  The Investment Program, which will include urban infrastructure development in ULBs in \nnorth Karnataka, would be a logical progression of previous ADB assistance to the state in the \nsouthern and coastal areas and would specifically address the imbalance in the level of basic urban \ninfrastructure and services in the ULBs in north Karnataka. Furthermore, the Investment Program \nwould provide an opportunity to further develop the ongoing relationship between ADB and the \nKUIDFC and build up state-level capability, as well as to promote involvement by the private sector \nin the design, construction, and O&M of infrastructure facilities for efficient and equitable provision \nof basic urban infrastructure and services. Urban service delivery and O&M are the responsibility of \nULBs under the Karnataka Municipalities Act (1964) and Municipality Corporations Act (1976). Even \nthough  some  Investment  Program  ULBs  adopting  the  performance-based  deferred  payment \nstructure (PBDPS) and performance-based management contract (PBMC) modalities, which are \nelaborated in Paras. 54 through 57, will delegate asset creation and O&M responsibilities to private \ncontractors, the ultimate responsibility for tariff setting, billing, and revenue collection will still remain \nwith the Investment Program ULBs. To fulfill this responsibility for the additional infrastructure to be \ncreated under the Investment Program, the Investment Program ULBs need to maintain sound \nfinancial management and employ sufficient, capable human resources. As the initial step of the \nreform, the monthly tariffs for unmetered domestic water use have been increased from Rs45 \n(previously the uniform tariff across the state) to at least Rs55 per month in all 25 ULBs that have \nbeen identified as initial Investment Program ULBs.7 \n \n14.  The Investment Program is compatible with the Government\u2019s 10th five-year plan (FY2002\u2013\nFY2007), which targets economic growth of 8% per year and focuses on four basic themes: (i) high \ngrowth,  (ii) equitable  growth,  (iii) human  development,  and  (iv) reforms.  With  80%  of  planned \nbudget allocations targeting social expenditures, the 10th five-year plan aims to reduce poverty by \nensuring access to education, health care, potable water, and sanitation. The 10th five-year plan \nalso focuses on good governance as a cross-cutting theme and identifies the declining role of \ngovernment in the provision of services. The plan emphasizes the development of private sector \nparticipation (PSP) in service delivery and the provision of an improved regulatory environment. \n \n15.  The proposed Investment Program is highly relevant to ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \n(CSP) for India, which rests on the three pillars of (i) pro-poor growth for reducing income poverty, \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1999. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India for the \nKarnataka Urban Development and Coastal Environmental Management Project. Manila (Loan 1704-IND, for $145 \nmillion, approved on 26 October 1999). \n6  Ankola, Bhatkal, Dandeli, Kandapura, Karwar, Mangalore, Puttur, Sirsi, Udupi, and Ullal. \n7  There is no longer a single statewide uniform tariff. The new  monthly tariffs for unmetered domestic water use for the \n25 ULBs now range from Rs55 to Rs90. \n ", "4   \n(ii) social development for reducing human poverty, and (iii) good governance for leveraging and \nmaximizing the impact of development. As stated in the CSP, the private sector accounts for three \nfourths of both gross domestic product and investments in India, and even though the private sector \nhas grown considerably during the last two decades, the CSP notes that poor infrastructure has \nconstrained this growth. The development of improved infrastructure is, therefore, the backbone of \nthe CSP and accounts for 80% of ADB\u2019s 2005\u20132007 lending program. The CSP expresses a strong \ndesire to use ADB funding to leverage increased PSP in the urban sector. The sheer scale of the \nrequirements for urban infrastructure investment in India indicates that public financing through the \ngovernment budget together with multilateral and bilateral agency financing will be insufficient to \nachieve the desired improvements. Thus the Investment Program intends to establish a viable PSP \nbusiness model that will link existing financial liquidity in the private sector with the large investment \nrequirements in the urban sector, in particular, the water supply and sanitation and urban transport \nsubsectors. \n \n16.  GoK is currently implementing comprehensive reforms in line with the 10th five-year plan \nand, through the Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA), is implementing the Nirmala Nagar \nProgram  (NNP).  The  latter  is  a  six-module  program  funded,  among  others,  by  ADB  under \nKUDCEMP that is addressing the key issues of (i) property taxes, (ii) accounting, (iii) thrift and credit \ninstitutions, (iv) public toilets, (v) rainwater harvesting, and (vi) solid waste management. The NNP \nis being supported by a well-prepared human resources policy designed to abolish obsolete or \nredundant positions and recruit well-qualified professionals, such as accountants and environmental \nengineers,  through  competitive  selection  procedures.  Improving  the  poor  rates  of  property \nassessment  and  registration  for  tax  purposes  and  of  property  tax  collection  has  been  a  key \nobjective, as only about 75% of the properties in the state are assessed and registered, and of \nthese, only 50% actually pay property taxes. The unrealized additional tax revenues are on the \norder of $70 million annually, and the DMA is currently 70% of the way through an ambitious \nprogram to survey 3 million properties in the 63 ULBs initially targeted under the reforms. The NNP \nis being supported by well-designed management information and geographic information systems \nthat were developed by the eGovernments Foundation. The software packages being used are \nhighly advanced. \n \n17.  Under the KUIDP, GoK developed the fund-based accounting system, which is compatible \nwith international standards (i.e., double-entry, accrual-based accounting), using Bangalore and \nTumkur as pilot cases. The system has been working reasonably well, and the DMA upgraded it as \npart of the ongoing sector reforms before rolling it out to the 63 ULBs targeted for the first phase of \nreforms. As of April 2006, the fund-based accounting system was already being implemented in all \n63 ULBs. These 63 ULBs include all 25 of the initially identified Investment Program ULBs. The \nInvestment Program will support the ULBs\u2019 efforts to increase property tax revenues and tariff \nrevenues; make the transition from the current, antiquated, single-entry, cash-based system to the \nfund-based accounting system; and build the technical and managerial capacity of the staff to \nmaintain better quality urban services by complementing the ongoing NNP urban reform initiatives. \nIn  particular,  policy  dialogues  have  been  conducted  between  the  KUIDFC  and  ADB  and  an \nagreement has been reached on overall water supply and sewerage tariff reforms, which started out \nwith an increase in the current monthly flat-rate water tariffs for unmetered water and will be \nfollowed by careful adoption of a volumetric tariff schedule for metered water. \n \n18.  In parallel with the NNP, the Urban Development Department of GoK, through the KUIDFC, \nis conducting the Karnataka Urban Water Sector Improvement Project (KUWASIP) with assistance \nfrom the World Bank. Activities already undertaken include (i) the water supply demonstration \nschemes in selected zones in the ULBs of Belgaum, Gulbarga, and Hubli-Dharwad that provide \nwater for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week; (ii) an implementation of rapid social assessment and \npreparation  of  communication  strategy;  and  (iii) an  implementation  of  environmental  impact \nassessment. Studies currently being carried out under KUWASIP include (i) the establishment and \noperationalization  of  the  Karnataka  State  Urban  Water  Supply  Council,  (ii) the  creation  of \ninformation on water supply and sanitation and the benchmarking of service provision, (iii) the \nstrengthening of urban water supply and sanitation service delivery in ULBs, and (iv) the investment \nin the water and sanitation sector and tariff reforms. A key component of KUWASIP is a contract \ninvolving  the  KUIDFC:  the  ULBs  of  Belgaum,  Gulbarga,  and  Hubli-Dharwad;  and  a  private \ncontractor to run the water supply demonstration schemes in selected zones of the three ULBs to \nshow how well a water supply system can be run when a capable and experienced management \nunit is put in place. This relates not only to the quantity and quality of water supplied, but also to the \n ", "    5 \nimproved efficiency in meter reading, system maintenance, and response to customers\u2019 problems \nand complaints. \n \n19.  Stakeholder consultations conducted in the initially identified 25 Investment Program ULBs \nindicate a strong desire for improved urban infrastructure and services. Water supply was given the \nhighest priority in 18 of the 25 selected ULBs, while sanitation was ranked second and drainage \nwas ranked third. Urban transport was given the lowest priority in 11 of the 25 ULBs. In the slum \nareas, preference for water supply was overwhelming, followed by sanitation. Drainage and urban \ntransport  were  not  ranked  as  highly,  reflecting  a  desperate  need  for  the  most  basic  urban \ninfrastructure. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The  impact  of  the  Investment  Program  is  improved  urban  infrastructure  and  services \nresulting in overall improvement of quality of life in the Investment Program ULBs, related increase \nin economic opportunities and growth in north Karnataka, and reduced imbalances between north \nKarnataka and the rest of the state. To achieve this impact, the Investment Program will help the \nparticipating  ULBs  rehabilitate  existing  urban  infrastructure  facilities  and  construct  new  ones, \nincluding  water  supply  systems,  sewerage  systems,  and  drainage,  along  with  urban  transport \nimprovements. The living environment of urban slums will be improved with the provision of basic \nservices.  The  Investment  Program  also  includes  firefighting  capacity  improvements,  tourism \ninfrastructure  improvements,  and  lake  rehabilitation.  The  Investment  Program  will  support  the \ninstitutional reforms and training for ULB staff currently being conducted under the ongoing NNP. \nThe Investment Program is expected to (i) improve urban services for at least the 4.3 million people \nliving in the initially identified 25 ULBs; (ii) improve and sustain infrastructure services within the \nparticipating ULBs, which will in turn benefit the agriculture, industry, and tourism sectors; and \n(iii) introduce PSP in selected subsectors with the aim of introducing a proper incentive framework \nfor efficient and equitable service provision and linking the private sector\u2019s financial liquidity with the \nlarge requirements for investment in the urban sector. \nB.  Outputs \n21.  The outputs of the Investment Program will be derived from the following components:8 \n(i)  component A: sanitation infrastructure, \n(ii)  component B: water supply infrastructure, \n(iii)  component C: slum improvement, \n(iv)  component D: nonmunicipal infrastructure, \n(v)  component E: urban transport infrastructure, \n(vi)  component F: institutional development, and \n(vii)  component G: Investment Program assistance facility. \n \n22.  Components A, B, C, and E are designed to address the basic urban sector needs of the \nInvestment  Program  ULBs;  component  D  is  designed  to  incorporate  tourism  and  disaster \nmanagement services for the Investment Program ULBs; component F is designed to assist with \ncapacity-building initiatives and staff training requirements in the Investment Program ULBs; and \ncomponent G is designed to assist with implementation of the Investment Program. Except for the \nthree ULBs\u2014Belgaum, Gulbarga, and Hubli-Dharwad\u2014currently being assisted under the World \nBank-funded KUWASIP and, therefore, not expecting any financing for component B under the \nInvestment Program, most Investment Program ULBs have subprojects under components A and \nB,  i.e.,  most  of  the  investments  are  focused  on  the  provision  of  water  supply  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure. \n \n23.  All the initially identified 25 Investment Program ULBs are covered by the ongoing NNP. The \nreforms being implemented under the NNP will support the institutional framework under which the \nULBs  are  designing,  constructing,  operating,  and  maintaining  basic  urban  infrastructure  and \nservices. These reforms may still be ongoing at the time of effectiveness of the first loan and the \n                                                 \n8  Solid waste collection and disposal facilities and sports facilities are integral parts of GoK\u2019s investment plan; however, \nGoK has decided to finance these facilities using its own funds. \n ", "6   \nInvestment  Program  may  have  to  be  implemented  in  parallel  with  the  reforms.  Hence,  the \nimplementation of reform measures (i.e., property tax reform and revenue mobilization measures) \nwill be closely monitored throughout the Investment Program. \n \n1.  Component A: Sanitation Infrastructure \n24.  This component comprises (i) sewerage and sanitation, which includes rehabilitation and/or \nexpansion of existing systems (sewer networks, sewage pumping stations, and sewage treatment \nplants), and construction of new systems; and (ii) urban drainage, which includes improvements to \nprimary and secondary drains. \n \n2.  Component B: Water Supply Infrastructure \n25.  This component comprises (i) the rehabilitation of existing systems, that is, of intakes, \ntreatment plants, transmission mains, and distribution networks (including mains and reservoirs); \nand (ii) the provision of new infrastructure, including expansions of the distribution network and the \nprovision of additional house connections in both the existing and expanded service areas in the \nInvestment Program ULBs. \n \n3.  Component C: Slum Improvement \n26.  This component will address the poor environmental conditions in low-income settlements. \nThe Investment Program aims to build on the successful experiences of the KUIDP and KUDCEMP \nwith the help of nongovernment organizations. The subprojects include community development \nprograms,  such  as  the  initiation  of  self-help  groups,  the  launching  of  health  and  sanitation \nawareness campaigns, and the provision of low-cost sanitation facilities to improve the environment \nin these settlements. \n \n4.  Component D: Nonmunicipal Infrastructure \n27.  This component focuses on such nonmunicipal infrastructure as firefighting and emergency \nservices, tourism, and lake rehabilitation in selected ULBs. \n \n5.  Component E: Urban Transport Infrastructure \n28.  This  component  comprises  improvements  to  the  urban  roads  of  the  public  works \ndepartments of the ULBs and the state. It involves improving and strengthening critical road links, \nroad safety measures, and traffic management measures. Urban transport improvement will be \nundertaken in Investment Program ULBs based on their progress with regard to implementing \ncomponents A, B, and C under the Investment Program. \n \n6.  Component F: Institutional Development \n29.  This component will support the DMA\u2019s current institutional reform efforts under the NNP. It \nwill be managed by the DMA, and will consist of capacity building within Investment Program ULBs \nthrough \n(i)  introducing computerization, property tax assessment, and utility line mapping using \na geographic information system; \n(ii)  facilitating the transition of ULB accounting functions to the fund-based accounting \nsystem; and \n(iii)  providing  training  for  ULB  and  state  line  department  staff  in  relation  to  project \nimplementation and urban management. \n \n30.  The training will include courses and sessions on urban management to be conducted by \ninstitutes like the Indian Institute of Management and the Indian Institute of Science. All seminars, \nconferences, and city visits to learn from best practices to be funded under the Investment Program \nshall take place in India. \n \n7.  Component G: Investment Program Assistance Facility \n31.  This  component  comprises  consulting  services  for  Investment  Program  implementation \nsupport, financing for the Program Management Unit (PMU), and incremental administration costs \nfor the KUIDFC and other agencies involved in implementing the Investment Program. Civil works \nfor the KUIDFC office building in Bangalore are also provided under this component. \n ", "    7 \n \nC.  Special Features \n32.  Private Sector Participation Schemes. In addition to ADB\u2019s conventional procurement \nmodalities, an alternative PSP procurement modality referred to as the PBDPS will be used for \nselected subprojects in selected ULBs to increase the extent of PSP. This modality requires private \ncontractors to provide some of the bridge financing for the construction and subsequent O&M costs \nof the subprojects in exchange for annuity-like payments over a 10-year period that consist of base \nfees and bonuses linked to predetermined key performance indicators. The PBDPS is expected to \nhelp (i) introduce private investment into the sector, thereby facilitating greater leverage of public \nfunds; and (ii) achieve higher accountability on the part of contractors by combining construction \nand actual service delivery during the operational phase into a single contract package. \n \n33.  As the PBDPS is still at an early stage of development, the level of contractor interest is not \nyet clear. Should the risk-sharing aspects of the PBDPS be unpalatable to the private sector, an \nalternative PSP modality, the PBMC, will be used instead. Under the PBMC modality, civil works \nare  procured  through  conventional  procurement  modalities  and  the  managing  contractor  is \nresponsible for overall management of the provision of services and the O&M of the facilities, \ntypically over a 5- to 6-year period. The management contractor will be also reimbursed by means \nof  base  fees  and  bonuses  linked  to  predetermined  key  performance  indicators.  The  best \nprocurement  modality  will  be  chosen  following  consultations  with  and  surveys  of  potential \ncontractors. Lessons from the PBDPS and PBMC modalities based on global experience with \nsimilar contracting approaches by other multilateral and bilateral development agencies and their \napplication  in  India\u2019s  urban  sector  have  been  assessed  and  are  presented  in  Supplementary \nAppendix E. These lessons and the results of the consultations and surveys will be incorporated in \nthe contract documents. \n \n34.  The intent of the proposed PSP schemes is to provide optimal risk-sharing arrangements \nbetween ULBs and private contractors and to create an incentive framework to promote private \nsector  efficiency  through  performance-based  and/or  output-based  service  provision  for  the \nsubprojects. Appendixes 4 and 5 present the key features and outline terms of reference for the \nPBDPS contracts and the PBMC contracts, respectively, and Supplementary Appendix D presents \na more detailed description of the PBDPS contracts. \n \n35.  Multitranche Financing Facility. The Investment Program will use ADB\u2019s MFF. The MFF \nmodality is particularly well suited for the Investment Program because (i) the aim of the Investment \nProgram  is  to  support  the  GoK\u2019s  long-term  objectives  as  stated  in  the  HPC  report;  (ii)   the \nperformance of previous loans can guide the provision of subsequent loans, thereby offering proper \nincentives  in  relation  to  implementation;  (iii) the  implementation  period  for  urban  development \nprojects is generally longer than projects for other sectors, including the initial detailed design and \nengineering period; (iv) the MFF can allow the flexibility required for the Investment Program to \nsupport participating 25 ULBs with different needs and absorptive capacities; and (v) the proposed \nperformance-based contract schemes require contract periods that are longer than the conventional \ncontract modality. \n \n36.  The subprojects and components under the first loan with an estimated cost of $51.4 million \n(ADB financing of $33 million and a GoK contribution of $18.4 million) were fully appraised and \nincluded in the first periodic financing request (PFR). The first loan covers sanitation and water \nsupply infrastructure in 3 ULBs, firefighting equipment in 23 ULBs, tourism infrastructure in 6 ULBs, \ngeographic  information  systems  and  other  hardware  in  21  ULBs,  5  consultancy  packages, \nincremental administration costs, and the KUIDFC building. No PSP contracts will be financed \nunder the first loan, as further preparation for PSP contracts is required under the bridging technical \nassistance  (TA).  Each  individual  loan  will  finance  mutually  exclusive  distinctive  packages, \nsubprojects, and/or components. \n \n37.  Bridging Technical Assistance. The $400,000 in grant-funding for the bridging TA will be \nmade available under the TA Cluster for Project Processing and Capacity Development9 to support \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2006.

The total cost of the Investment Program from 2006 to 2015 is $862 million out of which the \nidentified investment requirements under the MFF are estimated to cost $440 million (Table 1). \nAppendix 6 presents indicative cost estimates for the MFF (estimated total costs of $440 million). \n \nTable 1: Cost Estimates for the Investment Program \n($ million) \n \nTotal Investment  Identified Investments \nRequirements  under Asian \nDevelopment Bank \nComponent  ($ million)  Loans ($ million)  Share (%) \nA  Sanitation Infrastructure   360  163  37 \nB  Water Supply Infrastructure  200  92  21 \nC  Slum Improvement  27  12  3 \nD  Nonmunicipal Infrastructure  67  31  7 \nE  Urban Transport Infrastructure  199  91  21 \nF  Institutional Development  9  4  1 \nG  Investment Program Assistance       \nFacilitya  0  47  10 \n    Total Investment Program  862  440  100 \na  For total investment requirements, the cost of component G is distributed among components A\u2013F. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates; High Power Committee Report for Redressal of Regional Imbalances. \nE.  Financing Plan \n39.  The Government has requested financing up to $270 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the Investment Program. The financing will be provided under the \nMFF in accordance with ADB policy.10 The MFF will extend multiple loans to finance a range of \nsubprojects and components under the Investment Program, subject to the submission of a related \nPFR  by  the  Government  and  the  execution  of  the  related  Loan  Agreement  and  Project \nAgreement(s). The Government has entered into an FFA with ADB and is required to comply with \nthe agreement\u2019s requirements. Pursuant to the FFA, the Government has submitted the first PFR in \nan amount of $33 million to ADB. The loans under the MFF will finance civil works, equipment, \nconsulting  services,  training,  and  incremental  administration  costs.  The  minimum  amount  of \nsubsequent  PFRs  will  be  $50  million.  All  provisions  of  ordinary  operations  loan  regulations \napplicable to ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based loans11 will apply to each loan, \nsubject to modifications, if any, that may be included under any loan and project agreement. The \nGovernment has the option to choose between eligible currencies and the interest rate regime for \neach loan. The specific terms of each loan will be based on the related PFR, with interest to be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility. The Government has provided \nADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2005.

Although no cofinancing is envisaged at this time, if needed, cofinancing from commercial \nsources  may  be  mobilized  in  the  future  to  complement  ADB  financing  for  the  MFF.  Such \ncofinancing may benefit from ADB credit enhancements, including ADB guarantee instruments, and \nwill be presented separately for Board consideration as and when the need arises. \n \n41.  The Government will onlend the proceeds of the loans under the MFF to GoK on the same \nterms and conditions as the ADB loans.

GoK will pass on the proceeds of the loans to the implementing agencies in a mix of loans \nand grants based on the agreed arrangements for the subsectors. The loans will be provided for the \nwater supply subprojects, and have a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, and the \ninterest rate will be determined in accordance with the incentive scheme adopted by GoK to \nencourage  the  ULBs  to  implement  reforms.  The  implementing  agencies  will  make  required \ncontributions either from their own resources or from the State Finance Commission\u2019s allocations \nfor the respective implementing agencies. GoK will assume the foreign exchange risks on the ADB \nloans. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Investment Program Management \n43.  The executing agency for the Investment Program will be GoK acting through the KUIDFC. \nThe KUIDFC is a fully state-owned company that was incorporated in 1993 under the Companies \nAct (1956). As a nodal agency for urban infrastructure projects financed by GoK, the KUIDFC has \nalready  successfully  implemented  the  first  ADB-assisted  project,  the  KUIDP,  and  is  now \nimplementing  the  second  ADB-assisted  project,  KUDCEMP.  In  addition  to  being  the  project \nmanager, the KUIDFC will act as a conduit of funds between GoK, which will disburse the ADB loan \nfunds to the ULBs via the KUIDFC, and the ULBs which will repay agreed portions of the ADB loan \nfunds to GoK via the KUIDFC. Supplementary Appendix A provides detailed information on the \nroles,  the  capabilities,  and  a  financial  assessment  of  the  KUIDFC,  GoK,  and  the  Investment \nProgram ULBs. \n \n44.  The head office of the KUIDFC, in coordination with its regional office based in Dharwad, will \nconstitute the PMU for the Investment Program. The PMU will be headed by the managing director \nof the KUIDFC as the program director at the head office and by the executive program director12 at \nthe regional office who reports to the program director. The program director will be responsible for \noverall implementation and management of the Investment Program and for coordination with and \nreporting to the state-level empowered committee for the Investment Program, which is made up of \n                                                 \n12 The executive program director will be an officer from the Indian Administrative Service. \n ", "10   \nrepresentatives of GoK, the Government, and ADB, while the executive program director will be \nresponsible  for  day-to-day  implementation  activities  for  the  Investment  Program.  The  PMU\u2019s \nregional  office  will  be  staffed  with  properly  qualified  and  sufficiently  experienced  experts  and \nofficials and will include divisions related to engineering, community development, accounting and \nfinance, land acquisition, and administration. \n \n45.  Four divisional PMU offices will be established in Belgaum, Bellary, Dharwad, and Gulbarga \nto supervise the implementing agencies in each geographical area.13 Each divisional office will be \nheaded by a divisional program director14 who will report to the executive program director. The \ndivisional offices, assisted by the respective program consultant teams, will be responsible for \nproject planning, preparation of subprojects and cost estimates, coordination, technical guidance \nand supervision, financial control, training, and overall subproject monitoring; and will also assist the \nULBs in this regard for the respective components. \n \n46.  The  implementing  agencies  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be  as  follows:  (i) for \ncomponents A, B, and E: the respective ULBs15 reporting to the respective divisional program \ndirector, except for bulk water supply schemes of component B, for which the implementing agency \nwill be the Karnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board (KUWSDB), on behalf of the \nrespective ULBs, reporting to the respective divisional program director;16 (ii) for component C: the \nKarnataka Slum Clearance Board reporting to the executive program director; (iii) for component D: \nthe  Department  of  Information,  Tourism  and  Youth  Services,  the  Karnataka  State  Fire  and \nEmergency  Services,  the  Lake  Development  Authority,  and  relevant  ULBs  reporting  to  the \nexecutive program director; (iv) for component F: the DMA and/or the KUIDFC reporting to the \nprogram director; and (v) for component G: the KUIDFC reporting to the program director. ULBs \nintending to delegate the implementation responsibilities of bulk water supply schemes to the \nKUWSDB are required to pass relevant resolutions. Tender evaluation committees to evaluate \ntenders and provide recommendations on issues related to all works that will subsequently be \nforwarded for approval to the ULB commissioner will be set up. Each tender evaluation committee \nwill consist of a ULB engineer, a representative of the KUIDFC, and a member of the program \nconsultant team with relevant expertise. \n \n47.  A state-level empowered committee has been formed to oversee the Investment Program. \nCommittee members include the additional chief secretary (the committee chair), the principal \nsecretary  of  the  Urban  Development  Department,  the  principal  secretary  of  the  Planning \n                                                 \n13 Coverage by the four divisional offices will be as follows: (i) Belgaum: Badami, Ilkal, Jamkhandi, and Rabkavi-Banhatti \n(Bagalkot District), and Belgaum, Gokak, and Nippani (Belgaum District); (ii) Bellary: Bellary and Hospet (Bellary \nDistrict), Gangavathi and Koppal (Koppal District), and Raichur and Sindhanoor (Raichur District); (iii) Dharwad: \nChamarajnagar (Chamarajnagar District), Davangere (Davangere District), Hubli-Dharwad (Dharwad District), Gadag-\nBetageri (Gadag-Betageri District), and Haveri and Ranebennur (Haveri District); (iv) Gulbarga: Basavakalyan and \nBidar (Bidar District); Bijapur (Bijapur District), and Gulbarga, Shahabad and Yadgir (Gulbarga District). The divisional \noffice in Dharwad will be attached to the PMU\u2019s regional office. The program consultant for Dharwad will therefore will \nperform some additional functions relative to the other three program consultants. \n14 The divisional program directors will be officers from the Karnataka Administrative Service or the Karnataka Municipal \nAdministrative Service. \n15 The initially selected Investment Program ULBs are (i) 4 city corporations (Belgaum, Bellary, Gulbarga, and Hubli-\nDharwad); (ii) 14 city municipality councils (Bidar, Bijapur, Chamarajnagar, Davangere, Gadag-Betageri, Gangavathi, \nGokak, Haveri, Hospet, Koppal, Nippani, Rabkavi-Banhatti, Raichur, and Ranebennur); (iii) 6 town municipalities \n(Basavakalyan, Ilkal, Jamkhandi, Shahabad, Sindhanoor, and Yadgir;) and (iv) 1 town panchayat, which is the smallest \nULB category of the four (Badami). \n16 Even though the provision of basic urban infrastructure and services, including water supply, became a mandate of the \nULBs under the 74th Amendment Act to the Constitution of India, most ULBs in north Karnataka have yet to develop \nsufficient capacity to carry out this mandate. In Karnataka, expertise in this sector has been accumulated primarily \nwithin the KUWSDB  because, under the act that established it, this agency had monopoly power in relation to the \nplanning, preparation, and execution of all water supply and sewerage asset creation schemes above a certain value. \nIn addition, bulk water supply schemes under the Investment Program cross ULB boundaries. Considering these \nfactors, it was agreed between GoK and ADB to include the KUWSDB as an implementing agency for bulk water supply \nschemes on behalf of concerned ULBs. From a contractual viewpoint, contracts for bulk water supply schemes will be \nsigned between the KUWSDB and the contractor, while ones for water supply distribution schemes and sewerage \nschemes will be signed between individual ULBs and the contractor. In addition, for PSP schemes, tripartite contracts \nwill be signed by the ULB, the contractor, and the KUIDFC.  \n ", "    11 \nDepartment,  the  secretary  for  Municipalities and  Urban  Development  Authorities  of  the Urban \nDevelopment Department, the secretary for expenditure of the Finance Department, the director of \nthe  Directorate  of  Municipal  Administration,  and  the  managing  director  of  the  KUIDFC  (the \ncommittee secretary). The empowered committee will meet every quarter to review the performance \nof  the  Investment  Program  and  decide  on  major  issues,  such  as  counterpart  funding, \nimplementation  bottlenecks,  land  disputes,  and  special  procurement.  Furthermore,  district-level \nprogram  steering  committees  have  been  formed  in  each  of  the  13  districts  to  monitor  the \nimplementation of subprojects and institutional reforms in the Investment Program ULBs, as well as \nto coordinate between various agencies regarding approvals and clearances. Each district-level \nprogram steering committee, which reports to the executive program director, is made up of deputy \ncommissioner  of  the  district  (who  serves  as  the  chair),  divisional  program  director  from  the \nconcerned divisional office, municipal commissioners or chief officers of the Investment Program \nULBs,  and  presidents  or  chairs  of  the  Investment  Program  ULBs.  Appendix  7  shows  the \norganizational arrangements for implementation of the Investment Program. \n \n2.  Subproject Appraisal and Approval \n48.  Identification, appraisal, and approval of subprojects under the Investment Program will \nfollow the steps outlined in the following paragraphs. \n \n49.  Subproject Identification and Selection. Twenty-five ULBs have been initially selected for \nthe Investment Program. With the assistance of the KUIDFC, each of these ULBs has prepared a \nCLIP that identifies the gaps between current and target levels of urban infrastructure, estimates the \ninterventions required to fill the gaps, and proposes subprojects in components A\u2013E to be funded \nunder the Investment Program. The 25 Investment Program ULBs sent the CLIPs through the \nKUIDFC to the empowered committee, which subsequently approved them. ADB then reviewed the \nCLIPs. Any additional ULB that wishes to be included in the Investment Program will have to follow \nthe same procedures. All the subprojects proposed for funding should meet the subproject selection \ncriteria (Appendix 3). ADB will also review the CLIPs of additional ULBs to ensure their compliance \nwith the provisions of the framework financing agreement. \n \n50.  Subproject Appraisal and Approval and Submission of PFRs. The KUIDFC will be \nresponsible for detailed appraisal of the subprojects with the assistance of the program consultants. \nThe KUIDFC will prepare a summary subproject appraisal report based on the CLIPs that will \ninclude the rationale for each subproject, the scope and components, a technical description and \nanalysis, the cost estimates and financing plan, an environmental assessment, a resettlement plan, \nan  indigenous  peoples  development  plan,  and  the  implementation  arrangements  along  with \nfinancial, economic, and institutional analyses. All the summary subproject appraisal reports will be \nsent to ADB for review and approval in a format agreed on by GoK and ADB. If necessary, ADB \nmay advise the KUIDFC to modify the subproject appraisal reports. Following ADB approval, and \nsubject to any modifications and measures required by ADB, the KUIDFC and GoK will prepare \nPFRs for ADB financing. PFRs will be formally submitted to ADB for further processing through the \nGovernment. \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n51.  The Investment Program will be implemented over a period of 8 years from 2006 to 2015 \n(Appendix 8). Advance contracting for first loan will be undertaken before the effectiveness of the \nfirst loan. Civil works and equipment purchases included under the first loan, in particular, civil \nworks for fully appraised subprojects for three ULBs (Haveri, Hospet, and Raichur) are expected to \ncommence  immediately  on  effectiveness  of  the  first  loan  by  taking  advantage  of  advance \ncontracting and retroactive financing. \n \n4.  Procurement \n52.  Procurement of all goods and services under the Investment Program will be undertaken in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines as amended from time to time. Contracts for civil \nworks estimated to cost $10 million or more will be procured using international competitive bidding \n(ICB) procedures. Contracts estimated to cost less than $10 million will be procured under national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to ADB. To the extent possible, the procurement \nof goods will be grouped into packages larger than $1 million to be suitable for ICB procedures. \nMiscellaneous goods that cannot be grouped into larger contracts and cost less than $1 million per \n ", "12   \ncontract will be procured through limited international bidding or NCB procedures. Minor items that \ncost  less  than  the  equivalent  of  $100,000  per  contract  may  be  purchased  through  shopping \nprocedures. Appendix 9 shows the procurement plan and indicative procurement packaging. The \nAppraisal Mission, with the KUIDFC, reviewed GoK\u2019s standard bidding documents and procurement \nprocedures that were used for NCB (civil works and goods) and limited international bidding (goods) \nunder ADB\u2019s previous loan and found them to be consistent with ADB requirements. The KUIDFC \nwill furnish further modifications it requires, together with justifications, to ADB for its no objection. \nNecessary provisions and detailed procedures for the Investment Program will be incorporated in \nthe facility administration memorandum.17 \n \n53.  The  KUIDFC  has  proposed  carrying  out  the  tendering  for  the  subprojects  under  the \nInvestment Program electronically, as permitted under the Information Technology Act of India \n(2000). A demonstration was conducted during the Appraisal Mission, and the proposed system \nwas found to be generally acceptable to ADB (http://www.tenderwizard.com). E-tendering for the \nInvestment Program will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines and E-bidding Requirements for \nMDB [Multilateral Development Banks] Loans, Grants, and Credits. The program consultants will \ndevelop specifics of e-tendering to be adopted with required customization, which will be submitted \nto ADB for its no objection. E-tendering should start with simple contracts that are easy to define \nand specify, for example, water meter procurement, to be expanded further in consultation with \nADB. \n \n54.  Subprojects under the PSP modality (the PBDPS and PBMCs) will be procured, in principle, \nthrough  performance-based  procurement  procedures  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines.  The  Use  of  a  two-stage  bidding  procedure  to  be  preceded  by  prequalification  is \nproposed for recruiting private contractors under these modalities. For tendering PBDPS contracts, \nthe first stage will involve an evaluation of technical proposals, which, if necessary, will be revised \nto fit specified requirements by means of clarification between the employer and the bidders. The \nfirst-stage technical proposal clarification is to be followed by the issuance of amended bidding \ndocuments and the submission of final technical proposals and priced bids in the second stage. The \nselection of the contractor will be based on the minimum annuity payment, which also reflects the \nlifetime cost approach. More details of the proposed procedures are shown in Appendix 4. \n \n55.  PBDPS contracts account for the capital investment segment for initial civil works and the 10 \nyears\u2019 O&M segment. Thus the ICB and NCB threshold of $10 million will be applied to the \nestimated capital investment cost component. Notwithstanding this arrangement, the KUIDFC will \nstart procurement of the first PBDPS contract for the water supply and sewerage component under \nICB procedures regardless of the estimated cost for the capital investment segment. All PBDPS \ncontracts are subject to prior approval by ADB for subprojects and a full procurement review \nprocess regardless of the estimated costs of their capital investment segments and whether ICB or \nNCB procedures are adopted. \n \n56.  For PBDPS contracts, payment can be in local currency. Payment in local currency is \nsensible, because revenues for these subprojects will be in local currency and the contracts are \nsubstantially longer than ordinary civil works contracts. Furthermore, private contractors, including \ninternationally affiliated companies, present at the PSP workshop conducted during the Appraisal \nMission did not object to this proposal,. This possibility should be clearly emphasized in the bidding \ndocuments. \n \n57.  The recruitment of management contractors will be carried out under ADB's Guidelines on \nthe  Use  of  Consultants  as  amended  from  time  to  time.  Like  PBDPS  contracts,  PBMCs  for \nsubprojects are required to have ADB\u2019s prior approval and to undergo a full procurement review \nprocess. For the recruitment of management contractors, ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures  will  generally  be  followed  with  suitable  modifications.  A  two-stage  procedure  is \nproposed. The first stage will be for the preparation of a shortlist of well-qualified potential bidders \namong  those  who  submitted  expressions  of  interest  in  response  to  an  advertisement.  The \nshortlisted companies or consortia will then be invited to submit second-stage proposals containing \ndetailed technical plans for the improvements to and operation of the water supply and sewerage \n                                                 \n17 In  particular,  the  facility  administration  memorandum  will  incorporate  provisions  for  smoothly  and  expeditiously \ncompleting the balance of works in the case of failure of initial civil works contracts. \n ", "    13 \nsystems together with financial proposals in line with the request for proposals documents. More \ndetails of the proposed procedures are shown in Appendix 5. With ADB assistance, the bridging TA \nconsultants (footnote 8) will develop respective sets of requests for proposals and draft contract \ndocuments for the PBDPS and PBMC modalities based on lessons from global experiences with \nsimilar contracting approaches. The bridging TA consultants will be recruited under TA 4814\u2013IND. \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n58.  Consultants will be selected and engaged using ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection \nprocedures and/or least cost selection procedures in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants. Consulting services will be provided in five packages. Four national firms will be \nengaged as the program consultants, corresponding to the four divisional offices under the PMU. \nThe program consultants will assist the respective PMU offices with overall project management \nand implementation and will help the implementing agencies carry out detailed engineering design, \nprocurement,  and  quality  control.  The  program  consultants  for  the  divisional  office  based  in \nDharwad will serve both the PMU regional office and the divisional office. Thus this program \nconsultant team will include a transaction adviser (or advisers) (6 person-months) with both Indian \nand international experience in PSP to facilitate the recruitment of PBDPS and PBMC contractors, \nparticularly in the water supply and sewerage subsectors, for the entire Investment Program. The \nestimated staffing requirement for the four program consultant packages is about 1,700 person-\nmonths. A full technical proposal will be required for firms bidding for the program consultant \npackages. The KUIDFC has proposed the use of a single shortlist for the four program consultant \npackages. Any one firm on the shortlist will be allowed to submit bids for a maximum of any two of \nthe four program consultant packages and may be awarded a maximum of two packages based on \nthe evaluation of its bids. This selection mechanism is almost the same as that used under the two \nprevious ADB-assisted projects. For this selection arrangement, a shortlist of six firms is deemed \nappropriate to ensure sufficient competition for each of the four packages. Performance-based \ncontract is used for the program consultants and hence payments to the program consultants are \nlinked to clearly defined deliverables as shown in Supplementary Appendix P. \n \n59.  One national firm will be engaged as the program performance monitoring system (PPMS) \nconsultant to help the PMU generate baseline data, provide midcourse corrections, and track the \nInvestment Program\u2019s benefits. The estimated staffing requirement for the PPMS will be 80 person-\nmonths (national). A biodata proposal will be used for selecting the consultants for the PPMS. \nOutline terms of reference for consulting packages are in Supplementary Appendix P. \n \n6.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n60.  ADB management has approved (i) the use of advance action to recruit consultants and to \nprocure  goods  and  civil  works;  and  (ii) the  request  to  seek  the  approval  of  ADB\u2019s  Board  for \nretroactive financing for each of the individual loans under the MFF. Advance action is necessary to \nexpedite  start-up  of  the  Investment  Program  and  its  continuous,  smooth  implementation,  and \nretroactive financing will ease GoK\u2019s budgetary constraints, especially during the start-up period. \nRetroactive financing covers up to 20% of each individual loan amount for eligible expenditures \nincurred during the 12 months before the signing of the corresponding loan agreement.18 The \nGovernment  and  GoK  have  been  advised  that  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing does not constitute a commitment to finance the relevant expenditures under \nthe Investment Program. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n61.  Each  PFR  will  result  in  a  separate  loan  agreement,  which  will  describe  the  detailed \ndisbursement arrangements agreed between the Government and ADB. Loan disbursements will \nbe  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement  Handbook  and  Interim  Guidelines  for \nDisbursement Operations, LIBOR-Based Loan Product, as updated from time to time. Each loan \nwill have its own imprest account. GoK will also establish a second-generation imprest account for \neach loan, if necessary or required, in a non interest-bearing current account with a commercial \n                                                 \n18 This is in accordance with ADB. 2005. Cost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditures for Asian Development Bank \nFinancing: A New Approach. Manila. \n ", "14   \nbank. The amount at any given time in the imprest account and the second-generation imprest \naccount shall be equivalent to 6 months of estimated expenditures or 10% of the related loan \namount, whichever is lower. The imprest account and the second-generation imprest account will \nbe established, managed, and liquidated in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement Handbook \nas  updated  from  time  to  time.  The  statement  of  expenditures  will  be  used  to  reimburse  any \nindividual payments not exceeding a certain amount to be determined for each loan. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n62.  The KUIDFC has a satisfactory financial management and accounting system. Its Finance \nDivision has adequate resources, including a financial management manual that clearly documents \nits  financial  and  accounting  policies  and  procedures.  The  KUIDFC  follows  an  accrual-based, \ndouble-entry bookkeeping system, and its accounting standards are those promulgated by the \nInstitute of Chartered Accountants of India. Its account books are computerized and are maintained \nby project and by funding agency. The audit of accounting of he GoK and KUIDFC are carried out \nby  the  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General  of  India.  The  Internal  Audit  Division  of  the  KUIDFC \ncoordinates  its  annual  statutory  audit  of  financial  statements  to  be  carried  out  by  chartered \naccountants appointed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India as prescribed under Article \n619  of  the  Companies  Act  (1956).  More  details  on  the  KUIDFC\u2019s  accounting  and  auditing \nprocedures are presented in Supplementary Appendix A. \n \n63.  For the Investment Program, the PMU and the implementing agencies will establish and \nmaintain separate accounts and records adequate to identify the goods and services financed from \nthe loan proceeds, the expenditures incurred from the Investment Program components and their \nsubprojects under each individual project, and the use of local funds under each individual project. \nIndependent  auditors  will  audit  these  accounts  and  related  financial  statements  annually  in \naccordance with international auditing standards. Within 9 months of the end of each fiscal year, \nGoK will submit consolidated annual audited reports and related financial statements for each \nindividual project to ADB. The auditors\u2019 opinion of that part of the examination relating to the imprest \naccounts and statements of expenditure should be separately set out in the auditors\u2019 opinion.  \n \n64.  The  PMU  is  responsible  for  providing  ADB  with  quarterly  progress  reports  on  the \nimplementation of each individual project within 45 days of the end of each quarter. The progress \nreports will cover progress made during the period of review; changes to the implementation \nschedule, if any; problems or difficulties encountered and remedial actions taken; and work to be \nundertaken and subprojects and/or components to be proposed for financing in the coming quarter. \nThe  reports  will  also  include  a  summary  financial  account  for  each  implementing  agency, \nexpenditures to date, and a report on benefit monitoring. Based on the quarterly progress reports, \nADB  will  prepare  annual  implementation  progress  reports  to  be  submitted  to  the  Board  each \nDecember. The PMU will submit to ADB a project completion report within 3 months of physical \ncompletion of the subprojects financed under each loan and an MFF completion report within 3 \nmonths of physical completion of the subprojects under the MFF. These reports will describe the \ndetails of implementation, costs, monitoring and evaluation results, problems encountered and \nactions taken, and other relevant information that ADB may request.  \n \n9.  Anticorruption Policy and Governance Measures \n65.  ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to and discussed with the KUIDFC. Consistent \nwith its commitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right \nto investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive \npractices relating to the Investment Program. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption  policy  are  included  in  the  loan  regulations  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the \nInvestment Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment \nProgram shall include provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit and examine the records and \naccounts of the KUIDFC and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Investment Program. \n \n66.  The  KUIDFC's  strong  financial  management  capacity  that  it  gained  through  the \nimplementation of two earlier ADB projects is expected to mitigate the risks of corruption under the \nInvestment Program. The adoption of the PSP modality, which would bring in competent private \nparties who will be held accountable for clearly identified outputs in a comprehensive manner, is \nexpected to further mitigate the risks of corruption. Furthermore, all the PSP contracts will be \n ", "    15 \nsubject to technical auditing by independent auditors. GoK\u2019s NNP, which is to be supported under \nthe Investment Program, is designed to improve governance at the ULB level, in particular, by \nintroducing transparent accounting systems and publishing municipal information on ULBs\u2019 web \nsites.19 The ULB web sites provide access to the public grievance redress system, which can be \nused  for  handling  grievances  related  to  the  Investment  Program.  GoK  will  disclose  various \ninformation about the Investment Program on the KUIDFC web site and the respective ULB web \nsites as appropriate, including procurement-related information, financial statements, and physical \nprogress. With regard to procurement, the web sites will disclose lists of participating bidders, \nnames of winning bidders, basic details of the bidding procedures adopted, contract values, and \nlists  of  goods  and  services  procured.  In  addition,  the  e-tendering  proposed  for  selected \nprocurement is expected to enhance fair, transparent, and efficient bidding procedures. \n \n10.  Program Performance Monitoring System \n67.  The PMU will ensure that a PPMS satisfactory to ADB is established within 3 months of the \neffectiveness of the first loan under the MFF. The PPMS will monitor and evaluate the performance \nof the Investment Program, as well as of subprojects under each loan, including key impact and \noutcome indicators and associated assumptions with corresponding target dates. For subprojects \nunder the PBPDS and PBMC modalities, key performance indicators satisfactory to ADB will be \ndeveloped during the preparation of requests for proposals and draft contract documents for each \nsubproject. To monitor the key performance indicators, for each PDBPS contract and PBMC, the \nKUIDFC will propose three program consultant teams not directly involved in the geographical area \nconcerned as independent auditor candidates. The private contractor concerned will be allowed to \nselect a preferred candidate from the list of the three that will be employed by the KUIDFC. \n \n11.  Investment Program Review \n68.  Based on a review of quarterly progress reports, ADB and GoK representatives will meet as \nrequired to discuss the progress of the Investment Program under each loan, any changes to \nimplementation arrangements, or remedial measures required to be undertaken to achieve the \noverall objectives of specific subprojects and components and of the overall Investment Program. \n \n69.  In addition to regular reviews, including a midterm review for each loan, a detailed midterm \nreview of the Investment Program will be undertaken within a certain period of the effective date as \nagreed under the first loan agreement by ADB and the Government. The midterm review will \ninclude  a  detailed  evaluation  of  the  scope  of  the  Investment  Program,  implementation \narrangements,  any  outstanding  issues,  environment,  resettlement  and  other  safeguard  issues, \nachievement of scheduled targets, progress with PSP contracts, and other issues, as appropriate. \n \nIV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n1.  Economic Analysis \n70.  The economic analysis reviewed the following 10 areas for the Investment Program: (i) the \nrationale for government involvement; (ii) the goals of the HPC report\u2019s investment plan; (iii) the \nsector development plan; (iv) the associated economic policies; (v) the economic risks; (vi) GoK\u2019s \ncapacity; (vii) the fiscal impacts; (viii) GoK\u2019s commitment; (ix) the coordination of foreign aid; and \n(x) the conditions attached to the loans. Supplementary Appendix F presents the detailed economic \nanalysis. The economic rationale for government intervention is sound, as the Investment Program \nsupports only the ULBs\u2019 constitutionally mandated functions, which are related to basic public \nservices characterized by monopolistic conditions, externality management, and protection of public \ngoods.  The  goals  of  accelerating  economic  growth  in  north  Karnataka  and  reducing  regional \nimbalances within the state are well conceived as the state\u2019s priority through wide consultation. The \nInvestment Program is the least-cost approach to realizing that goal by focusing investments in the \nurban sector, as urban areas drive the region\u2019s economic growth by attracting private investment \nand industry. The economic viability of subprojects is ensured by applying economic selection \ncriteria  developed  for  the  Investment  Program.  The  Investment  Program  fits  in  well  with  and \n                                                 \n19 Each ULB\u2019s web site is operational with the support of the eGovernments Foundation. \n ", "16   \ncomplements  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  promote  performance-  and  reform-linked  urban \ninfrastructure development in India, as embodied in its 10th five-year plan, in the Jawarharlal Nehru \nNational  Urban  Renewal  Mission,  and  in  the  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  in  Small  and \nMedium Towns. The Investment Program seeks financing from different sources, including central \nGovernment fund, state funds, and World Bank loans. In particular, the World Bank\u2019s Karnataka \nMunicipal Reform Project supports the urban development plans of ULBs that are not covered \nunder the ADB financing in a modality consistent with the Investment Program. As a nodal agency \nfor urban infrastructure projects financed by GoK, the KUIDFC is capable of coordinating multiple \nprojects at the state level to make efficient use of available resources. \n \n2.  Financial Analysis \n71.  The financial operating plans for all 25 initially identified Investment Program ULBs examine \nwhether the ULBs can absorb the respective subprojects in relation to equity contributions, O&M \ncosts, and debt-service repayments. According to the financial operating plans, 13 of the 25 ULBs \nhave  demonstrated  that  their  municipal  cash  flows  would  be  sufficient  to  meet  the  additional \nexpenditures  resulting  from  the  Investment  Program,  as  their  projected  closing  balances  are \npositive.  The  other  12  should  propose  a  financial  improvement  action  plan  for  sustaining  the \nimproved urban services resulting from the Investment Program before they can start implementing \nthe respective subprojects. The financial analysis is presented in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \n72.  Financial  projections  were  also  undertaken  for  revenue-generating  subprojects  in  three \nrepresentative ULBs to examine the financial viability of individual subprojects. Tariff levels are \ncurrently low, but raising tariffs substantially before realizing actual improvements in urban services \nis difficult. Hence the financial internal rates of return for water supply and sewerage subprojects \nare estimated to be lower than the weighted average cost of capital of 2.5% for all three ULBs. GoK \nis, however, committed to restructuring water tariffs and introducing sewerage tariffs, and has \nalready initiated the necessary studies and surveys. In particular, ADB will help GoK develop \nsewerage  tariffs  for  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  under  the  bridging  TA.  The  financial \nsustainability of subprojects in each ULB is expected to rely on ULBs\u2019 general revenue mobilization \nefforts, especially property tax increases, which will be assisted by the Investment Program. \n \n3.  Poverty Reduction and Social Development \n73.  The Investment Program will result in wider access to and sustainable improved quality of \nurban infrastructure and services in Investment Program ULBs. The resulting benefits are upgraded \nprovision of basic needs, enhanced living conditions, and improved public health. Baseline surveys \nindicate that the poor suffer more than the average population from poor-quality urban infrastructure \nand services in north Karnataka.20 Benefits from the sanitation component are expected to accrue \nto households connected to the sewerage network. Networks will be provided in densely built-up \ncore and unserved or underserved areas. Sewerage networks will reach the boundaries of slum \nareas, which will enable connection by a large number of households and provide sewered, low-\ncost toilets. The benefits to poor households from the urban transport component will be derived \nfrom employment generation and access. Water supply will benefit all Investment Program ULB \npopulations. The Investment Program will also result in broader benefits to the poor, including \neconomic growth and employment generation. In addition, the slum improvement component will \nresult in community development in poor areas. The summary poverty reduction and social strategy \nis in Appendix 10. \n \n74.  Community  development  is  a  key  objective  of  the  slum  improvement  component. \nCommunity  development  programs  in  poor  communities,  to  be  implemented  through \nnongovernment organizations, will focus on health and sanitation awareness, low-cost sanitation \ninfrastructure,  and  self-help  groups  for  women.  The  programs  are  hinged  on  community \n                                                 \n20\n Fewer than 30% of households in north Karnataka have access to water connections, and in slum areas, the figure is \nless than 10%. More than 75% of slum dwellers in north Karnataka ULBs such as Bellary, Gagad-Betageri, Gulbarga, \nKoppal, and Rabkavi-Banhatti  and 45% to 60% in Badami, Basavakalyan, Davangere, Gokak, Raichur, and Yadgir \ndepend on standposts. The slum populations also receive lower water pressure delivered less frequently and for shorter \ndurations compared with the general population. More than 85% of slum households completely lack access to safe \nsanitation. Slum households in 16 of the 25 Investment Program ULBs reported a lack of access to underground \ndrainage connections. Surveys also show that more than 60% of slum dwellers in the Investment Program ULBs report \npoor access to roads. \n ", "    17 \nparticipation. A participation strategy is provided in Supplementary Appendix H. Self-help groups for \nwomen will bring positive benefits to poor women in poor areas, where the percentage of female-\nheaded households is disproportionately larger compared with the overall average. The gender \nstrategy presented in Supplementary Appendix I focuses on women\u2019s participation to maximize the \nInvestment Program\u2019s beneficial impacts on women. Appendix 11 presents a gender action plan. \nThe Investment Program\u2019s benefits for women are expected to include a reduction of the burden \nentailed in collecting water, health benefits, and employment opportunities. \n \n4.  Social and Environmental Safeguards \n75.  Social. The KUIDFC prepared short resettlement plans for sample subprojects in three \nInvestment Program ULBs (Haveri, Hospet, and Raichur) following ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary \nresettlement, the resettlement framework for the Investment Program, and applicable policies and \nlaws of the Government and GoK. Draft short resettlement plans are in Supplementary Appendixes \nJ1 to J3. Subprojects are not expected to result in significant land acquisition and resettlement. \nCareful  subproject  site  and  alignment  selection  will  minimize  the  amount  of  land  acquisition \nrequired, and GoK land will be used to the extent possible. The draft short resettlement plans show \nthat 13, 12, and 14 hectares, respectively, will be permanently acquired for the Haveri, Hospet, and \nRaichur sewage treatment plants. This acquisition will affect a total of 29 households in the three \nULBs.  No  permanent  land  acquisition  is  required  for  water  supply  subprojects,  which  will  be \nundertaken  in  existing  facilities,  or  for  urban  road  improvements,  which  will  be  confined  to \nimprovements to the riding surface. While temporary land acquisition is not expected for any of the \nsubprojects,  this  will  be  re-examined  during  detailed  engineering  design  of  water  supply  and \nsewerage  network  components.  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  policies  and  requirements  on \nresettlement  of  the  Government,  GoK  and  ADB,  the  KUIDFC  has  formulated  a  resettlement \nframework  to  guide  the  implementation  of  future  subprojects.  A  summary  of  the  resettlement \nframework is in Appendix 12 and the resettlement framework is in Supplementary Appendix K. \n \n76.  The Investment Program provides social benefits through improvements of and expanded \naccess  to  urban  infrastructure  and  services  and  enhances  the  potential  for  investments  and \neconomic growth in poorer districts of north Karnataka. Social assessments undertaken for sample \nsubprojects  do  not  indicate  any  adverse  impacts  on  vulnerable  groups,  including  indigenous \npeoples. The KUIDFC has formulated an indigenous peoples development framework to ensure \nthat appropriate indigenous peoples development plans or specific actions will be undertaken that \nenable equal sharing of Investment Program benefits should a future subproject affect indigenous \npeoples (Supplementary Appendix L). \n \n77.  Environmental. The KUIDFC has prepared initial environmental examinations (IEEs) for \nthree sample subprojects in the Investment Program ULBs of Haveri, Hospet, and Raichur in line \nwith ADB\u2019s environment policy. The IEEs show that subprojects will result in net environmental \nbenefits, including (i) improved quality of drinking water from water supply investments; (ii) improved \nsurface and groundwater quality; (iii) improved public health as a result of sanitation and drainage \ninvestments;  (iv) reduced  flooding  as  a  result  of  drainage  investments;  (v) reduced  volume  of \nsuspended particulates in the air as a result of improved roads; and (vi) increased social benefits \nfrom community participation, slum improvement, and nonmunicipal infrastructure investments. The \nsalient points of the IEEs are summarized in Appendix 13 (the actual IEEs are in Supplementary \nAppendixes M1 to M3). \n \n78.  The Investment Program will not generate any significant adverse environmental impacts. \nPotential adverse environmental impacts are largely temporary and localized and can be addressed \nthrough subproject design and mitigation measures. The IEEs contain environmental monitoring \nplans that identify monitoring parameters and the agencies responsible for ensuring that mitigation \nmeasures are undertaken. The IEEs conclude that no further assessment of environmental impacts \nis required for sample subprojects. To ensure compliance with the environmental guidelines and \nrequirements  of  the  Government,  GoK  and  ADB,  the  KUIDFC  has  formulated  environmental \nassessment and review procedures to guide the implementation of future subprojects. Should a \ncategory A or B (sensitive) subproject be prepared, a Summary Environmental Impact Assessment \nor Summary Initial Environmental Examination will be prepared and made available to the public \n120 days in advance of subproject approval in line with ADB\u2019s implementation procedures for sector \nloans. The environmental assessment of sector impacts, summary IEEs for sample subprojects, \n ", "18   \nenvironmental  criteria  for  subproject  selection,  and  environmental  assessment  and  review \nprocedures are in Supplementary Appendix N. \nB.  Risks \n79.  The  effectiveness  of  the  infrastructure  to  be  developed  under  the  Investment  Program \ndepends on the level of ownership of and commitment by the Investment Program ULBs. The ULBs \nmust be committed to institutional change and financial reforms, especially the NNP. Offering ULBs \nmore favorable loan conditions based on the number of core reforms adopted will mitigate some \nrisks, but at the same time, the ULBs must continue to demonstrate the political will to increase \ntariffs to achieve full cost recovery within a reasonable time frame. A key risk is that Investment \nProgram ULBs may fail to manage and maintain the newly acquired assets properly and may be \ntempted to minimize costs through inappropriate operations. GoK is mitigating this risk by launching \na well-prepared human resources policy designed to abolish redundant and/or antiquated positions \nand appoint well-qualified staff through competitive selection procedures. \n \n80.  Long-term contractual relationships, such as the PBDPS and PBMC modalities, involve \nrisks. Each of these risks carries with it a cost to the contracting parties, and these costs are \nultimately borne by Investment Program beneficiaries in the form of tariffs or taxes. As such, careful \nattention to risk mitigation measures can help ensure that PSP arrangements result in improved \nservice delivery at the lowest possible cost to Investment Program beneficiaries. The allocation of \nrisk for a subproject will depend on specific subproject conditions, including the type and location of \nthe subproject, the services to be provided, and the negotiating positions of the parties involved. At \npreliminary  consultations  with  prospective  private  contractors  at  a  workshop  held  during  the \nAppraisal Mission on 12 September 2005 (Supplementary Appendix E), the private contractors \nidentified the risks that need to be addressed in the design of PSP subprojects as follows: \n(i)  force majeure risks; \n(ii)  revenue risks, in particular, the need for escalation clauses that would allow the \nprivate contractors\u2019 remuneration to be adjusted for inflation and the need to ensure \npayments to the private contractors from the ULBs; \n(iii)  political risks, in particular, assurances that GoK is strongly committed to its stated \npolicies; \n(iv)  construction  risks,  in  particular,  delays  caused  by  the  failure  to  complete  land \nacquisition prior to the onset of construction; \n(v)  financial risks, in particular, with regard to foreign currency exposure; and \n(vi)  operating risks, specifically, the reliability of water sources in the case of water and \nsewerage projects. \n \n81.  Based  on  lessons  from  global  experiences  with  similar  contracting  approaches \n(Supplementary  Appendix  E),  identifiable  risks  inherent  in  PSP  arrangements,  including  those \noutlined  above,  will  be  mitigated  through  careful  design  of  both  types  of  contracts  and  the \nunderlying legal and regulatory regime. The remaining risks will be allocated, to the extent possible, \nto those parties best able to bear them. This principle will be adopted in developing PSP contracts \nand associated bidding documents. \n \n82.  A number of Investment Program ULBs will continue to depend on water sources which are \nnot under their control but from which sufficient quantities of water must be made available for \nthem. Thus one risk is the impact of potential conflicting upstream demands on water sources and \nanother  is  upstream  pollution.  The  success  of  the  Investment  Program  also  depends  on  the \nsuccessful rehabilitation of existing water treatment, transmission, and distribution systems and of \nexisting  sewerage  systems.  As  these  assets  continue  to  deteriorate  with  age,  the  level  of \ninvestment required to achieve the stated objectives may increase. The risk of underinvestment is \nincreased as a result of the current limited knowledge of the systems because of the lack of original \nplans, as-built drawings and operational data. Improving the level of system understanding will be a \nkey task for the program consultants. In addition, delays in land acquisition, where undertaken, \ncould result in implementation delays. \n ", "    19 \nV.  ASSURANCES \n83.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and GoK have given the following \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the framework financing agreement, and will be \nincorporated in the individual loan agreements as applicable, subject to any amendments to be \nmutually agreed by the Government and ADB. \n(i)  GoK will ensure that sufficient counterpart funds are made available from its budget \nfor each fiscal year in a timely manner to cover (a) its contribution, and (b) those of \nthe implementing agencies for the subprojects under components A, B, C, D, and E. \n(ii)  GoK will ensure that adequate funds for the O&M of project facilities created under \nindividual subprojects will be provided for appropriate implementing agencies during \nand after subproject completion through budgetary allocations or other means. \n(iii)  The Government will make available to GoK the proceeds of the financing provided \nby ADB. GoK commits to bearing the foreign exchange risk of such proceeds. \n(iv)  GoK will relend the loan proceeds to the implementing agencies through the KUIDFC \nunder appropriate relending arrangements acceptable to ADB. \n(v)  GoK  will  ensure  that  contractual  documents  under  the  PBDPS  and/or  PBMC \narrangements are provided for ADB for prior review and approval before their use for \nindividual subprojects. \n(vi)  GoK will ensure that necessary provisions are made for each PSP contractor to meet \nthe contractual obligations of GoK and of the pertinent Investment Program ULB. \nGoK will ensure that the PSP fund that has been established is operationalized and \nthat  sufficient  funds  are  provided  to  and  maintained  in  the  fund  to  mitigate \nnonpayment risks for PSP contractors. \n(vii)  GoK will ensure that all land and rights-of-way required for any of the subprojects are \nmade  available  in  a  timely  manner;  that  compensation  at  replacement  value  is \nprovided prior to the award of relevant civil works contracts; and that involuntary \nresettlement, including relocation, is carried out in accordance with the resettlement \nframework  and  resettlement  plans  agreed  upon  between  GoK  and  ADB,  the \nGovernment\u2019s national policy on resettlement and rehabilitation, and ADB\u2019s policy on \nInvoluntary Resettlement. A resettlement plan will be prepared for every subproject \ninvolving land acquisition or resettlement, including relocation, and will be submitted \nto  ADB  for  review  and  approval  prior  to  the  award  of  any  related  civil  works \ncontracts. For sample subprojects, updated resettlement plans will be provided to \nADB for review and approval following detailed engineering design and prior to the \naward  of  civil  works  contracts.  Similarly,  revised  resettlement  plans  based  on \ndetailed designs for all subprojects will also be provided for ADB approval prior to the \naward of related civil works contracts. \n(viii)  GoK will ensure that subprojects will, as far as possible, have a minimal impact on \nindigenous peoples. If an impact is anticipated, GoK will ensure that the subprojects \nare carried out in accordance with the indigenous peoples development framework \nagreed  upon  between  GoK  and  ADB  and  will  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on \nIndigenous Peoples. \n(ix)  GoK will ensure that subprojects will be carried out in accordance with the gender \naction plan (Appendix 11) and ADB\u2019s policy on gender and development. \n(x)  GoK will ensure that the design, construction, operation, and implementation of all \nsubproject facilities is carried out in accordance with the environmental assessment \nand review procedures and IEEs for sample subprojects agreed upon between GoK \nand  ADB  and  complies  with  the  environmental  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment and GoK, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy. Any adverse environmental \nimpacts arising from the construction, operation, and implementation of subproject \nfacilities  will  be  minimized  by  implementing  the  environmental  mitigation  and \nmanagement  measures  and  other  recommendations  specified  in  environmental \nassessment  reports  (e.g.,  Initial  Environmental  Examinations,  and  Environmental \nImpact  Assessments).  GoK  will  ensure  that  environmental  requirements  are \nincorporated in bidding documents and civil works contracts. \n(xi)  GoK will conduct surveys under the bridging TA referred to in paragraph 37, to \ndetermine the real volumetric water tariff by measuring the actual amounts of water \nsupplied to 3 ULBs to be selected by the KUIDFC. \n ", "20   \n(xii)  GoK will ensure that for each of the Investment Program ULBs receiving funds under \nthe loan, the (nominal) base volumetric water tariff will be increased to the real \ncurrent volumetric tariff per m3 and that the tariff schedule will be changed zone by \nzone or for the related town, as feasible, upon completion of the related water supply \nsubproject, from the (un-metered) monthly flat-rate to volumetric metered tariff with \nthe lifeline block set at 8 m3 for which the rate shall not be less than the flat-rate. \nUpon completion of the studies currently being carried out by consultants under the \nWorld  Bank-supported  Karnataka  Urban  Water  Sector  Improvement  Project \n(KUWASIP), and by the bridging TA consultants, the water tariffs of the Investment \nProgram ULBs will be reviewed and revised based on recommendations of these \nstudies. Recommendations to the Investment Program ULBs will be firmed up by the \nmid-term review of the Investment Program. \n(xiii)  For subprojects consisting of sewerage provision, sewerage tariffs will be introduced \nby GoK. The appropriate levels of sewerage tariffs for the Investment Program ULBs \nwill be agreed between GoK and ADB upon completion of studies currently being \ncarried  out  by  consultants  under  the  World  Bank-supported  KUWASIP,  and \nsubsequently  upon  completion  of  studies  by  the  bridging  TA  consultants.  Such \nsewerage tariffs will take effect upon related subproject\u2019s completion. \n(xiv)  GoK  will  ensure  that  measures  are  taken  to  improve  bill  collection  efficiency \nincluding  the  enforcement  of  existing  provisions  for  service  cut-off  due  to  non-\npayment. The appropriate levels of bill collection efficiency improvement targets for \nthe  Investment  Program  ULBs  will  be  agreed  between  GoK  and  ADB  upon \ncompletion of the studies currently being carried out by consultants under the World \nBank-supported KUWASIP project, and the studies by the bridging TA consultants. \n(xv)  GoK  will  ensure  that  the  Investment  Program  ULBs  will  by  not  later  than  31 \nDecember 2011, (a) take measures to significantly improve bill collection efficiency \nincluding  the  enforcement  of  existing  provisions  for  service  cut-off  due  to  non \npayment,  and  (b) introduce  self  assessment  system  or  capital  value  system  for \nproperty tax. \n(xvi)  For each PSP contract, the KUIDFC will propose three program consultant teams not \ndirectly involved in the geographical area concerned as candidates for independent \nauditor.  The  PSP  contractor  concerned  will  be  allowed  to  select  a  preferred \ncandidate for independent auditor\u2014to be employed by the KUIDFC\u2014from the list of \nthe three. \n(xvii)  GoK will, in sofar as it relates to the related projects, promptly notify ADB of any \nproposal  to  amend,  cancel,  or  repeal  any  of  the  provisions  of  the  KUIDFC\u2019s \nmemorandum  of  association  or  articles  of  incorporation  and  will  give  ADB  an \nadequate opportunity to comment on such proposals before taking any action. \n(xviii)  GoK  will  ensure  that  the  necessary  resolutions  shall  have  been  passed  by  the \nrelevant  ULBs  prior  to  allowing  the  KUWSDB  to  implement  bulk  water  supply \nschemes under component B of the Investment Program on behalf of a ULB. \n(xix)  GoK will ensure that all subprojects meet, to the satisfaction of ADB, the criteria \ndescribed in Schedule 4 to the Framework Financing Agreement. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n84.  I am satisfied that the proposed multitranche financing facility would comply with the Articles \nof Agreement of the ADB and, acting in the absence of the President, under the provisions of Article \n35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the Board approve the provision of \nloans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding \n$270,000,000 equivalent to India for the North Karnataka Urban Sector Investment Program from \nADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \nLiqun Jin \nVice President \n14 November 2006 \n ", "  Appendix 1   21\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data   \nTargets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \n  By the end of the Investment  (cid:131) Census data (next due  (cid:131)  Parallel development will \nImprovement of Urban  Program implementation period  in 2011).  occur in other key sectors \nInfrastructure  and services  (2016):    including transportation, \nresulting in overall    (cid:131) Annual economic  power, industry, education, \nimprovement in quality of  (cid:131)  reduction in the gaps  survey of Karnataka  and financial. \nlife in project ULBs; and  between per capita real  by the Directorate of  (cid:131) Political support for \nrelated increase in   income in assisted districts  Economics and  development in north \neconomic opportunities  and  and the state average;  Statistics.

General \n1.  The scale and rate of urban growth in India has led to serious deficiencies in the availability \nof basic urban infrastructure and the delivery of basic urban services. Most cities must deal with a \nlack of reliable and safe water supplies, inadequate wastewater systems, poorly maintained streets, \nand growing slum areas. The resultant negative social, economic, and environmental impacts are \nsignificant, with the urban poor being most directly affected. The Government's passage of the 74th \nConstitutional Amendment Act in 1992 marked the beginning of a new and committed approach to \naddressing the problems facing India's growing urban areas. The act provides for the progressive \ndevolution of authority and responsibility for urban affairs from the states to urban local bodies \n(ULBs). Essential to this provision is the need to undertake significant policy reforms aimed at \nimproving urban management, finance, and governance at the local level. The Government has also \nformulated an urban sector strategy and plan for the most urbanized states in the country. \n \nB.  Urban Sector \n1.  National \n2.  India  faces  a  formidable  challenge  in  responding  to  the  increasing  demand  for  urban \ninfrastructure, urban services, and housing in the country's rapidly expanding urban areas. With an \nurban population of around 285 million in 2001, the inadequacy of existing urban infrastructure and \nservices,  coupled  with  a  severe  shortage  of  affordable  housing,  poses  serious  constraints  to \nsustained economic growth and productivity. While India's cities are home to less than 30% of the \npopulation, they currently account for about 50% of gross domestic product and more than 90% of \nall Government revenues. However, the continued productivity of India's cities is contingent upon \nsignificant investments to upgrade and maintain urban infrastructure and to provide adequate levels \nof urban services. With India's urban population expected to grow to 405 million by 2011 and 550 \nmillion by 2021, the challenge lies in accommodating an average of more than 11 million new urban \nresidents per year. \n \n3.  In addition to being a major constraint to economic growth and productivity, the lack of \nadequate investments in urban infrastructure, urban services, and housing has social ramifications, \nespecially for the urban poor. According to some estimates, as much as 30% of the urban population \nlives below the official poverty line. In the larger cities, estimates indicate that approximately 28% of \npeople live in slums. India's slum population increased from about 28 million in 1981 to some 51 \nmillion  in  1991  and  is  expected  to  have  exceeded  100  million  by  2000.  The  health  and \nenvironmental implications of sprawling slums and households\u2019 lack of access to potable water, \nsewerage, drainage, sanitation, and waste disposal facilities are staggering. \n \n2.  Karnataka \n4.  Karnataka is one of India\u2019s most urbanized states, with an urban population of 17.9 million in \n2001,  accounting  for  34%  of  the  state's  total  population.  About  one  third  of  the  state's  urban \npopulation lives below the poverty line. The state capital of Bangalore is one of the fastest growing \nmetropolitan areas in the country and constitutes the center of India's high-technology industries, \nsuch as aerospace, telecommunications, and computer hardware and software development. The \nrapid expansion of industrial activities and the increased migration of people from rural areas and \nother parts of the country to Bangalore are placing considerable strains on the city\u2019s infrastructure \nand  services.  Living  conditions  are  deteriorating  rapidly,  urban  poverty  is  rampant,  and \nenvironmental problems are on the rise. \n \n5.  Although Bangalore has been Karnataka's center of urban and industrial growth for the past \ntwo decades, the state has recognized that the social and economic development potential of other \nprincipal urban centers has not been realized, mainly because of the absence of adequate levels of \ninvestment in basic urban infrastructure and services. In particular, the state has identified the \ncoastal  region,  with  Mangalore  constituting  the  primary  urban  center,  as  a  priority  area  for \ninvestment.  Despite  this  region's  rich  resource  base  and  strategic  location,  poor  infrastructure \nconditions have directly contributed to a deterioration in living standards and served as a major \nconstraint to economic growth. \n \n ", "26  Appendix 2   \n \n6.  The state has recently recognized that north Karnataka is also lagging behind the rest of the \nstate. Indeed, the High Power Committee Report for Redressal of Regional Imbalances1 noted that \nthe economy of north Karnataka has been worse off than that of other parts of the state for more \nthan four decades. The economy is primarily based on agriculture, with more than 36% of the \nworkforce employed in this sector. Average per capita incomes in all districts in north Karnataka are \nlower than the state average. Of the 78 clusters of ULBs defined as suffering from abject poverty \n(more than 40% of the population below the poverty line), 48 are located in north Karnataka. \n \n7.  The level of urban services in north Karnataka is poor. The water supply is intermittent in all \ntowns and is often as infrequent as once every 3 days to once a week. Only a few towns receive \nwater for 1 to 2 hours each day and the water quality is poor. Service coverage is limited, and on \naverage, houses with water supply connections account for only 67% of properties registered to pay \nproperty taxes. Where sewer systems have been constructed, coverage is limited and they generally \nserve only the older sections of each ULB. Only a few sewage treatment plants exist, and these do \nnot function well, if at all. Storm water drainage facilities are inadequate and frequently misused for \nsolid waste disposal. Roads are generally unpaved and junctions are inefficient. Slums exist in most \ntowns and their levels of urban infrastructure and services are extremely low, with some public \nstandposts serving up to about 300 people and only the most basic level of sanitation available. \nDetails  of  the  existing  service  levels  in  each  of  the  proposed  Investment  Program  ULBs  are \npresented in Table A2.1 at the end of this appendix. \n \nC.  Government Policies \n1.  National \n8.  India\u2019s 10th five-year plan (fiscal year 2002\u2013fiscal year 2007) proposes 8% annual growth for \nthe economy and focuses on four basic themes: high growth, equitable growth, human development, \nand reforms. With 80% of plan allocations targeting social expenditures, the 10th five-year plan aims \nto reduce poverty through access to education, health care, potable water, and sanitation. The plan \nalso focuses on good governance as a cross-cutting issue, notes the declining role of government in \nthe provision of services, and emphasizes the development of private sector participation and the \nprovision of an improved regulatory environment. \n \n9.  The  Government  has  stressed  its  resolve  to  energetically  pursue  the  goals  of  poverty \nreduction  through  shared  growth  and  of  inclusive  social  development  as  encapsulated  in  the \nNational Common Minimum Program. This program seeks to ensure that economic reforms are \noriented  primarily  toward  spreading  and  deepening  rural  prosperity,  improving  the  quality  and \ndelivery of public services, and bringing about a visible and tangible difference in the quality of life of \nordinary citizens. Overall, the program emphasizes the Government\u2019s commitment to undertake \neconomic reforms \u201cwith a human face.\u201d Its main goals relevant to the urban infrastructure sector are \nto \n(i)  increase investments in the development and expansion of physical infrastructure \nsuch as roads including highways, ports, power, railways, water supply, sewage \ntreatment, and sanitation; \n(ii)  raise public spending on education from 4.1% to 6% of gross domestic product, with \nat least half to be spent on primary and secondary education; \n(iii)  raise public spending on health from less than 1% to at least 2% to 3% of gross \ndomestic product over the next 5 years, focusing mainly on primary health care; \n(iv)  eliminate  the  federal  Government\u2019s  revenue  deficit  by  2009  to  release  more \nresources for investments in social and physical infrastructure; and \n(v)  strengthen social security, health insurance, and other schemes to improve the lives \nof informal sector workers. \n \n2.  Karnataka \n10.  The government of Karnataka is currently implementing comprehensive reforms in line with \nthe 10th five-year plan through the Directorate of Municipal Administration\u2019s (DMA\u2019s) Nirmala Nagar \nProgram.  This  is  a  six-module  program  that  is  addressing  the  key  issues  of  property  taxes, \naccounting, thrift and credit, public toilets, rainwater harvesting, and solid waste management. The \n                                                 \n1  Government of Karnataka. 2002. High Power Committee for Redressal of Regional Imbalances. Bangalore. ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n \nNirmala Nagar Program is being supported by a well-prepared human resources policy designed to \nabolish  obsolete  and  redundant  positions  and  appoint  well-qualified  professionals,  such  as \naccountants and environmental engineers, through competitive selection procedures. \n \n11.  Improving the poor rates of property registration (for tax purposes) and assessment and of \nproperty tax collection have been key objectives, as only about 75% of properties in Karnataka are \nassessed and registered, and of these only 50% actually pay property taxes. The unrealized tax \nincome is in the order of $70 million. The DMA is currently 70% through an ambitious program to \nsurvey 3 million properties in the 63 ULBs initially targeted under the reforms. The program is being \nsupported by well-designed management information and geographic information systems that were \ndeveloped by the eGovernments Foundation. The software packages being produced are highly \nadvanced. \n \n12.  Under  the  Karnataka  Urban  Infrastructure  Development  Project,  the  government  of \nKarnataka developed the fund-based accounting system using the town of Tumkur and the city of \nBangalore as pilot cases. The system has been working well, and the DMA is currently upgrading it \nas part of the ongoing sector reforms before rolling it out to the same 63 ULBs targeted for the first \nphase of reforms.  \n \nD.  Lessons  \n \n13.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has derived numerous lessons from its experience with \nintegrated urban development projects. For example, such projects must (i) be well defined in terms \nof their scope and scale; (ii) take into account both absorptive and implementation capacity when \nassessing the number of subsectors and towns to be included; (iii) limit the number of executing \nagencies so as not to complicate decisionmaking and the management process; (iv) ensure that the \nselection of towns for inclusion in the project is demand driven and based on the towns\u2019 commitment \nand ability to implement policy reforms, strengthen institutional capacities, and support community \nparticipation; and (v) have clear implementation arrangements, especially when projects involve a \nmultiplicity of institutions with overlapping responsibilities. Of particular concern is land acquisition, \nwhich is normally the primary cause of delay in implementing urban infrastructure projects. Advance \nactions and the strengthening of institutions responsible for project implementation are needed to \navoid such delays. Experience also shows that project ownership by the community should be \nestablished at an early stage of project design to achieve satisfactory operation and maintenance as \nwell as improved cost recovery. Finally, the emphasis on introducing market discipline into project \ndesign must be greater than observed in the past experiences in an effort to identify options for \nrecovering  costs  and  achieving  financial  sustainability.  Table  A2.2  lists  the  externally  assisted \nprojects in the urban sector in India at the end of this appendix. \n \nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy \n14.  In India, ADB's overall strategic thrust has been to help the Government promote efficient \nand sustainable economic growth to improve employment opportunities and reduce poverty. By \nsupporting the development of urban infrastructure, providing long-term funds for housing finance, \nand developing sustainable mechanisms for the delivery of social services, ADB is increasingly \nintegrating social welfare concerns into its strategy. Through its technical assistance and lending \nprograms, ADB is also promoting policy reform measures to address the legal, institutional, and \nfinancial problems confronting India's urban sector. These reform measures are aimed at liberalizing \nIndia's land and housing markets to attract more private investment into the sector. ADB's urban \nsector assistance emphasizes capacity-building and institutional strengthening initiatives aimed at \npromoting sustainable urban management. \n \n15.  Over the medium term, ADB's urban sector strategy for India calls for continued support for \nintegrated urban development projects in an effort to improve the urban environment and living \nconditions, especially of the urban poor, and to strengthen the capacity of ULBs to implement \nprojects and deliver services. Furthermore, urban projects in India are demand-driven, with key \ncriteria being ULBs' willingness to initiate policy reform measures as part of ADB-financed projects. \nThe overall design of integrated urban development projects takes ULBs\u2019 absorptive capacity into \naccount. The strategy also emphasizes the importance of using projects as a way to gain valuable \nlocal experience for improving project implementation and operation and maintenance capabilities. \nThus, to the extent possible, project execution should be through existing institutions, particularly \n ", "28  Appendix 2   \n \nULBs.  Integrated  urban  development  projects  funded  by  ADB  are  also  used  to  introduce  and \nimplement  various  cost-recovery  mechanisms  and  privatization  measures,  especially  for  water \nsupply  subprojects,  to  ensure  financial  sustainability.  ADB's  sector  strategy  emphasizes  the \nincorporation of appropriately designed community awareness and participation programs. ADB \nrecognizes that innovative approaches to participation by communities and beneficiaries, particularly \nlow-income households, are essential for overall project sustainability and replicability. In addition, \nADB\u2019s focus on the urban poor goes beyond infrastructure: it prescribes a holistic approach to \nmeeting their needs and empowering them to improve their own living conditions, including the use \nof self-help schemes and the careful application of cross-subsidies. \n ", " \n   \nTable A2.1: Summary of Population and Service Levels in Investment Program ULBs (as of 2004)   \n    Population (\u2018000)  Water Supply  Sewerage  Transport \nPercentage  Percentage  Percentage \nSource  of  of  of \nSupply  Population  Population  Population  Total  Percentage \n(liters per  Supply  Served by  Served by  Served  Length  of Roads \nUrban Local Body  District  2004  2021  capita/day)  Frequency  Connection  Sewers  by STP  (km)  Surfaced \nBadami  Bagalkot  26  39  67  1 hr/2d  39  0  0  35  70 \nBasavakalyan  Bidar  60  85  55  1 hr/3d  40  0  0  62  16 \nBelgaum  Belgaum  447  615  139  2 hr/2d  58  67  0  653  83 \nBellary  Bellary  331  416  129  2 hr/2d  44  37  100  549  39 \nBidar  Bidar  194  330  57  1.5 hr/d  24  15  37  330  29 \nBijapur  Bijapur  267  400  121  2 hr/2d  70  16  36  587  77 \nChamarajnagar  Chamarajnagar  64  102  209  4 hr/d  67  0  0  199  10 \nDavangere  Davangere  400  636  86  2 hr/2d  25  46  32  502  44 \nGadag-Betageri  Gadag  166  393  112  1.5 hr/2d  46  12  0  121  46 \nGangavathi  Koppal  106  159  88  2 hr/2d  18  0  0  98  26 \nGokak  Belgaum  70  97  64  1.5 hr/3d  64  0  0  113  42 \nGulbarga  Gulbarga  463  756  67  1 hr/2d  37  25  63  643  42 \nHaveri  Haveri  59  81  97  1 hr/3d  48  0  0  53  57 \nHospet  Bellary  172  262  108  3 hr/d  26  54  0  99  40 \nHubli-Dharwad  Dharwad  842  1,137  88  1 hr/week  44  0  0  630  70 \nIlkal  Bagalkot  56  67  65  3\u20144 hr/2d  31  0  14  84  21 \nJamkhandi  Bagalkot  61  81  75  1 hr/3d  53  19  79  98  26 \nKoppal  Koppal  62  89  103  2 hr/2d  23  0  0  141  11 \nNippani  Belgaum  62  79  68  3\u20134 hr/2d  73  0  0  86  59 \nRabkavi-Banhatti  Bagalkot  73  90  66  1.5 hr/2d  42  0  0  73  12  A\np\nRaichur  Raichur  227  343  200  1 hr/d  51  50  51  172  46  p\ne\nn\nRanebennur  Havari  98  140  79  0.75 hr/d  50  5  0  247  33  d\nix\nShahabad  Gulbarga  66  84  79  2 hr/d  21  0  0  33  46   2\n \nSindhanoor  Raichur  70  126  43  3\u20144 hr/2d  52  0  0  71  38 \nYadgir  Gulbarga  60  84  156  1 hr/2d  52  0  0  76  54 \n2\nd = day (2d = 2 days, 3d = 3 days), hr = hour, STP = sewerage treatment plant.  9\n \nSource: Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation. 2005.

General \n1.  The government of Karnataka (GoK) has developed a strategy to identify and select urban \nlocal bodies (ULBs), components, and subprojects that should be supported under the Investment \nProgram to achieve the desired impact of increasing economic growth in backward districts of north \nKarnataka and reducing imbalances between north Karnataka and the rest of the state. \n \nB.  Selection of ULBs \n2.  The selection of ULBs should be based on their potential to engines of growth in their \nclusters of ULBs (taluks) and districts. The state has 175 clusters of ULBs in 27 districts. The \nmajority of clusters of ULBs classified as \u201cmost backward\u201d are located in north Karnataka. Hence \nULBs located in north Karnataka are selected for support under the Investment Program.1 The \noperational selection criteria used for ULB selection are as follows: \n(i)  The ULB contributes no less than 10% of the related costs of the subproject. \n(ii)  The ULB has passed the necessary council resolutions to implement the Nirmala \nNagar Program reforms. \n(iii)  The  ULB  is  for  a  town  with  a  population  larger  than  50,000,  unless  otherwise \nacceptable to the GoK and ADB. \n(iv)  The ULB is not supported by the World Bank-assisted Karnataka Municipal Reform \nProject. \n(v)  The ULB is the district headquarters of a newly created district. \n(vi)  The ULB is for a town that is important for tourism and has been identified as such \nby the state\u2019s tourism policy.  \n \n3.  The criteria (i)-(iv) are required for all the ULBs to be selected for the Program, while the \ncriteria (v)-(vi) are additional consideration factors applied when selecting some of the initial 25 \nULBs. Based on the foregoing criteria, 25 ULBs have been initially selected for support and consist \nof 4 city corporations, 14 city municipality councils, 6 town municipalities, and 1 town panchayat. \nOther  ULBs  that  meet  the  foregoing  selection  criteria  may  subsequently  be  included  in  the \nInvestment Program if additional financial resources become available through budget savings or \ninitially selected ULBs drop out because they fail to meet the criteria for continued support. \n \nC.  Selection of Components \n4.  Based on discussions and consultations at both the state and ULB levels, it was concluded \nby the ADB and the Government that the Investment Program should support ULBs in developing 9 \nof the 18 basic urban services that are their mandated  municipality functions under the 12th \nschedule of the Constitution (included in the 74th Amendment to the Constitution in 1992), namely: \n(i) public health, sanitation and solid waste management; (ii) water supply for domestic, industrial, \nand commercial purposes; (iii) roads; (iv) public amenities, including street lighting, parking lots, bus \nstops, and public toilets; (v) slum improvement and upgrading; (vi) safeguarding the interests of \nweaker sections of society; (vii) urban poverty reduction; (viii) firefighting services; and (ix) urban \nforestry, protection of the environment, and promotion of ecological aspects. The basic urban \nservices not included in the Investment Program relate to urban planning, regulation of land use, \nplanning for economic and social development, provision of urban amenities and facilities (e.g., \nparks, gardens, and playgrounds), promotion of cultural, education and aesthetic aspects, burials \nand cremations, cattle pounds, vital statistics, and regulation of slaughter houses and tanneries.  \n \n5.  The  foregoing  items,  along  with  institutional  development  and  Investment  Program \nassistance, have been amalgamated into seven Investment Program components as follows: \n(i)  component A: sanitation infrastructure, \n(ii)  component B: water supply infrastructure, \n(iii)  component C: slum improvement, \n(iv)  component D: nonmunicipal infrastructure, \n                                                 \n1  One exception is Chamarajanagar, which is located in south Karnataka and is the headquarters of one of six newly \nformed districts in Karnataka. All other initially identified Investment Program ULBs are located in north Karnataka. \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \n(v)  component E: urban transport infrastructure, \n(vi)  component F: institutional development, and \n(vii)  component G: Investment Program assistance facility. \n  \nD.  Selection of Subprojects \n6.  Each ULB will prepare a city-level investment plan (CLIP), which may include all or some of \nthe five basic urban services components. The CLIP will be based on the current level of services, \nthe needs and preference of stakeholders, the financial and institutional capacity of the ULB, and \nthe  norms  and  standards  prescribed  by  GoK.  In  selecting  subprojects  in  each  ULB,  GoK\u2019s \nempowered committee should check and ensure the following: \n(i)  All the proposed CLIPs show reasonable financial improvements in accordance with \ncriteria agreed between GoK and the ULBs. \n(ii)  All subprojects in components B and E should demonstrate an effective internal rate \nof return of at least 12%. Other subprojects should demonstrate cost-effectiveness in \ncomparison with alternative schemes. \n(iii)  All subprojects will have prepared resettlement plans, if required, in accordance with \nthe Investment Program\u2019s resettlement framework.  \n(iv)  All subprojects will meet environmental subproject selection criteria and ULBs will \nhave  prepared  initial  environmental  examinations,  including  environmental \nmonitoring  plans,  in  accordance  with  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  environmental \nassessment and review procedures (Supplementary Appendix N). \n(v)  All  subprojects  will  have  prepared  indigenous  peoples  development  plans,  if \nrequired,  in  accordance  with  the  Investment  Program\u2019s  indigenous  peoples \ndevelopment framework. \n \n7.  For each component in each ULB, the subprojects selection criteria were developed further \nto include the following: \n \n8.  Component A: Sanitation Infrastructure \n(i)  The  ULB  will  introduce  and  make  effective  upon  subproject  completion  an \nappropriate sewerage tariff, as agreed between Asian Development Bank (ADB) and \nGoK, of no less than Rs10 per month. \n(ii)  Sewerage subprojects are limited to the areas where the per capita water supply is \nsufficient to ensure that self-cleansing velocities can be achieved on a regular basis \nwithout frequent system flushing. \n(iii)  Sewerage  subprojects  will  only  commence  once  sample  surveys  show  that \nconsumers are willing to connect. \n(iv)  Drainage subprojects are limited to areas where a tendency for flooding-related \nincidents has resulted in socioeconomic problems. Downstream rehabilitation and/or \nexpansion works should also be considered for inclusion as appropriate. ULBs must \nprepare a comprehensive drainage master plan in advance of commencing any \nwork. \n \n9.  Component B: Water Supply Infrastructure \n(i)  The ULB passes a relevant council resolution for the water tariff structure proposed \nunder the Investment Program. \n(ii)  Work on the water supply component will only commence once it is certain that the \nraw water source can be made secure under the Investment Program. \n(iii)  The norms for net per capita demand for water are fixed at a minimum of 90 litters \nper capita per day for all the ULBs. \n(iv)  Water  supply  subprojects  will  only  commence  once  sample  survey  shows  a \nwillingness of consumers to pay. \n(v)  Water supply subprojects must include provision for slum areas and for the poor in \ngeneral covered by the subproject. \n(vi)  The ULB passes a relevant council resolution, to achieve majority customer metering \nwithin 2 years after the completion of construction work.  \n(vii)  The ULB passes a relevant council resolution to increase the base volumetric water \ntariff to the real current volumetric tariff per cubic meter and to change the tariff \nschedule from the current unmetered monthly flat rate to a volumetric metered tariff ", "  Appendix 3  35 \nwith the lifeline block set at 8 cubic meters for Rs55 per month, to be effected zone \nby  zone  or  for  the  related  town,  as  feasible,  upon  completion  of  the  related \nsubproject.  \n(viii)  The unmetered monthly tariff for domestic water use has been increased from Rs45 \nto at least Rs55 per month. \n(ix)  The ULB passes a relevant council resolution to set up separate accounting systems \nfor water supply and sewerage within the ULB. \n \n10.  Component C: Slum Improvement \n(i)  Subprojects are limited to water supply, sanitation infrastructure, formation of self-\nhelp groups, health and environmental sanitation awareness campaigns, footpaths, \nand pavements within notified slums. \n(ii)  Subprojects in slums will be conducted in coordination with neighborhood groups \nand ULB-level nongovernment organizations. \n \n11.  Component D: Nonmunicipal Infrastructure \n(i)  Firefighting  service  subprojects  should  be  in  accordance  with  Karnataka\u2019s \naccelerated fire and emergency services improvement plan. \n(ii)  Support for tourism infrastructure is to be provided only to those ULBs identified in \nthe state tourism policy (i.e., a maximum of 6 ULBs out of the initially identified 25). \n(iii)  District  information  centers  are  to  focus  on  attracting  industrial  investment  and \npromoting tourism.  \n(iv)  Only lakes in the ULBs that suffer from significant degradation and/or solid waste \ndeposition will be included in cleanup programs. \n \n12.  Component E: Urban Transport Infrastructure \n(i)  The  relevant  ULB  shall  have  progressed  in  completing  subprojects  under \nComponent  A,  B  and  C  to  the  satisfaction  of  GoK,  the  Karnataka  Urban \nInfrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) and ADB, so that the \nsubprojects under this component are ready to be tendered upon approval. \n(ii)  Work is limited to rehabilitating existing roads and upgrading of junctions.  \n(iii)  Widening  of  existing  roads  involving  land  acquisition  and/or  resettlement  is  not \nincluded under the Investment Program, except as otherwise accepted by ADB and \nthe  KUIDFC  and  subject  to  compliance  requirements  under  ADB\u2019s  Involuntary \nResettlement Policy (1995)2 and related frameworks. \n(iv)  Work is limited to roads within the municipal jurisdiction of related project town. \n \nE.  Approval Procedures for Subprojects \n \n13.  All the subprojects will be prepared and processed as follows: \n(i)  With the assistance of KUIDFC, each ULB will prepare a City-level Infrastructure \nPlan (CLIP) which will identify the gaps between the current and target levels of \nurban infrastructure, estimate the required interventions required to fill the gaps, and \npropose subprojects in components A-E to be funded under the Investment Program. \nAll the subprojects should meet the subproject selection criteria. \n(ii)  The ULBs will send their CLIPs via the KUIDFC to the empowered committee for \napproval and to ADB for review to ensure their compliance with provisions in the \nframework financing agreement. \n(iii)  The KUIDFC will undertake detailed appraisal of the subprojects with the assistance \nof the program consultants, and will prepare a summary subproject appraisal report \nbased on the CLIPs that include the rationale for each subproject; the scope and \ncomponents; a technical description and analysis; the cost estimates and financing \nplan; an environment assessment as required; a resettlement plan as required; an \nindigenous people development plan as required; the implementation arrangements; \nand financial, economic and institutional analyses. \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 1995.

ADB may advise \nthe KUIDFC to modify the reports if necessary. \n(v)  Based on ADB\u2019s approval, and subject to any modifications and measures required \nby ADB, the KUIDFC and GoK will prepare periodic financing requests for ADB \nfinancing.  \n(vi)  Periodic  financing  requests  will  be  formally  submitted  to  ADB  through  the \nGovernment for further processing. \nF.  Monitoring during Implementation \n14.  The GoK, acting through the KUIDFC, will be responsible for monitoring of implementation \nof all subprojects. ", "  Appendix 4  37 \nKEY FEATURES AND OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED \nDEFERRED PAYMENT STRUCTURE CONTRACTS \nA.  Rationale and Key Features \n1.  To date, the Government of India\u2019s approach to capital investments in infrastructure has \nbeen by means of conventional construction or turnkey contracts on a competitive basis. These are \nthen handed over to urban local bodies (ULBs) for operation, and the latter generally bear the risk \nof contractors adopting low capital cost but high maintenance cost designs. Once the assets have \nbeen handed over to the ULBs, the required operation and maintenance (O&M) tends to be ignored \nbecause of the ULBs\u2019 insufficient finances, inadequate skills, and poor management practices, \nleading to deterioration of the assets and poor service performance, plus failure to achieve the \nobjectives of projects to deliver adequate services. \n2.  Thus with the objective of achieving long-term sustainability of service delivery and ensuring \nthe use of the lowest-cost designs over the entire period of a project, including construction as well \nas  O&M,  the  Government  has  reviewed  this  traditional  approach  and  decided  to  adopt  the \nperformance-based deferred payment structure (PBDPS) modality as an alternative for selected \nsubprojects under the Investment Program. \n3.  While seeking improved accountability of contractors through performance-based service \nprovisions, the Government, at the same time, intends to pursue another objective: mobilizing the \nabundant private sector liquidity for worthy public sector projects. By implementing subprojects \nusing the PBDPS modality, the Government expects to realize the efficiencies of the private sector \nin relation to both construction and O&M in addition to bringing in private funding to augment scarce \npublic funding. Government agencies will continue to be responsible for overall service provision, \nincluding the regulation of tariffs and the collection of revenues. \n4.  India has already implemented a few projects in the transport and municipal solid waste \nsubsectors  using  the  PBDPS  modality.  Furthermore,  the  Karnataka  Urban  Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) is preparing a pilot project under the PDBPS \nmodality in the city of Bijapur, one of the Investment Program ULBs, for the water supply and \nsewerage subsectors, using its own resources.  \n5.   The  KUIDFC  undertook  an  initial  sounding  out  of  potential  local  contractors  during \npreparation  of  the  Investment  Program,  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  Fact-Finding \nMission  did  so  at  the  time  of  loan  appraisal,  and  a  comprehensive  workshop  was  held  with \nprospective  private  contractors  resulting  in  valuable  feedback.  The  workshop  was  primarily \nattended by local contractors.1 The consultants recruited by ADB to carry out the workshop will \nfollow up with a detailed market research exercise in the form of a written survey to seek further \nfeedback from private contractors not limited to those who attended the workshop. The workshop \nindicated that there are private contractors interested in participating in PBDPS contracts. The key \nconcerns expressed by participants at the workshop will be taken into consideration during the \ncontract preparation stage. These include force majeure, provisions for price escalation, security of \nwater sources, payment guarantees, arbitration provisions, and provisions for independent auditors \nto monitor and assess performance benchmarks. The participants also noted that strong political \ncommitment to the process and early resolution of land acquisition issues are paramount for the \nsuccess of private sector participation (PSP) contracts. \n6.  The operating framework for the PBDPS modality necessitates a clear definition of services, \nwhose delivery will be the responsibility of private contractors, rather than indicating a set of \ndiscrete activities aimed at physical improvements. The contracts will be configured in such a \nmanner that all activities relevant to service delivery are clearly identified and included in the terms \nof reference for the private contractor. In cases where making the private contractor responsible for \nthe entire range of activities is not feasible, the contractors\u2019 specific responsibilities will be clearly \ndelineated.  \n                                                 \n1  Twelve private contractors, including two international contractors, attended the workshop. \n ", "38  Appendix 4 \n7.  The consultants recruited under the bridging technical assistance (TA)2 will prepare a model \nrequest for proposal, including a draft contract for water supply and sewerage subprojects, with \nsupport from international (individual) consultants recruited separately by ADB. \n8.  The following criteria will be used to identify the amenability to and appropriateness of \nsubprojects adopting the PBDPS modality: (i) the ratio of the cost of operations to total life cycle \ncost; (ii) the risk allocation among relevant parties as envisaged under the PBDPS modality; and \n(iii) the size of the subproject, the willingness of urban ULBs to adopt the PBDPS modality, and the \ninterest of the private sector. The cost of operations is the net present value of O&M expenses and \ndebt servicing liabilities. Total life cycle is the sum of total capital investment costs (including \ninterest during construction and financing charges) and the cost of operations. Subprojects with a \ncost of operations to total life cycle ratio of approximately 20% or more could be considered \namenable  to  the  PBDPS  modality.  Similarly,  the  size  of  a  subproject  is  an  indicator  of  its \nattractiveness  to  private  contractors.  Other  factors  in  determining  whether  or  not  the  PBDPS \nmodality is appropriate include ULB-related concerns, such as geography and availability of human \nresources and physical resources. \n9.  The KUIDFC and the ULBs will recruit private contractors with support from the program \nconsultants.  \n10.  The  KUIDFC  will  (i) act  as  the  fund  manager  for  the  PSP  fund  to  be  established  for \nsubprojects  using  the  PBDPS  modality;  (ii) act  as  the  technical  cell  for  developing  projects, \npreparing draft contracts and bidding documents and requests for proposals, assisting with the \nrecruitment of suitable private contractors, and helping with contract execution and monitoring of \ncontractors\u2019  performance;  and  (iii) assist  in  building  the  capacity  of  the  ULBs  for  contract \nmanagement, including monitoring contractors\u2019 performance. \n11.  Each ULB will (i) provide all necessary approvals from its council for implementing identified \nsubprojects  using  the  PBDPS  modality;  (ii) award  the  contract  and  monitor  contractors\u2019 \nperformance; (iii) enter into commitments for replenishing and ensuring the availability of funds to \nmeet contractual obligations; (iv) ensure the timely fulfillment of project requirements, such as land \nacquisition and rights-of-way; and (v) assist private contractors in obtaining relevant permits and \nclearances and resolving any local issues as required. \n12.  The private contractor will be paid annuity-like payments throughout the contract period \n(typically  10  years),  subject  to  adherence  to  the  predetermined  performance  standards.  The \ncontract is broken into two phases: construction and operations. The payments would be made to \nthe  private  contractor  during  the  construction  phase  and  the  operations  phase  on  achieving \nrespective sets of predetermined milestones. Each payment will consist of a base fee and an \nadditional incentive bonus linked to the contractor\u2019s performance as measured by a set of key \nperformance  indicators.  Contracts  for  subprojects  using  the  PBDPS  modality  will  be  tripartite \ncontracts among the relevant Investment Program ULB, the private contractor, and the KUIDFC. \n13.  The KUIDFC will establish the PSP fund, which will safeguard contractors in case of default \nby ULBs, and will ensure that sufficient funds are provided for and maintained under this facility. \nConsidering the innovative nature of the PBDPS, such a fund is necessary to increase bidders\u2019 \nconfidence and attract private financing. Based on estimates that capital investments using the \nPBDPS (and/or performance-based management contract) modality will total $50 million and that \nunder  the  payment  schedule  to  be  adopted,  the  maximum  exposure  by  contractors  will  total \napproximately $10 million, the value of the fund will be approximately $10 million. The fund release \nmechanism will be developed by the KUIDFC with the assistance of the bridging TA consultants \nand will be agreed on with ADB.  \n14.  A financial model has been prepared and a summary presented in Figure A4.1, based on a \nhypothetical case for the water supply and sewerage components for a typical ULB. \n \n \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2006.

Outline Terms of Reference \n15.  Under the PBDPS, the private contractor will be a company or a consortium of companies \nthat is responsible for design, engineering, procurement, partial financing, construction, and O&M \nand for the transfer of the project assets at the end of the contract period in line with the applicable \ncontract provisions to ensure the delivery of services at predetermined standards of performance. \n16.  The  contracts  will  have  the  following  key  features:  (i) typically  a  10-year  contract  with \nannuity-like payments, each consisting of a base fee, which will be indexed to local inflation, and an \nadditional incentive bonus, over the contract period; (ii) design and construction standards and \noperational  standards;  (iii) key  performance  indicators  for  the  delivery  of  services;  and \n(iv) responsibility for distribution network rehabilitation and expansion, management of services and \nresources, including staff, to achieve the expected targets. Standards are minimum requirements \n(e.g., water quality standards), with a failure to achieve them possibly triggering financial penalties \nfor the private contractor, while key performance indicators are for the purpose of measuring the \nprivate  contractor\u2019s  performance,  which  will  be  reflected  in  the  amount  of  additional  incentive \nbonuses paid. \n17.  An independent auditor or engineer will review, monitor, and where contractually required, \napprove activities associated with design, construction, and O&M under each PBDPS contract to \nensure the private contractor\u2019s compliance with contract provisions. \n18.  Subprojects  under  the  PBDPS  modality  will  be  procured  under  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for \nProcurement. The use of a two-stage bidding procedure to be preceded by prequalification is \nproposed for the recruitment of private contractors under this modality. The first stage will involve \nthe  evaluation  of  technical  proposals,  which,  if  necessary,  will  be  revised  to  meet  specified \nrequirements by discussions between the ULB and the bidders. The second stage will involve the \nevaluation of financial proposals, prepared based on revised technical proposals. The financial \nselection of the bidders will be based on the minimum annuity payment, which also reflects a \nlifetime cost approach. \n ", "40  Appendix 4 \n19.  The private contractor will be responsible for managing system O&M and for delivering \nservices, including overseeing investments on behalf of the ULB for the relevant subsector. In \nparticular, the tasks of the private contractor will include the following: \n(i)  Design and build infrastructure facilities in line with specified output requirements \nand construction standards. \n(ii)  Operate the systems according to specified operational standards. \n(iii)  Improve long-term performance and efficiency and expand service coverage in the \nULB\u2019s service area. \n(iv)  Continue mass meter installation and connection programs in the ULB. \n(v)  Improve the O&M of water supply and wastewater systems through various means, \nsuch as using staff efficiently, rehabilitating distribution networks, improving customer \nservice, enhancing occupational safety practices, and reducing leakage. \n(vi)  Assist and advise the ULB in relation to network expansion planning, investment \nbudget preparation, and tariff setting. \n(vii)  Improve  the  long-term  effectiveness  of  the  ULB\u2019s  human  resources  through  a \ncapacity building and skills transfer program. \n(viii)  Implement programs to expand water distribution networks, including bulk water \nmetering, properly sequenced network rehabilitation, and renewal of connections. \n(ix)  Resolve customer complaints and measure customer satisfaction. \n \nC.  Arrangements for Personnel and Organizational Structure \n20.  Given the strong policy stand taken by the government of Karnataka (GoK) in freezing staff \nrecruitment for more than a decade, most ULBs are not overstaffed. In addition to a few senior staff \nassigned by the state, the ULBs have their own staff to oversee operations in each subsector. For \nwater supply and sewerage, for instance, the ULBs have between 20 and 45 permanent staff. \n21.  The bridging TA consultants will help GoK formulate a post-PBDPS operations strategy and \na human resources strategy for existing ULB employees affected by the introduction of PBDPS \ncontracts.  \n \n22.  The implementing agencies will undertake the following preparatory measures to ensure a \nsmooth transition and a sustainable organizational structure in relation to the private contractors \nduring and after the PBDPS contracts: \n(i)  For the water supply and sewerage subsector, GoK will continue its recruitment \nfreeze  policy  for  the  ULBs  and  agree  to  delegate  their  service  provision \nresponsibilities to the private contractors. \n(ii)  The KUIDFC and the ULBs will consult with staff in the concerned subsector(s), as \nwell as with the Directorate of Municipal Administration and the Municipal Employees \nAssociation,  to  prepare  the  following  options,  which  will  be  offered  to  current \nemployees: \n(a)  Staff may be assigned to the private contractor for a maximum period of 5 \nyears in line with rule 2004 of the Karnataka Municipal Corporation, with a \nprovision for extension with mutual agreement. \n(b)  Staff may agree to enter into the voluntary retirement scheme if offered by \nGoK. \n(c)  Staff may be reassigned to other ULB functions or departments. \n(iii)  A comprehensive list of current employees in various categories, such as assistant \nor junior engineers, work inspectors, valve workers, fitters, clerks, and bill collectors, \nwill be prepared as part of the requests for proposal and draft contract documents for \nsubprojects using the PBDPS. ULBs will provide the bidders with the names, ages, \nqualifications, and terms of employment of each of these employees. \n23.  As part of their proposals, the bidders will then be required to submit strategies for taking \nover a certain minimum percentage of the permanent employees (the percentage to be decided \nafter consultation between the ULB and the bidders at the prebid conference for each subproject \nusing  the  PBDPS).  Bidders  will  be  given  incentives  to  take  the  maximum  number  of  current \nemployees  as  part  of  their  capacity-building  and  skills  transfer  strategy.  The  length  of  their \nassignment to the private contractor and the strategy and arrangements for their return to the ULB \nwill also form part of the bidders\u2019 proposals, which will subsequently be agreed to between the ULB \nand the private contractor. ", "  Appendix 4  41 \n24.  The  private  contractor  will  have  full  day-to-day  management  responsibilities  over  the \nassigned staff from the date of their deputation. The contractor shall ensure that assigned ULB \nemployees are entitled to wages, increments, bonuses, paid leaves of absence, and all other \nemployee benefits and entitlements in the same manner as or better than what such employees \nwould have been entitled to in the employment of the ULBs in the absence of such assignment. \n25.  During the initial 5-year period, the assigned staff will have the opportunity to assess the \nopportunities offered to them, such as returning to the ULB or becoming permanent employees of \nthe private contractor. At an early stage of the contract, the ULB must provide a clear post-PBDPS \noperational strategy for the private contractor, in consultation with ADB, so that the contractor can \neither offer permanent employment to the employees or return them to the ULB. \n26.  After the expiry of the initial 5 years, the private contractor will not be obliged to take on any \nadditional staff from the ULB. \n ", "42  Appendix 5 \nKEY FEATURES AND OUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED \nMANAGEMENT CONTRACTS \nA.  Recruitment Procedures \n1.  The workshop held during the appraisal of the Investment Program revealed that while \nsome private contractors are interested in participating in performance-based deferred payment \nstructure (PBDPS) contracts, the level of interest may decline as more of the contractual details \nare determined and the full extent of private contractors\u2019 responsibilities under the PBDPS \nbecomes more widely known. The ADB and the Government of Karnataka (GoK) therefore \nconsidered it prudent to develop a performance-based management contract (PBMC) option as \na less onerous alternative for some subprojects. Under this arrangement, the management \ncontractor will be reimbursed through a base fee (i.e., for experts\u2019 inputs and out-of-pocket \nexpenditures)  for  management  services  and  additional  performance-based  incentive  bonus \npayments linked to its performance as measured by a set of key performance indicators. A \nmanagement contract that does not require the management contractor to invest in the physical \ninfrastructure of water supply and wastewater systems is more straightforward and less risky \n(for the urban local body (ULB) as well as for the private contractor) than other private sector \nparticipation modalities that require financial investments by the private sector such as the \nPBDPS.  Recruitment  of  management  contractors  will  be  carried  out  under  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB's) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants with some adjustments. \n2.  The typical length of contracts under the PBMC modality will range between 3 and 6 \nyears, with a possibility of extension. \n3.  The management contractor will be a company or consortium of companies that will \nhave  direct  responsibility  for  managing  the  operations  of  a  proposed  subproject  for  the \nconcerned ULB. The management contractor will have to bear much more risk than a typical \nconsultant, because a substantial amount of the contractor\u2019s total remuneration will depend on \nits success in improving the delivery of services currently provided by the ULB. In addition, \nwhen preparing its proposals, the management contractor will have to investigate the state of \nexisting systems in greater depth than the typical consultant, and the costs of preparing a \nproposal will be therefore be higher. Because of the limited number of private contractors with \nthe required expertise and possible limited interest because of the high costs of preparing a \ncompetitive  proposal,  the  shortlist  may  not  meet  the  requirements  of  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  of \n\"normally 5\u20137 firms.\" \n4.  To come up with a shortlist of qualified companies and/or consortia, the criteria for \nshortlisting will include the following:  \n(i)  a set of criteria to identify companies and/or consortia that have the necessary \npractical operating experience and financial capacity to be able to execute the \ncontract successfully; and \n(ii)  a  summary  of  the  experience  and  skills  of  the  companies  and/or  consortia, \ntogether with brief responses to a list of questions that focus on how they have \naddressed or would address problems similar to those the ULBs would face in \nimproving service provision in the concerned subsectors. \n5.  An evaluation committee would consider private contractors meeting these criteria for \nshortlisting based on expressions of interest received.1 The primary weight in this evaluation will \nbe given to each contractor's corporate experience and approach to managing operational \nproblems such as those prevalent in north Karnataka. Ensuring a reasonable geographic and \ncountry balance in the resulting shortlist of contractors may be difficult, as the expertise required \nfor  such  services  is  not  widely  available.  It  is  therefore  proposed  by  ADB  to  waive  the \nguidelines' \"reasonable\" geographic and country balance requirement. However, contractors are \nfree  to  associate  with  any  regional  and  national  firms  and  individuals  from  ADB  member \ncountries to strengthen their proposals. Also contractors must demonstrate not only their in-\ndepth technical strengths, but also the availability of high-quality backup support to ensure that \nthey can fulfill their commitment during the period of the contract. The shortlisted contractors will \nthen be invited to submit technical proposals containing detailed technical plans for operating \n                                                 \n1  Interested companies and/or consortia will be given an expression of interest template to complete. ", "  Appendix 5  43 \nand  improving  the  services  and  systems  together  with  financial  proposals  in  line  with  the \nrequest  for  proposal  documents. The  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method is  used  in \naccordance with the guidelines. \n6.  The evaluation of the technical proposals submitted will give approximately equal weight \nto (i) the qualifications of the individuals making up the proposed management team; (ii) the \nexperience,  expertise,  and  support  facilities  of  the  contractors;  and  (iii) the  proposals  for \noperating and improving the services and systems. The proposed management team for each \ncontractor  will  be  required  to  present  its  proposal  to  the  Karnataka  Urban  Infrastructure \nDevelopment and Finance Corporation and the pertinent ULB and to answer questions about its \nmembers\u2019 experience and the team\u2019s approach to addressing the problems the ULB is facing. \nThe  financial  proposals  will  indicate  the  contractor\u2019s  costs  for  performing  the  services \n(remuneration and out-of-pocket expenditures). Under the contract, the contractor will also \nreceive a performance-based bonus payment and details of this will be indicated in the request \nfor  proposal  documents.  Considering  the  unique  and  complex  nature  of  this  particular \nrecruitment, an ADB observer may attend key evaluation committee meetings, in particular, the \npresentation and interview sessions. \nB.  Outline Terms of Reference \n7.  The management contract will have the following key features: (i)  a 3-to 6-year contract \n(typically),  with  remuneration  consisting  of  a  fixed  fee  and  performance-based  incentive \npayments;  (ii)   a  limited  number  of  easily  measurable  key  performance  indicators,  whose \nbaseline levels will be determined during the first year of operations, to which performance-\nbased payments will be linked; and (iii)  a number of service obligations as defined in the license \nissued by the ULB, which may include responsibility for implementing investments on behalf of \nthe ULB. \n8.  ADB  anticipates  that  the  management  contractor  will  bring  in  a  limited  number  of \nexpatriate staff and that its management team will likely include several Indian nationals. \n9.  The  management  contractor  will  be  responsible  for  managing  the  operation  and \nmanagement of the systems and services, including overseeing investments on behalf of the \nULB for the concerned subsector as appropriate. In particular, the tasks of the management \ncontractor will include \n(i)  improving the long-term performance and efficiency of services and expanding \ntheir coverage in the ULB\u2019s service area; \n(ii)  enhancing the delivery of services to the poor through a targeted program of \nconnections and service improvements in low-income communities; \n(iii)  upgrading the operation and management of water and wastewater systems \nthrough  various  means,  such  as  more  efficient  revenue  collection, \nimplementation  of  computerized  billing  and  accounting,  introduction  of \nmanagement  information  systems,  improved  customer  service,  improved \noccupational safety practices, and reduced leakage; \n(iv)  assisting  and  advising  the  ULB  in  relation  to  strategic  planning,  budget \npreparation, and tariff setting; \n(v)  improving the effectiveness of the ULB\u2019s human resources through a coordinated \ncapacity-building program; \n(vi)  managing the implementation of an investment program to improve the water \ndistribution network, including bulk water metering, properly sequenced network \nrehabilitation, and renewal of connections, on behalf of the ULB; \n(vii)  resolving customer complaints and measuring customer satisfaction. \nC.  Arrangements for Personnel and Organizational Structure \n10.  The consultants for the bridging technical assistance2 will help the ULB formulate a post-\nPBMC  operations  strategy  and  a  human  resources  strategy  for  existing  ULB  employees \naffected by the introduction of PBMC contracts.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Karnataka:  \nThe north Karnataka region of India  has traditionally lagged behind other regions in relation to infrastructure \ndevelopment.1 Baseline surveys indicate that the poor suffer more from low-quality urban infrastructure and services in \nnorth Karnataka than those who are better-off. Less than 30% of households have access to water connections, and in \nslum areas the figure is less than 10%. More than 75% of slum dwellers in north Karnataka towns such as Bellary, \nGagad-Betageri, Gulbarga, Koppal, and Rabkavi-Banhatti and 45% to 60% in Badami, Basavakalyan, Davangere, \nGokak, Raichur, and Yadgir depend on standposts (public taps). The slum populations also receive lower water \npressure delivered less frequently and in shorter durations compared with the general population. In addition, more \nthan 85% of slum households lack access to safe sanitation. Lack of access to underground drainage connections was \nreported by slum households in 16 of the 25 initially identified Investment Program ULBs. Surveys also show that more \nthan 60% of slum dwellers in the Investment Program ULBs report poor access to roads.  \n \nSecondary data from the Karnataka Slum Clearance Board place the slum population in Investment Program ULBs at \nroughly 20% of the total population. A baseline socioeconomic survey conducted in the slums of Investment Program \nULBs shows that 85% of the slum population accounts for the core and intermediate poor (with a household income of \nless than Rs2,500 per month). The Investment Program is expected to benefit all slum households residing in \nrecognized slums (70% of the total slum population) in Investment Program ULBs. It will also benefit poor households \nin nonslum areas (15% of the total urban population). The Investment Program will result in better access to urban \ninfrastructure services. Benefits from the sanitation component are expected to accrue to households connected to the \nsewerage network. Networks will be provided in densely built-up core and unserved or underserved areas. Sewerage \nnetworks will reach the boundaries of slum areas, which will enable the networking of a large number of slums and \nprovide low-cost toilets connected to sewers. Benefits to poor households from the road component will be through \nemployment generation and access. Water supply will benefit all Investment Program urban local body populations. \nBroader benefits to the poor  will include economic growth and employment generation. In addition, the slum \nimprovement component will result in community development in poor areas. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nPoverty impact analyses undertaken in three Investment Program ULBs suggest that 30% to 50% of beneficiaries for \nthe water supply component comprise the core and intermediate poor (the proportion varies between 25% to 40% for \nsewerage and 80% to 100% for drainage. Participatory analysis using a combination of qualitative and quantitative \ntechniques will gauge post\u2013Investment Program benefits in terms of improved access to urban infrastructure and \nservices by the poor. The baseline survey will serve as the benchmark against which post\u2013Investment Program \nimpacts on the poor will be measured. Benefits to poor households, benefits to women, increased participation, and \ncapacity building of the poor (including women) are some of the items that will be measured and monitored following \nimplementation. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nStakeholder consultations have been an important element of the Investment Program\u2019s development and design. \nConsultation workshops  were held  with those affected, district and municipal officials, elected representatives, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and eminent citizens. Workshops were held during the initial phase of the \nstudy and following the selection and prioritization of proposed interventions in each Investment Program town. \nBaseline surveys and focus group discussions held in slum and nonslum Investment Program ULBs obtained the \nexpressed needs of communities and recorded people\u2019s opinions. Consultations and interactions with the community \nhelped identify and prioritize subprojects in each Investment Program ULB. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nPublic participation has been a key feature of the Investment Program\u2019s design and will continue through detailed \ndesign, planning, implementation, and operation and maintenance. The strategy for public participation focuses on \npartnership  building  between  NGOs,  business  communities,  urban  local  bodies,  stakeholder  agencies  like  the \nKarnataka Slum Clearance Board, and neighborhoods. An assessment of communities\u2019 absorptive capacity was \nundertaken prior to preparing the participation strategy. Local, town-, and district-level NGOs and an apex NGO will be \ninvolved in monitoring community participation. Ongoing consultation and participatory monitoring will help ensure that \nthe Investment Program meets communities\u2019 needs, thereby contributing to sustainability. The participation strategy is \nin Supplementary Appendix H. \n                                                 \n1  Government of Karnataka. 2002.

Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nPrimary and secondary information has been analyzed to assess the status of women in Investment Program ULBs. \nBaseline survey information shows that the town-level proportion of female-headed households is up to 15%. The \nproportion is larger in slums, particularly Koppal (50%); Gokak and Ranebennur (30%); and Haveri, Nippani, and \nRaichur (20% to 25%). The female work participation rate in slums in Investment Program ULBs averages 10%\u2014and \nnotably  higher  in  Haveri  (35%),  Chamarajnagar  (23%),  and  Ilkal  (19%)\u2014compared  with  nonslum  populations. \nDisparities in the educational attainment of women is evident in Investment Program ULBs for both slum and nonslum \npopulations.  \n \nThe gender strategy proposed for the Investment Program focuses participation by women, which is expected to \nmaximize beneficial impacts on women. The Investment Program proposes an increased role than currently observed \nin decision making by women in Investment Program design, implementation, and monitoring. The Investment \nProgram is expected to result in benefits for women that include a reduced burden in relation to collecting water, \nhealth benefits, and employment opportunities. Monitoring and evaluation systems will generate gender-disaggregated \ninformation to enable tracking of the Investment Program\u2019s gender impacts.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nThe gender strategy is in Supplementary Appendix I and a gender action plan is provided in Appendix 11. The gender \naction plan details goals and objectives from a gender perspective, actions to be taken, indicators and mechanisms for \nmonitoring, and responsibilities to be assigned to various stakeholders at various stages of the Investment Program. \n \nE.

Introduction \n1.  The Investment Program will facilitate economic growth in towns of north Karnataka and \nbring  about  urban  development  by  means  of  equitable  distribution  of  urban  services  in  an \nenvironmentally sound and operationally sustainable manner. The Investment Program will help the \nGovernment of Karnataka (GoK) rehabilitate and construct urban infrastructure, including water \nsupply systems, sewerage systems, drainage, and urban road improvements through resurfacing \nand junction improvements. It will have poverty reduction, institutional development, investment \nprogram assistance,1 and nonmunicipal infrastructure2 components.  \n2.  The Investment Program is designed so as to minimize land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts. Subprojects involving rehabilitation will be accommodated within the premises of existing \nfacilities and will not involve land acquisition and resettlement. Subprojects involving the construction \nof water supply systems, sewage treatment plants, and nonmunicipal infrastructure are proposed on \nGovernment land wherever possible. Overall impacts are to be further minimized through careful \nsubproject siting and alignment during detailed design and subproject implementation.3 \n3.  Short resettlement plans were prepared for sample subprojects in three Investment Program \nULBs  (Haveri,  Hospet,  and  Raichur)  (Supplementary  Appendixes  J1  to  J3).4  Permanent  land \nacquisition is required for sewage treatment plants in Haveri (13 hectares), Hospet (12 hectares), \nand Raichur (14 hectares). There are no structures on the proposed sewage treatment plant sites, \nwhich  are currently  being  used  for  agriculture.  No  permanent  or  temporary  land  acquisition  is \nanticipated for road resurfacing. The laying of water and sewer pipelines and drain improvements \nare proposed within existing road corridors, and only temporary land acquisition that affects hawkers \nand vendors is anticipated during construction. Impacts will be finalized during detailed design. A \nsummary of resettlement impacts and key socioeconomic information is in Table A12.1. \nTable A12.1: Summary of Resettlement Impacts \nItem  Haveri  Hospet  Raichur \nPermanent Land Acquisition (hectares)  13   12   14  \nNumber of Affected Households  4  14  11 \nNumber of Affected People  24  150  75 \nNumber of Affected People without Titles to Land  0  0  0 \nNumber of Female-Headed Households  0  0  0 \nNumber of Vulnerable Affected People  12  28  3 \nNumber of Affected Structures  0  0  0 \nNumber of Affected Common Property Resources  0  0  0 \nAverage Household Annual Income (Rs)  350,000  260,000  400,000 \nPrimary Source of Income  Agriculture and  Agriculture  Agriculture \nservices \nAverage Household Size (number of people)  6.0  10.0  6.5 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nB.  Resettlement Framework and Policy \n4.  This  summary  captures  the  salient  points  of  the  resettlement  framework  presented  in \nSupplementary Appendix K. The resettlement framework outlines the objectives, policy principles, \nand procedures for land acquisition (if required), compensation, and other assistance measures for \nthose affected. The resettlement framework is based on the Land Acquisition Act (1894, amended in \n1984),  the  national  policy  on  resettlement  and  rehabilitation  for  Investment  Program-affected \npersons,  and  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB\u2019s)  policy  on  involuntary  resettlement.5  The \n                                                 \n1  Covering the construction of the Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation building on \nvacant government land. \n2  Covering firefighting, lake development, tourism, and sports. \n3  The total estimated land requirement for the Investment Program in 25 subproject ULBs is 512.12 hectares. Of this, \n215.8 hectares are Government land. About 300 hectares will need to be acquired, of which about 120 hectares have \nnot yet been identified.   \n4  Sample ULBs were selected based on their representation of the 25 project ULBs, geographic location (indicating \ninfrastructure requirement characteristics),  availability of  existing infrastructure facilities, and presence of multiple \nsubprojects. \n5  ADB. 1995.

The  implementing  agencies,  the  PMU,  and  the  consultants  for  project  preparation  and \nimplementation  will  include  social  development  specialists  familiar  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  and \nprocedures  for  preparing  subproject  resettlement  plans.  Resettlement  plans  will  comply  with \nnational polices, ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement3 and other social safeguard guidelines, \nand the resettlement framework. The resettlement plans for sample subprojects will be used as \nmodels for preparing and implementing other subproject resettlement plans. Approval of subproject \nresettlement  plans  by  ADB  and  compensation  prior  to  displacement  will  be  conditions  for \ncontracting civil works.  \n \n8.  The executing agency and implementing agencies, through the PMU, will ensure that the \nresettlement framework is closely followed when a resettlement plan for a subproject is formulated. \nThe executing agency will further ensure that adequate resettlement budgets are delivered on time \nto the PMU and implementing agencies and that NGOs are involved sufficiently ahead of time for \ntimely implementation of the resettlement plan. \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n9.  The Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) is the \nexecuting  agency  responsible  for  implementing  the  Investment  Program.  The  implementing \nagencies will be the Investment Program ULBs; the Karnataka Urban Slum Clearance Board; the \nDirectorate  of  Municipal  Administration;  the  Department  of  Information,  Tourism,  and  Youth \nServices; Karnataka State Fire and Emergency Services; the Lake Development Authority; the \nKarnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board; and the KUIDFC. A special land acquisition \nofficer  at  the  PMU  and  land  acquisition  officers  at  the  divisional  offices  will  coordinate  land \nacquisition and resettlement activities. Resettlement officers at each ULB and implementing NGOs \nwill be responsible for resettlement plan implementation. Further details on agencies responsible for \nresettlement plan activities are in Table A12.3.  \n                                                 \n1  Shifting assistance will be a one-time payment based on the amount of property to be moved and the distance. \nAlternatively, the ULB may provide free transport facilities. \n2  Resettlement is significant when 200 or more people experience major impacts. Major impacts are defined as affected \npersons being physically displaced from housing and/or losing 10% or more of their productive, income-generating \nassets. \n3  ADB. 1995.

Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n10.  Resettlement  plans  were  prepared  in  consultation  with  stakeholders.  Discussions  and \nmeetings were held involving stakeholders, particularly affected households, and a socioeconomic \nsurvey was conducted to determine the potential impacts of land acquisition. Information has been \nand continues to be disseminated to affected persons. Local language versions of the resettlement \nplans and resettlement framework have been made available in ULB offices and disclosed on the \nKUIDFC\u2019s web site. The resettlement framework and resettlement plans for sample Investment \nProgram ULBs have been disclosed on ADB\u2019s web site. Finalized resettlement plans will also be \ndisclosed  on  ADB\u2019s  web  site,  and  information  dissemination  and  consultation  will  continue \nthroughout implementation of the Investment Program. \n11.  Grievances by affected persons will first be brought to the attention of the implementing \nNGO or resettlement officer. Grievances not redressed by the NGO or the resettlement officer will \nbe brought to the grievance redress committee established in each Investment Program district. \nMembers of the grievance redress committees will include representatives of affected persons \n(including vulnerable households), the ULB, the KUIDFC, NGOs, community-based organizations, \nand contractors. The committees will meet every 2 weeks, determine the merits of each grievance, \nand resolve grievances within a month of receiving the complaint, failing which the grievance will be \n ", "66   Appendix 12 \naddressed by the deputy commissioner. The deputy commissioners will also hear appeals against \ncommittee decisions. Grievances that remain unresolved will be referred by affected persons to \nappropriate courts of law. Records will be kept of all grievances, including contact details of the \ncomplainant, date that the complaint was received, nature of the grievance, agreed corrective \nactions and the date these were effected, and final outcome. \nF.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n12.  Resettlement plan implementation will be closely monitored to provide the PMU with an \neffective basis for assessing the progress of resettlement and identifying potential difficulties and \nproblems. Internal monitoring will be undertaken by the ULB to track indicators, such as the number \nof families affected and resettled, the assistance extended, the infrastructure facilities provided, and \nthe financial aspects of the resettlement (such as compensation paid and grants extended). Job \ncharts will indicate the targets to be achieved during the month and these will be given to the \nresettlement officer. Monthly progress reports will be prepared and submitted to the PMU reporting \nactual achievements against the job chart targets and reasons for shortfalls, if any. The PMU will be \nresponsible for managing and maintaining databases on affected persons, documenting the results \nof the census of affected persons, and verifying asset and socioeconomic survey data that will be \nused as the baseline for assessing the resettlement plans\u2019 implementation impacts. The PMU will \nappoint an independent agency to undertake external monitoring to document (i) the restoration of \nincome levels; (ii) the changes and shifts in occupation patterns; (iii) the changes in affected \npersons\u2019 type of housing; and (iv) the performance of NGOs, ULBs, and the PMU in resettlement \nimplementation. The independent agency will also assess affected persons\u2019 access to amenities \nsuch as water, electricity, and transportation. The independent agency will monitor subprojects \ntwice a year and submit reports directly to the PMU. The PMU will submit all external monitoring \nreports to ADB for review.  \n \nG.  Resettlement Budget \n \n13.  Detailed  budget  estimates  for  involuntary  resettlement  will  be  prepared  for  each \nresettlement plan by the KUIDFC and the implementing agencies. The estimates will be included in \noverall subproject estimates. The budget will include (i) detailed costs of land acquisition, relocation, \nand livelihood and income restoration and improvement; (ii) source of funding; (iii) arrangements for \napproval; and (iv) flow of funds and contingency arrangements. Overall costs are estimated at \nRs278.36 million. All land acquisition funds will be provided by the KUIDFC. Land acquisition, \ncompensation, relocation, and rehabilitation of incomes and livelihoods will be considered to be an \nintegral component of Investment Program costs. \n ", "  Appendix 13  67 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \n \nA.  Introduction and Description of the Investment Program \n1.  The Investment Program will facilitate economic growth in towns of north Karnataka and \nbring  about  urban  development  by  means  of  equitable  distribution  of  urban  services  in  an \nenvironmentally sound and operationally sustainable manner. The Investment Program will help the \nGovernment of Karnataka (GoK) rehabilitate and construct urban infrastructure, including water \nsupply systems, sewerage systems, drainage, and urban road improvements through resurfacing \nand junction improvements. It will have poverty reduction, institutional development, investment \nprogram  assistance,1  and  nonmunicipal  infrastructure2  components.  An  initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE)  (Supplementary  Appendix  K)  and  IEEs  for  subprojects3  in  three  Investment \nProgram ULBs (Haveri, Hospet, and Raichur) (Supplementary Appendixes J1 to J3) were prepared. \nIEEs were based on field surveys, secondary information, and discussions with stakeholders.  \nB.  Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n2.  Sector Impacts. The Investment Program is designed to maximize environmental benefits. \nNet environmental impacts are positive and large, including (i) improved quality of drinking water \nfrom water supply investments; (ii) improved surface and groundwater quality; (iii) improved public \nhealth as a result of water supply, sanitation, and drainage investments; (iv) reduced flooding as a \nresult of drainage investments; (v) reduced volume of suspended particulates in the air as a result of \nimproved roads; and (vi) increased social benefits from community participation and investments in \nnonmunicipal infrastructure. Negative impacts of some components, notably the sewage treatment \nplants, will not be significant considering the scale of the Investment Program and the mitigation \nmeasures that will be incorporated in designs (Supplementary Appendix N). \n3.  Subproject Impacts. Subproject selection will ensure that the Investment Program will not \nhave  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  or  impacts  on  environmentally  sensitive  areas. \nImpacts that are potentially severe and permanent in nature have been identified, and the criteria for \nsubproject selection will result in the rejection of subprojects with such impacts (Supplementary \nAppendix N). Potential adverse environmental impacts are mostly localized and temporary. These \nimpacts can largely be avoided through proper subproject design (particularly in relation to siting) or \nmitigated  by  means  of  proper  mitigation  measures  and  environmental  management.  Potential \nadverse impacts and mitigation measures are summarized in Table A13.1 (details in Supplementary \nAppendixes M1 to M3).  \nTable A13.1: Potential Adverse Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures \nCategory  Potential Adverse Impact  Severity  Duration  Mitigation Measures \nA.

Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n4.  The Karnataka Urban Infrastructure Development and Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) is the \nexecuting agency and is responsible for implementing the Investment Program through a Program \nManagement Unit (PMU). Four divisional offices will assist the PMU. The implementing agencies will ", "  Appendix 13  69 \nbe the Investment Program urban local bodies (ULBs); the Karnataka Urban Slum Clearance Board; \nthe Directorate of Municipal Administration; the Department of Information, Tourism, and Youth \nServices; Karnataka State Fire and Emergency Services; the Lake Development Authority; the \nKarnataka Urban Water Supply and Drainage Board; and the KUIDFC. An environmental engineer \nin each ULB will be responsible for environmental assessment, monitoring, and management.4  \n \n5.  Environmental monitoring plans in the IEEs identify environmental monitoring activities to \nensure that negative environmental impacts are addressed. The IEEs also identify agencies and \ninstitutions  responsible  for  monitoring  and  provide  indicative  monitoring  costs  (Supplementary \nAppendixes M1 to M3). The PMU will undertake monitoring during preconstruction work. The PMU \nwill  be  responsible  for  providing  technical  approval  for  subprojects  after  verifying  designs  and \nincorporating  mitigation  measures  into  design  and  contract  documents.  During  construction, \nmonitoring will largely be undertaken by contractors and ULBs. The ULBs will monitor contractors\u2019 \nenvironmental  performance.  During  the  operational  stage,  monitoring  will  continue  to  be  the \nresponsibility of ULBs. Third-party monitoring will be undertaken by relevant government agencies, \nsuch as pollution control boards. \n \n6.  The  ULBs  will  prepare  progress  reports  on  all  aspects  of  environmental  assessment, \nmanagement, and monitoring. Independent monitoring will be undertaken by academic or research \ninstitutions with experience in environmental assessment that the KUIDFC will engage to carry out \nexternal  monitoring  of  the  environmental  assessment  and  management  process  for  the  entire \nInvestment Program. External monitoring will be carried out twice a year during implementation of \nthe Investment Program. Reports will be submitted to the KUIDFC and the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for review. During review missions, ADB will also assess environmental compliance with \nADB\u2019s Environmental Policy.5  \n \nD.  Public Consultation and Disclosure \n \n7.  During preparation of the Investment Program, consultations were undertaken with various \nstakeholder  groups,  including  representatives  of  local  governments,  government  agencies, \nnongovernment organizations, urban residents, and affected persons. These consultations were \nconducted at various levels (Investment Program level,6 ULB level,7 and subproject level8) and took \nthe  form  of  workshops,  individual  and  focus  group  discussions,  and  surveys.  Community \nparticipation was ensured through a sample survey. During preparation of the resettlement plan, \nthose affected by land acquisition for sewage treatment plants in all three ULBs were consulted and \npotential environmental impacts for proposed sewage treatment plants, safeguards, and impact \nmitigation  measures  were  disclosed  during  the  consultations.  During  detailed  design,  more \ninformation will be disclosed and public awareness programs will be conducted. The IEEs will be \ntranslated into the local language and presented by means of public notices at ULB offices and the \nmass media. They will also be posted on the KUIDFC web site. Information dissemination and \nconsultation will continue throughout implementation of the Investment Program. \n \nE.  Findings, Recommendations, and Conclusion \n \n8.  The IEEs show that subprojects in sample Investment Program ULBs will result in large net \nenvironmental benefits and will not generate significant adverse environmental impacts. Potential \nadverse environmental impacts are largely temporary and localized and can be addressed through \nsubproject design and mitigation measures. No further assessment of environmental impacts is \nrequired for subprojects in sample Investment Program ULBs.  \n \n                                                 \n4  ULB environmental engineers have recently been recruited based on the Government\u2019s revised Cadre and Recruitment \nPolicy, to ensure compliance with requirements for all urban infrastructure projects particularly solid waste management. \nThe KUIDFC, through the PMU will provide support to the ULB environmental engineers in environmental management. \nTraining for ULB environmental engineers will be in the form of support during subproject design and implementation \nfrom the PMU, program consultants, and the Pollution Control Board. \n5  ADB. 2002.
