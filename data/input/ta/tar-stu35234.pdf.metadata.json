INTRODUCTION\n1. International trade has always been a key issue for the Asian Development Bank\u2019s\n(ADB) developing member countries (DMCs). Without the ability to penetrate the world markets,\nthe newly industrialized economies (Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea; Singapore; and\nTaipei,China) could not have achieved per capita income levels approaching those of developed\ncountries, enabling them to eliminate poverty according to the dollar-a-day poverty criterion. Nor\ncould the Southeast Asian economies subsequently, and India and People\u2019s Republic of China\n(PRC) most recently, have achieved high rates of growth and lifted millions of people out of\npoverty.\n2. If DMCs are to continue to prosper, it is critical that the world markets as well as their\nown markets continue to open up. Protectionist threats to reverse past liberalization in DMCs\nand the rest of the world must be countered. It is with this central, overall objective that the\npresent regional technical assistance (RETA) is being launched.1 The RETA will help raise\nawareness of the policy issues and challenges posed for DMCs at different stages of trade\nliberalization,  and  will  enhance  their  capacity  to  promote  trade  liberalization  conducive  to\neconomic growth and poverty reduction. It will also help raise ADB\u2019s profile and leadership role\nin trade policy debates.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. The last major ADB study on the global trading environment was launched almost eight\nyears ago.2 At that time, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was about to\ncome  into  force,  while  the  Uruguay  Round  Agreement  on  multilateral  trade  was  nearing\nconclusion. Since 1993, several developments have taken place that raise new and important\npolicy issues for DMCs. The first and immediate development is that a new round of trade\nnegotiations  may  be  launched  at  the  Fourth  Ministerial  Conference  of  the  World  Trade\nOrganization (WTO) in Qatar in November 2001. Major differences among member countries at\nthe Third Ministerial Conference of WTO in Seattle in 1999 led to the breakdown of efforts to\nlaunch such a round. According to the latest reports available, these differences appear to be\nnarrowing  down.  The  European  Union  (EU)  and  the  United  States  (US)  appear  willing  to\ncompromise  on  the  language  on  agriculture.  And  there  even  appears  to  be  room  for\ncompromise on the most contentious issue of linking trade and labor standards.3 Even if the\nefforts to launch the round in Qatar fail, such a round is bound to be launched in another year or\ntwo. DMCs have much at stake in this and need technical assistance (TA) both for developing\ntheir  positions  on  the  negotiating  agenda  itself  in  the  immediate  future  and  for  actual\nnegotiations subsequently.\n4. The second new development is continued proliferation of preferential trade area (PTA)\narrangements, which lower trade barriers between two or more countries but leave them intact\nagainst other countries. NAFTA played a catalytic role in triggering the ongoing wave of PTAs.\nSince  the  conclusion  of  NAFTA,  a  large  number  of  such  arrangements  have  come  into\n                  \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in July 2001.\n2 RETA 5551: A Study of the Emerging Trading Environment: Economic Implications for Developing Member\nCountries, for $350,000, approved on 4 November 1993.\n3  According to a recent report entitled \u201cEU urges full speed on new trade round\u201d in the Financial Times (18 July\n2001), the EU Commission is poised to caution against attempts to include labor standards in WTO. In parallel, the\nUS Trade Representative has stated that the EU and the US \u201care developing an increasing degree of convergence\non a strong and balanced agenda\u201d for the WTO Fourth Ministerial Conference in Qatar.", "2\nexistence within Latin America and Europe and between the EU and countries in Eastern and\nCentral Europe and North Africa. The EU has gone so far in this direction that its most favored\nnation (MFN) tariff applies to only five countries.4 WTO reports that it has been informed of more\nthan 80 PTAs since the conclusion of NAFTA. There are also plans to launch the Free Trade\nArea of the Americas, which will turn the entire Western Hemisphere into a single trade bloc.\n5. Since PTAs are by and large among countries outside Asia, the market access of ADB\u2019s\nDMCs has been inevitably adversely affected. When Mexico receives tariff- and quota-free\naccess to the US market, it has an obvious adverse impact on the access available to ADB\u2019s\nDMCs. What are the costs of this decline in market access, and what can the DMCs do about\nit? Should DMCs push harder for multilateral liberalization so that the marginal benefit of tariff\npreference among member countries within a PTA declines? Should DMCs form trade blocs of\ntheir own to counter these effects? These are some of the questions related to PTAs that the\nRETA will attempt to answer.\n6. The third important recent development has been the possible entry of the PRC (to be\nfollowed by the entry of Taipei,China) into WTO in the near future. This entry will result in major\nliberalization of the PRC economy as well as increased market access for the PRC to the EU\nand US markets. The natural question is how this entry will affect the PRC itself and other\nDMCs. On the one hand, further opening of the PRC market will create new opportunities for\nother DMCs. But on the other hand, they will face more intense competition against the PRC in\nthird markets such as the EU and the US. DMCs need to develop an understanding of how to\nmeet this challenge and what internal policy adjustments are needed to make themselves more\ncompetitive.\n7. The final development is the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98. The crisis has had effects\non the region\u2019s trade flows and trade liberalization policies that have not been fully analyzed and\nunderstood. Has trade liberalization in the region slowed down? Is the region more vulnerable in\nthe area of trade due to financial vulnerability?\n8. Within the context of this broad set of developments, a large number of policy questions\nmust be addressed. The objectives and detailed scope of policy issues to be addressed by the\nRETA are outlined in the next section.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n9. The RETA has two broad objectives. First, it will assist ADB\u2019s DMCs in policymaking\nthrough the analysis of policy issues raised by the likely launching of a new round of multilateral\ntrade negotiations under WTO and the rapid proliferation of PTAs within and outside the Asia\nand Pacific region. Second, the RETA will help raise the DMCs\u2019 capacities in trade negotiations\nand policy analysis. The TA framework is shown in Appendix 1.\n                  \n4  The MFN tariff of a country on a commodity is the one to which it commits under its obligations under the General\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade of WTO. This tariff applies nondiscriminatorily to all WTO members. But\npreferences under PTAs result in lower tariffs being applied to PTA members, thereby creating discrimination\nagainst nonmembers.", "3\nB.  Scope\n10. Issues to be addressed under the RETA in preparation for the next round of multilateral\ntrade negotiations include the following:\n(i)  Implication of New WTO round for DMCs. If and when a new WTO round of\nnegotiations is launched, an important question is, What should be the stance of\nADB\u2019s DMCs on trade liberalization in industrial goods, agriculture, and services?\nTo assist the DMCs in entering into a profitable bargain in the negotiation, there\nis need to undertake systematic documentation of what barriers remain in DMCs\nand other countries, and in-depth analyses of potential benefits for DMCs of\nfurther  trade  liberalization  and  how  the  benefit  will  be  affected  by  different\nprocesses of liberalization in these goods and services.\n(ii)  PRC\u2019s Entry into WTO. The PRC\u2019s entry (followed by the entry of Taipei,China)\nwill have significant impact on its economy as well as on the economies of other\nDMCs. The RETA will examine the potential changes in the PRC\u2019s policy and\nregulatory regimes to be brought about by the entry agreements, and will make a\nquantitative  and  qualitative  assessment  of  the  impact  on  selected  DMC\neconomies.\n(iii)  Intellectual  Property  Rights.  There  are  some  outstanding  issues  from  the\nUruguay  Round  of  multilateral  trade  negotiations  that  may  bring  intellectual\nproperty rights back onto the negotiating agenda of the next round. In such a\ncase, what should be the stance of the DMCs? In addition, and perhaps more\nimportantly, there remain major implementation issues for many DMCs in this\narea. The RETA will look into this issue carefully.\n(iv)  Labor Standards. The issue of labor standards, including child labor and worker\nrights, will remain with the DMCs irrespective of whether or not it appears on the\nagenda of the next round of WTO negotiations. At best, it will be relegated to the\nInternational Labor Organization, which will be asked to take it up in conjunction\nwith the WTO or the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.\nEither way, there is need to examine the potential impact on DMCs of linking\nlabor standards and other nontrade issues such as environment and product\nlabeling in the next round of WTO negotiations.\n(v)  Investment Agreement. There remain pressures to incorporate an investment\nagreement into WTO. If this subject does get included into the agenda of the next\nround, DMCs have much at stake. Precisely what kind of investments (direct\nforeign  investment,  portfolio  investment,  and/or  short-term  capital)  should  be\nincluded? What form should such an agreement take? Since DMCs are importers\nof capital and potential exporters of labor on a net basis, should they not be\ngranted liberalization in the labor area by developed countries in return?\n(vi)  Competition  Policy  and  Antidumping  Measures.  With  the  liberalization  of\ntariffs  following  the  Uruguay  Round,  the  use  of  antidumping  measures  has\nbecome rampant. DMCs face increased use of these measures not only in the\nEU and the US but also in other DMCs. Some DMCs have themselves emerged\nas major users of antidumping measures. The impact and possible policy reforms\nin this area need to be studied.", "4\n(vii)  E-commerce.5 Rules and regulations governing trade through e-commerce will\ninevitably become part of the next round of WTO negotiations. The RETA will\ncarefully examine the nature and potential benefit of trade through e-commerce,\nand will recommend the DMCs\u2019 position in negotiating WTO rules with respect to\ne-commerce.\n(viii)  Dispute Settlement. The new round will also consider the reform of the dispute\nsettlement process in WTO. How DMCs can maximize benefits in this area\nneeds to be considered.\n11. Policy issues and challenges related to PTA arrangements will be tackled from the\nfollowing angles:\n(i)  differences between PTAs and the multilateral approach to trade liberalization in\nterms of their impact on industry structure, international trade flows, economic\ngrowth, and poverty reduction;\n(ii)  proliferation of PTAs and implications for the multilateral trading systems under\nWTO; and\n(iii)  strategies and policy actions required to preserve DMC access to markets in\nregions with PTAs, including examining the pros and cons of actively forming\nPTAs among DMCs themselves and with economies in other regions.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n12. The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $550,000. The cost estimates include the\nhonoraria and travel expenses of international and domestic resource persons; conferences,\nseminars and training workshops; and publication and other dissemination activities. The TA will\nbe financed by ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program. Details of the cost\nestimates are given in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n13. ADB will be the Executing Agency of the RETA. ADB\u2019s Economics and Development\nResource  Center,  in  consultation  with  the  Programs  Departments,  will  be  responsible  for\nimplementing the RETA under the overall supervision of its Director and Chief Economist.\n14. The study will be carried out in two phases over a period of 20 months. The first phase\nwill be the preparation of a set of papers by renowned international resource persons to sharpen\nthe policy issues raised in paras. 10-11 and develop the analytical framework to guide country-\nspecific studies to be carried out in the second phase. Twelve international resource persons\nwith expertise in international trade and economic growth, development economics, regional\neconomic cooperation, and trade negotiations will be engaged. The outline terms of reference\nfor the international resource persons are given in Appendix 3.\n15. The second phase will examine the implications of PTAs and a new round of WTO\nnegotiations for individual DMCs. Tentatively, DMCs involved in this phase of study include\nBangladesh, PRC, Fiji, India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. This list was determined in consultation\nwith the Programs Departments and the Office of Pacific Operations. The outline terms of\nreference for domestic resource persons to prepare the country studies are given in Appendix 3.\n                  \n5  E-commerce or electronic commerce is the conduct of financial transactions by electronic means.", "5\nThis  phase  will  start  with  an  inception  workshop  to  discuss  the  papers  prepared  by  the\ninternational resource persons. It will also determine the scope of country studies in light of the\ninternational  resource  persons\u2019  studies  and  the  policy  issues  confronting  individual  DMCs.\nSenior DMC policymakers and potential domestic resource persons (12 in all) will be invited to\nattend the workshop. Implementation of the study may require a local technical assistant, who\nwill be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n16. A finalization conference will be held to discuss the outputs of the RETA. Subsequently,\noutputs of the RETA will be more widely disseminated through seminars and training activities in\nthe selected DMCs.\n17. The RETA will commence in October 2001 and will be completed by December 2003.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n18. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$550,000 for the purpose of a study on Regional Integration and Trade: Emerging Policy Issues\nfor Selected Developing Member Countries, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "6     Appendix 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Performance Monitoring Assumptions\nIndicators/Targets Mechanisms and Risks\nGoals\n\u2022  Openness to trade in \u2022  Increased awareness of \u2022  Increased support for\ndeveloping member developmental impact of openness through\ncountries (DMCs) and different processes of trade trade\ncountries in other liberalization \u2022  Increased debates on\nregions \u2022  Increase in DMCs as WTO nontrade-related\n\u2022  Enhanced DMC members issues and implications\ncapacities in trade \u2022  A new round of WTO of linking them to trade\nnegotiations negotiations with increased negotiations\n\u2022  Training for DMCs, emphasis on DMC concerns\nparticularly those not and interests\nyet members of the\nWorld Trade\nOrganization (WTO)\nPurposes\n\u2022  Prepare DMCs for the \u2022  Wide dissemination of the \u2022  Growing resistance to \u2022  Broad acceptance of\nlikely launch of a new regional technical assistance linking nontrade issues positive linkage\nround of WTO outputs that address policy to WTO negotiations between openness to\nnegotiations issues and challenges posed \u2022  Growing resistance of trade, and sustainable\n\u2022  Prepare DMCs for for DMCs by the likely launch PTA proposals that are growth and poverty\nembracing the of a new round of WTO incompatible with the reduction\nchallenges of negotiation and proliferation of multilateral approach \u2022  PTAs are not\nproliferation of PTAs to trade liberalization considered as a political\npreferential trade tool to counter the\narea (PTA) proliferation of PTAs in\narrangements other regions\nOutputs\n\u2022  Issues papers \u2022  Timely invitation of qualified \u2022  Dissemination of the \u2022  Failure to invite\nprepared by international resource persons publication international resource\ninternational resource \u2022  Timely submission of draft \u2022  Organization of policy persons who are trade\npersons outlines and reports forums and training economists and have\n\u2022  Country papers \u2022  Inception/finalization workshops in DMCs strong development\nprepared by domestic conference that is well perspective\nresource persons responded to by DMC senior \u2022  Failure to invite\n\u2022  Publication based on officials domestic resource\nthese papers \u2022  Circulation of conference persons who have\nsynopsis strong trade\n\u2022  Launching of publication that backgrounds and are\nreceives extensive media aware of issues facing\ncoverage and favorable book their respective DMCs\nreview in multilateral trade\nnegotiations\nActivities/Inputs\n\u2022  Prepare the terms of \u2022  Inception workshop \u2022  Inability to reach\nreference and Invite \u2022  Finalization conference agreement on terms of\ninternational resource \u2022  Publications reference with resource\npersons \u2022  Training seminars persons\n\u2022  Review draft papers \u2022  Quality of the issues\n\u2022  Organize the papers and country\ninception workshop; studies is poor and\ntraining; and other unpublishable\ndissemination\nactivities\n(Reference in text: page 2, para. 9)", "7 Appendix 2\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($)\nItem Total\nCost\n1.
