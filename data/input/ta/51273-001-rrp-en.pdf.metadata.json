I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed equity \ninvestment of up to $75,000,000 (or its equivalent in baht) to Gulf Energy Development Public \nCompany Limited (Gemstone) for the Cornerstone Investment in Leading Independent Power \nProducer Project in Thailand. The report also describes the proposed administration of an equity \ninvestment of up to $45,000,000 (or its equivalent in baht) to be provided by the Leading Asia\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Infrastructure Fund (LEAP),1 and if the Board approves the proposed equity \ninvestment, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the administration \nof the equity investment. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Project Identification and Description \n2.  Project identification. Since the discovery of large reserves in the late 1970s, natural \ngas from the Gulf of Thailand has provided the Thai economy with an abundant, low-cost, and \nsecure source of energy. Approximately 65% of Thailand\u2019s electricity is produced from natural \ngas and over 50% of demand for electricity in the country is attributed to the industrial sector. \nNatural gas has been an integral factor in fueling Thailand\u2019s successful industrial transformation \ninto a major export-orientated manufacturing hub within Southeast Asia. Thailand has become a \nworld-class  supplier  of  machinery,  consumer  electronics,  high-tech  components,  and \nautomotives\u2014all of which are well integrated into regional and global production networks. \nThailand promotes investment and growth in its industrial sector by establishing industrial parks \nat strategic locations in the country with fully equipped infrastructure facilities and services such \nas roads, water supply, waste treatment, telecommunications, and electricity supply. Reliable and \ncompetitively priced electricity is supplied to industrial customers through Thailand\u2019s distributed \ngeneration model, whereby power plants are located on or near the industrial estates. Building \npower plants close to the load where electricity is consumed obviates the need for building \nredundant transmission lines and reduces the amount of electricity that is lost when it is delivered \nover a long distance. \n \n3.  The fuel of choice under the distributed generation model has been natural gas, given its \nhigh efficiency and added flexibility in power plant sizing and delivery. Natural gas can serve as \nbaseload, intermediate, and peaking electrical power supply, meeting industrial demand when \nand as needed. The electricity generated from natural gas also produces excess heat to produce \nsteam, which can be utilized by industrial customers for their manufacturing processes. Without \nthis residual heat source, manufacturers would require additional boiler capacity on site that would \nconsume more fuel, needlessly adding emissions in the process. Waste heat can also be used in \nabsorptive chillers to provide year-round cooling services to industrial customers, known as \ntrigeneration  or  combined  heat,  power,  and  cooling.  Natural  gas  generation  also  emits \nsubstantially less greenhouse gas emissions, dust, and ash compared with coal-fired power \nplants, the main alternative fuel choice for industrial parks in Thailand. By utilizing a distributed \ngeneration model with combined-cycle and cogeneration technologies with heat recovery steam \ngenerators, electricity is produced more efficiently and in a more sustainable manner, providing \ncleaner air quality and lower carbon footprint within the industrial centers of Thailand. \n \n4.  Thailand\u2019s rapid industrialization and development fueled by natural gas have increased \nproductivity, job creation, and income for the country. However, due to declining reserves and \ngreater reliance on imports, Thailand must now reprioritize its strategic use of natural gas within \n                                                \n1  Financing partner: Japan International Cooperation Agency. \n ", "2 \nits energy fuel mix from a dominant to a transitioning fuel source to meet its growing demand. \nOver the next 20 years, natural gas will play a central role in helping Thailand transition to a low-\ncarbon economy. It will continue to be a significant component of Thailand\u2019s overall fuel mix and \nit will continue to be the preferred fuel choice over coal in providing electricity to the country\u2019s \nindustrial base. Natural gas will also play a supporting role in helping the country meet its \nrenewable energy targets. By 2036, Thailand plans to integrate 3,002 megawatts (MW) of wind \nand 6,000 MW of solar power generation into the national grid. Natural gas is optimally suited to \ncomplement intermittent electricity generation from wind and solar through its ability to rapidly \nscale production up or down on short notice to meet load requirements. This allows the system \noperator to balance load in a more effective and efficient manner that is not possible with coal \nand nuclear or seasonal hydro imports. \n \n5.  The Ministry of Energy implements its distributed generation model for industrial users \nthrough  the  small  power  producers  (SPPs)  program  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  through  the \nindependent power producers (IPPs) and very small power producers (VSPPs) programs. The \nIPP program, with installed capacities greater than 90 MW, the SPP program with installed \ncapacities in the 10 MW\u201390 MW range, and the VSPP program with installed capacities less than \n10 MW, allow private sector developers to build, own, and operate power plants and enter into a \npower  purchase  agreement  (PPA)  with  the  state-owned  Electricity  Generating  Authority  of \nThailand (EGAT) in the case of the IPP and SPP programs, and with the Provincial Electricity \nAuthority (PEA) or Metropolitan Electricity Authority in the case of the VSPP program. The Ministry \nof Energy allows for any additional capacity from power plants to be directly sold to industrial \ncustomers through energy supply agreements. SPPs can also sell their excess steam to industrial \ncustomers that are located within close proximity to the power plant. Power plants located within \nindustrial estates provide the power system with added reliability and security of supply for \nelectricity consumers. \n \n6.  The proposed investment in Gemstone, one of the largest IPPs in Thailand, supports the \ngeneral  expansion  of  power  generation  in  the  country,  especially  in  servicing  industrial \nconsumers. From 2007 to 2017, Gemstone has been highly successful in securing the largest \npipeline of IPP and SPP projects in Thailand through the government\u2019s competitive solicitation \nand proposals for new generation. At this time, the company is seeking an initial public offering \n(IPO) to raise funds in support of its current pipeline of projects and to expand its business into \nnew growth opportunities. Raising funds through an IPO provides the private sector with greater \naccess to capital in an efficient and cost-effective manner, enabling it to undertake more and \nlarger investments in infrastructure projects. Gemstone is one of the largest private sector clients \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with a longstanding relationship since 2007 when ADB \nsupported the company during its first IPP bidding process.2 \n \n7.  Project design. Gemstone has a substantial number of projects under development and \nin construction, including (i) 2 gas-fired IPPs (5,570 MW), (ii) 11 gas-fired SPPs (1,427 MW), and \n(iii) 1 biomass SPP (25 MW). \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n                                                \n2  ADB provided long-term debt for two of Gemstone\u2019s independent power producer (IPP) projects, the Nong-Saeng \nNatural Gas Power Project and the Ayudhaya Natural Gas Power Project (1,600 MW each), which represented the \nfirst project financing arrangements in Thailand with loan tenures of 23 years. The Nong-Saeng Project was \nrecognized as one of the top 40 Public-Private Partnerships in Emerging Markets by the International Finance \nCorporation and Infrastructure Journal, and the Ayudhaya Project received Project Finance Deal of the Year (2012) \nfrom Project Finance International. \n ", "  3 \n \n8.  Thailand is the second largest energy consumer in Southeast Asia, and over the next 20 \nyears the country must retire approximately 24,000 MW of capacity due to aging and inefficient \nplants, and add approximately 51,500 MW of new capacity between 2016 and 2036 to meet \ngrowing demand. Thailand will effectively more than double its current installed capacity of 30,218 \nMW with new power generation. In addition to its current projects under development and \nconstruction, Gemstone will continue to expand its power project portfolio domestically through \ntenders and proposals for the IPP, SPP, and VSPP programs. The company will also seek growth \nopportunities to expand its renewable energy generation profile, and explore other opportunities \noutside of Thailand where it can leverage its proven track record in Thailand. This will help \ndiversify the company\u2019s source of revenue and sustain the growth of its business operations. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n9.  Investee. Gemstone\u2019s business has been primarily focused on developing natural gas \npower generation in Thailand under the IPP and SPP programs. Currently, 99% of the company\u2019s \nportfolio consists of natural gas power generation, and the majority of the projects are located in \nor near industrial estates in Thailand. Since 2007, the company has submitted and won bids and \nproposals under the IPP, SPP, and VSPP solicitation programs in Thailand for a total of 28 \nprojects, of which 23 are based within industrial estates.  \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n10.  In  line  with  the  government  strategy  to  transition  towards  a  low-carbon  economy, \nGemstone has begun developing renewable energy projects. The company currently has four \nrooftop-solar solar projects in operation located in industrial parks and is currently developing a \nbiomass power project in Southern Thailand. The company also acquired a 9.09% equity interest \nin SPCG,3 one of the largest solar power companies in Thailand with 260 MW of installed \ngeneration. As part of Gemstone\u2019s growth and diversification strategy, the company will pursue \nmore renewable energy generation projects in the future. \n \n11.  Integrity due diligence was conducted.4 No significant or potentially significant integrity \nrisks were identified. Enhanced tax integrity due diligence was also conducted.5 ADB\u2019s review of \nthe entity does not give ADB cause to believe that such entity has been established or is being \nused for cross-border tax evasion, money laundering, or terrorism financing in the jurisdictions \ninvolved in the project. \n \nB.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n12.  Impact. The project is aligned with the following impact: Thailand\u2019s installed power \ngeneration capacity from natural gas utilizing combined-cycle and cogeneration technologies \nincreased. \n \n13.  Outcome. The project will increase the supply of affordably priced and clean power to the \ndomestic grid. \n                                                \n3   SPCG Public Company Limited.  \n4   ADB. 2003.

The outputs will be additional power plants installed or developed, and local \nemployment generated. \n \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n15.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020,6 which reaffirmed ADB\u2019s support for (i) the role of the \nprivate sector in meeting growing demand for clean energy in the region; (ii) poverty reduction by \nsupporting  rapid  and  inclusive  growth;  (iii)  capitalizing  on  ADB\u2019s  operating  strengths  in \ninfrastructure development and finance; and (iv) supporting public\u2013private partnership initiatives. \n \n16.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s latest country partnership strategy for Thailand, \n2013\u20132016, as well as its country operations business plan, 2017\u20132019, both of which prioritize: \n(i) increasing clean power generation capacity, (ii) increasing efficiency of energy generation, (iii) \npublic\u2013private partnerships, and (iv) development of capital markets. \n \n17.  Consistency  with  sector  strategy  and  relevant  ADB  operations.  The  project  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Energy Policy, 7 which gives emphasis to investments in energy efficiency, \nleast-cost supply, private sector participation, and wider access to the poor. ADB supports \nprojects that utilize efficient technologies, such as combined cycle, and projects that incorporate \nstate-of-the-art emission control equipment. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  Table 2 summarizes the implementation arrangements.8 \n \nTable 2: Summary of Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nRegulatory  The IPP and SPP programs allow for private developers to build, own, and operate power \ngeneration projects in the 10 MW\u201390 MW installed capacity range in the case of SPP, and \nframework \ngreater than 90 MW in the case of IPPs. IPP and SPP projects enter into long-term PPAs \nwith EGAT for up to 25 years. The VSPP program allows for private developers to build, \nown, and operate small power projects up to 10 MW of installed generating capacity. VSPPs \nsell their electricity to the state-owned distribution utilities\u2014Metropolitan Electricity Authority, \nand Provincial Electricity Authority\u2014under 5-year automatically renewable PPAs. \nOfftake arrangements  Different tariff structures are applied based on the type of electricity-generating program \n(IPP, SPP, or VSPP), whether the contract is firm or non-firm (non-firm meaning minimum \nofftake obligations), and whether the project utilizes conventional or renewable energy. IPP \nand firm SPP power projects are entitled to receive an availability payment (called capacity \npayment in the case of SPP) for making its contracted power generation capacity available \nto EGAT. IPP and firm SPPs are also entitled to receive an energy payment to cover fuel \ncosts and other variable costs. Non-firm renewable energy SPPs receive the wholesale base \nrate with fuel adjustment in addition to a fixed feed-in tariff. In addition to PPAs with EGAT, \ngas-fired SPPs may enter into energy supply agreements with industrial users for \napproximately 20%\u201330% of their installed capacity with terms of up to 15 years. Pricing is \ngenerally discounted from the Provincial Electricity Authority retail tariff to incentivize \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2014.

Value Added by ADB Assistance \n19.  ADB has been requested by the company to participate in its IPO as a cornerstone \ninvestor.  As  a  cornerstone  investor,  ADB  will  help  facilitate  the  book-building  process  by \nreassuring other potential investors of the merits of the investment. ADB will also help strengthen \nits corporate-wide environmental and social management system (ESMS) in line with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009) and good international practice. Companies engaged in large \ninfrastructure  projects  depend  on  substantial  amounts  of  capital  from  both  domestic  and \ninternational sources. Financiers and investors are increasingly cognizant of the commercial \nimplications  associated  with  environmental  and  social  risks  as  well  as  reputational  risks \nassociated with their investment. The link between strong financial performance and a company\u2019s \ncorporate governance and ability to manage environmental and social risks of its business are \nbecoming more evident in ensuring the long-term corporate sustainability of a company. Providers \nof capital are increasingly rewarding companies that are accountable, transparent, and engage \nstakeholders and the communities in which they operate. \n \n20.  For companies that develop large-scale infrastructure projects in developing countries, an \nESMS can also provide a strategic competitive advantage in securing new projects, raising \ncapital, and improving brand image and reputation. These companies can achieve better growth \nopportunities, cost savings, and boost their bottom line profitability. ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement is globally recognized as a leading benchmark for good environmental and social \nmanagement, and the company will adopt an ADB-compliant ESMS before ADB\u2019s cornerstone \n ", "6 \ninvestment in the IPO.9 The ESMS will strengthen Gemstone\u2019s capacity to mitigate environmental \nand social risks, improve relations with its stakeholders, and achieve greater development impact \nin the countries in which it operates. Further, the ESMS is also expected to help the company \nbecome ISO 14001 certified. \n \nC.  Risks \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \nIV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n21.  The investment is a general corporate finance transaction and is classified as category A \nfor  environment  and  B  for  involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  potential \nenvironmental and social impacts of the investment have been identified and effective measures \nto avoid, minimize, mitigate, and compensate for the adverse impacts are incorporated into the \nsafeguard reports and plans. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n22.  A corporate audit was undertaken by an external third party in accordance with the \nrequirements in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.10 The corporate audit assessed that the \nenvironment, health, and safety (EHS) function is embedded in the business processes of the \ncompany and works very closely with various teams (planning, development, and operations) to \nensure both statutory compliance and management of risks. The EHS teams are staffed with \ndedicated and qualified personnel who have developed a comprehensive set of systems and \nprocedures which govern the overall EHS management at both corporate and subproject levels. \nMonitoring, reporting, and documentation of EHS performance are tracked and integrated into the \nmanagement review system and process of the company. In addition, the company\u2019s subprojects \nwere also certified for International Organization for Standardization systems, demonstrating its \nwillingness to adopt and move towards meeting international standards requirements. \n \nCONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION DELETED  \n \n23.  These and other audit findings and recommendations have been documented and agreed \nin a corrective action plan. In line with the requirements of the corrective action plan, Gemstone \nwill update its ESMS and align it with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. The \nenvironment and social requirements in the ESMS (categorization checklists, initial environmental \nexamination, and environmental impact assessment reports, social audit report, disclosure, and \ninternal as well as third-party reporting) will be mandatory for all future subprojects utilizing the \nADB  proceeds.  The  company  will  also  report  on  a  semiannual  basis  for  projects  under \nconstruction, and on an annual basis thereafter to ADB on ongoing compliance to ESMS and \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement requirements. \n \n24.  Gemstone will comply with national labor laws and, pursuant to ADB\u2019s Social Protection \nStrategy (2001), will take measures to comply with the internationally recognized core labor \n                                                \n9  Gemstone will be required to apply the ESMS in all projects that utilize proceeds from ADB\u2019s investment, and the \ncompany will endeavor to apply the ESMS in all other projects in its portfolio. \n10  The corporate and subprojects audit was undertaken by Environmental Resource Management, a qualified and \nexperienced independent expert. \n ", "  7 \nstandards.11 Gemstone will report on an annual basis to ADB on (i) its compliance with such laws, \nand (ii) the measures taken. Information disclosure and consultation with affected people will be \nconducted in accordance with ADB requirements.12 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n25.  Gemstone was advised of ADB\u2019s policy of implementing best international practice relating \nto combating corruption, money laundering, and the financing of terrorism. ADB will ensure that \nthe investment documentation includes appropriate provisions prohibiting corruption, money \nlaundering, and the financing of terrorism, and remedies for ADB in the event of noncompliance. \n \nC.
