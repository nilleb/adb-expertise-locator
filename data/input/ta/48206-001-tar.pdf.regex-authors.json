INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  Gender  Equality  and  Women\u2019s  Empowerment  Operational  Plan,  2013\u20132020 \n(Gender Operational Plan) and the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) highlight the need for targeted public policies and direct investments in women and \ngirls\u2014alongside  gender  mainstreaming\u2014to  close  remaining  gender  gaps  and  to  tackle \nentrenched gender inequalities in Asia and the Pacific.1 This technical assistance (TA) will help \naccelerate ADB\u2019s efforts to implement the Gender Operational Plan and deliver the directives of \nthe  Strategy  2020  midterm  review  through  pilot  innovations,  better  gender  diagnostics, \nenhanced capacity development, and partnerships. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Asia and Pacific region has made considerable progress in narrowing gender gaps \nin  education,  health,  employment,  and  political  participation.  However,  progress  has  been \nuneven across the region and within countries. Gender inequalities persist, as evidenced by  \ngirls\u2019 secondary completion rates; high maternal and infant mortality rates; women\u2019s  access to \npaid employment; participation in politics and decision-making; and access to land, assets, and \nfinancial services.3  Many women in the region, particularly in rural areas, still lack access to \nbasic infrastructure and services such as water supply, sanitation, electricity, and affordable \ntransportation. Discriminatory social norms and practices remain entrenched across the region, \nconstraining  access  by  women  to  education,  skills  development,  employment,  productive \nresources, and physical mobility. Social norms and longstanding cultural practices are also \npartially responsible for continuing gender-based violence, reverse sex ratios at birth, and the \nhigh prevalence (between 45% and 65%) of early and child marriage, especially in South Asia.4 \nThese cultural and social norms undermine and slow  down progress in advancing gender \nequality. Public policies and targeted programs are needed to close remaining gender gaps and \naccelerate progress in achieving gender equality. \n3.  ADB\u2019s Gender Operational Plan is the guiding framework for ADB\u2019s gender operations to \n2020. Both the Gender Operational Plan and the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 recognize \nthat gender mainstreaming needs to be complemented with more targeted interventions to close \nthe region\u2019s remaining gender gaps. While gender mainstreaming has delivered good results, \nopportunities for direct investment in women and girls are needed in areas such as girls\u2019 \nsecondary education and completion; access to productive assets, jobs, and income-earning \nopportunities;  school-to-work  transition  and  skills  training  for  employment;  business \ndevelopment services for women entrepreneurs; financial services and access to credit; labor-\nsaving technology to reduce women\u2019s time poverty; policy and legal reforms to tackle gender-\nbased violence and gender inequalities; and giving women voice in decision making. \n4.  The  Gender  Operational  Plan  identifies  the  following  priorities  for  achieving  better \ngender equality results: (i) improving the quality of gender analysis, (ii) piloting innovations for \npotential replication, (iii) enhancing gender-related capacity development of developing member \ncountries (DMCs), (iv) improving the knowledge base on gender equality, and (v) strengthening \npartnerships.  \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013.

The TA builds on successful experiences and lessons from regional TA for Promoting \nGender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment, which is scheduled for completion in December \n2014.5 The regional TA served as an implementation facility of the Gender and Development \nCooperation  Fund (GDCF)  and  supported  the  implementation  of  two  previous  gender  and \ndevelopment plans of action.6 It has improved gender equality in the design and results of 78 \nloan and Asian Development Fund grant projects, assisted in the preparation of 12 country \ngender assessments and country partnership strategies, and helped increase the number of \nprojects with gender mainstreaming. Rapid gender assessments of ongoing projects in six \ncountries  funded  under  the  regional  TA  supported  the  development  of  an  assessment \nframework  for  measuring  gender  equality  results  during  project  implementation  and  at \ncompletion.7 The regional TA also contributed to enhancing the gender capacity of executing \nand implementing agencies on project gender action plan (GAP) design and implementation \nthrough flagship lateral learning events covering a range of sectors and themes, including water, \nenvironment, energy, urban, transport, education, food security, and economic empowerment, \nsome of which were conducted with other development partners.  \n6.  Key  lessons  from  the  regional  TA  for  Promoting  Gender  Equality  and  Women\u2019s \nEmpowerment include: (i) the demand-driven approach that provided support when needed \nworked  well  to  assist  ADB\u2019s  operations  departments  to  strengthen  the  design  and \nimplementation  of  project  GAPs;  (ii)  cross-regional  lateral  learning  proved  an  effective \nmechanism  for  both  gender  capacity  development  of  DMC  officials,  and  for  generating \ngovernment ownership of project GAPs; (iii) timely consultant recruitment and fielding following \nsubproject approval must be rigorously monitored to ensure timely startup, implementation, and \ncompletion of subprojects managed by operations departments;8 and (iv) development of a \nproject  performance  reporting  system  is  needed  to  alert  the  management  of  operations \ndepartments  regarding  the  progress  and  performance  of  subprojects.  A  major  constraint \nencountered  under  the  regional  TA  subprojects  was  delays  in  consultant  recruitment  and \nimplementation for subprojects managed by operations departments, which resulted in slow \ncontract awards and fund disbursement. \n \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2003.

Technical Assistance for Promoting Gender Equality and Women\u2019s Empowerment. Manila (TA 6143-\nREG) introduced a cutoff system whereby subproject funds would be cancelled if the consultant recruitment was \nnot complete within 3 months of subproject approval. However, there were cases in which consultant recruitment \nprocess was irreversible after 3 months, due to the commitments made by the governments or other partners. \nUnder the new TA, a more rigorous system will be applied. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be successful delivery of gender equality results in ADB operations in \nDMCs improved. The outcome will be identification and development of direct investments in \nwomen and girls in ADB lending operations increased. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will finance a series of subprojects which will be proposed by staff across ADB in \nconsultation with their DMC counterparts, to support initiatives and activities in the areas of \npriority identified by the Gender Operational Plan. Building on the experience of the previous \nregional TA, the new TA will focus more explicitly on pilot innovations, to identify potential \napproaches  for  addressing  persistent  and  entrenched  gender  inequalities,  which  could  be \nexpanded  and  replicated  in  lending  operations.  The  TA  outputs  will  comprise  priority \nsubprojects, approved on a demand-driven basis, in the following four areas. \n9.  Output 1: Gender equality designs and results in lending operations (informed by \nquality diagnostics) improved. This output will support knowledge and diagnostic activities to \nimprove the quality of project GAPs for better gender equality results. Selective support will be \nprovided for conducting more detailed and thorough gender analysis than the standard project \npreparatory TA,  collection of sex-disaggregated baseline data, provision of additional gender \nanalytical  inputs  and  reviews  during  GAP  implementation,  and  conducting  gender-focused \nproject impact assessments to identify transformative factors for correcting gender disparities. \n10.  Output 2: Pilot initiatives with key lessons for scaling up implemented. Under this \noutput,  TA  subprojects  will  pilot  innovative  approaches  and  interventions  that  address  the \nmultiple dimensions of gender inequality that have a high potential to be scaled up or replicated \nin ADB operations.9 Pilot initiatives may include interventions that reduce the \u201ctime poverty\u201d of \nwomen through basic infrastructure and technology; support girls\u2019  \u201cschool to work transition\u201d; \nfacilitate women\u2019s access to jobs and incomes; promote and facilitate women\u2019s participation in \ndecision-making  bodies;  support  women\u2019s  access  to  social  protection,  legal,  business \ndevelopment, and financial services; and tackle gender-based violence and early and child \nmarriage. Priority will be given to countries or areas with significant gender disparities. \n11.  Output  3:  Gender  knowledge  products  and  services  in  developing  member \ncountries enhanced. Under this output, gender-focused studies will be conducted to identify \nstructural and cultural constraints to gender equality, and formulate strategies and interventions \nto address them. Gender capacity development activities will be conducted that target project \ndirectors,  key  staff  and  gender  focal  points  in  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  and \nnational gender machineries in DMCs. Knowledge events for DMC staff will include cross-\nregional lateral learning events and bilateral exchanges to share and discuss country-specific or \ncross-regional research and studies that may guide future lending operations. Where relevant, \ngender-related capacity development activities will also be conducted for women\u2019s groups, civil \nsociety organizations, and the private sector. \n12.  Output 4: Partnerships on gender equality strengthened. This output will support \nannual consultation meetings with ADB\u2019s External Forum on Gender and Development (EFG) \n                                                \n9 The TA will provide approximately  $110,000 each in support for small-scale pilot activities during the initial stage; \nthis amount may increase as more funding is obtained. \n ", "4  \nand other activities to support the EFG, such as in-country field visits.10 Other priority joint \ngender  initiatives  with  United  Nations  agencies,  Multilateral  Development  Banks  Gender \nWorking  Group,  regional  development  partners,  women\u2019s  organizations,  and  civil  society \norganizations will also be supported. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,100,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGender and Development Cooperation Fund and administered by ADB.11 The cost estimates \nand financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB, through the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), will be \nthe executing agency. The implementation arrangements will follow the established system \nadopted  for  the  ongoing  regional  TA  for  Promoting  Gender  Equality  and  Women\u2019s \nEmpowerment, in accordance with the agreement made with the GDCF financing parties. A \nsimple  two-page  application  form  is  submitted  by  subproject  proponents  (operations  and \nknowledge  departments)  for  review  and  approval  by  the  GDCF  Peer  Review  Committee, \nheaded by the Gender Equity Community of Practice chair. All five subregions of DMCs are \neligible for subproject application. RSDD functions as the secretariat. \n15.  Proposals  are  expected  from  ADB\u2019s  operations  departments  for  country-specific \ninitiatives across all outputs, while cross-regional activities and studies will be developed and \nimplemented by RSDD (cross-regional lateral learning events, regional studies and/or pilot \ninnovations, and the EFG partnership). Subproject proposals generated by ADB\u2019s knowledge \ndepartments will be prepared and implemented in close consultation with the relevant ADB \noperations departments and resident missions. The subproject proponents are responsible for \nobtaining country concurrence, consultant recruitment, implementation, financial management, \nand subproject closing. ADB will finance activities in a DMC under the TA after receiving a no \nobjection from the government of that DMC. The proposed TA will build on and complement \nongoing subregional gender capacity development TA projects that focus on subregion-specific \nactivities currently under implementation by regional departments.12 \n16.  The TA supervising unit will be established in RSDD. The TA will finance one GDCF \ncoordinator,  assisted  by  a  national  administrator  (24  person-months),  to  support  the  TA \nsupervising unit and peer review committee in the overall coordination and implementation of \nthe TA, under the guidance of the Gender Equity Community of Practice chair. Additional short-\nterm international and national consultants with gender and other relevant expertise will be \nengaged to implement subproject activities. Consultants will be recruited as individuals, given \nthe small size of each subproject. Up to 11 person-months of international and 74 person-\nmonths of national consultant services will be engaged (Appendix 3). Output-based contracts \n                                                \n10 Established in 2001, ADB\u2019s External Forum on Gender and Development has served as a mechanism to promote \nand facilitate dialogue between ADB and external groups on gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment issues \nand concerns. The group meets annually and currently comprises six members from governments and the civil \nsociety in DMCs and donors. http://www.adb.org/themes/gender/external-forum. \n11 Financing parties: the governments of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, and Norway. \n12 ADB. 2012.
