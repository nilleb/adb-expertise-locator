THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Air Quality Improvement in the Greater Beijing\u2013\nTianjin\u2013Hebei Region\u2014Green Financing Scale up Project. \n \n2.  The  project  will  scale  up  and  catalyze  domestic  financing  for  sustainable  air  quality \nimprovement  and  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions  reduction  by  supporting  clean  energy \ninvestments; diversifying national green bond instruments; and enhancing financial inclusion for \nmicro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and women. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Government of the PRC agreed in 2015 to \nestablish a multiyear lending program during 2015\u20132020 to mutually reinforce government actions \nfor reducing air pollution in the greater Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) region.1 Since 2015, under \nthe multiyear lending program, ADB has approved about $2 billion in loans that have been \nimplemented successfully. In 2015, ADB approved the first policy-based loan in the PRC under \nthe program, which focused on policy reforms and regulatory capacity strengthening to improve \nair quality in Hebei Province.2 In 2016, the second loan was approved to establish a green \nfinancing platform (GFP) for developing air pollution reduction projects in the region by enabling \nbetter access to finance.3 In 2017, the third loan was approved to support the adoption of high-\nlevel technologies by major polluting entities across key sectors in the region.4 In 2018, the fourth \nloan was approved to help Shandong Province adopt more efficient and advanced technologies \nfor heat production and refrigeration by replacing coal with cleaner energy sources such as \nnatural gas, renewable energy, and waste heat recovery.5 In 2019, the fifth loan was approved to \naccelerate a switch from coal to natural gas and biogas for residential, commercial, and industrial \nuses to improve air quality in Henan Province.6  The proposed project will be the sixth loan under \nthe air quality improvement  program.7  \n  \n \n1  The region includes Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; and Hebei, Henan, \nLiaoning, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces. \n2  ADB. 2015.

Manila. \n7  ADB is also supporting small and medium sized local banks and financial institutions in Hebei, Shandong and \nShaanxi provinces, including Bank of Xingtai, Shandong Green Development Fund, and Shaanxi Financial Holding \nGroup, to build local capacity and promote green finance.  \n ", "2 \n4.  ADB has extended financial assistance using various lending modalities to (i) strengthen \npolicies and regulatory frameworks, (ii) introduce new technologies, and (iii) support inclusive \nenergy delivery to improve air quality. During 2015\u20132017, the assistance focused on enhancing \npolicy and regulatory frameworks, and developing green financing platforms to raise domestic \nfunding for sustainable air quality improvement in the region. During 2018\u20132019, the assistance \ntargeted the  highly  polluted  provinces  in the region  to  support  technology  leapfrogging  and \ninclusive  service  delivery  of  clean  heating  and  fuel  supply.  The  combination  of  institutional \nbuilding and targeted approaches has been mutually reinforcing to effectively support air quality \nimprovement  in  a  geographically  dispersed  area.  The  policy-based  loan  approved  in  2015 \n(footnote 2) was rated highly successful.8 The other four loans are under implementation. The \nfollowing lessons have been learned from the multiyear lending program: (i) strong government \ncommitment to improve air quality is essential, (ii) the executing and implementing agencies \nrequire strong technical and management capacities for effective implementation, and (iii) the \nproject  design  needs  to  be  flexible  to  accommodate  evolving  government  policies  and \nregulations. ADB\u2019s Energy Sector Group carried out a midterm program evaluation in 2018 for the \nmultiyear  lending  program,  and  assessed  that  it  is  highly  relevant,  effective, \nefficient, and sustainable; the  evaluation  highlighted  the  following  experiences:  (i)  close \ncollaboration  across ongoing BTH projects and programs through joint workshops to share \nlessons and experiences, and (ii) flexible lending modalities and project designs  to adapt to \nevolving PRC policies.9 \n \n5.  Change  in  air  pollution  sources.  Government  actions  to  accelerate  air  pollution \nreduction  and  ADB\u2019s  multiyear  lending  support  have  resulted  in  significant  air  quality \nimprovement in the greater BTH region. The annual average concentration of particulate matter \nless  than  2.5  micrometers  in  diameter  (PM2.5)  in  the  region  decreased  by  27%,  from  60.3 \nmicrograms per cubic meter (\u03bcg/m3) in 2015 to 47.9 \u03bcg/m3 in 2019. However, this remains far \nabove  the  national  class  I  ambient  air  quality  standard  and  the  World  Health  Organization \nstandard (35.0 \u03bcg/m3), and the greater BTH region faces two challenges to improve air quality \nfurther: (i) the dominant source of PM  is shifting from primary emission sources (i.e., directly \n2.5\nemitted  pollutants  from  coal  combustion,  vehicle  exhaust,  biomass  burning,  and  industrial \nproduction  processes)  to  secondary  pollutants  that  are  formed  in  the  atmosphere  through \nchemical reactions of precursor pollutants and transported over long distances, and are estimated \nto contribute 44% of PM  pollution in the BTH region10 and (ii) concentration of ground-level \n2.5\nozone (O ), which is a gas formed from precursor pollutants and a major source of smog, \n3\nincreased by 18%, from 117.1 \u03bcg/m3 in 2015 to 142.2 \u03bcg/m3 in 2019.11 \n \n6.  Wide  area-based  approach  and  government  policy.  Addressing  an  increase  in \nsecondary  pollutants,  including  O ,  in  the  greater  BTH  region  requires  a  wider  area-based \n3\nintervention. The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, which comprises Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang \nprovinces, and Shanghai Municipality, is the PRC\u2019s second largest economic zone, accounting for \n22% of gross domestic product (GDP), and is the area with the second highest air pollution \n \n8  ADB. 2018.

O3 exposure impacts \nhuman health (lung function) and the growth of crops and trees. \n ", "3 \nconcentrations in the PRC.12 Air pollutant emissions in the country are highly concentrated in the \nnortheast corridor between Beijing and Shanghai, and air quality in the greater BTH and YRD \nregions is interlinked through air pollutants transported across the two adjacent regions. In June \n2018, the Government of the PRC issued the Three-Year Action Plan for Winning the Blue Sky \nWar, 2018\u20132020,13 which adds the YRD region as a priority area for wider-area based policy \nintervention beyond the greater BTH region. It intends to control O  as well as PM emissions by \n3 2.5 \naccelerating (i) closure of heavily polluting industries, (ii) reductions of surplus production capacity \nin industries, (iii) a shift to less air polluting transport modes, and (iv) construction of cleaner and \nless air polluting energy systems. The plan targets reducing emissions by 2020 (from 2015 levels) \nby more than 15% for nitrogen oxide and more than 10% for volatile organic compounds (both of \nwhich are precursors of O ), more than 15% for sulfur dioxide, and more than 18% for PM . \n3 2.5\n \n7.  Increasing  hydrofluorocarbon  emissions.  In  addition  to  air  pollution  targets,  the \ngovernment issued a nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement committing to \nreaching peak GHG emissions by 2030. GHG emissions growth in the country has been slowing \ndown,  with  annual  GHG  emissions  growth  during  2013\u20132018  reaching  a  plateau  of  0.4%. \nHowever, emissions of hydrofluorocarbon (HFC), which is one of the most potent GHGs, have \ngrown by about 20% annually in 2010\u20132019. The PRC is the largest HFC producer in the world, \naccounting for 70% of global production.14 In addition, HFC emission is highly concentrated in the \nnortheast corridor between Beijing and Shanghai because of the presence of an industrial cluster \nproducing HFC. In the business-as-usual scenario, HFC emission is projected to grow to about \n428  million  tons  of carbon  dioxide  (CO )  equivalent  by  2030 from  182  million  tons  of  CO  \n2 2\nequivalent in 2010. In 2016, the PRC adopted the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, \ncommitting to reach peak consumption and production of HFC by 2024, with an 80% reduction by \n2045. In 2019, the government started implementing the Green and High-Efficiency Cooling \nAction Plan to achieve its commitment to the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol.  \n \n8.  Challenges in sustainable financing for air quality improvement. Public spending on \nair  quality  improvement  reached  CNY744  billion  in  2019,  whereas  an  estimated  annual \ninvestment of CNY1,538 billion is required to meet the national class I air quality standard by \n2030. The domestic green bond market is one of the fundraising channels to narrow this funding \ngap. After the first green bond guideline was issued by the People\u2019s Bank of China in December \n2015, the PRC\u2019s green bond market expanded from CNY238 billion issued in 2016 to CNY386 \nbillion in 2019, making the PRC the world\u2019s largest source of green bond issuance.15 Despite \nbeing the world\u2019s largest market by size, the types of green bonds, in the view of issuers and \ntenors, are not well diversified. About 90% of green bonds in 2019 were corporate bonds. The \ntenor of green bonds is relatively short: about 60% of bonds issued have a maturity of less than 5 \nyears. Developing a range of instruments and tenors is essential to further develop the domestic \ngreen bond market to meet growing green financing demand. In addition, there remain gaps \nbetween  domestic  green  bond  regulations  and  international  standards  with  regard  to  green \nproject and asset definitions, tracking and management of proceeds, and external reviews and \nassurance; about 50% of PRC green bonds issued in 2019 were not aligned with international \n \n12 In the YRD region in 2019, the annual concentration of PM2.5 was 41\u03bcg/m3 and that of O3 was 164 \u03bcg/m3.  \n13 Government of the PRC. 2018.

These are produced synthetically and \nprimarily used as a refrigerant for cooling and refrigeration. HFCs were developed as alternatives to O3-depleting \nsubstances to be phased out under the Montreal Protocol. However, HFCs are potent GHGs with thousands of times \nthe global warming potential of CO2. \n15 Climate Bonds Initiative and China Central Depository & Clearing Research Centre. 2020.

Although the gap in standards has been narrowing since 2015, further alignment with \ninternational standards is desirable to gain stronger credibility and transparency in the market. \n \n9.  Challenges in financial inclusiveness for air quality improvement. MSMEs in the \nPRC account for about 60% of GDP and 80% of urban employment. Women have a higher \nrepresentation in MSMEs as managers and employees.16 Despite their substantial contribution to \nthe country\u2019s economy, MSMEs still face limited access to finance and high financing costs \nbecause of perceived credit risks and stringent collateral requirements by banks. MSMEs lending \naccounts for only 22% of total bank loans outstanding, and the risk premium of MSMEs is \nestimated to be 40% higher than that of large enterprises. Because of limited access to finance \nand delayed investment in pollution reduction, it is estimated that 70% of air and water pollution is \nattributed to MSMEs.17 \n \n10.  Increasing emissions post COVID-19. Air pollutant concentration and GHG emissions in \nthe first quarter (Q1) of 2020 dropped by about 30% compared with Q1 2019 because of the \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) lockdowns and associated energy consumption declines. With \nthe lifting of the COVID-19 related restrictions in most part of the PRC in late March 2020, year-\non-year emissions bounced back and overshot 2019 emissions by about 5% during April\u2013May \n2020 because of the rapid economic rebound.18 Uninterrupted clean energy investment in the \npost-pandemic scenario, in parallel with economic recovery, is essential to maintain emissions \nreduction momentum. \n \n11.  Proposed solution. The project aims to comprehensively address emerging challenges \nin air quality improvement and GHG emissions reduction in the greater BTH and YRD regions. It \nalso aims to stimulate post-COVID-19 recovery investment with build-back-better principles by \ncontinuously scaling up clean energy technologies and systems applications  in the targeted \nregions, which together account for about 53.4% of total GDP, 53.0% of total primary energy \nconsumption, and 45.9% of the total population in the PRC. Using lessons learned from the \nmultiyear lending program (para. 4), the project adopts a flexible lending modality with particular \nattention on mobilizing domestic funds and promoting financial inclusiveness for sustainable \nclean energy investment. It uses the financial intermediation loan modality, which is the best fit to \nsupport geographically scattered investments while maximizing ADB\u2019s loan leveraging capacity \nthrough revolving the loan funds and mobilizing domestic funds. The project expands the GFP \nthat  was  established  under  the  second  loan  (footnote  3)  for  sustainable  investments  in  air \npollutant and GHG emission reduction activities in the expanded regions.19 \n \n12.  The  GFP  is  directly  under  the  control  of  China  National  Investment  and  Guaranty \nCorporation (I&G), which is a state-owned financial institution specialized in credit enhancement \nto support investment for social and economic development. I&G has strengthened its corporate \ngovernance since  2015  including  professional management,  separation  of  management  and \noperations, mixed ownership, and private sector involvement in areas monopolized by the public \n \n16 Specific statistics are missing, as sex-disaggregated data are not collected on a regular basis. \n17 J.

The outputs are as follows: (i) GFP and leveraged commercial financing for pollution \nreduction projects established, (ii) barriers lowered and financing scaled up for small and medium-sized enterprises \nand energy service company from the GFP, and (iii) capacity in financial products and to appraise and implement \nGFPs strengthened. \n ", "5 \nsector. I&G has successfully promoted mixed ownership and private sector involvement, and 49% \nof the I&G stake is not owned by the PRC government, of which about 38% is owned by private \nfinancial institutions. The GFP is a first-of-its-kind mechanism dedicated to air pollution reduction \nin the greater BTH region, and it offers debt financing, credit guarantees, financial leasing, and \nequity investments. It has already supported 13 subprojects with a total investment of \u20ac1,043 \nmillion of which ADB has financed \u20ac332 million.20 \n \n13.  Alignment  with  Strategy  2030  and  country  partnership  strategy.  The  project  is \naligned  with  two  operational  priorities  of  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030:  the  project  will  support  (i) \noperational  priority  2  (accelerating  progress  in  achieving  gender  equality)  through  gender \nmainstreaming activities; and (ii) operational priority 3 (tackling climate change, building climate \nand disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability) by accelerating low GHG \nemissions development and ensuring environmental sustainability. The project will contribute to \nSustainable Development Goal 5 (achieve gender equality), Sustainable Development Goal 7 \n(ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all) and Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 13 (take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts). The project \nalso supports the PRC\u2019s nationally determined contribution targeting the following, to be achieved \nby around 2030: (i) peaking CO  emission, (ii) lowering CO  emission per unit GDP by 60%\u201365% \n2 2\nfrom 2005, and (iii) increasing non-fossil fuel usage to 20% of total energy share. The project is \nalso aligned with the priorities of broadening the response to climate change and strengthening \nenvironmental sustainability in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2016\u20132020.21 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n14.  The project is aligned with the following impact: air quality and public health in the greater \nBTH and YRD regions improved (footnote 13). The project will have the following outcome: air \npollutants and greenhouse gas emissions reduced.22 \n \n15.  Output 1: Green financing platform operations expanded. The GFP (para. 12) will \nscale up its operations by (i) expanding regional coverage to the YRD region to accelerate air \npollutant  and  GHG  emissions  reduction;  and  (ii)  focusing  on  cutting-edge  technologies  in \nrenewable energy, clean transport, industrial energy efficiency, and cooling system retrofits. Initial \nsubprojects identified include fast charging stations to support wider uptake of electric vehicles; \nhigh-quality  biogas  and  biomass  ethanol  production  plants  for  industrial,  commercial,  and \nresidential energy use;  high conversion efficiency and low degradation solar photovoltaic power \nplants; heat, ventilation, and air-conditioning system renovation for industrial energy efficiency; \nand a cooling system retrofit using water and ice, which will be the first ADB intervention in the \ncooling sector in the PRC for HFC reduction. As part of scaling up, the GFP will also support \nstrengthening women\u2019s leadership in the clean energy sector through networking and training for \nfemale managers and employees of the subborrowers.  \n \n16.  Output 2: Credit enhancement scheme developed. The project will establish a credit \nenhancement scheme in the GFP to diversify green bond instruments with longer maturity. These \ngreen bonds will provide a direct funding channel for domestic project sponsors for air quality \n \n20 \u20ac332 million in disbursements under the ADB loan comprises \u20ac43 million for guarantee loss reserve, \u20ac93 million for \nfinancial lease, and \u20ac196 million for subloans to subborrowers. \n21 ADB. 2016.

The credit enhancement scheme will extend guarantee and investment instruments \nto improve the creditworthiness of domestic developers to issue clean air bonds (CABs).23 The \nscheme  also  supports  the  issuers  in  (i)  capacity  development  for  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS) compliance; (ii) arrangement of credible independent review for \nassessing the bond framework and use of proceeds for green investments; (iii) bond issuance \narrangements, including the authority\u2019s approval, bond structuring, marketing, and pricing; and \n(iv) credible tracking and monitoring arrangement for use of proceeds and emission reduction. On \nsuccessful issuance with full subscription in the market, the CABs will be the first air quality \nimprovement-dedicated green bonds in the PRC. \n \n17.  Output  3:  Access  to  inclusive  finance  improved.  The  project  will  also  further \nstrengthen  the  GFP\u2019s  capacity  for  financial  inclusion  in  air  quality  improvement  and  GHG \nemissions  reduction.  To  improve  access  to  finance  by  MSMEs,  including  energy  service \ncorporations, and to meet the government\u2019s policy on strengthening financial services access for \nMSMEs,24 the project will introduce a fintech-powered online lending platform. This will enable \nsimplified loan application, customer-specific risk-based loan pricing by using real-time big data to \nobtain comprehensive information for each loan application for precise credit risk assessment, \nand credit risk monitoring and management. The project will also help mainstream gender into \nproject implementation by increasing female staffing in the GFP and supporting involvement of \nwomen in clean energy investment. \n \n18.  The project will help catalyze domestic funds for sustainable investment in air quality \nimprovement and GHG emissions reduction. It will offer subloans, financial leasing, and a credit \nenhancement scheme (para. 16) to leverage domestic funds totaling the equivalent of \u20ac424.02 \nmillion for the initial subprojects (Table 2). Repaid loan proceeds from the initial subprojects will \nreflow into the designated account to be further invested in subprojects in additional batches, with \nan estimated total investment of \u20ac1.1 billion. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n \n19.  ADB financing will add substantial value to expand and strengthen GFP capacity to fully \ncatalyze  domestic  funds  for  sustainable  investment  in  air  quality  improvement  and  GHG \nemissions reduction toward 2030, while addressing the emerging challenge of increasing O  \n3\nconcentrations and HFC emissions that impede control of air pollution and GHG emissions in the \nPRC, by (i) supporting cutting-edge energy technologies to stimulate transformational change in \nenergy use and supply; (ii) developing a credit enhancement scheme to support domestic clean \nenergy developers to mobilize finance from the domestic market through issuance of CABs that \nare aligned with international standards; and (iii) promoting financial inclusion through fintech-\npowered lending platform development for MSMEs, and gender mainstreaming in clean energy \ninvestments. The project is expected to deliver valuable lessons in scaling up investments for air \npollutants  and  GHG  emissions  reduction;  these  lessons  would  be  disseminated  through \nworkshops for other ADB developing member countries for replication in future projects. \n \n \n23 The clean air bond is air quality improvement-dedicated bond that aligns with domestic green bond regulations and \ninternational standards. (Climate Bonds Initiative. 2019. Climate Bonds Standard: Version 3.0.

The government has requested a loan of \u20ac127.01 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 15-year term including a grace period \nof 10 years to seek the rollover of ADB loan proceeds and larger impacts, an annuity repayment \nat the 10% discount rate option, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLondon interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per \nyear, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nBased on this, the average loan maturity is 12.95 years with no maturity premium payable. \n \n22.  The summary financing plan for the initial subprojects is in Table 2. ADB will finance (i) \ngoods, works, and services for qualified subprojects funded by subloans and financial lease; and \n(ii)  investment  and  guarantee  loss  reserves  to  support  CAB  issuance.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  I&G which established the GFP and is responsible for its operation, will be the project\u2019s \nexecuting  and  implementing  agency.  I&G  has  demonstrated  excellent  performance  in \nimplementing the earlier Air Quality Improvement GFP project (para. 11). The State Development \n ", "8 \n& Investment Corp., Ltd. (SDIC),25 the controlling entity of I&G, will be the oversight body of the \nproject. Bank of Beijing (BOB) will be the entrusted bank to assist I&G with debt financing \noperation under the project.26 \n \n24.  The ADB loan proceeds will be onlent from the Ministry of Finance to I&G through SDIC \non identical repayment, tenors, and pricing terms as ADB\u2019s loan. SDIC and I&G will bear the \nforeign exchange risk, and I&G will utilize the ADB loan amount through financing instruments \ndescribed  in  Table  1.  I&G\u2019s  due  diligence  will  consider  technical  merit,  credit  quality,  and \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  based  on  the  subproject  selection  criteria. 27  The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the project \nadministration manual (PAM).28 \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2021\u2013March 2026 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2026 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 September 2026 \nManagement \n(i) Oversight body  State Development & Investment Corp., Ltd. \n(ii) Executing agency  China National Investment and Guaranty Corporation  \n(iii) Key implementing agency  China National Investment and Guaranty Corporation \n(iv) Implementing unit  Green financing platform with 30 full-time professional staff \nProcurement   I&G shall ensure that (i) subborrowers of the ADB loan use appropriate procurement \nmethods that ensure value for money on the basis of acceptable private sector or \ncommercial practices acceptable to ADB and (ii) utilization of proceeds of such loan \nshall be subject to the eligibility criteria and the integrity requirements set out in the \nProcurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). \nRetroactive financing  Retroactive financing will be provided to subprojects approved by ADB for expenses \nincurred by the subborrowers not more than 12 months prior to the date of the loan \nagreement. The subprojects must meet the same subproject eligibility criteria set out \nin the project administration manual. The total amount of retroactive financing will \nnot exceed 20% of the loan amount.  \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2017, as amended from time to time), and detailed arrangements agreed between \nthe government and ADB and described in the project administration manual. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, I&G = China National Investment and Guaranty Corporation. \nSources: I&G and ADB. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n25.  Initial subprojects. Technical due diligence was carried out for initial subprojects. These \nmultisector subprojects, which aim to accelerate emissions reduction across multiple sectors in \nthe  greater  BTH  and  YRD  regions,  include  a  fast  electric  vehicle  charging  station  with  an \nintelligent management system, high-quality biogas and biomass ethanol production, a solar \n \n25 SDIC is a state-owned financial institution controlled by the state-owned asset supervision and administration \ncommission under the State Council. It is also a majority shareholder of I&G. \n26 BOB is a commercial bank headquartered in Beijing with about 600 branches nationwide. BOB, acting as the agent \nof I&G, has been the entrusted bank for the Air Quality Improvement in the I&G\u2019s GFP project (footnote 3) since \n2016, administering the debt operation according to the terms and rate agreed with I&G.  \n27 The subproject selection criteria are in Appendix 3 of the Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n ", "9 \nphotovoltaic system with high conversion efficiency and low degradation, heat, ventilation, and \nair-conditioning system renovation for industrial energy efficiency, and a cooling system retrofit \nusing  water  and  ice  with  storage.  These  subprojects  are  deemed  technically  feasible  and \nappropriate to achieve the intended energy savings and emissions reduction. \n \n26.  Fintech. I&G is deemed to have sufficient capacity and experience to design the fintech \napplication. In 2015, it established Zhejiang Online Financial Asset Trading Center Co. Ltd., \nwhich adopted a fintech-based online financial platform, using myriad information from real-time \nbig data, to facilitate business-to-business transactions. Based on the experience gained, the \nproject will expand the fintech application for MSMEs financing in clean energy to develop a \nflexible  but  robust  platform  for  credit  application,  appraisal,  and  monitoring.  The  fintech \napplication action plan, which comprises two stages (an interim and final assessment), for large \nscale adoption is detailed in Appendix 4 of the PAM (footnote 28). \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n27.  Financial analysis of the project indicates an average financial internal rate of return of \n11.09%, with a range of 6.35%\u201313.41% for the seven initial subprojects, all higher than the \naverage weighted average cost of capital of 3.05% and corresponding weighted average cost of \ncapital  of  each  subproject.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  all  subprojects  are  likely  to  be \nsustainable under various adverse scenarios. The economic internal rate of return of the project \nranges from 12.69% to 35.72% for the seven initial subprojects, all above the 9.00% economic \nopportunity cost of capital. Sensitivity analysis shows that the project is likely to be sustainable \nwith economic rates of return above 9.00% under various adverse scenarios.29 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n28.  Sustainability of the project relies upon the government\u2019s policy and the selection of \nquality  investments.  Commitments  to  air  pollution  and  GHG  emissions  reduction  are  in  the \nThirteenth Five-Year Plan, 2016\u2013202030 and nationally determined contributions of the PRC. \nAppendix 3 of the PAM (footnote 28) defines applicable subproject selection criteria in technical, \nfinancial, and economic viabilities; the project owner\u2019s creditworthiness; and environmental and \nsocial  safeguard  requirements,  these  criteria  guide  screening  and  appraisal  of  individual \ntransactions.  It  also  excludes  fossil  fuel  fired  power  and  heat  generation  capacity  addition, \nregardless of energy saving benefit. The project will also support domestic green bond market \ndevelopment by the credit enhancement scheme (output 2) to diversify and grow a funding \nchannel for sustainable clean investment. As the financial intermediary, I&G has demonstrated \nsatisfactory ratings on the criteria of capital, asset quality, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to \nmarket risk. I&G\u2019s liquidity position became relatively weaker from 2015 to 2019 because of \nincreased leverage, and its long-term financial sustainability may suffer if the trend continues. \nHowever, its overall liquidity position was still strong in 2019, with a cash and financial asset\u2013debt \nratio of 1.43. Projected financial statements of I&G from 2020\u20132035 consolidating the incremental \nimpact of the project illustrate that the financial sustainability of I&G will improve. \n \n \n \n \n \n29 Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n30 Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China. 2016.

The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  following  ADB\u2019s  technical \nguidance  notes  for  (i)  financial  due  diligence  for  financial  intermediaries  and  (ii)  financial \nmanagement assessment. The results for SDIC, I&G, and BOB show that adequate financial \nmanagement systems and procedures are in place to meet ADB requirements. The external audit \nreports from 2016\u20132019 for SDIC, I&G, and BOB had unqualified opinions. I&G and BOB fully \ncomplied  with  the  regulator\u2019s  prudential  regulations  during  2016-2019.  The  assessed  pre-\nmitigation financial management risk is moderate. \n \n30.  Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time) (as \napplicable to financial intermediation loans), and appropriate procedures will be adopted. The \nprocurement assessment was conducted on the initial potential subprojects. It showed that most \nof the subborrowers\u2019 procurement practices follow established domestic commercial practices, \nand procurement procedures are aligned with the PRC\u2019s procurement laws and are acceptable to \nADB. To provide guidance on this, a project-specific procurement manual has been prepared and \nincluded in Appendix 8 of the PAM (footnote 28). \n \n31.  Integrity  due  diligence  was  conducted.31 No  significant  integrity  risks  were  identified.  \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment  and  I&G.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 28). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n32.  Social benefit. Improved air quality will directly benefit about 614 million people, including \n10.4 million poor people in the greater BTH region and 3.8 million poor people in the YRD region \nwho receive the minimum living guarantee subsidy.32 Initial subprojects are estimated to generate \n1,570 job opportunities during construction and 1,048 job opportunities during operation. I&G will \npromote  compliance  with  the  relevant  labor  laws  and  occupational  health  standards  by  all \nsubborrowers. Subprojects resulting in labor retrenchment and redundancies because of the \nintroduction of new technologies will not be financed. \n \n33.  Gender.  The  project  is  categorized  effective  gender  mainstreaming  following  ADB\u2019s \nguidelines.33 A gender assessment was conducted indicating that despite progress, women in the \nrenewable  energy  sector  remain  underrepresented  and  face  barriers  such  as  (i)  gender \nstereotypes  that  influence  hiring  practices  and  individual  professional  choices,  (ii)  lack  of \nawareness  and  information  about  job  opportunities  in  the  sector,  and  (iii)  limited  access to \nprofessional networks. In addition, the lack of sex-disaggregated data in the renewable energy \nsector limits the capacity to formulate targeted gender equality policies, including for financing \nfemale entrepreneurs. Initiatives to support women in the sector in the PRC include networks and \ncampaigns.34 This is the first time that I&G will be implementing gender equality actions, and its \n \n31 ADB. 2003.

A gender action plan35 has been prepared that \nincludes  actions  and  targets  to  (i)  increase  transactions  that  support  female  entrepreneurs \nseeking  clean  energy  investment;  (ii)  support  participating  subprojects  to  tackle  gender \nstereotypes of women in renewable energy by supporting networking opportunities for female \nleaders of MSMEs and energy service corporations, and training events for female employees \nand  managers;  (iii)  mainstream  gender  in  the  operation  of  the  GFP  by  increasing  female \ninvestment managers in the GFP; and (iv) support the collection of sex-disaggregated data from \nborrowers. Gender indicators are included in the design and monitoring framework, and the \nbudget has been confirmed for the implementation of the gender action plan. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n34.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are FI for environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples.36 An ESMS \nwas developed based on the experience and lessons learned from the Air Quality Improvement \nGFP project (footnote 3) to provide guidance on (i) screening, categorization, and review of \nsubprojects; (ii) capacity building; (iii) grievance redress; and (iv) monitoring and reporting. I&G \nwill use the ADB program management office with an ESMS unit of four regular staff to conduct \nenvironmental and social safeguards due diligence of the proposed subprojects. A series of \ncapacity building and trainings on ADB safeguard policy requirements was provided to I&G staff \nduring  the  implementation  of  the  GFP  project.  All  13  of  the  subprojects  approved  to  date, \nincluding one subproject categorized A for environment, have met all the requirements in the \nESMS,  including  screening  and  categorization,  due  diligence,  compliance  monitoring  and \nreporting,  grievance  redress  mechanism,  information  disclosure,  public  consultation,  and \nenvironmental and social audit of existing and associated facilities. I&G has sufficient capacity to \nimplement the project from an environmental and social safeguards perspective. In addition, I&G \nhas signed long-term contracts with national consultants to support the ESMS implementation. \n \n35.  The ESMS provides for the inclusion of environment category A subprojects. If any such \nsubprojects are implemented, ADB will review and clear the environmental impact assessments, \nwhich will be posted on ADB\u2019s website 120 days prior to approval of the subprojects. Each \nsubproject will undergo due diligence following national regulations, ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement,  and  the  requirements  in  the  ESMS.  Climate  risk  assessments  for  the  proposed \nsubprojects will be conducted, and the findings will be incorporated in the subproject design. For \nsocial  safeguards,  any  subproject  that  triggers  involuntary  resettlement  impacts  or  adverse \nimpacts on ethnic minorities will be excluded from financing. Subprojects that result in positive \nimpacts on ethnic minorities (such as subprojects involving enterprises owned and/or managed \nby ethnic minorities that aim to improve these enterprises' competitiveness and support their \ncontributions to air quality outcomes) will be eligible for financing.37 I&G will be required to submit \nannual  ESMS  implementation  reports  and  consolidated  environmental  and  social  monitoring \nreports during project implementation. \n \n \ncommitment by organizations to work toward equal pay, equal leadership, and equal opportunities for women in the \nclean energy sector by 2030.
