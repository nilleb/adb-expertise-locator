During the 2004 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of Bangladesh confirmed its request for assistance to prepare the Secondary \nTowns Water Supply and Sanitation Project. The Government and ADB agreed that technical \nassistance (TA) will be provided in 2004 and a proposed loan in 2006. The TA Fact-Finding \nMission  visited  Bangladesh  from  10\u201325  October  2004  and  held  discussions  with  the \nGovernment  and  other  concerned  agencies.  The  Mission  visited  six  towns1  (Chandpur, \nChuadanga, Comilla, Gazipur, Jessore, and Mymensingh) and met with the Department of \nPublic Health Engineering (DPHE), local representatives, and the pourashava (municipality) \nchairpersons  and  staff  to  discuss  the  water  supply  and  sanitation  situation.  The  Mission \npresented its findings at a wrap-up meeting on 25 October 2004. The Government concurs with \nthe TA goals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, \nand terms of reference of the consultants.2 A preliminary project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Bangladesh has a population of about 130 million, with approximately 25% living in \nurban  areas.  Compared  with  the  overall  annual  national  growth  rate  of  1.4%,  the  urban \npopulation is growing at 2.5% per annum. Due to urbanization, towns are expanding rapidly \nboth spatially and in population. An analysis of piped water supply services to towns with \npopulation of 50,000\u2013400,000 shows that less than 20% of the town residents have piped water \nsupply  to  their  houses.  Some  have  access  to  water  at  a  distance  from  their  homes  via \nstandposts, but most rely on shallow tubewells with hand pumps. ADB has supported projects \naddressing  water  supply  and  sanitation  in  secondary  towns:  District  Towns  Water  Supply \nProject  (targeting  five  towns)  approved  in  1982  and  Second  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation \nProject (nine towns) approved in 1993.3 DPHE, the executing agency for both projects, has \noverall responsibility for water supply and sanitation (except for Dhaka and Chittagong).  \n \n3.  Ongoing and planned external assistance to urban water supply include (i) the Danish \nInternational Development Assistance (Danida) Sector Support Program, assisting six small \ntowns;  (ii)  a  potential  Danida-Swedish  International  Development  Cooperation  Agency \nintervention  to  develop  sources  for  Dhaka\u2019s  water  supply;  and  (iii)  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency assistance to develop a central water-testing laboratory. Danida has also \nbeen helping DPHE\u2019s Unit of Policy Implementation promote policy and institutional reforms in \nthe water supply sector. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Lack of Adequate Water Supply. In most towns, the piped water supply is dependent \non deep tubewells. Due to high electricity cost, these pumps run only for 10\u201312 hours per day \nand water availability to consumers is for 2\u20134 hours per day. About 5% of the population \nreceives water from standposts and 15% from public tubewells through piped connections. The \nremaining 60% rely on shallow wells. Apart from inconvenience and access to limited quantities \nof water, supplies from shallow wells are subject to arsenic and bacteriological contamination, \nand in the dry season the water levels often fall below that accessible to suction pumps. Many \n                                                 \n1  The towns were chosen by DPHE on the basis of its preliminary needs assessment.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 20 January 2004. \n3  The District Towns Water Supply Project was rated partly satisfactory in its project performance audit report (ADB. \n1995. Project Performance Audit Report on the District Towns Water Supply Project in Bangladesh. Manila [Loan \n571-BAN(SF)]) and the Second Water Supply and Sanitation Project was rated successful in its project completion \nreport (ADB. 2004. Project Completion Report on the Second Water Supply and Sanitation Project in Bangladesh. \nManila [Loan 1264-BAN(SF)].  \n ", "2  \nschools don\u2019t have access to piped water. Additional sources for water supply, rehabilitation of \nexisting systems, and expansion of new systems in new areas are all required.  \n \n5.  Poor  Water  Quality.  Arsenic  problems  are  not  often  associated  with  the  official \npourashava water supply, but do affect the shallow well supplies for people not connected to \npiped water. Due to surface contamination from animals and open defecation of humans, health \nrisks are high. High iron and manganese concentrations in the water are common with deep \nwell supplies, which draw water from aquifers of about 150 meters deep. Where good quality \nsurface water exists, this, if utilized, may become an alternative to tubewell supply after required \ntreatment.  DPHE  recognizes  that  the  lack  of  adequate  water  testing  facilities  is  a  major \nconstraint,  and  the  Government  is  considering  assistance  from  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency. \n \n6.  Lack of Sanitation. Septic tanks and pit latrines serve most of the households in formal \nsettlements, but desludging is not organized. Most towns have slums accommodating from 5\u2013\n40% of the population; pourashavas are responsible for their water supply. Good, clean, and \nhygienic community sanitation facilities, including toilets, drains, and footpaths are needed. Lack \nof  good  sanitation  facilities  in  schools  deters  female  education.  None  of  the  towns  have \nsewerage. Recognizing the need to do more for sanitation, in 2003 the Government organized a \nnationwide detailed survey of urban sanitation, and set a target of 100% sanitation in the \ncountry by 2010. Each year in October a national sanitation campaign is organized. The TA will \nsupport the Government in achieving these targets through sound community-based techniques \nand introducing community awareness programs using lessons learned on earlier projects. \n \n7.  Financial Sustainability. On average, pourashavas\u2019 revenues from water tariffs cover \nonly about 64% of operation and maintenance expenses. In fact, only 3 of 28 large pourashavas \n(50,000 to 400,000 population) meet operation and maintenance costs from their own revenues. \nMonthly household water bills (flat rate only) vary from about Tk50 to TK200, with an average of \nabout Tk70. If the poverty line is set at Tk5,000 per month, this average equates to just 1.4% of \nthat  income.  But  collection  efficiency  varies  from  60\u201385%.  Supplies  are  not  metered.  The \nportion of the property holding tax (12.5%) for water tax does not materialize as cash in the \npourashava water supply and sanitation unit accounts. Also accounts are in arrears, both in \nwater  billing  and  in  payment  of  electricity  charges.  There  is  a  need  to  (i)  conduct  a \ncomprehensive analysis of the existing tariffs and estimate the appropriate water tariffs to cover \nlong-term average costs; and (ii) bring all the illegal and unregistered consumers into a legalized \ndatabase to help improve revenues; and build the financial management capacity in billing, \ncollection, accounting, and budgeting. Based on lessons leaned on earlier projects, the financial \nand managerial powers of pourashavas need to be expanded to cover outstanding dues from \ngovernment agencies, without political interference. \n \n8.  Institutional  Weaknesses.  In  the  past,  the  pourashavas  lacked  staff\u2014approved \npositions were not fully filled. This no longer seems to be a problem. However, if pourashavas \ndouble their customer base in terms of water connections, staff needs must be reassessed, \nconsidering  employee-connection  ratio  and  looking  at  the  eventual  delegation  of  service \nprovision to accountable and autonomous pourashavas to ensure postproject sustainability. \nPourashava staff require training. Many do not have access to computers. Although supported \nby past ADB projects, DPHE has capacity-building needs. For 20 years no new core staff have \nbeen recruited, making it a top-heavy organization. A total reassessment of DPHE from an \norganization development perspective is required. A national training center for water supply \nand sanitation and an information center are being sought. The absence of any regulatory body \nhas contributed to the overall institutional weaknesses at the national and pourashava levels.  ", "  3\n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The Project\u2019s purpose is to improve living conditions and quality of life, and reduce \npoverty among people living in urban areas of Bangladesh, where water quality and access are \nserious issues and sanitation conditions are hazardous. The Project will help pourashavas in \nselected  secondary  towns  develop  effective  and  sustainable  management  of  water  and \nsanitation services. The TA will prepare a project suitable for ADB financing. The Project will \nfacilitate sustainable piped water supply services and safe sanitation in selected project towns. \nThe  TA  will  prepare  recommendations  for  institutional  capacity  building  of  the  target \npourashavas and DPHE by critically reviewing the pourashavas\u2019 performance and impact, and \nlessons learned from earlier projects. The TA will provide the overall project design, scope, cost, \nfinancing plan, and implementation arrangements; and will formulate the terms of reference for \nconsultants to be recruited to help implement the Project. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The Project will be prepared as a sector project. This is to facilitate competition among \nthe many pourashavas for loan funds based on (i) expressed needs, (ii) staff capability, and (iii) \nfinancial management. Four pourashavas,4 with populations ranging from 50,000 to 400,000, \ndifferent water resource situations (e.g., surface and groundwater supplies), different water \nquality  issues,  different  slum  situations,  different  financial  status,  different  rehabilitation \nrequirements, and low piped service coverage, will be selected for detailed study and analysis. \nThe TA will include a comprehensive water supply audit in accordance with standard ADB terms \nof  reference  in  the  four  pourashavas.  This  will  examine  all  water  sources  for  all  people \nconsidering quantity, quality, cost, and accessibility. The results will be analyzed and discussed \nat  a  stakeholder  consultation.  Priority  project  interventions  and  policy  will  be  determined. \nSelection and eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Project will be carefully prepared and agreed \nwith the Government during the TA.5 However certain minimum requirements related to the \nwater supply unit of pourashavas must be met: (i) full complement of adequate staff in place, (ii) \nno electricity payment arrears, and (iii) collections exceed operation and maintenance costs. \nThe TA will carefully assess the reasons for noncompliance with the minimum requirements by \nneedy  pourashavas,  and  evaluate  their  potential  to  fulfill  minimum  requirements  based  on \nidentified performance indicators. This will provide an opportunity for the needy pourashavas to \nqualify for investment under the Project. Under the eligibility criteria, the TA will prioritize urban \n(and  peri-urban)  areas  where  shallow  aquifers  are  highly  contaminated  with  arsenic,6  and \npeople without piped water supply are affected. For towns included in the ongoing Urban \nGovernance and Infrastructure Improvement Project,7 effective performance under that project \nwill be used as a criterion for selection in the proposed Project. In addition, the baseline data on \nhealth standards relating to waterborne diseases will be used in the eligibility criteria. Based on \n                                                 \n4  Tentatively Brahmanbaria, Chandpur, Comilla, and Jessore are proposed.  \n5  Towns included for implementation of water supply and sanitation improvements under this project may have been \nincluded  in  previous  ADB-assisted  integrated  urban  development  or  flood  protection  projects  but  such \ncircumstances will be justified based on the water supply and sanitation needs. \n6  The TA will ensure that the arsenic mitigation interventions under the Project are coordinated with other externally \nfunded efforts in this field (Japan International Cooperation Agency, Department for International Development, \nUnited Kingdom, United Nations Children\u2019s Fund, World Bank). \n7  ADB. 2002.

Manila [Loan 1947-BAN(SF), for $87 million]. \n ", "4  \noverall  eligibility  criteria,  final  selection  of  the  pourashavas  will  be  made  during  project \nimplementation. Approximately 10\u201312 secondary towns will be selected.  \n \n11.  The TA will prepare terms of reference for consultants to undertake comprehensive \norganization development of each project pourashava and DPHE. These will consider staff and \ntheir qualifications and skills, as well as procedures, accountability, incentives to perform, and \ntraining on technical operations and financial governance and management. \n \n12.  Project  interventions  will  give  priority  to  low-income  communities  and  schools.  The \nProject will be prepared using community participation, including women\u2019s groups; and be \nimplemented,  wherever  feasible  and  appropriate,  by  nongovernment  and  community-based \norganizations. In each subject pourashava, through stakeholder workshops, the TA will help \nformulate specific water supply and sanitation policy and create a civil society task force to \nmonitor policy and project implementation. The summary initial poverty and social analysis is in \nAppendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent, comprising $480,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $520,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  (Appendix  3).  ADB  will \nfinance the entire foreign exchange cost and $320,000 equivalent of the local currency cost, \ntotaling $800,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special \nFund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide $200,000 equivalent to \ncover the remuneration of counterpart staff, provision of office accommodation and facilities, \nand local transportation for counterpart staff. The Government has been informed that approval \nof the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  DPHE will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Local Government Division (under \nwhich DPHE operates) will coordinate with other Government agencies and directly with the \nconcerned pourashavas. The joint secretary, Local Government Division (water supply and \nsanitation),  will  head  a  steering  committee  that  will  meet  once  a  month  during  TA \nimplementation.  Committee  members  will  include  the  pourashava  chairpersons  of  the  four \npourashavas;  deputy  chief  (planning),  Local  Government  Division;  superintending  engineer \n(Planning  Circle),  DPHE;  joint  secretary,  Economic  Relations  Division;  director,  Urban \nManagement Support Unit, Local Government Engineering Department; representatives from \nFinance  Division,  Planning  Commission;  and  Implementation,  Monitoring  and  Evaluation \nDivision, Planning Commission; as well as a nominated Government representative on social, \ngender, and poverty issues. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months from April to October 2005. Consulting \nservices total 60 person-months: 20 international and 40 domestic. With the exception of the \ninternational and domestic water audit/policy advisers, an international firm will be engaged to \norganize the TA activities. International experts (with person-months in parenthesis) to be \nprovided by the firm will include a water supply engineer and team leader (7), financial analyst-\nfinancial management specialist (2), economist (2), environment specialist (2), organization \ndevelopment specialist (1.5), social and gender specialist (1), hydrogeologist (1), sanitation and \nsewage treatment specialist (1), and resettlement specialist (1). The team leader will be fielded \nbefore mobilizing the main group of consultants, to set up the TA implementation office, with ", "  5\n \nDPHE support. The team leader will help the ADB task manager identify and engage \ndomestic  individual  consultants  with  expertise  in  water  supply,  financial  management, \neconomic  analysis,  organization  development,  hydrogeology,  sociology  and  gender \ndevelopment,  water  and  sewage  treatment,  environment,  and  resettlement.  The  team \nleader will appoint an individual domestic deputy team leader within 4 weeks after the team \nleader\u2019s arrival in Bangladesh. ADB will engage the international firm and international and \ndomestic individual consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. A simplified \ntechnical proposal with the quality and cost-based selection method will be used to select \nthe  international  firm.  The  international  firm  will  contract  reputed  nongovernment \norganizations to conduct an awareness raising, hygiene education, social mobilization, and \nbaseline  survey.  The  consultants  may  procure  equipment  through  direct  purchase  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Upon TA completion, ownership of the \nequipment procured under TA will be transferred to DPHE. The outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n16.  The  consultants\u2019  reporting  requirements  include  (i)  an  inception  report  within  4 \nweeks of TA commencement (including the review of lessons learned and the work plan), \n(ii) an interim report within 12 weeks of TA commencement (including field visit reports, \nindicative investment program for the selected towns, and project framework), (iii) a draft \nfinal report within 20 weeks (including a full feasibility study), and (iv) a final report within 24 \nweeks  of  TA  commencement  incorporating  comments  on  the  draft  final  report  from  the \nGovernment and ADB. Stakeholder workshops will be held in each of the four pourashavas \n(following the water and sanitation audit) and one in Dhaka to discuss the draft final report \nattended by the pourashava chairpersons who wish to make a case for inclusion of their \npourashava  in  the  Project,  and  by  representatives  of  other  government  agencies, \nnongovernment organizations, other funding agencies, and interested consultants. Tripartite \nmeetings involving the Government, ADB, and the consultants will be held after the submission \nof inception, interim, and draft final reports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Bangladesh  for  preparing  the  Secondary  Towns  Water  Supply  and \nSanitation Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nPRELIMINARY PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal          \n\u2022 Percentage of the  Annual report of economic \nIncrease household \npopulation in absolute  survey, the Government \nincome and improve \npoverty reduced to 50%   \nhealth, particularly of poor \nby 2015  Annual Bangladesh resident \ncommunities, in the \nproject areas.  \u2022 Per household monthly  mission report on Bangladesh \nmedical expenditures  economic update \n \nreduced from the \n  average Tk500 per \nmonth to Tk350 per \nmonth \nPurpose  \u2022 Improved access to  Annual report of economic  Assumption (A): Competent \n  economic and social  survey, Government  Government staff continue to be \nImprove living conditions  services    available for management, \nin the selected secondary  \u2022 Maternal deaths in  Hospital reports  design, and supervision \ntowns (100,000\u2013400,000  project districts reduced     \npopulation) by improving  by 75% and infant  Health management  (A): Competent contractors are \nwater quality and access,  mortality rate reduced  information system   available, and competitive \nand ensuring adequate  by 65% by 2015    bidding of contracts is carried \ndisposal and treatment of  \u2022 Safe and reliable  ADB Review missions reports  out \nsewage.   drinking water provided     \n  for at least 1.2 million  Project completion report  (A): Government funding is \n  people, and water    available in accordance with \n  supply coverage  Project performance  loan disbursement schedule \nimproved from the  monitoring system reports    \nexisting x% to y% by the    Risk (R): Political environment \nend of 2010  Financial records and  may destabilize and delay \n\u2022 Drinking water and  management information  implementation of the Project \nsanitation facilities in all  system of the pourashava   \nschools in selected  (R): Major flood occurs in target \ntowns ensured   towns and stops implementation \n\u2022 Sanitation coverage \nimproved from the \nexisting x% to y% by \nend of 2010 \n\u2022 Pourashava water \nsupply and sanitation \nrunning cost of water \nand sanitation services \nsustainable with \ncollected water tariff \nmeeting operation and \nmaintenance costs \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  7 \nINITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS  \n \nA.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nIn Bangladesh, an overwhelmingly rural, steady migration from the rural to urban areas in search of employment and \neconomic opportunities is inflating the urban population. The urban areas are very densely populated, and shanty \nsettlements are sprouting in low-lying areas and on vacant land accommodating the extremely poor. With about 50% of \nthe country\u2019s population living below the poverty line, economic development and poverty reduction remain the \noverriding development priority in Bangladesh. Urban poverty declined from 34% in 1991/92 to 26% in 2000 according \nto the Household Income and Expenditure Survey 2000. Since about 25% of the population live in urban areas, the \nmajority of the population is poor, both income and human poverty need to be addressed. The urban development \nsubsector is important in reducing the vulnerability of the poor, as well as in providing a safer living environment with \nbasic facilities. Secondary towns provide for residence to both temporary and permanent migrants from the rural areas \nbecause of the proximity to their native villages. In most of the towns, water supply and sanitation facilities are limited. \nParticularly in poor areas and slums (accounting for 5% to 40% of the towns\u2019 population) living condition are unsafe and \nresidents are vulnerable to diseases and morbidity. According to Household Income and Expenditure Survey only \n32.06% of the population has access to supply water, 66.93% are dependent on tubewell water with the risk of arsenic \ncontamination. The same survey found that 55.29% of the urban population had unsafe sanitary latrines causing \ndamage to health and the environment. The 2004 flood adversely affected both water and sanitation. Urban water \nsupply systems were contaminated by flood water leaking into pipelines. Tubewells were drowned or infected, and \nlatrines  were  damaged  or  washed  out  deteriorating  the  overall  situation.  Development  of  water  and  sanitation \ninfrastructure in urban areas contributes to poverty reduction by reducing health risks and creating employment.  \n \nThe National Strategy for Economic Growth, Poverty Reduction, and Social Development announced five strategies: (i) \npro-poor economic growth for increasing income and employment of the poor; (ii) human development of the poor to \nraise their capability through education, health, nutrition, and social intervention; (iii) women\u2019s advancement and closing \ngender gaps in development; (iv) social safety nets for the poor; and (v) participatory governance, enhancement of the \nvoice of the poor, and improvement of nonmaterial dimensions of well-being, including security, power, and social \ninclusion by improving the performance of antipoverty institutions and removing institutional hurdles to social mobility.  \nImproved  safe  water  supply  and  sanitation  services  have  been  emphasized  to  reduce  health  costs,  decrease \nmalnutrition, and increase labor productivity. Effective measures to address arsenicosis from arsenic contamination of \ndrinking water from tubewells, to which the poor are more vulnerable within the framework of National Water Supply and \nSanitation Policy 1998 will be undertaken. To maximize direct and indirect multipliers of development for poverty \nreduction, the Government\u2019s priority is in area-based interventions in secondary towns. The water and sanitation \nprograms need to focus on provision of basic services as well as participation of private and public sectors in \ncollaboration with strengthened local government institutions, such as municipalities, so that the strengthened local \ngovernment institutions can support the poor to demand and access services.  \n \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) is planning to support the Government\u2019s efforts to address these issues. ADB has \nalready supported six development projects for secondary towns in Bangladesh since the 1980s. The proposed Project \nis expected to significantly contribute to reducing urban poverty and consolidate the gains made so far in the area. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nPoverty Analysis: The most direct economic measure of poverty is based on income or expenditure. Such data are \ncommonly collected through sample surveys, such as the household income and expenditure surveys. Survey data will \nbe required to estimate access of various groups to water and sanitation facilities, modes of delivery, level of arsenic \ncontamination, time for women and children to collect water, estimated cost of various modes by area, affordability of \npoorer groups, and direct and indirect poverty impact of the various services. Limited-size survey data can be combined \nwith available more comprehensive data sets.  \n \nTo improve poverty reduction impacts, equity of project effects will be considered to assess the distribution of economic \nand financial benefits and costs, and net benefits between poor groups and other stakeholders through distribution \nanalysis. During the feasibility study, the channels of effect need to be identified: (i) to see how costs will be incurred and \nbenefits realized; (ii) to identify gains from distributing project effects; (iii) to determine how much cost burden can be \nacceptable to those who will pay; (iv) to identify overall project performance and returns on equity consideration; and (v) \nto identify modifications of project design and components to enhance impact on target beneficiaries. \n \nContinued on next page\n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nC.
