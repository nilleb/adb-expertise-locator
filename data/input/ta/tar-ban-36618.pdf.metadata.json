The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has included in its Country Strategy and Program \nfor 2003 a loan for primary education in Bangladesh. The proposed ADB loan, together with \nsupport from other development partners, will assist the Government in meeting its long-term \ngoal of providing universal, quality primary education. At the Government\u2019s request, ADB is \ncurrently assisting the Primary and Mass Education Division (PMED) to prepare the next 5-year \nPrimary Education Development Program (PEDP II). A joint planning process for PEDP II is \nunder way. ADB is providing project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA)1 for planning the \nPEDP II and for preparing the ADB loan. Department for International Development, Norwegian \nAgency for International Cooperation, United Nations Children's Fund, European Union, and the \nWorld Bank are providing additional technical assistance for the joint process, coordinated by \nthe ADB PPTA. The development partners have been working with the Government and ADB to \narrive at a jointly designed and agreed upon PEDP II for primary education for 2003-2008, \nconsisting  of  a  policy  framework,  strategies,  program,  and  an  investment  plan,  including \nsubsector  performance  indicators,  priorities  for  investments,  and  capacity  building.  The \nGovernment has requested ADB to continue providing TA after the PPTA period, to strengthen \nthe Government\u2019s capacity to undertake the necessary operational planning for and begin \nimplementing  PEDP  II  on  schedule.  Fact-finding  was  undertaken  in  October  2002,  and \nunderstanding was reached with PMED on the objectives, scope, outputs, and outline terms of \nreference for the consultants. The TA received concept clearance from the Management on 8 \nNovember 2002.  The TA has not appeared in ADBBO. Upon approval, approval to waive \nADBBO listing will also be requested. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  In the last decade ADB assistance to primary education in Bangladesh, complemented \nby support from other multilateral and bilateral agencies, has focused increasingly on improving \naccess. As a result, the enrollment rates have improved steadily. In 2000, the gross enrollment \nand net enrollment rates for primary education were 97% and 81%, respectively. However, the \npoor quality of primary education is a major constraint to economic growth and to improving \nsocial  indicators.  Therefore,  under  the  umbrella  of  the  current  5-year  primary  education \ndevelopment  program  (PEDP  I),  external  assistance  from  ADB2  and  other  sources  has \nincreasingly emphasized improving quality and efficiency in addition to access, especially in the \nareas of curriculum, textbooks, teacher training and supervision, student assessment, and \nmanagement and planning.  \n \n3.  With support from external assistance, some progress has been made in monitoring \nsystem and classroom performance, and decentralizing the education management information \nsystem (EMIS). In addition, much progress has been made in staff training at all levels\u2014\nteachers, administrators, and planners. However, other factors undermine the impact of this \ntraining effort: absence of performance-based remuneration schemes, inefficient organizational \nand communication systems, and inadequate staff deployment and appraisal mechanisms. \nSectorwide policy issues\u2014organizational structures and institutional capacity, legislative and \nregulatory frameworks, decentralization, governance, and subsector performance monitoring\u2014\n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Bangladesh for the Primary Education Sector Improvement Project. Manila. \nThe amount includes $800,000 of ADB financing.  \n2  ADB 1997.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to \nBangladesh for the Second Primary Education Sector Project. Manila. ", "2 \nalso need to be further addressed to make a real impact on the quality of education in primary \nschools. An ADB-supported study of classroom behavior reveals that most teachers still use \nteaching  methods  inappropriate  for  the  age  group  and  curriculum.  Further,  the  external \nassistance to improve quality and efficiency has been somewhat fragmented. There is a need to \naddress the improvement of quality through a more holistic subsector program and to improve \nthe impact of aid support through better coordination of external assistance to the subsector \nthan has been the case under the current 5-year PEDP I. \n \n4.  Compared with PEDP I, the jointly prepared PEDP II for 2003-2008 has been designed \nas a holistic, coordinated, and integrated subsector program. PEDP II will focus on improving \nthe  quality  of  primary  education:  its  aim  is  to  strengthen  organizational  and institutional \ndevelopment  necessary  to  support  coordination,  subsector  planning,  management,  and \nmonitoring, to support and ensure efficient improvement of quality at the classroom level. PEDP \nII includes a set of core indicators and a common framework for support from the Government \nand its development partners.  \n \n5.  While at the systemic level PEDP II will focus on formal primary education where the \nvast majority of the children are enrolled, it will also promote the Government\u2019s education for all \n(EFA) and poverty reduction agenda. Most interventions of PEDP II will apply equally to all \nprimary schools, all teachers and all children, in Government schools and nongovernment \norganization  (NGO)  schools.  This  approach  will  help  the  Government  harmonize  the \ndevelopment and improvement of quality in the various subsystems and promote better primary \neducation across the country. \n \n6.  The PEDP II plan is a subsector macroplan that is large scale in terms of beneficiaries, \nparticipants, and funding. It is a holistic plan with proposed interventions affecting all sections of \nthe primary education subsector at all levels of the system. It has brought together a wide range \nof general and specific interests, especially those of the Government, development partners, \nand other stakeholders. Maintaining coordination and integration at operational level under the \numbrella of the new holistic subsector macroplan is a challenge and requires continuation of a \njoint planning process involving the Government and aid agencies. Other operational elements \nmust  now  be  added  to  the  planning  and  preparation  stages  to  ensure  the  effective \nimplementation of PEDP II, and to help the Government achieve a smooth transition from the \ncurrent PEDP I to PEDP II. To strengthen the capacity to undertake operational planning for and \nstart implementing PEDP II, the Government has requested ADB to continue assistance in \ncoordinating the joint process up to the start of PEDP II, scheduled on 1 July 2003. ADB will be \nable to meet this request partially  by extending the current PPTA up to February 2003 and \nutilizing the contingencies in the PPTA budget for the extension.3 The PPTA will complete the \ntask of fine-tuning the PEDP II subsector macroplan and preparing the ADB loan for PEDP II. \nHowever, after the PPTA there will be a need to support PMED and Directorate of Primary \nEducation (DPE) particularly in coordinating the transition from PEDP I to PEDP II, and in \noperational planning and preparation of operational procedures, implementing guidelines and \nmanuals well in advance to avoid delay in starting PEDP II. To meet the Government\u2019s request \nfully and provide support up to the start of PEDP II, it is necessary to provide advisory TA for the \nperiod from March 2003 to June 2003. Several development partners are keen to provide \nadditional TA for the transition period, particularly domestic consultants as necessary, to work \nwith the Government and the ADB TA.  \n \n                                                 \n3  ADB approved the extension of the PPTA period on 13 November 2002. ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The TA aims to help the Government develop its capacity in operational planning and \nimplementing PEDP II. The TA will cover the following areas:  \n \n(i)  Education planning and policy, with focus on strengthening the linkages between \nthe PEDP II policy framework and the operational plans being planned for the \nPEDP  II  interventions.  Attention  will  be  given  to  strengthening  the  synergy \nbetween the interventions, and their focus on improving the quality of primary \neducation,  poverty  reduction,  and  disadvantaged  groups.  Where  necessary, \nassistance will be provided for strengthening the linkages between PEDP II and \nthe Government\u2019s EFA planning process. \n \n(ii)  Program  coordination  and  management,  with  focus  on  moving  from  the \nfragmented project management structures in place under the current 5-year \nprogram to a coordinated and integrated subsector program coordination unit \nstructure for PEDP II; developing operational guidelines for coordinating and \nmanaging PEDP II, and for disseminating information to other levels of the \nsystem;  determining  mechanisms  for  aid  agency  and  systemic  coordination; \npreparing a procurement manual and other operation manuals necessary to \nefficiently implement PEDP II. \n \n(iii)  Organizational and institutional capacity analysis, with focus on procedures and \ninterventions needed for improving organizational and institutional structure and \ncapacity to support the improvement of the quality of primary education; based \non the recommendations of the analysis, develop an organizational/institutional \nreform agenda\u2014short-term and longer-term\u2014along with an action plan to ensure \nthat the best possible organizational structures and procedures are in place for \nensuring coordinated improvement of the quality of primary education under \nPEDP II.  \n \n(iv)  Development of EMIS, and monitoring and evaluation; completing a school audit \nand other baseline surveys; finalizing indicators; strengthening monitoring and \nevaluation of the quality of primary education, poverty reduction impact, and the \nbenefits of PEDP II implementation to disadvantaged groups. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The advisory TA will begin in March 2003 immediately after ADB's PPTA ends. It is \nimportant to have no gap between the PPTA and the advisory TA period. The TA will involve \nPMED, DPE, and the consultants provided by the development partners for the transition \nperiod. The TA will advise and assist PMED and DPE in planning and coordinating and \nfacilitating workshops involving key Government and program personnel, to build capacity and \nshare information relating to operational planning, and to ensure smooth transition from the \ncurrent fragmented project approach to the coordinated and integrated subsector program \napproach of PEDP II. The scope and activities involved are described in the TA framework in \nAppendix 1, and in the terms of reference for the TA in Appendix 2. \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n9.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $310,000 equivalent, consisting of $212,000 in \nforeign exchange cost, and $98,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The Government will contribute the balance of \n$60,000  equivalent  by  providing  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  and  facilities  for \nmeetings and workshops. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  PMED will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The TA will be implemented over 4 \nmonths, from March to June 2003. PMED will coordinate, steer, and monitor the TA on the \nbehalf of the Government. A technical assistance advisory committee (TAAC) will be formed for \nthe TA and chaired by the Joint Secretary (Development) of PMED. Members of the TAAC will \ninclude, the director general of DPE; directors of planning, finance, and monitoring of DPE; and \na representative of the Economic Relations Division of the Ministry of Finance. \n \n11.  The TA will require two individual international consultants, for 6 person-months in total, \nwith expertise in Bangladesh, particularly in education policy, planning, and management (2.5), \nand in improving the quality of primary education (3.5). In addition, the TA will have a domestic \nconsultant with extensive experience in planning and developing policy in primary education (4 \nperson-months). International consultants with international experience are necessary to advise \non  and  support  the  operational  planning  process  and  the  shift  from  fragmented  project \nmanagement structures to a coordinated and integrated subsector management structure, of \nwhich the PMED does not yet have in-depth experience. The consultants will be selected and \nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. Consultants will prepare \nreports for the Government and ADB according to the following schedule: an inception report 2 \nweeks after mobilization of the TA, progress reports for each month of the TA period, and a final \nreport by the end of the TA. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n12.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Bangladesh for the Strengthening Primary Education Development Program, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  5 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nOverall Goal       \nEconomic growth and  Sustained economic  Government statistics  Organizational and \npoverty reduction through  growth  and reports, reports of  human capacity, and \nimproved quality of primary    external aid agencies  other necessary \neducation  Poverty reduced  resources available for \nimprovement of primary \neducation \nPurpose       \nAdequate capacity within the  Transition processes  Technical assistance  Continued commitment of \nGovernment for the efficient  efficiently undertaken, and  (TA) consultants\u2019  the Government, \nand effective operational  PEDP II start-up effectively  progress reports,  development partners, \nplanning and implementation  operationalized by the  technical assistance  and other stakeholders to \nof the Primary Education  start of PEDP II period, 1  advisory committee  improving quality of \nDevelopment Program  July 2003  (TAAC) meetings  primary education \n(PEDP) II.  through implementation \nof PEDP II  \n \nOutputs:       \nEducation planning and  By 1 July 2003,   TA consultants  Development partners \npolicy, with focus on  operational plans of  reports, study reports,  provide, as agreed, \nstrengthening the linkages  interventions prepared.
