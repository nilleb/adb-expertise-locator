In the context of its efforts to reform the pension system, the Government of India asked \nthe  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  technical  assistance  (TA) 1   in  designing  a \ncomprehensive solution that will provide broad-based old age income security through pensions \nto the public, especially the informal2 sector workforce. The proposed TA is included in the India \ncountry  strategy  and  program  for  2006\u20132008  and  is  consistent  with  the  priorities  of  the \nGovernment and ADB, as expressed in the country strategy and program, and reflects the \ncontinuity of ADB\u2019s strategy in supporting India\u2019s pension system reforms.3 A TA Fact-Finding \nMission visited India in September 2006. The Mission reached agreement on the proposed TA \nwith the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance; Pension Fund Regulation \nand Development Authority (PFRDA); and other stakeholders, including the embassy of Japan \nin New Delhi.4 This report reflects ADB\u2019s findings and the understanding reached with the \nGovernment on the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  India lacks robust old age income security coverage, and cannot sustain the fiscal \nburden of its existing pension system. The recurrent expenditure for the central Government \npension system has grown from 0.6% of gross domestic product (GDP) in FY1993 to 1.7% in \nFY2002, while total pension liabilities have risen from 9.7% of net tax revenue to 12.7% during \nthe same period. A recent study5 estimated India\u2019s unfunded pension liability, expressed as the \nnet present value of future pensions for existing central and state government employees 21\u201360 \nyears old in 2004,6 at Rs1,735,527 crore (equivalent to about $426.9 billion)\u2014or 55.9% of \nGDP.7 Given the high ratio of national public debt to GDP at 84.9%, or Rs2,635,000 crore \n(equivalent  to  $648.2  billion),  the  contingent  liability  related  to  the  unfunded  pensions \ncompounds India\u2019s public debt problem. This indicates that the Government pension system is \ninadequately funded and unsustainable. \n \n3.  To address the adverse sustainability, the Government embarked in 2003 on wide-\nranging reforms of its pension system.8 Immediate measures included the establishment of an \ninterim  PFRDA,  and  introduction  of  a  defined  contributory  pension  system  so-called  new \npension system (NPS). Subsequently, the interim PFRDA has obtained legal status through an \nordinance promulgated on 29 December 2004. The PFRDA Bill (2005), which would provide \nPFRDA with permanent legal status, has not been passed yet. The passage of the PFRDA Act \n                                                 \n1  The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 14 November 2006. \n2  The Indian Government uses the term \u201cunorganized sector\u201d for the informal sector. \n3  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132008): India. Manila. Paragraphs 64 and 91 provide the rationale \nfor ADB support for the financial sector reform, including the pension system.  \n4  DEA-CMD confirmed the TA design on 4 May 2007. \n5  Bhardwaj, G. and S. Dave. 2006. Towards estimating India\u2019s implicit pension debt on account of employees\u2019 civil \nservice. India: Invest India Economic Foundation. \n6  The population of central and state government employees in this age group is 5.3 and 18.4 million, respectively. \n7  This does not include liabilities related to defense employees, central and state civil pensioners, and the funding \ngap in the Employees\u2019 Pension Scheme. \n8  ADB assisted India\u2019s reform of the (i) Employees\u2019 Provident Fund, providing coverage for old age income security \nfor private sector employees in ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to India for Reform of the Private Pension and \nProvident Funds System and Employees\u2019 Provident Fund Organization.

Technical Assistance to India for \nPension Reforms for the Unorganized Sector. Manila (TA4226-IND); and (iii) civil service pensions at the state level \nin ADB. 2004.

The latter has \nbeen provided in collaboration with the World Bank. \n ", "2   \nis important since the NPS is making substantial collections without an established setup of \nsupporting institutions. \n \n4.  The NPS gradually will replace the defined benefit pension scheme, as well as the \nGeneral Provident Fund for employees who have joined the service since 1 January 2004, \nexcept for the armed forces. Participation in the NPS is mandatory for central Government \nemployees. Civil servants of state governments and other public and private sector employees, \nself-employed professionals, and informal sector workers may join NPS voluntarily. By April \n2007, 19 of India\u2019s 28 states had adopted the NPS scheme for their own civil service staff \nthrough notification.9  \n \n5.  Although the bill defines the NPS policy framework and its structure, it empowers the \nPFRDA to specify implementation details.10 However, the interim PFRDA does not have the \nrequisite  skills,  experience,  and  resources  to  implement  the  bill;  and  the  supporting \ninfrastructure to implement the NPS has not been established and tested.11 The Government \nrecently started a process to establish a central record-keeping agency (CRA), and to recruit \npension fund managers (PFM). The full functionality of the CRA, the recruitment of qualified \nPFMs, and a nationwide network of pension service providers\u2014or points of presence (POP)\u2014\nare essential to develop and distribute suitable pension products.  \n \n6.  The central Government resorts to depositing employer and employee contributions in \nindividual accounts created in the Government\u2019s public account under an interim arrangement \nmanaged by the Controller General of Accounts and the Central Pension Accounting Office. As \na  result,  the  investment  returns  are  not  based  on  market  rates,  but  on  administratively \ndetermined  interest  rates  identical  to  the  General  Provident  Fund  accounts  for  employees \nappointed before the NPS reforms. This has undermined public confidence in the NPS, which is \nthe most critical factor for the successful implementation of pension reforms. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n7.  The TA will assist the Government in designing and implementing the NPS and a solution \nproviding broad-based old age income security to the civil servants (central and states) and \npublic, especially the informal sector workforce. Building public confidence in the NPS vis-\u00e0-vis \nthe current pay-as-you-go scheme is a key to the success of the NPS. This requires PFRDA to \n(i)  provide  proper  pension  products  with  adequate  coverage;  and  (ii)  develop  marketing \nchannels through service providers, POPs, and supporting institutions, such as the CRA and \nPFMs. In addition, POPs need to become capable of delivering quality services to targeted \nbeneficiaries, including sales and promotions, to widen participation in the scheme and regular \npension contributions. The TA will conduct a study on unregulated pension funds, the so-called \n\u201cexcluded funds\u201d to help the Government formulate a suitable policy and regulatory framework. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9  These include Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chattisgarh, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, \nJharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh,  Maharashtra, Manipur, Orissa, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh \nand  Uttaranchal  (Source:  Indian  Pension  Sector  Encyclopedia,  Invest  India  Economic  Foundation  (IIEF): \nhttp://iief.com/indiapensions).  \n10 The bill envisages PFRDA to regulate all intermediaries under the NPS, including pension funds, CRA, and POPs . \nIt will approve the terms and conditions of a scheme, and lay down norms for the management of pension funds. \n11 The infrastructure needs to be tested to come up with the most cost-effective way to implement the NPS.  \n ", "  3\nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The expected impact is the successful introduction of the NPS and a comprehensive old \nage income security system in India. This would reduce the fiscal burden for the government at \nthe central and state levels, and widen the coverage of old age income security for the workers \nin the informal sector. It also will contribute to the development of the national capital market in \nIndia, as pension funds are important sources for long-term funding. \n \n9.  The TA will enable the Government and PFRDA to formulate strategies and measurable \naction plans, and develop and field test pension products, before rolling out the NPS to the \nformal and informal sectors. The NPS would encourage greater participation from state civil \nservants and individual pensioners, as well as informal sector workers. The TA will help the \nGovernment and PFRDA develop a database to determine the informal sector workers\u2019 demand \nand ability to pay for voluntary retirement contributions, and the nature and the size of the \nexcluded  funds.  Conferences  and  workshops  will  be  held  to  disseminate  and  discuss  TA \nfindings, and to sensitize stakeholders to potential reforms.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will provide assistance in (i) raising awareness regarding workers\u2019 participation in \nthe NPS; (ii) evaluating the effectiveness of NPS institutional support mechanisms and the \nability of the POPs to deliver quality services, including sales, promotions, collection, pooling, \nand transfer of pension savings to the CRA and PFMs; (iii) assessing the effectiveness of \nservice delivery and adequacy of benefits under existing schemes, and developing strategies for \neffective service delivery networks (iv) developing products; and (v) studying excluded funds. \nProduct development would include the formulation and field testing in four selected districts12 to \ntest market demand, and the informal sector workers\u2019 ability to pay for such products.  \n \n11.  An international consultant will be the project leader with the necessary experience in \nlaunching and managing a voluntary pension system in developing countries. India does not \nhave any experience in launching and managing the NPS.  \n \n12.  For field-testing, the TA will support overall design and implementation of activities to \nmaximize impact, and recommend approaches for mass rollout to low-income beneficiaries. \nSubtasks,  such  as  advertisements,  literature,  films,  surveys,  and  related  research,  will  be \noutsourced to advertising agencies and local specialists.  \n \n13.  At the district level, a team of local staff will monitor the implementation of the field test \ncomponents. In addition, it will network with local schools, industry associations, cooperatives, \nchambers, microfinance institutions, and nongovernmental organizations for the rollout. Local \nagencies  (banks,  post  offices,  microfinance  institutions)  also  will  be  harnessed  to  deliver \npromotional and educational campaigns to targeted households. To this end, the team will \nundertake  training  and  institutional  capacity  building  to  enable  regulated  service  delivery \nagencies to participate as POPs under the NPS.  \n \n14.  The TA also will conduct a study on unregulated pension and provident funds that entails \nconsultations with regulators, policy makers, and employers. Further, it will develop a database \non these funds to recommend policy and regulatory reforms aimed at the excluded funds.   \n \n                                                 \n12  Within four regions (north, south, east, and west) and consisting of two urban and two rural districts. \n ", "4   \nC.  Costs and Financing \n \n15.  The Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, will finance the TA on a \ngrant basis. The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1.1 million, of which ADB would \nprovide $1 million to finance consulting services, training and workshops, and promotional \nliterature. The Government would finance the remainder, equivalent to $100,000.  The cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The Ministry of Finance, DEA-CMD, will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and will \nprovide the necessary office space, counterpart support, and other services to the consultants \nthroughout the TA. The consultants will establish a monitoring arrangement to enable DEA-\nCMD to evaluate the TA\u2019s progress and outcomes. PRFDA is the Implementing Agency.  \n \n17.  The TA is expected to start by early July 2007 and be completed by December 2008. The \nconsulting team will include two international consultants (20 person-months) and six national \nconsultants  (49  person-months).  An  international  consulting  firm  is  preferred  to  lead  the \nassignment. The international consultants will associate with a national professional consulting \nfirm with expertise and experience in pension policy, as well as system design, reform, and \nimplementation.  The  national  consulting  firm  will  support  the  lead  firm\u2019s  overall  project \nmanagement, including coordinating various tasks and deliverables under the TA in the districts \nselected for pilot testing, between DEA (and PFRDA) and the districts, and between PFRDA \nand DEA-CMD.  \n \n18.  International  consultants  will  comprise  a  pension  system  and  financial  expert  (team \nleader), and a pension product scheme and development expert. The national consultants will \ncomprise (i) pension system expert, (ii) communications and publicity expert, (iii) process and \ninformation technology expert, (iv) social sector expert, (v) legal expert, and (vi) pension system \nand policy expert. The international consulting firm will be recruited using simplified technical \nproposals  under  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The terms of \nreference are in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  The international consulting firm will submit a work plan for the TA to DEA-CMD and ADB \nwithin 2 weeks of starting its services in the field. This will include the planned activities, \nmethodologies, and outputs of the TA. The start of services would allow for a proper interface \nwith the local publicity firm before finalizing the design of the public awareness program for the \ndistricts selected for pilot testing. The consulting firm will submit an inception report within 4 \nweeks of starting its services in the field. Within 9\u201312 months of TA inception, the consulting \nfirm will be expected to complete the (i) design of the pilot, as well as implementation of the pilot \ncomponents and networking with local institutions; (ii) overall design and implementation of \nactivities and interventions, impact measurement, and recommendations for the mass rollout of \nNPS, based on the outcome of the pilot; (iii) development of strategies for providing low-cost \naccess to low-income informal sector workers; and (iv) assessment of unregulated funds and \nprovident  funds  to  build  the  database,  and  come  up  with  suitable  policy  and  regulatory \nprovisions for these funds.  \n \n20.  Upon completion of the pilot testing in the selected districts, the consultants will undertake \ntwo  quarterly  impact  assessments,  which  will  include  sample  surveys  and  focus  group \ndiscussions among members and eligible nonmembers, and interviews with POPs. Thereafter, \n ", "  5\nthe consultants will submit a detailed report regarding the activities associated with the launch of \nthe NPS in the pilot district, as well as a detailed report on the periodic impact assessments. A \nworkshop will be held with stakeholders, including representatives from the DEA-CMD, PFRDA, \nthe consulting firm, and ADB, to present the findings for the pilot testing. This will become an \ninput for the design and implementation for the mass rollout of the NPS. A separate workshop \nwill be held with stakeholders, including representatives from DEA-CMD, tax authority, PFRDA, \nthe consulting firm, ADB, market participants (PFMs and annuity providers), to disseminate the \nfindings  of  the  study  on  excluded  funds,  which  will  become  an  input  for  the  final \nrecommendations for the study. \n \n21.  Two interim reports will be submitted, one at the end 6 months and the other at the end of \n12 months. A draft final report will be submitted, which will be the basis of discussions in a \ntripartite meeting among DEA-CMD, the consulting firm, and ADB to be held 2 weeks before the \nfinalization  of  the  report.  This  meeting  will  consider  the  results  of  the  strategies,  market \nsegmentation, devised pension product schemes, and the plan implementation of the pension \nprogram. \n \nIV.
