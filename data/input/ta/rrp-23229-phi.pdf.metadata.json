The  two  related  loans  will  assist  the  Government  in\nimproving the quality and relevance of technical education and skills\ndevelopment (TESD) in the public and private sectors.\nA. TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT PROJECT\nBorrower Republic of the Philippines\nProject Description The Project will assist the Government in (i) strengthening the role\nand  capacity  of  the  Technical  Education  and  Skills  Development\nAuthority (TESDA), (ii) devolving TESDA\u2019s responsibilities for training\ninstitutions to  local  government  units  (LGUs),  (iii)  strengthening  the\ncapacity of the private providers of TESD, and (iv) enhancing equity in\nskills acquisition among the poor. To effect these changes, the Project\nwill  prepare  TESDA-administered  institutions  for  devolution,  and\nupgrade the curricula, delivery systems, and facilities of about 25\npublic TESD institutions and 45 provincial training centers.\nThe Project will institutionalize quality assurance programs in public\nand private institutions. To enhance access to TESD programs the\nProject will establish a scholarship fund and a student loan fund for\nthe poor. The Project will strengthen technical, pedagogical, and\nmanagement training at the school and local levels.\nClassification Primary:  human development\nSecondary:  poverty reduction\nEnvironmental Category  C.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no\nAssessment significant adverse environmental impacts were identified.\nRationale In the Medium-Term Philippines Development Plan, the Government\nemphasizes \u201ceconomic growth with social equity\u201d and the importance of\nthe private sector in \u201cenhancing industrial competitiveness\u201d in the global\neconomy.  This  policy  calls  for  the  development  of  a  highly  skilled\nworkforce  that  could  contribute  to  the  economy  to  enhance  its\ncompetetiveness in international markets. To meet these requirements,\nthe  TESD  system, as  the main  provider  of  technicians  and  skilled\nworkers, must be responsive to rapidly changing technology and the\ndemands  of  industry.  TESD  programs  must  be  flexible,  industry-\noriented, and demand-driven. The present TESD system with its supply-\ndriven orientation, outdated  curricula, poor facilities,  and  inadequate\nteaching equipment cannot effectively produce  the skilled  workforce\nrequired by the economy. Promoting \u201csocial equity\u201d requires that the\npoor have wider access to services, including better opportunities for", "ii\nskills  training  and  employment  with  necessary  support.  ADB\u2019s\nintervention  through  the  Project  will  help  upgrade  the  quality  and\nrelevance of TESD programs in the public and private sectors, provide\nfinancial support through scholarships and loans to the poor to enable\nthem  to  acquire  employable  skills,  and  assist  them  in  finding\nemployment. The Project will assist the Government in strengthening the\nmanagement capacity of the TESD system. TESDA, the main regulatory\nbody for the TESD subsector, will divest itself of responsibilities for the\nprovision of training and will be strengthened to focus on its function as\nan oversight agency.\nObjectives The main objective is to enhance the competitiveness of the Philippines\nand Scope through the improved quality and relevance of its TESD system and to\nenable TESDA to perform its function more effectively as an oversight\nagency to better respond to market demand for highly skilled workers.\nThe secondary objective is to help reduce poverty through enhanced\nequity  to  TESD  programs  for  the  poor,  with  financial  support  and\nservices  to  enable  them  to  acquire  employable  skills  and  gainful\nemployment.\nThe Project has four components: (i) strengthening the central training\nagency (TESDA), (ii) devolving training functions to local institutions,\n(iii) strengthening  the  capacity  of  private  providers  of  TESD,  and\n(iv) enhancing  equity  in  skills  acquisition  among  the  poor.  Under\ncomponent (ii), 25 public schools and centers and 45 provincial training\ncenters  will  be  upgraded  in  preparation  for  devolution.  Through\ncomponent (iii), the Project will help improve the quality of 240 private\nTESD institutions. The Project will institutionalize quality assurance and\naccreditation  systems,  occupational  standards,  equivalency  and\ncertification systems, skills testing systems, career counseling, and job\nplacement programs and services. Under component (iv), the Project\nwill provide the poor with scholarships and loans in TESD programs in\nprivate and public institutions.\nCost Estimates The estimated total cost of the Project is $70 million equivalent, of\nwhich $27.34 million (39.1 percent) is the foreign exchange cost and\n$42.66 million equivalent (60.9 percent) is the local currency cost.\nFinancing Plan                                                                                                ($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nSource Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nADB 9.34 15.66 25.00 35.7\nNordic Development Fund 8.00 0 8.00 11.4\nOPEC Fund 0 7.00 7.00 10.0\nDANIDA 10.00 0 10.00 14.3\nGovernment of the\nPhilippines 0 20.00 20.00 28.6\nTotal 27.34 42.66 70.00 100.0\nDANIDA \u2013 Danish Agency for International Development", "iii\nLoan Amount ADB will provide a loan of $25 million from its ordinary capital resources\nand Terms (OCR) to finance 34.2 percent of the foreign exchange costs and 36.7\npercent of local currency costs.

International competitive\nbidding procedures will be applied for supply contracts estimated to cost the\nequivalent  of  $500,000  or  more.  Supply  contracts    valued  at  less  than\n$500,000 equivalent will follow international shopping procedures, except that\nsupply contracts with a  value of  less  than $100,000 equivalent  may be\nprocured by direct purchase. Civil works contracts to be financed 100 percent\nby  Organization  of  Petroleum  Exporting  Countries  (OPEC)  Fund  for\nInternational Development are expected to be small and local competitive\nbidding procedures will be applied.\nConsulting Services A total of 176 person-months of consulting services will be provided\ncomprising  of  65  person-months  of  international  consultants  and\n111 person-months  of  domestic  consultants  to  support  TESDA  in\nprogram development and institutional capacity building. All international\nconsultants will be selected and engaged through a firm in accordance\nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other\narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic\nconsultants.\nEstimated Project 30 June 2006\nCompletion Date\nB.  FUND FOR TECHNICAL EDUCATION AND SKILLS DEVELOPMENT\nBorrower Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)\nProject Description Enrollments in private TESD institutions represent approximately 80 percent\nof the total number of students in the TESD subsector. As part of component\n(iii) of the TESDP, ADB will provide a loan of Y2,166,700,000 to DBP to set\nup and manage the FTESD. DBP will provide subloans to private institutions\nnationwide to upgrade the quality of their TESD programs. DBP will monitor", "iv\nthe use of the loan funds  to ensure that the borrowing institutions follow the\nprocedures and requirements of the FTESD. In a preliminary survey of the\nprivate institutions, more than 150 indicated interest in borrowing from the\nFTESD with loan amounts ranging from $25,000 to $500,000. The majority\nwant to borrow between $75,000 and $250,000. Approximately 120 private\nschools are expected to  benefit from the FTESD.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the FTESD is Y2,166,700,000, of which Y1,516,690,000 (70\npercent) is the estimated foreign exchange cost for purchase of equipment,\ninstructional materials, and books, and Y650,010,000 (30 percent) is the local\ncurrency cost.\nLoan Amount and ADB will provide a loan in the amount of Y2,166,700,000 through the market-\nTerms based loan window. The loan will have an amortization period of 15 years,\nincluding a grace period of 5 years and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent\nper annum. It will have a fixed interest rate for the first ten years, with an option\nto convert to a floating rate on the tenth year. DBP will pay to ADB a front-end\nfee in an amount equal to one percent of the loan amount. The fee will be\ncapitalized in the loan.\nDBP will provide subloans to eligible private providers of TESD at 80\npercent  of  the  total  project  cost  from  ADB  loan,  with  the  borrower\ncontributing the remaining 20 percent in the form of equity participation.\nThe loan will have a maximum period of 10 years with a grace period of 6-\n24 months. The indicative interest rate as approved by the Department of\nFinance  is  11.5-14  percent  plus  a  front-end  fee  of  1  percent  and\ncommitment  fee  of  0.75 percent  per  annum  to  be  charged  on  the\nundisbursed portion of the loan. The minimum and maximum subloan\namounts will be the equivalent of $25,000 and $1,000,000, respectively.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 31 December 2006\nExecuting Agency Development Bank of the Philippines\nImplementation DBP will assign a team of qualified staff at its headquarters to manage the\nArrangements FTESD.

I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to the Republic of the Philippines for the Technical Education and Skills Development\nProject, (ii) a proposed loan to the Development Bank of the Philippines for the Fund for\nTechnical Education and Skills Development, and (iii) the proposed administration by ADB of a\nloan for the Project to be  provided by the  Organization of Petroleum  Exporting  Countries\n(OPEC) Fund for International Development. The Report also describes proposed technical\nassistance for Strengthening Management Capacity and Improving Quality of the Technical\nEducation and Skills Development System, and if the proposed loans are approved by the\nBoard, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the technical\nassistance.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In its efforts to improve its global competitiveness, the Philippines has placed emphasis\non developing a highly skilled workforce through its technical education and skills development\n(TESD)  system  (Appendix  A).  This  calls  for  much  greater  attention  to  and  investment  in\nvocational and technical education. In response to the Government\u2019s request, in 1996 the Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance (TA)1 to prepare a Technical Education\nand Skills Development Project. The TA was completed on 15 October 1998. In early 1999, the\nADB-funded  Philippines  Education  Sector  Study2  (PESS)  was  completed.  It  included  a\ncomprehensive review of the education and training system. The final  report  stressed  the\nimportance of the skills development system in strengthening the overall competitiveness of\nPhilippine industry. The key findings emphasized the important role played by the private sector\nand the need to improve access to skills training for the disadvantaged groups.\n3. An Appraisal Mission was fielded from 15 November to 3 December 1999 to review and\nfinalize the technical, financial, institutional, and social aspects of the Project. Discussions with\nthe  three  cofinanciers\u2014Nordic  Development  Fund,  Danish  Ministry  of  Foreign Affairs,  and\nOPEC  Fund for  International  Development\u2014continued  after appraisal  until  agreement  was\nreached  in  May  2000.  Throughout  project  preparation,  there  was  close  consultation  and\ncoordination with government officials and representatives of private TESD providers at central,\nprovincial, and school levels, as well as with students, nongovernment organizations (NGOs),\ngraduates,  and  business  and  industry  representatives.  The  project  framework  is  given  in\nAppendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n4. The Philippines faces two overarching issues in the early 21st century. It must find ways\nto continue and accelerate its global competitiveness and it must achieve major reductions in\npoverty.\n                                               \n1  TA 2627-PHI: Second Technical and Vocational Education Project, for $480,000, approved on 16 August 1996.\n2  Asian Development Bank and World Bank. 1999. Philippine Education for the 21st Century: The 1998 Philippines\nEducation Sector Study Technical Background Paper No. 4: Technical-Vocational Education and Training in the\nPhilippines.", "2\n1. Competitiveness and the Labor Force3\n5. The competitiveness of Philippine manufacturing in global markets is centrally important\nto continued economic growth and poverty reduction. As noted  in  The  Philippine  National\nDevelopment Plan: Directions for the 21st Century,4 economic growth and modernization can\naccelerate much faster when there is sufficient access to the world\u2019s markets, resources and\nknow-how. However, if industry remains inefficient and uncompetitive, liberalization may lead to\na net income loss and a widening of the gap between rich and poor. Accordingly, the goal of\nmeeting the challenges of globalization has been coupled with the goal of reducing poverty and\ninequality.\n6. The comparative advantage of the Philippines in the future lies not in unskilled labor, but\nrather  in  low-end  \u201chigh-tech\u201d  areas  such  as  electronics  manufacturing  and  software\ndevelopment. Data show high growth rates in exports of products requiring skilled labor and a\nvery low growth or stagnation of those based on unskilled labor. There has been a sharp decline\nin resource-based manufactures, a steady decline in labor-intensive products, and a dramatic\nincrease  in  science-based  goods,  including  those  that  are  technologically  complex.  For\nexample, the Philippines is now the second largest exporter of software in Asia after India. The\nworld market for software exports is vast and growing.5\n7. The Philippines is competitive in skill-intensive products because of a relatively large\neducated and trainable workforce. The country has considerable headroom for further growth in\nvalue-added manufactured products owing to the strong world demand for such products, the\ncurrent small market share, and lack of vulnerability to easy entry by low-wage producers.\nConsiderable scope also exists for upgrading production facilities and the skills of the workforce.\nHowever, the base of growth remains narrow and the high degree of export concentration is\ncause for concern. The export-oriented sector has relatively shallow roots in the domestic\neconomy, with low local content and few technological linkages. In strengthening these roots,\nthe Philippines should adopt policies to ensure technological and skills upgrading6 and aim to\nincrease the value added of its products. This strategy has major implications for TESD. Raising\nproductivity, essential for improved competitiveness, depends largely on improving the quality of\neducation and training at postbasic levels.7\n8. The  Philippines  faces  substantial  challenges  to  successfully  compete  in  the  world\nmarket. Sustained growth in the global markets will require deepening of the technological\ncompetence of enterprises and workers. Increases in skills and productivity of the labor force\nare necessary to increase the quality and value of output without raising labor costs beyond\ncompetitive levels. Higher productivity also leads to better earnings that enable workers to share\nin the benefits of growth.\n9. Although the Philippines has a relatively well-educated workforce, only a small minority\nof the labor force have had relevant skills training. As the ADB Country Operational Strategy8\n                                               \n3 The following section is based in part on the PESS report.\n4 Government of the Philippines 1998. The Philippine National Development Plan: Directions for the 21st Century\nPart 2, pp. 13-14.\n5 World Bank, 1997. Managing Global Integration, Washington D.C.: World Bank. p.40.\n6 Ibid., pp. 31, 33-34.\n7 Ibid., p. 22.\n8 STS: PHI28-98: Country Operational Strategy Study, Philippines, April 1998.", "3\npointed out, less than 6 percent of the labor force had appropriate technical skills. This is clearly\ninadequate as a basis for maintaining and improving competitiveness. To be competitive in\nworld markets, the Philippines needs to continuously improve the skills and productivity of its\nworkforce. Labor productivity depends on many factors, including the quality of management\nand the nature of production technology. The skills of the workforce, and the ability of workers to\nmove efficiently across sectors as the economy changes are centrally important. The skills and\nflexibility of the workforce make important contributions to the competitiveness of an economy in\nglobal markets.\n10. Overall, the workforce will require continuing improvement in basic education over the\nlong term to ensure that the majority of the population is well equipped with knowledge and\nskills required in the age of globalization. Continuing improvements in the quality and efficiency\nof postbasic education and training, especially TESD, are also important.\n2. Poverty Reduction\n11. The second major challenge for the Philippines is to raise the productivity and incomes\nof the poorer segments of the population. The Philippines has made some progress in reducing\nthe incidence of poverty from 35.5 percent of households in 1994 to 32.1 percent in 1997. For\nthe population as a whole, poverty incidence declined from 40.6 percent in 1994 to 37.5 percent\nin 1997. This means that in 1997, 27.25 million Filipinos fell below the official poverty line of an\nannual per capita income of $285 equivalent (P11,388). In general, poverty incidence levels in\nrural areas in each geographic region are higher than in urban areas. Mindanao remains the\npoorest  area  with  50.9  percent  of  the  population  below  the  poverty  line,  compared  with\n45.4 percent in Visayas, 35.7 percent in Luzon, and 9.6 percent in the National Capital Region.\nThe difference between urban and rural areas is stark: 18.5 percent of the population in urban\nareas have annual income below the poverty line compared with 44.4 percent in rural areas.9\n12. The downward trend in poverty incidence suffered a setback at the end of 1998 because\nof the Asian financial crisis and the inclement weather that reduced agricultural production on\nwhich  most  poor  households  depend.  A  household  survey  for  an  ADB-financed  study10\nestimated that the proportion of families who rated themselves poor rose from 40 percent in\n1997 to 43 percent in 1999. The data clearly indicate the need to pay more attention to rural\npoverty reduction. One of the key means to escape poverty is empowerment with education and\nemployable skills.\n13. Social indicators in the Philippines show positive developments in recent years. The\ncountry\u2019s Human Development Index (HDI) improved from 0.711 in 1990 to 0.740 in 1999.11 The\nPhilippines  was  placed  77th  in  HDI  global  ranking  among  174  countries  and  compared\nreasonably well with its neighboring countries such as Thailand (HDI, 0.753), Malaysia (HDI,\n0.768) and Indonesia (HDI, 0.681). Within the country, the trend is also encouraging. In 1994,\nMetro Manila had an average HDI of 0.925 and five provinces in Luzon enjoyed a high average\nHDI ranging from 0.774 to 0.840. Provinces with the lowest HDI, ranging from 0.372 to 0.445,\nwere mainly in Mindanao.\n                                               \n9   National Statistics Coordination Board 1999. 1997 Philippines Poverty Statistics.\n10 Reyes, C.M., R.G.

Technical Education and Skills Development\n14. A well-designed and managed TESD system can play a significant role in supporting the\nGovernment policy of enhancing global competitiveness by producing a highly qualified and\ncompetitive workforce for the economy. It can also serve as a means to reduce poverty by\nexpanding  training  opportunities  and  increasing  access  to  skills  training  to  promote\nentrepreneurship and self-employment among the poor. The Government recognized this fact\nwhen it created the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) in 1994\nwith  the  mandate  to  \u201cpromote  and  strengthen  the  quality  of  TESD  programs  to  attain\ninternational competitiveness.\u201d\n15. Skills training in the Philippines has three distinguishing characteristics: (i) the existence\nof a comprehensive agency (i.e., TESDA) overseeing all levels and types of training, (ii) a\ncomplex network of training providers, and (iii) the high proportion of skills training provided by\nthe private sector.\n16.  TESD is coordinated by a single agency (TESDA) covering all aspects of the system,\nincluding  school-based,  center-based,  community-based,  and  enterprise-based  training.  In\n1994, by recommendation of the Congressional Commission on Education, all types of middle\nlevel skills development (MLSD) were integrated under TESDA. TESDA combined the former\nBureau of Technical and Vocational Education under the Department of Education, Culture and\nSports (DECS), the former National Manpower and Youth Council dealing with nonformal skills\ntraining; and apprenticeship training programs of the Department of Labor and Employment.\n17. The structure of TESD is complex. Nearly all preemployment TESD training takes place\nafter  the  completion  of  secondary  school.  Training  is  delivered  in  a  bewildering  array  of\ninstitutions, including schools, institutes, and colleges. Each may include multiple levels and\ntypes  of  programs  including  secondary,  postsecondary,  degree,  and  even  postgraduate\ncourses. A comparatively large share of skills training is provided in tertiary institutions, perhaps\nreflecting the short duration of the basic education cycle (only 10 years, with the result that high\nschool graduates are young) and also the high cultural value attached to certification. Public\nstate universities and colleges (SUCs) absorb more than half of the total public spending on\nTESD.\n18.  Sixty percent of all training institutions are private but they accommodate 80 percent of\ntotal enrollments in institution-based middle-level skills development. This makes the Philippines\nunique in the world. Private TESD is financed almost exclusively from nonpublic sources, mainly\nby tuition fees and endowment income. In contrast with other countries, there is little or no\ngovernment subsidy12 for private training.\n19. In addition, sizable firms  in the  manufacturing  sector  show surprising dynamism  in\ntraining their own workers. A recent survey shows that 60 percent of firms provided systematic\ntraining for employees and invested significantly in training.13 Virtually all those firms employed\nmore than 50 persons. Smaller firms also provide training, although less often and less formally,\n                                               \n12 Minor exceptions are public scholarships for students in private education, Private Education Student Fund\nAssistance, which covers only about 3 percent of the students enrolled in formal private training institutions; and\nTraining Assistance Contracts under the World Bank-financed Second Vocational Training Project (1992-1998).\n13 Gray, L. 1996.

The figures for large firms are comparable\nwith enterprise commitments to training in other middle-income countries.\n20. Thus,  the Philippines  has been  successful  in  establishing  an  extensive  system  for\neducation and training that has contributed to economic and social goals. However, there are\nconcerns about (i) the role, responsibilities, and management capacity of TESDA; (ii) quality and\nrelevance of TESD programs; (iii) constraints faced by private providers of TESD relative to\naccess to capital; and (iv) equitable access to TESD programs by the poor.\n4. Issues in TESD\n21. Actions in the four areas in para. 20 could make a substantial impact both on Philippine\ncompetitiveness  and  on  poverty  reduction,  namely:  (i)  further  rationalizing  TESDA\u2019s\nresponsibilities to enable the agency to focus on policy and quality assurance; (ii) improving the\nquality  and  relevance of  training;  (iii)  improvement  and  expansion  of  private  training;  and\n(iv) removing barriers to equitable access for skills development.\na. TESDA\u2019s Role, Responsibilities, and Capacity for Management\n22. TESDA was established in 1994 as a policy and quality-assurance agency for postbasic\nTESD.14 In the first years of its existence, much of TESDA\u2019s attention was consumed by the\nneed to integrate various organizational units and the first year of full operation was 1997.\nTESDA\u2019s  mandate  as  the  national  training  authority  is  to  establish  a  supportive  policy\nenvironment  for  middle-level  skills  development;  to  improve  quality  through  standards,\naccreditation and monitoring,  research  and  development,  and  technical  assistance;  and  to\nensure equity in the training system. The bulk of TESD will continue to come from the private\nsector and from enterprises that offer training on the job. Accordingly, TESDA\u2019s role in training\nneeds to be rationalized. TESDA inherited the administration of 58 technical and vocational\nschools and about 60 nonformal training centers. The operation of training centers consumes\nabout two thirds of TESDA\u2019s budget and considerable staff time. It is not appropriate that the\nagency that accredits and supervises training institutions also runs them. \n23. Another issue of management effectiveness concerns a major gap in the breadth of\nTESDA\u2019s role in middle-level skills supervision. TESDA is charged with providing professional\noversight of all middle-level skills development\u2014formal and nonformal\u2014including semiskilled,\nskilled,  and  technician  levels.  TESDA  has  oversight  responsibility  for  private  formal  and\nnonformal education mainly through its registration and accreditation system. However, it has\nno mechanism to provide input and guidance into the various kinds of training provided within\nSUCs.\n24. In sum, TESDA needs to rationalize its operations\u2014including divesting its responsibility\nfor direct administration of training operations, making the process of standards and certification\nmore  efficient,  placing  more  emphasis  on  its  supporting  role  in  systems  monitoring  and\ninformation dissemination, and closing gaps in its span of supervision. Once this process of\nrationalization  is  completed,  TESDA  will  have  freed  up  staff  resources  for  higher  priority\nactivities, including policy and standards development, training materials support, and overall\nmonitoring of the system. One priority area is in information systems and data collection to\nimprove the information base for research on TESD. The existing management information\n                                               \n14 See Appendix C for organizational chart of TESDA.", "6\nsystem (MIS) developed under the World Bank-financed Second Vocational Training Project15\nneeds to be strengthened. Training providers need better labor market information to adjust and\nfocus their programs.\nb. Quality and Relevance of TESD\n25. The performance of the TESD system is best measured by the employment rates of\ngraduates, but little current information exists about the performance of the system in placing\ngraduates in employment. Many administrators of TESD schools and centers stated that the\ngraduates are too mobile to be tracked systematically after graduation. Data from the early\n1990s, as quoted in the  1994  Congressional  Commission  on  Education  report,  claim  that\nabsorption rates at all levels and types of TESD were low. Employment rates were 31 percent\namong  graduates  of  postsecondary  nondegree  courses.  The  best  performance  was  by\ngraduates from schools with short-term (generally nonformal) courses who achieve a 54 percent\nemployment rate.16 Placement rates increased substantially in the mid-1990s as job creation\nsurged and employment prospects brightened. Anecdotal evidence supports this. Institutions\nquote  absorption  rates  from  50  percent  upward  to  95  percent  for  the  better  institutions.\nHowever, employment rates appear to have declined during the economic downturn of the late\n1990s. This remains speculative until more data are collected. TESDA needs to do more,\ndirectly or through schools, to collect timely and reliable information about the employment\nstatus and economic performance  of  TESD graduates  of  institutions of  various  types  and\nlocations.\n26. TESDA has introduced trade testing almost exclusively for skills at the technician and\nmiddle-level craftsman level. More than 220 trade tests have been developed. Their scope and\ndepth are considered appropriate as they are validated by employers. The tests are taken\nmainly by students completing their studies, rather than workers in employment. The tests give\na useful proxy measure of the quality of skills attainment of the graduates. Unfortunately, the\nperformance  achievements  are  not  high.  Only  about  49  percent  of  those  who  took  the\nexaminations  in  1995  passed,  and  the  average  declined  to  38  percent  in  1998.  This\nexceptionally low result is a worrisome indicator of pervasive low quality in the system.\n27. One explanation for low quality is the wide variance in inputs needed for high standards\nin training. Trainers tend to have strong academic qualifications, but lack skills qualifications and\nindustrial experience. Only about 30 percent of the trainers had trade certification and only\n9 percent had industrial experience.17 Both private and public institutions tend to suffer from\nshortages of equipment and budgets for consumable training supplies.\n28. The program of skill testing, valuable as an exit standard of quality attained, needs to be\nextended  to  cover  more  occupations  and  expanded  by  establishing  more  testing  centers\nthroughout the country.\n                                               \n15 World Bank, Philippines: Second Vocational Training Project (Credit 2392-PH), for $36 million, approved in June\n1992.\n16 Congressional Commission on Education. 1994.

In terms of relevance, the curricula, training equipment, and training methodologies in\nthe majority of institutes have lagged behind the rapid changes and development in business\nand industry. Training curricula tend to be rigid and static. Regardless of the local demand\nTESDA\u2019s  regional  training  centers  give  training  in  seven  occupations  such  as  welding,\nautomechanics, and carpentry that were identified in the early 1970s. One survey of training for\nmanufacturing found  that  three  fourths  of  the  institutions  had  not  updated  or  revised  the\ncurriculum during the previous five years.18 Clearly, there is an urgent need to improve the\nquality  and  relevance of  TESD  skills  training  programs  to  produce  highly  qualified  skilled\nworkers for the economy.\n30. TESDA has taken initiatives to improve the situation in three areas. It has introduced a\nsystem19 of registration and accreditation designed to ensure that new programs and institutions\nmeet minimum levels of quality. Both private and public institutions must seek advance approval\nfor all courses and pass a minimum threshold for authorization. If sensibly administered, this\nsystem promises to stimulate substantial changes and improvements in private education. It will\neliminate some of the fly-by-night operators of doubtful repute. It will cause others to merge or\nundertake improvement programs.\n31. TESDA has converted TESD programs to a system of competency-based training, which\ninvolves  employers  in  identifying  competencies  required  for  particular  occupations  and\ndeveloping training modules focused on achieving those outputs. Competency-based training is\npart of the new registration and accreditation program. This system promises to make TESD\nmore effective by focusing on the essentials and eliminating unnecessary content from training.\nTESDA is also providing positive incentives for quality improvement in training through its\nannual awards for training excellence. These provide considerable leverage on the system\nwithout much cost.\n32. Other initiatives include TESDA\u2019s role in the development of trade standards. Over the\npast two years TESDA, with industry participation, has identified seven priority sectors and\ndeveloped 13 training regulations comprising trade standards plus competency-based curricula,\nwhich will be gradually introduced. The standards will enable training institutions and employers\nto assess the quality of graduates more objectively based on the identified competencies.\n33. Programs for quality assurance are embryonic. TESDA has initiated several programs\ndesigned to improve the quality and relevance of TESD systemwide, but needs much more\nsupport to be able to implement them properly. Specifically, assistance is needed to support\nTESDA in programming, refining, and implementing these quality improvement programs. In\naddition, substantial capital investment is needed to replenish and update equipment and train\nstaff in new fields and training methodologies.\nc. Constraints on the Private Providers of TESD\n34. Private TESD institutions enroll about 80 percent of total TESD students. In general, the\nprivate TESD schools are more cost-effective than their public counterparts. On a per student\nbasis, private training costs less than public training. One study found that for skilled worker and\ntechnician-level training, private costs per graduate were only 70 percent and  45 percent,\n                                               \n18 Biervliet, Wim and Arnold Morfe, 1996. The Emerging Training Market in the Philippines. UNIDO/University of\nAmsterdam Consortium, Specialist Report No. 2, June, p. 23.\n19 Unified Technical Vocational Education and Training Program Registration and Accreditation System.", "8\nrespectively, of those of government institutions.20 Managers of private institutions tend to be\nmore  cost  conscious  and  make  more  intensive  use  of  equipment  and  facilities:  average\nutilization  reported  for  the  private  technical  schools  (74  percent  for  laboratory  use  and\n80 percent for workshops) was higher than the comparable values reported for government\ntechnical-vocational schools (44 percent for laboratories and 55 percent for workshops).21 The\nsame survey found that private schools perform better than government schools in intensive use\nof staff. About 90 percent of the private institutions had staff/student ratios above 1:12 whereas\n66 percent of the government schools had staff/student ratios below 1:12. Overall, taking both\ncosts and impact into account, private training is more cost-effective than government training.\n35. Nevertheless, enrollments in the private TESD system have been declining. Between\n1996 and 1997, enrollment in private technical vocational schools reportedly fell by 21 percent.\nThe regulatory environment does not appear to be the issue; private training providers in the\nPhilippines generally find TESDA regulation appropriate.22 One constraint is the private TESD\nproviders\u2019  lack  of  access  of  to  credit.  Very  few  commercial  sources  give  private  schools\nfinancing to improve the quality of their programs. Private providers, especially small schools,\noften do not have the collateral required by commercial lenders.\n36. Another  constraint  is  unfair  competition  from  the  heavily  subsidized  SUCs.  These\ninstitutions  have  been  introducing  courses  already  available  in  private  institutions and are\nattracting potential students with their low fees.\nd. Inequitable Access\n37. The TESD system enrolls a large share of students from poor households. One study\nfound that three fourths of the students in TESD came from low-income families.23  More recent\nobservations found the range of students from poor backgrounds to be 60-90 percent (Appendix\nB). Skills development is an important means for disadvantaged people to improve their income\nand quality of life. However, three sets of barriers impede upward mobility: financial barriers,\ngeographic and gender barriers, and structural impediments.\n38. First, lack of finance limits access to TESD programs for a large number of the poor.\nEven  with  the  currently  low  tuition  fees  in  public  institutions,  poor  families  without  stable\nemployment and with incomes below the poverty line have difficulty in supporting their children\nattending TESD institutions. The situation is more difficult when the poorer children attend\nprivate institutions that charge student fees higher than those in public schools. Although the\nGovernment provides scholarships for private TESD schools, only a relatively small percentage\n(about 3 percent) of students receive financial assistance. The Private Education Student Fund\nAssistance  (PESFA)  scholarships  for  disadvantaged  students  is  administered  by  TESDA\nthrough  its  regional  and  provincial  offices.  Allocations  are  made  to  provinces  by  TESDA\naccording to a formula that takes into account poverty incidence in the area. More than 10,700\nscholarships were awarded in school year (SY) 1999, and the number increased to 13,500 in\n                                               \n20 Gray, L. 1996 op. cit. p. 26.\n21 Ibid., p. 4.\n22For example, tuition fee ceilings apply only to students enrolled in the second year of courses. Institutions are free\nto establish fee levels for new courses and for  new  cohorts  entering  existing  courses.  Moreover,  TESDA\naccreditation and occupational standards are generally welcomed as improving the standards in the industry.\n23 Vergara and Valisno (1985) as quoted in Doctor, R. M. 1995. The Role of Private Technical and Vocational\nEducation and Training Institutions in the Philippines. Technical Vocational Education and Training Sector Studies\nSeries, TESDA, p. 240.", "9\nSY2000. These scholarships are held by students, subject to satisfactory performance, for two\nyears of study at an institution of the student\u2019s choosing. PESFA scholarships thus function\nmuch like vouchers and reportedly work well. PESFA is an important way to provide indirect\npublic support to private institutions that will achieve both equity and efficiency objectives.\n39. Second, other barriers are a limited geographic distribution of TESD institutions and\ngender biases. Most (86 percent) TESD institutions are in urban areas, limiting the access of\nrural populations that constitute the majority in the Philippines. Enrollments in postsecondary\nnondegree courses in the National Capital Region account for 42 percent of the total student\npopulation; enrollment in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao is 0.23 percent of the\nnational total.24 Rural parents who send their children to the cities to attend TESD incur extra\ncosts. In terms of gender participation, about 40 percent of the enrollees in TESD institutions\nare women. This figure is higher than that in most countries worldwide and in the region, but is\nstill less than parity. Most women tend to concentrate in traditional programs such as sewing,\narts and crafts, and food services, which usually lead to low-paying jobs. Far fewer women take\nthe national trade tests after completion of their studies (7,400 women in the first half of 1998,\ncompared with 26,700 men). Only about 33 percent  of  the  women passed the  trade  test\n(compared with 39 percent of the men.) In part the problem rests with gender segmentation in\nthe  labor  market,  which  perpetuates  unequal  incomes  for  women  in  the  job  market  (see\nAppendix B).\n40. Third,  disadvantaged  students  who  do  attend  TESD  institutions  are  discriminated\nagainst through lack of opportunities for further advancement in the education system. TESD\nsuffers a poor image and is perceived as a dead-end and last-choice option among many\nparents and students. This aversion has deep historical roots and was reinforced by the former\nnational college entrance examination. If one failed the examination, the only avenue left was\nTESD. The poor reputation is reinforced by the lack of transferability of credits from TESD\nprograms to further studies elsewhere. Since the majority of students in TESD come from poor\nfamilies with incomes near or below the poverty line, they lack opportunities for further studies.\nA well-developed equivalency  system for  TESD programs  similar  to  the  Accreditation and\nEquivalency system established under the ADB-financed Nonformal Education Project25 will\nhelp TESD students transfer from one program to another or transfer credits earned from one\nschool to another. In addition, it will provide a means for people who have acquired technical\nknowledge  and  skills  through  work  and  experience  outside  the  TESD  system  to  obtain\ncertification  and  accreditation  through  skills  testing  for  further  TESD  training  and  career\nadvancement. This kind of equivalence is especially important for children from poorer families\nparticularly those who do not finish high school and hence would not normally qualify for\nentrance to TESDA programs. Establishment of equivalency programs will make TESD more\nattractive  and  open  TESD  institutions  to  the  poor  and  those  who  want  to  improve  their\nlivelihood.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n41. The proposed Project will assist the Government in implementing the main elements of\nits medium-term strategy for skills development. The government policy is to promote economic\ngrowth and improve social equity so as to reduce poverty and promote social harmony. The\ngoal of development as articulated in the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP)\n                                               \n24 TESDA 1997.

The present administration\u2019s priority\nprograms include (i) modernizing agriculture; (ii) delivering basic social development services;\n(iii)  developing  infrastructure,  especially  in  the  rural  areas;  (iv)  enhancing  global\ncompetitiveness, (v) maintaining macroeconomic stability; and (vi) strengthening partnerships\namong  national  and  local  governments,  the  business  community,  and  civil  society  by\nmaintaining peace and order.26\n42. These priorities have important implications for skills development. To accelerate rural\ndevelopment and reduce poverty, the MTPDP calls for (i) devolution of the management of\ntraining  institutions  to  local  governments;  (ii)  directly  channeling  funding  assistance  for\ndeserving poor students; and (iii) institutionalizing a system of recognition, accreditation, and\nequivalency of work experience and prior learning so that more persons can take advantage of\nand profit from skills development. Improving skills development for competitiveness calls for\n(i) accelerating the delivery and implementation of flexible, market-oriented, and user-driven\ntraining systems in priority disciplines and programs; and (ii) promoting increased private sector\nparticipation in financing, managing, and delivering middle-level skills development.27\n43. The  MTPDP  also  advocates  specific  activities  to  accomplish  the  following  goals:\nimproving the effectiveness and efficiency of the system by\n(i)  improving the relevance and quality of skills development;\n(ii)  implementing the Unified Technical Vocational Education and Training\nProgram Registration System;\n(iii)  implementing  programs  for  critical  middle-level  skills  requirements  of\npriority sectors in identified growth areas;\n(iv)  implementing and expanding the dual training system;28\n(v)  identifying and establishing centers of excellence;\n(vi)  upgrading physical facilities, equipment and instructional materials;\n(vii)  intensifying competency-based training;\n(viii)  intensifying training of trainers;\n(ix)  identifying best practices for community-based training and introducing\nentrepreneurship development; and\n(x)  institutionalizing and expanding the  TESDA Occupational Qualification\nand Certification System; and\nimproving the participation of disadvantaged groups in skills development by\n(i) directly channeling funding assistance to deserving students to raise their\npurchasing power in choosing programs and schools;\n(ii) establishing an equivalency system skills development; and\n(iii) developing  and  testing  nonconventional  alternative  delivery  systems,\nsuch as distance learning.\n                                               \n26 Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan, 1999-2004.\n27 Ibid., pp. 2-45.\n28 The dual training system combines practical on-the-job training in business premises and classroom studies in\nTESD schools.", "11\n44. The National Technical Education and Skills Development Plan (NTESDP) was drafted\nin 1999 in consonance with the MTPDP. The NTESDP translates the policy thrusts of the\nMTPDP into strategies and means to address the critical skills requirements of the country in\nthe medium term. It pursues a three-pronged strategy.\n(i)  Improve global competitiveness by addressing the skills requirements of export-\noriented  activities,  catalytic  industries,  industries  undergoing  adjustments,\nsupport industries, and overseas employment.\n(ii)  Accelerate  rural  development  and  poverty  reduction\u2014mainstream  the\ncountryside in national development by addressing the skills requirements of\neconomic activities in the rural areas, especially in pursuing technology-based\nagriculture and fishery development.\n(iii)  Strengthen social integration by focusing on the development of paraprofessional\nand other social workers to facilitate the delivery of and access to social services,\nproviding the poor and disadvantaged with a wider access to the opportunity to\ndevelop the needed social and personal skills.29\n45. The NTESDP presents seven policies for the continued overall reform and improvement\nof skills development.30\n(i)  Upgrade  the  quality  and  raise  the  productivity  of  Philippine  middle-level\nmanpower to be globally competitive by, among others, better instruction for\ncompetencies and certification.\n(ii)  Rationalize the roles and functions of TESDA in overseeing skills development,\nin part through policy development, monitoring and information systems, and\nresearch and advocacy.\n(iii)  Maximize the role of industry and private providers by, among others, promoting\nthe dual system and providing incentives for private providers.\n(iv)  Use skills development to promote rural development by supporting targeted\nservices through LGUs.\n(v)  Elevate  the  prestige  of  middle-level  skills  as  occupations  through  social\nmarketing, guidance, disseminating labor  market  information, and developing\nequivalence programs.\n(vi)  Devolve  training  responsibilities  to  LGUs  by  building  local  managerial  and\ntechnical capabilities.\n(vii)  Emphasize the development of entrepreneurship in all skills training.\nThese major policies have been consolidated into an action plan of specific programs. TESDA\nhas identified specific responsibilities, a financing plan, and implementation schedules to carry\nout  between  1999  and  2004  the  tasks  that  involve  TESDA  headquarters,  regional,  and\nprovincial offices, executive and legislative branches of the Government, LGUs, and NGOs.\nC.

The Japan\nInternational  Cooperation  Agency  financed  the  establishment  of  the  National  Vocational\nTraining and Development Center for Women.\n47. ADB involvement in the TESD subsector included two projects prior to the inception of\nTESDA. The Technical and Vocational Education Project,32 implemented from 1982 to 1988,\nwas  a  response  to  the  Government\u2019s  concern  over  the  shortage  of  qualified  middle-level\ntechnicians. The Project aimed to improve the quality of the technical-vocational education\ndelivery  system  by  strengthening  planning  and  management  of  the  subsector,  promoting\nresearch  and  curriculum  development,  instituting  in-service  training  for  teaching  and\nnonteaching staff, and enabling 22 public technical education institutions under DECS to deliver\nimproved training courses for technicians. Lessons from this project are presented in paras. 51\nand 52.\n48. The Agricultural Technology Education Project33 was implemented from 1988 to 1994.\nThe  project  institutions  were  agricultural  schools/colleges  under  DECS.  The  Project  was\ndesigned to support the Government\u2019s effort to establish the National Agricultural Education\nSystem by (i) strengthening 13 provincial technical institutes of agriculture and higher level\ninstitutions; (ii) strengthening sector management including the institutionalization of a benefit\nmonitoring  system  and  industry  liaison-guidance  counseling  services;  and  (iii) institutional\nrestructuring of the various teaching institutions. The project also supported the establishment of\nfarmer training centers for informal short-course training. The  lessons  arising are given  in\npara. 53.\n49. In addition, the World Bank-financed Second Vocational Training Project, approved in\nJune  1992  and  completed  on  31  December  1999,  financed  four  programs:  institutional\ndevelopment, improving training quality, developing training capacity, and studies and research\nin  TESD.  In  addition,  an  integrated  computer-based  information  system  in  the  National\nManpower Information System (NMIS) was established to aid TESDA in its policy formulation\ntasks  to  better  manage  the  TESD  sector.  See  para.  55  for  the  main  findings  from  the\nimplementation of the Project.\nD. Lessons Learned\n50. The proposed Project takes into account the lessons of previous investments to support\nskills development in the Philippines (Appendix 2).\n51. A reevaluation of ADB\u2019s Technical and Vocational Education Project34 found that it partly\nsucceeded in attaining its objectives. It contributed to improving the delivery system of the\ntechnician program, which increased the qualifications of student output above the target set at\nappraisal. But with rapid technological development, further improvements were needed. In-\nservice  training,  research,  and  curriculum  development  were  introduced  during  project\nimplementation, but only in-service training has been sustained at the national center.

For future ADB interventions in the subsector, the reevaluation concludes that sufficient\nsupport should be given to the private providers of TESD, which enrolls 80 percent of the\nstudents in this sector. Further, the terms and conditions of support (i.e., provision of loan funds)\nshould be realistic, flexible, and free from stringent administrative requirements to allow the\nprivate institutions to meet the requirements of the market more effectively. The study also\ncautions against the tendency of assisted schools to broaden their scope and programs and\nconcentrate on higher-level courses in an effort to become part of the SUC network, with a\nconsequent loss of focus on TESD to prepare skilled workers.\n53. A postevaluation of ADB\u2019s Agricultural Technology Education Project35 in 1999 found\nthat the project outputs were established as planned, with two major exceptions: the benefit\nmonitoring system was not institutionalized but done as an ad hoc study, and the administrative\nsystem  was  not fully  restructured due  to  the objections  raised  by  the  provincial  technical\ninstitutes of agriculture. The evaluation indicates that the Project had expanded the range of\nagriculture courses, and hence, the range of skills of the graduates. However, no data are\navailable to clearly show employment results or the fit of the skills of the new type of graduates\nto the demand of the job market. At the institution level, many facilities and capabilities were\nenhanced, yet management weaknesses with respect to maintenance of facilities persist, and\nthe objective of improving self-financing by the schools was not met. Because of the mixed\nresults and  concerns about  the  sustainability of  the benefits,  the  project  was  rated  partly\nsuccessful.\n54. To improve the planning and management of the TESD system, it was pointed out that it\nis very important to regularly gather and evaluate information concerning market demands for\ntypes of skills and programs that enable resources to be used effectively. The design of TESD\nprojects should be based on realistic assessments of the aspirations of the intended students,\nthe constraints of the industry to which the training is targeted, and the overall education\nsystem. As for financial assistance to the students, living expenses are a major cost item. For\nscholarships to be effective in opening up access to low-income families, they must contribute\nsubstantially to living expenses.\n55. The main findings from the implementation of the World Bank\u2019s Second Vocational\nTraining Project36 were that (i) the project design was overly complex and led to delays; (ii) too\nmany activities ran in parallel with ongoing TESDA programs, thereby straining the staff and\ncausing delays; (iii) more attention should have been paid to measurement and assessment of\noutcomes including the benefits of training programs; (iv) there was no acceptance of skills\ncertification of workers, curricula, and teaching materials; and (v) the project had no impact on\nprivate service providers. On the positive side, the project experienced several successes,\nincluding  the  initial  development  of  a  manpower  information  system,  locally  generated\ncommunity-based training programs, in-plant training of trainers, and initial development of\nTESDA staff in policy and research activities. The review concluded that \u201cTESDA has acquired\nthe technical capacity to efficiently implement sector investments while assuring the quality and\n                                               \n35 PPA: PHI 15073: Agricultural Technology Education Project, February 1999.\n36 World Bank, Philippines: Second Vocational Training Project (Credit 2392-PH)\u2014Implementation Completion\nReport, 15 March 2000.", "14\nrelevance of its programs. TESDA has proven to be an effective implementation agency with\nstrong leadership and committed staff at all levels.\u201d37\nE. ADB Strategy\n56. The proposed Project is consistent with both ADB\u2019s strategy for the Philippines and\npolicies for the education and training sector.\n57. ADB\u2019s  assistance  program  to  the  Philippines  increases  the  emphasis  on  poverty\nreduction  and  social  development.  In  particular,  the  program  concentrates  on  promoting\nequitable growth, better provision of basic social services like health care and basic education,\nand  improved  management  and  protection  of  the  environment.  The  Country  Operational\nStrategy further recommends that ADB extend investment support to improving the standard\nand coverage of technical and scientific education at the postsecondary level to ensure that an\ninadequate supply of technically and scientifically trained labor does not pose a constraint on\nindustrial growth, especially in skill-intensive sectors. It adds that these interventions would be\nespecially valuable, given that less than 6 percent of the labor force in the country currently\nhave appropriate technical skills.\n58. The  focus  on  poverty  reduction  and  social  development  directly  supports  ADB\u2019s\noverarching goal of poverty reduction. ADB\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy38 emphasizes the\nimportance of access to basic education and primary health services. The paper emphasizes\nthat, among other things, ADB will provide strong and innovative support to expand access to\nquality basic and nonformal education and skills development, particularly for women, girls, and\nothers excluded for social and geographic reasons.\n59. In line with ADB\u2019s objective of poverty reduction, the ongoing Nonformal Education\nProject (footnote 25) has directly and significantly contributed to poverty reduction through\nliteracy and livelihood programs and the introduction of an accreditation and equivalency system\nto  benefit  the  poor,  especially  out-of-school  youth  and  adults,  and  disadvantaged  groups\nthroughout the Philippines. The project demonstrates ADB\u2019s dedication in providing the poor\nwith opportunities to acquire literacy and livelihood skills, as well as elementary and secondary\neducation qualifications through innovative approaches.\n60. ADB\u2019s draft education policy paper39 recognizes the importance of skills development in\nthe context of economic development. Maintaining competitiveness and improving productivity\nin an era of globalization and diminishing trade barriers demand that the skills of the workforce\nbe  continually  upgraded.  The  paper  points  out,  however,  that  government-financed  skills\ntraining  programs  are  often  supply-driven,  are  delivered  at  higher  unit  cost  than  similar\nprograms provided by the private sector, and are often in direct competition with the private\nsector.  ADB  support  for  skills  development  should  therefore  concentrate  on  (i) upgrading\ngovernment capacity to coordinate (but not to provide) skills training and to establish and\nmonitor  skills  standards;  (ii)  encouraging  private  sector  provision  of  training  by  helping\ngovernments  establish  conducive  policy  environments  and  incentives;  and  (iii)  helping  to\nestablish skills development funds that can be used by agencies such as NGOs to provide skills\ntraining for the poor, especially women.\n                                               \n37 Ibid., pp. 8, 9.\n38 R179-99:Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific.

It\nfurther highlights the need to rationalize the management of the TESD system, accelerate\nimplementation of quality assurance programs, support  the  role of  the  private  sector, and\nimplement  measures  to  improve  the  access  of  the  poor  to  skills  training.  During  project\nappraisal,  understanding  was  reached  with  the Government for  the  implementation  of  the\nfollowing specific measures to strengthen the TESD system.\n(i)  Rationalizing the role and functions of TESDA. The role, functions, and capacity\nof TESDA as an oversight agency will be rationalized and strengthened by the\nend of the Project to enable it to focus on sector development, quality assurance,\nmonitoring,  supervision,  and  assessment  of  the  effectiveness  of  the  TESD\nsystem as a whole.\n(ii)  Devolving public TESD institutions. In line with the provision of the TESDA Act,\nTESDA will formulate strategies and develop a comprehensive implementation\nplan to devolve the 25 public schools and 45 provincial training centers to LGUs,\nother government agencies, NGOs, and the communities.\n(iii)  Institutionalizing  and  expanding  TESD  quality  assurance  system.  Quality\nassurance programs will be institutionalized and expanded to include a minimum\ntarget of 240 private and 25 public TESD institutions during the life of the Project.\n(iv)  Developing and implementing TESD equivalency system. A TESD equivalency\nsystem similar to the Accreditation and Equivalency System established under\nthe Nonformal Education Project will be developed and implemented nationwide\nby December 2003 to allow greater transferability of work experience, skills,\ncredits, and certification between formal and nonformal TESD programs and\nbetween TESD institutions and other types of institutions.\n(v)  Supporting private providers of TESD programs. To encourage private providers\nof  TESD  to  improve  the  quality  of  their  programs  and  to  recognize  their\ncontributions, measures such as quality assurance programs, staff development\nprograms, financing facility, and student scholarships will be implemented.\nThese  measures  and  mechanisms  will  assist  the  Government  in  addressing  the  more\nimmediate issues facing the TESD system. However, several issues are beyond the scope of\nthis Project and will be addressed through a planned sector development program based on the\nPESS and the recently submitted report from the Presidential Commission on Educational\nReform.  Project  preparatory  TA  for  the  sector  development  program  will  support  the\nimplementation of the key recommendations of the Presidential Commission. Several of these\nmeasures seek fair competition between public and private institutions.40\n                                               \n40The Presidential Commission on Educational Reform recommended, among others, freezing public subsidies for\nSUCs and then progressively reducing them over five years. This would result in greater resource mobilization by\nSUCs, including increased tuition fees. It also recommended the establishment of a Coordinating Council on\nEducation where matters such as TESDA\u2019s span of supervisory authority, e.g., over SUCs, can be tabled and\naddressed.", "16\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA. Rationale\n62. The Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan emphasizes \u201ceconomic growth with\nsocial equity\u201d and the role of the private sector in improving industrial productivity to compete in\nthe global economy. This policy calls for the development of a highly skilled workforce. To meet\nthese requirements, the TESD system, as the main provider of technicians and skilled workers,\nmust  be  responsive  to  rapidly  changing  technology  and  the  demands  of  industry.  TESD\nprograms must be flexible, industry-oriented, and demand-driven. The present TESD system\nwith its supply-driven orientation, outdated curricula, poor facilities, and inadequate teaching\nequipment cannot effectively produce the skilled workforce required by the economy. Promoting\n\u201csocial  equity\u201d  requires  that  the  poor  have  wider  access  to  services,  including  better\nopportunities for skills training and employment with necessary support. For these goals to be\nrealized, it is first necessary to rationalize the system of skills development. Rationalization in\nthis context means to enable the principal parts of the system\u2014public/private, central/local\u2014to\nplay  their  appropriate  roles  and  maximize  the  overall  effectiveness  of  the  system.\nRationalization of the skills development system has three principal elements: strengthening the\ncentral agency to lead, oversee and coordinate skills training throughout the country; devolving\nthe operation of training institutions from the center to the localities; and removing constraints\nthat impede private skills training. The Project seeks to rationalize the overall system through\nthese three means, and to build social equity in skills acquisition.\n63. The Project\n(i)  responds to the basic requirements of improved competitiveness and equity;\n(ii)  addresses key weaknesses in the present system of skills development;\n(iii)  supports the implementation of a comprehensive and well-documented plan for\nskills development in the Philippines;\n(iv)  takes into account lessons learned from previous assistance to the subsector;\nand\n(v)  is consistent with ADB\u2019s country strategy and education policies.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n64. The overall aim of the Project is to enhance competitiveness for the Philippines through\ngreater relevance and quality in skills development. The secondary objective is to contribute to\npoverty  reduction.  The  Project  has  four  specific  objectives:  (i)  to  rationalize  the  role  and\nstrengthen  the  capacity  of  TESDA,  (ii)  to  devolve  TESDA\u2019s  responsibilities  for  training\ninstitutions to LGUs or NGOs, (iii) to strengthen the capacity of private providers of TESD, and\n(iv) to enhance equity in skills acquisition.\n1.  Strengthening TESDA\n65. In the context of skills training, the role of the Government should be able to perform key\nfunctions  that  cannot  be,  or  are  not,  done  by  the  private  sector.  This  includes  policy\ndevelopment, establishment of standards, assessment of the system and its outputs, curriculum\nand teacher development, and research and financing of innovations to improve the quality of\nTESD. The Philippines is fortunate to have a single, integrated authority, TESDA, in charge of\nthese functions for all middle-level skills development.", "17\n66. The first objective of the Project is to focus and strengthen the work of TESDA as the\nmain  coordinating  agency  for  skills  development  in  the  Philippines.  This  objective  will  be\naccomplished by institutionalizing TESDA\u2019s quality assurance programs, and by strengthening\ncapacity and resources within TESDA.\na.  Institutionalizing Quality Assurance Programs\n67. The  1998  PESS  found  that  skills  training  was  basically  on  the  right  track  in  the\nPhilippines under the direction of TESDA. One reason was TESDA\u2019s well-conceived quality\nassurance system, which seeks to improve the quality of TESD programs. However, additional\nassistance is needed to institutionalize the proposed programs and to expand their coverage\nnationwide. The first program pertains to registration and accreditation of training, both in the\npublic and private sectors. Under the Project, assistance will be provided for the expansion of\nthe registration, assessment, and accreditation of TESD institutions nationwide. Initially the\nProject targets 240 private institutions and the 25 public institutions. The second aspect of\nquality assurance is occupational standards and certification, an area where the Philippines has\nsound  experience  on  which  to  build.  TESDA  will  be  assisted  to  expand  the  system  by\ndeveloping  additional  standards  and  a  qualification  framework.  In  particular,  50  skills\nassessment centers will be established within existing TESD institutions throughout the country.\nThe centers will be equipped and, in some cases, facilities will be renovated. In addition,\npersonnel of the centers will receive training in skills testing and assessing the quality of TESD\nprograms.\n68. An  equivalency  and  certification  system  will  be  implemented  and  expanded  in  the\ndesignated  skills  assessment  centers.  The  system  will  give  qualifying  credits  and  issue\ncertificates  to  students,  trainees,  and  other  persons  who  pass  the  examinations  and\nassessments. In addition to providing credits and recognition to skills and experience acquired\noutside  formal  TESD  programs,  the  equivalency  system  will  provide  further  learning\nopportunities for those who have acquired other forms of prior learning. TESDA and the Bureau\nof Nonformal Education under DECS have signed a Memorandum of Understanding to allow\nholders of secondary certificates obtained through the accreditation and equivalency system,\nimplemented under the ADB-financed Nonformal Education Project (footnote 25) to enroll in\nTESD programs and acquire technical qualifications for career development. A similar system\nwill be developed under the Project for trainees and workers to obtain skills certification and\nqualification for further education and career advancement. Social marketing abilities will be\nlaunched to increase social acceptability of MLSD programs.\nb. Strengthening the Role and Capacity of TESDA\n69. TESDA plays a central role in overall skills development, but some of its functions are\nnot well-developed and need to be strengthened. Among these functions are its management\ninformation  system,  research,  curricula  and  course  development  capacity,  and  distance\nteaching.\n70. First, the Project will provide consulting services for an overall institutional assessment\nof TESDA with a view to rationalizing its management structure and functions. The principle\nunderlying this analysis will be to devolve functions as far as possible and rationalize TESDA\u2019s\nfunctions along the four legally mandated functions: (i) development planning, (ii) standard\nsetting, (iii) resource allocation, and (iv) policy formulation. Appendix 3 gives the terms of\nreference for the institutional analysis.", "18\n71. Second,  the  Project  will  support  the  training  of  national  and  local  TESDA  staff  in\nresearch, policy analysis, planning, management, and monitoring and evaluation to enable them\nto better carry out TESDA\u2019s mandate as an oversight agency. In view of the key role of TESDA\nin disseminating information on skills demands in the market as well as training providers, the\nProject will boost the research capacity of TESDA to conduct key policy analyses, project\ndevelopment, and to propose policy directives.\n72. Third,  the  Project  provides  support  for  further  development  of  the  educational\nmanagement information system (EMIS). Progress was made under the World Bank-financed\nSecond Vocational Training Project to develop a national manpower information system (NMIS),\nbut  additional  work\u2014accelerating  hardware  and  software  development,  training  staff,  and\nextending the network to regional and provincial levels\u2014is needed to enhance its capacity.\n73. Fourth, TESDA\u2019s capacity to provide relevant and high-quality courseware to training\ninstitutions will be increased. Courseware, instructional packages, and teachers\u2019 handbooks and\nguides will be procured or developed in priority areas such as information and communication\ntechnology, engineering technology, production technology, and electronics. The materials will\nbe available for purchase by public and private institutions. Staff development programs will also\nbe offered to teachers of both private and public schools to upgrade their knowledge and skills\nin courseware design and development and the teaching skills required to effectively implement\nthe new packages in the schools. Details of the staff development programs are in Appendix C.\nThe  first  priority  will  be  to  buy  off-the-shelf  existing  courses  that  have  proved  effective\nelsewhere. In this regard, TESDA will contribute an important screening and evaluation function\nto the selection of materials.\n74. Fifth, TESDA\u2019s capacity to develop and deliver distance teaching will be supported as a\nmeans, initially, to achieve cost-effective delivery of teacher training programs. A distance\neducation  program  for  teachers  will  be  developed  and  pilot-tested  in  five  of  the  project\ninstitutions across the country. The experimental centers, supported by the regional centers, will\nmake  skills  training  programs  available  to  a  wider  population.  Instructional  modules  and\npackages will be developed through the use of multimedia, print, and nonprint materials, to be\nused first for training of trainers and teacher upgrading programs. Subsequently, the trainers\nand teachers trained will introduce skills training programs through distance delivery of courses\nand modules, leading to trade qualification upgrading and skills testing. It is envisaged that any\nmedia work involved will be contracted out on a commercial basis rather than building the\ncapacity within TESDA.\n2.  Devolving Training Functions to LGUs and NGOs\n75. A corollary of strengthening the central functions of TESDA is for TESDA to devolve its\ndirect training responsibilities to LGUs, communities, institutions, and NGOs. At present, TESDA\nstill administers 58 technical, vocational, and agricultural schools and 45 provincial training\ncenters through its regional and provincial offices. The devolution of responsibilities for these\ntraining institutions from the center to the local levels is expected to realize several benefits.\nFirst, training programs can be linked better to the needs of local enterprises. Second, training\ninstitutions can become more self-financing. In short, locally controlled training institutions will\nhave to be more responsible for finding their own markets and financing. The Project, therefore,\nsupports implementation of the policy of devolving the training function from TESDA to LGUs\nand other institutions, NGOs, or foundations. Consulting services will be provided to assist\nTESDA in the formulation of strategies and plans for devolution. In addition, the Project will\nprovide resources to (i) strengthen the management capacity of local staff who will be involved", "19\nin the devolution process, and (ii) upgrade the facilities of the project public institutions in\npreparation for devolution.\na.  Developing the Management and Staff of Local Institutions\n76. One of the main requirements for successful devolution is to prepare the management\nand  staff of  local  organizations,  and of  the  training  institutions  themselves,  to  accept  the\nadditional responsibilities. The Project provides assistance to empower and equip personnel at\nthe local and school levels to manage and supervise TESD programs that are responsive to\nlocal needs. Administrators, key school officials, and LGU personnel who will be involved in the\ndevolution process and responsible for planning, managing, and supervising TESD institutions\nand programs at the local and school levels will undergo training to be organized under the\nProject.  The  staff  development  programs  for  this  subcomponent  emphasize  planning,\nmanagement,  supervision,  and  assessment  of  TESD  institutions.  LGU  personnel  will  be\nselected from among those who will be involved in implementing the devolution of the project\ninstitutions.  School-based  supervisory,  monitoring,  and  evaluation  systems  to  ensure\ncontinuous self-improvement will be institutionalized in the project institutions. These activities\nwill enable LGUs and the project institutions to plan and manage their skills training programs\nmore effectively.\nb.  Developing the Training Facilities\n77. Project resources will be used as incentives for the TESDA-administered institutions to\nequip and prepare themselves for the devolution process and to become more independent\nfinancially.\n78. TESDA  will  develop  devolution  plans  for  the  58  training  institutions  that  it  now\nadministers. Initially, however, 25 project institutions have been identified for support based on\nmanagement  capacity,  location  in  the  growth  centers,  existing  programs  and  resources,\npotential development, and the needs of the communities. The 25 institutions will be upgraded\nto become \u201ccenters of excellence\u201d in specified fields (Appendix 4). Support is conditional upon\nthe acceptance of the devolution plan and the agreement between TESDA and the recipient\nagency. Once a devolution plan has been agreed upon with the LGUs or other agencies, the\ngovernance and management of these centers will be strengthened to prepare for and assist\nthe  transfer  of  the  institutions.  Additional  facilities  such  as  classrooms,  workshops,  and\nlaboratories and, in some cases, buildings, equipment, and instructional materials to support\ncontextual learning in the sciences, mathematics, technology, and technical skills training will be\nprovided.  The  Project  will  finance  the  needed  civil  works,  equipment,  staff  development,\ninstructional materials, and courseware for the institutions.\n79. Currently, TESDA administers 45 small provincial training centers through its provincial\noffices. Most of the centers are in remote or rural areas and provide basic training facilities and\nopportunities to the poor rural population. Some centers were established with donations of land\nor basic facilities from the local communities or LGUs with central government support for their\noperation  and  maintenance.  The  programs  offered  generally  include  garment  making  and\nsewing, automechanics, training for electricians, and basic electronics. These centers will be\nprovided modest facilities, improvement funds, and basic training equipment and tools to enable\nthem to expand services to the poor  and  disadvantaged  clients. LGUs,  other  government\nagencies, and the communities will work closely with TESDA in preparing a development plan,\nincluding management, supervision, and financing of the activities upon the transfer of the", "20\nfacilities and resources to the LGUs and communities.  The Project  will finance necessary\nrenovations in civil works and training equipment.\n80. Each project institution will be required to prepare an institutional development and\ndevolution  plan,  including  a  reasonable  schedule  for  achieving  self-sufficiency.  Public\ninstitutions will be upgraded upon the formalization of the development and devolution plans\nwith the LGUs concerned. It is envisaged that the devolved institutions will be allowed to\nmanage their own academic and financial affairs, and retain incomes and earnings from their\nactivities and assets to support their programs. TESDA will closely cooperate with LGUs, other\ngovernment  agencies,  NGOs,  the  communities,  and  the  private  sector  in  developing  and\nimplementing the devolution plans, with a definite time frame for each project institution. With\nacceptance of the devolution plan and the readiness of the parties concerned, pilot programs for\ndevolution of the selected institutions among the 45 provincial training centers, as well as the 25\nupgraded institutions, are expected to be implemented within the life of the Project.\n3.  Strengthening the Capacity of Private TESD Providers\n81. The third objective of the Project is to enhance the quality and coverage of private skills\ntraining. Private providers supply about 80 percent of all skills training at present. This is one of\nthe clear strengths of the system because private providers tend to be more closely linked to the\njob market and save substantial public resources. However, the quality and coverage of private\nprovision are limited by lack of access to capital, which constrains the potential contribution of\nprivate providers to the sector. The Project will give private providers access to a financing\nfacility  for  quality  improvement  by  creating  the  Fund  for  Technical  Education  and  Skills\nDevelopment  (FTESD)  from  which  qualified  private  training  institutions  could  borrow.  The\nFTESD  will  be  open  to  all  private  training  institutions  on  a  competitive  basis.  Interested\ninstitutions can submit a project proposal showing the purposes for which the funds will be used\nand  justifying  those  uses  in  terms  of  improving  the  quality  of  their  TESD  programs.  The\nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines (DBP) will administer the FTESD and ensure repayment.\nThe criteria for allocating funds include, among others, relevance of the proposed program to\npriority  economic  requirements  (e.g.,  information  technology,  engineering  technology,  food\ntechnology, tourism, etc.), technical and financial feasibility, and efficiency in the proposed use\nof funds, financial soundness of the institution, and geographic location. Borrowers will be\nrequired to enter into a process of quality upgrading leading to full accreditation by TESDA.\nDetails of DBP are in Appendix 11.\n82. Minimum and maximum amounts are expected to range from $25,000 to $500,000. A\npreliminary survey of private schools shows that most subloans will be in the range of $75,000-\n$250,000. They could be used for staff development, instructional materials, equipment, and\nupgrading/expansion of physical facilities. The terms of the subloans will include, among others,\na loan amount of up to 80 percent of total project costs, grace period of 6-24 months, maximum\nterms of 10 years, and an interest rate of 11.5-14.0 percent, to be fixed in accordance with\nmarket conditions at the time of approval, and a front-end fee of 1 percent of the loan amount. In\na feasibility study conducted by DBP and TESDA in 1999, private providers expressed strong\ninterest in borrowing money from the FTESD under those conditions. More than 150 of the\nsurveyed institutions indicated a willingness and intent to apply for financing from the FTESD\nonce it is established (Appendix 5). It is expected that about 100-120 institutions will receive\nloans under the Project.", "21\n4. Enhancing Equity in Skills Acquisition\n83. One consequence of the heavy reliance on private institutions for skills development is\nthat the burden for financing the training falls on the students and trainees. Private institutions\ntypically earmark about 5 percent of tuition revenues for scholarships. Still, many potential\ntrainees cannot afford the direct costs. The fourth objective of the Project is to help reduce\npoverty through better acquisition of skills for income generation among the poor. Through the\nestablishment of a scholarship fund (SF) and a student loan fund (SLF), the Project will assist\ndisadvantaged groups to receive and complete skills training.\na.  Scholarship Fund\n84. The Project will establish an SF of $6.5 million to provide poor students with financial\nassistance  to  attend  formal  and  nonformal  skills  training  in  public  and  private  institutions\n(Appendix 6). TESDA will administer the SF and make disbursements through its depository\nbank, Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP). LBP has a wide network of branches throughout the\ncountry .\n85. TESD  students  enrolled  in  priority  fields  such  as  engineering-related  subjects,\ninformation technology, construction, tourism, foods, and agriculture in formal and nonformal\nprograms in public and private institutions\u2014and from families below the official poverty line are\neligible to apply for scholarships at the schools where they want to enroll. TESDA will allocate\nthe assistance to the provincial offices, which, in turn, will allocate it to the recipients based on\napplications from the training institutions. This is the procedure currently followed in the award\nof PESFA scholarships to poor students. The school will evaluate the eligibility of the students\nand determine the amount to be awarded to each. Scholarships will be a maximum of P14,500\nper student per year and may be applied to tuition, books and materials, and living expenses.\nThe school will decide, in consultation with the students and their parents/guardians, the priority\nneeds of the students and the allowances needed to cover their living expenses.\n86. Enrollees  in  nonformal  TESD programs  will  be given  the  scholarship  only  once  to\ncomplete the program. For formal programs that require full-time studies leading to a certificate\nor diploma below the degree level, the support may be extended after the first year until the\nstudent completes the program provided progress is satisfactory and completion is within a\nmaximum of three years. The school will be required to submit a report on student academic\nperformance to TESDA every term. Approximately 20,000 students/trainees will benefit from the\nSF. The Government will also continue to support student assistance under the PESFA program\nat least at the 1999 levels throughout the project period.\nb. Student Loan Fund\n87. Scholarship  grants  have  the  advantage  of  targeting  the  poorest  students  but  the\ndisadvantage of not being readily sustainable. Once the grant fund is exhausted, there may be\nno replenishment even though there will be a continuing demand for some form of financial\nsupport for the poorest students. In addition, while scholarship grants target the poorest, they\nare not necessarily appropriate for the needs of the borderline poor, that is, students from\nfamilies whose income is too high to qualify the students for a scholarship grant but too low to\nenable them to pursue technical or vocational studies. Scholarship grants have the advantage\nof being relatively simple to administer since repayment is not a factor, while loan funds, which\nrecycle resources, are associated with a certain amount of risk.", "22\n88. The  Government  recognizes  the  risks  (e.g.,  defaults,  targeting  efficiency,  and\nadministrative  costs),  but  is  still  concerned  with  the  high  cost  and  nonsustainability  of\nscholarship grants. To develop an equitable higher education finance system based largely on\nuser fees and cost recovery, an experimental student loan scheme will be developed under the\nproject. Loans will be available to students who come from low-income families and are enrolled\nin public and private institutions. The loan will enable such students to undertake TESD training.\nThe  loan  fund  will  be  implemented  in  such  a  way  as  to  maximize  experimentation  and\nmonitoring with the objective of carefully analyzing its efficiency and effectiveness. Based on\nmonitoring results, the implementation arrangements, eligibility criteria, repayment procedures,\netc., will be strengthened to facilitate longer term institutionalization.\n89. A Student Loan Fund (SLF) of $1.5 million will be established to support nonpoor but\nneedy  students  who  are  enrolled  in  registered  or  accredited  priority  TESD  programs  and\nspecialized short-term training leading to a certificate or diploma below degree level in private\nand public institutions. The priority programs include engineering and manufacturing-related\nsubjects, communications, information technology, electronics, tourism, agriculture and fishery,\nfoods, and maritime studies.\n90. Qualified applicants and full-time students enrolled in registered or accredited programs\nin public and private institutions who meet the income criterion are eligible to apply for an\neducational loan through their institutions. To enable as many students to benefit from the SLF,\nthe maximum loan size will be limited to P15,000 per year.\n91. Several models of student loan programs have been implemented in both developed\nand developing countries including the Philippines. To ensure the effectiveness and viability of\nthe student loan program under the Project, consulting services will assist in formulating and\nimplementing the SLF. TESDA will make the necessary arrangements acceptable to ADB for\neffective implementation of the SLF. The SLF is expected to become fully operational in the\nsecond year of the Project. It will be closely monitored and its success and impact assessed by\nADB and TESDA. If the program proves successful, the Government and ADB may expand it,\nprovided that project resources are available.\nC.  Cost Estimates\n92. The total cost of the Project to be implemented by TESDA is estimated at $70 million\nequivalent,  of  which  $27.34  million  (39.1  percent)  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost,  including  the\n$4.01 million  service  charge  on  the  proposed  loan.  The  local  currency  cost  is  estimated  at\n$42.66 million  (60.9  percent  equivalent).  A  summary  is  shown  in  Table 1,  and  details  are  in\nAppendix 7.", "23\nTable 1: Project Costs\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nComponent Exchange Currency Cost\nA. Base Cost\n1.

Financing Plan\n93. It is proposed that ADB provide (i) a loan of $25 million to the Republic of the Philippines\nfor  TESDP,  and  (ii)  a  loan  of  Y2,166,700,000  to  DBP  for  the  FTESD.  The  loan  to  the\nGovernment will finance 34.16 percent of the foreign exchange cost and 36.7 percent of local\ncurrency cost. It will have an amortization period of 25 years, including a grace period of 5\nyears, with an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending\nrate system for US dollar loans and a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum. The\nGovernment will  pay to ADB a front-end fee in an amount equal to one percent of the loan. The\nfee will be capitalized in the loan. The Government will provide a counterpart budget of $20\nmillion equivalent for local currency costs. The financing arrangements are summarized in Table\n2 and shown in detail in Appendix 7.\n94. The  ADB  loan  of  $25  million  to  the  Government  will  finance,  among  others,  the\nScholarship Fund ($6.5 million) and the Student Loan Fund  ($1.5  million),  in-country  staff\ndevelopment programs ($3.23 million) and other smaller items for which expenses are in the\nlocal currency. Hence, the ratio of local currency to foreign currency costs appears rather high,\nbut it is justified by the nature of the expenses involved.\n95. The  Government  has  obtained  parallel  cofinancing  from  Nordic  Development  Fund\n(NDF) for SDR6 million or $8 million equivalent (11.4 percent of the Project cost)41 for purchase\nof equipment and instructional materials, and from Danish International Development Agency\n                                               \n41 NDF\u2019s credit carries no interest, but has 0.75 percent service charge and 0.5 percent commitment fee with\n40 years maturity including 10 years grace period.", "24\n(DANIDA) ($10 million or 14.3 percent of the Project cost)42 for procurement of equipment and\ninstructional materials. In addition, the OPEC Fund for International Development will provide a\nloan of $7 million equivalent43 to finance 100 percent of civil works for all project institutions\nincluding upgrading of multimedia facilities at TESDA headquarters.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\u2014TESDA Loan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\n    Source Exchange Currency Cost Percent\nADB 9.34 15.66 25.00 35.7\nNordic Development Fund 8.00 0 8.00 11.4\nOPEC Fund 0 7.00 7.00 10.0\nDANIDA 10.00 0 10.00 14.3\nGovernment of the Philippines 0 20.00 20.00 28.6\nTotal 27.34 42.66 70.00 100.0\n96. The ADB loan to DBP of Y2,166,700,000 will be from the market-based loan window\nwith government guarantee to set up the FTESD for onlending to private TESD institutions. The\nloan to DBP will have an amortization period of 15 years, including a grace period of 5 years,\nand a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum. It will have a fixed interest rate for the\nfirst ten years, with an option to covert to a floating rate on the tenth year. DBP will pay to ADB a\nfront-end fee in an amount equal to one percent of the loan amount. The fee will be capitalized\nin the loan. To ensure the financial viability of the DBP loan and sound financial management, it\nis agreed that DBP will maintain a capital adequacy ratio of at least 10 percent and a minimum\nreturn on average total assets of 0.3 percent for every year of the project life.\nE.  Implementation Arrangements\n1. Executing Agencies\n97. The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) will implement the\nTESD Project. A project management office (PMO) within  TESDA  will  manage day-to-day\nactivities. The director general of TESDA will act as project director and chairperson of the\nproject advisory committee (PAC). A full-time project manager will coordinate the PMO activities\nand oversee project implementation through the TESDA regional and provincial offices. The\nexisting  central,  regional, and provincial  offices  will  act as project  implementation  units  to\nsupervise and coordinate implementation activities in their respective regions and provinces.\n98. DBP will administer the FTESD. DBP will assign a team of qualified staff at headquarters\nto  manage  the  FTESD.   Private  TESD   institutions,    with   accredited   TESD  programs   or\n                                               \n42 DANIDA\u2019s mixed credit program carries a management fee of maximum 3/8 percent (flat) and a commitment fee of\nmaximum 0.25 percent per annum on the undisbursed loan amount. Loan repayment will be made in equal,\nsemiannual installments normally starting six months after commissioning.\n43 The OPEC loan carries 2 percent interest per annum with 1 percent service charge on amounts withdrawn and\noutstanding, with 20 years maturity including a 5-year grace period.", "25\ncommitments to register their programs for accreditation purposes, can apply for a loan at any\nDBP lending outlet. DBP will use the approved criteria to evaluate the application and ensure\nfull transparency and equity in the evaluation and approval of the applications, and in use of the\nloan funds. Withdrawals in amounts of no less than the yen equivalent of $1,000,000 may be\nmade  by  DBP  on  any  of  the  following  regular  withdrawal  dates,  15  March,  15  June,  15\nSeptember, and 15 December. Withdrawals in the yen equivalent of $2,000,000 or more may be\nmade on days other than the regular withdrawal dates. Close monitoring by TESDA and DBP\nwill ensure proper use of the loan funds in accordance with the terms and conditions of the loan.\nDetails on the selection procedures and criteria, terms and conditions, and repayment scheme\nare in Appendix 5.\n2. Project Advisory Committee\n99. PAC, chaired by the director general of TESDA, will be established to provide policy\ndirection, guidance, support and monitor project activities to ensure that the Project responds\neffectively to the needs of all stakeholders. The committee will comprise representatives of\nTESDA;  Department  of  Science  and  Technology;  Commission  on  Higher  Education;\nDepartment of Budget Management, Department of Education, Culture and Sports (DECS);\nDepartment of Finance; National Economic and Development Authority; DBP; associations of\nprivate industry; NGOs; and TESD providers.\n3.  Schedule\n100. The Project will be implemented over five and a half years (Appendix 8).\n4.  Procurement of Goods and Services\n101. All ADB and OPEC Fund-financed goods and services will be procured following ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement  dated  February  1999.  International  competitive  bidding  (ICB)\nprocedures will be applied for supply contracts for goods and services estimated to cost the\nequivalent of $500,000 or more. Supply contracts for courseware, instructional and educational\nmaterials and packages with a value of less than $500,000 equivalent will follow international\nshopping (IS) procedures. Small contracts for minor items with a value less than $100,000\nequivalent may be procured by direct purchase (DP). In accordance with para. 3.09 of the\nGuidelines,  DBP  will  require  each  subborrower  of  the  FTESD  to  demonstrate  that  the\nprocurement  procedures  adopted  for  goods  and  services  as  well  as  for  goods  for  lease\ninvestments are appropriate. DBP will also require each subborrower to ensure and certify to\nADB that the goods and services to be financed by such subloans will be supplied from, and\nproduced in member countries of ADB, and purchased at a reasonable price, account being\ntaken of other relevant factors such as time of delivery, efficiency and reliability of the goods,\ntheir suitability for the subproject and the availability of maintenance facilities and spare parts,\nand, in the case of services, their quality and the competence of the parties rendering them.\nProcurement under cofinancing arrangements will follow the agreements between ADB, the\ncofinanciers, and the Government.\na.  Civil Works\n102. All civil works under the Project will be financed by a loan of $7 million equivalent from\nthe  OPEC  Fund  for  International  Development.  ADB  will  administer  the  OPEC  loan  in\naccordance with the Letter of Administration to be entered into between ADB and OPEC Fund.", "26\nAll civil works contracts for the project public institutions will be awarded on the basis of local\ncompetitive bidding under ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement.\nb.  Equipment, Vehicles, Furniture, and Instructional Materials\n103. All procurement of equipment, vehicles, furniture, courseware, instructional materials,\nand consumable materials to be funded from the proceeds of the ADB loan to the Government\nwill follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Supply contracts for goods estimated to cost the\nequivalent of $500,000 or more will be awarded on the basis of ICB. Supply contracts with a\ntotal estimated value of $500,000 or less will follow IS procedures, except for supply contracts\nwith a value of less than $100,000 equivalent, which may be procured by DP. Details of\nprocurement packages and technical specifications will be submitted for ADB approval before\nthe start of the procurement process. Indicative procurement packages are in Appendix 9.\nc.  Consulting Services\n104. The Project provides consulting services of 176 person-months: 65 international and 111\ndomestic. All consultants will be selected and engaged through a firm or as individuals in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants (Appendix 3, Table A3). The\nGovernment will provide office space, secretarial support, local transportation, and other support\nservices as necessary and appropriate.\nd.  Staff Development Programs\n105. International and in-country fellowship training programs will be provided to upgrade the\nskills, knowledge, and experience of qualified individuals who will be involved in implementing\nthe project components and activities and in the development of TESD. Staff from private TESD\ninstitutions under the Project will be included in relevant in-country training programs. Staff from\nprivate institutions will be nominated by their respective institutions to TESDA. Course fees and\nother  expenses  will  be  waived  for  these  teachers,  but  the  sponsoring  institutions  will  be\nresponsible  for  incidental  expenses  the  staff  incur  in  attending  the  training  programs.\nInternational short-term training will focus on specialized subjects related to the programs to be\nimplemented under the Project. To the extent possible, training venues will be selected from\namong qualified institutions and organizations in the regional member countries of ADB. The\nGovernment  will  follow  the  criteria  agreed  upon  with  ADB  on  the  award  of  international\nfellowships.  ADB  will  be  provided  with  a  list  of  (i)  the  nominated  candidates,  (ii)  their\nqualifications, (iii) nominated institutions and agencies, and (iv) detailed cost of the proposed\ncourses. ADB approval will be required prior to the award of international fellowships. The\nGovernment will implement a bonding arrangement to ensure that after the completion of the\ntraining program the fellowship recipients will remain in the service of the Government for a\nminimum period of twice the length of the training. Private TESD institutions shall adopt their\nappropriate policy and procedures to ensure utilization and retention of the trained staff. Details\nof the staff development programs are in Appendix C.\n5.  Accounts, Reports, and Audits\n106. The TESDA PMO will prepare quarterly reports on project implementation and submit\nthem to ADB within 30 days after each quarter. The reports will be in a format acceptable to\nADB and will indicate, among other things, the progress made against established targets,\nproblems encountered during the last quarter, steps taken and proposed to be taken to resolve", "27\nproblems,  compliance  with  loan  covenants,  and  proposed  program  of  activities  for  the\nsucceeding quarter. Within three months after the physical completion of the Project, PMO will\nsubmit  to  ADB  a  project  completion  report  providing  details  of  project  implementation,\naccomplishments, benefits, and impact.\n107. Separate records and accounts for the Project will be maintained in accordance with\nsound accounting principles. They will specify the expenditures for all activities and identify all\nexpenditures to be financed out of the proceeds of the loan. Project accounts, including financial\nstatements, statement of expenditures, and imprest account records, will be audited annually by\nauditors acceptable to ADB. The auditors\u2019 report and copies of the certified accounts and\nrelated financial statements, including the auditors\u2019 opinion on the use of loan proceeds, on\ncompliance with loan covenants, and on the use of the imprest account under ADB\u2019s statement\nof expenditures procedures, will be submitted to ADB in English not later than six months after\nthe end of the fiscal year to which they relate.\n108. Borrowers  from  the  FTESD  will  submit  progress  reports  on  their  project  to  DBP\nsemiannually. For its part, DBP will submit to ADB semiannual reports on the status of the\nimplementation of the FTESD.\n6.  Disbursement\n109. All disbursements under the ADB loan will follow ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook.\nTo expedite disbursements, after loan effectiveness the Government will establish an imprest\naccount through TESDA at Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas. The imprest account, with a ceiling of\n$1.5 million, will be utilized for eligible expenditures for equipment and materials financed under\nthe  Project,  the  SF,  and  the  SLF.  The  imprest  account  will  be  established,  managed,\nreplenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook dated\nJune  1996 and detailed  arrangements agreed  upon between  the  Borrower and  ADB.  For\nsmaller expenditures, the statement of expenditures procedures will be used. Any individual\npayment to be reimbursed or liquidated under the statement of expenditure procedures will not\nexceed $20,000 or any other amount as may be agreed upon subsequently by the Government\nand ADB. The SF and SLF will be used to provide funds to be deposited with the Land Bank of\nthe Philippines for disbursement to the scholars and the schools upon instructions from TESDA.\nThe imprest account and statement of expenditures are audited as part of the annual audit in\naccordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement and ADB\u2019s Financial Reporting and\nAuditing of Projects. A separate auditor\u2019s opinion on the use of the imprest accounts and\nstatements of expenditures should be included in the annual audit report.\n7.  Project Performance\na.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n110. A wide range of indicators have been identified as part of the project framework to serve\nas criteria for evaluating the success and impact of the Project. They include the passing rate in\nthe national skills standard certification examinations of students in project institutions, job\nplacement of graduates, number of students/applicants going through the equivalency system,\nnumber of TESD programs and institutions accredited, provision of better training opportunities\nfor the poor and access to the TESD programs, and number of trainees assisted. The indicators\nwill form part of the benefit and monitoring system, which is a component of the overall project\nperformance management system.", "28\n111. Monitoring and evaluation of the Project will review the timeliness and quality of project\ninputs delivered, the process by which the project institutions translate the project inputs into\nimprovements in the teaching-learning process, student learning outcomes, and the process of\nenhancing management and supervisory capacity and practices at the local and school levels.\n112. Baseline data for all project institutions will be collected in the first year of the Project to\nform part of the TESD EMIS at the central and local levels. Standard monitoring forms for\nTESDA and the project institutions will be developed and used as instruments for assessing\nproject progress and achievements.\n113. The success of the FTESD will be determined by the number and amount of loans\nextended to private institutions, the utilization rate, the benefits to students, and the rate of\nrepayments of the loans.\nb.  Periodic Review and Midterm Review\n114. ADB will closely monitor progress through a review of the quarterly progress reports and\nregular review missions. In addition, a comprehensive midterm review will be undertaken by the\nGovernment and ADB upon completion of the third year of the Project, or at any other time as\nmay  be  agreed  upon  by  the  Government  and  ADB,  to  assess  project  progress  and\nachievements compared with its objectives and targets, identify any difficulties encountered,\nand recommend remedial measures.\n115. Particular emphasis will be placed on the successful implementation by TESDA and\nDBP and acceptance by private and public TESD training institutions, industries and the public\nof a number of initiatives such as assessment and accreditation of programs delivered by\nprivate  institutions,  scholarship  fund,  student  loan  fund,  the  loan  facility  for  private  TESD\ninstitutions, industry participation initiatives, and curricula and training  of  trainers programs\nmade available to private TESD institutions.\nF. The Executing Agencies\n116. The Technical Education Skills Development Authority will be the Executing Agency\n(EA) for the TESD Project. Development Bank of the Philippines will be the EA for the FTESD.\n117. TESDA, although relatively new as a government agency, has experienced staff who\ntransferred from the Bureau of Technical and Vocational Education under DECS, National\nManpower and Youth Council, and Department of Labor and Employment. Some staff have\nexperience  in  implementing  foreign-assisted  projects.  The  recently  completed  World  Bank\nSecond  Vocational  Training  Project has  proven  TESDA to  be  an effective  implementation\nagency with strong leadership and committed staff at all levels. Overall, it has the capacity and\nqualified staff to implement the TESD Project.\n118. As a major development finance institution, DBP has wide experience in administering\nsimilar funds for the social sector. It has administered loans under the Social Security System of\nthe Philippines for the benefit of private schools. It also manages other financing facilities for the", "29\nprivate sector. DBP has implemented three ADB-financed project44 and will assign a team of\nqualified and experienced staff to manage the FTESD. A postevaluation of the third project\ncompleted in 1999 found that DBP had exhibited strong financial performance and adhered to\nprudential financial management practices.45 DBP also has an extensive network of branches to\ncater to the needs of private schools in the provinces.\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environment\n119. The environmental implications of the Project were reviewed and no significant adverse\nenvironmental impacts were identified. The Project has been classified under environmental\ncategory C. TESDA will ensure that the upgrading, expansion, renovation and operation of the\nschool facilities under  the  Project  will follow ADB\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected\nInfrastructure  Development  Projects  and  relevant  environmental  procedures.  Standard\noperation  procedures  for  the  use  and  discharge  of  chemical  substances  in  the  schools\u2019\nlaboratories will be developed to prevent adverse environmental impacts. All new curricula will\nbe identified and reviewed to ensure the proper incorporation of environmental management\nconcerns.\n2.  Initial Social Analysis\n120. The Project was designed to address social issues in three major areas. First, it will help\nincrease  equity  and  access  to  TESD  institutions  and  programs  among  the  poor  through\nexpanded training opportunities especially in the rural areas, and provision of training programs\nrelevant to the needs of industries and communities. Second, through scholarships and student\nloan funds, students from low-income families can avail themselves of opportunities to enroll in\nTESD programs of their choice in private and public institutions. Third, the Project will utilize\nTESD institutions, especially those in rural areas, as a vehicle to promote local economic\ndevelopment activities through various training programs.\n121. The Government  recognizes  the  importance of the  role  of  women  in  the country\u2019s\neconomic and social development. Building on the newly developed programs at the National\nVocational  Training  and  Development  Center  for  Women  under  TESDA,  the  technology-\noriented trade training programs will be expanded to give more opportunities to women across\nthe  country.  Career  counseling  and  job  placement  services  to  be  established  in  TESD\ninstitutions will help women, the poor, and minority groups find employment in their fields.\n122. The  social  impacts  of  the  Project  will  be  monitored  through  (i)  enrollment  and\nachievement patterns in public and private TESD institutions; (ii) success rates of the target\ngroups in aggregate and by region; (iii) success rate and employment patterns of the recipients\nof scholarships; (iv) employment rates of graduates; and (v) average salaries and starting\nemployment positions of the graduates from various programs. (Detailed social assessment is in\nAppendix B.)\n                                               \n44 Loan 247-PHI: Development Bank of the Philippines, for $25 million, approved on 9 December 1975; Loan 321-\nPHI: Second Development Bank of the Philippines, for $35 million, approved on 29 November 1977; and Loan\n1088-PHI: Third Development Bank of the Philippines, for $100 million, approved on 16 July 1991.\n45 PPA: PHI 24112: Third Development Bank of the Philippines. December 1999.", "30\nH. Technical Assistance\n123. ADB  will  provide  TA  to  assist  the  Government  in  strengthening  the  management\ncapacity of TESDA and a network of regional and provincial institutions including LGUs, to\nenable them to provide effective leadership and support to public and private institutions. The\nTA will contribute directly to the improvement of the quality of TESD programs, which in turn will\nproduce  a qualified  skilled  workforce  whose higher productivity  will  enhance  the  country\u2019s\ncompetitiveness in the global market.\n124. The TA consists of three major components: (i) strengthening the management capacity\nof TESDA and its network of regional and provincial institutions and LGUs; (ii) improving the\nquality  of  TESD  programs  through  the  development  and  implementation  of  accreditation\nsystems,  quality  assurance  programs,  dual  training  systems,  apprenticeship  systems;  and\n(iii) enhancing the employment opportunities of TESD graduates through the institutionalization\nof career guidance and counseling services, job placement and support services, industry-\ninstitution linkages, and entrepreneurship development programs in TESDA institutions.\n125. The  TA  will  provide  16  person-months  of  international  consultants  and  34  person-\nmonths of domestic consultants and will be implemented over 18 months. The estimated total\ncost is $1,115,000 equivalent, of which $495,000 is the foreign exchange cost and $620,000\nequivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will provide $775,000 covering the entire foreign\nexchange cost and $280,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will meet\nthe remaining local currency cost of $340,000 equivalent, which represents expenditures (in\ncash or in kind) for the remuneration of counterpart staff, office space, production of documents,\nlocal transportation, and other administrative expenses. The TA will be financed on a grant\nbasis from the Asian Currency Crisis Support Facility, provided by the Government of Japan.\nAppendix 10 gives TA details, cost estimates, and financing plan.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\n126. The Project responds to the requirements for competitiveness and equity; addresses key\nweaknesses in the present TESD system, supports the implementation of well-conceived plans\nfor skills development, takes into account lessons from previous assistance, conforms with\nADB\u2019s country strategy and education policies, finances soundly designed components of a\nclear project strategy, and incorporates feasible financing and  implementation  plans.  More\nspecific justification is given in the following paragraphs.\nA.  Economic Justification\n127. Economic analysis determined the economic viability and return on investment for the\nProject. The economic internal rate of return is estimated at 14.6 percent, which is above ADB\u2019s\nstandard economic opportunity cost of capital of 12 percent. Sensitivity tests (with 10 percent\nincrease or decrease in project benefits) show a reduced internal rate of return of 11.6 percent.\nThe Project is viable from the national economic perspective (Appendix D).\nB.  Rationalization of the Skills Development System\n128. TESDA will be strengthened and focused to develop policies, occupational standards,\nand  curricula;  pursue  staff  development;  and  evaluate/disseminate  information  on  the\nperformance of the system. These functions are properly those of the public sector and the\ncentral TESD coordinating agency. Assistance in these areas is justified by its multiplier effect", "31\nthrough  relatively  small  investments.  This  is  especially  true  for  badly  needed  quality\nimprovements. The Project will facilitate the implementation of a well-conceived system where\nemployers drive the development of competency standards and skills acquisition through testing\nand certification. In total, about 175,000 TESD trainees will receive improved training through\nTESDA\u2019s activities in course improvement, instructional materials, and staff development. These\nquality  improvements  are  expected  to  result  in  significant  increases\u2014on  the  order  of\n20 percent\u2014on the currently low pass rates in national skills examinations.\n129. The project public training institutions will be devolved to LGUs, the communities, NGOs,\nor local institutions. This benefits the system through better linkages with local labor markets,\ngreater private resource mobilization, and consequent reductions in dependence on government\nfinancing. In this context, investments in upgrading public institutions can be justified by the fact\nthat these institutions offer types of courses not normally given by private providers, and by the\neventual cost savings on the government budgets realized through possible increased user fees\nand  other  income-generating  activities.  Moreover,  interventions  such  as  adoption  of\ncompetency-based curricula and staff training are expected to stimulate major improvements in\nquality. About 8,650 teachers and administrators from both public and private institutions will\nbenefit  from  staff  development  programs.  The  assistance  is  expected  to  increase  the\neffectiveness and relevance of instruction greatly. This, in turn, is projected to reduce dropout\nrates and increase the employability of graduates (Appendix D).\n130. Private training institutions have fewer constraints on their ability to improve and expand\nservice offerings. Private providers have better linkages with the job market and lower cost per\ngraduate than public institutions do, and their beneficiaries absorb virtually all costs. Support for\nprivate institutions through the FTESD is justified by the present constraints that impede access\nto necessary financing for improvements and expansion of private training. About 120 private\ntraining institutions will benefit from this component. In addition, their staff will be able to access\nstaff development programs, curricula, and teaching materials (at  cost) from  TESDA.  This\nrepresents a significant policy shift, in which the role of government is  seen as providing\nassistance to all parts of the system, regardless of ownership.\nC.  Social Dimensions\n131. The Project is also justified by its expected contribution to poverty reduction. TESD\ninstitutions have been found to enroll a high proportion of students from low-income families.\nThe least financially able of these groups will qualify for scholarships and educational loans to\nbe provided under the Project. At least 25,000 students will complete their training with financial\nsupport from the SF and the SLF. Investment in public TESD institutions is also justified in\nrelation to the prevailing subsidies received by general secondary and postsecondary schools\nwhose  clientele  for  the  most  part  represents  families  with  higher  household  incomes.  In\nsummary, the Project is justified by its contributions to improve equity to TESD among the poor.\nIt will ensure completion of training and acquisition  of  income-generating  skills for  sizable\nnumbers of low-income trainees.\nD. Impact on Poverty\n132. The Project is designed to improve the quality of the technical workforce and to enhance\nequitable access and opportunities for the poor to acquire employable skills. In addition to\nimproving the quality of the TESD system as a whole, the Project will strengthen and enhance\ntraining facilities and resources in all 13 regions of the country. It will provide scholarships and\nloans to approximately 25,000 low income students, particularly women, to avail themselves of", "32\nTESD training opportunities. The Project will strengthen linkages between TESD institutions and\nprivate businesses and industries. It will also help institutionalize career guidance and job\nplacement services in the project institutions. These support services will help TESD graduates\nfind appropriate employment. The EMIS, to be further strengthened under the Project, will\nenable TESD institutions to plan and manage their programs effectively. The EMIS will further\nensure that relevant training is provided to support a good match between the demand for and\nsupply of appropriate skills in the localities. Overall, the Project directly addresses poverty\nissues among the poor who are the main clients and beneficiaries of the TESD system.\n133. Incremental benefits that will accrue to poor workers can be measured in terms of higher\nincome. Without the benefit of training, poor workers are inclined to receive wages lower than\nthe nominal minimum wage rate of $4.95 equivalent per day. TESDA studies show that with\ntraining, these workers are in a better position to get at least the minimum wage and higher in\nmost cases. The potential income of the project beneficiaries would thus range from $6.44 to\n$9.90 equivalent per day. With additional skills and knowledge, those who will be self-employed\nor  entrepreneurs  can  earn  higher  incomes.  The  financial  impact  of  the  Project  on  the\nbeneficiaries is relatively greater because the majority are unemployed or underemployed, and\nhave little or no forgone income during the training period. For them, the quality of life is likely to\nbe improved. In addition, staff development programs will enhance the marketability of the\ntrainers and will help improve their incomes.\n134. The  impact  of  the  Project  on  poverty  can  be  assessed  on  the  following  criteria:\n(i) number of students/trainees from families below the official poverty line enrolled in public and\nprivate TESD institutions; (ii) the gender ratio of students/trainees  in  TESD programs;  (iii)\nnumber and ratio of TESD students from the disadvantaged and minority groups; (iv) number of\npoor who receive scholarships and educational loans to attend TESD institutions under the\nProject; (v) number of TESD graduates employed or self-employed, their occupations, and their\nincome levels after graduation, particularly the poor who received scholarships; and (vi) number\nof graduates who find better jobs and employment opportunities, or start their own business\nenterprises that help create jobs and generate employment in the communities.\n135. The impact of the Project on poverty reduction will be closely monitored and assessed\nthrough the benefit monitoring and evaluation system to be developed under the Project. The\nproject impact will be measured on the basis of national and provincial poverty incidence.\nImpact tracer studies will also assess the overlap of benefits to families and to spin-offs of\nemployment created by graduate entrepreneurship. These measures will be incorporated into\nthe overall EMIS to be developed under the Project.\nE. Financial Sustainability\n136. The question of financial sustainability pertains mainly to the institutions that will be\nshifted  from  central  or  provincial  management  to  local  ownership.  Some  will  become\nautonomous, self-managed institutions relying mainly on their own revenues. Others, depending\non the devolution plans adopted, will come under the control of LGUs. In all cases the training\ninstitutions will be encouraged to generate and increase their own earnings from a variety of\nactivities including increased student fees, sale of products from shops and farms, sale of\nprograms and services to the public, sponsorship from industry, and similar activities. The\ninstitutions will be encouraged to take an active role in promoting these activities and allowed to\nretain incomes to support their training programs. As part of the devolution process, LGUs will\nbe involved in assisting the training institutions to cover recurrent costs on a declining basis to\nmaintain project facilities, activities, and programs after the Project is completed.", "33\n137. Other parts of the project will also generate some revenues. The expanded system of\noccupational tests will be self-financing for the most part, as test takers pay test fees. TESDA\nwill recover part of the project cost through revenues generated by the sale of courseware,\ncurriculum guides and training packages to private institutions.\nF. Risks\n138. Three main risks exist for the Project. First, training institutions risk loss of quality as they\nmove from TESDA to local or self-administration. That is because TESDA has staff with higher\nqualifications and often allocates more resources to institutions under its direct administration.\nThe Project counters this risk by providing ample staff development for local governments and\nadministrators  of  training  institutions,  and  assistance  to  build  training  facilities.  Recent\ninnovations also provide a basis for monitoring quality, e.g., competency-based training with a\ncheck on exit quality through testing. These will be improved and expanded under the Project.\nTESDA will check quality trends and advise on remedial actions should any significant decline in\nquality occur.\n139. Second, a project of this size and diversity inevitably faces implementation risks. It could\nbe too much for one organization to manage. This risk is minimized because the organizations\n(DBP and LBP) that will handle two main project components\u2014FTESD and the SF\u2014have\nextensive experience in handling similar programs. In addition, the main implementing agency,\nTESDA, has had experience in implementing externally financed projects. Its performance in the\nrecently completed World Bank-financed Second Vocational Training Project was rated highly\nsatisfactory.\n140. Third, risk is associated with the capacity and willingness of the LGUs, other government\nagencies, NGOs, and the local communities to adopt, finance, and effectively manage the\ndevolved project institutions. To counter this potential risk, TESDA has already initiated dialogue\nwith the agencies concerned and will develop a comprehensive devolution plan in consultation\nwith LGUs and other agencies. Initially, it is expected that selected schools among the project\ninstitutions would serve as pilot  cases. But, based  on  experience  and  lessons  learned, a\ndevolution scheme will be implemented more widely.\n141. Other risks exist, but they are considered minor. Private training institutions may not, in\nthe end, avail themselves of the loan funds available for quality improvements under the Project.\nHowever, such an outcome would contradict the current evidence of capital constraints in the\nfeasibility study carried out in 1999. If loan uptake is low, ADB and DBP will investigate the\nreasons and amend the terms accordingly. DBP will carefully assess the financial soundness of\nthe potential borrowers to assure full repayments of the loans and interest. Improper targeting of\nscholarships  could also occur,  but  this  has  not  been  a  problem  under  present  schemes.\nRecipients of educational loans may fail to repay their dues but mechanisms have been built in\nto enhance higher rates of repayment. Similarly, a risk exists that the Government\u2014facing\nbudget shortages\u2014will cut PESFA scholarships. An assurance included in the Project cements\nthe commitment to continue, at least at the present level.", "34\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA. Specific Assurances\n142. In addition to the standard assurances,  which  have  been  incorporated  in  the  legal\ndocuments, the Government and DBP have agreed to the following specific assurances:\n(i)  TESDA  and  DBP  will  cooperate  closely  in  conducting  public  campaigns  to\npromote the FTESD among eligible private institutions.\n(ii)  Throughout the implementation period, the Government will maintain the number\nand value of PESFA scholarships administered by TESDA at a level not less\nthan that financed in 1999.\n(iii)  The  Government  will  introduce  measures  to  ensure  that  public  training\ninstitutions are able to retain and use, for the training purposes, the revenues\nthey generate through tuition charges, sale of courses and sale of products and\nservices.\n(iv)  DBP will maintain a capital adequacy ratio of at least 10 percent and a minimum\nreturn on average total assets of at least 0.3 percent.\nB.  Conditions for Disbursements of Loan Proceeds to Public Institutions\n143. The Government agreed that no withdrawals will be made for:\n(i)  any provincial training center or Project institution until the Government, ADB,\nand the LGU or NGO concerned agree on a detailed and time-bound devolution\nplan for that provincial training center or Project institution, which plan includes a\ndetailed  devolution  strategy  and  legal  framework,  a  detailed  implementation\nschedule (which, to the extent possible, will provide for devolution during Project\nimplementation),  a  financial  plan  and  forecast,  and  a  detailed  development\nstrategy;\n(ii)  establishing and equipping skills assessment centers throughout the country,\ntraining the personnel therefor, and improving the provincial training centers, until\nthe NDF Credit Agreement is effective or other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\nare made, for the financing of these activities, within 12 months from date the\nLoan Agreement with ADB becomes effective;.\n(iii)  establishing and equipping skills assessment centers throughout the country,\ntraining the personnel therefor, upgrading the Project institutions, and improving\nthe provincial training centers, until the OPEC Loan Agreement is effective or\nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB are made, for the financing of these\nactivities, within 12 months from date the Loan Agreement with ADB becomes\neffective;\n(iv)  upgrading the Project institutions, and improving the provincial training centers,\nuntil  the  DANIDA  Credit  Agreement  is  effective  or  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB are made, for the financing of these activities, within 12\nmonths from date the Loan Agreement with ADB becomes effective;\n(v)  Student Loan Fund until the detailed implementation procedures therefor have\nbeen  agreed  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  all  documents  and\nagreements deemed necessary therefor by ADB, in its sole discretion, shall have\nbeen duly authorized, executed and delivered, and all conditions necessary for\nthe proper implementation of the Student Loan Fund fulfilled.", "35\nVII.

Rationale. Many private technical education and skills development (TESD) institutions\nneed  to  improve  the  quality  of  their  programs.  To  assist  these  institutions,  which  enroll\napproximately 80 percent of TESD students, the Project will establish the Fund for Technical\nEducation and Skills Development (FTESD) to provide loans to eligible institutions.\n2. Scope and objectives. From FTESD the Development Bank of the Philippines (DBP)\nwill provide subloans to eligible private TESD institutions that will use the loan funds to procure\nequipment and instructional materials, improve courses and programs, set up staff development\nprograms, and upgrade facilities but excluding the construction of new buildings.\n3. Source  of  fund.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  will  provide  a  loan  of\nY2,166,700,000 through its market-based loan window to DBP with government guarantee to\nset up the FTESD.\n4. Eligible borrowers. Private TESD institutions offering postsecondary, nondegree TESD\nprograms  in  priority  areas  such  as  information  technology,  engineering  technology,  food\ntechnology and services, and tourism among others are eligible to borrow from FTESD.\n5. Criteria for evaluation and award. Private TESD institutions wishing to apply for a loan\nwith DBP will first register their programs with TESDA for subsequent program assessment and\naccreditation. The registered institutions will then be eligible to borrow from the FTESD for any\nor  combination  of  the  following  purposes:  (i)  upgrading  facilities  such  as  workshops,\nlaboratories,  or  academic  buildings;  (ii)  purchasing  equipment,  instructional  materials,  and\nbooks in the priority areas; (iii) staff development programs; (iv) developing and implementing\nnew programs; (v) improving or expanding cooperation programs with the private sector to\nenhance  training  and  employment  prospects  of  graduates;  and  (vi)  other  related  quality\nimprovement programs to be considered on a case-by-case basis. Each applicant will submit a\ncompleted application form to any DBP branch or headquarters. The information will include\n(i) educational data for the institution, (ii) financial status of the institution, (iii) project proposal\nincluding a description of the project and expected benefits, (iv) personal data of the owners or\nshareholders, (v) audited financial statements of the institution, (vi) cash-flow analysis and\nrepayment schedules, and (vii) long-term (i.e., 10 years) institutional development plan including\nenrollment projections. DBP will evaluate the application based on, but not limited  to,  the\nfollowing criteria: (i) relevance of the project objectives and scope to the priority skills areas and\naccreditation  standard;  (ii)  benefits  to  the  students,  communities  and  local  economy;\n(iii) educational  values  and  relevance  to  the  long-term  institutional  development  plan;\n(iv) financial feasibility and return on investment of the project; (v) financial capacity of the\nborrower; (vi) soundness and economy in the use of resources for the intended purposes; (vii)\nimplementation  plan,  monitoring  and  reporting  of  the  progress  of  the  Project;  and  (viii)\nmanagement\u2019s ability and commitments to improve the quality of the supported programs to\npass the accreditation standards.\n6. Implementation arrangements. DBP headquarters will manage the FTESD. Eligible\nprivate TESD institutions can apply for a loan at any DBP lending outlet. DBP will evaluate the\napplication based on the criteria described in para. 5.  In particular,  DBP  will give  special\nemphasis to educational values and benefits of the Project and the institution\u2019s creditworthiness\nand financial capacity to repay the loan. A loan must be fully secured by real estate mortgage\nand chattel mortgage or collateral substitutes, and joint and several signatures of the principals", "58\nAppendix 5, page 1\nof the borrowing entity. ADB will regularly review the subloan approval process to ensure its\ntransparency and effectiveness. Based on the number of applicants and requirements for loan\nfunds, DBP will submit quarterly to ADB withdrawal applications for release of the loan proceeds\nfor disbursements to the subborrowers.\n7. Terms and conditions. The ADB loan to DBP will finance up to 80 percent of the loan\nto the eligible private TESD institutions, with the borrower contributing 20 percent of the total\nproject cost in the form of equity participation. The loan will have a maximum period of 10 years,\nbut not longer than the economic life of the assets financed, to be determined jointly by DBP\nand the borrower on a case-by-case basis. DBP will allow a grace period of 6-24 months after\nthe initial drawdown. Thereafter, quarterly payments of equal amount are made until the loan\nmatures. A commitment fee of 0.75 percent per annum will be charged on the undisbursed\nportion of the loan.\n8. Interest rate. The interest rate will be determined on the basis of full cost recovery. The\nindicative  interest  rate  as  approved  by  the  Department  of  Finance  ranges  from  11.5  to\n14.0 percent. In addition, a front-end fee of 1 percent will be charged on the loan amount.\n9. Disbursement procedures. DBP will set up a separate account for the FTESD at DBP\nheadquarters. DBP will submit withdrawal applications to ADB for release of the loan proceeds\nquarterly based on the needs of the subborrowers.\n10. Monitoring, supervision, and reporting requirements. DBP will visit the projects and\nthe borrowing TESD institutions at least annually to monitor the use of the loan funds and to\nensure full compliance with the terms and conditions of the loan. As part of its requirements for\nthe registration and accreditation process, TESDA will also inspect the projects and assess the\ntechnical benefits  to and  impact of the  loans  on  the  students  and  staff  of  the  borrowing\ninstitutions. ADB, DBP, and TESDA may hold consultative meetings and field joint missions to\nreview the projects at the borrowing institutions. The borrowers of the subloans will submit a\nprogress report to DBP semiannually. DBP will submit semiannual reports to ADB on the\nimplementation status of the FTESD.\n11. Procurement. Goods and services to be financed by the subloans will be procured\nsubject to the provisions of the Guidelines for Procurement under Asian Development Bank\nloans  (para.  3.9  of  the  Guidelines).  The  borrowers  will  be  free  to  use  the  appropriate\nprocurement  procedures  subject  to  efficiency,  technical  acceptability,  and  reliability  of  the\nservices and goods and provided that goods and services are supplied from and produced in\nADB member countries.\n12. Beneficiaries. From a preliminary survey, it is envisaged that about 120 private TESD\ninstitutions will apply for loans with average amounts ranging from Y8,100,100 to Y27,000,000\nto a maximum of Y110,000,000. DBP will seek ADB\u2019s approval for a subloan amount between\nY55,000,000  -  Y110,000,000.  The  loan  funds  will  enable  the  borrowers  to  upgrade  their\nworkshops and laboratories, purchase equipment and instructional materials, and train faculty\nand staff, among others. These activities are expected to improve the quality of TESD programs\nin these schools.", "59\nAppendix 6, page 1\nSCHOLARSHIP FUND\n1. Rationale. A large number of poor Filipinos cannot afford to give their children education\nbeyond high school level. In addition, young people in rural areas have limited opportunities to\navail themselves of skills training or to further their education because of the unavailability of\ntraining facilities and schools in their vicinities. The Scholarship Fund (SF) established under the\nProject will assist those requiring financial assistance\u2014especially in rural areas\u2014to undergo\nboth formal and nonformal technical education and skills development (TESD) training in private\nand public institutions. The target beneficiaries are students living in the poorest regions and\nprovinces, but consideration will also be given to qualified students in other parts of the country.\n2. Objective. The SF will provide scholarship assistance to eligible trainees from families\nwhose  income  is  below  the  official  poverty  line.  A  student/trainee  meeting  this  income\nqualification must also maintain passing marks in his/her studies to continue to be eligible to\nreceive assistance.\n3. Allocation  process.  The  Technical  Education  and  Skills  Development  Authority\n(TESDA) will allocate available funds for scholarships to provinces based on its current formula\nfor Private Education Student Fund Assistance (PESFA) scholarships. Provinces with lower\naverage income will be given preference. Provincial offices of TESDA, in turn, will publicize the\navailability of the scholarship funds.\n4. Eligibility and selection process. The SF is intended to function much like a voucher.\nStudents and trainees whose family income is below the official poverty line can apply for a\nscholarship  to  study  in  formal  or  nonformal  TESD  programs  in  both  public  and  private\ninstitutions that are registered with or accredited by TESDA. Students already enrolled who\nmeet income eligibility and are in good academic standing with at least a passing grade for all\nsubjects can apply for assistance at the schools where they are enrolled. For enrollees of\nnonformal TESD programs, the enrollees will be given the scholarship only once to complete\nthe training program. For formal TESD programs, which require full-time studies leading to a\ncertificate or diploma below degree level, assistance may be extended after the first year until\nthe student completes the program, provided that the progress is satisfactory and completion is\nin a maximum of three years or within the standard duration of the programs. The school or\ntraining center will be required to report the individual student academic performance to TESDA\nthrough its provincial and regional offices on a semestral basis.\n5. Gender participation. To provide more opportunities and encourage women to enroll in\nTESD programs, 50 percent of the scholarships for formal and nonformal TESD training will be\nawarded to women.\n6. Selection  process.  Qualified  applicants  whose  family  earning  is  below  the  official\npoverty line can apply for a scholarship at a school or training center as either an entering or\ncontinuing student and trainee. They must submit an application form together with official proof\nof income of their family or themselves. For nonformal training, the age  limit for  qualified\napplicants is 40 years old. All applicants will be given standard vocational aptitude tests to\ndetermine their readiness and the suitability of the program they want to enroll in. If there are\nmore  applicants  than  the  available  scholarships  for  the  school,  province,  or  region  the\nscholarships  will  be awarded  to  those  with  top  scores  until  the  scholarship  funds  for  the\nschools/centers or provinces are exhausted. The schools, centers, and TESDA provincial and\nregional offices will ensure that the selection process is fair, transparent, and based on the", "60\nAppendix 6, page 2\nfinancial needs and academic ability of the students/trainees in accordance with the criteria\ndescribed in this section.\n7. Amount of scholarship. The maximum amount for each scholarship is P14,500 per\nstudent per academic year or, in the case of nonformal training, for the duration of the training\nperiod according to the prescribed or approved curriculum and program.\n8. The breakdown of the scholarship fund in order of priority for the different expenses is as\nfollows: (i) actual costs of tuition and other related school fees, (ii) costs of textbooks and\nrequired instructional materials as prescribed by the school/center for the course or training\nprogram, and (iii) living expenses.\n9. After the costs of the first two items have been calculated, the remaining amount of the\nP14,500  allocation  will  be for  living  expenses. As  a  general guideline,  the  living  expense\nallowance  should  not  exceed  P600  per  month  to  cover  transportation  and  meals  at  the\nschool/center. Living expenses will be provided to the recipients only during the time the schools\nor centers are in session, excluding the term break or long vacation.\n10. After the students have been selected for the scholarship, the school will decide in\nconsultation with the students and their parents/guardians the priority needs of the students and\nthe allowances needed to cover their actual living expenses. The school will then submit a list of\neligible students, together with the recommended scholarship amount for each student, to the\nprovincial and regional offices of TESDA, which will endorse the applicants to TESDA for final\napproval.\n11. Administration of the scholarship fund. The scholarship fund will be deposited in an\nimprest account for the Project at the central bank of the Philippines\u2014the Bangko Sentral ng\nPilipinas (BSP). TESDA has designated the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), which has\nextensive experience in managing government student assistance and loan programs, to be the\ndepository bank for the SF and to be responsible for disbursing assistance directly to the\nrecipients for living allowances and other related expenses and to the schools for tuition and\nother  school  fees.  LBP  has  a  comprehensive  network  of  branches  in  small  towns  and\ncommunities throughout the country. To operationalize the SF, TESDA will open an account\nwith LBP. TESDA periodically will transfer the SF proceeds from the imprest account at BSP to\nthe LBP scholarship account upon submission of reports, necessary documents, and withdrawal\napplication by LBP. The Scholarship Fund account, which is an interest-bearing account with\nLBP, will maintain an average weekly balance of a total peso equivalent of $1 million.\n12. Disbursements of scholarship funds to the  recipients. The scholarship amounts will\nbe disbursed to the recipients on a monthly basis, and the tuition and other related fees will be\npaid directly to the schools on a term basis. LBP has developed a software package called\nPACSVAL, which will be given to TESDA to maintain a database on the recipients of the\nscholarships and to provide data and information to LBP three days before the payment date to\nthe  recipients  and  the  schools  where the  recipients  will  be  enrolled  for  disbursements  of\nscholarship funds to the recipients. LBP will transfer the scholarship funds representing the fees\nand allowances of the recipients to the respective LBP branches for credit to the accounts of the\nrecipients using the online facilities of LBP. All fund transfers of tuition fees to the schools will be\nmade directly to the schools in accordance with the instruction of TESDA.\n13. Operation of the recipient subaccounts. The recipients of the scholarships will open\nand maintain either regular savings account with passbook or savings account with ATM access\nat the designated LBP online branches. The funds will be transferred to the designated account", "61\nAppendix 6, page 3\non a monthly basis. The scholarship recipients will be required to sign a receipt form that is\nmaintained at the institutions in which they are enrolled. The schools will submit the records to\nTESDA through the provincial and regional offices for verification and validation purposes.\n14. Reporting  requirements.  The  monthly  consolidated  bank  statements  of  the\ndisbursement status, together with the supporting documents, will be forwarded by LBP to\nTESDA 10 working days after the end of the month. In addition, a separate semiannual report\non  the  amount  received,  released,  and  outstanding  balance  of  all  accounts  will  also  be\nsubmitted to TESDA.\n15. Beneficiaries.  Approximately  20,000  students/trainees  will  benefit  from  the  SF.\nTESDA\u2019s  monitoring  and  evaluation  system  will  make  periodic  checks  to  ensure  that  the\nrecipients actually meet the income criterion set as the basis for access to funds. This is\nimportant to ensure that appropriate targeting is actually achieved and the beneficiaries are the\nmost deserving.", "62\nAppendix 7, page 1\nPROJECT COST ESTIMATES\nTable A7.1: Project Cost Estimates by Item of Expenditure - TESDA Loan\n(in $ million)\nTotal Project Cost\nForeign Local Total\nExchange Cost Cost\nA.

Objectives and Scope\n1. The technical education and skills development (TESD) subsector needs to improve the\nquality and relevance of its programs, enhance equity and access to TESD among the poor and\nrural population and promote closer cooperation between business and TESD institutions. As the\noversight  agency  for  the  TESD  subsector,  the  Technical  Education  and  Skills  Development\nAuthority (TESDA) needs to strengthen its capacity, role, and functions to carry out its mandate\nmore effectively with the ultimate objective of divesting its current function as provider of TESD to\nlocal government units (LGUs) and other agencies. Within this context the technical assistance (TA)\nwill assist the Government in establishing quality control systems in TESD, strengthening the\nmanagement and supervisory capacity of TESDA and its network, and enhancing employment\nopportunities  and  prospects  for  TESD  graduates.  Ultimately,  the  TA  will  contribute  to  the\nimprovement of the quality of TESD programs that, in turn, will produce better-qualified skilled\nworkers, thus enhancing the competitiveness of the country.\n2. The TA consists of three major components.\n(i)  Strengthening the management capacity of TESDA as the oversight agency for the\nTESD subsector, its network of regional and provincial institutions, and LGUs to\nprovide effective leadership and support to public and private providers of TESD\nprograms.\n(ii)  Improving  the  quality  of  TESD  programs  through  the  development  and\nimplementation  of  an  accreditation  system,  skills  testing  and  certification,\nequivalency  system,  quality  assurance  programs,  dual  training  system,  and\napprenticeship system.\n(iii)  Enhancing  the  employment  opportunities  of  TESD  graduates  through  the\ninstitutionalization  of  career  guidance  and  counseling  services,  job\nplacement/support  services,  industry-institution  linkages,  entrepreneurship\ndevelopment programs, etc., in TESD institutions.\nB.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n3. The total cost of the TA (Table A10.1) is estimated at $1,115,000 equivalent, including\n$495,000 in foreign exchange costs and $620,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a grant of $495,000 to fund all foreign exchange\ncosts and $280,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The Government will contribute the\nequivalent of $340,000 largely in kind. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Asian\nCurrency Crisis Support Facility provided by the Government of Japan.\nC. Implementation Arrangements\n4. TESDA will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will be responsible for providing\nadministrative and counterpart support to the consultants. TESDA will provide counterpart staff to\nwork closely with the TA consultants for each component. The TA advisory committee will be\nappointed by TESDA and chaired by the project director. The main function of the committee is to\nguide the work of the consultants and assess the outputs/deliverables produced by the consultants\nto ensure high quality and standard of the products and direct contributions to the improvement of", "68 Appendix 10, page 2\nquality, relevance, efficiency, and effectiveness of the TESD system. The outputs of the TA will be\npresented to the TESDA governing body for endorsement and implementation within the broader\nframework of the Project.\n5. The TA will be implemented in three phases over 18 months. In the first phase, international\nand domestic consultants will review, design, and prepare a list of expected outputs for ADB\u2019s and\nTESDA\u2019s approval. In the second phase, TESDA will implement the outputs for 6 months, evaluate\nthe outcomes, and identify any weaknesses of the system for further improvements. During the\nthird  phase,  the  consultants  will  further  refine  and  improve  the  system  for  better\nresults/performance. The TA will require the services of six international consultants for 16 person-\nmonths, and eight domestic consultants for a total of 34 person-months. An international consulting\nfirm will be recruited by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the recruitment of domestic consultants.\n6. TESDA personnel, at both central and local levels who will be responsible for implementing\nand supervising the systems/mechanisms to be developed under the TA will undertake study visits\nto regional countries such as Japan, Malaysia, Singapore,  and  Thailand  to  learn  how  these\ncountries manage the programs/systems in their TESD systems.\nTable A10.1: Estimated Cost of Technical Assistance\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

The DBP\u2019s orientation is a universal bank engaged in wholesale and retail lending\noperations with a significant retail presence. It lends to financial institutions as well as ultimate\nborrowers as may be required by its catalytic role in the economy.\nFinancial Performance in 1998\n4. DBP\u2019s gross income increased by 19 percent to almost P11 billion in 1998. Net income\nbefore  the  P  1.07  billion  additional  loan  loss  provision  mandated  by  the  BSP  reached\nP1.59 billion.  The  Bank\u2019s  net  income  after  loan  loss  provision  and  tax  amounted  to\nP515.14 million. In 1998, DBP declared cash dividends in the amount of P615.94 million for\n1997 and advanced partial payment of P188 million for 1998. In addition, the Bank declared", "71\nAppendix 11, page 2\nstock  dividends  of  P7.5  billion.  To  affirm  the  viability  of  DBP  as  a  government  financial\ninstitution,  DBP  has  constantly  remitted  cash  dividends  to  the  National  Treasury  totaling\nP5.85 billion for the past 12 years. (See Appendix 3 for financial statements and Audit Report.)\nCredit Rating\n5. DBP has retained for the third consecutive rating period its BBB pi (public information or\n\u201cpi\u201d) rating from Standard and Poor\u2019s, making it the highest rated Philippine bank.\nExperience in working with Donors\n6. DBP has worked with other donors over the years. In 1998 it concluded agreements\ntotaling P13 billion in new funds of which a large chunk is for financing requisites of small and\nmedium enterprises (SMEs). These were the P6.91 billion from Japan Overseas Economic\nCooperation Fund for the shipping industry and its subsectors and P5.81 billion from World\nBank for SMEs in manufacturing. A total of P12.44 billion fresh funds from at least six foreign\ncreditors were made available in 1998 to finance the Bank\u2019s various lending operations. Of this,\nP5.63 billion was secured to refinance DBP\u2019s 1993 Eurobonds that matured in July 1998.\n7. In September 1998, DBP signed the loan agreement for the second phase of Domestic\nShipping Modernization Programs (DSMP) with the Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of\nJapan. DSMP II is a Y20 billion loan that will expand the present coverage to include: shipyards,\nmaritime education, port development, and cargo handling facilities especially in rural areas.\n8. In December 1999 DBP signed two credit agreements with Japan Bank for International\nCooperation for (i) Environmental Infrastructure Support Credit Program II for Y20.5  billion, and\n(ii) Industrial Support Services Expansion Program II for Y35 billion yen as part of the 23rd yen\nloan package.\n9. Also in December 1999 DBP signed an agreement with Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau\n(KfW) Germany for support of a credit line for small and medium enterprises for DM50 million.\nBranches\n10. DBP has a network of 73 branches throughout the country. (Appendix 2)\nAccounting Standard\n11. DBP has been awarded the Most Outstanding Accounting Office Award twice in 1995\nand 1998 from the Association of Government Accountants of the Philippines (AGAP) for having\nexemplary met the criteria of timeliness, accuracy, and reliability set by the AGAP Committee on\nAwards. In receiving the award in 1995, DBP was one of only three awardees under the\ncorporate category.\nADB Experience with DBP\n12. ADB has provided 3 loans to DBP: (i) Development Bank of the Philippines (Loan 247-\nPHI for $25 million approved on 9 December 1975 and closed on 18 August 1982), (ii) Second\nDevelopment Bank of the Philippines (Loan 321-PHI for $35 million approved on 29 November\n1977 and closed on 20 February 1984), and (iii) Third Development Bank of the Philippines\n(Loan 1088-PHI for $100 approved on 16 July 1991 and closed on 27 March 1996).", "72\nAppendix 11, page 3\n13. The objectives of the Third Development Bank of the Philippines Project were twofold:\n(i) support private sector small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across a broad spectrum of\nindustries  by  augmenting  the  flow  of  long-term  industrial  credit,  and  (ii)  strengthen  the\ndevelopment finance activities  of  participating financial  institutions  (PFI)  and upgrade  their\ninstitutional capabilities. The Project aimed to promote SMEs and promote development in\nurban and rural areas. By blending their funds with those available under the Project, the PFIs\nwere expected to increase at prudent levels the maturity period of their loans.\n14. All three loans were rated partly successful. The project design of the third loan was\njudged not conducive to financing SMEs. It was suggested that in the future, the extent and the\nnature of the demand for credit should be assessed separately for SMEs, and the terms and\nconditions of the loan and its ability to fulfill the needs of SMEs must be carefully reviewed.\nSeparating SME lending programs from those that also cater to large-scale clients for SME\nlending may be more effective.\n15. For the Technical Education and Skills Development Project two separate surveys were\ncarried  out  to  determine  the  need  for  capital  of  private  technical  education  and  skills\ndevelopment (TESD) schools and their willingness to borrow including the amounts, interests,\nterms and conditions and financial capacity to repay the loans. DBP and Technical Education\nand Skills Development Authority (TESDA) were involved closely in the design and conduct of\nthe second survey carried out nationwide in 1999. The results of the survey indicated that there\nis sufficient demand for the loan amount of $20 million to be provided by ADB to DBP for\nonlending to private TESD schools.\n16. To promote the Fund for Technical Education and Skills Development TESDA and DBP\nwill  cooperate  closely  in  launching  public  campaigns  among  private  TESD  schools.  DBP\nbranches will also actively advertise the financing facility and assist the TESD schools in their\nareas in the application and selection process.\n17. With regard to DBP\u2019s performance as executing agency, the Project Performance Audit\nReport for the Project concludes that both DBP and the PFIs have exhibited strong financial\nperformance and have adhered to prudential financial management practices.1\n                                               \n1   Asian Development Bank.
