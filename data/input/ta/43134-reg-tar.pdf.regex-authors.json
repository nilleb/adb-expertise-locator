The regional cooperation and integration strategy adopted by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in 2006 identified trade and investment as one of its four pillars.1 The strategy \nprovides the basis for ADB's capacity building initiatives in the area of regional trade. Trade \npolicy capacity varies significantly across Asia and the Pacific, with some countries lacking the \nskills needed to take advantage of new opportunities created by global and regional integration. \nADB's regional departments and the Office of Regional Economic Integration are engaged in \nvarious  capacity-building  activities  for  ADB's  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  The \nproposed Regional Capacity Development Technical Assistance for Trade Finance Capacity \nDevelopment  (the  R-CDTA)  seeks  to  strengthen  capacity,  and  specifically  deals  with \ndevelopment issues that impede trade.  \n \n2.  The  proposed  R-CDTA  is  linked  to  a  number  of  ADB's  strategies  and  business \nopportunities as presented in: (i) country partnership strategies (CPSs), (ii) regional cooperation \nstrategy and programs (RCSPs), and (iii) country operations business plans (COBPs) for ADB's \nDMCs. A review of these documents underscores the importance of trade finance capacity \ndevelopment in DMCs to enable ADB to meet its development objectives (Appendix 1 provides \nan overview of some of the specific RCSP, CPSs, and COBPs with direct links to the proposed \nTA).  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  importance  of  international  trade  as  a  tool  to  help  developing  countries  boost \neconomic  growth  and  generate  the  resources  necessary  for  reducing  poverty  cannot  be \noveremphasized. Trade (i) enhances a country's access to goods, services, technologies and \nknowledge; (ii) stimulates private sector entrepreneurial activities; (iii) creates jobs and attracts \nprivate capital; (iv) fosters vital learning processes; and (v) increases foreign exchange earnings.  \n \n4.  In ADB's experience, many DMCs and DMC banks are developing their capacity to \nsupport international trade, but some DMCs face difficulties in benefiting as they should from \ninternational trade. Constraints relating to trade can be broadly categorized as relating to: (i) \ntrade policy and regulation; (ii) poor physical infrastructure; and (iii) trade development issues, \nincluding access to trade finance and technology gaps.  \n \n5.  The R-CDTA for trade finance capacity development focuses on trade development \nissues that impede trade, including financing. Many DMC banks struggle to establish and/or \nmaintain correspondent banking relationships with international banks, which are needed to \naccess  liquidity  and  guarantees  in  support  of  trade.  Some  factors  (e.g.,  political  and \nmacroeconomic instability) are beyond their control, but DMC banks also often lack knowledge \nof trade finance instruments, and may be unable to provide standard financial information to \ninternational  banks.  Such  information  is  required  to  establish  trade  finance  lines  of  credit \nbetween international and DMC banks. The lack of trade finance and financial reporting capacity \namong many DMC banks extends to transparency and governance issues, and reduces credit \nline availability from international banks. As a result, less financial support is available for DMC \ncompanies  engaged  in  importing  and  exporting  of  goods  and  services.  This  reduces  the \navailability and increases the cost of trade finance in many least developed countries (LDCs), \nhindering their full participation in international trade, and increasing the risk that they will \nbecome more marginalized.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. \n ", "2   \n \n6.  The factors outlined above constrain ADB\u2019s DMCs to varying degrees. The R-CDTA will \nhelp ADB's DMCs bridge the gap between trade and development. The director general of the \nWorld  Trade  Organization  (WTO),  Pascal  Lamy,  noted  to  delegates  attending  a  WTO \nconvention in November 2008 that with respect to developing countries \"a priority task is to \nenhance capacity.\"2  Providing assistance to promote trade-related capacity development in \ndeveloping countries is an integral part of promoting the future economic development and \nprosperity of ADB's DMCs, and helping them integrate into the world trading system.  \n \n7.  The proposed R-CDTA is particularly relevant in the context of the current financial crisis, \nas DMC banks must retain and attract trade finance facilities to provide support for their clients' \nimport and export activities. \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the R-CDTA will be sustained economic growth and improved living \nstandards through the expansion of international and intraregional trade. This is particularly \nimportant given the current global crisis, as trade finance can play a positive role in cushioning \ndramatic declines in international and regional trade. Moreover, maintaining and enhancing \ntrade  finance  lines  in  a  counter-cyclical  environment  can  enable  DMCs  to  acquire  critical \ngoods\u2014including  medicine,  food,  fuel,  and  inputs  for  export  production\u2014needed  for \nsubsistence  and/or  fundamental  economic  activity.  The  outcome  of  the  R-CDTA  will  be \nenhanced capacity in DMCs and DMC banks, resulting in increased trade finance activity. \nSpecific outcome targets and the design and monitoring framework (DMF) are in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The order of priority in which the R-CDTA outputs and key activities will occur in DMCs \nis linked to the expansion of the Trade Finance Facilitation Program (TFFP). As described in the \nExpansion Strategy section of the report and recommendation paper for a major change in \nscope to the TFFP, countries will be targeted for expansion in an order of priority determined by \nmarket demand. This determination was supported by a survey of bank partners under the \nTFFP. Accordingly, this R-CDTA will start its work in the following countries (in order of priority, \nand  in  alignment  with  the  TFFP  expansion):  Viet  Nam,  Indonesia,  Philippines,  Mongolia, \nAzerbaijan,  and  Afghanistan. 3   Additional  R-CDTA  outputs  and  key  activities  related  to \nmonitoring, as noted below, will occur in those countries that are already active in the TFFP: \nBangladesh, Cambodia, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The proposed R-CDTA will have the following \nongoing outputs, starting in 2009 and ending in 2010.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  Financial Crisis Threatens Global Trade Flows, WTO Says. Bridges Weekly Trade News Digest, Volume 12, \nNumber 39, 19 November 2008. \n3  Priority of countries targeted may change according to demand. \n ", "  3\n1.  Knowledge building in Developing Member Countries   \n \na.  DMC Banks   \n \n10.  Consultants engaged under the R-CDTA will work in the field and conduct a total of 59 \nnew bank assessments from 2009 through 2010. The following countries are expected to be \ncovered:  Indonesia,  Philippines,  Mongolia,  Azerbaijan,  Uzbekistan, 4   Kazakhstan,  and \nTurkmenistan. Through this work, ADB will undertake financial due diligence on banks5 to \nidentify and characterize any gaps in the financial and technical capacity of individual DMC \nbanks that would inhibit the provision of trade finance credit lines. Information derived from the \nR-CDTA will benefit DMC banks by specifically identifying where they lack capacity, and will \nenable  ADB  to  provide  capacity  development  in  a  manner  that  is  tailored  and  specific  to \nindividual DMC banks and specific DMC banking systems.  \n \n11.  Specifically, the R-CDTA activities will entail, but not be limited to, the following:   \n \n(i)  work with individual DMC banks to acquire financial data;  \n(ii)  analyze the financial information through financial, ratio, gap and other analyses; \n(iii)  conduct  due  diligence  on  DMC  banks  through  (a)  meeting  with  banks;  (b) \nassessing  corporate  governance,  anti-money  laundering  policies,  and \nmanagement  capabilities;  and  (c)  asking  questions  related  to  performing  a \nfinancial analysis; \n(iv)  draft credit applications that are to be submitted to the TFFP; and \n(v)  conduct a banking sector analysis for each DMC. \n \n12.  The principle of repeat engagement is important to this R-CDTA, which views capacity \nbuilding in the medium and long term (i.e., something that cannot be achieved through a single \nengagement). As such, the R-CDTA proposes to conduct annual reviews of the same DMC \nbanks. ADB will undertake yearly financial assessments (and/or quarterly covenant reviews). \nThe annual reviews will help to solidify capacity development, and will create benchmarks \nenabling assessment of year-to-year improvements or declines in the capacity of a DMC to \nsupport trade finance credit lines. ADB expects 50 bank assessments will be conducted under \nthe R-CDTA in 2009 and approximately 150 in 2010. \n \nb.  Seminars   \n \n13.  Information on where individual banks lack capacity will be conveyed directly to those \nbanks on a confidential basis. In addition, the R-CDTA proposes to disseminate more general \ninformation about capacity gaps to a larger audience within DMCs through in-country seminars \nto which DMC banks, government officials and international banks will be invited. ADB plans to \nconduct a total of five seminars over the course of the R-CDTA (in Viet Nam and Indonesia in \n2009, followed by Philippines, Mongolia, and Azerbaijan).6  \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB is concerned about anti-money laundering policies in Uzbekistan. As such, the TFFP will only expand in this \ncountry once these concerns have been allayed. \n5  The R-CDTA will target banks on which there is market demand for capacity development and will coordinate with \nthe Trade Finance Facilitation Program in this regard. \n6  Countries  may  change  based  on  changing  demand.  These  reviews  may  be  conducted  on  banks  already \nparticipating in the TFFP.  \n ", "4   \n14.  The  seminar  content  will  be  based  on  aggregate  capacity  assessments  and \nrecommendations derived from financial analysis and due diligence of individual DMC banks, \nand will focus on the following: \n \n(i)  the existence of capacity constraints in the banking system that inhibit and/or \nimpede the maintenance or growth of trade finance credit lines to banks, such as \ncapital  adequacy,  provisioning,  credit  quality  (nonperforming  loans),  portfolio \nconcentrations, liquidity management, and profitability;  \n(ii)  gaps  and  related  recommendations  with  respect  to  transparency,  corporate \ngovernance  and  general  management  strategies  common  to  banks  within  a \nparticular DMC, which may impede the maintenance or growth of trade finance \ncredit lines; \n(iii)  identified lack of capacity in marketing and general outreach to SMEs, as well as \nother companies that could be better served by a DMC's banking sector for the \npurpose of supporting trade with finance; \n(iv)  enhancement of trade finance skills through discussion of various products used \nto mitigate risks in international trade; \n(v)  provision  of  recommendations  on  how  to  address  capacity  gaps,  both  with \nrespect to regulatory issues and bank-capacity issues; and   \n(vi)  creating an opportunity for DMC banks, government officials, and representatives \nfrom international banks to engage in an open dialogue concerning broader \nissues related to trade.   \n \n2.  Partnership Development \n \n15.  In response to the current financial crisis, international banks have reduced and/or cut \nDMC and DMC bank trade finance credit lines. Therefore, it is critical that the R-CDTA work in \nthe field, in coordination with the TFFP, to develop partnerships between international and DMC \nbanks.  Developing  partnerships\u2014such  as  correspondent  banking  relationships  with \ninternational banks\u2014is critical to fostering the financial support (trade finance credit lines) that \nunderpins international and regional trade in DMCs.  \n \n16.  ADB can approve TFFP credit lines to DMC banks through financial analysis and due \ndiligence on DMC banks. These credit lines will provide international banks with guarantees that \nwill  leverage  existing  DMC/DMC  bank  limits  available  to  support  trade.  The  field  work \nundertaken by R-CDTA will underpin the formation and maintenance of partnerships between \nDMC  and international banks, especially when international banks have no available DMC limit \nand the ADB guarantee is provided on a 100% basis. Similarly, as TFFP guarantees and \nfunding support specific trade transactions (through banks) between importers and exporters, \nthe work financed through the proposed R-CDTA will foster partnerships between importing and \nexporting companies. By assessing the financial position of various DMC banks and through \nADB\u2019s relationships and agreements with international banks, the R-CDTA will help to bridge \nthe gap between DMC and international banks, and indirectly between exporting and importing \ncompanies. These relationships will support increased flows of capital and goods essential for \neconomic activity. ADB anticipates that the capacity development supported through the R-\nCDTA will facilitate the formation and/or maintenance of 150 international bank relationships. In \naddition, through an activity not proposed for funding under the R-CDTA , the TFFP intends to \nstart listing on its website all DMC banks accepted under the TFFP for which credit limits have \nbeen approved. Working in conjunction with the TFFP, the R-CDTA will explicitly and implicitly \ncreate the opportunity for those DMC banks to be considered as correspondent banks by \ninternational banks.  \n ", "  5\n \n17.  The TFFP expansion plans cover a multiyear period. Table 1 provides a summary of the \nprojected R-CDTA outputs for the period of 2009\u20132010, and, for further information, for 2011 \nthrough 2013 (the latter are not covered under the proposed R-CDTA).  \n \n \nTable 1:  Projected Outputs for Technical Assistance Over 5 Years  \n         \nItem  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013 \nNew Bank Assessments  50  9  9  9  8 \nBank Monitoring \nAssessments  50  100  109  118  127 \nSeminars   2  3  3  3  3 \nInternational Bank  \nPartnerships  10  20  30  40  50 \nSource: ADB Capital Markets and Financial Sectors Division\u2014Trade Finance Facilitation Program. \n \n \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The R-CDTA is estimated to cost $6 million and will be financed on a grant basis jointly \nby (i) the Japan Special Fund (JSF), funded by the Government of Japan; and (ii) ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund-IV (TASF-IV). For 2009, the R-CDTA will be financed from \nthe TASF- IV ($1 million) and the JSF ($2 million). ADB will seek to secure funding for R-CDTA \nactivities for 2010 onwards through external resources, the TASF-IV, and/or the JSF. The funds \nwill cover remuneration, travel, and per diem for international consultants; conference-related \nexpenditures; and miscellaneous expenses. A detailed cost breakdown and proposed financing \nplan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency for the R-CDTA. PSOD will administer and implement \nthe  R-CDTA.  Disbursements  under  the  R-CDTA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.7 The R-CDTA will require approximately 253 \nperson-months of work. ADB, in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas  amended  from  time  to  time),  will  engage  a  total  of  11  international  consultants.  It  is \nanticipated that a firm will be employed; however, individual consultants may be used to provide \ninput as required in the course of contract execution. The proposed selection method and \nweighting for quality- and cost-based selection (QCBS) is 80% quality and 20% cost. QCBS will \nbe done on a full or simplified technical proposal basis. Outline terms of references are provided \nin Appendix 4.  \n \n20.  The R-CDTA is expected to run for 24 months, from April 2009 to March 2011. \n \n21.  To disseminate information emanating from the R-CDTA, the most salient parts of the \ntechnical assistance completion report will be published. \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2008.

The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2 million to be financed on a grant basis \nby the Government of Japan through the Japan Special Fund, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance not exceeding the equivalent of up to $4 million for the Regional Capacity Development \nTechnical Assistance for Trade Finance Capacity Development.  \n ", "Appendix 1  7 \nLINKS TO REGIONAL AND COUNTRY STRATEGY PROGRAMS AND  \nCOUNTRY OPERATIONS BUSINESS PLANS \n \n1.  As  noted,  the  proposed  regional  trade  finance  capacity  development  technical \nassistance (TA) addresses a number of developmental themes central to the priorities of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB): fostering intraregional trade; focusing on low-income countries; \nsupporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); and helping to mitigate the impact of \nthe global financial crisis on low-income countries. The Trade Finance Facilitation Program \n(TFFP) also supports two of the five drivers of change cited in ADB's long-term strategic \nframework  2008\u20132020  (Strategy  2020):1  (i)  private  sector  development  and  private  sector \noperations, and (ii) partnerships. It also focuses on two of the five core ADB specializations \nsupporting  Strategy  2020:  (i) regional  cooperation  and  integration,  and  (ii)  finance  sector \ndevelopment. Furthermore, it supports two pillars of the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nStrategy: (i) trade and investment cooperation and integration (pillar 2); and (ii) monetary, \nfinancial cooperation, and integration (pillar 3).2   \n \n2.  The proposed R-CDTA is directly linked to a number of the strategies and business \nopportunities presented in country partnership strategies (CPSs), regional cooperation strategy \nand programs (RCSPs), and country operations business plans (COBPs) for ADB's DMCs. A \nreview of these documents underscores the importance of trade finance capacity building in \nDMCs to enable ADB to meet its development objectives. The following is an overview of the \nlinks to some of the CPSs, COBPs, and RCSPs.   \n \nA.  Bangladesh \n \n3.  ADB's key objective for Bangladesh, as articulated in the 2006\u20132010 country strategy \npaper (CSP), is to help the country address critical constraints to broad-based economic growth, \nsocial development, and good governance. The strategy, implemented in conjunction with the \nWorld Bank, the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, and the \nGovernment of Japan, focuses specifically on the following:  (i) improving the investment climate \nfor private sector-led growth and employment, (ii) advancing the social development agenda to \nempower the poor; and (iii) addressing key governance issues on a sector and thematic basis. \nADB's private sector activities will complement those of the public sector and catalyze private \nsector investment in support of key infrastructure projects and the finance sector. Through the \ncurrent business plan\u2014as set forth in the COBP for 2009\u20132011\u2014ADB will continue to support \ninvestment as well as policy and institutional reforms in the energy, transport, education and \nintegrated urban infrastructure sectors. ADB will also continue to support SMEs and the finance \nsector. The CSP notes that ADB's past programs and projects in Bangladesh have been most \nsuccessful and sustained when they have been combined with capacity building. Consequently, \nthe  focus  in  coming  years  will  be  on  building  country  capacity  and  a  skills  base  among \ngovernment agencies and local experts.   \n \n4.  The  R-CDTA  directly  supports  the  strategy  of  the  CSP  and  COBP  through  the \ncombination  of  capacity  building  and  finance  sector  development  through  the  TFFP.  The \nprogram  will  enhance  the  capabilities  of  local  banks  to  identify  gaps  in  the  financial  and \ntechnical capacity of individual DMC banks that would inhibit the provision of trade finance credit \nlines and provide feedback on these issues. Additionally, through the seminars, the R-CDTA will \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "8  Appendix 1 \naim to strengthen the capacity of government officials to address broader trade development \nissues. The R-CDTA will also support improvements in the investment climate for growth and \nemployment led by the private sector. By increasing the capacity of local banks, the climate for \nthe private sector will improve with respect to attracting foreign bank interest and expanding \nfinancing to local businesses. Finally, the R-CDTA will complement two specific public sector \ninitiatives in the COBP: (i) the Development of Transport Corridor for Trade Facilitation Project \n(to be developed in 2009, it will strengthen physical infrastructure for trade); and (ii) the SME \nSector Development Program II (it will focus on enhancing infrastructure development and \naccess  to  finance  for  SMEs,  strengthen  the  capacity  of  organizations  working  for  SME \ndevelopment, and boost the capacity of the SME workforce). The R-CDTA will further help to \nincrease trade and the volume of goods traffic between Bangladesh and other countries in the \nregion by increasing the ability of SMEs to access trade finance, thus supporting job creation \nand increasing trade along transport corridors in Bangladesh. \n \nB.  Indonesia  \n \n5.  The current CSP for Indonesia seeks to address constraints to achievement of the \nGovernment of Indonesia's goals of supporting pro-poor, sustainable economic growth, and \npromoting social development.3 The CSP highlights past constraints, including an adverse \ninvestment  climate,  poor  physical  infrastructure,  an  underdeveloped  finance  sector,  weak \ndecentralized  capacities,  poor  public  sector  and  natural  resource  management,  and  low \ndevelopment spending. Based on these constraints, ADB is focusing on the following activities: \n(i) improving infrastructure and related services through increased public and private sector \ninvestment;  (ii)  deepening  the  finance  sector;  (iii)  improving  decentralization  with  greater \nregional spending; (iv) accelerating the achievement of Millennium Development Goals; and (v) \nstrengthening environmental and natural resources management. Trade finance is a priority \nonlending program that has been highlighted in support of ADB's goals with respect to finance \nsector development. \n \n6.  The R-CDTA will support ADB's strategic and business objectives in Indonesia. First, it \ndevelops the capacity and eligibility of Indonesian banks and the government to receive trade \nfinancing, both from private international sources/banks and from ADB's TFFP. Second, by \nlaying the foundations for increased trade finance and trade, it helps address job creation, which \nis a constraint to pro-poor economic growth. The CSP states that since 1997 most jobs have \nbeen  created  in  the  informal  sector  and  through  SMEs,  while  job  creation  in  trade, \nmanufacturing, and services has stagnated. Moreover, the CSP notes that overcoming these \nconstraints is critical if Indonesia is to respond to labor market mobility and trade liberalization in \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations Free Trade Area. Through capacity building, this R-\nCDTA will support the growth of trade in Indonesia, which will spur job creation in the trade \nsector. The R-CDTA also helps increase regional cooperation and integration, which is a goal of \nthe CSP. The CSP notes that ADB will help plan development projects with Indonesian national \nand regional significance, including trade facilitation. \n \nC.  Philippines   \n \n7.  The country strategy for the Philippines, as embodied in the 2009\u20132010 COBP (which \nextends  the  2005\u20132007  CSP),  focuses  on  supporting  fiscal  consolidation,  improving  the \ninvestment  climate  in  the  Philippines,  and  accelerating  attainment  of  the  Millennium \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (Indonesia): 2006\u20132009.  Manila (October). \n ", "Appendix 1  9 \nDevelopment Goals.4 Three of the five core areas of Strategy 2020 are incorporated in the \ncurrent country strategy: support for environment, infrastructure, and development of the finance \nsector. With respect to the private sector, operations will target infrastructure and finance sector \ninitiatives. Infrastructure projects are expected to include power and transmission, renewable \nenergy, water supply, and port operations. Regarding the finance sector, the COBP states that \nADB  will  seek  opportunities  to  (i)  provide  loans  to  domestic  banks  or  nonbank  finance \ncompanies to support microfinance and SMEs, (ii) support asset-backed securitizations, and (iii) \nprovide partial credit guarantees to support lending to SMEs. \n \n8.  The R-CDTA supports the strategic plans and objectives of the COBP and the CSP in \nnumerous ways. First, the CSP notes that ADB's public and private sector operations will \nreinforce  fiscal  consolidation  by  (i)  placing  less  demand  on  public  resources,  (ii)  reducing \npressure on public debt by allowing the Government access to foreign and local funds at \ncompetitive spreads and for longer maturities, and (iii) reducing the need for public spending by \n\"crowding in\" private participation. Enhancing the absorptive capacity of ADB's DMCs (including, \nin this case, the Philippines) for trade finance will decrease pressure on public resources\u2014\nparticularly  in  times  of  economic  crisis,  when  sources  of  funds  become  constrained\u2014by \nenabling alternative, nongovernment funding of projects in a number of sectors. Enhancing the \nability of banks in the Philippines to attract trade finance and international partners will have the \neffect of crowding in the private sector, which is a stated objective of the CSP. Finally, enabling \nbanks to gain access to trade finance will help to directly support infrastructure and SME \nbusiness opportunities, which are targeted growth segments articulated in the COBP.  \n \nD.  Sri Lanka \n \n9.  ADB's strategic focus for Sri Lanka is to strengthen the investment climate in the country \nand  achieve  socially  inclusive  development.  The  CPS  for  2009\u20132011  states  that  ADB  will \nsupport governance programs and private sector development through improvements in the \ninvestment climate. To strengthen the investment climate, ADB will (i) improve macroeconomic \nmanagement, (ii) introduce regulatory frameworks for private sector investments relating to \npublic-private partnerships, and (iii) increase the provision of economic infrastructure. ADB and \nthe World Bank conducted a joint investment climate assessment in 2005; as noted in the CPS, \nthe assessment concluded that the private sector is constrained by weak infrastructure and a \nlack of access to finance. Thus, ADB's strategy for supporting expansion of the private sector \nwill be to target higher levels of private investment and upgrade infrastructure, particularly in the \ntransport and power sectors. With respect to socially inclusive development, ADB will expand \naccess to high-quality services in the water, transport, and power sectors, and improve access \nto education. \n \n10.  The CPS notes that there is potential for Private Sector Operations Department to \nexpand  its  presence  in  Sri  Lanka  through  investments  and  financing  in  support  of  the \naforementioned strategy and targets. Specifically, future opportunities include power generation \nand port terminals. The CSP also highlights the current efforts of ADB's TFFP. Expansion of the \nTFFP will allow ADB to support additional financing and guarantees to banks in Sri Lanka, \nwhich will help improve the investment climate through access to finance. The R-CDTA is \ncritical to the TFFP's ability to expand its activities in Sri Lanka by enhancing bank capacity; this \nwill improve the investment climate and allow access to funds, which are two of ADB\u2019s key \nobjectives in Sri Lanka. \n                                                 \n4  The Philippines CSP for 2005\u20132007 is the current CSP. In 2008, ADB and the Government agreed to extend the \nCSP through the COBP for 2009\u20132010. \n ", "10  Appendix 1 \n \n \nE.  Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation  \n \n11.  The RCSP for 2006\u20132008 on the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) \nspecifically focuses on trade as one of the program\u2019s three building blocks in its efforts to \nalleviate poverty in the region.5 CAREC is a multi-institutional initiative, and participants have \nundertaken specific initiatives in order to efficiently achieve CAREC\u2019s aims. ADB is tasked with \ntrade facilitation and transport issues, while the International Monetary Fund is responsible for \ntrade policy.  \n \n12.  The trade facilitation program of CAREC comprises two components aimed at reducing \ntrade costs by (i) promoting concerted customs reform and modernization; and (ii) supporting an \nintegrated trade facilitation approach through efficient regional logistics development, better \nfocus  on  priority  trade  corridors,  enhanced  interagency  cooperation  and  public\u2013private \npartnerships, and support for the joint transport and trade facilitation strategy.6 The primary ADB \ntechnical assistance (TA) that supports facilitation of trade in CAREC is the Integrated Trade \nFacilitation Support for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation.7   \n \n13.  The proposed R-CDTA will complement the efforts undertaken to date by the public \nsector under the RCSPU. As noted, there have been a number of initiatives that address \nimprovement of the environment for trade and trade finance in the region. The program will \nleverage  the  work  that  has  been  completed,  which  lays  the  foundation  for  a  better  trade \nenvironment. Furthermore, it will strengthen the role of the private sector, thereby increasing \ntrade activity in the region, which is the ultimate goal of the RCSP. \n \nF.  Greater Mekong Subregion   \n \n14.  The RCSP for the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) for 2007\u20132009 aims to improve \nregional cooperation and integration in the GMS to foster greater economic prosperity and \nreduce poverty. The strategy has four pillars: (i) strengthening connectivity and facilitating cross-\nborder movement and tourism; (ii) integrating national markets to promote economic efficiency \nand  private  sector  development;  (iii)  addressing  health  and  other  social,  economic,  and \ncapacity-building issues associated with subregional links; and (iv) managing the environment \nand shared natural resources to help ensure sustainable development and conservation of \nnatural resources.8 In coordination with the RCSP, the GMS COBP for 2009\u20132011 focuses on \nprojects that boost physical and power connectivity in the region, and promote health and \nsafeguard  the  environment.  Additionally,  project  preparatory  TA  for  trade  facilitation  and \nlogistics development is planned for 2009. \n \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005.

Specifically, it will \naddress objectives (i) and (ii), as noted above. The R-CDTA will help to facilitate cross-border \nmovement and increase the role of the private sector in the region by increasing the likelihood \nthat  DMC  banks  will  be  able  to  access  trade  finance,  which  will  in  turn  encourage  local \nbusinesses to engage in intraregional as well as international trade.
