In  2003,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provided  technical  assistance  to  the \nGovernment of Nepal to establish an economic policy network1 to facilitate policy dialogue \namong  various  stakeholders,  foster  consensus,  and  secure  commitment  to  facilitate \nimplementation of the policy reform agenda. The Government has asked ADB to continue this \nsupport through a second phase. Consequently, this TA, Economic Policy Network II, was \nincluded in the 2007 program. The Fact-Finding Mission during 14\u201323 August 2007 gathered \ninputs  on  the  TA  scope  and  design;  and  met  with  government  agencies,  private  sector \norganizations,  and  policy  research  institutions.  It  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment  on  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  costs  and  financing,  tentative  implementation \narrangements, and counterpart support.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nepal implemented a policy reform agenda in the early 1990s to accelerate the pace of \neconomic development and reduce poverty in the country. However, the progress on the policy \nreforms has been inadequate due to weaknesses in policy formulation and implementation. The \n2003 ADB-supported TA helped the Government to (i) develop a network for economic policy \ndialogue  and  analysis;  (ii)  undertake  policy  research  and  analysis,  and  information \ndissemination  on  several  policy  issues,  and  (iii)  strengthen  networking  among  government \nagencies, private sector, academic institutions, and nongovernment organizations. \n \n3.  However, despite strong leadership by the Government line ministries, adoption and \nimplementation of the policy recommendations has been slow. The reform process needs to be \nsustained  and  consolidated  as  policy  reforms  involve  the  competing  interests  of  different \nstakeholders. Further, since implementation of the sector policy recommendations is largely \ndetermined by the line ministries, their ownership needs to be deepened to ensure that they \nundertake the policy reforms. The implementation status of the first phase of the support must \nbe assessed, and conditions identified to enhance implementation of policy recommendations.  \n \n4.  The  Government  is  preparing  a  3-year  interim  development  plan  to  address  the \ndevelopment challenges during the ongoing political transition. The main strategies identified in \nthe plan are reconstruction and rehabilitation of physical infrastructure, economic recovery, \ninclusive development, and economic and social transformation. The plan also aims to introduce \npolicy  reforms  to  move  the  development  agenda  forward.  Owing  to  the  country\u2019s  political \ndevelopments, some emerging areas of policy need sound analysis. Based on the analysis of \nthe  current  situation  and  consultations  with  relevant  stakeholders,  the  following  thematic \nclusters have been identified for related policy analysis:  \n \n(i)  Macroeconomic management and inclusive growth. Continued low growth is \na serious concern and needs immediate attention to formulate suitable policies \nfor achieving a higher growth rate. Appropriate policy initiatives are required to \nmeet the challenge of rising inequality. Similarly, management and utilization of \nforeign aid and regulation of nonbanking financial institutions need attention to \nensure sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction.  \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to Nepal for Establishing Economic Policy Network. Manila (TA 4288-NEP, \napproved in December 2003 and closed on 31 December 2006). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 July 2007. \n ", "2     \n(ii)  Decentralized governance. A transparent and efficient governance system is \nvital for effective implementation of policies and programs, and effective delivery \nof  local  services.  In  view  of  the  political  decision  to  adopt  federalism,  huge \nchallenges in terms of the relationship of the central and local governments must \nbe resolved for resource sharing, fiscal federalism, and other related issues. \n \n(iii)  Trade,  regional  integration,  and  private  sector  development.  Industrial \nperformance  has  been  weak  in  recent  years,  often  due  to  problems  of \nadjustments to the emerging new world trade order with regard to the World \nTrade  Organization,  and  other  regional  and  bilateral  trade  agreements.  The \nGovernment  must  have  strategies  to  gain  from  these  international  trading \narrangements and possess a strong position with clarity on the benefits to the \ncountry. Options need to be explored to devise policies to benefit from these \ninternational trading arrangements. Private sector investment must be attracted \nto  expand  industrial  activities  and  become  globally  competitive.  Creating  an \nenabling  environment  with  suitable  policies  for  attracting  private  sector \ninvestment remains crucial. \n \n(iv)  Social  inclusion  and  human  development.  Despite  marked  progress  in \npoverty  reduction,  human  development  indicators  are  not  very  encouraging, \nespecially  in  some  sections  of  society.  The  geographic  aspects  of  human \ndevelopment and horizontal inequality require the attention of policy makers. \nSocial policies to enhance access of all communities from all parts of country to \neconomic  opportunities  would  yield  sustained  economic  development.  At  the \nsame time, opportunities should be created for the general public to avail of \npublic services.  \n \n(v)  Infrastructure development. Poor infrastructure is a major barrier to growth. \nThe  role  of  infrastructure  for  poverty  reduction  by  creating  connectivity, \nparticularly in rural areas, has emerged as an important policy objective. Policies \nfor improving transport, communications, energy, and other related infrastructure \nshould be devised. \n \n(vi)  Agriculture  and  rural  development.  A  concerted  effort  will  be  required  to \nincrease the productivity of the agriculture sector to enhance rural income and \nemployment  growth,  and  concurrently  address  commercialization.  A  huge \ninvestment is required to transform the traditional subsistence agriculture into a \nvibrant commercial activity.  \n \n5.  Various findings and recommendations of the 2003 TA are incorporated in the fiscal \nbudgets of FY2006 and FY2007 and the 3-year interim development plan. However, the TA was \nfound to lack continuity due to the lack of a devoted institution for research and analyses on the \npublic policy reform agenda and process. The experiences gained through TA implementation \nconfirm a strong demand for an institution with a defined constituency to undertake networking \nwith all concerned stakeholders on the public policy reform agenda. The lessons from the TA3 \nsuggest a need to institutionalize the government system network created for public policy \nanalysis. The institution could serve as a focal body to identify policy issues; and undertake \npolicy dialogue with various stakeholders including government agencies, private sector, other \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2007.

It would also coordinate activities related to the pubic \npolicy reform agenda and be responsible for monitoring and evaluation. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The TA aims to establish a formal process of informed policy making in the Government \nwherein the policies developed and recommended are adopted to promote growth and reduce \npoverty. The TA will help to establish an institution with responsibility to undertake networking of \nthe socioeconomic reform agenda and policy analysis of the Government for achieving poverty \nreduction and human development. It will contribute to institutional capacity development for \ninformed policy-making processes of the Government. The ownership and consensus on the \npolicy reforms required for achieving the larger objective of sustainable growth and development \nin Nepal will be strengthened.  \n \n7.  The TA outputs include (i) plan of action for implementing the policy recommendations \nbased on review and assessment of the 2003 TA, (ii) policy papers based on research and \nanalysis  on  identified  and  emerging  issues  under  the  specified  thematic  clusters,  (iii) \nestablishment of an institution in the Government as a focal body to undertake networking and \nfoster policy dialogue among various stakeholders, and (iv) a mechanism for monitoring and \nevaluation of the policy reform agenda and impacts. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  A thorough assessment of internalization and use of the 32 policy papers4 prepared \nunder  the  2003  economic  policy  network  TA  will  be  undertaken.  An  action  plan  for \nimplementation of the policy papers will be prepared to guide follow-up activities. Policy papers \non specific issues identified under the thematic clusters will be prepared during the course of TA \nimplementation.  Policy  dialogue  will  be  undertaken  through  regular  national  and  local \nworkshops and seminars, as well as informal consultations with stakeholders. In an effort to \ndeepen the ownership of the policy recommendations by the Government, proposals will be \nsought from Government agencies, public policy institutions, and private sector associations by \nthe focal unit to seek financial assistance for research and analysis on policy issues. A template \nfor the proposal and evaluation criteria will be developed to ensure uniformity of the process.  \n \n9.  The TA will develop 2\u20133 options for institutionalizing the economic policy network in the \nGovernment system during the first 6 months of TA implementation. These options will be \nsubmitted to the steering committee for endorsement of one feasible option for establishing an \noperational network. The organization structure, operating procedures, and terms of reference \nwill be developed within 12 months of TA commencement. Private sector and civil society \nparticipation during the process and their integration into the institutional mechanism will be \nensured to achieve independence and transparency to the institution. Modalities needed for \nproper  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  the  activities  and  policy  actions  will  be  adopted.  A \ndissemination strategy will be developed to widely disseminate the TA outputs by using all forms \nof media. The dissemination material will take into account the language and education status of \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                 \n4  All  of  the  32  policy  papers  are  posted  at  www.mof.gov.np  under  four  thematic  areas:  (i)  macroeconomic \nmanagement; (ii) international trade, investment, and employment; (iii) infrastructure development and tourism; and \n(iv) agriculture and regional development. \n ", "4     \nthe target audience. This will enhance the understanding of the general public about the policy \nreform agenda and the process being followed for policy formulation.  \n \n10.  ADB will finance the studies, workshops, and seminars, as well as some of the costs \nborne in establishing the institution. The TA activities include the following: (i) establish a focal \nunit, steering committee, and thematic committees; (ii) support planning and review meetings of \nthe steering committee; (iii) identify specific research topics under each thematic cluster; (iv) \nprepare the template for the proposal and evaluation criteria; (v) commission policy studies, \nmonitor progress, and assess performance; (vi) prepare policy papers and a dissemination \nstrategy; (vii) conduct local consultations and expert technical workshops; (viii) develop options \nfor institutionalizing the network, and operating guidelines for the institution; (ix) hold policy \nseminars for opinion makers and stakeholders; and (x) produce and widely disseminate the \nreports. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000. ADB will provide $500,000 on a grant \nbasis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  main  components  to  be  funded  by  ADB  are \nconsultants, equipment, workshops and seminars, and administration support. The Government \nwill contribute $100,000 equivalent to provide office accommodation, counterpart staff support, \nfacilities for seminars and meetings, and other administrative expenses. Details of the cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  Executing Agency. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency. The \nthematic  committee,  in  consultation  with  the  high-level  advisory  committee  and  executive \ncommittee, will identify the implementing agencies. The high-level advisory committee chaired \nby the vice chair of the National Planning Commission will be formed to provide strategic \nguidance, monitor TA progress, and take all necessary actions to facilitate TA implementation. \nThe  committee  will  comprise  the  National  Planning  Commission  member  responsible  for \nmacroeconomic policies, secretary of MOF, secretary of the National Planning Commission, \ngovernor  of  Nepal  Rastra  Bank,  representatives  of  the  private  sector  and  policy  research \ninstitutions, and individual experts. Private sector representatives will make up at least half of \nthe  committee.  An  executive  committee  chaired  by  secretary,  MOF  and  comprised  of \nsecretaries from the line agencies representing the thematic clusters and Nepal Rastra Bank, \nwill also be formed to undertake the TA implementation. The implementation arrangements will \nbe reviewed during implementation to provide flexibility and ensure smooth implementation. \n \n13.  Thematic Committee. A thematic committee will be formed for each theme comprising \nsenior experts from the public and private sectors. The committees will be responsible for \nidentifying sector-specific policy issues, preparing work plans, and engaging in policy dialogue \nwith the stakeholders. The committee will select individuals and policy research institutions in \nNepal on a competitive basis to undertake policy research activities on identified policy issues. \nThe committee will be supported by a thematic expert who will help solicit and evaluate the \nproposals, and prepare terms of reference for the specific expertise required to undertake \nresearch and analysis. \n \n14.  Focal Unit. The economic analysis and policy affairs division of MOF will serve as the \nfocal unit of the network. The focal unit will (i) support all activities related to the thematic \ncommittees, (ii) assist in building capacity, (iii) arrange for peer review and public discourse, \n ", "                                                                                   5                         \n   \n(iv) maintain and update the web portal and disseminate information, and (v) consolidate \nprogress reports for the committees and disburse funds. The focal unit will be shifted to the \nproposed institution after its establishment. \n \n15.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  24  months  from  March  2008  to  February  2010. \nTripartite meetings of the Government, TA consultants, and ADB will be chaired by the MOF \nsecretary and held semiannually or as and when needed to review TA implementation priorities, \naddress issues arising during TA implementation, and provide guidance to the TA consultants. \nThe high-level advisory committee and executive committee will meet at the beginning of the TA \nand every 4 months thereafter to guide the TA and resolve policy and implementation issues. \nThe thematic committees will meet once every 2 months to sustain the momentum of the policy \nresearch agenda.  \n \n16.  Consulting Services. Three person-months of international and 68 person-months of \nnational consulting services will be provided during the TA. The consultants will be recruited \nthrough a firm using the quality- and cost-based system in accordance with ADB's Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time); the distribution of weights to \ntechnical  and  financial  proposals  will  be  80:20.  The  team  leader,  institutional  specialist, \nthematic specialists, and information dissemination specialist will be recruited at the beginning \nof  the  TA.  The  remaining  pool  of  consultants  will  be  selected  after  the  policy  issues  are \nidentified by the thematic committees. National consultants will be required to prepare policy \npapers on the issues assigned by the team leader under the guidance of the steering and \nthematic committees. Outline terms of reference for the consulting services are attached in \nAppendix  3.  Limited  equipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time), and will be handed over to the Government \non completion. \n \n17.  The team leader will submit an inception report including a detailed work program for the \nTA to the focal unit, high-level advisory committee, executive committee, and ADB within 30 \ndays of commencement of the TA.
