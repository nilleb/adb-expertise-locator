Water is central to human existence. It is also a key factor in reducing poverty, improving \nlivelihoods, and promoting economic growth. Authority for managing the world's fresh water \nresources is  fragmented  among  the  world's  nations,  hundreds  of  thousands  of  local \ngovernments,  and  countless  nongovernment  and  private  organizations,  as  well  as  a  large \nnumber of international bodies. Management issues have been subjected to numerous studies \nand  debates,  particularly  the  world  water  forums  (WWFs)  organized  by  the  World  Water \nCouncil. \n \n2.  ADB participated in the last three WWFs held in the Netherlands (2000), Japan (2003), \nand Mexico (2006) and made significant contributions at the last two.1 At the third WWF in \nJapan, ADB announced several partnerships, including the Water for Asian Cities Program. At \nthe fourth WWF in Mexico, ADB announced the Water Financing Program (WFP) 2006\u20132010.2 \nThe WFP will guide ADB in responding more effectively to the Asia and Pacific region\u2019s critical \nwater investment needs and double ADB\u2019s investment in water operations for 2006\u20132010.3  \n \n3.  At the fourth WWF, the Japan Water Forum (JWF) and five subregional coordinators \n(Korea Water Forum, Global Water Partnership [GWP] South East Asia, GWP South Asia, GWP \nCentral Asia, and the Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission) reported on the progress \nand formidable water-related challenges in the Asia and Pacific region and proposed that an \nAsia-Pacific Water Forum (APWF) be established.4 A ministerial declaration at the fourth WWF \nestablished the APWF as an independent, not-for-profit, non-partisan, and non-political network. \nThe APWF was launched at ADB on 27 September 2006, during a WFP conference. JWF will \nserve as the secretariat. This proposed regional technical assistance (TA) will support ADB\u2019s \ncontribution to the APWF for two years (2007\u20132008). The TA design and monitoring framework \nis in Appendix 1.5  Background information on the APWF is in Appendix 2. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The Asia and Pacific region has done better than other parts of the developing world in \nimproving access to and management of water. However, rapid population growth, urbanization, \nand the underperformance of existing water assets mean there is a large shortfall in meeting the \nregion\u2019s needs. In 2005, about 700 million people in the region were still without safe water \nsupplies and some 2 billion had inadequate or no toilet facilities.  \n                                                 \n1  See http://www.worldwatercouncil.org/ for more information on the World Water Council, established in 1996, and \nthe world water forums. For information on ADB\u2019s role at the third WWF, see: \nhttp://www.adb.org/Water/3WWF/ADB_role.asp. For follow-up actions see: \nhttp://www.adb.org/Water/3WWF/Default.asp. For ADB\u2019s presence at the fourth WWF see:  \nhttp://www.adb.org/Documents/Events/2006/4WWF/default.asp.  \n2  The joint ADB-UNHABITAT Water for Asian Cities Program, (http://www.adb.org/Water/3WWF/asian_cities.asp) \nwas set up to support the expansion of water infrastructure in Asian cities. As of June 2006, the program had \nexceeded its targets. The Water Financing Program  (http://www.adb.org/water/Operations/WFP/default.asp) aims \nto double ADB investments in water infrastructure to over $2 billion annually during the period 2006\u20132010. \n3  WFP also draws on the recommendations of the review of the implementation of ADB\u2019s water policy in 2005, and \nthe work of the Gurria Water Financing Task Force for the  fourth WWF in March 2006 in Mexico.  \n4  See: www.apwf.org. During the ministerial meeting that led to the joint declaration, the establishment of the APWF \nwas also supported by several development agencies in the region, including ADB, United Nations Economic and \nSocial Commission for Asia and the Pacific, Japan Bank for International Cooperation , Mekong River Commission, \nFood and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, United Nations Development Programme, United Nations \nEnvironment  Programme,  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural  Organization,  United  Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund, United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, and  World Conservation Union.   \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 2 January 2007.  \n ", "2   \n5.  Investments to provide people with safe drinking water and decent sanitation facilities, to \nallocate  and  preserve  water  resources,  and  to  manage  wastewater  properly  have  fallen \nseriously behind demands. The Asia Water Watch 2015 study, commissioned by ADB, World \nHealth Organization (WHO), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and United \nNations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), estimated that \nannual investments of at least $8 billion will be needed in the Asia and Pacific region over the \nnext decade if countries are to meet Millennium Development Goal (MDG) targets for safe \ndrinking water and sanitation.6   \n \n6.  Significant investments are also needed in irrigation services, river basin management, \nflood management and mitigation, and wastewater management. Investments in water are \ncrucial  to meet  the  broader  MDG  targets  of  reducing poverty,  hunger,  child and  maternal \nmortality and the incidence of major diseases, and to improve environmental sustainability. \nClearly, this is a major challenge, and one that is complicated by a wide range of governance, \ninstitutional, social, environmental and political issues. There is also a need to drastically reduce \nthe vulnerability of human populations to water-related disasters.7  \n \n7.  In calling for the creation of the APWF, the region\u2019s water ministers sought to establish \nan  effective  mechanism  to  encourage  more  collaborative  efforts  on  financing  water \ninfrastructure and to accelerate the effective integration of water resource management into the \nsocioeconomic development processes of the region. The ministerial meeting in March 2006 \nalso called upon the APWF to organize Asia-Pacific water summits (APWSs) once every 2 or \n3 years.  It was agreed that first summit would be held in Japan in 2007.8  \n \n8.  Since 2001, as part of the activities supported by the Cooperation Fund for the Water \nSector (CFWS),9 ADB has produced, among others, publications on water and poverty, the \nperformance of utilities, comprehensive analyses of water sector reforms, and sector road maps \nfor developing member countries (DMCs); papers on dams and water for all; a multimedia toolkit \non sanitation; and model terms of reference on water supply and sanitation.10 In keeping with its \nreputation as an authoritative source of knowledge about the water sector in the region, ADB \nalso  supports  its  DMCs  to  prepare  water  sector  reviews  and  sector  road  maps.  ADB\u2019s \nknowledge products on the water sector are among the most downloaded documents from its \nwebsite. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will promote sustainable water management policies and practices in the Asia \nand Pacific region by establishing a common platform for advancing strategies for solving water \nproblems. The TA will also support major regional events, including the first APWS, which will \nbring together leaders of governments, the private sector, and civil society. It will showcase \n                                                 \n6  ADB.  2006.  Asia  Water  Watch  2015.  Available:  http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Asia-Water-\nWatch/default.asp  \n7  The Asia and Pacific region accounted for 91% of the world\u2019s total deaths due to natural disasters and 49% of the \nworld\u2019s total damage due to natural disasters in the last century. \n8  At the APWF launch, JWF, the APWF secretariat, announced that the first APWS would be held in Beppu city, Oita \nprefecture, Japan, in December 2007. \n9  Five RETA projects were approved for a total of $18.1 million during the period 2001-2006. \n10 The  knowledge  products  are  available  online  at  the  Water  for  All  website:  http://www.adb.org/Water/ \nOperations/Knowledge-Capacity/default.asp  \n ", "  3\nleadership in decision-making, excellence in practice and innovation, and concrete results at the \ngrassroots level.  \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will deliver two outputs: (i) the Asian Water and Development Outlook (AWDO), \nand (ii) regional events, including the first APWS in Japan in 2007. \n \n11.  AWDO. Under the TA, ADB, in its capacity as the lead institution for boosting water \nfinancing and increasing public outreach, will commission a flagship report, the AWDO. The \nAWDO will draw on ADB's Asian Development Outlook, Asian Environmental Outlook, UNDP's \nHuman Development Report, and publications by Transparency International, among others. \nThe  AWDO  will  directly  target  senior  government  officials  involved  in  making  investment \ndecisions (principally finance and planning ministers and their advisers). It will showcase good \npractices that have helped overcome challenges. It will include background analytical papers on \nissues affecting the priorities for the water sector and boosting water investments; an overview \nof the water sector in the region; and country profiles containing analysis and statistics on key \nwater sector indicators.  \n \n12.  In addition to showing progress in countries, the AWDO will introduce one or more new \nindicators  to  track  country  leadership  and  results  in  water  governance  that  will  affect \ninvestments, reforms, and capacity development. The AWDO will stimulate government leaders \nto champion a water agenda for their countries. It will articulate the overall directions for water \nactivities that will be promoted by APWF in the coming years. The AWDO will be presented at \nthe  first  APWS,  with  a  declaration  by  the  leaders  supporting  the  key  messages  and \nrecommendations in the AWDO.11 The packaging of the document will take into account the \ntime constraints of the target audience.   \n \n13.  First APWS. The Government of Japan will host the first APWS in Beppu City, Oita \nPrefecture, with cabinet approval. APWF and a ministerial-level steering committee consisting of \neminent persons from Japan and other countries in the region will be responsible for organizing \nthe first APWS. The primary objective of the APWS is to create an opportunity for the political \nleaders of the region to commit to address the water issues that will affect achieving the MDGs.  \nEach APWS will target heads of governments and ministers of finance and planning, as well as \nleaders from the private sector, local governments, civil society, and media in the region,12 with \na view to moving water to the top of countries\u2019 political agendas. \n \n14.  The first APWS will help leaders from the region, and partner organizations, to tap into \nnew sources of finance and to develop innovative financial mechanisms. The TA will support the \nparticipation of leaders from over 40  DMCs at the first APWS.13 Leaders will be encouraged to \nshowcase  tangible  results,  reflected  in  greater  water  investments,  the  adoption  and \n                                                 \n11 The AWDO will try to communicate a maximum of three messages.  It explicitly convey what it wants leaders and \ndecision makers to do and when. \n12 There  are  47  target  countries:  Afghanistan,  Armenia,  Australia,  Azerbaijan,  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Brunei \nDarussalam, Cambodia, People's Republic of China, Fiji Islands, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Japan, \nKazakhstan, Kiribati, Republic of Korea, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Maldives, \nMarshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Nauru, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, \nPalau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Thailand, \nTimor-Leste, Tonga, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, and Viet Nam.  \n13 JWF will contribute $2,000,000 equivalent on a parallel basis to support the first APWS. \n ", "4   \nimplementation of strategic reforms, improved water governance at all levels, and significant \nprogress toward the MDGs.   \n \n15.  The first APWS will focus on the priority themes of the APWF: water financing, water-\nrelated disaster management, and water for development and ecosystems. Under the activities \nsupported by the CFWS, ADB will also produce knowledge products on issues, lessons learned, \nand a strategic approach for the way forward that will help to prepare recommendations on \nwater financing. It will aim to rally political support and institutional frameworks to finance water-\nrelated infrastructure and capacity development.  \n \n16.  As with other lead institutions, ADB will make in-kind contributions to the APWF through \ncomplementary activities funded by the CFWS.14 With support from CFWS, ADB will prepare \nsuccess stories for the media on how water infrastructure investments in the region, including \nADB-supported projects, have resulted in poverty reduction and economic growth, which in turn \nhas translated into a better lifestyle and opportunities for the people. These stories will be \npresented to attract the attention of leaders and policy makers, as well as the media.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan.15  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. ADB\u2019s Energy, Transport, and Water \nDivision of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD) will implement the \nTA, in cooperation with ADB\u2019s operations departments; the Department of External Relations; \nthe Water Committee; JWF; and lead institutions of the APWF.  \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 24 months, starting in April 2007 and \nending in March 2009. The services of a media coordinator (international consultant, 2 person-\nmonths will be required to support the preparation and implementation of a strategy to promote \nthe first APWS. The services of a water sector expert (national consultant, 8 person-months) will \nbe needed in ADB headquarters for day-to-day coordination of TA activities. The TA will also \nsupport the APWF Governing Council and the Steering Committee for the first APWS. \n \n20.  AWDO will be prepared by a dedicated team of international and national consultants, \nled  by  an  international  water  sector  expert,  working  in  close  coordination  with  a  panel  of \nresource persons. All consultants and resource persons will be engaged as individuals by ADB \nin accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to \ntime).  Procurement  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2006,  as \namended from time to time).

Goal and Objectives of the APWF. The Asia-Pacific Water Forum (APWF) aims to \ncontribute  to  sustainable  water  management  and  the  achievement  of  the  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) in Asia. Its objectives are: (i) to provide countries and organizations \nin the region with a common platform for articulating strategies and promoting achievements in \nsolving water problems, including meeting the necessary investment requirements; and (ii) to \nshowcase leadership in decision-making, excellence in practice and innovation, and results that \nhave had a substantial impact at the grassroots level. \n  \n2.  Priority Themes and Key Result Areas of APWF.  In order to meet its objectives, the \nAPWF  will  have  three  priority  themes:  (i)  water  financing,  (ii)  disaster  management,  and \n(iii) water for development and ecosystems.  Progress on each priority theme will be presented \nat the Asia-Pacific water summits.  APWF will work on five key result areas (KRAs), each of \nwhich will encompass a specific set of related activities. The KRAs are essentially the means \nthrough which the APWF will achieve progress toward meeting the targets in each of the three \npriority themes.

Water Financing. The Asia and Pacific region is expected to experience unprecedented \neconomic development over the coming decades.  This, combined with population growth, is \nlikely to increase pressure on already stressed water resources.  However, if supported by \npolitical will and institutional frameworks, this anticipated growth can provide opportunities for \nfinancing water-related infrastructure and human capacity development.   \n \n4.  In less developed countries where the need for new infrastructure is greatest, additional \ninvestments  will  be  required  for  education  to  improve  operation  and  maintenance  and  to \nenhance existing infrastructure. Investments in new infrastructure need to be combined with \nincreased investments in education so the value of the new infrastructure is maximized. \n \n5.  Greater efforts will need to be made to attract new funding sources and to develop \ninnovative financial mechanisms.  Priority should be given to programs that invest in capacity \ndevelopment for people and institutions and build self-reliance.   \n \n6.   Disaster Management. Between 2001 and 2005, an average of over 62,000 people \nwere killed every year by water-related disasters in the Asia and Pacific region. Vulnerability to \nwater-related disasters remains high across the region, from flash floods and landslides in \nmountainous areas to monsoon-related flooding in deltas. The plea from the Hyogo Framework \nfor Action 2005\u20132015,2 to halve the number of deaths caused by water-related disasters, may \nbe used as a target for the region.  \n \n7.  Enhancing preparedness through better early warning systems, stronger regional co-\noperation, and more awareness and community involvement are central to addressing this \npriority theme.  The increasing risks that climate change poses, especially in coastal urban \nareas, make the need for action all the more urgent.  Small island states, especially in the \nPacific, are highly vulnerable to climate extremes and variability. Pre-emptive efforts are needed \nto build resilience within communities and to protect the livelihoods of the most vulnerable, \nespecially women and children. \n \n8.  APWF will look beyond coping with hazards and will also pay attention to reducing \nvulnerability.  The key to reducing vulnerability lies in increasing preparedness through pre-\nemptive activities, such as early warning systems, raising awareness and evacuation planning.   \n \n                                                 \n2  Adopted at the ninth plenary meeting of the World Conference on Disaster Reduction. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n9.  Water  for  Development  and  Ecosystems.  Healthy  aquatic  ecosystems  provide \ntangible economic and social benefits.  Protecting zones at the land\u2013water interface such as \nmangroves, paddy fields, wetlands, and forests not only increases ecosystem health, but may \nprovide extra protection against disasters and saline intrusion, help groundwater recharging, \nand improve the overall quality of life. \n \n10.  In  the  Asia  and  Pacific  region,  the  importance  of  \u201cnatural  water\u201d  as  part  of  the \nenvironment has been embraced by many cultures.  Unfortunately, modernization has resulted \nin far too many water courses being dramatically \u201cdenaturalized\u201d.  Surface water restoration is \nnot only good for the environment and the integrity of the water resources, it can have tangible \nsocial benefits as well, including reducing flood vulnerability and increasing the overall quality of \nlife by providing people who live in or frequent the area with new areas of natural beauty for \nrecreation and relaxation. \n \n11.  Governance Structure of APWF. The proposed governance structure for the APWF \nconsists of: (i) president and advisers; (ii) governing council consisting of a chair and two vice-\nchairs;  (iii)  subregional  coordinators;  (iv)  lead  organizations  for  priority  themes  and  KRAs; \n(v) member organizations; and (vi) a secretariat.  The intent is to have a light managerial and \nadministrative set-up responsible for coordinating APWF activities, including the organization of \nthe Asia-Pacific Water Summits.     \n \n12.  The  subregional  coordinators  are  the  organizations  in  the  five  subregions 3   that \nrepresented Asia and the Pacific during the preparatory process leading up to the fourth WWF \nand prepared the regional document that led to the ministerial declaration and, ultimately, to the \ncreation of the APWF. Like the subregional coordinators, the lead organizations have agreed to \noperate on a voluntary basis and have expressed their willingness to commit the resources \nnecessary to cover their active participation.  They are also part of a wide network of local \npractitioners, with access to decision-makers, and are thus able to build links between the \ngrassroots and governmental levels. \n \n13.  Asia-Pacific Water Summits.  At the fourth WWF the ministerial meeting also called on \nthe APWF to organize Asia-Pacific water summits once every 2 or 3 years.  It was agreed that \nfirst summit would be held in Japan in 2007.  Succeeding summits will be organized in countries \nof Asia and the Pacific region, depending upon proposals received.   \n \n14.  The first summit in Japan will be held in Beppu City, Oita Prefecture on 3\u20134 December \n2007. The Government of Japan will support the summit. The organizers are the Asia-Pacific \nWater Forum and the steering committee of the first Asia-Pacific Water Summit, consisting of \neminent persons from Japan and other countries in the region. \n \n                                                 \n3  The five subregions are Central Asia and Caucasus, Northeast Asia, Pacific, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) Financinga  \n     1.
