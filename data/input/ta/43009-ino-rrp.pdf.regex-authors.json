Public Expenditure Support Facility Problem Tree  76 \n \n ", " \nLOAN AND PROGRAM SUMMARY \n \nBorrower  Republic of Indonesia \n   \nThe Proposal  The  proposal  includes  a  loan  of  $1,000,000,000  under  the  Public \nExpenditure Support Facility Program. \n   \nClassification  Targeting Classification: General intervention \nSector: Public sector management \nSubsectors: Economic management and management of public affairs; \npublic expenditure and fiscal management \nThemes: Economic growth; governance; private sector development \nSubthemes: Promoting macroeconomic stability; public administration \n(national and decentralized); private sector investment \n   \nEnvironment  Category C       \nAssessment \n   \nThe Program  The  global  turmoil  in  financial  markets  since  September  2008  has \nRationale  adversely  and  significantly  affected  Indonesia\u2019s  economy  since  the \nfourth  quarter  (Q4)  of  2008  in  three  ways:  (i)  balance  sheet \ndeleveraging in the United States (US) caused investors to unbundle \nfinancial  portfolios  in  Indonesia,  leading  to  some  capital  flight  in \nOctober 2008; (ii) the global credit crunch and elevated banking sector \nrisk have made it expensive for Indonesia to access international debt \nmarkets, both for the public and private sectors, including accessing \ntrade finance; and (iii) the second round effects of the global financial \ncrash on the real sector have resulted in a severe and broad-based \neconomic recession in several of Indonesia\u2019s major trading partners, \naffecting demand for Indonesian exports and investment inflows. These \neffects are manifested in a number of forms: (i) the Indonesian stock \nmarket declined by 31% during October 2008; (ii) yields on medium-\nterm  domestic  bonds  increased  by  nearly  400  basis  points; \n(iii) Indonesia\u2019s international bond spreads surged by about 650 basis \npoints; (iv) the rupiah exchange rate depreciated by 17% against the \nUS dollar; and (v) exports contracted in February by 33%, the first time \nin several years. \nWhile the direct effect of the global crisis on the banking system in \nIndonesia has been limited because of lack of direct investment in \ntroubled US assets, liquidity in the banking system has been very tight \nsince  September  2008.  The  yields  on  Indonesian  domestic  bonds \nremained elevated and rose more sharply than elsewhere in Southeast \nAsia since October 2008. Government finances have been especially \nvulnerable to spikes in global risk aversion and contagion from external \nmarkets because of the country\u2019s large gross financing needs and the \nneed for a fiscal stimulus. The term structure of Indonesia\u2019s bonds led \nto sharply higher debt issuances in 2007 and 2008, and amortization is \nprojected to remain at high levels through 2011. During normal market \nconditions,  Indonesia  was  able  to  raise  more  than  $12  billion  from \ndomestic and international markets in both 2007 and 2008. However, \n ", "iiii  \ntighter global liquidity and higher risk premiums combined with high \ngross financing needs have raised interest rates on Indonesian debt \ncompared with other economies in the region. With prohibitive yields on \nrupiah and US dollar bonds, the Government could not access funds \nfrom the credit markets in Q4 2008\u2014raising concerns about possible \nbudget financing constraints in 2009. Liquidity in the credit markets has \neased  since  January  2009,  allowing  the  Government  to  access \ndomestic  resources  although  at  a  higher  cost  than  under  normal \nconditions.  \nIn  January  2009,  the  Government  revised  its  budget  to  reflect  the \ndeteriorating  external  environment  and  the  need  to  provide  fiscal \nstimulus.  As  a  result,  Indonesia\u2019s  2009  budget  deficit  has  been \nincreased from 1.0% of gross domestic product (GDP) to 2.5%, and \ngross financing needs from Rp171.4 trillion to Rp270.7 trillion.   \n  In  this  context,  the  Government  requested  the  World  Bank,  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), and other development partners to provide a \nPublic  Expenditure  Support  Facility  (PESF).  The  Government  has \nstated  that  it  intends  to  access  the  facility  only  under  certain \ncircumstances set out in its financing plan, such as in the event of \nrenewed difficulties in accessing credit markets as occurred in Q4 2008 \n(i.e., a contingent loan).  \n \nUnder the PESF Program, the Government will implement a series of \nconfidence-boosting  policy  measures  aimed  at  sending  a  strong \npositive signal to the markets, making it more likely that Indonesia will \nmeet its commercial market borrowing targets for 2009. These policy \nmeasures address the increased short-term vulnerabilities and risks to \nthe  Indonesian  economy  from  the  global  financial  crisis  and  sharp \nslowdown in the global economy, and underpin the key priorities of the \nGovernment\u2019s  reform  agenda.  These  measures  include  actions  to \n(i) reassure financial markets and maintain financial system stability, \n(ii) sustain  critical  public  expenditures  while  maintaining  budget \ndiscipline to mitigate the poverty impacts of the growth slowdown, and \n(iii) crowd in private investment and support exports.  \n \nThe PESF is part of a joint effort of the World Bank, ADB, Government \nof Australia, and Government of Japan to support a common crisis-\nmitigating action agenda with the Government, and provide contingent \nbudget financing in the event of further instability in credit markets that \nmay  result  in  a  shortfall  in  budget  financing  needs.  The  PESF \ncomplements the World Bank\u2019s Development Policy Loan and ADB\u2019s \nDevelopment  Policy  Support  Program  series,  which  reflect  the \nGovernment\u2019s commitment to reforms over the medium term. \n \nUnder the best case scenario where the Government meets all of its \nfinancing  targets  from  market  sources,  in  which  global  financial \nconditions do not deteriorate substantially and approval of the PESF \nsends a strong positive market signal, no withdrawal would be expected \nunder the PESF. Under a second scenario, in which market conditions \n ", "  iii \nremain tight and the drawdown triggers set out in the financing plan are \nmet, the Government may exercise its options to access the PESF \nfunds. Under a third scenario, in which there is a sharp deterioration in \nglobal financial markets, creating macroeconomic instability and/or a \nbalance-of-payments crisis, the PESF is unlikely to be effective and \nIndonesia will needs crisis mitigation support. \n   \nImpact and  The PESF will (i) support the Government\u2019s efforts to mobilize funds \nOutcome  from commercial markets by capitalizing on the expected confidence \ncreated by the PESF support package, and (ii) serve as a precautionary \nmeasure  to  provide  additional  financing  to  the  Government  for  the \nlarger fiscal stimulus now needed. The policy actions are designed to \naccomplish the following:  \n \n(i)  Reassure  financial  markets  and  maintain  financial \nsystem stability by enhancing the financial safety net; \nmaintain  stability  of  the  banking  system;  and  ensure \npredictability in the Government\u2019s financing requirements \nfor 2009 and 2010.  \n(ii)  Sustain  critical  public  expenditures  while  maintaining \nbudget discipline to mitigate the poverty impacts of the \ngrowth slowdown through strengthening coordination of \nnational poverty reduction efforts; establishing a national \npoverty monitoring and response system; and increasing \ncritical public expenditures in poverty alleviation, social \nprotection,  and  infrastructure  maintenance  and \ndevelopment. This will be done by undertaking actions to \nspeed up budget disbursement, by improving efficiency \nin  budget  disbursements,  promoting  advance \nprocurement, and carrying over unspent cash from the \n2008 budget. \n(iii)  Crowd  in  private  investment  and  support  exports  by \nrevising the implementing decree for the new investment \nlaw, improving transparency in revenues from extractive \nindustries, and enhancing access to trade finance. \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $1,000,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will be \nprovided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based \nlending facility for the PESF Program. The loan will have a 15-year term \nincluding  a  grace  period  of  3  years,  an interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft program loan agreement.   \n   \nPeriod and  The PESF program period will be from 1 September 2008, when the \nTranching  global  financial  crisis  erupted,  to  31  December  2010,  with  a  single \ntranche loan of $1,000,000,000 to be disbursed in phased withdrawals \nwhen the Government has met the policy actions set out in the policy \nmatrix and the drawdown triggers set out in its financing plan.  \n   \nCounterpart Funds  The  Government  will  use  the  local  currency  counterpart  funds \ngenerated by the loan proceeds to meet program expenditures and \n ", "iivv  \nassociated  costs  of  reforms,  and  to  help  maintain  current  social \nexpenditure and infrastructure spending. \n   \nExecuting Agency   Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA)  \n   \nImplementation  The Ministry of Finance (MOF), Ministry of Trade (MOT), Coordinating \nArrangements  Ministry for Social Welfare (CMSW), and National Development and \nPlanning Agency (BAPPENAS) are the Implementing Agencies. CMEA, \nas  the  Executing  Agency,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  program \nimplementation activities and coordination and reporting to ADB; it will \nbe supported by the Implementing Agencies (MOF, MOT, CMSW, and \nBAPPENAS).  The  Government  has  established  a  program  steering \ncommittee to implement the Government\u2019s financing plan, chaired by \nthe  director  general  of  the  Debt  Management  Office  (MOF),  and \ncomprising representatives from CMEA, MOF, and BAPPENAS, and \nrepresentatives of each development partner cofinancing the PESF. \nThe program steering committee will meet in the first week of each \nquarter to review implementation of the financing plan and determine \nthe Government\u2019s financing shortfalls. CMEA will be responsible for \nday-to-day  program  implementation  activities,  and  will  report  on \nimplementation progress. \n   \nProcurement and  The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange \nDisbursement  costs (excluding local duties and taxes) of items produced and procured \nin  ADB  member  countries,  excluding  ineligible  items  and  imports \nfinanced by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The loan proceeds \nwill be disbursed to the Borrower in accordance with the provisions of \nADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and  Related \nRequirements for Program Loans. \n   \nProgram Benefits  The PESF will provide significant benefits and have a positive impact \nand Beneficiaries  on the Government\u2019s fiscal situation as it will do the following:  \n \n(i)  Allow  the  Government  to  mobilize  resources  from \ncommercial  markets  by  capitalizing  on  the  expected \nconfidence  created  by  the  PESF  support  package  by \nreassuring  financial  markets  and  maintaining  financial \nsystem stability, thereby reducing the Government\u2019s cost \nof borrowing from the market.  \n(ii)  Ensure  that  the  Government  can  meet  its  financing \nrequirements  of  its  fiscal  budget  and  any  additional \nstimulus required if the economic slowdown is sharper \nthan expected. \n(iii)  Ensure that the Government can maintain its momentum \ntoward  achieving  its  medium-term  development \nobjectives while managing the negative impacts of the \ninternational  credit  crunch  on  Indonesia\u2019s  access  to \ncredit  markets  and  the  economic  slowdown  by \n(a) reassuring financial markets and maintaining financial \nsystem stability, (b) mitigating the poverty impacts of the \ngrowth  slowdown,  (c)  sustaining  critical  public \n ", "  v \nexpenditures  while  maintaining  budget  discipline,  and \n(d) crowding  in  private  investment  and  supporting \nexports. \n \n   \nRisks and  The  PESF  is  firmly  embedded  in  the  Government\u2019s  Medium  Term \nAssumptions  Development Plan 2004\u22122009 and complements ADB\u2019s Development \nPolicy Support Program loan series, cofinanced with the World Bank. \nThe assumptions underlying the PESF include the following:  \n  \n(i)  Continued  strong  commitment  for  reforms  supported  by \nWorld  Bank  and  ADB  Development  Policy  Support \nProgram series. \n(ii)  The global economy stabilizes from the financial crisis.  \n \nHowever, the PESF has risks: \n \n(i)  External vulnerabilities. The external risks remain high, \nespecially during a period of global financial turmoil and \nuncertainty and the ongoing international credit crunch, as \nwell  as  the  emerging  second  round  effects  of  a  sharp \neconomic  slowdown.  Indonesia  is  a  financially  open \neconomy  and  there  are  significant  foreign  holdings, \nespecially  in  the  stock  market  and  government  bonds. \nIndonesia continues to be vulnerable to shifts in investor \nliquidity needs, as deleveraging proceeds in North America \nand Europe. If significant funds are pulled back because of \nliquidity  demands  by  investors  in  these  areas  and/or \nincreased emerging market risk aversion, this could lead to \nincreased  pressure  on  international  reserves  and/or \nexchange rates, as well as on the domestic money market. \nIn  addition,  the  Government  has  large  gross  financing \nneeds over the next few years, and tighter credit markets \nand increased risk aversion could severely limit its ability to \ntap  international  financial  markets.  This  could  force  the \nGovernment  to  cut  budgetary  outlays  to  maintain  fiscal \nbalance even after full access to the PESF, with adverse \nconsequences  for  infrastructure  and  social  expenditure. \nMitigating  these  risks  will  require  solid  cooperation \nbetween the central bank and the economic ministries to \nreassure bondholders that their investments are safe while \nenhancing  efforts  to  crowd  in  private  investment  to  the \nextent  possible  through  the  reforms  supported  by  the \nPESF. \n(ii)  Sharp economic slowdown. The Government revised its \ngrowth projection from 6.0% to 5.0% in January and again \nto 4.5% in March 2009 as the economy deteriorated. The \ngrowth projections are likely to be revised downward as \nmore evidence emerges of the magnitude of the global \neconomic  slowdown  over  the  next  several  weeks.  This \nwould  affect  revenue  collections  and  require  further \n ", "vvii  \nrevisions to the 2009 budget and financing plan. The PESF \nprovides  fiscal  flexibility  by  providing  for  further  fiscal \nexpansion as allowed for in the agreed financing plan.  \n(iii)  Fiduciary constraints. Notwithstanding the improvements \nunder  way,  there  are  continuing  concerns  regarding \nutilization  of  public  resources.  The  overall  fiduciary \nassessments  undertaken  since  2001  (with  the  Country \nFinancial  Accountability  Assessment)  have  indicated \nconsiderable improvements in the fiduciary environment in \nIndonesia (Appendix 8). Ongoing programs supported by \nseveral development partners provide significant technical \nassistance  support  to  strengthen  fiduciary  governance. \nThe  PESF  inclusion  of  strengthening  budgetary \nprocedures  and  controls,  accompanied  by  increased \ntransparency  in  financial  management,  will  significantly \nenhance transparency. \n(iv)  Legislative  and  presidential  elections  in  2009.  The \nGovernment remains committed to sustaining its economic \nreform agenda despite the global economic recession, the \ninternational  credit  crunch,  and  general  elections  next \nyear.  Unfortunately,  elections  often  reduce  the  time \nhorizons of politicians, leading them to avoid new policy \ninitiatives in the pre-election period and   shifting their \nfocus  to  populist  short-term  measures.  This  could \nundermine  the  reform  agenda  supported  by  the  PESF. \nConversely, the prospect of elections could spur political \naction into ensuring that critical government expenditures \nand accompanying reforms are undertaken to demonstrate \na  continued  and  clear  record  of  accomplishments.  The \nProgram guards against reversals in the policy actions by \nlinking  scheduled  withdrawals  of  the  loan  amount  to \nmaintaining the program measures and broad objectives \nintact. \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nfor $1,000,000,000 to the Republic of Indonesia under the Public Expenditure Support Facility \nProgram. The program design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \nA.  The Request for a Public Expenditure Support Facility \n2.  The proposed Public Expenditure Support Facility (PESF) comes at a critical time for \nIndonesia and is designed to maintain the momentum of Indonesia\u2019s key development efforts at \na time of global financial market crisis and most likely the sharpest slowdown in the global \neconomy since World War II. Like many other developing economies, Indonesia has had to \ncope with the first round effects of the turmoil and crisis of confidence that have disrupted the \nglobal  financial  system  in  the  last  7  months  and  effectively  froze  Indonesia\u2019s  access  to \ncommercial  debt  markets  at  the  end  of  2008.  Coming  into  the  global  crisis,  Indonesia\u2019s \nmacroeconomic performance was impressive. The economy was expanding at about 6% in the \nfirst three quarters of 2008, its highest growth rate since the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998. \nThe primary budget has been in surplus for the last 3 years and its overall deficit for 2008 is \nestimated at 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) on the back of strong revenue growth and a \nreduction in fuel subsidies. Indonesia\u2019s debt\u2013GDP ratio continuously declined from 55% in 2004 \nto 35% in 2007, and dropped further to 33% by the end of 2008.  \n \n3.  The  global  turmoil  in  financial  markets  since  September  2008  has  adversely  and \nsignificantly affected Indonesia\u2019s financial markets from the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2008 until now \nin two ways: (i) balance sheet deleveraging in the United States (US) caused investors to \nunbundle financial portfolios in Indonesia, leading to some capital flight; and (ii) the global credit \ncrunch  has  made  it  expensive  for  both  Indonesia\u2019s  public  and  private  sector  to  access \ninternational debt markets. Indonesia is preparing for the second round effects of a sharp \nslowdown in global economic growth on its economy and potentially continued tight liquidity in \n2009. The economies of Indonesia\u2019s major trading partners have entered recession. Global \ntrade contracted in Q4 2008, the first time since 1982. Indonesia\u2019s export growth is expected to \nbe negative in the first half of 2009 because of the fall in global demand and commodity prices. \nIn addition, the global credit crisis has resulted in US dollar shortages that have affected the \ncost of trade financing and investment flows. There is now a consensus in the international \ncommunity  that  countries  should  operate  counter-cyclical  fiscal  and  monetary  policies  to \nmitigate the worst effects of the financial crisis on the real economy. With lessons learned from \nthe 1998 financial crisis, the Government has revised the 2009 budget to include a fiscal \nstimulus package of Rp73.2 trillion ($6.8 billion, 1.3% of GDP). As a result of these budget \nchanges, the 2009 budget deficit has been revised from 1.0% of GDP to 2.5%, and its gross \nfinancing requirements from Rp170.5 trillion to Rp271.4 trillion. The Government recognizes that \nadditional fiscal stimulus may be necessary if the domestic economy slows further in the coming \nmonths.   \n \n4.  In the context of the first round effects, the Government asked the World Bank in \nSeptember 2008 to provide a PESF of $2 billion and to facilitate financing of an additional \n$3 billion\u2013$4 billion from other development partners. The Government has stated it intends to \nexercise this financing only under certain circumstances set out in its financing plan, such as \ndifficulties in accessing credit markets (para. 8). The World Bank agreed, and shortly after \nSeptember  2008  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  Government  of  Australia,  and \n ", "2     \n \nGovernment  of  Japan  agreed  to  join  the  PESF.  The  request  for  financing  stemmed  from \nconcerns about Indonesia\u2019s ability to meet its gross financing needs\u2014which will be high in the \nnext 2 years because of the maturity structure and servicing costs of its existing debt\u2014if the \ncurrent  global  liquidity  crisis  does  not  ease  significantly  over  the  next  6\u201312  months.  The \nGovernment is also concerned about ensuring predictability in its budget financing, given the \nnecessity for a fiscal stimulus. Therefore, the PESF serves two purposes: (i) to encourage the \nGovernment  to  first  mobilize  resources  from  commercial  markets  by  capitalizing  on  the \nexpected confidence created by the PESF support; and (ii) to serve as a precautionary measure \nto provide additional financing to the Government for its larger fiscal stimulus in the event it can \nnot be fully funded from market financing. The Government believes that the announcement of a \nsupport package, backed up by a program of confidence-boosting policy measures, would send \na strong positive signal to the markets, making it more likely that Indonesia would meet its \ncommercial market borrowing targets for 2009.   \n \nB.  The Government and Its Development Strategy \n5.  The PESF supports the Government\u2019s development agenda as articulated in its Medium-\nTerm National Development Plan 2004\u20132009 (RPJM). The RPJM includes the eight medium-\nterm development goals that provide an overarching framework, placing human development \nand poverty reduction at the center of the development agenda. The Government\u2019s annual work \nplan (RKP), approved each year by the Cabinet, guides RPJM implementation. The RKP for \n2009 importantly revises the poverty target to 12%\u201314% from 15.4% in March 2008, given the \nintractable nature of poverty and the slow progress in defeating poverty until more inclusive \ngrowth had been developed during the last several years. As a consequence, the RKP for 2009 \ncontinues with the following three priority areas: (i) providing basic services and alleviating \npoverty by developing rural areas, focusing on education services, health and family planning, \nand rural infrastructure; (ii) accelerating and improving the quality of growth through enhanced \neconomic stability and resilience supported by the development of agriculture, infrastructure, \nand energy sectors; and (iii) enhancing anticorruption measures, including through bureaucracy \nreform.

The PESF complements ADB\u2019s existing loan programs to Indonesia, in particular the \nDPSP-4, which was approved by the ADB Board of Directors on 29 November 2008. The DPSP \nseries aims to advance Indonesia\u2019s longer-term institutional reform agenda and focuses on the \nmany important but often incremental steps that need to be taken to realize this long-term \nagenda (Appendix 8), whereas the PESF Program implements measures that deal with the \ncurrent situation. The PESF focuses on a subset of the policy areas covered under the DPSP \nplus some additional ones (financial sector stability, macroeconomic stability, and trade finance). \nThese are areas in which further policy action is important as part of a proactive response to the \nadverse current situation and likely future stresses, e.g., the need to take proactive steps to \nmaintain critical public expenditures and reassure investors given the current situation and the \npotential severity of the expected growth slowdown in 2009.  \n \nC.  The Government and its Development Partners \n7.  The PESF, structured as a single tranche loan with scheduled and multiple withdrawals \ncontingent on certain conditions set out under the Government\u2019s financing plan being met during \nthe program period, aims to help the Government continue to maintain its MDGs of higher \neconomic growth, lower unemployment, and reduction of poverty as articulated in its RKP\u2014at a \ncritical time of global financial market failure and recession, as highlighted in its development \npolicy letter (Appendix 2). To achieve the program goals, the PESF does the following: (i) it \nimplements a series of policy measures designed to boost market confidence in Indonesia\u2019s \nfinancial sector, improve budget efficiency, and mitigate the increased risks and vulnerabilities \nto the domestic economy\u2014to allow the Government to mobilize resources from commercial \nmarkets by capitalizing on the expected confidence created by the PESF support package; and \n(ii) with consensus from development partners, the Program supports the Government\u2019s larger \nfiscal stimulus.  \n  \n8.  Contingent  Program  Approach.  Key  features  of  the  PESF  include  \n(i) a single tranche loan with scheduled and multiple withdrawals; (ii) a small number of high-\nimpact policy measures designed to address the adverse impacts of the ongoing financial crisis \ncompleted  prior  to  consideration  by  the  Board;  (iii)  a  financing  plan  for  the  Government\u2019s \nprojected gross financing needs for 2009, including projected commercial borrowings in the \ndomestic and international markets; and (iv) withdrawals of the loan amount to be made when \nthe drawdown triggers set in the Government\u2019s financing plan are met (paras. 40\u201342) and the \npolicy measures introduced under the Program continue to remain in place. In this way, the \nPESF  Program  mirrors  features  of  the  World  Bank\u2019s  PESF  parallel  cofinancing  loan  of  a \ndevelopment policy loan with a deferred drawdown option whereby subsequent withdrawals of \nthe single tranche loan are contingent on the drawdown triggers set out in the financing plan \nbeing met. Under the best case scenario where the Government meets all of its financing \ntargets  from  market  sources,  in  which  the  global  financial  conditions  do  not  deteriorate \nsubstantially and approval of the PESF sends a strong positive market signal, no withdrawal \nwould be expected under the PESF. Under a second scenario, in which the market condition \nremains tight and the drawdown triggers set out in the financing plan are met, the Government \ncan exercise its options to access the PESF funds. Under a third scenario, in which there is a \nsharp deterioration in the global financial market creating macroeconomic instability and/or a \nbalance-of-payments crisis, the PESF is unlikely to be effective and Indonesia will need crisis \nmitigation support. \n  \n9.  Government and Development Partner Coordination. The PESF loan is a joint effort \nof the Government and development partners to support a common policy agenda and broad \nfinancing plan. The PESF reflects a proactive policy response by the Government to mitigate \n ", "  5\nthe increased vulnerabilities and risks to the Indonesian financial sector and domestic economy \nfrom  the  recent  global  turmoil  in  financial  markets,  as  well  as  development  partners\u2019 \ncommitment  to  provide  Indonesia  with  fiscal  resources  to  support  program  implementation \nincluding the financing plan. The PESF also reflects the Government\u2019s commitment to its longer-\nterm  reform  agenda,  both  within  and  outside  the  World  Bank\u2019s  DPL  series  and  ADB\u2019s \ncofinanced DPSP series, by helping to accelerate necessary reforms under the DPL/DPSP \nreform agenda. The Government\u2019s financing plan includes three lending modalities to address \ndifferent dimensions of the financial crisis on the Indonesian economy, while supporting a \ncommon set of objectives of the PESF as a contingent program. The modalities include (i) a \nnoncontingent program loan, (ii) a loan facility contingent on shortfalls in budget financing and \nwhen  the  drawdown  triggers  set  in  the  financing  plan  are  met,  and  (iii)  guarantees  of \nGovernment of Indonesia sovereign debt. Option (ii) aims to address financing shortfalls arising \nfrom difficulties in accessing international and domestic credit markets. Option (iii) is designed to \nenhance the Government\u2019s access to international bond markets, lower its interest costs, and \ndiversify its funding sources. The development partners are providing a mix of options (ii) and \n(iii).  The  World  Bank  approved  its  contingent  loan  of  $2.0  billion  on  3  March  2009,  the \nGovernment of Japan has approved $1.5 billion in a combination of loan guarantees and \ncontingent loans, ADB has proposed to provide a contingent loan of $1.0 billion, and the \nGovernment of Australia has committed to a contingent loan of $1.0 billion to the PESF (and is \ncurrently in the process of completing the legal requirement of its lending modality). \n \n10.  The PESF Program has a number of important features. First, it is fully based on the \nGovernment\u2019s reform agenda and this promotes full ownership. Second, the policy measures \nspecifically address the increased vulnerabilities and risks to the domestic economy emanating \nfrom the global financial turmoil based on lessons learned from the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial \ncrisis. In this way, it is not overloaded with reform measures but rather complements the \nDPSP/DPL series that focuses on a more comprehensive and longer-term institutional reform \nagenda. Third, the PESF encourages the Government to first access commercial markets for \nfinancing  by  embedding  the  Government\u2019s  financing  plan  in  the  PESF  Program,  including \ntargets for bond issuances. In this way, the PESF would not distort the Government\u2019s incentives \nto source financing from credit markets. At the same time, the PESF recognizes that the \nGovernment needs to conduct fiscal stimulus and it may be unrealistic for the Government to \nfinance the entire stimulus through commercial borrowings as this may crowd out Indonesian \ncorporations\u2019 commercial borrowings with an adverse impact on investment. Fourth, designed \nas a single tranche loan with scheduled withdrawals during the program period contingent on \nmeeting the withdrawal triggers set out in the Government\u2019s financing plan, it encourages \ncontinuous engagement by the development partners during the current adverse economic \nenvironment.  \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Recent Economic Developments and the Impacts of the Global Financial Crisis \n11.  Macroeconomic  Performance.  Indonesia  enjoyed  its  best  macroeconomic \nperformance in 2007 and 2008 (Appendix 4). Up until September 2008, it was able to withstand \nthe  negative  impacts  from  the  global  crisis  thanks  to  prudent  macroeconomic  policy,  a \nstrengthened financial sector, and protective levels of foreign exchange reserves (Table 1). \nEconomic growth accelerated to a 10-year high of 6.3% in 2007. Despite unstable global \nfinancial  markets  and  a  slowing  world  economy,  Indonesia  did  not  experience  a  growth \nslowdown in the first half of 2008 and economic growth remained respectable at 6.1% in Q3 \n2008. The overall budget deficit was low by international standards at 1.3% of GDP in 2007. \n ", "6     \n \nTotal tax revenues in the first 10 months of 2008 were about 50% higher than during the \nequivalent period in 2007 and this increase appears to be broadly based. This, with significant \nexpenditure adjustments to curb subsidies, reduced the budget deficit further to 0.1% of GDP in \n2008. With continued fiscal discipline, Indonesia has achieved the most dramatic decline in \ndebt\u2013GDP ratio of any major economy in Southeast Asia. Indonesia\u2019s debt\u2013GDP ratio declined \nsignificantly from 55% in 2004 to 35% in 2007 and dropped further to 33% by end of 2008. \nBalance of payments recorded a respectable surplus of 2.4% of GDP in 2007 and remained \nreasonably robust in the first half of 2008. Indonesia continued to accumulate foreign reserves \nthrough the first half of 2008, peaking at $60 billion in the middle of the year. \n \nTable 1: Key Macroeconomic Indicators for Indonesia, 2003\u20132008 \n  Fiscal Year \nItem  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008a \nA.

Inflation.  After  experiencing  double-digit  inflation  in  2005  and  2006,  inflation  in \nIndonesia fell to 6.4% in 2007. The unexpected surge in international food and energy prices \nearly in 2008 resulted in higher domestic inflation in 2008. Inflation peaked at 12% in Q3 2008 \nfollowing the tightening of monetary policy and falling commodity prices as the global economy \nstarted to show recessionary conditions. Inflation reached 11% at the end of 2008. ADB staff \n ", "  7\nforecasts for inflation suggest that it will decelerate in the first semester of 2009 owing to sharply \nlower commodity prices and falling domestic demand.  \n \n13.  Global Financial Crisis. The turmoil in financial markets intensified in September 2008 \nfollowing the failure of important financial institutions in the US, which froze interbank and credit \nmarkets around the world and pushed the price of risk upward, triggering a global liquidity \nshortage worldwide. One indicator to illustrate the financial stress is the spread between the             \n3-month London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) and the 3-month overnight index swap (OIS). \nWhile LIBOR measures the market's anticipation of monetary policy, plus a risk premium, the \nOIS measures what the markets expect the US Federal Reserve funds rate to be over the 3-\nmonth period comparable to the 3-month LIBOR. Thus, the spread between LIBOR and the OIS \ncaptures  risks  perceptions  in  the  credit  markets  and  closely  tracks  the  breakdown  in  key \nfinancial markets.3 As shown in Figure 2(a), the LIBOR\u2013OIS spread before July 2007 was stable \nat around 10 basis points. The start of the subprime mortgage elevated risk perceptions, and \nthe failure of important financial institutions in the US and uncertainty intensified the crisis in \nSeptember 2008, pushing the spread to over 350 basis points. While the LIBOR\u2013OIS spread \nhas declined significantly, the interbank market remains dysfunctional. Much of the liquidity \nsupplied by the central bank to commercial banks now ends up back in the central banks, \nreflecting  continuing  worries  about  counterparty  concerns  and  uncertainty  surrounding  the \namount needed to fund future assets.4  \n \nFigure 2: Financial Crisis in the United States \n  (a)The LIBOR-OIS Spread 2006\u20132009 (bps)             (b) Emerging Market Bond Financing ($ billion)  \n \n400 80\n \n350 70\n  300 60\n  250 50\n200 40\n \n150 30\n  100 20\n  50 10\n0 0\n  Jan- May- Sep- Jan- May- Sep- Jan- May- Sep- Jan- Q106Q206Q306 Q406Q107Q207Q307Q407Q108 Q208Q308Q408\n  06 06 06 07 07 07 08 08 08 09 Public Corporate\nbps = basis points, LIBOR = London interbank offered rate, OIS = Overnight Index Swap. \nSources: Bloomberg, Dealogic, and International Monetary Fund.  \n \n14.  The drying up of liquidity, continued deleveraging, and heightened risk aversion have \ndeepened the withdrawal of capital from developing member countries and caused the cost of \ncapital to rise. As shown in Figure 2(b), lending to emerging markets has dropped sharply. \nEmerging bond markets were virtually shut down for a period in Q4 2008. Corporations are \nexpected to tap banks for shorter-term loans, raising rollover risks further. Capital markets \nremained reluctant to lend because of potentially large rollover risks and the challenges the \ncorporations face ahead resulting from the economic slowdown. The Institute of International \nFinance estimated that net private capital flow to emerging economies declined to $467 billion in \n2008\u2014about half of the 2007 level\u2014and forecasts a sharp decline to $165 billion for 2009.5 The \n                                                 \n3   The LIBOR-OIS measure is clearly tracked by the other measures of liquidity and credit risk, all of which indicate a \nsimilar pattern and timing in the resulting breakdown of financial markets.

Financial  Sector  Repercussions.  Large  and  negative  impacts  on  the  Indonesian \neconomy emerged in October 2008 resulting from Indonesia\u2019s relatively open capital account \nand significant foreign ownership of the country\u2019s bond and stock markets (Figure 3). These \nimpacts were manifested in a number of forms: (i) the stock market declined by 31% during \nOctober 2008, (ii) yields on medium-term domestic bonds increased by nearly 400 basis points, \n(iii) Indonesia\u2019s international bond spreads surged by about 650 basis points, and (iv) the rupiah \ndepreciated by 17% against the US dollar. In addition, the Government lost almost $7 billion of \nits international reserves during the same month\u2014falling to $50.6 billion at end of October. The \ndirect effect of the global crisis on Indonesia\u2019s banking system has been minor because of lack \nof direct investment in the troubled US assets. However, the indirect impacts on the Indonesian \nfinancial sector have been significant. Two major impacts are as follows: (i) liquidity in the \nbanking system has been very tight since September because of a rapid increase in domestic \nlending of about 30%, in part attributable to the squeeze on US dollar lines, and capital outflow; \nand (ii) elevated risk perceptions about the Indonesian financial sector and economy have \nlimited Indonesia\u2019s access to international credit markets and raised the cost of borrowing. \nIndonesia  has  experienced  portfolio  outflows,  reflecting  the  deteriorating  financial  positions \nabroad. By the end of December 2008, the Indonesian stock exchange had fallen by over 50% \nsince the start of the year, typical of other markets in the region. Government debt markets have \nbeen hit especially hard by the widening global crisis, with yields on both rupiah and US dollar \nbonds rising sharply (Figure 3). The yields on Indonesian domestic bonds remained elevated \nand rose more sharply than elsewhere in the region in September and October 2008. The yields \nrecovered somewhat in November as sales by foreign bondholders slowed, but the market \nremains fragile and bond yields remain more than one-third above their levels in July 2008. \n \n16.  Fiscal Impact. Government finances have been especially vulnerable to spikes in global \nrisk  aversion  and  contagion  from  external  markets  because  of  the  country\u2019s  large  gross \nfinancing needs and the need for a fiscal stimulus. The term structure of Indonesia\u2019s bonds led \nto sharply higher debt issuances in 2007 and 2008, and amortization is projected to remain at \nhigh levels through 2011. During normal market conditions, Indonesia was able to raise a \nsufficient amount of more than $12 billion from domestic and international markets in both 2007 \nand  2008  (Table  2-page  10).  However,  tighter  global  liquidity  and  higher  risk  premiums \ncombined  with  high  gross  financing  needs  has  raised  interest  rates  on  Indonesian  debt \ncompared with other economies in the region. With prohibitive yields on domestic and US dollar \nbonds, the Government could not access funds from the credit markets in Q4 2008, raising \nconcerns about possible budget financing constraints in 2009 (Figure 3 [e]). \n \n17.  Government\u2019s Policy Response. The Government has taken a number of proactive \nmeasures aimed at reducing the likelihood of further disruption, and maintaining the confidence \nand stability of the financial system. Key measures include the following: (i) establishment of a \nfinancial safety net regulation that clearly establishes the roles, responsibilities, and procedures \nthat govern the actions and responses of Bank Indonesia, the minister of finance, and the \nDeposit Insurance Corporation in the event of the failure of a financial institution; (ii) the central \nbank  strengthened  its  lender  of  last  resort  facility;  (iii)  increased  coverage  of  the  deposit \ninsurance scheme; and (iv) the central bank eased liquidity in the banking sector through \nmonetary  expansion  (paras.  37\u201338).  With  these  measures  in  place,  some  indicators  have \nshown signs of improvement, although it is still too early to be certain that this will be sustained. \nThe stock market and the rupiah have stabilized since November 2008 and the international \n ", "  9\nreserves position has remained sufficient at around $55 billion at the end of March 2009. \nInflation declined to 7.9% in March 2009 and is expected to decline further in the first half of \n2009. While significant amounts of external capital have already been withdrawn from the \ncountry\u2019s financial markets, Indonesia remains vulnerable to further foreign capital outflows and \ndomestic capital flight. \n \n \nFigure 3:  Impacts of Global Financial Crisis in Indonesia \n \n \n \n         (a) Indonesia's Stock Market Index  (b) Rupiah Exchange Rate \n   \n    3000  13000\n \n   \n  2500 12000\n   \n2000 11000\n   \n    1500 10000\n \n    1000 9000\n    8000\n500\n  Jan-08 Apr-08 Jul-08 Oct-08 Jan-09\n  Jan-08 Apr-08 Jul-08 Oct-08 Jan-09\n \n   \n    (c) Domestic Currencies Bond Yields  (d) Spreads on US Dollar Sovereign Bonds \n \n    25 1200\n   \n1000\n    20\n    Indonesia 800 Indonesia USD Bond \n  15 Stripped Spreads\n    600\n    10 Philippines\n    400\n  5\n  Thailand 200 Indonesia's difference with \n  SE Asia Average\n    0\nJan-08 Mar-08 May-08 Jul-08 Sep-08 Nov-08 Jan-09 Mar-09 0\n    Jan-08 Mar-08 May-08 Jul-08 Sep-08 Nov-08 Jan-09 Mar-09\n \n \n   \n      (e) Rupiah Bond Issuance 2007\u20132009 (Rp trillion)  (f) Foreign Owned Rupiah Bond (Rp trillion) \n    25 120\n \n \n  100\n20\n \n  80\n    15\n60\n   \n10\n    40\n \n  5 20\n \n \n  0 0\nJan-07 Apr-07 Jul-07 Oct-07 Jan-08 Apr-08 Jul-08 Oct-08 Jan-09 Jan-07 May-07 Sep-07 Jan-08 May-08 Sep-08 Jan-09\n   \n   \nSources: Ministry of Finance, World Bank, JP.

Liquidity. Domestic market liquidity has started to ease since January 2009. After a lull \nof 3 months, the Government reentered the domestic market for selling government bonds. It \nsuccessfully raised about Rp9.2 trillion in bonds in January and again Rp4.8 trillion in February. \nIt  also  reentered  international  credit  markets  and  raised  $2  billion  in  10-year  bonds  and \n$1 billion in 5-year bonds in February 2009. While recent developments are encouraging, the \nGovernment projects that market conditions will be more difficult for the rest of the year. In \naddition, the maturities structure of the recent domestic issuance was skewed toward 1-year \nbonds, indicating that elevated risk and tight liquidity in the domestic financial sector remains. \nAs Figure 4 shows, prior to the global crisis bonds with maturity above 3 years accounted for \n80% of the total volume of bond issuances. In January 2009, the structure was reversed with 1-\nyear  bonds  accounting  for  60%  and  maturity  above  3  years  accounting  for  20%  of  total \nissuances. This will elevate rollover risk and budget financing pressures over the next 2 years. \nThe issuance of international bonds was also at relatively high cost, with yields more than 800 \nbasis points above comparable US treasury bills.  \n \n ", "  11\nFigure 4: Government Bond Issuance by Tenor \n \n   (a) Pre-Global Crisis            (b) Global Crisis \n        (issuances during January 2007\u2013August 2008)         (issuances in January 2009) \n         \n  1 year Above 5 to 0 year\n  20% 1%\n \n  Above 3 to 5 year\n  Above10 year 36%\n  43% 3 year\n  12%\n \n1 year\n  60%\n \n3 year\n  Above 3 to 5 year\nAbove 5 to 0 year 3%\n  11%\n14%\n \n \nNote: The Government issues rupiah-denominated bonds with the following maturities: 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 5 \nyears, 7 years, 10 years, 15 years, and 30 years. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n19.  The Second Round Effects of the Global Crisis. The condition of the global economy \ndeteriorated markedly in Q4 2008, with economic indicators in all major developed economies \npointing toward a severe downward and broad-based real-economy adjustment. New economic \ndata on the global economy released in March 2009 point to a much deeper and most likely \nprotracted recession in several of Indonesia\u2019s major trading partners not seen since after World \nWar II. The economies of the US, United Kingdom (UK), and Japan contracted in Q3 and Q4 \n2008 (Figure 5), with the US economy contracting by 6.3% in Q4 2008 on a year-on-year basis. \nThe Republic of Korea\u2019s economy contracted by 3.6% in Q4 2008. Singapore\u2019s economy, a bell-\nweather for the Southeast Asia exports industry, contracted by 4.2% in Q4 2008 on a year-on-\nyear basis; and its government projects that GDP will contract 6%\u20139% in 2009.6 Global trade is \nprojected to contract in 2009 for the first time in 27 years. The International Monetary Fund \n(IMF)7 again revised its forecasts in January 2009 and suggested that global growth would fall to \n0.5% in 2009 from 3.8% in 2008. Against uncertainties in the financial markets, activities in the \nadvanced  economies  are  expected  to  contract  by  2%.  Economic  growth  in  emerging  and \ndeveloping economies is also expected to slow sharply to 3.2% from 6.2% in 2008 because of \nfalling export demand, lower commodity prices, and much tighter external financing constraints. \nThe lingering after-effects on the global economy of the financial crash of 2007\u20132008 and the \ndemand destruction of 2008\u20132009 suggest that the pace of recovery will be slow and the \nsubsequent expansion may not return to the pace that prevailed in 2004\u20132007 for some years \nto come. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n6  Ministry of Trade and Industry. 2009.

International  action  to  prevent  the  crisis  from  worsening  further  has  been \nunprecedentedly aggressive. Early October 2008 saw a coordinated interest rate cut by major \ncentral banks in advanced economies (with the notable exception of Japan, where rates were \nalready extremely low). Policy rates have continued to fall since then and further reductions are \nlikely  in  early  2009.  Unorthodox  measures\u2014such  as  substantial  expansion  in  the  balance \nsheets  of  the  central  banks  (quantitative  easing),  and  central  bank  easing  of  the  criteria \ngoverning the quality of securities acceptable as collateral\u2014were undertaken by the US Federal \nReserve and other central banks, and these measures are likely to be further expanded in \n2009.8 On  the  fiscal  side,  the  US,  European  Union,  Japan,  and  UK  have  all  announced \nsignificant  fiscal  stimulus  packages.  Despite  these  and  other  massive  rescue  packages, \nfinancial markets remain highly stressed because of elevated risks, linked to lacking confidence \nin counterparties and their balance sheets. \n \n21.  Against this backdrop, economic growth in Indonesia is expected to decelerate in 2009 \nbecause of the projected sharp reduction in external demand for exports. Indeed, export value \ncontracted by 33% year-on-year in February 2009. The recent decline in commodity prices will \nalso have a negative impact on Indonesia. Projected decline in capital inflows, particularly \nforeign  direct  investment,  will  constrain  investment.  The  Government  has  revised  its \nmacroeconomic  framework  and  projects  growth  to  decline  to  4.5%  for  2009,  with  higher \nunemployment and increase poverty rate. The Economist Intelligence Unit projects a lower \ngrowth rate of about 2% resulting from faltering exports and stalling foreign investments.9 \n \n22.  Poverty Alleviation and Employment. Indonesia has made solid progress in poverty \nreduction since the Asian financial crisis. High and inclusive economic growth over the past 6 \nyears has benefited the poor. The poverty rate has fallen by about one percentage point per \nyear since 2003, reaching 17.8% in 2006, and falling further to 15.4% in 2008. However, poverty \nremains a serious problem in Indonesia with over 35 million persons below the national poverty \n                                                 \n8  For example, the US Federal Reserve's balance sheet was expanded from $800 billion in 2008 to $2.1 trillion by \nOctober 2008. \n9  Economist Intelligence Unit. 2009. Indonesia, Country Report. London (February)  \n ", "  13\nline  and  another  42%  vulnerable  to  falling  into  poverty  if  their  circumstances  suddenly \ndeteriorate (Appendix 5). Public services remain inadequate for a middle-income country, and \nnon-income poverty is also a major problem in terms of high malnutrition and maternal mortality \nrates, inadequate access to safe water and sanitation, and education outcomes. Furthermore, \ninequality is increasing and disparities between regions remain high. On the employment front, \nthe results have been mixed. Open unemployment has declined from its peak of 11.2% in 2005 \nto 8.0% in 2008 because of solid economic growth. However, shares of formal employment in \ntotal employment remain relatively stagnant at around 32% of the work force. The Government \nis concerned that the current global financial crisis will have adverse effects on its efforts to \nreduce  poverty  if  there  is  a  significant  reduction  in  economic  growth,  retrenchments,  and \nshrinking  employment  opportunities.  Recent  retrenchment  data  from  the  Department  of \nManpower and Transmigration point to increased layoffs, particularly in the export sector. Based \non the current low case growth scenario of 4.5% economic growth for 2009, the National \nDevelopment Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) projects that unemployment could increase by up \nto 1 million persons or 0.8 percentage points, and poverty could increase by about 3 million\u2013\n4 million persons or about 1\u20132 percentage points of the population\u2014reversing recent gains in \npoverty reduction. In this context of second round effects in a global environment of tight \nliquidity and elevated banking sector risk, key issues for Indonesia mitigating the global impact \nof the crisis on its economy include (i) reassuring financial markets and maintaining financial \nsystem stability, (ii) sustaining critical public expenditures and the need for a fiscal stimulus, and \n(iii) sustaining exports and private sector investment. The challenges facing Indonesia as a \nresult of the global financial crisis are summarized in a problem tree presented in Appendix 9. \n \n1.  Reassuring Financial Markets and Maintaining Financial System Stability \n \n23.  After  the  1997\u20131998  Asian  financial  crisis,  the  Government  introduced  a  series  of \nregulatory reforms to its financial sector. The main change has been a focus on risk-based \nsupervision  and  consolidated  supervision  of  groups  rather  than  traditional  monitoring  of \ncompliance with regulations by individual banks. This has involved better understanding of \nbanks\u2019 risk management and internal control systems, focus on corporate governance and \nresponsibilities of board of directors and management, stress testing of capital adequacy, and \nimproved  off-site  monitoring  systems.  Indonesia  has  made  progress  in  strengthening \nsupervision capacity, off-site monitoring, early warning systems, corporate governance, and \nresponsibilities of board of directors and management.10 Regulatory reforms and reforms to \nsupervision  practices  have  greatly  strengthened  the  soundness  of  the  Indonesian  banking \nsector to withstand the indirect effects of the global financial crisis. These measures were \nrecently tested in the recent case of a bank failure at the end of 2008, where empowered \nregulatory authorities were able to take control of the situation quickly with minimum impact on \nconfidence in the banking sector. Bank Indonesia dismissed the bank's management and the \nDeposit Insurance Agency (LPS) swiftly took over and recapitalized the bank. With limited \nexposure to troubled US assets, banks\u2019 capital adequacy ratios remain sound and NPLs were \nrelatively low in February 2009 (Figure 6). The loan\u2013deposit ratio has dropped gradually to \n75.5% after peaking at 81.6% in August 2008. Banking sector liquidity (liquid assets to total \nassets) also started ease in December 2008 but remained relatively tight in Q1 2009.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n10 Lindgren, Carl-Johan 2006.

Vulnerabilities to Financial Sector. As the second round effects of the global crisis \nspillover to the real sector, demand for credit is expected to fall, and NPLs are expected to rise \nin 2009\u2014placing some stress on the domestic banking sector. Moreover, financial sector risks \nremain elevated because of continued uncertainty about the extent of damage to the global \nfinancial  system,  so  Indonesia  remains  vulnerable  to  any  additional  shocks  to  the  global \nfinancial sector. Lessons from the 1997\u20131998 financial crisis demonstrate the importance for the \nGovernment to reassure financial markets quickly about the soundness of its banking system \nand ensure that measures are in place to address increased risks. These include enhanced \ncoordination and clarification of responsibilities between the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the \ncentral bank in the case of both nonsystemic and systemic banking crises, and a credible \ndeposit insurance scheme that retains confidence in the banking system while minimizing moral \nhazard. Another area for strengthening is the central bank\u2019s lender of last resort facility. Under \nthe current Bank Indonesia Law (Law No. 23/1999), Bank Indonesia is the lender of last resort \nfor the banking sector. This means that banks could borrow in the short term from Bank \nIndonesia, backed up by high quality assets (government bonds and Bank Indonesia Certificate \n[SBI]). The recent tight liquidity pressure in the interbank market meant that Bank Indonesia \nwould be unable to take prompt action to ease such pressures and prevent liquidity problems \nfrom becoming more systemic.  \n \n2.  Sustaining  Critical  Public  Expenditures  While  Maintaining  Budget \nDiscipline \n \n25.  Need for Fiscal Stimulus. With the unfolding impacts on growth in regional economies, \nthe Government\u2019s economic priorities focused on protecting the real sector and mitigating the \neffects on poverty, in addition to maintaining confidence and stability in the financial sector. In \nJanuary 2009, the Government revised its 2009 budget, which was passed by parliament in \nNovember 2008. It now assumes a lower economic growth rate of 4.5%, down from 6%, with \nfurther downward revisions expected in the coming months, an exchange rate of Rp11,000 (up \nfrom Rp9,400), and oil prices around $45 per barrel (down from $80 per barrel). These budget \nrevisions lower tax revenue collections by Rp64.1 trillion and nontax revenue collections by \nRp73.1 trillion. Savings from fuel and other subsidies from the fall in oil prices add Rp34 trillion. \n ", "  15\nWhile spending in some non-priority sectors will be revised down, the revised budget protects \nspending on public infrastructure, education, and poverty alleviation programs. The budget also \nprovides additional fiscal stimulus measures on the expenditure side (Rp16.9 trillion) and tax \nrelief to stressed sectors on the revenue side (Rp56.3 trillion). The Government has budgeted \nRp3.8 trillion (or $345 million) for its unconditional cash transfer (UCT) program for January and \nFebruary 2009 to mitigate the poverty impact of the global crisis. As a result, the Government \nnow projects an increase in the budget deficit from 1.0% of GDP to 2.5% of GDP, and increased \ngross financing needs from $18.2 billion to $24.6 billion for 2009 (Table 2). MOF estimates that \nthe fiscal stimulus is equivalent to 1.3% of GDP.  \n \n26.  Public Expenditure. The effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus will depend on the budget \nallocation to priority sectors and the speed of disbursements. Under the World Bank\u2019s DPL and \nADB\u2019s  DPSP,  the  Government  has  made  much  progress  in  improving  budget  credibility, \nexecution, and reporting. However, weaknesses remain in budget execution, especially delays \nin disbursements and procurement caused by administration weakness. In the current adverse \nconditions, it will be important for the Government to advance its procurement processing \ntimetable for 2009, shift discretionary spending to priority areas in a timely manner, and roll over \nunspent 2008 budget for public infrastructure.  \n \n27.  Poverty Impacts. A core purpose of the fiscal stimulus is to protect jobs and recent \ngains in poverty reduction. The Government has several poverty alleviation programs that can \neasily be scaled up. In 2008, the Government reactivated the UCT program to compensate poor \nfamilies  for  the  fuel  and  commodity  rice  increases.  The  UCT  program  covered  19  million \nhouseholds  based  on  the  database  used  in  the  previous  UCT  in  2005  and  2006.  Each \nhousehold  received  Rp100,000  per  month  on  a  quarterly  basis.  Available  data  about  the \nantipoverty effectiveness of the UCT is encouraging. According to data from the 2008 National \nSocioeconomic Survey (Susenas), the UCT maintained the welfare levels of 60% of recipient \nhouseholds and assisted 30% of recipient households to escape from poverty, while about 10% \nof households under the scheme fell into poverty because of food price inflation in 2008. The \nGovernment has extended the UCT to the first 2 months of 2009 and this could be prolonged if \nnecessary. The Government has allocated Rp7 trillion for the National Empowerment Program \n(PNPM) for 2009. Under lower growth scenarios for 2009, BAPPENAS projects that poverty-\nrelated  spending  will  increase  by  about  Rp9.9  trillion  (Rp4.9  trillion  for  the  existing  social \nprotection programs (Figure 7[b]) and Rp5 trillion for PNPM).   The conditional cash transfer \nprogram is still in a pilot stage, covering 1 million households, and is unlikely to be scaled up to \nmitigate the poverty effects of the economic slowdown. The Government has several other \nprograms related to the social sector, including education and health. Through the national and \nregional  budgets,  social  expenditure  has  increased  substantially  in  real  terms  since  2001 \n(Figure 7). Government spending on education and health in real terms increased by over 100% \nfrom 2001 to 2007. The share of education spending in the Government\u2019s 2007 budget was \n17% and health spending accounted for 4.5%.  It will be important to protect the gains in social \nspending during the current adverse situation. However, the effectiveness of the fiscal stimulus \nin mitigating the poverty effects will also depend on how the Government is able to quickly \nidentify families at risk of falling into poverty or more severe poverty, and deterioration in \nregional incomes from the slowdown in exports. Currently, the Government does not have a \npoverty  monitoring  and  response  mechanism  that  could  provide  information  about \ndevelopments in household poverty on a timely basis that would allow the Government to \nrespond promptly with targeted poverty alleviation programs. Thus, to mitigate the effects of the \neconomic slowdown, it will be important for the Government to establish a poverty monitoring \nunit coordinated across relevant ministries.  \n \n ", "16    \n \n       Figure 7: Indonesia's Social Spendinga \n \n   (a) Education and Health        (b) Projected Increase in Social Protection Spending \n     \n80 6\n \n70 5\n \n60\n4\n \n50\n  3\n40\n  30 2\n  20 1\n  10\n0\n  0 10-15 16-20 21-30\n2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007\n \nAffected Household (million) Projected Costs (Rp. trillion)\n  Education Health\n \n    a Education and Health spending are in 2000 constant price. \n  Sources: World Bank, Ministry of Finance, and BAPPENAS. \n \n3.  Crowding in Private Investment and Supporting Exports \n \n28.  Trade finance to developing countries is highly vulnerable in times of crisis. It collapsed \nduring the 1997\u20131998 Asian financial crisis, when bank lending declined by 80%. Up until \nSeptember 2008, Indonesia\u2019s exports were reaching record levels, primarily driven by high \ncommodity prices, with manufacturing exports also performing well. Investment, which slumped \nduring the 1998 crisis and took 5 years before it turned around, was growing in 2006 and 2007 \n(Figure 8). Foreign direct investment approvals were also robust in 2007. The global financial \ncrisis and recessionary conditions began to affect Indonesia\u2019s exports and investment in several \nways:  (i)  the  commodity  price  bust  resulted  in  contraction  in  commodity  export  values  by \nNovember 2008; (ii) the slowdown in global demand for exports began to hurt manufacturing \nexports, particularly garments and machinery; and (iii) the global credit crunch increased the \ncost of trade financing and sharply reduced trade finance as counterpart banks were reluctant to \naccept letters of credit. While no comprehensive data on the supply of trade finance is readily \navailable, there is anecdotal evidence that trade finance has become tight. Bank customers are \nnow required to put an 80%\u2013100% cash margin to have a letter of credit opened by banks, \ncompared with 20%\u201330% before the crisis. The global credit crunch and uncertainty about \neconomic growth have caused several foreign and domestic investments to be put on hold. The \nIndonesian central bank projects private sector lending to decline from 35% in 2008 to about \n15%\u201318% in 2009, although this is seen as optimistic by market commentators. \n \n29.  In this context of slowing exports and waning market confidence, it will be important to \nintroduce measures that boost confidence and improve access to trade finance. In particular, \nthe banking sector provides limited trade finance products; about 85% of exports are financed \non a cash basis, with the other 15% financed through letters of credit. Indonesia has a specialist \nexport bank (Bank Ekspor) although assessments of its performance indicate mixed results. The \nGovernment has drafted a new law converting Bank Ekspor into an export\u2013import agency that \nwould provide different trade finance products, including export credit guarantees, as well as a \nmandate to support diversification of export markets and small and medium-sized enterprises\u2019 \naccess to trade finance. The global financial crisis and the resulting credit crunch was a catalyst \nfor quick passage of the law in January 2009. It will be important to complete the new regulatory \nframework for the agency and operationalize it over the next 12 months.  \n \n \n ", "  17\n \nFigure 8: Indonesia's Export and Import Performance \n \n(% change year-on-year) \n \n \n  120\n \n \n  100\n \n  80\n \n    60\n \n  40\n \n  20\n \n \n  0\n \nJan- Jul- Jan- Jul- Jan- Jul- Jan- Jul- Jan-\n  -20\n  05 05 06 06 07 07 08 08 09\n  -40\n \n \n  -60\n  Exports Imports\n \n \n \nSource: Central Bureau of Statistics, Government of Indonesia, Jakarta. \n \n \n \nC.  Lessons \n30.  While  the  sources  of  the  current  global  financial  crisis  and  associated  risks  to  the \nIndonesian economy are different from the 1997\u20131998 Asian economic crisis, and subsequent \nreforms have made the Indonesian economy much more resilient to external shocks, lessons \nlearned from the 1998 economic crisis are embedded in the PESF Program. Key lessons \nrelevant to the current situation include the following:  \n \n(i)  The  Government  must  introduce  measures  that  maintain  confidence  in  the \nbanking sector. The absence of deposit insurance in 1997 exacerbated the fall in \nconfidence  in  the  domestic  banking  sector  after  16  banks  were  closed  in \nNovember  1997.  The  Government  introduced  a  blanket  guarantee  in \nJanuary 1998. Later in 2004, the Government introduced legislation to phase out \nthe blanket guarantee with a deposit insurance scheme.  \n(ii)  A special resolution regime for prompt corrective action to address failing banks \nis needed to prevent systemic collapse, rapidly restructure failing banks, and \nensure that fiscal authorities are ready to support bank resolution through capital \ninjections as necessary. The absence of such frameworks in 1997\u20131998 Asian \ncrisis required the establishment of a special and temporary resolution agency at \ngreat cost and involving mishandling. \n(iii)  The central bank should ensure liquidity in domestic credit markets to avoid a \ncredit crunch and ensure that banks maintain adequate capital. \n(iv)  The Government should ensure that access to trade finance remains open to \nexporters and importers.  \n(v)  The Government should provide an appropriate fiscal stimulus while maintaining \nfiscal discipline. During 1998, the Government operated budget surpluses as the \ngovernment administration was unable to disburse because of political crisis. \nThis exacerbated the deep recession and its duration. Thus, it is important to \nprovide  for  timely  spending  disbursements  to  ensure  the  fiscal  stimulus  is \neffective.  \n ", "18    \n \n(vi)  Effective social assistance programs are necessary to mitigate the worse effects \nof the economic slowdown on vulnerable families. In this regard, it is important to \nestablish  effective  poverty  monitoring  systems  to  quickly  identify  and  target \nvulnerable  groups  and  regions  for  assistance.  It  is  critical  to  have  social \nassistance programs and mechanisms to ensure timely assistance and minimize \nleakages to non-target groups. The lack of effective programs in 1998 meant that \nvulnerable  groups  quickly  fell  into  poverty,  with  little  assistance  from  the \nGovernment, resulting in increased rates and severity of poverty.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n31.  The  impact  of  the  PESF  will  be  to  mitigate  the  adverse  economic  and  social \nconsequences of the global financial crisis on Indonesia. The outcome of the PESF will be to \nsecure adequate access to budget financing for critical expenditures and the required counter-\ncyclical policy.  \n \n32.  The  PESF  includes  a  series  of  policy  measures  that  address  the  increased \nvulnerabilities and risks to the Indonesian economy from the global financial crisis and sharp \nslowdown in the global economy, and underpin the key priorities of the Government\u2019s reform \nagenda. These reforms are designed to accomplish the following:  \n \n(i)  Financial system stability. Reassure financial markets and maintain financial \nsystem stability by enhancing the financial safety net, maintaining the stability of \nthe banking system, and ensuring predictability in the Government\u2019s financing \nrequirements for 2009 and 2010.  \n(ii)  Critical  public  expenditure.  Sustain  critical  public  expenditures  while \nmaintaining  budget  discipline  to  mitigate  the  poverty  impacts  of  the  growth \nslowdown through strengthened coordination of national poverty reduction efforts; \nestablishing a national poverty monitoring and response system; and increasing \ncritical public expenditures in the areas of poverty alleviation, social protection, \nand  infrastructure  maintenance  and  development.  This  will  be  done  by \nundertaking  actions  to  speed  up  budget  disbursement  through  improving \nefficiency  in  budget  disbursements,  promoting  advance  procurement,  and \ncarrying over unspent cash from the 2008 budget.  \n(iii)  Private investment and exports. Crowd in private investment and exports by \nrevising  the  implementing  decree  for  the  Investment  Law,  improving \ntransparency in revenues from extractive industries, and enhancing access to \ntrade finance.  \n \n33.  The  PESF  is  designed  to  be  a  single-tranche  loan  with  scheduled  and  multiple \nwithdrawals to be made over the program period on the condition that, prior to each withdrawal, \n(i) the  Government  has  met  the  drawdown  triggers  set  out  in  the  financing  plan,  (ii)  the \nGovernment  has  maintained  an  appropriate  macroeconomic  framework,  and  (iii)  the \nGovernment has not reversed any policy actions under the policy matrix. The design and \nmonitoring framework for the PESF is in Appendix 1, the PESF policy matrix is in Appendix 2, \nand Appendix 3 contains the donor coordination matrix.  \n \n \n ", "  19\nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n \n34.  All 12 policy measures required for the PESF were carried out between September 2008 \nand March 2009.   \n \n1.  Actions  to  Reassure  Financial  Markets  and  Maintain  Financial  System \nStability \n \n35.  The PESF supports the Government\u2019s efforts to implement several actions promptly to \nreassure  financial  markets  about  the  soundness  of  the  financial  sector  and  the  regulatory \nframework to respond to the global financial crisis. The following measures toward boosting \nconfidence in the financial system were completed before Board consideration of the PESF \nProgram.  \n \n36.  Financial Safety Net. In October 2008, the Government issued Government Regulation \nin Lieu of Law (Perpu No. 4/2008) on Financial Safety Net. The legislation establishes the roles, \nresponsibilities, and procedures that govern the actions and responses of Bank Indonesia, MOF, \nand Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corporation in the event of the failure of a financial institution. \nin December 2008 parliament requested a revised draft to be submitted. The Government has \nsubmitted  a  revised  draft  to  parliament  and  the  bill  is  being  deliberated  by  a  special \nparliamentary committee.  \n \n37.  Deposit  Insurance  Scheme.  One lesson from the 1998 financial crisis is that the \nabsence of a credible deposit insurance scheme can exacerbate confidence in the banking \nsector and lead to systemic runs on banks. To arrest the run on banks in January 1998, the \nGovernment  provided  a  blanket  guarantee  on  deposits.  This  was  intended  as  an  interim \nmeasure  until  it  established  a  deposit  insurance  system.  In  September  2004,  the  Law  on \nDeposit Insurance Agency was passed; and in October 2005, the Indonesian Deposit Insurance \nAgency (LPS) was officially established. With the establishment of LPS, the coverage of the \ndeposit guarantee was gradually reduced from the full coverage instituted at the time of the \nAsian financial crisis to Rp100 million by March 2007. With the onset of the global credit crisis, \nthe  Government  increased  the  maximum  amount  of  insured  deposits  to  Rp2  billion  from \nRp100 million. The Government Regulation in Lieu of Law No. 3/2008 dated 13 October 2008 \nallows LPS to change the amount of insured deposits in the event that there is a risk that could \nreduce public confidence and endanger financial system stability. This legislation was followed \nup immediately with the issuance of Government Regulation No. 66/2008 on the same date, \nwhich increased the maximum amount of insured deposits to Rp2 billion from Rp100 million. \nThe regulation also allows the Government to provide a blanket guarantee of deposits, if it \ndeems it necessary. However, this authority does not cover interbank deposits. The regulation \nwas also introduced to align the regulatory framework with neighboring countries (including; \nHong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore) that had introduced a temporary unlimited guarantee on \nbank deposits in line with similar actions in several Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) countries including Australia, Ireland, and the UK. Perpu No. 3/2008 on \nthe amendment to the Deposit Insurance Corporation Law has been approved by the parliament \nand is now Law No. 7 Year 2009. \n \n38.  Lender of Last Resort Facility. Under the current Bank Indonesia Law, Bank Indonesia \nis the lender of last resort for the banking sector. This means that banks could borrow in the \nshort term from Bank Indonesia, backed up by high quality assets (government bonds and Bank \nIndonesia Certificate (SBIs). The recent tight liquidity pressure in the interbank market had \nprompted  Bank  Indonesia  to  take  action  to  ease  such  pressures  and  to  prevent  liquidity \n ", "20    \n \nproblems from becoming more systemic. It has done so by accepting an additional type of \nassets as collateral for short-term financing to banks. The Government issued a Government \nRegulation in Lieu of Law No. 2/2008 that amends the Bank Indonesia Law; and Bank Indonesia \nissued a circular letter (No. 10/29/DPM) which, under certain circumstances, broadens the types \nof assets that banks can use as collaterals when borrowing from Bank Indonesia. Perpu No. \n2/2008 on the amendment of the Bank Indonesia Law has been approved by parliament and is \nnow Law No. 6 Year 2009.  \n \n39.  Financial Sector Assessment Program. Following up from its commitment at the G-20 \nsummit in November 2008, the Government has formally requested the IMF and World Bank to \nconduct a financial sector assessment program (FSAP) for Indonesia. The FSAP, which will be \nthe first for Indonesia, seeks to identify the strengths and vulnerabilities of a country\u2019s financial \nsystem,  determine  how  key  sources  of  risk  are  being  managed,  ascertain  the  sector\u2019s \ndevelopmental and technical assistance needs, and help prioritize policy responses. The FSAP, \nled by the IMF and World Bank, will take about 1 year to complete. The implementation of FSAP \nrecommendations to strengthen the country\u2019s financial system will be used as input into the \nproposed ADB DPSP series and Capital Market Program.  \n \n40.  Budget Financing Requirements. With increased uncertainty about the functioning of \nglobal credit markets over the next 12\u201324 months, and in view of the need for a fiscal stimulus, \nthe Government has issued a contingent financing plan in case there are shortfalls in its budget \nfinancing in 2009. The Government has indicated that its first preference is to use its access to \ndomestic  and/or  international  markets  to  meet  its  financing  targets.  The  financing  plan \nincorporates quarterly targets for rupiah and US dollar bond issuances. Under the financing plan, \nthe  Government  has  projected  financing  requirements  from  the  market  of  $12.5  billion \nequivalent for 2009. However, in the event of tight market conditions, the Government and \ndevelopment  partners  have  established  broad  parameters  on  the  basis  of  which  the \nGovernment may withdraw the $5.5 billion funds available from the PESF to meet its quarterly \nfinancing shortfall during the program period. The Government and development partners will \nassess the Government\u2019s financing shortfall every quarter and determine if disbursement from \nthe PESF is required. The Government and development partners view the financing plan as an \nimportant fiscal risk management tool during the uncertain and difficult global environment, and \nwill review these parameters on an ongoing basis. If the contingent loan is not fully drawn in \n2009, the financing plan includes a mechanism for rolling over available funds to be potentially \nused within the context of the financing plan for 2010. \n \n41.  In  line  with  the  financing  plan,  the  Government  and  development  partners  have \ncommitted to the principles that the loan would be used only where the following circumstances \nexist: \n \n(i)  Sound  Macroeconomic  Framework.  The  overall  macroeconomic  situation \ncontinues to be sound and the policy program on track. However, given the \nglobal financing crisis and the importance of the Government\u2019s financing plan, \nthe development partners and the Government have decided that a review of the \nGovernment\u2019s macroeconomic policy framework and its progress in carrying out \nthe PESF (including its financing plan) will be undertaken on a quarterly basis in \naccordance with the jointly agreed governance arrangements. \n(ii)  Limited Market Access. Indonesia has limited market access because of global \nand/or domestic liquidity constraints, so it needs access to the facility to maintain \npublic spending and/or requires additional fiscal stimulus. The withdrawals will be \nlinked to Indonesia\u2019s access to market finance, where access will be assessed \n ", "  21\nfrom a set of objective criteria (such as yields on domestic and foreign debt) \nguided by best practices in debt management (such as allocation of short versus \nlong-term debt tenure considerations and currency composition of debt), required \nchanges in the fiscal policy stance (such as the need for further fiscal stimulus), \nand any potential crowding out effects on private sector credit.    \n(iii)  Phased Withdrawals. Withdrawals from the PESF are phased as needed. The \nfull  amount  of  the  loan  is  unlikely  to  be  required  at  once.  Therefore,  the \nGovernment has articulated a schedule of withdrawals in line with its financing \nplan. It is expected that the loan will be withdrawn each quarter after the joint \ngovernment  and  development  partner  review  meeting,  with  a  cap  on  the \nmaximum amount that can be drawn down each quarter. In the event that the \nGovernment does not utilize the full amount of the loan (either partially or fully) in \nany one quarter, such unutilized amounts will be rolled over to another quarter \nuntil the Program\u2019s completion date at the end of 2010. However, if market \nconditions continue to improve, the Government may not withdraw funds from the \nPESF. If there are unwithdrawn loan amounts at the end of the Program, the \nGovernment and/or ADB can cancel the unwithdrawn amounts.  \n(iv)  Proportionate disbursement from development partners. The financing plan \nindicates that if the withdrawal is warranted, the Government will draw down \nsupport from development partners proportional to their commitment. This way, \nthe support and risk would be spread across all the partners participating in the \nPESF.  \n \n42.  The financing plan includes a governance arrangement that allows the Government and \nits development partners, including ADB, to meet in the quarterly meetings or extraordinary \nmeetings  to  (i)  assess  the  Government\u2019s  macroeconomic  policy  framework,  (ii)  evaluate \nprogress  in  implementation  of  the  financing  plan,  and  (iii)  determine  the  amount  that  the \nGovernment will draw on support provided by the ADB and other development partners. The \nGovernment and any development partner could also request additional meetings to respond to \nevolving economic conditions. In the event that the Government proposes changes to the \nfinancing plan, but the changes do not involve a change to the objective of the financing plan \n(such as changes in the Government\u2019s financing targets or its market access parameters), these \nwill be done on a consensus basis with the Government and other development partners. The \nrevisions to the parameters will be guided by, but not limited to, the following considerations: \n(i) inflation rate, (ii) increased cost of bonds with longer maturities, (iii) bond maturities structure \nand volume consistent with past practice and prudent debt management, and (iv) possible \ncrowding effects on the private sector. \n \n2.  Actions to Sustain Critical Public Expenditures While Maintaining Budget \nDiscipline \n \n43.  The PESF supports the Government\u2019s strategy to mitigate the adverse poverty impact \nfrom the global financial crisis and destruction in external demand. The following measures \ntoward protecting the poor were completed before Board consideration of the PESF Program.  \n \n44.  Poverty Monitoring System. While the financial crisis will affect many sectors, the \nfocus  of  this  initiative\u2014to  measure  poverty  impacts\u2014will  be  collecting  real-time  data  on \nemployment and dismissals, wage data, farmers\u2019 incomes, prices of basic commodities, health, \neducation,  and  social  welfare.  Preliminary  data  and  information  about  the  socioeconomic \nimpacts will be obtained through media tracking, followed by data collection via national and \nlocal  government  apparatus,  networks/partners,  local  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs) \n ", "22    \n \nand  associations,  local  universities,  and  poverty  program  field  facilitators.  Secondary  data \nanalysis will be available from related government agencies such as the Central Bureau of \nStatistics (BPS), Department of Manpower and Transmigration, and other ministries/government \ninstitutions  concerned.  The  emphasis  will  be  on  providing  an  accurate  account  of  the \nsocioeconomic impact of the crisis, especially its implications on the level and extent of poverty. \nWith this information, the poverty monitoring system would be able to (i) provide a timely \nassessment  of  the  poverty  impact  of  the  current  global  financial  crisis  to  stakeholders \nconcerned, i.e., the Government, international agencies, development partners, NGOs, and civil \nsociety; (ii) provide the Government with policy-relevant recommendations; (iii) assist in the \nformulation of effective policies and programs; and (iv) provide feedback on the effectiveness of \nthe Government\u2019s policies and programs put in place to respond to the negative impacts of the \nfinancial crisis. \n45.  Overall responsibility for the poverty monitoring system will rest with the deputy for \ndevelopment performance evaluation in BAPPENAS (Figure 9). At district and provincial levels, \nthe Subnational Development Agencies (BAPPEDAs) will be the contact points for data and \ninformation gathering on the impact of the global crisis. Such data may originate from the \nvarious sectoral departments, other local government agencies, or BPS. In addition, nonstate \nactors  (such  as  regional  offices  of  professional  organizations  and  associations,  research \ninstitutes, and NGOs) may be sources of data on the regional impact of the crisis. Facilitators of \nthe different poverty alleviation programs (such as PNPM, Operational Aid to Schools Prorgram \n(BOS), Unconditional Cash Transfer (UCT) will also be able to provide reliable data on the \nimpact of the crisis.  \n46.  National Poverty Reduction Efforts. After extensive consultations within government, \nand with development agencies and civil society for the past 6 months, the Government issued \na presidential regulation on coordination of national poverty reduction efforts in March 2009. The \nproposed decree is important at this stage because it will help coordinate and streamline the \nimplementation of poverty reduction efforts at both national and local levels. The decree outlines \nthe  functions,  responsibilities,  and  organization  of  the  coordination  committees  for  poverty \nreduction  at  national,  provincial,  and  district  levels.  At  the  national  level,  the  coordination \ncommittee is led by the coordinating minister for social welfare, with membership from all major \nministries. At provincial level, the committee is chaired by the provincial governor and at district \nlevel by the district governor. The committees will have three working groups focusing on social \nsafety net programs, community empowerment programs, and microcredit and small business \ndevelopment. With the decree, the Government will harmonize and streamline interventions \nfrom some 60 community-based projects executed by 22 sectoral ministries as well as activities \nfrom NGOs. This will enable the Government to respond more efficiently to poverty impacts \nfrom the financial crisis.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  23\nFigure 9: Poverty Monitoring System \nNational \n \nCMSW (Poverty Alleviation  Multilateral crisis and poverty \n  BAPPENAS \nCoordination Team)  monitoring initiatives  \n  Deputy  \n(e.g., from UN agencies) \n  DPE \n \n \nNational level state actors:  National level non-state actors: \n  Poverty \n\u2022  Central offices of government  \u2022  Professional organizations \n  Monitoring \nministries  \u2022  Private universities \n  \u2022  BPS  Initiative \u2022  Research institutes \n  \u2022  State universities  \u2022  NGOs \n \n \nProvince \n \n \nProvincial \n  Provincial level state actors:  Provincial level non-state actors: \nBAPPEDA \n  \u2022  Dinas from the different  \u2022  Professional organizations \n  sectors  \u2022  Private universities \n  \u2022  Other LG agencies  \u2022  Research institutes \n  \u2022  BPS  \u2022  NGOs \n  \u2022  State universities \n \n  District \n \nDistrict \n  District level state actors:  BAPPEDA  District level non-state actors: \n  \u2022  Dinas from the different  \u2022  Professional organizations \n  sectors  \u2022  Research institutes \n  \u2022  Other LG agencies  \u2022  NGOs \n  \u2022  BPS \n  Poverty alleviation \n  programs  \n(PNPM, BOS, etc.) \n \n \n \n \nFacilitators \n \n \n \nBAPPEDA = Subnational Development and Planning Agency, BAPPENAS = National Development and Planning \nAgency, BPS = Central Bureau of Statistics, BOS = Operational Aid to Schools Program, CMSW = Coordinating \nMinistry for Social Welfare, DPE = Deputy Performance and Evaluation, LG = Local Government, PNPM = National \nCommunity Empowerment Program, NGO = Nongovernment Organitation, UN = United Nations. \nSource: BAPPENAS. \n \n47.  Poverty Alleviation Efforts. To protect critical public expenditures, the Government \nundertook the following measures to expedite disbursement in 2009: \n \n(i)  Implemented  a  socialization  campaign  to  promote  advance  procurement \nprocessing,  appoint  multiyear  treasury  officers,  and  speed  up  disbursements \nthrough Director General (DG) Treasury. \n(ii)  Established a monitoring committee for the budget activity list (DIPA) 2009 to \nimprove budget disbursements. The committee is established under a Ministry of \nFinance decree and comprises the DG Treasury (chair), DG Budget, head of \n ", "24    \n \nFiscal Policy Office, and BAPPENAS. It meets monthly to review the progress of \nfunds  disbursement  and  readiness  of  DIPA  releases  to  ensure  that  all \nbottlenecks in the disbursement of budget funds are removed in real time in close \nconsultation with the ministries concerned.  \n(iii)  Improved the recording and reporting system in the satkers (budget spending \nunits). DG Treasury has provided satkers with a software application called SAI \nthat is being used to register expenditure transactions and compile financial \naccounts.  An  updated  version  of  this  software,  scheduled  for  rollout  in \nJanuary 2009, will include recording and reporting features. \n(iv)  Issued an MOF regulation with a simplified mechanism and process for carryover \nof unspent 2008 budget for the PNPM  to April 2009, as provided for under \nArticle 7A of Law No. 16/2008 on the revision of FY2008 budget. \n(v)  Issued an MOF regulation outlining procedures for simplified amending of 2009 \nDIPA documents and carryover of unspent 2008 budget for infrastructure. MOF \nregulation  No.  46/2008  on  the  procedure  for  amending  the  2008  DIPA \ndocuments  permits  line  ministries  to  reallocate  across  sub-activities  under  a \nsimpler  budget  (DIPA)  revision  mechanism  without  prior  amendment  of  the \nbudget allotment. This will allow for carryover of last year\u2019s infrastructure projects \nas provided for under Article 12 of the 2009 budget (Law No. 41/2008). \n \n3.  Actions to Crowd in Private Investment and Support Exports \n48.  The PESF supports the Government\u2019s efforts to improve access to trade finance and \ncrowd in investment. To mitigate the impact of global turmoil in investment and trade, the \nGovernment has developed a set of policy measures, including to (i) boost investor sentiment \nthrough  revising  investment  regulations,  (ii)  improving  transparency  in  extractive  industries \nrevenues, and (iii) easing access to trade finance for exporters. The Government undertook the \nfollowing measures before Board consideration of the PESF Program. \n49.  Revisions to Investment Regulation. In 2007, parliament enacted a new investment \nlaw that replaced the separate laws on foreign and domestic investment dating from 1967 and \n1968, and provides a single legislative framework for domestic and foreign investment, a long \nstanding objective that has featured in the Government's policy dialogue with ADB since 1998. \nArticle 12 of the new law states that all business activities not explicitly closed or restricted to \ninvestment are open, and that restrictions must be listed in a presidential regulation. This is the \nfirst time that an Indonesian law has required a single comprehensive investment negative list, \nissued by the President, and it is the first clear statement in law that activities not included in the \nlist are fully open to investment. However, the subsequent implementing decree (Presidential \nRegulation  No.  77/2007)  on  the  negative  list  received  a  mixed  reaction  from  investors.  It \nincluded  a  grandfather  clause  for  foreign  investors  that  exceed  foreign  equity  limits,  but \nuncertainties and differing interpretations created new forms of investor uncertainty. Additional \nuncertainty has also emanated from the Government\u2019s failure to follow up on its announcement \nthat it would change a long-standing policy of not applying the investment negative list to \npublicly listed companies\u2014creating widespread uncertainty among listed companies at a time \nwhen the domestic capital market is under severe pressure. Recognizing these regulatory \nuncertainties and the need to boost investor confidence, the Government has prepared a draft \nrevision to Presidential Regulation No. 77/2007 that clarifies the rules and relaxes restrictions in \nkey sectors \n50.  Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. The Government recognizes that the \nsteady decline in exploration and investment in the oil sector is partly caused by uncertainty \n ", "  25\nover rules on tax treatment and production sharing. To address this, the Government has \ninitiated  the  accession  process  to  sign  up  to  and  implement  the  Extractive  Industries \nTransparency Initiative (EITI). It has sent a formal letter to the EITI secretariat to initiate the \nprocess.  Three ministries, CMEA, MOF, and Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, have \nissued a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to set up the institution that will drive EITI \nimplementation. The implementation process will take about 2 years. In 2009, efforts will include \npreliminary meetings of the steering group, establishing its secretariat, developing a work plan \nand securing resources for implementation, and acceptance of Indonesia as an EITI candidate \ncountry. In 2010, an independent reconciler will design reporting templates and build capacity to \nfill in reporting templates, and the Government and industry will submit the templates to the \nsteering group. The process which will lead to greater clarity in regulations, rules, and revenue \nreporting will improve transparency and boost investor sentiment in the oil, gas, and mining \nsectors over the medium term.  \n51.  Trade Finance. The Government has taken both short- and longer-term measures to \naddress trade finance issues. In the short term, it has activated its rediscount window for trade \nreceivables. The rediscount window is not envisaged as credit coverage but as a mechanism to \nincrease dollar liquidity. The mechanism works as follows: the exporter sells its accepted letter \nof credit to Bank Indonesia at a small discount, allowing the exporter receivables in advance. \nThe facility has a minimum letter of credit value of $10,000 allowing small and medium-sized \nenterprises to access the rediscount window. The letter of credit must be issued from an \noverseas bank with a AAA rating from Standard and Poor\u2019s credit rating agency. \n52.  Export Financing Agency. The Law No. 2/2009 on the establishment of an export \nfinancing agency was promulgated in January 2009 aimed at improving trade finance over the \nmedium term. Under the new law, the current Bank Ekspor Indonesia (a commercial bank) will \nbe converted into an export financing agency within 9 months. The agency will be responsible \nfor developing trade finance products to improve trade, including trade finance guarantees. Its \nmandate also includes promoting trade to nontraditional markets. This initiative is supported by \nthe proposed Trade Finance Facilitation Program.11 Indonesia is one of the priority countries to \nbe  supported  under  the  Program.  Discussions  on  implementation  of  the  Trade  Finance \nFacilitation Program with financial institutions are ongoing, and operations are expected to start \nin the second half of 2009. \nC.  Financing Plan \n \n53.  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $1  billion  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources for the PESF Program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of \n3 years, with an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility and a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum;12 and such other terms and conditions \nas are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft program loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n54.  Gross financing needs of the Government have increased from $18.2 billion in 2008 to \n$24.6 billion in 2009 based on the revised 2009 budget. These growing financing needs reflect \nincreased levels of domestic and foreign debt principal repayments, and changes to the 2009 \nbudget (Table 2). The revised 2009 budget projects a lower increase in revenues because of \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2009.

Manila (Loan 2033-REG). \n12 The Board has reduced the commitment charge to 0.15%, and waived the front-end fee of 1.00% for loans \napproved from 1 July 2007 up to and including 30 June 2009. \n ", "26    \n \nthe economic slowdown, and the need for additional spending to stimulate the economy in 2009 \nand for poverty alleviation programs. The revised budget protects social sector spending, in \nparticular education and funding for the flagship community-based poverty alleviation program, \nto provide a cushion for adversely affected households. Overall, the Government is budgeting \nfor additional spending and counter-cyclical spending up to Rp73.2 trillion in 2009. According to \nits financing plan (Table 3), the Government indicated that gross financing of $24.6. billion will \nbe met from the following sources: (i) $9.1 billion from issuance of domestic and international \nbond issuance in the markets, (ii) $6.3 billion from the banking system and excess financing \nfrom  2008,  (iii)  $5.2  billion  from  the  Official  Development  Assistance  program  and  project \nlending; and (iv) $4.1 billion additional financing. The Government will draw down the PESF and \nrelated support from other development partners when it cannot meet its financing targets from \nthe markets within specified market access conditions specified in the Government\u2019s financing \nplan (paras. 40\u201342) and other conditions set out in the loan agreement.  \n \nTable 3: Projected Financing Requirements of the Government of Indonesia for 2009 \n($ billion) \n \nProposed \nFinancing Mix   Amount \nGross Financing Requirements  24.61 \nLess Amortization   10.64 \n   \nNet Financing Requirement            13.97 \nProgrammed Gross External Borrowings              7.24 \nof which:   \nADB\u2019s Proposed Loan Pipeline              0.75 \nDevelopment Policy Support Program               0.20 \nIndonesia Infrastructure Financing Facility              0.10 \nCapital Market Development (Subprogram 2)              0.30 \nNational Community Empowerment Project  0.07 \nMetropolitan Sanitation Project  0.05 \nJava Bali Distribution  Performance Improvement   0.04 \nOther Donors and Commercial Borrowings              6.73 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nNote: Exchange rate: $1 = Rp11.000. \nSources: Ministry of Finance and ADB estimates. \n \n55.  The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under \nADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an \nundertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not made in reliance on \nany communication or advice from ADB. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n56.  The Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs (CMEA) will be the Program Executing \nAgency. MOF, Ministry of Trade (MOT), Coordinating Ministry for Social Welfare (CMSW), and \nBAPPENAS  will  be  the  Implementing  Agencies.  CMEA,  as  the  Executing  Agency,  will  be \nresponsible for overall Program implementation and coordination; it will be supported by the \nImplementing  Agencies  (MOF,  MOT,  CMSW,  and  BAPPENAS).  The  Government  has \nestablished  a  program  steering  committee,  chaired  by  the  director  general  of  the  Debt \nManagement Office (MOF); and comprising representatives from CMEA, MOF, and BAPPENAS, \nand each development partner cofinancing the PESF. The committee will meet in the first week \n ", "  27\nof each quarter to review implementation of the Government\u2019s financing plan and assess and \ndetermine  the  Government\u2019s  financing  shortfalls.  CMEA  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day \nprogram implementation activities, and will report on implementation progress to ADB. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n57.  The program implementation period for the PESF is from 1 September 2008, when the \nturmoil in global financial markets began, to 31 December 2010. The support package for 2010 \nis subject to the Government\u2019s submission of its 2010 financing plan. All actions included in the \npolicy matrix were implemented from September 2008 to March 2009. \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements \n \n58.  The program loan of $1 billion will be released as a single tranche loan with scheduled \nand multiple withdrawals to be made over the program period on the condition that, prior to each \nwithdrawal (i) the Government has met the drawdown triggers set out in the financing plan, \n(ii) the Government has maintained an appropriate macroeconomic framework, and (iii) the \nGovernment continues to fulfill the agreed policy actions and has not committed any actions \nwhich reversed the objective of the Program. The scheduled withdrawals from the tranche will \nbe made in accordance with the fiscal financing needs of the Government on a quarterly basis \nover fiscal years 2009 and 2010. Prior to each withdrawal under the tranche, the Government, \nADB, and development partners will agree that all of the required drawdown triggers have been \nmet. The loan proceeds will be used to finance the full foreign exchange costs (excluding local \nduties and taxes) of items produced and procured in ADB member countries, no more than 180 \ndays before the effectiveness date of the loan. Items specified in the list of ineligible items \n(Appendix 7) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources are excluded. In \naccordance  with  the  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Simplification  of  Disbursement  Procedures  and \nRelated  Requirements  for  Program  Loans,13 the  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  to  the \nGovernment of Indonesia as the Borrower. No supporting import documentation will be required \nif during each year that loan proceeds are expected to be disbursed, the value of Indonesia\u2019s \ntotal imports minus imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed \nunder other official development assistance is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan \nexpected to be disbursed during such year. The Government will certify its compliance with this \nformula  with  each  withdrawal  request.  Otherwise,  import  documentation  under  existing \nprocedures will be required. Disbursements will be made under the simplified procedures for \nprogram  loans.  In  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and  related \nrequirements  for  program  loans,  all  goods  and  services  produced  and  originating  in  ADB \nmember  countries  will  be  procured,  with  due  consideration  to  economy  and  efficiency,  in \naccordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector \ncommercial  practices  acceptable  to  ADB.  Goods  commonly  traded  on  the  international \ncommodity market will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB. If at the end of the Program there are unwithdrawn loan amounts, the \nGovernment and/or ADB can cancel the unwithdrawn amounts.  \n \n59.  The  reform  needs  supported  under  the  PESF  will  be  financed  by  local  currency \ncounterpart funds generated from the proceeds of the program loan.  \n \n                                                 \n13 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila \n ", "28    \n \n4.  Anticorruption and Fiduciary Issues \n60.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations \nand the bidding documents for the Program. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in \nconnection with the Program shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and \nexamine the records and accounts of the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, \nconsultants, and other service provides as they relate to the Program. \n \n61.  A core component of the Indonesian DPSP series focuses on strengthening public \nfinancial  management  and  improving  budget  preparation,  execution,  transparency  and \naccountability.  The  public  financial  management  systems  in  Indonesia  have  strengths  and \nweaknesses. Strengths include a sound regulatory framework across most parts of the budget \ncycle; an orderly, transparent, and predictable budget formulation process; fund predictability for \nbudget  execution;  sound  budget  classification;  comprehensive  and  transparent  budget \ndocumentation;  government  accounting  standards  aligned  with  comparable  international \nstandards; a chart of accounts that is broadly consistent with Government Finance Statistics \nManual 2001 (GFSM); and a strengthened external audit institution.   \n \n62.  The fiduciary assessment for the PESF Program draws on recent economic and sector \nwork undertaken by the World Bank,14 ADB,15 and other development partners (Appendix 8). \nThe fiduciary assessments undertaken in 2008 have indicated considerable improvements in \nthe overall fiduciary environment in Indonesia since 2001. Ongoing programs supported by \nseveral development partners provide significant technical assistance support to strengthen \nfiduciary governance. The PESF Program has benefited from these past and ongoing reforms. \nAt the same time, the PESF introduces additional measures to strengthen the public financial \nmanagement  system  to  ensure  timely  disbursements  necessary  to  mitigate  the  adverse \nsituation on growth and poverty. \n \n5.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n63.  ADB retains the right to audit the use of loan proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s  certification  for  withdrawal  applications.  Before  the  first  withdrawal,  the \nGovernment will open a deposit account at the central bank (Bank Indonesia) to receive loan \nproceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated in accordance with terms \nsatisfactory to ADB.  \n \n6.  Performance Monitoring, Evaluation, and Program Review \n \n64.  ADB, with the Government and other development partners cofinancing the PESF, will \ncarry  out  quarterly  reviews  of  program  implementation,  and  assess  the  shortfall  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s financing requirements as set out in the financing plan. The Government will \n                                                 \n14  World Bank. 2008. Public Expenditure and Financial Assessment, Report No. 42098 ID,  Washington, D.C.

Manila \n \n \n ", "  29\nkeep ADB informed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral \nagencies that have implications for PESF implementation, and provide ADB with the opportunity \nto comment on any resulting policy proposals. ADB, in collaboration with the steering committee, \nwill undertake a review of the Program every quarter after loan effectiveness to review the \noutcome of the PESF.  \n \n65.  The Government and its development partners have agreed on the updated outcome \nand output indicators to monitor PESF implementation and evaluate its impact, within the overall \nPESF framework (Appendix 1). \n \nV.  PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Expected Impacts \n \n66.  The key benefits expected from the PESF are to allow the Government to mobilize \nresources from commercial markets by \n \n(i)  reassuring financial markets and maintaining financial system stability; \n(ii)  ensuring that the Government can meet its financing requirements of its budget \nand any additional stimulus required if the economic slowdown is sharper than \nexpected; \n(iii)  ensuring that the Government can maintain its momentum toward achieving its \nmedium-term development objectives while managing the negative impacts of \nthe international credit crunch on Indonesia\u2019s access to credit markets and the \neconomic slowdown by (a) reassuring financial markets and maintaining financial \nsystem  stability,  (b)  mitigating  the  poverty  impacts  of  the  growth  slowdown, \n(c) sustaining critical public expenditures while maintaining budget discipline, and \n(d) crowding in private investment and supporting exports; \n(iv)  aiding harmonization and cofinancing by the key development partners (ADB, \nWorld Bank, and the governments of Japan and Australia) around a common \npolicy matrix and dialogue, and the resulting endorsement of the Government\u2019s \nmacroeconomic  management  and  response  to  the  externalities  of  the \ninternational credit crunch; and \n(v)  enabling the Government to attract capital from private sources and lower the \nGovernment\u2019s cost of funding. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n67.  The PESF is subject to the following risks: \n \n(i)  External vulnerabilities. The risks remain high, especially during a period of \nglobal  financial  turmoil  and  uncertainty  and  the  ongoing  international  credit \ncrunch,  and  now  the  emerging  second  round  effects  of  a  sharp  economic \nslowdown. Indonesia is a financially open economy and there are significant \nforeign holdings, especially in the stock market and government bonds which \nhave only been repatriated partially to date. Indonesia continues to be vulnerable \nto shifts in investor liquidity needs as deleveraging proceeds in North America \nand Europe. If significant funds are pulled back because of liquidity demands by \ninvestors in these areas and/or increased emerging market risk aversion, this \ncould lead to increased pressure on international reserves and/or exchange rates, \nas well as on the domestic money market. In addition, the Government has large \n ", "30    \n \ngross financing needs over the next few years, and tighter credit markets and \nincreased risk aversion could severely limit its ability to tap international financial \nmarkets. This could force the Government to cut budgetary outlays to maintain \nfiscal balance, even after full access to the PESF, with adverse consequences \nfor infrastructure and social expenditure. Mitigating these risks will require solid \ncooperation between the central bank and the economic ministries to reassure \nbondholders that their investments are safe (from inflation and exchange rate \nmovements) while crowding in private investment to the extent possible through \nthe kinds of reforms supported by the PESF. \n \n(ii)  Sharp  economic  slowdown.  In  January  2009,  the  Government  revised  its \ngrowth projection from 6% to 5% in January and again to 4.5% in March 2009 as \nthe economy was beginning to deteriorate. These growth projections are likely to \nbe revised downward as more evidence emerges of the magnitude of the global \neconomic  slowdown  over  the  next  several  weeks.  This  will  affect  revenue \ncollections and require further revisions to the 2009 budget and financing plan. \nThe PESF provides fiscal flexibility by providing for further fiscal expansion as \nallowed for in the agreed financing plan.  \n \n(iii)  Fiduciary constraints. Notwithstanding the improvements under way, there are \ncontinuing  concerns  regarding  utilization  of  public  resources.  The  overall \nfiduciary  assessments  undertaken  since  2001  (with  the  Country  Financial \nAccountability Assessment) have indicated considerable improvements in the \nfiduciary environment in Indonesia (Appendix 8). Ongoing programs supported \nby several development partners provide significant technical assistance support \nto  strengthen  fiduciary  governance.  The  PESF  inclusion  of  strengthening \nbudgetary  procedures  and  controls  will  significantly  enhance  transparency, \nespecially in financial management. \n \n(iv)  Legislative  and  presidential  elections  in  2009.  The  Government  remains \ncommitted to sustaining its economic reform agenda despite the global economic \nrecession,  the  international  credit  crunch  and  general  elections  next  year. \nUnfortunately, elections often reduce the time horizons of politicians, leading \nthem to avoid new policy initiatives in the pre-election period and shifting their \nfocus to populist short-term measures. This could undermine the reform agenda \nsupported by the PESF. Conversely, the prospect of elections could spur political \naction into ensuring that critical government expenditures and accompanying \nreforms  are  undertaken  to  demonstrate  a  continued  and  clear  record  of \naccomplishments. The Program guards against reversals in the policy actions by \nlinking  scheduled  withdrawals  of  the  loan  amount  to  maintaining  intact  the \nprogram measures and broad objectives. \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n68.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  Counterpart funds will be used to finance the local currency costs relating to the \nimplementation of the Program and other activities consistent with the objectives \nof the Program and will provide the necessary budget appropriations to finance \n ", "  31\nthe structural adjustment costs relating to the implementation of reforms under \nthe Program. \n \n(ii)  The policies and actions taken prior to the PESF loan agreement, as described in \nthe development policy letter (including the policy matrix), will continue to be in \neffect for the duration of the Program and subsequently. \n \n(iii)  The Government will keep ADB informed of, and the Government and ADB will \nfrom time to time exchange views on, sector issues and policy reforms that may \nbe considered necessary or desirable, including the progress made in carrying \nout policies and actions set out in the policy letter and the policy matrix. \n \n(iv)  The  Government  will  promptly  discuss  with  ADB  problems  and  constraints \nencountered during implementation of the Program and appropriate measures to \novercome or mitigate such problems and constraints. \n \n(v)  The  Government  will  keep  ADB  informed  of  policy  discussions  with  other \nmultilateral or bilateral agencies that have implications for implementation of the \nProgram, and will provide ADB with an opportunity to comment on any resulting \npolicy proposals. The Borrower will consider ADB\u2019s views before finalizing and \nimplementing any such proposals. \n \nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n69.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$1,000,000,000  to  the  Republic  of  Indonesia  for  the  Public  Expenditure  Support  Facility \nProgram from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest to be determined in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 15 years, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board; and on \nsuch terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in this report, \nand as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n      Haruhiko Kuroda \n      President  \n \n30 April 2009 \n ", "32  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources and/or   \nDesign  Performance Targets  Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nAdverse economic and social  Real GDP growth  Central Bureau of  Continued Government \nimpact of the global financial  sustained at an  Statistics  strong commitment for \ncrisis mitigated   average of more than  (i) national income  reforms \n  5% over 2009\u20132011  accounts   \n     \nPoverty incidence  (ii) annual National  Global economy begins to \nreduced from 15.1%  Socioeconomic  recover from the financial \nin 2008 to 12.0% in  Survey (Susenas)  crisis at the beginning of \n2011    2010 \n   \nRisk \nWeak implementation of \nreforms   \nOutcome      Assumption \nAdequate access to budget  Supplementary  Ministry of Finance  Inflation pressure eases \nfinancing for critical  budget approved to  budget reports   \nexpenditure and required  include fiscal stimulus     \ncounter-cyclical fiscal policy  of at least 1.3% of     \nsecured  GDP     \n      Risks \n  Government\u2019s 2009  Minutes of the PESF  Counter-cyclical fiscal \nbudget financing  quarterly meeting  policy insufficient to \nneeds from the market  endorsed by  mitigate growth slowdown \nof Rp139.5 trillion  development partners   \nobtained  and government   \n     \nYields on Republic of  Debt management  Crisis policy responses \nIndonesia sovereign  office reports to the  are not well coordinated \nbonds reduced toward  PESF committee  and weak administrative \npre-September 2008    capacities hinder \nlevels (average yields  acceleration of \non 5-year bond in  procurement timetable \n2008 = 10.24%; yields  and timely disbursements \nin January 2009 =   \n11.85%)  Renewed global financial \n  turmoil leads to further \nglobal credit crunch  \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.

The sector analysis assesses the recent macroeconomic developments and provides \nthe  background  to  identification  of  issues  and  threats  faced  by  the  Government  from  the \nongoing global financial crisis in achieving its development objectives to maintain progress in \nenhancing macroeconomic stability and reducing poverty.  \n \nA.  Real Sector and Inflation \n \n2.  Economic Performance. Indonesia enters the global financial crisis with respectable \neconomic  performance.  Economic  growth  accelerated  to  a  10-year  high  of  6.3%  in  2007. \nDespite unstable global financial markets and a slowing world economy, Indonesia did not \nexperience a growth slowdown in the first half of 2008 and economic growth remained strong at \n6.1% in the third quarter (Q3) (Figure A4.1[a]). Available estimates suggest that growth in Q4 \nremained relatively robust, bringing economic growth to about 6% in 2008. Economic growth \nhas  become  broader  based,  with  a  strong  pickup  in  investment  and  stronger  export \nperformance  attributed  to  high  prices  of  commodities  during  the  first  half  of  the  year \n(Figure A4.1[b]). Economic growth since 2006 appears to have been more employment friendly \nsince unemployment declined from 10.3% in 2006 to 8.3% in 2008 (Figure A4.1[c]). The poverty \nrate has also fallen significantly, reaching the pre-crisis level of 16.6% in 2007 and falling further \nto 15.4% in 2008.  \n \n3.  Looking ahead, global growth is expected to slow sharply to its lowest pace since the \n2001 recession, and global financial conditions are expected to tighten further. The International \nMonetary Fund (IMF)1 revised its forecasts in January 2009 and suggested that global growth \nwould fall to 0.5% in 2009 from 3.8% in 2008. Against uncertainties in the financial markets, \nactivities in the advanced economies are expected to contract by 2%. Economic growth in \nemerging and developing economies is also expected to slow sharply to 3.2% from 6.2% in \n2008 because of falling export demand, lower commodity prices, and much tighter external \nfinancing constraints. The global economy is projected to experience gradual recovery in 2010, \nbut the outlook is highly uncertain. Against this backdrop, economic growth in Indonesia is \nexpected to decelerate in 2009 because of a projected sharp reduction in external demand for \nexports. The recent decline in commodity prices will also have a negative impact on Indonesia. \nProjected  decline  in  capital  inflows,  particularly  foreign  direct  investment,  would  constrain \ninvestment. Private consumption, the largest source of growth, would be hurt by more sluggish \nearning, expected higher levels of unemployment and underemployment, and public desire to \nsave during uncertain times. The Government plans to introduce a modest fiscal stimulus to \nprevent a sharp economic slowdown, which could significantly reverse progress in reducing \npoverty.  \n \n4.  Inflation. While inflation has been a major concern since the start of 2008, the pressure \nhas eased since Q3 2008. Like in many countries in the region, inflationary pressure was driven \nby largely external factors related to escalating international prices of food and commodities \n(Figure A4.1[d]). Domestic factors also contributed as lending to the private sector grew by over \n30% in Q3 2008. In response to the rising inflation, Bank Indonesia progressively increased its \nrate by 150 basis points to 9.50% in October 2008. However, year-on-year Consumer Price \nIndex (CPI) inflation fell from a peak of 12.1% in August to 7.9% by March 2009.

Financial Sector  \n \n5.  Stock Markets and the Rupiah. Indonesia\u2019s stock markets and the rupiah have been \nadversely affected by the global financial crisis.  After being one of the best performers in \nSoutheast Asia in 2007, the stock market index (JSX) experienced very large correction in 2008. \nAs of 30 December 2008, the stock market index had plummeted more than 50% for the year, \nwith over a quarter of the decline occurring since early October (Figure A4.2[a]). After moving \nbroadly stable against the US dollar since mid-2006, the rupiah came under pressure from early \nOctober to late November and depreciated by more than 30%. The rupiah has recovered part of \nthe  loss  and  stabilized  around  Rp11,000\u2013Rp12,000  per  $1  since  December  2008 \n(Figure A4.2[b]). Initially, Bank Indonesia intervened heavily in the spot market in September \nand October, driven in part by concerns that a large depreciation of the rupiah would risk \n ", "   Appendix 4  49\ntriggering domestic capital flight. Subsequently, Bank Indonesia reduced its net intervention in \nNovember and allowed the rupiah to find its new equilibrium. The public adjusted well to a \nsignificant depreciation of the rupiah and the feared domestic capital flight did not occur. The \nforeign reserve position of Bank Indonesia has remained relatively stable since November 2008.  \nFigure A4.2: Financial Sector Performance \n \n  (a) JSX Composite Index                                    (b) Rupiah Exchange Rate against US Dollar  \n \n3000 13000\n \n \n2500 12000\n \n \n2000 11000\n \n  1500 10000\n \n  1000 9000\n \n  500 8000\n       J  a n - 0  8      A  p r -0  8      J u  l- 0 8       O  c t - 0 8      J a  n - 0 9                Jan-08 Apr-08 Jul-08 Oct-08 Jan-09\n                                                                                  \n    (c) Banking System CAR and NPL                       (d) Banking System LDR and Liquidity     \n \n  90 25\n25 10   80\n  70 20\n20 8\n  60\n15\n  15 6 50\n  10 4 40 RHS 10\n  RHS 30\n  5 2 20 5\n10\n \n0 0 0 0\n  Jan- Jul- Jan- Jul- Jan- Jul- Jan- Jul- Jan-\nJan- Jul- Jan- Jul- Jan- Jul- Jan- Jul- Jan-\n            0 5      0 5      0  6      0 6      0 7      0  7    08 08 09\n05 05 06 06 07 07 08 08 09\n  CAR NPL\nLDR Liquidity\n \nCAR = capital adequacy ratio, JSX = stock market index, LDR = loan to deposit ratio, NPL = nonperforming loan \nratio. \nSources: Bank Indonesia and CEIC Data Company Ltd. \n \n6.  Domestic Banking System. The direct impacts of the global financial crisis on the \ndomestic  banking  system  have  been  limited  so  far.  The  banking  system  has  not  been \nsignificantly affected by direct effects of the global crisis because of limited direct investment in \ntroubled US assets. The banking system, which accounts for nearly 80% of the financial sector\u2019s \nassets, remains relatively strong. As shown in Figure A4.2(c), the average capital adequacy \nratio of the banking system has declined slightly since early 2008, but remained relatively high \nat 18% in February 2009. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) increased slightly relative to end-2008 \nbut remained low at 4.3% in February 2009. After declining to around 14% in October 1008, the \nliquidity\u2013assets  ratio  has  improved  marginally  to  16%  in  February  2009  (Figure A4.2[d]). \nHowever, the banking sector is expected to face new challenges going forward. US dollar \nliquidity in the banking system has remained very tight since September 2008 due to capital \noutflow. Projected weakening economic growth going forward would affect corporations and \n ", "50  Appendix 4 \nresult in rising NPLs and erosion of bank capital. Nonbank financial institutions have also \nfinanced a large proportion of their borrowing needs from foreign sources, so they will be \naffected by the tightening global financial market. These corporations will need to rely more on \ndomestic lending in future, which could tighten liquidity further. Moreover, given Indonesia\u2019s \nexposure to externally mobile capital, continued volatility in international financial markets and \nspikes in global risk aversion could cause further disruptive capital outflows.  \n7.  Government Policy Response. The Government is well aware of the challenges ahead \nand has taken a number of proactive measures. To reduce the likelihood of further disruption \nand maintain the stability of the financial system, the President of Indonesia issued the financial \nsafety net regulation to establish clearly the roles, responsibilities, and procedures that govern \nthe actions and responses of Bank Indonesia, Ministry of Finance, and Deposit Insurance \nCorporation in the event of the failure of a financial institution. The Government also issued \nGovernment Regulation No. 66/2008 to increase the ceiling on deposit insurance from Rp100 \nmillion to Rp2 billion, while giving the Government the authority to raise the deposit insurance \nceiling further or issue a blanket universal guarantee quickly if circumstances demand. These \nmeasures have, to date, helped maintain the stability of the Indonesian banking system. In the \nrecent case of a small nonsystemic bank failure, the measures empowered the regulatory \nauthorities to take control of the situation quickly. Monetary policy moved to ease liquidity, \nincluding December\u2019s cut in interest rates. Bank Indonesia has also introduced a rediscount \nwindow for trade finance. This facility would facilitate exporters to repatriate export earnings to \nhelp with domestic US dollar liquidity and encourage them to deal with high-rated international \nfinancial institutions for safety. \n \nC.  External Sector  \n \n8.  Balance of Payments. The balance of payments surplus is expected to decline amid \nthe pressure from the global financial crisis. Indonesia recoded a balance of payments surplus \nof 2.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 and remained robust in the first half of 2008 \n(Figure  A4.3[a]).  The  global  financial  crisis  has  put  increased  pressure  on  the  balance  of \npayments. Exports year-on-year have started to decline sharply since December because of \nfalling  commodity  prices  and  a  slowdown  in  demand  from  developed  countries.  Although \ndeclining, imports remained relatively strong during the same period because of the need for \nmaterials and capital goods (Figure A4.3[b]). As a result, the balance of payment surplus \nreceded  significantly  at  the  end  of  2008.  The  capital  and  financial  accounts  worsened \nconsiderably as negative sentiment spurred by the global financial crisis prompted a large \ncapital outflow in October. Part of the outflow, however, was compensated by large official \ncapital inflows in December.    \n9.  Public and Private Sectors. Overall, exposure of both the private and public sectors \nappears manageable. Indonesian firms have increasingly financed their investment through \nretained earnings, and leverage ratios in the corporate sector have fallen. The IMF estimates \nthat Indonesian firms obtained almost half of their external financing from foreign sources in \n2007.2 This exposure makes firms vulnerable to rollover risks if the current global financial \nmarket conditions continue. Bank Indonesia Bank suggests that about $22 billion of short-term \npublic and private external debt due in 2009.

Capital  Flight.  The  global  financial  crisis  has  heightened  the  risk  of  capital  flight \nsignificantly. Indonesia is more vulnerable to capital flight because of its relatively open capital \naccount  and  significant  foreign  presence  in  its  stock  and  bond  markets.  While  significant \namounts of external capital have already been withdrawn from the country\u2019s financial markets, \nIndonesia remains vulnerable to further capital flight. Foreigners still holds around 14%, or \nRp9 trillion,  of  the  stock  of  government  bonds.  In  addition,  domestic  investors  have  been \nsensitive to exchange rate movements, which could be triggered by another cycle of foreign \ncapital repatriation caused by liquidity demands and rising risk. Although experience in January \nto March 2009 suggests that domestic investors have started to adjust to larger exchange rate \nmovements, it is too early to be certain. While nonbank financial corporations are believed to \nhave  reasonably  well-diversified  sources  of  finance  and  not  to  be  significantly  leveraged, \nexperience indicates that domestic capital markets are quite volatile and subject to sudden \nchanges in sentiment originating in domestic and international markets. In addition, the size of \nthe Government\u2019s gross financing needs could still pose risks despite the country\u2019s strong fiscal \nposition. In brief, prolonged instability in international financial markets and protracted recession \nepisodes in developed countries may pose challenges to the country\u2019s balance of payments.  \n \nD.  Fiscal Sector and Debt Sustainability \n \n11.  Budget. The Government almost achieved a balance budget in 2008. An early estimate \nof the central government budget outturn for 2008 suggests that the budget deficit is reduced to \n0.1% of GDP, compared with 1.3% of GDP in 2007. The improvement in the Government\u2019s \nbudgetary position reflects continued fiscal discipline, policy actions to address energy subsidies, \nand significant progress in improving tax collections. In May 2008, the Government raised \nsubsidized fuel prices by an average of 29%, relieving some of the budgetary burden of soaring \n ", "52  Appendix 4 \noil  prices.  Significant  growth  in  government  revenue  collection  since  late  2007  has  also \nstrengthened Indonesia\u2019s fiscal position. Total tax revenues in 2008 were about 34% higher \nthan  tax  revenues  in  2007  levels  because  (i)  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  improve  tax \nadministration and tax registration expanded the tax base through the Sunset Policy, (ii)  tax \noffice  internal  personnel  management  improved,  (iii)  targeting  of  special  taxpayers  was \nenhanced, and (iv) efforts to resolve a backlog of value-added tax refunds led to artificially low \nvalue-added tax revenues in 2007. The Sunset Policy encourages the public to have a tax file \nnumber and allows them to pay incorrect tax returns from previous years without penalty. \nTherefore, part of the increased revenue collection in 2008 is expected to be one-off. \n \n12.  Budget Law. The 2009 budget law passed in November 2008 continued the spirit of \nfiscal discipline, while containing a number of positive measures. To reduce its financing needs, \nthe Government initially targeted a budget deficit of 1% of GDP. The budget contains provisions \nto  ensure  that  priority  publicly  funded  infrastructure  projects  are  financed  even  if  market \nconditions  are  unfavorable.  The  budget  also  protects  social  sector  spending,  in  particular \nfunding for the flagship community-based poverty alleviation facility, to provide a cushion for \nhouseholds that are adversely affected by any growth slowdown. Article 23 of the Budget Law \nprovides the Government with flexibility to provide a fiscal stimulus in the face of a likely growth \nslowdown, while continuing to maintain fiscal discipline.  \n \n13.  The 2009 budget was based on more optimistic economic growth, higher oil prices, and \nstronger  rupiah.  With  projected  weakening  growth  in  2009,  a  depreciated  rupiah,  and \nsignificantly lower oil prices, the Government revised the budget assumptions in January 2009. \nAlthough the revision helps the expenditure side, through a reduction in government spending \non subsidies and transfers to the subnational governments (Rp60.7 trillion), its impact on the \nrevenue side is much bigger\u2014tax revenue declines by Rp64.1 trillion and nontax revenue \ndeclines by Rp73.1 trillion. The net effect of the revision is a higher budget deficit of Rp139.5 \ntrillion (2.5% of GDP). While part of the increased deficit under the revised budget will be \nfinanced by the excess financing of 2008 of about Rp51.3 trillion, the revision requires additional \nbudget financing of about Rp36.9 trillion ($3.4 billion) relative to the budget.  \n  \n14.  Budgetary Costs of Energy Subsidies. In the 2009 budget, the Government took a \nfurther  innovative  step  to  try  to  contain  the  budgetary  costs  of  energy  subsidies.  The \nGovernment is using the current low international fuel prices to educate the public about the \nbenefit of linking domestic prices to movements in international prices. The sharp fall in oil \nprices through November and December 2008 has allowed the Government to reduce domestic \ngasoline and diesel prices three times. Effective implementation of a well-designed domestic \nfuel pricing mechanism would contribute to lowering the fiscal risks from the energy policies. In \naddition, in 2009 the Government will reduce the effective base for regional transfers by the total \namount of all subsidies being provided. The measure will effectively reduce the energy subsidy \ncost by 26% for the central Government, while aligning the incentives of regional governments \nin supporting the reduction of fuel subsidies.  \n \n15.  Public Debt. The consistent prudent fiscal policy has enabled Indonesia to reduce its \npublic debt burden significantly. In the past 5 years, Indonesia\u2019s public debt\u2013GDP ratio has \nfallen sharply, from over 55% in 2004 to around 32% at the end of 2008. Debt sustainability \nanalysis jointly prepared by the IMF and World Bank staff suggest that, under the baseline \nscenario of continued historical growth and low budget deficit, the debt\u2013GDP ratio will decline \n ", "   Appendix 4  53\nfurther in 2012.3 Under most types of extreme shocks, Indonesia\u2019s debt levels and servicing \nobligations would remain within most thresholds for concern (Figure A4.4). For example, with a \none-time 30% real depreciation of the rupiah, the debt\u2013GDP ratio would increase debt levels by \na little over 10% of GDP. A reduction in future growth by one standard deviation will increase \nthe debt\u2013GDP ratio by around 8%. As noted earlier, despite the country\u2019s strong fiscal position, \ngovernment finances have been especially vulnerable to spikes in global risk aversion and \ncontagion from external markets because of the country\u2019s large gross financing needs. The term \nstructure of Indonesia\u2019s bonds led to sharply higher turnover in 2007 and 2008, and amortization \nis projected to remain at high levels through 2011 (Table A4). \nFigure A4.4: Government Debt and Its Sustainability  \n \n \n  (a) Debt-to-GDP Ratio                                              (b) Debt Sustainability Analysis  \n60\n50\n50\n45\n40\n40\n30\n35\n20\n30\n10\n25\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\n0\nBaseline 30% Depreciation\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Lower Growth by 1SD\n  1SD = One standard deviation                                                                                \nSources: Ministry of Finance, the World Bank,and International Monetary Fund.\n \nTable A4: Principal Payment \n(Rp trillion) \nITEM  2009  2010  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020  2021  2022  2023  2024 \nPrincipal Payment of: \nForeign Loan  74.4  60.3  53.4  51.8  53.3  52.2  51.8  46.5  39.5  37.7  35.5  33.5  27.4  21.1  15.6  12.3 \nForeign Securities  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  14.2  10.1  9.8  10.9  20.8  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 \nDomestic Securities  42.0  40.6  43.8  46.9  47.5  30.2  38.9  29.9  33.8  37.8  37.5  45.9  26.9  34.8  33.3  19.1 \n                                 \nInterest Payment of: \nForeign Loan  20.5  17.8  15.8  14.0  12.2  10.4  8.8  7.7  6.0  4.9  3.9  3.0  2.2  1.6  1.2  0.9 \nForeign Securities  8.9  8.9  8.9  8.9  8.9  8.5  7.6  6.8  6.1  5.0  4.3  4.3  4.3  4.3  4.3  4.3 \nDomestic Securities  52.7  49.7  46.2  41.4  36.4  32.4  29.0  26.2  24.3  22.0  19.6  16.7  12.8  10.9  8.7  6.4 \n\u2013 = data not available. \nSource: Ministry of Finance.\n                                                 \n3  World Bank. 2009.

The sector analysis assesses recent developments in Indonesia\u2019s labor market and \npoverty reduction efforts, and provides estimates of the potential impact of the current adverse \neconomic situation on these indicators. It also provides the background to identification of \nissues and policy options. Employment creation and poverty reduction are the Government\u2019s \ntwo key policy priorities. In its Medium-Term Development Plan 2004\u20132009, the Government\u2019s \ngoal  is  to  reduce  unemployment  to  5%  and  poverty  to  14%  by  the  end  of  this  year. \nImprovements in the business climate, infrastructure, and social policy spending are central to \nits strategy. However, achieving these goals of lower poverty and unemployment in 2009 is now \nunlikely and the indicators are expected to deteriorate given the current adverse economic \nconditions.   \n \nA.  Recent Labor Market Performance \n \n2.  Sluggish  Labor  Market.  Figure A5.1: Regional Unemployment Rates \nIndonesia experienced a decade of  (%) \nsluggish  labor  market  performance   \nafter  the  Asian  financial  crisis  of   \n14.0\n1997\u20131998.

This added an additional 3 million persons to the unemployment figures and \nproduced an unemployment rate of 11.2% in 2005. Figure A5.1 shows that this rate approached \nlevels in the Philippines, and was considerably higher than rates in other Asian economies \naffected by the crisis (Korea, Rep. of, Malaysia, and Thailand). This was partly because the \nfaster pace of manufacturing growth in the other countries created a large number of jobs and \nhelped to absorb the growing labor force. \n \n3.  Other  Weaknesses.  Aggregate  employment  masked  further  weaknesses  in  labor \nmarket  performance.  In  a  dualistic  labor  surplus  economy  like  Indonesia\u2019s,  labor  market \nweaknesses show up in diverging trends between the formal and informal sectors and across \neconomic sectors\u2014not in aggregate employment (or unemployment and underemployment) \nfigures. Formal wage employment (defined as regular and casual wage employment) expanded \nby 0.8% per annum from 2001 to early 2006, with regular wage employment declining by 0.7% \nper annum despite some recovery since 2004.1 In contrast, informal employment expanded by \n                                                 \n1  Prior to 2001, BPS defined wage employment as comprising regular wage employees and agriculture casual wage \nemployees. In 2001, it separated the two types of wageworkers. \n ", "Appendix 5  55\nan average of 1.9% per annum.2 Indonesia\u2019s performance was disappointing in terms of poor \njob recovery. It also contrasted with the pre-crisis years when high investment, including foreign \ndirect investment, combined with export-led growth, was a major source of employment creation. \nDuring  those  years,  real  wages  increased  as  labor  moved  from  low  productivity  jobs  in \nagriculture and traditional services to higher productivity jobs in modern manufacturing and \nservices. Figure A5.2 shows where new labor force entrants found (or did not find) jobs in pre- \nand post-crisis periods. From 1991 to 1997, two-thirds of new job seekers found jobs in the \nformal  sector,  about  16%  entered  informal  sector  activities,  and  the  remainder  became \nunemployed. These trends were reversed after the crisis, with 55% of new job seekers entering \nthe informal sector, 11% becoming unemployed, and only 33% finding jobs in the higher paying \nformal sector.  \n \n4.

Labor market rigidities\u2014most \nimportantly minimum wages and severance costs\u2014were cited in the USAID-GIAT survey as \namong the key factors inhibiting investment in labor-intensive sectors. Minimum wages have \nrisen substantially in the post-crisis period, increasing by more than 50% in real terms in some \nmajor  industrial  centers  from  2000  to  2003,  but  moderated  from  2004  to  2008.  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) staff estimates suggest that minimum wage increases in Indonesia do \nnot affect employment in the short term (less than 12 months) for most groups of workers, but  \nreduce  employment  of  youths,  females,  and  low  educated  workers  in  the  longer  term.5 \nSeverance pay is another major rigidity in the labor market. Rates have more than doubled \nsince 1996 and are now among the highest in the region (Table A5.1). Severance regulation \nhas discouraged employers from engaging workers on a permanent basis. \n \n7.  In this context of relatively rigid labor market policies, a sharp slowdown in the economy \nis likely to lead to job losses in the formal sector and rising youth unemployment. BAPPENAS \nprojects that under different growth scenarios, unemployment could rise between 500,000 and \n1,000,000 persons in 2009, mainly youth unemployment. Job losses are likely to first occur in \nthe  export  sector  (especially  in  labor-intensive  sectors  such  as  garments,  footwear,  and \nelectronics) and later in services, as the economic slowdown becomes more broad-based by \nmid-2009. Anecdotal evidence suggests that job losses are occurring at a rapid rate in some \nsectors,  such  as  garments.  Data  collected  from  the  Department  of  Manpower  and \nTransmigration show 14,000 job losses in the garment center of Bandung in West Java in \nJanuary alone, and several thousands of workers have been laid off in Jakarta and East Java in \nrecent weeks, indicating that the worst effects may be based in urban centers.    \n \nB.  Policies to Boost Employment \n \n8.  Fiscal Expansion. In the short term, the Government\u2019s fiscal expansion will save some \njobs. Under its fiscal stimulus package, the Government has temporarily removed income tax on \nwages of less than Rp5 million per month in the manufacturing and agriculture sectors, and this \n                                                 \n3 National Development Planning Agency, 2003.

The Government has also allocated \nfunding to some of its poverty reduction programs which have employment components, such \nas the national community empowerment program (PNPM). This should create some jobs but \nthese will be insufficient to offset expected losses in the export sector over the coming months. \nThe Government\u2019s focus will be to provide assistance to families vulnerable to poverty as a \nresult of job losses. The newly established poverty monitoring unit at BAPPENAS will collect \ntimely employment data by region and sector, which will aid policy makers to develop timely \nmitigating  responses.  The  extension  of  the  unconditional  cash  transfer  (UCT)  program, \namounting to $345 million to the first quarter (Q1) of 2009, will also provide some assistance to \nfamilies that are vulnerable to falling into poverty because of job losses. This program may be \nextended to several months. However, sustained economic growth above 6% is necessary to \ngenerate sufficient jobs in the modern sector to absorb new job entrants in the market over the \nnext decade. Therefore, with the likelihood that the global economy will not begin recovery until \nlater in 2010, jobs losses are expected to continue over the next 18 months.   \n \n9.  Policy Reform. Over the longer term, reforms to labor market policies will be necessary \nto boost formal employment. In May 2006, the Government proposed a comprehensive labor \npolicy reform program as part of its \u201cwhite paper\u201d to improve the investment climate. Reforms \nincluding reducing severance rates, allowing fixed-term contracts cumulatively up to 5 years \nbefore employee conversion to permanent status, permitting outsourcing to core activities, and \nlinking wage adjustments to productivity are critical for employment creation. Major unions \nrallied  against  the  proposals  in  May  2006.  In  response,  the  Government  postponed \nimplementation of reforms. There is less appetite for such reforms under current economic \nconditions, and in an election year. Nevertheless, over the longer term, reforms to severance \npay and fixed-term contract arrangements will be necessary to boost job recovery once the \nglobal economic crisis subsides. \n   \nC.

The proportion of the population vulnerable to falling into poverty remains high at around \n46% of the population, based on the $2 a day poverty rate. Modest shocks to family income\u2014\nsuch as drought and other natural disasters, and high inflation\u2014can push millions of families \ninto poverty as about 30% of the population resides slightly above the poverty line. Public \nservices remain inadequate for a middle-income country, and the other dimensions of poverty \nare also major problems in terms of high malnutrition and maternal mortality rates, inadequate \naccess  to  safe  water  and  sanitation,  and  insufficient  education  outcomes.  Access  to  rural \ninfrastructure is limited.

This program was reactivated in 2008 in response to the surge \nin inflation. About 19 million families were covered by the UCT in 2008. Preliminary data from \nthe  2008  Susenas  indicate  that  the  UCT  program  has  been  effective  in  keeping  60%  of \nhousehold  recipients  from  falling  into  poverty  in  2007  and  30%  of  recipients  had  actually \nescaped  poverty.  The  Government  is  also  piloting  the  conditional  cash  transfer  program, \nwhereby transfers are linked to family progress in child school attendance and child health \nindicators. Currently, the program covers six provinces and 1 million families although progress \ntoward a national rollout has been slow because of institutional capacity constraints at the \nsubnational  level.  Since  2004,  real  spending  on  education  and  health  in  the  national  and \nsubnational budgets have increased substantially as part of the Government\u2019s medium-term \nobjective of universal education and health.  \n \n13.  Poverty Impact of Financial Crisis. The current adverse economic situation threatens \nto reverse recent gains in poverty reduction. The economy is expected to slow down in 2009, \nwith growth projections ranging from 2.0% to 4.5%. Exports in January declined by 36% on a \nyear-on-year  basis,  suggesting  that  the  lower  end  of  projections  is  an  increasingly  likely \noutcome  for  2009.  BAPPENAS  estimates  that,  under  its  low-growth  scenario  (4%),  about \n5 million additional persons will need social assistance during the downturn (about 2% of the \npopulation)  in  2009.  If  economic  growth  falls  to  2%,  these  numbers  will  be  much  higher. \nMoreover,  a  slowing  economy  reduces  government  revenues  which  in  turn  threaten  the \nGovernment\u2019s efforts to protect the large increases in social spending made in the last 2 years.  \n \n ", "Appendix 5  59\nD.  Policies to Mitigate the Worst Effects of the Global Financial Crisis \n \n14.  The Government is acutely aware that the current adverse economic situation threatens \nsubstantial gains made in reducing poverty in recent years. In response to these threats, and to \nprotect social spending, it will permit an increase in the budget deficit from an initial 1.0% of \nGDP  to  2.5%  of  GDP  in  2009.  This  larger  deficit  allows  for  a  fiscal  stimulus  through  a \nsupplementary budget approved by parliament in February 2009. To this effort, the Government \nintends to scale up its poverty alleviation programs under the supplementary budget. These \ninclude increasing the coverage of the subsidized rice program (Raskins), school scholarship \nprogram, extending the UCT into 2009 at a cost of at least $345 million, and the PNPM. In \naddition, under the Public Expenditure Support Facility, the Government has established a \npoverty monitoring unit and a coordination mechanism to be able to assess social economic \ndata quickly and respond with programs to assist vulnerable families.  \n \n ", "60  Appendix 6\n   \n \n         \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nCountry/Project Title:  Indonesia/Public Expenditure Support Facility Program \n \nSoutheast Asia Department/ \nLending/Financing  Department/ \nPolicy-based program loan  Financial  Sector,  Public  Management  and  Trade \nModality:  Division: \nDivision \n       \nI.

SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \nAccording to data from the 2008 National Socioeconomic Survey (Susenas), the Government's unconditional cash transfer \nprogram (UCT) maintained the welfare levels of 60% of household UCT recipients and assisted 30% of recipient households \nto escape from poverty, while about 10% of recipient households fell into poverty because of food price inflation in 2008.

Background and Analytical Underpinnings \n \n1.  The PESF provides general budget support to the Government and will be executed \nthrough the Government\u2019s public financial management systems. This assessment summarizes \nthe current state of these systems and ongoing reforms, with a view to assessing the fiduciary \nrisks related to this development policy loan.  \n2.  The public financial management systems in Indonesia have strengths and weaknesses. \nThe strengths include a sound regulatory framework for most parts of the budget cycle; an \norderly, transparent, and predictable budget formulation process; fund predictability for budget \nexecution; sound budget classification; comprehensive and transparent budget documentation; \ngovernment accounting standards that are aligned with comparable international standards; a \nchart of accounts that is broadly consistent with Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) \n2001; and a strengthened external audit institution.   \n3.  These strong points are the result of a concerted reform effort among key stakeholders \nto the budget process since the political transition in 1998. These efforts were given momentum \nand direction in the 2001 white paper on public financial management reform. Key stakeholders \nto the budget process remain committed to further reform through an evolving and pragmatic \nreform agenda. The focus of government reform is on the implementation of an integrated \nfinancial management information system, further unification of the budget, further improvement \nof the chart of accounts, restructuring of budget programs, the introduction of a medium-term \nexpenditure framework and performance-based budgeting, full rollout of the treasury single \naccount (TSA), improvement of the institutional and regulatory framework for procurement, \nimprovements to cash and asset management, internal controls, and internal and external audit.   \n4.  The DPL/DPSP series has had public financial management as an area of focus and \nhas contributed to significant improvements in the last few years. This assessment draws on \nrecent economic and sector work undertaken by the World Bank, Asian Development Bank \n(ADB),2 and other development partners. This includes a Public Expenditure and Financial \nAssessment  (PEFA)  concluded  in  June 2008, 3  a  joint  World  Bank\u2013IMF  mission  on \nStrengthening  Budget  Management  undertaken  in  June  2008,  a  previous  joint  Bank-Fund \nmission  on  Budget  Reform  Priorities  reported  to  the  Government  in  June  2007,  and  the \nSeptember 2008 update of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes on Fiscal \nTransparency  in  Indonesia  from  2006.4 It  also  draws  on  the  ongoing  policy  dialogue  and \nadvisory  services  provided  through  the  Government  Financial  Management  and  Revenue \nAdministration  Project  (GFMRAP)  and  the  associated  Public  Financial  Management  (PFM) \nMulti-Donor Trust Fund.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 This Appendix has been extracted from ADB. 2008.

(September) \n ", "64   Appendix 8 \nB.  Key PFM Issues\u2014Recent Developments and the Way Ahead \n \n5.  Significant advances have been made in budget preparation\u2014instituting a state budget, \nwhich combines the previous separate recurrent and development budgets, and improvements \nin budget transparency. However, problems in budget execution persist, with 50% of capital \nexpenditure  still  being  spent  in  the  last  quarter.  The  Director  General  (DG)  Treasury  has \nconducted  a  survey  of  the  impediments  to  the  disbursement  of  budgetary  funds  through \nquestionnaires. The results of the survey are being reviewed and will form the basis of an action \nplan to smooth out disbursements during the fiscal year.  \n \n6.  Implementation of a TSA, as foreseen by State Treasury Law No. 1/2004, is ongoing. \nThe Treasury, in cooperation with Bank Indonesia, has tested the daily sweep of government \nrevenue deposits from collecting branches and post offices into the TSA. Depending on the \nsuccess of the pilot test, the daily sweep will be extended to all commercial bank branches. The \npublic procurement environment has witnessed improvements in the last few years. However, \nthere are still weaknesses in its regulatory and implementation aspects. Presidential Regulation \nNo. 106/2007 was signed in December 2007 establishing an independent agency National \nPublic  Procurement  Office  (LKPP)  that  is  responsible  for  planning  and  development  of \nstrategies, policies, and regulations associated with procurement using public funds. It is a \npriority  to  make  the  newly  established  LKPP  operational  by  recruiting  staff  and  allocating \nbudget.   \n7.  The Government Accounting Standards are well aligned with comparable international \nstandards,  and  the  chart  of  accounts  is  broadly  consistent  with  GFSM  2001.  Aggregate \ngovernment annual financial statements have been prepared in a timely manner for 4 years but \nthere are questions of reliability. The Supreme Audit Agency (BPK) has for the last 4 years \nissued a \u201cdisclaimer\u201d opinion on these financial statements. Internal control weaknesses in the \npreparation  of  the  financial  statements  and  instances  of  noncompliance  with  applicable \nregulations were cited among the reasons for the disclaimer.   \n8.  The Government\u2019s internal audit framework is extensive but the institutional structure is \ncomplex. Government Regulation No. 60/2008 on the Government\u2019s Internal Controls defines \nmore clearly the roles and responsibilities of the different players in internal audit. The overall \ninternal control framework continues to be weak, with paper-intensive processes and inefficient \nuse of human resources. The Government is preparing for the implementation of an integrated \nfinancial  management  system  known  as  SPAN  to  replace  the  multitude  of  financial  data \nprocessing applications currently used by government institutions.   \n \n9.  The external audit institution, BPK, has received a significant increase in its operating \nbudget to fund an increase in the number of auditors as well as regional offices. The audit report \non the financial statements is submitted to legislature within 5 months after the end of the year.   \n \n10.  Powerful independent oversight and prosecutorial institutions such as the Corruption \nEradication Commission (KPK) and the Anti-Corruption Court have begun to deliver tangible \nresults.  High-profile  corruption  investigations  have  been  launched,  leading  to  a  number  of \nsuccessful prosecutions.   \n \n11.  Parliamentary  oversight  of  budget  processes  has  been  strengthened.  Parliamentary \ncommissions have become particularly active in scrutinizing and amending the Government\u2019s \ndraft  annual  budget.  The  Government  published  an  IMF  fiscal  transparency  report  and \ndisseminated  throughout  Indonesia.  The  public  availability  of  fiscal  information  is  already \n ", "                          Appendix 8        6  5\nimproving and the Government has published a fiscal risk statement together with the 2008 and \n2009 budgets.    \n \n12.  These reforms directly influence the environment in which public expenditure is planned, \nbudgeted,  executed,  and  accounted  for  across  all  levels  of  government.  A  more  detailed \ncommentary on progress in implementing these reforms is given below to help identify the \nattendant risks arising from the Borrower\u2019s capacity to manage this loan and determine the \nfiduciary arrangements for this operation.  \n \nC.  Reforming Budget Formulation \n \n13.  Fiscal  relationships  between  the  executive  and  legislature  are  defined  in  the  State \nFinance Law No. 17/2003. The House of Representatives (DPR) is the principal legislative body \nand it plays a significant role in shaping budget and fiscal policy. The budget is passed by \nagreement between the President and the DPR. The process involves an examination by the \nDPR of the macroeconomic framework, macro-fiscal policies, and detailed budget allocations. \nThe budget has been the centerpiece of strengthening the legislature vis-\u00e0-vis the executive in \nthe political transition following 1998, and the relative roles of the executive and legislative \nbranches in this area are evolving. \n \n14.  The  budget  documentation  is  comprehensive.  The  main  outstanding  area  of \nimprovement is explanation of the expenditure implications of new policy initiatives. The laws \ngoverning budget management clearly specify the responsibilities of the minister of finance, and \ncomprehensive  regulations  have  been  developed.  While  the  President,  as  head  of  the \nGovernment, has overall authority to exercise national fiscal management, Law No. 17/2003 \nclearly delegates the responsibility of overall fiscal management of central government finances \nto the minister of finance as chief financial officer. The law also assigns responsibilities to \nindividual  ministers,  governors,  and  other  local  authorities  for  financial  management  and \naccountability in their jurisdictions. \n15.  Provisions of the new regulations are being implemented. Budget classification and \nexecution is based on administrative, economic, and functional classification consistent with \nGFSM 2001. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) is developing plans for a medium-term expenditure \nframework to guide budget policy. Forward estimates at the aggregate level were introduced \nwith the 2008 and 2009 budgets. Efforts in BAPPENAS and MOF are ongoing to redefine the \nbudget program structure, and develop templates and manuals for a medium-term expenditure \nframework and performance-based budgeting. The efforts are planned to be pilot tested in the \ncoming years.  \n \n16.  The level of extra-budgetary expenditures is not known and the issue is not on the \nreform agenda.  \n \nD.  Reforming Budget Execution \n \n17.  Indonesia still spends 50% of its total capital expenditure in the final quarter of the year.5 \nFor the past 6 years, spending has started slowly and then accelerated toward the end of the \nyear. This spending pattern is of concern because project implementation is disrupted by an \nadverse  cycle.  Moreover,  under-spending  on  capital  expenditure  constrains  increases  in \n                                                 \n5  World Bank. 2007. Indonesia Public Expenditure Review 2007: Spending for Development. Washington, D.C.: \nWorld Bank. \n ", "66   Appendix 8 \ninfrastructure investments. Slow and back-loaded disbursements are symptoms of more severe \nchallenges that are encountered at each stage of the public expenditure management cycle. \n18.  The Government maintains a comparatively rigid budget execution process. Detailed \ninput controls aim to ensure that the composition of the budget complies with political priorities \nand that the budget is not altered during execution. Spending warrants (DIPAs), while now \nissued at the start of the fiscal year, contain excessive amounts of detail\u2014leaving little flexibility \nfor adjustments in the composition of inputs needed to carry out a given activity. Reallocations \nacross DIPAs from delayed programs to better-performing ones that could enhance satisfactory \nimplementation of the overall expenditure program require lengthy revision, sometimes involving \nparliament. Such inflexibility creates practical difficulties and inefficiencies. \n19.  With expanding fiscal space, public investment is increasing, putting additional pressure \non PFM systems. Planning and executing public investment is inherently more demanding than \ncurrent or mandatory expenditure.  \n \nE.  Reforming Treasury, Cash, and Asset Management \n \n20.  Transparency is still weakened by a multitude of bank accounts. The Director General \nTreasury itself maintains multiple bank accounts, both in rupiah and foreign currency, at Bank \nIndonesia. External audit reports from 2004 to 2006 noted that around 4,600 bank accounts \nhave not been reported to the DG Treasury. By the end of December 2007, MOF completed a \ncensus of all government accounts and identified 32,570 accounts. Some 2,086 accounts were \nsubsequently  closed  and  efforts  are  ongoing  to  determine  which  of  the  remaining \n30,484 accounts can be included in the TSA regime, either directly or through a mechanism of \ndaily sweeps into the TSA.  \n \n21.  Regulations associated with Law No. 1/2004 will address this weakness and provide for \n(i) the installation of a TSA at Bank Indonesia; (ii) the conversion of operational bank accounts \nat commercial banks into zero-balance transit accounts; and (iii) a mandatory review at MOF of \nbank accounts of all state agencies outside DG Treasury oversight.. Pilot runs for testing zero-\nbalance  arrangements  with  commercial  banks  for  the  expenditure  accounts  have  been \nsuccessful. Rollout of the TSA to the revenue accounts, which was initially scheduled for the \nfirst quarter (Q1) of 2008, has been postponed. This is due to pending negotiations with Bank \nIndonesia and commercial banks on interest payments for government balances held at Bank \nIndonesia, and remuneration of banking services by the Government. The daily sweep will cover \ndeposits made the previous day\u2014not on the same day\u2014since commercial banks have agreed \nnot to charge for this service provided the sweep is done the following day. This would be a \nsignificant  improvement  to  the  current  practice,  established  in  1989,  of  sweeping  revenue \naccounts twice a week. \n \n22.  The implementing regulation for Law No. 1/2004, Government Regulation No. 36/2007 \non Cash Management, was issued in July 2007 detailing the governance and setup of cash \nmanagement. In addition, a number of MOF regulations (PMK) have been issued to further \nestablishment of the TSA: \n(i)  PMK 57 is the generic PMK to regulate opening of bank accounts by the line \nministries.  \n(ii)  PMK 58 mandates a census of the existing line ministry accounts.  \n(iii)  PMK 59 mandates senior officers (echelon I) of MOF to disclose bank accounts, \nif any are being operated.  \n ", "                          Appendix 8        6  7\n23.  The  cash-based  accounting  system  generates  timely  records  of  revenue  and \nexpenditure  transactions,  but  does  not  track  monthly  arrears.  Transaction  records  are \nelectronically  transmitted  to  the  directorate  of  accounts  at  DG  Treasury  headquarters  for \nconsolidation and generation of periodic reports on budget execution. However, DG Treasury \nplans to move toward an accrual recording system, which would make this possible. \n24.  MOF is preparing the implementation of an integrated financial management system to \nreplace the multitude of financial data processing applications currently used by government \ninstitutions. The system is known as SPAN. It will integrate and replace the multiple software \napplications within the Treasury as well as those being implemented in the DG Budget to \nsupport  the  budget  formulation  process.  Following  some  delay,  the  second  stage  bidding \nprocess for SPAN was initiated in August 2008 and the contract for provision of turnkey services \nfor SPAN is expected to be signed by April 2009. A new management and implementation \nstructure for the project is now being established.  \n \n25.  Government  assets  are  not  comprehensively  recorded,  properly  organized,  or  fairly \nvalued.  An  integrated  and  automated  asset  management  system,  which  will  enable  the \nGovernment to optimize the use of its assets across ministries and regions, will be established \nin 2009.     \n \nF.  Procurement Reforms \n \n26.  The  past  few  years  have  witnessed  improvements  in  the  public  procurement \nenvironment.  Presidential  Decree  No.  80/2003  provided  a  national  public  procurement \nregulation that meets most of what is generally regarded as accepted international practice, \nincluding  the  basic  principles  of  transparency,  open  and  fair  competition,  economy,  and \nefficiency. This decree also requires the establishment of a national public procurement office \nas a regulatory body for public procurement. With the introduction of Keppres No. 80/2003, a \nprevious certification (\u201cpre-qualification\u201d) process for suppliers/providers of goods and services \nwas, in most instances, abandoned by the Government. This previously led to segmentation of \nthe market, especially at the provincial level. Keppres No. 80/2003 also established the basis for \nsanctions, complaint handling, and requirements for certification of users.  \n \n27.  However, the public procurement system still has significant deficiencies in its regulatory \nand, more importantly, implementation aspects. There have been delays in establishing a strong \nregulatory body; slow progress in the development of procurement regulations anchored by a \nlaw; slow progress in the development of standard tools in terms of bidding documents and \nusers manuals; weakness in procurement capacity in implementing agencies, especially at \nprovincial and district levels; and collusion and corruption practices in the bidding process as \nwell as concerns over the efficiency of anticorruption and sanction measures.  \n28.  This is supported by the findings of some analytical tools and reports, such as the self-\ndiagnostic assessment conducted by the LKPP in 2007, using the baseline indicators tool \ndeveloped  under  the  World  Bank  and  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment (OECD) Development Assistance Committee Procurement Round Table initiative. \nThe  assessment  of  the  baseline  indicators  presents  a  snapshot  comparison  of  the  actual \nsystem against the international standards or the \u201cmodel system\u201d that the baseline indicators \nrepresent. Baseline benchmarking of Indonesia\u2019s procurement system in June 2007 showed it \nscoring  62.5%  for  the  legislative  and  regulatory  framework  (pillar  I),  55%  for  institutional \nframework and management capacity (pillar II), 59.3% for procurement operations and market \npractices (pillar III), and 69% for integrity and transparency of the public procurement system \n ", "68   Appendix 8 \n(pillar IV) in comparison with recognized international standards. Other studies indicate that \nthere is significant room for improvement. \n29.  LKPP will report directly to the President of Indonesia. The organizational structure for \nthe new LKPP is being developed. In addition to the chair, who heads LKPP, and an executive \nsecretary, there will be four departments, each headed by a deputy with responsibilities for (i) \nstrategy  and  policy  development;  (ii)  monitoring,  evaluation,  and  information  systems;  (iii) \nhuman resources development; and (iv) legal affairs and settlement of objections. LKPP is \ncurrently staffing echelon II positions and is expected to fill all the staffing needs by the end of \n2009. \n30.  A  number  of  laws  have  been  enacted  since  2000  that  affect,  or  refer  to,  public \nprocurement. These include civil works, state finance, treasury, audit, and small-scale business. \nThe pace of Indonesia\u2019s decentralization reforms has impacted on public sector procurement at \nall levels of government\u2014ministers, governors, and even mayors are able to issue decrees, \nregulations,  and  instructions.  The  plethora  of  regulations  is  often  inconsistent  and  many \nregulations do not meet accepted international practice. Consequently, national procurement \nreform and the need for national procurement policies and standards are critical. \n31.  Indonesia\u2019s legal framework for public sector procurement can best be strengthened by \nanchoring  it  with  an  overarching  consolidated  and  comprehensive  national  public  sector \nprocurement  law  at  the  highest  level  that  (i)  establishes  the  fundamental  principles  and \nprocedures applicable to all public sector procurement; (ii) allows for the imposition of sanctions \nwhere the principles and procedures, particularly those relating to good governance and ethics, \nare not met; (iii) amends other laws that refer to public sector procurement; and (iv) ensures that \nsuch a law has the necessary authority in a decentralized environment.  LKPP is currently \ndrafting a procurement law with a projected time horizon of 2 years its enactment, as it needs to \ngo through a review and consultation process followed by submission to parliament. \n32.  In  the  meantime,  LKPP  has  consolidated  the  different  amendments  of  Keppres \nNo. 80/2003 into one document, which it plans to simplify for users. \n33.  Standard  Bidding  Documents.  No  national  standard  bidding  documents  are  used \nregularly by all government agencies in Indonesia. Some implementing agencies (such as the \nMinistry of Public Works) have developed standard bidding documents for their own use. The \nLKPP,  through  the  support  of  ADB,  has  drafted  eight  national  model  standard  bidding \ndocuments. These include (i) an explanatory guide, (ii) goods with prequalification, (iii) goods \nwith post-qualification, (iv) works with prequalification, (v) works with post-qualification, (vi) other \nservices with prequalification, (vii) other services with post-qualification, and (viii) consulting \nservices. These are available in a draft form but their use is not mandatory and they are being \nused on a pilot basis. It is important for LKPP to collect users\u2019 comments on these documents, \nimprove them, and mandate their use on a national basis. One of the improvements would be to \nharmonize such documents with those of international development partners such as the World \nBank, ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment. \n34.  Public  Procurement  Function.  There  has  been  growing  concern,  from  both  the \nGovernment and ADB, over the pace of project implementation. Significant delays and slow \ndisbursement  seem  to  occur  across  the  entire  PFM  cycle.  Government  agencies  reported \ndelays  and  difficulties  in  budget  preparation  and  approval,  budget  execution,  and \nimplementation/  procurement.  Specifically,  there  are  concerns  with  the \n ", "                          Appendix 8        6  9\nimplementation/procurement capacity of government staff and the absence of incentives for \nproject managers/procurement committees. In addition, fear of prosecution by auditors and \nanticorruption agencies has affected projects because of the reluctance of officials to take action \namid growing worries of being prosecuted under anticorruption legislation, even over minor \nmistakes.  LKPP  is  considering  assessing  the  introduction  of  central  procurement  units  in \nministries and at local government level.  \n \n35.  Capacity  Building.  Keppres  No.  80/2003  required  the  Government  to  adopt  an \nexamination  system  and  certification  for  procurement  practitioners  within  government \ncontracting entities to ensure that their level of competence is consistent with their level of \nresponsibilities. So far, the rate of staff passing the basic procurement certification is very low \n(less than 20%), which increases the need for a strategic approach to capacity building. LKPP is \ndeveloping a strategy for human resources, training, and certification on public procurement. \nThis will entail development of training courses and criteria for tertiary institutions.  \n \n36.  Corruption,  Sanctions,  and  Independent  Appeals  Mechanism.  Despite \nimprovements in the public procurement system, concerns remain over corrupt and collusive \npractices. While addressing this requires an overall governance strategy, several important \nelements  in  the  procurement  system  can  support  such  a  strategy,  e.g.,  an  independent \ncomplaints mechanism, an effective sanctions mechanism, and improving transparency in the \nprocurement process through the use of e-procurement.  \n \n37.  Keppres No. 80/2003 requires the establishment of a complaints handling mechanism. \nHowever,  this  is  not  set  up  independently  but  within  each  implementing  agency.  LKPP  is \ndeveloping  a  strategy  to  approach  complaints  handling.  While  it  is  imperative  to  develop \nprocedures for an independent complaints handling mechanism, LKPP should avoid becoming \nthe agency to which these complaints are addressed but rather develop a system and monitor \nits efficiency and reliability.  \n \n38.  e-Procurement.  The  Ministry  of  Public  Works,  Ministry  of  Communications  and \nInformation,  and  City  of  Surabaya  have  been  at  the  forefront  in  the  development  of  e-\ngovernment procurement technology. The LKPP was also taking the lead on behalf of the \nGovernment for implementation of e-government procurement in Indonesia at a national and \nsubnational level. It is now critical to develop a road map for implementation of e-government \nprocurement in Indonesia, setting the roles of different stakeholders, and the responsibility for \nensuring  minimum  interoperability  and  core  data  standards  for  the  various  e-government \nprocurement providers to comply with. \n \nG.  Accounting and Reporting on Budget Execution \n \n39.  The  Government\u2019s  aggregate  annual  financial statements  have  been  prepared  in  a \ntimely manner for 4 years (2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007). They present revenues, expenditures \nand transfers, surpluses/deficits, and financing aggregates compared with budget provisions. A \nbalance sheet and a cash flow statement are also presented, along with a full statement of \ngovernment accounting policy. Although the timeliness is a significant achievement, concerns \nremain over their reliability. BPK has for the last 4 years issued a \u201cdisclaimer\u201d opinion on these \nfinancial statements. Among the reasons cited for this were internal control weaknesses in the \npreparation  of  the  financial  statements  and  instances  of  noncompliance  with  applicable \nregulations.   \n \n ", "70   Appendix 8 \n40.  The government accounting standards are well aligned with comparable international \nstandards. However, technical capacity constraints limit the pace at which these standards can \nbe  implemented  at  all  levels  of  government,  including  line  ministries  and  subnational \ngovernments. Capacity constraints in the line ministries are being addressed through staff \ntraining via an ambitious training program that aims to train over 7,000 accounting staff\u2014at least \none staff member per budget spending units (satker)  by the end of FY2009.  \n \n41.  Monthly and quarterly reports on budget realization are produced by each ministry and \nsent to MOF for consolidation. A midyear unaudited report on budget realization is presented to \nthe DPR in July and is available to civil society. However, there are reconciliation issues \nbetween the budget realization reports of the Treasury and those of the ministries, departments, \nand  agencies  (MDAs).  These  differences  are  reported  as  a  suspense  item  in  the  budget \nrealization reports, which have been disclosed in the annual financial statements since 2004.   \n \n42.  The  Government  issued  Finance  Minister  Regulation  No.  171/PMK.05/2007  on \nAccounting System  for  Line  Ministries.  The  changes  brought  about  by  the  new  regulation \ninclude an emphasis on \n \n(i)  line  ministries  being  responsible  for  recording  the  budget  allotment  for  their \nministries; and  \n(ii)  receivables, payables,  and investment recording by the line ministries which \nshould be recorded and reported in the line ministries\u2019 financial statements.   \n \n43.  Based on the new regulations, line ministries will assume responsibility for their budget \nmonitoring\u2014they do not have to depend on MOF controls only\u2014and the financial statements of \nline ministries will present a more accurate picture of their financial position.   \n44.  Although  commendable  action  has  been  taken  to  improve  government  financial \nreporting, there continue to be serious challenges in making government financial statements \nreliable, as reported by BPK in its annual audit report for 2006. This reflects the immense \nchallenges that lie ahead in an environment where accounting capacity at the grassroots level is \nweak and accounting processes are not yet integrated or fully automated. \n \nH.  External Audit \n \n45.  BPK was established under the constitution and its roles and responsibilities are set out \nin Law No.15/2004. The organizational structure of BPK is outlined in the Decree of Secretary \nGeneral No. 34/2007 and No. 39/2007 and its governance arrangements were set out in Law \nNo. 15/2006. BPK has a mandate to audit all government entities including MDAs and state-\nowned enterprises (SOEs). Its independence from the executive branch is reflected in its board \nmembers being appointed by parliament. BPK has recently received a significant increase in its \noperating budget to fund an increase in the number of auditors and administrative staff as well \nas the number of regional offices.6  \n \n46.  All expenditures, revenues, assets, and liabilities of the Government are subject to audit \nby BPK. This situation has arisen from the requirements enacted in taxation laws (No. 6/1983 \nand No. 16/2000) under which only the minister of finance can authorize access to individual \n                                                 \n6  The total annual budget for BPK increased from Rp234 billion in 2004 to Rp1.5 trillion in 2008 while the number of \nregional offices increased from 7 (2004) to 29 (2008). \n ", "                          Appendix 8        7  1\ntaxpayer records, on a case-by-case basis. As a result, BPK has been unable to audit taxation \nrevenues, which represent about 70% of central government revenues. \n \n47.  BPK  performs  financial,  performance,  and  special  purpose  audits.  The  audits  are \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  the  BPK  Auditing  Standards,  which  are  stipulated  in  BPK \nRegulation No. 1/2007 on State Finance Auditing Standards. These standards are generally in \nline with international standards and have been applied since FY2006. The audit report on the \nfinancial statements is submitted to the legislature within 5 months after the end of the fiscal \nyear. In the past 4 years, the submission of the audited financial reports to parliament has been \ntimely. BPK also submits interim audit reports to parliament every 6 months on irregularities and \ninefficiencies it has identified at MDAs. \n \n48.  Auditees  generally  submit  formal  responses  on  audit  recommendations  and  their \nimplementation to BPK. The extent of follow-up is regularly monitored by BPK and reported in \nits interim audit reports. Records maintained at BPK indicate that, on average, 80% of audited \nentities submit formal responses on audit findings although this may not reflect the relative \nimportance of recommendations.  \n \n49.  A peer review of BPK was completed in 2004 and this revealed serious weaknesses in \ncapacity. Since then, improvements have been made gradually, with new hiring and training. \nBPK has a follow-up peer review planned for FY2009.   \n \nI.  Internal Controls and Internal Audit \n \n50.  The  internal  audit  framework  of  the  Government  is  extensive  but  the  institutional \nstructure is complex and the mandates and division of labor between the various internal audit \ninstitutions have not been clear. Presidential Regulation No. 60/2008 on government internal \ncontrols issued in August 2008 defines more clearly the roles and responsibilities of the different \nplayers.   \n \n51.  The  State  Development  Audit  Agency  (BPKP)  is  now  entrusted  with  the  task  of \ndesigning the guidelines on internal control implementation, providing training and improving the \ncompetence of the Government\u2019s internal auditors on the Government\u2019s internal controls\u2014\nessentially an advisory role. BPKP is also mandated to audit cross-sectoral activities, respond to \naudit requests by the President, and audit the Government\u2019s treasury activities if assigned by \nMOF.   \n \n52.  Inspectors general are still the main internal audit apparatus of the line ministries. In \nprinciple, inspectors general have a mandate to audit all MDAs activities and determine their \nannual audit plan independently and all units within an MDA are required to provide data \nneeded by inspectors general. In practice, most audits by inspectors general check compliance \nwith technical and operational aspects of activities, including compliance with internal control \nprocedures.  Evaluations  to  determine  the  adequacy  of  internal  control  systems  are  rarely \ncarried out. A systematic risk-based approach to internal audits is still in its infancy. Since 2006, \ninspectors general also have reviewed their MDA\u2019s annual financial statements to ensure their \naccuracy, reliability, and integrity prior to their submission to DG Treasury in MOF. \n \n53.  There was no formal commitment control system at satker and MDA level that records, \nreports, monitors, or controls spending commitments during the year against approved budgets \nand  cash  availability.  However,  Finance  Minister  Regulation  No  171/PMK.05/2007  on \n ", "72   Appendix 8 \nAccounting System for Line Ministries passes on the responsibility for commitment control to \nline  ministries.  The  DIPA  documents  prepared  by  MOF,  which  are  detailed  down  to  the \nspending unit or satker level, establish annual budget ceilings on expenditure commitments. \nThese DIPAs generally prevent MDAs from placing orders above the approved budgets (DIPA \nlimits) for particular spending items. \n \n54.  MOF  Regulation  No.  134/PMK.06/2005  and  DG  Treasury  Regulation  No.  PER-\n66/PB/2005 prescribe detailed procedures for payment of salary and non-salary expenditures, \nwhich supplement other written procedures on accounting and recording transactions. However, \nthe processes are paper-intensive and involve inefficient use of staff resources. For example, \nthe supporting documentation required for payment of goods and services covers multiple \ndocuments that duplicate information, with weak audit trails and accounting evidence.7 \n55.  BPK\u2019s audit report for 2006 records numerous instances of noncompliance with rules for \nprocessing and recording transactions such as noncompliance with procurement procedures, \npayments not supported by adequate documentation, and overpayments.   \n56.  In relation to subnational accounts, the auditing responsibility of is assigned to the \ninternal  auditor  of  local  governments  (Bawasda).  Lack  of  trained  and  skilled  auditors  and \nmethodology results in Bawasda being the weakest component of the Government\u2019s internal \ncontrol framework.  \n \n57.  The  overall  internal  control  environment  continues  to  be  weak.  However,  recent \nregulations  on  the  accountability  of  line  ministries  and  internal  control  are  positive \ndevelopments.  \n \nJ.  Reforming Regional Public Financial Management \n \n58.  Decentralization  has  provided  local  governments  with  significant  resources  and \nauthority.  More  than  one-third  of  general  government  expenditures  are  now  executed  by \nsubnational governments. This requires an adequate regulatory framework and PFM capacity at \nthe local level. After decentralization, the central Government passed comprehensive legislation \nfor PFM reforms at the regional level to mirror the changes being made at the center. The \nregulatory framework for regional PFM reforms is now largely in place, including mechanisms \nfor fiscal transfers to local governments. However, most regions lack adequate technical and \nhuman resources to implement the reforms. Subnational governments are obliged by law to \nreport certain fiscal and financial information to the central Government. Most local governments \nnow report the information required, although with some delay. Accordingly, it is possible to \nproduce consolidated (though delayed) general government reports. \n59.  Allocations  to  individual  subnational  government  units  are  formally  issued  with  the \npassing of the national budget in October before the financial year commences, but notional \nallocations are included in the budget presented to the DPR in August. In practice, this leaves \nsufficient time for subnational government units to finalize their budgets but submissions are \noften late because of local government constraints. However, budget allocations of shared \nrevenues (nontax revenue) are not issued before March or April in the fiscal year. The central \nGovernment significantly underestimates the notional allocations, and disbursements from the \ncenter to the regions are back-loaded toward the end of the fiscal year. Both practices are \n                                                 \n7  In the Government\u2019s view, the procedures may create some duplication of work. However, this approach is taken to \nmaintain a check and balance mechanism and clarify roles, as mandated by Law No. 1/2004 on State Treasury.  \n ", "                          Appendix 8        7  3\ndeliberately chosen by the central Government to ensure fiscal discipline, but they constrain \nsuccessful financial management at local level. \n60.  Because  of  over-budgeting  of  expenditure  by  subnational  governments  and  under-\nbudgeting of transfers by the central Government, many subnational governments have built up \nreserves in recent years.  \n \nK.  State-Owned Enterprises \n \n61.  Indonesia has a sound legal framework for corporate governance and monitoring SOE \noperations. Firstly, the SOE Law No. 19/2003 sets a clear ownership policy as the state is not \nallowed  to  be  involved  in  the  day-to-day  management  of  SOEs  and  must  allow  them  full \noperational autonomy. Secondly, a 2002 ministerial decree clearly details corporate governance \nresponsibilities, including the need to (i) submit each SOE\u2019s financial statements to the State \nMinistry  for  State-Owned  Enterprises  and  to  the  appropriate  line  ministry  each  quarter, \n(ii) prepare annual financial statements that must be audited internally and by an independent \nauditor, and (iii) publish SOE annual reports in a timely manner.  \n62.  Existing laws and regulations governing SOEs are not implemented effectively. Long \ndelays still occur in auditing and publishing SOE financial statements. SOE annual reports are \nusually only regularly and systematically made public in cases where companies have accessed \nthe  local  capital  markets  with  listed  instruments.  The  Government  has  included  fiscal  risk \nstatements in the budgets for FY2008 and FY2009 and is working on improving the quality of \nthe budget process.   \n63.  The planned use of public-private partnerships to accelerate investment will create fiscal \nrisks  that  merit  disclosure  and  the  Government  has  taken  steps  to  mitigate  those  risks. \nPresidential Regulation No. 67/2005 emphasizes careful project preparation and the selection of \nbidders in an open, competitive tender; and gives the minister of finance the right to approve or \nreject requests for government support. \n \nL.  Debt Management \n \n64.  During the previous DPL/DPSP series, two major initiatives in debt management were \nimplemented: a clear debt management strategy that was publicly announced, and a newly \ncreated DG for Public Debt Management that has risk management oversight for both domestic \nand external debts.   \n65.  By 2007, the Government had also successfully reduced its debt\u2013GDP ratio to about \n35% from the peak of over 90% in 1999. Despite the positive development in terms of debt \nsustainability and institutional reforms, the Government\u2019s institutional capacity to manage public \ndebt remains weak. Audit reports confirm that data and reports on domestic debt are reliable but \nindicate that data and reports on foreign debt differ from development partners records and may \nnot be accurate.  \n \nM.  Governance and Anticorruption \n \n66.  Indicators  of  corruption  in  Indonesia  are  improving,  albeit  slowly.  Sufficient  and \ndedicated resources have been made available to most of the agencies critical to anticorruption \nefforts. Powerful independent oversight and prosecutorial institutions such as KPK and the Anti-\nCorruption  Court  have  begun  to  deliver  tangible  results.  In  addition,  institutions  like  BPK, \n ", "74   Appendix 8 \nFinancial Transaction and Analysis Centre, and Attorney General\u2019s Office have all critically \nimproved their anticorruption track record. \n67.  High  profile  corruption  investigations  have  been  launched,  leading  to  a  number  of \nsuccessful prosecutions. For example, as of September 2008, seven parliamentary members \nwere under investigation or prosecution as suspects in several corruption cases, most of them \ninvolving bribery. Some of the parliamentary members were arrested when caught receiving \nbribes. A senior prosecutor has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for receiving bribes. This \ncase led to the removal of three very senior prosecutors, including two deputies of the attorney \ngeneral.  \n68.  While there have clearly been successes and there is strong momentum in investigating \nand prosecuting individual corruption cases, there has been less progress in developing and \nimplementing  a  coherent,  well-focused  strategy  for  corruption  prevention  within  the  state \nadministration.  Ministry  for  State  Apparatus  Reform  (MenPAN)  the  ministry  tasked  with \ncoordinating,  monitoring,  and  evaluating  implementation  of  such  a  strategy,  has  limited \ncapability in this regard. As a result, implementation of the existing anticorruption strategy for \nthe state administration has been weak.  \n69.  While progress in developing and implementing a coherent, well-focused strategy for \ncorruption prevention in the state administration is limited, recent developments have been \npromising. Previously, KPK was in charge of pushing and monitoring bureaucratic reform as a \ncorruption prevention measure within several institutions such as MOF, Supreme Court, and \nBPK. When this task was handed over to MenPAN in 2007, progress became very slow. \nDespite the limited progress by MenPAN, important internal bureaucratic reforms are well under \nway in individual government agencies including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of \nTrade, and most recently the Attorney General\u2019s Office. \n \nN.  Key Areas for Future Attention \n \n70.  Going forward, progress on the following key ongoing PFM reforms will need to be \nclosely monitored: \n(i)  ensuring coherence and momentum in PFM reform;  \n(ii)  deepening the reforms of the central government budgetary sector, along the \nlines discussed in paras. 66\u201369; \n(iii)  ensuring  greater  integrity  and  more  effective  management  of  public  funds \nthrough continued implementation of a TSA, automating the treasury payments \nsystem, and the institution of measures to prevent the proliferation of off-budget \nbank accounts; \n(iv)  strengthening internal audit institutions by establishing synergistic relationships \nbetween them, and removing overlaps; \n(v)  implementation  of  a  new  treasury  system,  extending  implementation  of \nGovernment Accounting Standards, and reengineering of underlying business \nprocesses at spending agencies to ensure reliable financial reporting; and \n(vi)  widening the reforms throughout government. This means extending modern \nfinancial accountability and management processes to subnational governments \nin a coordinated manner and bringing these fully in line with emerging national \nstandards.  \n ", "                          Appendix 8        7  5\n71.  Many  of  these  reforms  are  being  actively  considered  and  prioritized,  and  the \nGovernment is developing implementation plans. Implementation is well under way concerning \nthe TSA and the institutional framework for procurement.   \n72.  The capacity to monitor these and other reforms centrally has recently been established \nat the secretary general\u2019s office of MOF. Indonesia would benefit from a coherent reform plan or \nstrategy to ensure proper phasing and coordination of PFM reforms. This would also allow for \nenhanced monitoring and accountability within the Government, and thus provide additional \nmomentum and direction to reform efforts. \n \nO.  Management of Foreign Exchange \n73.  The foreign exchange control environment is assessed to be generally satisfactory. The \ncountry is no longer subject to the extended arrangement from the IMF. Bank Indonesia was \nlast subject to the transitional procedures under the Fund\u2019s safeguards assessment policy in \n2002. That assessment recommended remedial action to address a number of vulnerabilities in \nthe  audit  arrangements  of  Bank  Indonesia.  The  main  recommendations  have  been \nimplemented, including the establishment of an independent audit committee at Bank Indonesia \nand  the  publication  of  Bank  Indonesia\u2019s  audited  financial  statements.  Audited  financial \nstatements of Bank Indonesia for 2007 have been reviewed and the audit report issued by BPK \ncontained an unqualified audit opinion.   \n \nP.  Conclusion \n \n74.  Indonesia has established a sound legal and administrative framework for modern PFM. \nChanges in the legal and regulatory architecture are now largely complete and the momentum \nhas shifted toward implementation of new PFM practices.  \n \n75.  Known  weaknesses  in  financial  management  and  accountability  continue  to  be \naddressed gradually through the PFM reform program. The development partners are actively \nengaged in this process. Key elements of the reforms are supported by the DPL/DPSP triggers, \nas well as the GFMRAP project and initiatives supported by development partners. However, \nmuch remains to be done, and it will take time to realize the full impact of these reforms.   \n \n76.  In the meantime, some fiduciary risks will arise for this operation. Although the pace of \nimplementing the planned reforms has been somewhat slow over the past year, the trajectory of \nreform  is  in  the  right  direction  and  the  current  government  continues  to  demonstrate  a \ncommitment to continue the task of completing the planned reforms in PFM. Taking these into \nconsideration, ADB assessment team does not propose putting in place any additional fiduciary \narrangements for this operation. \n ", "76   Appendix 9 \nPUBLIC EXPENDITURE SUPPORT FACILITY PROBLEM TREE \n \n \nLower economic gro wth and poverty reduction \n   \n   \n   \n  Risks to spending  Risks to \n \nRisks to social  on public  employment and \n \nsafety nets  investment and  job creation \n \nservices \n \n \n   \n \n  Lower levels of \n   \nLower fiscal  private \n \nrevenues  investment \n \n \n   \n \n  Protracted economic downturn \n \n     \n \n      Reduced \n  Capital flight  Increased financial    availability of \n  sector instability  financing for \n  exports \n   \n   \n   \nHigher cost of \n \ncapital \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nContagion from \nglobal credit crunch \n \n \n \nSource:  Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20090512090105+08'00'", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 8.1.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20090811153552+08'00'", "Title": ""}, "author_page": "   \nSOE  \u2013  state-owned enterprise \nSusenas  \u2013  Survey Sosial-Ekonomi Nasional (National Socioeconomic Survey)  \nTSA  \u2013  treasury single account \nUCT  \u2013  unconditional cash transfer \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of the Government and its agencies ends on 31 December. \nFY  before  a  calendar  year  denotes  the  year  in  which  the  fiscal  year  ends, \ne.g., FY2009 ends on 31 December 2009. \n(ii)  In this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars.  \n \n \n \nVice-President  C.
