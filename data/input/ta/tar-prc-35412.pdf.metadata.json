Strengthening financial services to the agriculture sector1 and to rural nonfarm activities \nhas become a major policy objective of the Government of the People's Republic of China \n(PRC). Accordingly, the Government requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) during the \n2004 country programming meetings to provide advisory support for rural finance reforms and \nthe development of microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region \n(IMAR) and Guizhou Province. A fact-finding mission2 visited Beijing, IMAR, and Guizhou on 30 \nAugust\u201310 September 2004 and reached agreement with the Government on the objectives, \nscope, and implementation arrangements for the technical assistance (TA).3 The TA logical \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The rural financial system comprises the rural credit cooperatives (RCCs), Agricultural \nBank of China (ABC), and Agricultural Development Bank of China (ADBC). ADBC focuses only \non commercial grain and cotton production. ABC, with a mandate to operate as a purely \ncommercial bank, has been retreating from rural finance service provision. Thus, in many \nlocalities, RCCs are the only financial institution serving rural areas.4  \n \n3.  RCCs were established during the rural cooperative movement in the 1950s. They \naccount for 11.5% of deposits (CNY2,233 billion), 10% of loans outstanding (CNY1,618 billion) \nof the banking sector, and 85% of agriculture loans.5 RCCs have long been influenced by \nvarious levels of government and suffered from problems such as unclear ownership structure, \npoor corporate governance, inadequate business scope and internal control, poor administrative \nand supervisory framework, problems with staff capacity, heavy historical burden, poor asset \nquality,  and  dismal  financial  performance.6  RCCs  have  gone  through  several  rounds  of \nineffective restructuring.7  \n \n4.  After the shift of the bank and RCC supervisory function from the People\u2019s Bank of \nChina (PBC) to the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) in April 2003, it was clear \nthat neither PBC nor CBRC could administer RCCs while fulfilling their regulatory mandates. In \nJune 2003, the State Council issued a policy directive to commence a reform program aimed at \nfundamentally restructuring RCCs. The reform program had two objectives: (i) to clarify the \nownership structure and strengthen corporate governance for RCCs, and (ii) to transfer the \n                                                 \n1  i.e., rural economy, rural communities, and farmers. \n2  The mission had two teams. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) team comprised Y. Qian, principal \nfinancial economist; and C. Oh, governance specialist. The Guizhou team comprised B. Wilkinson, microfinance \nspecialist; L. Shen, financial economist; and T. Nguyen, economist. Both teams are from the Governance, Finance \nand Trade Division of the East and Central Asia Department.   \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 31 July 2004. \n4  ABC is closing its township and county branches. County branches can only take deposits and not sanction loans, \nwith the exception of policy-driven poverty reduction lending. \n5  The PRC has 32,397 RCCs with some 628,000 employees, 2,441 RCC unions (RCCUs) at the county level, 65 \nRCCUs at the prefecture level, and 6 RCCUs at provincial level. Agriculture loans outstanding by RCCs in June \n2003 amounted to CNY700 billion. Farmer loans amounted to CNY555 billion and microcredit loans amounted to \nCNY114 billion. \n6  By the end of 2001, the nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio of the RCC system was 44%: 46% of RCCs were making \nlosses; 58% had asset value less than liabilities, 53.3% had negative net worth (before counting NPLs written off), \nand 27% were facing serious financial difficulties. \n7  RCCs were under the overall administrative umbrella of ABC from late 1970s to the mid-1990s and were under \nPBC from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s.  \n ", "2  \nadministrative responsibilities to provincial governments, as well as resolve historic financial \nburdens. Seven provinces and one municipality were selected as the first batch for pilot testing \nthe reform, including Guizhou Province.8 \n \n5.  The  reform  allowed  the  transformation  of  RCCs  into  agriculture  commercial  banks \n(ACBs), agriculture cooperative banks (ACOBs), county-level consolidated structures made up \nof multiple township-level RCCs, or township-level institutions with a clear ownership structure. \nRCCs  with  serious  financial  problems  could  be  liquidated.  In  order  to  transfer  RCCs\u2019 \nadministrative responsibility to provincial governments and resolve balance-sheet issues, mainly \nin  the  form  of  nonperforming  loans  (NPLs),  Government  policy  recommended  establishing \nprovincial  RCC  unions  (RCCUs)  and  provided  financial  incentives  such  as  (i)  partial \ncompensation of losses from policy-driven subsidized loans, (ii) reduction of RCC corporate tax \nby 50\u2013100%, (iii) provision of special PBC refinancing loans, and (iv) provision of PBC notes \nredeemable upon meeting certain financial and operational criteria.9 Loan interest rates, now at \n200% of the base-lending rate prescribed by PBC, are more flexible.  \n \n6.  Results of the 2003 RCC reform have been generally positive.10 Thus, a full-scale \nimplementation of the reforms was announced by PBC and CBRC on 30 August 2004 for 21 \nadditional  provinces,  including  IMAR.11  During  this  second  phase,  a  number  of  problems \nexperienced in the first batch of pilot projects will need careful attention. These include (i) \nwrongly placed incentive structures due to the top-down approach by the central government; \n(ii) lack of participation by farmer-owners in the reform process and decreased participation in \nrestructured RCCs; (iii) unclear objectives and conflicts of interest at the provincial RCCUs; (iv) \nlack  of  progress  in  interest  rate  liberalization;  (v)  poor  corporate  governance  and  human \nresource  development;  (vi)  continued  capital  outflow  from  rural  areas;12  and  (vii)  lack  of \nalternative forms of rural finance other than RCCs; particularly in serving the poor.  \n \n7.  Given  the  importance  of  market  competition  and  the  need  to  service  poor  areas, \npolicymakers are contemplating alternative forms of financing, primarily MFIs. No policy or \nregulatory framework allows MFI operations, although numerous pilot programs have been \nimplemented in the past 10 years, providing CNY3 billion in microfinance loans. Outstanding \nmicrofinance  pilot  project  loans  amount  to  CNY300  million.  Interest  rates  range  from  the \nsubsidized rates of 3% per annum for Government-operated schemes to 16% per annum for \nMFIs that seek financial sustainability. MFIs have long been regarded as informal financial \ninstitutions by the Government and are being restricted for fear of financial market instability. In \n                                                 \n8  Guizhou, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Jilin, Shanxi, Shandong, and Zhejiang provinces, and Chongqing municipality. \n9  The amount of People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) special refinancing loans and redeemable notes is based on 50% of \nactual asset-liability balance after taking into account actual nonperforming asset (NPA) losses. The definition is \ncarried over losses (due to interest subsidies to depositors) + actual NPA losses \u2013 shareholders\u2019 equity \u2013 special \nprovisions. The actual NPA losses are calculated as 100% of bad loans + 40% of nonaccrual loans + 10% past due \nloans + 10% invested assets + 50% of loan collaterals. PBC refinancing loan will have a 3-, 5-, or 8-year term, and \nan interest rate half of reserve deposit rate. PBC redeemable notes will be for 2 years, with an interest no less than \nreserve deposit rate. The preliminary estimate indicates that the actual asset-liability balance of rural credit \ncooperatives (RCCs) nationwide should be in the range of negative CNY200\u2013250 billion, which means central \nGovernment financial support will be at least CNY100\u2013125 billion. \n10 These include (i) commercialization of RCCs and establishment of agriculture commercial and cooperative banks in \neconomically advanced areas, (ii) streamlined provincial administration of RCCs, (iii) expansion of capital bases, \n(iv)  reduction  of  historical  burdens  and  future  risks  through  NPL  resolution,  and  (v)  strengthened  financial \nperformance. \n11 Except for Tibet Autonomous Region, which does not have an RCC, and Hainan Province. \n12 RCCs were unable to attract more deposits as compared to postal savings and banks.  \n ", "  3\nmost localities, only RCCs maintain a regular but limited microcredit program.13 However, the \nGovernment has started to encourage microfinance.14 \n \n8.  IMAR is one of the PRC\u2019s largest provinces and autonomous regions with a total area of \nabout 1.18 million square km and a population of 20 million. Agriculture is a key sector. Rural \nhouseholds comprise 64% of the total population. Close to 10% of the total population is poor, \nand about half of 40 rural counties are classified as either national or regional poverty counties. \nGuizhou  is  a  mountainous  agricultural  province  in  the  upstream  Yangtze  River  basin  in \nsouthwestern PRC. Guizhou\u2019s total population is 38 million, of which 87% is in rural areas. It is \nthe  poorest  province  in  the  PRC  with  poverty  incidence  estimated  at  9.5%.  Low-income \nhouseholds  comprise  30%  of  the  population.  IMAR  and  Guizhou  households  that  have \nmanaged to cross the subsistence line remain vulnerable, and many have fallen back into \npoverty due to natural disasters or diseases.  \n \n9.  RCCs and microfinance pilots have been significant in IMAR and Guizhou. The RCC \nsystem is the largest financial institution in IMAR, with the most branch networks and number of \nemployees.15 With 2,142 offices covering all townships and counties in Guizhou, RCCs remain \nthe main provider of rural financial services. RCC reform has completed its first phase.16 In \nIMAR, the microfinance project implemented by the local women\u2019s association in Chifeng City is \nfunded  by  the  United  Nations  Development  Program  (UNDP).  In  Guizhou,  five  pilot  MFIs \noperate  with  small  client  groups  with  varying  degrees  of  success.  Their  successes  and \nproblems are similar to those faced by the MFIs in Chifeng: limited capital bases and no new \nsource of funds to lend, lack of access to regular training and skills improvement, insufficient \naccounting systems to deal with expansion, lack of institutional licensing, and interest rate \nlimitations.  \n \n10.  Several  factors  encourage  RCC  reform  and  microfinance  support  in  the  provinces \nconcerned: \n \n(i)  Strong government support. The IMAR and Guizhou governments have placed \nutmost importance on a successful rural finance reform program. The IMAR\u2019s \nFinancial Office has assumed the responsibility of directing and managing the \n                                                 \n13 Most RCCs operate a microcredit program similar to credit card operations, in which creditworthy farmers or \nherders are given a credit ceiling to draw from. The mission was told the default rate of the microcredit program is \nthe lowest, but RCCs operate it on a very limited scale,  \n14 Based on a study of 158 microfinance pilots, PBC concluded that (i) MFIs should be encouraged in the central and \nwestern regions, targeting the poor with income-generating capacity, and nonbanking MFIs should not be allowed \nto take deposits; (ii) modalities and loan sizes should be made more flexible, including group lending and \nguarantees; (iii) interest rate bands should be widened depending on costs and risks; (iv) tax concessions should \nbe given to MFIs; (v) MFIs can be self-regulated through an association; and (vi) optional minimum of operation for  \nMFIs should be around CNY5 million, including CNY1.5 million for operations and training, and CNY3.5 million for \nloan funds to finance operations for 4,000 low-income households. \n15  By the end of 2003, the total assets of the IMAR RCC system amounted to CNY40.5 billion while loans outstanding \nwas CNY17.4 billion. Total liabilities of the RCC system amounted to CNY39.6 billion, of which CNY25.5 billion was \nin deposits, which, in turn, accounted for 12.2% of total deposits among all financial institutions. Loans extended by \nRCCs comprised 9% of loans extended in IMAR by financial institutions and 95% of increases in agriculture loans. \nNPLs amounted to CNY7.87 billion, or 45.2% of total assets. Some 1,050 RCCs were making money with a total \nprofit of CNY73 million but 226 RCCs were making losses amounting to CNY65 million. As of 2003, total \ncumulative loss of the RCCs amounted to CNY880 million and the actual asset-liability balance of IMAR RCCs is \ncalculated at negative CNY2.4 billion. IMAR government estimates that the loss can be resolved in 5 years, \nassuming IMAR receives the mentioned special incentives from the central Government. \n16  Guizhou RCCs have about CNY20 billion in deposits and CNY18 billion in outstanding loans, of which CNY13 \nbillion is in agricultural lending. It is estimated that RCCs reach 30\u201340% of rural clients. Last year, 26% of RCCs in \nGuizhou were in the red. \n ", "4  \nRCC reform process.17 Jiangkou County in Guizhou has actively sought to be \nincluded in the model MFI program, while the Assistant Governor's Office directs \nand manages the RCC and related microfinance reform processes. The Guizhou \nprovincial government is considering allocating poverty reduction funds for this \ncause. \n(ii)  Rapid growth of nonagricultural sectors. IMAR and Guizhou have registered \nrapid economic growth in last 3\u20134 years, primarily fueled by resource-intensive \nindustries, small and medium-sized enterprises, and tourism. \n(iii)  Addressing  poverty.  The  IMAR  and  Guizhou  governments  recognize  the \nimportance of MFIs in reaching the poor and have committed to establishing a \nfocused microfinance program. \n \n11.  However, the following concerns need to be addressed:  \n \n(i)  Geographic distance and economic disparity. IMAR\u2019s large size and the long \nstretch from east to west, and Guizhou\u2019s mountainous environment with low \npopulation  density  and  poor  infrastructure,  require  heavy  administrative  and \nsupervisory costs for RCCs and MFIs. Disparity in operational conditions for \nRCCs and MFIs require flexible policies.18 \n(ii)  Limited  operational  scale,  poor  financial  performance,  and  weak \ninstitutional  capability.  Given  the  vast  areas  of  service  and  the  small \npopulation, many RCCs operate on a limited scale and perform poorly.19 Most \nRCCs have poor bookkeeping methods20 and lack qualified staff, more critically \nin Guizhou Province as reform progresses; \n(iii)  Policy constraints. RCCs are subject to many policy constraints that further \nundermine their profitability and financial safety.21 RCCs also face strong local \ngovernment  interference.22  MFIs  are  not  formally  licensed  and  cannot  take \ndeposits. \n(iv)  Poor corporate governance. RCCs and RCCUs have complicated and unclear \nownership  structures.  Original  RCC  members  such  as  farmers  and  herders \nhardly participate in key policy issues.23 RCCUs are usually established based on \n                                                 \n17 The  IMAR  Financial  Office  has  identified  RCC  reform  as  an  integral  part  of  the  overall  financial  market \ndevelopment in IMAR. The Financial Office is developing a small and medium-sized enterprise credit guarantee \nsystem, an agriculture insurance scheme, and a credit information system. \n18 For example, Manzhouli RCCU has never been operated as a traditional rural financial institution, and the best \noption is to restructure it into an urban credit cooperative or city commercial bank. Such an option, however, is not \ncovered under the policy. \n19 Most RCCs registered a very low loan-to-deposit ratio, and even lower for agriculture loans. RCCs often seek \nperceived safer investments but lack risk management capabilities. Many investments thus resulted in losses. \nRCCs barely break even despite heavy subsidies. Eight out of 13 RCCs within the Otog RCCU had less than \nCNY10 million in deposits. The capital adequacy ratio of Hohhot RCCU is only 6%. For Baotou RCCU, it is only \n4%. \n20 The rural credit cooperative unions (RCCUs) that the mission visited reported an NPL ratio of 15\u201317% and a \nrecovery ratio of 20% although the IMAR-wide estimate is above 45%. The NPL recovery ratio of ABC is only 10%. \n21  For example, the restricted interest rate structure essentially leaves no profit margin. It is estimated that an RCC \ncan break even at central bank base rate plus 37% upward float. RCCs provide loans to their members at the \ncentral bank rate plus 45% upward float, leaving an 8% upward float margin. Many local government fiscal \nagencies do not allow fiscal funds to be deposited in RCCs. \n22 The implementation strategies of the RCC reform initiatives reflect the local governments\u2019 wishes rather than a \ncarefully considered strategy reflecting wishes of RCC members and financial sustainability. \n23 Many are not even aware that they are members of the RCC. Some RCCs treat depositors as members of the \nRCC and recognize their deposits as shares without informing them. \n ", "  5\nadministrative boundaries, not on economic necessity. The Government appoints \nsenior officials at RCCUs.  \n \n12.  ADB's Operations and Strategy. The overall aim of ADB\u2019s operation in the PRC is to \npromote pro-poor economic growth. The rural sector, to which most of the poor belong, is \nimportant in poverty reduction. ADB\u2019s financial sector operations will support this strategic \nobjective by (i) helping restructure rural financial institutions and strengthening their institutional \ncapabilities;  (ii)  strengthening  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory  framework,  and \nencouraging rural financial institutions to adopt sound corporate governance standards; and (iii) \nenhancing competition and efficiency in financial services to the rural poor. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The  TA  goal  is  to  expand  sustainable  financial  services  to  the  rural  poor  in \nunderdeveloped areas of Guizhou and IMAR. The TA will (i) ensure the adoption of suitable \nRCC institutional and supervisory frameworks, resulting in institutional restructuring strategies \nfor  various  types  of  RCCs  as  well  as  appropriate  regulatory  and  supervision  systems  for \nrestructured RCCs; and (ii) develop a sound policy and institutional framework for microfinance \nand  MFIs,  resulting  in  enhanced  awareness  of  policymakers  and  the  public  about  the \nimportance and feasibility of microfinance, and development of microfinance mechanisms and \nthe licensing of institutions. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA has two components, each responsive to the particular needs of the concerned \nprovince and its unique timing of RCC reforms. Component A in IMAR will (i) assess the \nperformance of RCCs in IMAR and, after thorough consultation with all stakeholders, identify \nand  help  implement  a  comprehensive  strategy  for  RCC  policy  and  institutional  reforms  in \nIMAR;24 (ii) prepare pilot RCCs and RCCUs with commercial potential for restructuring into \nACBs or ACOBs; and (iii) establish a conducive policy framework for microfinance development. \nComponent B in Guizhou will (i) build capacity for RCC staff in Guizhou to improve loan \noperations in the post-restructuring period; (ii) develop Guizhou provincial and related county \ngovernments\u2019 understanding of and capacity for support to microfinance policy, regulatory, and \ninstitutional development; and (iii) develop and implement a competitive bidding process to \nestablish a licensed model MFI in Jiangkou and adjacent counties.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,440,000 equivalent, comprising $445,000 in \nforeign exchange and $995,000 equivalent in local currency costs. It is proposed that ADB \nfinance $1,000,000 equivalent, consisting of the entire foreign exchange costs and $555,000 \nequivalent in local costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund. The Government will contribute $440,000 equivalent in kind for office space, \n                                                 \n24  This will include restructuring, administrative framework, financial and institutional and operational strengthening, \nand a sound policy, regulatory, and supervisory and institutional framework for the healthy development of the local \nfinancial market in IMAR. The reform process will be monitored in pilot areas and best practices disseminated to \nother localities in IMAR.  \n ", "6  \ncounterpart staff, transportation, and other services. Details of the cost estimates for the TA are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The IMAR Financial Office will be the Executing Agency (EA) for component A. A \nleading group will be set up comprising top officials of IMAR, finance bureau, Financial Office \nsenior management, PBC Hohhot branch, and CBRC Hohhot Branch; and heads of RCCs and \nRCCUs. The vice governor of IMAR in charge of financial sector issues will chair the leading \ngroup. The  Guizhou  Provincial  RCC  Reform  Office  will  be  the  EA  for  component  B. The \nGuizhou provincial RCCU and selected county government offices will be the implementing \nagencies.25  \n \n17.  The  TA  will  engage  five  international  consultants  for  10  person-months  and  nine \ndomestic  consultants  for  24  person-months.26  Separate  budgets  are  provided  to  engage \nresource persons to participate in seminars and conferences and to cover specific technical \nareas. The  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  The  consultants  will  be \nselected and engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the selection and engagement of \ndomestic consultants. Equipment (notebook computers, facsimile machines, and photocopiers) \nwill be procured by the EAs in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The advance \npayment facility procedure will be adopted to facilitate timely organization of training, seminars, \nand conference activities. For both components, the consultants will submit (i) inception reports \n1  week  after  their  services  start,  (ii)  interim  progress  reports  at  appropriate  stages  of  TA \nimplementation, (iii) draft final reports before the conclusion of the contract, and (iv) final reports \n2  weeks  after  incorporating  the  EAs\u2019  and  ADB's  comments.27  Both  TA  components  will \ncommence in November 2004 and will be completed in November 2005.  \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty \nReduction Cooperation Fund for Rural Finance Reforms and Development of Microfinance \nInstitutions, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n25  The executing and implementing agencies of the two components will provide office space, counterpart staff, \ntransportation, and other services to the consultants and will arrange their appointments with relevant agencies and \norganizations \n26 The three international consultants for component A will include a rural finance restructuring specialist (4 person-\nmonths), an agriculture banking specialist (2 person-months), and a microfinance development specialist (2 \nperson-months).  The  two  international  consultants  for  component  B  will  include  a  microfinance  institution \ndevelopment specialist (1 person-month) and a microfinance licensing specialist (1 person-month). The five \ndomestic consultants for component A will include a rural finance reform strategy specialist (3 person-months), an \nagriculture banking specialist (3 person-months), a microfinance development specialist (3 person-months), an \nRCC legal and regulatory specialist (3 person-months), and an RCC accounting specialist (3 person-months). The \nfour domestic consultants for component B will include a financial institutions training specialist (2 person-months), \na microfinance applied research specialist (4 person-months), a rural credit demand analyst (2 person-months), \nand a bidding specialist (1 person-month). \n27  All reports must be submitted in English and Chinese.
