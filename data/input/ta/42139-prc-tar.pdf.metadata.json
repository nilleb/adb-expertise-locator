INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  provincial  development  strategies  for \nChongqing Municipality and Guizhou Province1 continues a series of similar projects in the \nPeople's Republic of China (PRC). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) first approved TA for a \nprovincial development strategy for Hebei Province in 2003. Encouraged by the success of that \nTA, the Government of the PRC requested that ADB develop a systematic approach to support \nprovincial reforms and development, and other provinces have submitted proposals to the PRC \nMinistry of Finance (MOF) requesting similar ADB assistance. Five TA projects have thus far \nbeen approved for eight provinces or autonomous regions, including: (i) independent projects \nfor Hebei Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; and (ii) three combined projects \ncovering  Xinjiang  Uyghur  Autonomous  Region  and  Gansu  Province,  Hunan  and  Jiangxi \nprovinces, and Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces.2\n \n2.  During the 2008 Midterm Country Program Review Mission, the Government requested \nthat ADB provide Chongqing and Guizhou with similar assistance. Chongqing and Guizhou \nwere visited by an ADB reconnaissance mission in March 2009 and a fact-finding mission in \nJune 2009. Agreement was reached with the provincial governments and MOF on the TA\u2019s \nscope,  cost  estimates,  financing  plan,  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services,  and \nimplementation arrangements. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The PRC has made considerable progress in overall economic development in the last \nthree decades, but the benefits have been unevenly distributed among regions. The western \nregion covers 12 provinces or autonomous regions or municipalities, and has benefited less \nthan the east coast from economic growth and reforms. Incomes are lower, poverty is more \nwidespread, and health and education facilities are poorer than the national average. The \nGovernment has implemented its western development strategy since 1999 in an effort to \nrebalance regional development. ADB supports the Government's strategy by allocating more \nresources to the interior provinces, including loans and TA. The outputs of the previous TA \nprojects  for  provincial  development  strategies  were  highly  appreciated  by  the  central  and \nrelevant provincial governments. Many policy recommendations and innovative ideas proposed \nunder these TA projects have been reflected in government policy documents. The Government \nstrongly supports continued provision by ADB of such TA. \n \n4.  Chongqing and Guizhou are located in the southwestern region, and each has a large \nrural population. Chongqing was established as the PRC's fourth provincial-level municipality in \n1997, and has subsequently experienced robust economic growth. It remains poor, however; in \n                                                 \n1 During the 2008 Country Programming Mission, held in Manila on 10\u201312 December 2008, Guizhou Province was \nadded to the TA at the request of the Government. Accordingly, the TA's title was changed from Strategy for \nChongqing Development to Provincial Development Strategies for Chongqing Municipality and Guizhou Province, \nand the grant amount increased from $500,000 to $800,000. \n2 ADB. 2002.

", "                                                 2\n2008 it ranked 19th of 31 provincial-level units in terms of per capita gross domestic product \n(GDP). Chongqing was recently selected as the only provincial-level unit to pilot the urban\u2013rural \nunification strategy, and it was felt that this pilot would benefit from external assistance. Guizhou \nis the nation's poorest province, with an average per capita GDP of CNY8,284 ($1,298) in 2008, \nor about one third of the national average of $3,266. Both Chongqing and Guizhou are home to \nmany poor people. Supporting Chongqing and Guizhou in planning their development strategies \nwill contribute to the PRC's poverty reduction, urban\u2013rural unification, western development, \nand sustainable development strategies. \n \nA.  Chongqing \n \n5.  Chongqing  is  the  most  populous  provincial-level  municipality  in  the  PRC,  with  a \npopulation of 31 million\u2014the other provincial-level municipalities are Shanghai (16.4 million), \nBeijing (13.2 million), and Tianjin (10 million). Chongqing is also the poorest of the municipalities. \nThere are 1.42 million people in Chongqing living below the national poverty line, accounting for \nmore than 5.9% of the municipality's rural population.4 Fourteen of the 40 counties under \nChongqing's jurisdiction are classified as national poverty counties.5   \n \n6.  Chongqing is the newest and largest municipality in the PRC, covering 82,400 square \nkilometers. Prior to its establishment as a provincial-level municipality in 1997, Chongqing was a \ncity in Sichuan Province. Chongqing consists of three distinct parts, the downtown area, the \ncounties originally under Chongqing city (a prefecture-level administrative unit), and the poor \nmountainous counties that were reallocated from Sichuan Province to Chongqing in 1997. While \nthe Chongqing government has attempted to integrate these three parts into a single municipal \nsystem, its efforts have not been entirely successful. A systematic and consistent development \nstrategy is needed to help the municipality attain its goal of urban\u2013rural integration.  \n \n7.   After reviewing the previous development strategies and analyzing the various issues \nfacing the municipality, the Chongqing government identified the following key constraints to the \nintegration  and  development  of  Chongqing:  transport,  the  living  environment,  security, \nenvironmental protection, and public health. The Chongqing government announced its intent to \nconstruct \"five Chongqings\", 6 and committed to address the major constraints in these five \nareas through Chongqing's 12th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2011\u20142015).  \n \n8.  To facilitate Chongqing's integration and socioeconomic development, the Government \nis encouraging the municipality to adopt an innovative approach to unifying its urban\u2013rural areas. \nThe  State  Council  issued  a  special  policy  document  to  guide  Chongqing's  urban\u2013rural \nunification in January 2009. The policy document endorsed the Chongqing government's efforts \nin the five key areas, and MOF requested that ADB provide TA to help Chongqing formulate a \nstrategic framework and provide specific policy recommendations regarding the five areas.  \n                                                 \n4 The Government\u2019s national rural poverty line is set at an annual income of CNY1196 (about $176); there is no \nunified national urban poverty line. Rural residents with annual incomes equal to or below CNY1196 are considered \npoor and entitled to government allowances. The PRC had an estimated 40 million poor people in 2008. \n5 The Government targets its poverty reduction programs at \u201cnational poverty counties\u201d, which have relatively high \nnumbers of rural poor. Provincial governments also designate \u201cprovincial poverty counties\u201d. \n6 \"Five Chongqings\" consists of five key emphasis areas: (i) \u201clivable Chongqing\u201d, comprising a friendly environment, \ndecent dwellings, well developed communities, and sufficient living facilities; (ii) \u201csmooth transport Chongqing\u201d, \ncomprising adequate roads, smooth mass transport, and convenient transportation; (iii) \u201cforested Chongqing\u201d, \ncomprising  provision  of  good  air  quality  and  plentiful  grass  and/or  forested  land;  (iv)  \u201cpeaceful  Chongqing\u201d, \ncomprising safety, security, and a low crime rate; and (v) \u201chealthy Chongqing\u201d, comprising good public health facilities, \naffordable medical charges, and sufficient sports and recreation facilities.   \n   ", "3           \n \nB.   Guizhou \n \n9.  Guizhou has a population of 37.93 million. More than 20% of Guizhou's total rural \npopulation lives below the national poverty line; these 5.85 million people account for 14% of the \ntotal  poor  population  nationwide.  Fifty  of  Guizhou\u2019s  88  counties  are  classified  as  national \npoverty counties. Guizhou was less than one third (29.1%) urbanized in 2008, the lowest \nproportion in the PRC, and many of its inhabitants are poor rural residents. Lessons derived \nfrom the development of the PRC\u2019s coastal region have led the province to promote green \nurbanization,  with  low  carbon  emissions  and  lower  levels  of  industrial  pollution.  Green \nurbanization will benefit Guizhou\u2019s inhabitants while helping to reduce global climate change.  \n \n10.  Guizhou is a mountainous inland province covering 176,100 square kilometers, 92.5% of \nwhich comprises mountains and foothills, with only 7.5% arable land. Guizhou features karst \ntopography, and is composed largely (61.9%) of exposed limestone. Stony desertification is \nwidespread\u201421.4% of Guizhou is currently stony desert, and another 19.3% is in the process of \nturning  into  stony  desert7\u2014and  constitutes  a  major  constraint  on  Guizhou's  development. \nRehabilitating the existing stony desert and preventing further stony desertification are essential \nelements of Guizhou's development.    \n \n11.  Guizhou\u2019s special geographical conditions, unique ecosystem, and benign climate make \nit  an  ideal  place  for  producing  environmentally-friendly  agricultural  products.  However,  the \nprovince's  agricultural  producers  have  limited  access  to  larger  outside  markets  and  are \nconstrained in terms of value-adding as a result of a lack of technology, shortage of agricultural \nengineers  and  skilled  workers,  inadequate  capital,  underdeveloped  transport,  inappropriate \nagribusiness models, and insufficient marketing. To help the rural poor and accelerate rural \ndevelopment, the provincial government hopes that the proposed ADB TA will help formulate a \nfood development strategy that focuses on processing of hazard-free, green, and organic food.8  \n \n12.  Optimizing and upgrading the industrial sector and accelerating industrialization are vital \nto Guizhou's overall development. However, Guizhou's industries are constrained by low-end \nproduction,  short  production  chains,  outdated  technology,  and  insufficient  innovation,  and \nconcentrate on resource exploration and extraction and the manufacturing of unrefined products, \nwith limited value-added. Secondary industry accounted for 42.3% of Guizhou's GDP in 2008, \nthe second lowest in the PRC. There is a consensus among various stakeholders in Guizhou \nthat the current unsatisfactory economic development pattern must be changed. Additional \nsteps should be taken to promote recycling, enhance energy efficiency, extend the industrial \nchain,  and accelerate  innovation  if  economic development  is  to  be  increased  and  poverty \nreduced.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA comprises a Chongqing component and a Guizhou component, and aims to help \ndevelop balanced and sustainable socioeconomic development strategies for the PRC's poorest \nmunicipality (Chongqing) and poorest province (Guizhou). The expected impact of the proposed \n                                                 \n7 Stony desertification is the degradation of land in limestone areas resulting primarily from human activities and the \nresultant failure of ecological succession.  \n8 PRC food safety and quality standards include hazard-free (the basic standard of food safety), green food (a higher \nstandard), and organic food (the highest quality standard).      \n ", "                                                 4\nTA  will  be  unified  development  supported  by  related  physical  and  social  infrastructure  in \nChongqing and more balanced development in Guizhou. The expected outcome of the TA is the \nadoption by relevant government agencies of policy reforms, regulations, and new ideas and \npractices to be introduced or recommended under the TA.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n1.  Chongqing Component  \n14.   The  Chongqing  component  will  produce  a  strategic  report  on  promoting  social \ninvestments in the construction of \"five Chongqings\" under the framework for unifying urban\u2013\nrural development. This report will comprise a comprehensive report and five subproject reports \non the key emphasis areas\u2014e.g., livability, transport, the environment, safety and security, and \nhealth (footnote 6). The findings, conclusions, and policy recommendations will be submitted to \nthe government in the form of policy briefs, report summaries, and final reports. The outputs of \nthe Chongqing component will serve as inputs to the municipality's 12th FYP. The Chongqing \ncomponent will also include consultative workshops and a dissemination conference. \n \n15.   The Chongqing component will address key constraints by reviewing ways to mobilize \nmore private investments. This component will (i) diagnose the constraints to development in \nthe five emphasis areas; (ii) rank the constraints in the order of importance and identify those \nthat most urgently need to be addressed; (iii) prepare a strategy for development based on an \nanalysis of the key constraints, favorable conditions, and their interrelationships; (iv) estimate \nthe costs and resources needed to promote the \"five Chongqings\" against the background of \nunifying urban\u2013rural development; (v) draw from experiences and lessons from international \nbest practices; and (vi) provide policy recommendations on how to attract private investment to \npromote the \"five Chongqings.\" \n \n2.  Guizhou Component \n \n16.   The Guizhou component will produce a comprehensive report on changing Guizhou's \neconomic development pattern, and will be supported by four sub-reports on: (i) accelerating \nindustrialization  in  Guizhou;  (ii)  approaches  to  and  policy  reforms  for  accelerating  green \nurbanization in Guizhou; (iii) more rapid development of hazard-free, green and organic food (as \ndefined in footnote 8); and (iv) approaches to and policy measures for preventing and managing \nstony desertification. The findings, conclusions, and policy recommendations will be submitted \nto the government in the form of policy briefs, a summary report, and final reports. The outputs \nof  the  Guizhou  component  will  serve  as  inputs  to  the  province's  12th  FYP.  The  Guizhou \ncomponent will also include consultative workshops, a dissemination conference, and technical \ntraining. \n \n17.   The  Guizhou  component  will  focus  on  optimizing  provincial  economic  development \npatterns through effective use of natural resources. This component will (i) conduct a thorough \ndiagnosis  of  constraints  to  urbanization,  industrialization,  food  development,  and  stony \ndesertification management; (ii) rank the constraints in terms of importance and identify the \nmost urgent constraints; (iii) develop a development strategy based on an analysis of the key \nconstraints, favorable conditions, and their interrelationships; (iv) draw from experiences and \nlessons from international best practices; and (v) provide policy recommendations to promote \nchanges in Guizhou's economic development pattern. \n \n   ", "5           \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The  estimated  cost  of  the  TA  is  $1,000,000  equivalent,  of  which  $800,000  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program (Technical Assistance Special Fund-\nothers); half of that amount will be allocated to Chongqing, and half to Guizhou. Contributions by \nthe Chongqing and Guizhou governments, estimated at $100,000 equivalent each for a total of \n$200,000 equivalent, will cover remuneration of counterpart staff, office facilities, administrative \nsupport, and logistics. Appendix 2 details cost estimates and the financing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The executing agency (EA) for Chongqing will be the Chongqing Municipal Finance \nBureau, and the EA for Guizhou will be the Guizhou Provincial Finance Department. The \nChongqing Municipal Finance Bureau and the Guizhou Provincial Finance Department will \ncoordinate  with  provincial  agencies  to  carry  out,  monitor,  and  evaluate  the  respective  TA \ncomponents.  Each  province  will  establish  a  steering  committee  and  a  project  office.  The \nsteering committee will be chaired by a Vice Mayor or Vice Governor and include members from \nthe Municipal or Provincial Development and Reform Commission, Agricultural Department, \ngovernment think tanks, and other relevant government agencies. The project office will provide \noffice space with telecommunications access, counterpart staff, information, basic data, and \nlogistical support needed by the consultants. The project office will appoint a provincial project \ncoordinator who will liaise and coordinate with Chongqing and Guizhou stakeholders, ADB, and \nthe consultants. \n20.  The TA project will be implemented over 18 months, from October 2009 to March 2011. \nAll procurement will follow ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nAll procured equipment will be handed over to the EAs at the completion of the TA project. A \nconsulting firm will be selected and engaged by ADB for each component using quality- and \ncost-based selection, and an 80/20 quality/cost ratio.9 A simplified technical proposal will be \nrequired.  The  consulting  firms  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The TA requires \n77 person-months of international and national consultants and about 180 days of resource \nperson  services.  The  Chongqing  component  will  require  a  total  of  37  person-months  of \nconsulting  services,  including  3  person-months  of  international  consultant  services  and  34 \nperson-months of national consultant services. The Guizhou component will require a total of 40 \nperson-months of consultant services, including 3 person-months of international consultant \nservices  and  37  person-months  of  national  consultant  services.  The  consultants\u2019  terms  of \nreference are in Appendix 3. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line with the ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.10\n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Provincial Development Strategies \nfor Chongqing Municipality and Guizhou Province, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                 \n9 Quality- and cost-based selection considers both the quality of the technical proposals and costs in the financial \nproposals. The technical proposals will be given a weight of 80% and the costs a weight of 20%, which is a standard \napproach for quality- and cost-based selection. ADB. 2009. Recruiting Consulting Firms.
