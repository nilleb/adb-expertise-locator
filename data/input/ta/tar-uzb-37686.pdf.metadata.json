During the country programming mission in May 2004, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) and the Government of Uzbekistan agreed to include a technical assistance (TA) for a \nfinancial sector infrastructure development in the 2004 program. A fact-finding mission1 visited \nUzbekistan 28 June\u20132 July 2004 to discuss with relevant government agencies the objectives, \nscope, cost, financing, and implementation arrangements for the TA. Appendix 1 gives the TA \nframework.2\n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Uzbekistan\u2019s  financial  sector  has  transformed  significantly  since  its  transition  to  a \nmarket-based economy began in 1992\u20131994. Measures were taken to gradually (i) shift the \nbanking system inherited from the former Soviet Union to market orientation, (ii) establish \ncapital markets, and (iii) develop nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs). As a result, the basic \nlegal, regulatory, and institutional framework for a financial sector operating on market principles \nhas been established. Parts of the legislation and regulation are already in line with international \nstandards. There is also a well-organized and efficient payment system, modern management \ninformation systems (MIS) in leading banks, and a technically sophisticated trading platform for \nsecurities. \n \n3.  Despite  significant  progress  in  financial  sector  reforms,  the  level  of  financial \nintermediation is still low. The ratio of broad money to gross domestic product (GDP) fell from \n17% in 1997 to about 10% in 2003. The deposit rate remains low because, among other things, \npublic confidence in banks has been weak. Because domestic resources are not fully mobilized, \ncommercial banks must rely heavily on borrowing from abroad to meet financial needs of \ndomestic enterprises.3\n \n4.  The banking sector appears highly concentrated and segmented. Of the 32 commercial \nbanks, only one, the National Bank of Uzbekistan (NBU) accounts for about two-thirds of total \nassets and capital. The two largest banks, NBU and Asaka Bank, as well as the Halyk Savings \nBank, are fully (or almost fully) state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs). The Government has \nannounced a plan to sell 49% of NBU shares and 50% of Asaka Bank shares to foreign \nstrategic investors. This plan has not yet been fully implemented. Twelve commercial banks are \nregistered as joint stock companies (JSCs), known as joint stock company banks (JSCBs). The \nremaining 12 private banks4 and five banks with foreign capital are small niche players. In 2003, \nthe  Government  sold  most  of  its  minority  shares  (less  than  25%)  in  the  JSCBs.  But  the \nGovernment still has indirect shareholdings in nine JSCBs through state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs), SOCBs, and state-controlled production and trade associations. Furthermore, as a \nlegacy of the Soviet system of specialized banks, many banks continue to concentrate mainly in \na few industries or economic sectors. This sector focus also applies to private banks, which also \nhave a narrow regional outreach. \n \n                                                 \n1  The mission comprised Masashi Tanabe, banking specialist, Governance, Finance and Trade Division (ECGF) of \nthe East and Central Asia Department. The mission was supported by Jurgen Conrad, ECGF, and Abbas Ofarinov \nof ADB\u2019s resident mission in Uzbekistan. \n2  The TA was first listed in the ADB Business Opportunities on 12 July 2004. \n3  In the case of the National Bank of Uzbekistan, 60% of total liability was foreign credit, and the lending-to-deposit \nratio was more than 200% at the end of 2002. \n4  A private bank is defined as one in which individuals own 50% or more of its shares. \n ", "2  \n5.  Uzbekistan  commercial  banks  support  tax  authorities  in  collecting  tax  arrears  by \nmonitoring and reporting financial transactions and account information through the Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF).  Firms  are  requested  to  conduct  all  financial  transactions  through  bank \naccounts. All of these measures are costly for commercial banks, and are disincentives for \nenterprises and the population to deposit money in banks. This explains, to some degree, the \nlow level of bank deposits. Acknowledging the issue, the Government plans to free banks from \ntax collection support with support from the World Bank as part of a project aimed at developing \na treasury. \n \n6.  Another important characteristic of Uzbekistan banks is that they perform potentially \nconflicting roles in supporting the Government\u2019s industrial policies, and in seeking profits as \ncommercial entities. Until recently, the Government directed banks to extend loans to particular \nenterprises or industries, and provided guarantees for a large part of bank loans.5 But since \n2002, the Government has formally refrained from direct intervention in lending decisions of \nbanks. State guarantees for new loans are now given to only a few \u201cstrategically important \nprojects\u201d in areas like the oil and gas sector, education, and health care.6 The stock of loans \ncovered by state guarantees, however, is still very high, about 50% of the credit portfolio of the \nbanking system. Some JSCBs also support state policies such as financing cotton farmers with \nstate funds. \n \n7.  Although  Uzbekistan  banks  have  high  capital  adequacy  ratios  and  relatively  low \nnonperforming loan ratios, the combination of foreign borrowing as the basis for domestic \nlending poses significant risks. The commercial banks usually try to transfer the exchange rate \nrisk to their borrowers by providing foreign currency-indexed loans in local currency. But many \nborrowers  of  such  loans  do  not  have  much  foreign  currency  cash  flow.  Consequently,  a \ndevaluation of the local currency would negatively influence their capability to service such \nloans. Simultaneous financial difficulties for a large number of borrowers would also bring \ndifficulties for the respective banks. Some banks, aware of the risks, have started to build loan \nloss provisions for foreign currency-indexed loans, including those with government guarantees. \n \n8.  Capital markets and NBFIs do not yet play a significant role in financial intermediation, \nalthough their growth is relatively rapid. The turnover of corporate stocks and bonds on the \nprimary and secondary market was SUM75 billion ($86 million) in 2003\u2014equivalent to only \n0.9% of GDP. Of 1,700 large and medium-sized JSCs, shares of 800\u2013900 companies are \ntraded in the Uzbekistan Stock Exchange. But only six enterprises are listed. Corporate bonds \nhave been issued 10 times since 2002, but they totaled only $6 million equivalent. The market \nfor government securities is also small. The outstanding volume of treasury bills was $55 million \nequivalent in 2002. \n \n9.  Seventeen credit unions serve about 10,000 members, with total outstanding loans of \nSUM1.7 billion. Microfinance institutions have similar volumes of business as credit unions; 12 \ninstitutions serve about 10,000 clients. The total insurance premium is equivalent to about 0.3% \nof GDP. The degree of sector concentration is high, with each company specializing in a \nparticular area such as foreign trade, agriculture, or small businesses. Four fully or partly state-\nowned companies dominate the market with 76% of insurance premiums. Property insurance is \nthe leading type of insurance (84% of premiums), while life insurance is insignificant (less than \n                                                 \n5   At the end of 2002, the Government guaranteed 73% of the bank loans. \n6  More than 80% of the NBU loans were covered by the government guarantees until 2002, but government \nguarantees covered only 10\u201315% of the new loans in 2003 and the first half of 2004. ", "  3\n1% of premiums). Leasing is a relatively large sector compared with other NBFIs, with leasing \ncompanies writing SUM45.6 billion in 2002.  \n \n10.  The  Central  Bank  of  Uzbekistan  (CBU)  is  responsible  for  monetary  policy  and  for \nsupervising banks and credit unions. MOF is responsible for supervising insurance companies. \nThe Center for Coordination and Control of Functioning of the Securities Market (CCFSM), \nunder the State Property Committee, supervises capital markets, including equity and corporate \nbond markets. MOF supervises the market for government securities and CBU, the foreign \ncurrency market. Leasing is governed by the civil code and is not a licensed activity. Leasing \ncompanies are registered with MOF. The supervising authority for microfinance institutions has \nnot yet been determined. The coordination between these different government departments is \nkey for successful reform of the financial sector. \n \n11.  Several of Uzbekistan\u2019s development partners have supported development and reforms \nin the financial sector through various projects. The World Bank\u2019s Financial Institutional Building \nProject  provided  (i)  TA  to  banks  to  improve  risk  management,  strategic  planning,  MIS, \naccounting, and audits; (ii) TA to CBU to strengthen legal and regulatory frameworks; and               \n(iii) information technology support for MIS in banks and for payment systems. The European \nBank for Reconstruction and Development provided several credit lines for small or medium \nenterprises (SMEs). The International Finance Corporation (IFC) also provided several loans \nand credit lines to support SMEs and microfinance borrowers through commercial banks and \nleasing companies. The United States Agency for International Development helped strengthen \nmicrofinance institutions, supported the network of credit unions, and helped CBU introduce \ninternational  accounting  standards  and  banking  supervision  best  practices.  ADB  has  also \nplayed an important role in supporting the Uzbekistan financial sector and provided (i) two SME \ncredit lines, (ii) TA to strengthen capacities in SOCBs involved in the credit lines, and (iii) TA to \nstrengthen  regulation  and  supervision  of  insurance  companies.  To  complement  these \ninterventions, ADB has approved a small and microfinance development loan and a TA to \nstrengthen capital market regulations. \n \n12.  Although  ADB  has  provided  several  loans  and  TAs  to  support  development  of  the \nUzbekistan financial sector, ADB has done few diagnostic works in the area. Other Uzbekistan \ndevelopment  partners  have  recently  produced  several  studies,  but  they  focus  on  specific \nfinancial sector areas.7 Therefore, agreement was reached to undertake a more comprehensive \ndiagnosis of the entire financial sector to better understand remaining constraints to sector \ndevelopment, complement ongoing activities, and identify areas for future intervention. \n \n13.  Because the TA for development of the capital market,8 approved in July 2003, includes \na diagnostic study of capital markets, the proposed TA will cover the banking sector and the \nNBFI sector which is not covered by  the capital market TA. \n \n14.  ADB\u2019s Operation and Strategy. ADB has supported development and reform in the \nfinancial sector through several loans and TAs. The Uzbekistan Country Strategy and Program \nfocuses  on  strengthening  the  banking  sector  and  banking  skills,  improving  supervisory \ncapacities, and deregulation toward market-based finance and governance. \n \n                                                 \n7  IFC has published reports on SME financing, microfinance, and leasing activities. The Article IV Consultation of the \nInternational Monitory Fund includes, as a selected issue,  a study on the banking sector. \n8   ADB. 2003.

Purpose and Output \n15.  The goal of this advisory TA is to promote development of the financial sector to facilitate \nallocation of domestic resources to productive sectors. The purpose of the TA is to recommend \na comprehensive strategy for development of the financial sector. The outputs of the TA will be \n(i)  a  diagnostic  study  of  the  banking  sector  that  identifies,  and  recommends  measures  to \naddress constraints to development of the sector; and (ii) a diagnostic study of the NBFI sector \nthat identifies, and recommends measures to address constraints to development of the sector. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n16.  The TA scope includes: \n(i)  a  diagnostic  study  of  the  banking  sector,  with  recommended  measures  to \naddress constraints to sector development, focusing specifically on \n(a)  financial intermediation, resource mobilization, and allocation; \n(b)  government policies with respect to banks; \n(c)  market structure and competition; \n(d)  operation and corporate governance of banks; \n(e)  financial soundness of banks, including resilience against various risks; \n(f)  legislation, regulations, and supervision, including disclosure standards \nand accounting and audit requirements; \n(g)  remedial measures and bank insolvency rules; and \n(h)  creditors\u2019 rights. \n(ii)  a diagnostic study of the NBFIs, including credit unions, microfinance institutions, \nand insurance and leasing companies, with recommended measures to address \nconstraints to the sector\u2019s development; and \n(iii)  based on the recommendations under (i) and (ii), and the study through the TA \nfor development of the capital market, propose a comprehensive financial sector \ndevelopment  strategy  focusing  on  key  areas  requiring  skills \ndevelopment/capacity enhancement and means\u2014using ADB\u2019s lending modalities \nand/or TAs\u2014to support strategy implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $550,000 equivalent, of which $305,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $245,000 equivalent is the local currency cost.  The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$95,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the \nbalance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $150,000, through the provision of counterpart \nstaff, office space and contingencies. See Appendix 2 for details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Ministry of Finance of Uzbekistan will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA. The \nEA is expected to provide the necessary office space, counterpart staff, transportation, and \nother services for the consultants; and arrange their appointments with relevant organizations. \nThe EA will coordinate with financial sector regulators, including CBU and CCFSM, to provide ", "  5\nnecessary data and information to the consultants, and to support the consultants in arranging \nworkshops and training programs for the regulators. \n \n19.  The  TA  will  require  22  person-months  of  consultant  services:  4  international,  for  7 \nperson-months, and 5 domestic, for 15 person-months. The international consultants will include \na banking sector specialist-team leader, an insurance sector specialist, a microfinance sector \nspecialist, and a specialist in financial market design. Domestic consultants will have the same \nexpertise.  Appendix  3  outlines  the  terms  of  reference  for  consultants.  Consultants  will  be \nrecruited through their firms, and selected under the quality- and cost-based selection method \nusing the simplified technical proposal in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  on  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants.   \n \n20.  The consultants will submit (i) an inception report within 3 weeks after beginning their \nservices, (ii) an interim report within 3 months after start of their services, (iii) draft final reports \nbefore conclusion of the contract, and (iv) final reports after incorporating the EA\u2019s and ADB's \ncomments. All reports must be submitted in both English and Russian. The TA will begin in April \n2005 and will be completed in December 2005. Workshops will be organized near the end of the \nimplementation  period  to  invite  comments  from  international  and  domestic  experts,  and \ndisseminate project findings. The TA will also support training programs for staff of CBU and \nother regulatory bodies in skills that regulators need, including supervision for credit unions; and \nreporting, disclosure, accounting, and auditing requirements for banks and NBFIs. Consultants \nwill arrange the training programs in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.

Outputs \n1.  The  consultants  are  required  to  submit  reports  on  financial  sector  infrastructure \ndevelopment as the Project\u2019s final output. The consultants will conduct a diagnostic study of \nthe financial sector by (i) looking into the existing background documentations such as reports \nby international financial institutions (IFIs) and findings of completed and ongoing Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) projects; (ii) sending questionnaires to the Ministry of Finance \n(MOF),  Uzbekistan  Banking  Association,  Central  Bank  of  Uzbekistan  (CBU),  financial \ninstitutions, and relevant government departments; (iii) interviewing staff of these institutions \nand  other  relevant  parties;  and  (iv)  gathering  disclosed  materials  from  each  financial \ninstitution and summarizing the figures. Before submitting the final reports, the consultants \nwill submit (i) an inception report, within 3 weeks after commencement of their services, that \nincludes initial findings and approaches; (ii) an interim report, within 3 months after the \ncommencement of their services, that identifies interim findings; and  (iii) draft final reports in \nthe form of the final outputs, well in advance of conclusion of the contract. \n \n2.  The reports will provide a well-substantiated review of the following issues and identify \npotential vulnerabilities of the sector and constraints to the development of the sector. The \nanalysis should be quantitative in nature and, to the extent possible, backed by theoretical \nand/or empirical evidence. The reports will also provide recommendations on measures to \naddress the vulnerabilities and constraints identified. The measures are classified according \nto  policies,  institutions,  systems  and  procedures.  An  appendix  with  a  matrix  of  those \nmeasures  will  be  included  in  the  reports.  The  full  version  of  the  reports  will  be  kept \nconfidential  among  limited  parties  while  a  summarized  version  of  the  report  excluding \nconfidential information will be prepared for wider dissemination of the findings. \n   \n1.  Diagnostic Review of the Banking Sector \n3.  The diagnostic study of the banking sector will provide a well-substantiated review of \nthe main issues, identify vulnerabilities and constraints, and recommend measures to address \nthose vulnerabilities and constraints. The study on banks\u2019 operations and performance will \nanalyze the situations at three levels: (i) the entire banking sector; (ii) banks by categories, \ni.e., state-owned, joint stock with state shares, joint stock without state shares, private, or \nforeign; and (iii) each major bank.
