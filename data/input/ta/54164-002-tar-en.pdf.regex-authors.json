The proposed technical assistance (TA) of $1,000,000 from the Urban Climate Change \nResilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF) will help support the green building ecosystem in the affordable \nhousing sector in India. The TA will be executed by ADB, as implemented in coordination with \nIIFL Home Finance Limited (IIFLHF), an affordable housing finance company (HFC) which has \ntaken a leadership role in advancing the green affordable housing1 ecosystem in India. Despite \nthe fact that residential properties comprise more than 90% of India\u2019s building footprint, few are \ngreen certified and/or climate resilient.2 The proposed TA will help overcome some of the key \nidentified obstacles to building the ecosystem for green certified resilient and affordable housing \nin India, including (i) lack of homebuyer awareness which focuses on the higher construction cost \nrather than the long-term operational cost savings of green buildings, and (ii) lack of housing \ndeveloper experience and knowledge to develop green and climate resilient buildings. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  Need for green housing: Changing climate patterns and global warming coupled with \nincreasing urban populations, rising pollution,  deteriorated air quality,  water shortages and \ndepleting natural resources have compelled some governments and other stakeholders to take \nsteps to address these issues in their urban planning. Construction of green certified residential \nbuildings and office spaces is one such critical area which can make a significant positive impact \non the environment. The 2019 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction3 shows that \nCO2 emissions from the world\u2019s buildings and their construction remain stubbornly at about 39% \nof total carbon dioxide emissions.  Infrastructure and activities, such as transportation associated \nwith construction of buildings, add to the emissions. Further reports4 estimate that the building \nsector consumes approximately 25% of water, 35-40% of energy, and emits 40% of global waste. \n \nConversely,  important  climate  adaptation  benefits  can  result  from  an  increase  of  green \nconstruction in the affordable housing segment.  The design methods associated with certified \ngreen  buildings  result  in  less  emissions,  reduced  landfill  waste,  promotion  of  alternative \ntransportation linkages, and increased vegetated land areas to absorb CO2. The promotion of \ngreen building standards can also help ensure optimal use of natural resources, and reduction of \nwaste and pollution, thus contributing to national goals set under the Paris Climate Agreements. \nIn addition to climate benefits, green buildings also offer financial benefits to buyers such as \nenergy and water savings, lower operating and maintenance costs, and reduced health costs due \nto lower pollution and emissions. \n \n3.  Climate Adaptation in India: India is the fifth most vulnerable country to climate change,5 \nwith the rank worsening from the 14th spot in 2017. Most parts of India are expected to be \n \n1  Affordable housing is defined by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) covering segments ranging from \u201cEconomically \nWeaker Section\u201d (EWS) with family income up to 0.3 million INR per annum, \u201cLow Income Group\u201d (LIG), with income \nbetween 0.3 million-0.6 million INR, and the \u201cMiddle Income Group\u201d (MIG), with income up to 1.8 million INR per \nannum. Reserve Bank of India. RBI Bulletin. \n2  As per ANAROCK group, only 5% of buildings in India are green certified. According to International Finance \nCorporation\u2019s (IFC) Green Buildings Market Intelligence, only 2% of green buildings in India are residential. IFC. \n2018.

Low-income populations in India are particularly vulnerable given the high exposure \nof their livelihoods and homes to climate hazards, yet limited resources to protect against climate \nshocks. All of these factors contribute to the urgent need for low-regret7 adaptations to climate \nchange that will deliver benefits to vulnerable groups in the face of rising climate risks.  \n \n4.  Housing in India: There is a shortage of housing units in India, estimated at 18.78 million \nin urban areas and 43.7 million9 in rural areas. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Poverty \nAlleviation estimated more than 90% of the housing deficit to be in the affordable housing \nsegment, primarily for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and Low Income Group (LIG)10, \nleaving a substantial gap between demand and supply. At the same time, the ecosystem for green \naffordable housing is nascent, and the climate risk impact of meeting this vast housing deficit in \nthe EWS and LIG segments can be substantial if adequate attention is not given to construction \nin a climate sustainable way. Given the significant demand for affordable housing, and the fact \nthat more than 70% of the buildings needed by 2030 are yet to be constructed to meet the deficit, \nsome state governments are beginning to provide tax incentives for developers to incorporate \ngreen features in their construction.11 \n \n5.  Despite  low  baselines  in  terms  of  consumer  adoption  of  green  construction  in  the \nresidential sector, India is one of the leading countries in terms of its initiatives on commercial \ngreen buildings and ranks only second to the USA in terms of the number of green technology \nprojects  and  built-up  area.12 As  of  September  2017,  more  than  4,300  projects  covering \napproximately 4.7 billion square feet have registered for green technology. This constitutes \naround 5% of the total buildings in India; however, this is estimated to more than double and reach \naround 10 million square feet by 2022, with a value of $35- $50 billion.   \n \n6.  One of the main challenges towards adoption of green housing is lack of awareness \namong home buyers.13 Most buyers simply perceive that green buildings are expensive and are \nfinancially not feasible as they focus on the higher construction cost (up to +12%) and are not \naware of the long-term operational cost savings (up to -35%). Secondly, housing developers lack \nthe experience and knowledge to develop green buildings. Thirdly, higher costs of equipment and \nproducts used in green construction deter developers, particularly the smaller ones and in the \naffordable segment. Lack of adequate incentives and additional compliance associated with green \ncertification also deter developers. Finally, there is a dearth of adequately trained green building \nprofessionals such as architects, engineers, contractors, policy makers and workers who possess \nthe skills required for green construction, particularly in the affordable housing segment. There is \ntherefore a strong need to address the significant knowledge gap and incentive structure that \n \n6  Climate Links, USAID. 2017.

Within the already challenging market for green buildings, women have been under-\nrepresented in infrastructure planning processes and have had little control over city resources or \nto make them work to their advantage. Housing design with facilities for water and toilets, and \nwith better linkages to markets, schools, childcare, health and transport services, can all increase \nwomen\u2019s abilities to be more productive and participative.14 Gender-responsive urban planning \ncan contribute to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment in significant ways through the \nprovision of (i) accessible and affordable infrastructure and services for water supply and \nsanitation, waste disposal, electricity, transport, and housing; (ii) clean environment and better \nhealth;  and  (iii)  safety  and  security.15 This  TA  will  incorporate  best  practices  on  gender \nmainstreaming in green housing and develop appropriate guidelines for the industry, as a \nmeasure to seek to address structural biases against women. \n \n8.  As a partner for TA implementation, IIFLHF has created cross sector initiatives such as \n\u201cKutumb\u201d16, a dialogue platform to bring together industry experts, housing developers and other \nkey stakeholders to generate a larger scale and more sustainable commitment to the expanded \nsupply of green housing, through increased awareness building, policy dialogue and technical \ncapacity building for actors contributing to the supply of green housing stock in India. The larger \nobjective  of  the  TA  is  to  drive  increased  adoption  of  green  and  climate  resilient  building \ntechnologies by developers and align them to the needs of the home buyer in the affordable \nsegment. The company has conducted six Kutumb events so far, each event educating an \naverage of 100 developers on the benefits of green certified housing construction. IIFLHF has \nalso established a 'Green Value Partner' (GVP) program wherein it partners with developers to \nprovide specific technical expertise throughout the project lifecycle and certification process, \nthrough its dedicated team of technical experts, certified by one of the green certification agencies \nsuch as GRIHA or IGBC.17 IIFLHF seeks to further enhance its capacity to bridge existing \nknowledge gaps regarding green construction methods for affordable housing and to improve the \nsupply of and demand for green affordable housing through the range of proposed TA activities.  \n \n9.  The largest share of the TA funding will be dedicated to ecosystem building activities that \nbenefit the Indian housing finance industry at large. These include activities such as certification \nof housing developers in 'green' building standards (IGBC and GRIHA), capacity building support \nfor local and state housing boards to develop an incentive structure for green affordable housing, \nknowledge events to convene and build awareness with key stakeholders core to scaling the \nsupply of and demand for green affordable housing, as well as providing incentives for firms to \ninnovate in the development of new climate risk mitigation and adaptation technologies for green \nbuilding methods.  Additional outputs include collaboration with national/ international centers of \nexcellence to develop a publication on technology innovations in climate resilient housing, and on \ngreen  affordable  housing  certification  standards  to  build  awareness.  These  activities  are \nsupported with counterparty resources from IIFLHF and are expected to become a systemic part \nof IIFLHF\u2019s strategy with its own funding past the implementation period of the TA.  \n   \n \n14 UNDP India. 2009.

Outputs and Activities \n \n10.  With the support of the TA resources and ADB\u2019s knowledge inputs from expertise in urban \ndevelopment  and  affordable  housing,  IIFLHF  aims  to  play  a  leadership  role  in  catalyzing \nincreased awareness and appropriate regulatory incentives on the part of policy makers at the \nlocal, state, and national levels, as well as build technical capabilities on the part of housing \ndevelopers across various regions of India regarding the benefits of implementing certified green \nhousing. Through the proposed TA administered by ADB, IIFLHF will also benefit from expertise, \nbest practices and lessons learned from other UCCRTF supported projects, which can be \nreflected in the ongoing review of and inputs into TA activities conducted through the execution \nperiod. The TA seeks to achieve the following results by December 2022: \n \n(i)  Capacity building and trainings: IIFLHF will organize training sessions for its technical \nteam\u2019s  on  site  risk  assessment  and  climate  adaptation  measures,  and  on  the  green \ncertification process for climate resilient buildings and arrange for individual certifications from \nIGBC/GRIHA for its technical staff. Similar training will also be provided for developers\u2019 staff. \nIn addition, IIFLHF will facilitate trainings for various local or state housing boards on the site \nrisk assessment, climate adaptation measures, and the green certification process. \n \n(ii) Knowledge  exchange  events:  IIFLHF  will  organize  Kutumb  meetings  to  facilitate  the \nexchange of ideas and increase awareness among various stakeholders regarding the climate \nrisk mitigation and climate risk adaptation benefits and appropriate policy frameworks to \npromote adoption of green certified housing standards in the affordable housing segment. The \ncompany will conduct at least one National Level  thought leadership event on Climate \nResilient and Green Affordable Housing each year during the TA\u2019s life and will also conduct \nat least thought leadership and knowledge product to disseminate lessons learned and best \npractices in green affordable housing with HFCs and other affordable housing stakeholders \nin South Asia. To promote the uptake of climate resilient green certified housing, IIFLHF will \nconduct  community  engagement  activities  with potential  borrowers  from EWS  and LIG \nsegments, and female borrowers.  \n \n(iii) Market research activities and Innovative Technologies: The TA activities will include \nseveral market research initiatives across the entire value chain of climate resilient green \nhousing and formulate strategies to build the ecosystem. These will include: (i) assessing \ncurrent awareness regarding climate resilient green affordable housing by prospective buyers \nand developers and establishing a baseline of consumer understanding; (ii) formulating a \nunified green building ratings system to encompass tailored adaptations to the local climate \nzones of various regions across India; (iii) establishing a system to integrate green lending \nand climate adaptation strategies in the context of affordable housing; (iv) identifying cost \neffective innovative green technologies by collaborating with suitable research institutes; and \n(v) preparing guidelines for mainstreaming gender in green housing. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,150,000, of which $1,000,000 will financed on a grant basis \nby  Urban Climate  Change Resilience Trust  Fund  (UCCRTF)18 under  the Urban  Financing \nPartnership Facility (UFPF) and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in \n \n18 Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \n \n ", "5 \nAppendix 1. Specific funding limitations that is set by ADB will be incorporated in the TA \nAgreement.  \n \n12.  IIFLHF  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  staff  resources,  office \naccommodation, supplies and administrative assistance, and other in-kind contributions. IIFLHF \nwill also finance and administer $150,000 from its own resources, separate from ADB\u2019s fund flow, \nas counterparty contribution towards the TA activities during the implementation period. IIFL was \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA and its Private Sector Operations Department, Financial \nInstitutions Division (PSFI) will be the focal point. ADB will be responsible for all technical \nimplementation issues. Consultants will remit deliverables to ADB.  ADB will disburse the TA \nfunds directly to the consultants based on their respective consulting contracts, following ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time  to time). TA \nimplementation is expected to begin in April 2021 and be completed by 31 December 2022. \nIIFLHF will continue to implement all the TA activities beyond December 2022 using its own funds. \n \n14.  The execution of the TA requires the selection of consultants for which ADB will conduct \nprocurement and ensure use of funds in compliance with relevant ADB policies, as well as monitor \noutputs and achievement of development effectiveness indicators.  IIFLHF will be responsible for \nthe preparation of the progress monitoring and evaluation (M&E) reports during the project and \nprovide ADB with annual TA progress reports, including information on the execution of target \nresults. \n \n15.  Pursuant  to  Article  14(iii)  of  the  ADB  Charter19,the  applicable  developing  member \ncountry's government's no objection to the implementation of the TA in the relevant country will \nbe established before the implementation or financing of the TA in that country. \n \n16.  A  summary  of  implementation  arrangements  is  accessible  from  the  list  of  linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2. Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time) and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as \namended from time to time). The TA will engage the services of three national consulting firms, \none for each of the outputs, and detailed qualification criteria have been outlined in each case.  \n \n17.  ADB has prepared detailed TOR and budget estimates for consultants, in consultation \nwith IIFHL. The expertise and the key selection and evaluation criteria will be set out in the TOR \nor requests for proposal (RFPs) for each contract.  \n \n18.  Cofinancier requirements. For UCCRTF, PSFI will submit annual progress reports on \nactivities, disbursements and the inception, interim, final and completion reports of the project. \nPSFI  will  also  facilitate  the  trust  fund\u2019s  secretariat  to  join  grant  review  missions  or \nevents/workshops organized by the project, as required.  \n \n19.
