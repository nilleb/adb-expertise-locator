The developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nare increasingly demanding knowledge and advisory support in this area. The paper on Putting \nADB\u2019s  Climate  Change  Program  into  Action,  which  was  discussed  in  the  management \ncommittee meeting on 18 April 2008, includes knowledge and advocacy support for the DMCs. \nThe concept paper for a regional technical assistance (RETA) to undertake a set of climate \nchange studies was subsequently approved for inclusion in the 2008 RETA program of ADB\u2019s \nRegional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department.  The  RETA  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A broad scientific consensus is that human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions \nare  causing  climate  change,  which  is  a  global  externality  with  potentially  catastrophic \nconsequences. Its causes and effects are highly unevenly distributed across countries and \ngenerations. Developing countries, particularly their poor populations, are likely to suffer the \nmost from the consequences of climate change, as they have limited capacity and resources to \nadapt and adjust to the impacts. Prospects of achieving the Millennium Development Goals, \nparticularly those related to poverty reduction, health, education, and environment, could decline \nsharply.  \n3.  The Asia and Pacific region community needs to improve its knowledge of these issues \nincluding understanding policy options to tackle climate change. Moreover, Asia is at the center \nof global climate change discussions because of its large share of projected increase in GHG \nemissions, its large population, and high vulnerability. The need for better understanding of \nclimate change issues in the region has also become important because of the ongoing time-\nbound discussions for reaching an agreement on the architecture of the international climate \nchange regime beyond 2012. These discussions are planned to conclude at the Conference of \nthe Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Copenhagen in \nDecember 2009.  \n4.  During  recent  years,  global  knowledge  about  climate  change  issues  has  increased \nsubstantially and the body of research continues to grow rapidly. However, region- and country-\nspecific knowledge about climate change in the Asia and Pacific region is sparse. Policy makers \nand researchers in the DMCs and the region face significant knowledge gaps with respect to \ncurrent and future climate change challenges. Asia cannot afford to be left behind in this \nimportant area. Thus, knowledge and insights on climate change need to be increased to \nsupport regional, subregional, and national policy formulation. Conducting in-depth studies and \nbuilding region-specific knowledge of climate change issues will be important components.  \n5.  The  Stern  Review2  and  the  Fourth  Assessment  Report3  of  the  United  Nation\u2019s \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change cover a broad range of climate change issues \nincluding impact, mitigation, and adaptation. Most of these apply to all regions of the world. \nThus building region-specific knowledge in areas most relevant to the Asia and Pacific region is \n                                                 \n1  ADB Management cleared the concept paper on 30 May 2008. The RETA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 June 2008.  \n2  Government of the United Kingdom. 2006. Report on the Economics of Climate Change. Stern Review. London: \nTreasury Office of the Government of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. \n3   IPCC. 2007.  Climate Change 2007. Fourth Assessment  Report. Geneva. \n ", "2 \nneeded. Three items are among the most important issues for policy makers in the region: \nclimate change and energy, building climate resilience in the agriculture sector, and climate \nchange and mitigation. \n \n6.   Climate Change and Energy. Energy is a critical input for maintaining rapid growth and \nsteadily  improving  living  standards  in  the  region.  The  source  of  more  than  half  of  GHG \nemissions, energy is at the core of climate change mitigation. As economies in the region grow \nto  constitute  a  larger  share  of  global  GHG  emissions, managing  energy  use  is  becoming \nincreasingly important. Thus, energy is an area of strong convergence of interest between \nindividual and collective country needs of the region and the world. The projected investment in \nAsia\u2019s energy sector until 2030 far exceeds other regions; this offers major opportunities to shift \nto a low carbon path. There is also strong convergence between actions required to contain \nGHG  emissions  from  energy  as  a  public  good  (or  bad),  and  actions  required  to  provide \nadequate energy inputs as a private good for continuing economic development. For example, \ncoordinated global action for improving energy efficiency and developing new  and diverse \nsources  of  energy,  as  part  of  climate  change  mitigation  efforts,  will  greatly  contribute  to \naddressing energy security problems. The DMCs have taken several new initiatives to improve \nenergy efficiency and to diversify alternative energy sources including renewables. Several \nproven technologies that result in a reduction of global GHG emissions are not being rapidly \ntransferred  and  diffused  in  the  DMCs.  Continuously  examining  current  developments  and \nexperiences, assessing what works and what does not, and identifying low carbon approaches \nthat show greater promise in this region are important. The need to properly analyze the key \nremaining barriers from financing and technology transfer perspectives is urgent. Updating our \nknowledge and understanding of these will help improve the results of ongoing efforts and \nencourage exploration of new options for the Asia and Pacific region.  \n    \n7.  Building Climate Resilience in the Agriculture Sector. Climate change is affecting \nand/or likely to affect agriculture in the region in many ways, including a decline in crop yield, \nmoisture loss, change in duration of seasons, extreme weather (e.g., drought and floods), loss \nof water due to glacier melting, and loss of land due to rising sea level. Freshwater availability in \ncentral, south, east, and southeast Asia is projected to decrease. The impact of climate change \non agriculture will be different for different countries in the region. Countries located closer to the \nequator, where temperatures already tend to be close to crop tolerance levels, are likely to \nsuffer the most. Developing countries in general stand to lose more from the effects of climate \nchange on agriculture, as agriculture constitutes a larger share of the gross domestic product of \npoorer economies. A decline in agricultural production in the region can have a devastating \neffect  because  of  the  large  population.  Despite  these  risks,  the  region\u2019s  knowledge  and \nunderstanding of impact and adaptation in agriculture is weak, and few concrete actions have \nbeen initiated. The region needs to better understand the profile of risks and vulnerabilities of \nagriculture in different parts of the region; how it will impact economic growth, poverty reduction, \nand food security in the region; and how the shift toward biofuel could affect food production in \nthe region. The stock of region-specific knowledge must improve for the Asia and Pacific region \nto be better prepared to deal with these eventualities.   \n \n8.  Climate Change and Migration. Climate change has triggered a migration of people \nacross  regions  and  countries  by  causing  changes  in  weather,  temperature,  precipitation \npatterns, and sea level. In many cases, this is only adding to or catalyzing ongoing migration \ndue to other reasons. Estimates of current global refugees associated with climate change \nrange from 25 million to 50 million. Climate change can potentially cause large displacements \nand mass migration of people around the world. According to the Stern Review, more than  \n60 million people face the risk of displacement or migration in South Asia alone. Most Pacific \n ", "3\n \nisland countries face a high risk of population displacement and even complete abandonment. \nThese could result in creating millions of displaced persons or refugees disturbing the traditional \nsocial fabric, and causing extreme agony and hardship in the region. This is a major adverse \nsocial consequence of climate change, for which the region needs to prepare in advance. The \nAsia and Pacific region has the largest population living on coast lines and river deltas. The \nproblem needs to be quantified and planning and preparatory work started, including building \nnecessary legal and financial arrangements to result in smooth and proper rehabilitation of \naffected people when needed. This requires improving knowledge and understanding of the \nrisks and vulnerabilities of population displacement and migration in different parts of the region \nunder various scenarios, how it will impact the socioeconomic structure of the region, what are \nthe barriers to refugee movements within and across national boundaries, and how the region \ncould cope with these under different possible scenarios. The role of regional cooperation needs \nto be examined in depth in the context of climate change and migration, as it will involve cross-\nborder population movements as well. \n \n9.  ADB needs to take a leadership role in developing region-specific knowledge products \non climate change. Currently, its only major  ongoing study on the subject,  Review of the \nEconomics of Climate Change in Southeast Asia4, is a follow-up study on the Government of \nthe United Kingdom\u2019s Stern Review. It covers only a subregion of Asia.5 ADB should expand its \nknowledge work on the subject and undertake new studies, covering the entire Asia and Pacific \nregion, which comprises diverse areas including island-based economies that are vulnerable to \na likely rise in sea level, tropical regions that are prone to droughts, and colder regions that may \neven initially benefit from global warming. To provide adequate depth and add value, these \nstudies should focus on selected issues considered highly relevant to the region. Further, to \nmake a strong impact, these studies should be published and disseminated widely before the \nDecember 2009 Conference of the Parties in Copenhagen. Preparation of these studies will be \nin line with ADB\u2019s long-term strategic framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020) and the new \nEnergy Strategy,6 which assign high priority to climate change and knowledge solutions. This \nRETA  will  also  support  ongoing  efforts  by  the  knowledge  departments7  to  improve  their \ncoordination through joint and collaborative work. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The RETA aims to support improvement of DMC preparedness to effectively address \nclimate change challenges. The main purpose is to improve region-specific knowledge and \nunderstanding of climate change challenges facing the Asia and Pacific region, and to make \nsuggestions for policy makers and development planners in the region about measures to \n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for a Regional Review on the Economics of Climate Change in Southeast Asia. \nManila (TA 6427-REG). \n5  ADB has a related ongoing technical assistance (ADB. 2007.

The new Energy Strategy, which was discussed during the management \nreview meeting on 20 May 2008, is for Management approval. \n7  ADB Institute, Economics and Research Department, Office of Regional Economic Integration, and Regional and \nSustainable Development Department. Formally, the ADB Institute is a subsidiary rather than a department or \noffice of ADB. \n ", "4 \naddress climate change in selected areas. The RETA will underline ADB\u2019s responsiveness to \nclient needs and support its knowledge transfer role in the region.    \n \n11.  The main output of the RETA will be three major publications on climate change and \nenergy, building climate resilience in the agriculture sector, and climate change and migration in \nthe context of the Asia and Pacific region. The target audience of these publications will be \npolicy makers and development planners in the region, particularly the DMCs. \n12.  These studies will include (i) a broad description of the issue in the Asia and Pacific \nregion along with data to substantiate trends and challenges; (ii) analysis of policy options for \nthe region; and (iii) specific suggestions on the way forward in the context of the region covering \npolicy, institutional, infrastructure, and financing aspects. The hallmark of these studies will be a \nhigh degree of focus on the Asia and Pacific region. Efforts will be made to disaggregate the \nanalysis to subregional, country, and subnational levels, as possible, and make differentiated \nsuggestions, as appropriate.  \n13.  At this stage, only the main topics and a broad outline of these studies have been \nidentified. The study teams will have adequate flexibility to introduce necessary refinements to \ndistinguish these publications from others and to add value to the existing literature. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The key activities for each study under this RETA will essentially involve three main \nphases: \n    \n(i)  First phase. Prepare a detailed outline of the study and identify suitable data \nsources based on literature review, and internal and external consultations. Key \nconsiderations in preparing the detailed outline will be the needs of the region, \nexisting  knowledge  gaps,  and  value  addition  by  the  study.  The  primary \nconsiderations  in  identifying  suitable  data  sources  will  be  authenticity, \nacceptability, and accessibility. This phase will involve identifying special studies \nor background papers required to complete the study.  \n \n(ii)  Second phase. Prepare background papers and complete the analytical phase \nof the study according to the outline finalized in the first phase. This will be done \nthrough in-depth research and analysis, internal and external consultations, and \ndiscussion in workshops. This phase will involve peer review and external expert \nreview of the study findings. Special efforts will be made to ensure consistency \nand coherence in the work of different team members. The final output of this \nphase will be the draft manuscript of the study combining all the inputs and \nreview feedback.   \n \n(iii)  Third phase. Print and launch the study. The study will be formally released \nalong  with  appropriate  press  notes  and  publicity  material  to  ensure  proper \ndissemination of the findings. The study findings will be further disseminated \nthrough other media opportunities, such as national, regional, and/or international \nconferences and the ADB website. In addition, selected background papers will \nbe published separately.   \n \n15.  The study teams will draw on a wide range of information including existing data and \nliterature, and internal and external feedback. Selected special studies and background papers \n ", "5\n \nwill be commissioned to provide specialized and technical inputs. To ensure quality, the draft \nstudies will be reviewed by selected external experts. After finalization of the drafts, subject \nspecialist editors and copy editors will edit the manuscript. Selected studies and background \npapers will be published individually or as a compilation, as appropriate, depending on their \nquality and contribution to the literature.  \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the RETA is estimated at $1.25 million. The RETA will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s technical assistance funding program. The cost estimates and financing \nplan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  RETA.  The  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department, as the nodal department for the RETA, will manage implementation \nincluding  overall  coordination  and  administration.  RETA  activities  will  be  undertaken  in \ncollaboration  with  regional  departments,  other  knowledge  departments  (ADB  Institute, \nEconomics and Research Department, and Office of Regional Economic Integration),8 and \nrelevant communities of practice. The work of each study will be undertaken by a team of staff, \nexternal experts, consultants, and resource persons. Preparation of these studies may involve \npartnerships with suitable external organizations to leverage additional expertise.  \n \n18.  RETA implementation will require (i) about 24 person-months equivalent of international \nconsulting  services  of  diverse  expertise  including  climate  change,  energy,  agriculture,  and \nmigration; (ii) preparation of a few background papers separately using specialized technical \ninputs  or  field  studies;  and  (iii)  about  24  person-months  equivalent  of  national  consulting \nservices to provide administrative and research support. About 1 person-month each of a \nsubject specialist editor and a copy editor will be required for formal publication of each study \n(total 6 person-months of international consultants). To provide the international consulting \nservice  inputs  and  prepare  background  papers,  a  firm  will  be  engaged  to  support  the \npreparation of each study. As these studies are to be completed in a short time and require \nhighly specialized skills, these firms will be recruited following the consultants' qualifications \nselection  method.  In  special  cases,  single  source  selection  may  be  used  for  which  full \njustification will be provided to Central Operations Services Office separately for approval. ADB \nwill separately recruit subject specialist editors and copy editors, and national consultants on an \nindividual basis. Organization of workshops and seminars will be handled by ADB separately. \nFurther, ADB staff will participate in consultations and workshops, both at and away from \nheadquarters, as resource persons. Preparation of these studies will involve review by selected \nregional and global experts and institutions of high repute, and other specialized analytical \ninputs. Experts for these will be engaged separately as resource persons, which is considered \nappropriate because the activities involved will be of short duration. All consultants and resource \npersons will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, \nas amended from time to time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. The outline terms \nof reference are in Appendix 3. The RETA will be implemented over 20 months, starting in \nAugust 2008 and ending in March 2010. The RETA\u2019s outcome should be evaluated based on \n                                                 \n8  A no objection will be obtained from the government of the DMC concerned in accordance with ADB. 2007. \nOperations Manual.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is undertaking three climate change studies to build \nregion-specific knowledge in the context of the Asia and Pacific region to address the following \nthree issues considered highly relevant for the region: climate change and energy, building climate \nresilience in the agriculture sector, and climate change and migration.    \n \n2.  Three teams of international consultants and resource persons will be engaged to support \nthe preparation of these studies. In addition, suitable subject specialist and copy editors will be \nengaged to support publication of the studies. Each of the teams will have a leader responsible for \nconsolidating the inputs from team members and finalizing the study. Each team leader will ensure \nregular  communications  among  team  members  and  timely  completion  of  all  required  outputs \nincluding editing and printing of the final publication. The team leaders of the studies will coordinate \nwith each other to ensure no conflict between data use, analysis, or conclusion of the three studies. \nPreparation of each study will include an appropriate review of literature and summary of relevant \ncurrent  knowledge  on  the  subject,  which  will  provide  a  platform  for  clear  value  addition and \nadvancement of knowledge. The consultants and resource persons will be invited to Manila from \ntime  to  time  for  discussion,  participation  in  workshops,  and  presentation  of  the  drafts,  as \nappropriate.  \n \nB.  Climate Change and Energy Consultants (international, 8 person-months)  \n \n3.  The team of climate change and energy specialists will have extensive knowledge and \nexperience  in  economic,  policy,  technology,  and  financing  issues  in  the  energy  sector.  Their \nresponsibilities include the following:  \n \n(i)  Briefly describe the current and projected energy demand and greenhouse gas \n(GHG) emissions from production and use of energy in the Asia and Pacific region \nbased on suitable data sources. Discuss the assumptions used in various energy \ndemand projections in developing Asian countries to offer a more realistic scenario. \nDiscuss  the  scenario  when  the  entire  population  in  the  region  has  access  to \ncommercial forms of energy.  \n(ii)  Analyze the alignment between efforts to reduce GHG emissions and to address \nenergy  security  concerns  in  the  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  Identify \nareas of convergence and of divergence, why progress in the areas of convergence \nhas been slow, and how the gaps in the areas of divergence could be reduced.  \n(iii)  Conduct an analysis of recent experiences in energy efficiency, cleaner use of fossil \nfuel, and diversification of energy supply in the Asia and Pacific region. The analysis \nof experience in energy efficiency should cover all key supply sources (e.g., fossil \nfuel, hydropower, biofuel, renewable, nuclear) and all the main demand areas (e.g., \nhousehold, industry, commerce, transport). In general, the analysis should inform \nwhat works well, what does not work well, and what shows greater promise in this \nregion. In particular, the analysis should focus on identifying the key remaining \nbarriers related to financing, transfer, and diffusion of technology. While the analysis \nshould cover the entire region, large DMCs accounting for most of the energy \nconsumption in the region should be suitably studied to reflect their importance in \nthis context. \n(iv)  In relation to financing energy efficiency and clean energy, examine the following in \nthe context of the Asia and Pacific region: (a) cost of various options including the \nimpact of carbon credits, (b) structure of energy efficiency and clean energy markets, \nand their implications for investment and financing in the sector, (c) availability of \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \nfinancing options and constraints, (d) scope of tax on carbon emission, (e) role of \nresource transfer from industrialized countries to the DMCs, and (f) how to increase \nthe role of the private sector in energy efficiency and clean energy.  \n(v)  Conduct  an  analysis  of  the  technological  gap  in  the  energy  sector  between \nindustrialized countries and the DMCs, and recent trends in technology transfer from \nthe former to the latter.

Responsibilities will \ninclude the following:  \n \n(i)  Identify suitable sources of data and projections related to population displacement \nand migration for further disaggregation and analysis using standard techniques.  \n(ii)  Describe how climate change would cause population displacement and migration \nin the Asia and Pacific region through phenomenon such as drought, desertification, \nsea level rise, extreme weather, coastal flooding, shoreline erosion, agricultural \ndegradation, seawater intrusion into freshwater aquifers, storm surge, disease, and \nstress on natural resources. Describe various scenarios covering short-, medium-, \nand long-term periods not to extend beyond the end of this century. Focus the \ndiscussion on the first half of this century, especially the early decades. Distinguish \nbetween  long-term  or  permanent  population  displacement  and  migration  from \nsudden reversible displacements such as those due to periodic natural disasters, \nwith a view to focusing on the former. \n(iii)  Map  out  the  risks  and  vulnerabilities  of  population  displacement  and  migration \nfacing different parts of the region along with the reasons thereof under different \npossible scenarios. In this regard, the level of disaggregating will largely be guided \nby the availability of data. However, at the minimum, the description of risks and \nvulnerabilities should cover all the main subregions (East Asia, Central Asia, South \nAsia, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific) of the Asia and Pacific region. In addition, \ndiscuss specific countries or geographic areas (e.g., low-lying areas and costal \ncities in a subregion or a country) facing high risk separately.
