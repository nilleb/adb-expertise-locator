INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will assess the progress \nmade during 2010\u20132016 on the recommendations of the Integrated Energy Sector Recovery \nReport of the Friends of Democratic Pakistan (FODP), analyze the lessons learned from the \nchanging global realities, and propose recommendations as inputs for a new energy policy for the \nmedium term (2018\u20132023).1 The findings will be designed to inform the Government of Pakistan \non past progress and provide options for the future energy strategy of the country.2\n \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is the lead and anchor development partner of the \nGovernment  of  Pakistan  in  the  energy  sector  with  an  ongoing  portfolio  of  $2.8  billion  in \ninvestments in energy generation, transmission, distribution, energy efficiency, renewable energy \ndevelopment, and analytical and advisory assistance. The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Pakistan, 2015\u20132019 and is included in ADB\u2019s current country operations \nbusiness plan, 2018\u20132020 for Pakistan.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  A reliable and sustainable energy sector is essential to Pakistan\u2019s economic growth and \nsustainability. Economic growth improved between FY2010 and FY2016, but was still lower than \nin the preceding decade. A major hurdle in achieving further growth is the intense energy \nshortage. 4  Although  Pakistan  has  abundant  renewable  and  sizable  conventional  energy \nresources, public and private investment in energy infrastructure has not been sufficient to meet \ndemand. Electricity supply must be further improved by stepping up efficiency, and operation and \nmaintenance of generation, transmission, and distribution networks. Although electricity outages \nhave declined and become more predictable since 2010, the 5-gigawatt demand\u2013supply gap \ncombined with the stressed transmission and distribution system continues to result in significant \nload shedding\u201410 hours per day in rural areas and 5 hours in urban areas.5 The national \nelectrification rate remains low at around 67%, and is even lower (57%) in rural areas. Some \nimprovements in sector efficiency, low fuel prices since 2014, and introduction of surcharges have \ncontributed to managing financial challenges in the sector. However, continued reliance on \nimported fuel-based generation and high consumer receivables, accentuated by insufficient tariffs, \nhave resulted in a persistent circular debt.  \n \n4.  The power subsector relies heavily on government support\u2014direct subsidies amounted \nto about 1.5% of gross domestic product in FY2016. Costs that cannot be recovered from \nconsumers or the government accumulate on the books of the public electricity distribution \ncompanies. The distribution companies in turn fail to pay fully for goods and services they receive, \nespecially electricity, thus spreading the shortfall throughout the supply chain. Commonly called \nthe circular debt, these accumulated arrears amounted to about 4% of gross domestic product in \nFY2013.6 Actions are required to remove two main distortions: (i) the long-standing gap between \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 Jun 2017. \n2  FODP Energy Sector Task Force. 2010.

Manila. \n6  Circular debt is the amount of cash shortfall within the Central Power Purchasing Agency, which it cannot pay to \npower supply companies. The overdue amount is a result of the (i) difference between the actual cost and the tariff \ndetermined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, which entails loss for a distribution company; (ii) \n ", "2 \nthe cost of service and revenues gained either from tariffs or subsidies; and (ii) the unusually high \ncost of providing that service. At the same time, inequities caused by poorly targeted subsidies \nmust be rectified to ensure that the sector develops in a socially and environmentally sustainable \nway. \n \n5.  In 2009, the FODP, recognizing the impact of persistent energy shortages on the economy \nand livelihoods, solicited the preparation of a sustainable and integrated energy plan for Pakistan.7 \nThe government and ADB led the effort by creating the Pakistan Energy Sector Task Force to \nprepare  an  energy  sector  recovery  report  with  a  comprehensive  road  map  for  mobilizing \ninternational assistance and a recommended action plan to solve energy security problems. The \ngovernments of the United States, Japan, and Germany, among other development partners, \nformed the core team with the chairs and finalized the report in October 2010, which was \npresented to the ministerial meeting of the FODP comprising 24 countries and institutions. The \nrecommendations  of  the  report  were  subsequently  fed  into the  Petroleum  Exploration  and \nProduction Policy 2012 and the National Power Policy 2013.8 ADB has supported the reforms \nthrough three subprograms of the Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program loan in concert \nwith the International Monetary Fund-assisted Extended Fund Facility and cofinancing from the \nWorld Bank, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the French Development Agency. \n \n6.  Under the Petroleum Exploration and Production Policy 2012, the government enhanced \nthe wellhead pricing terms for natural gas producers. The response has been positive: 50 offers \nwere received in a recent bidding for 58 blocks with exploration and production rights. However, \nthe response from foreign companies remained subdued, even after the gas price rose from $4 \nto $6 per million British thermal units for some zones. A Tight Gas Policy for exploration and \nproduction was announced in May 2011. The policy gives a 40% premium over the respective \nprice for each zone under the 2009 policy. Under the 18th constitutional amendment, provinces \nwere awarded greater authority in the approval process for oil and gas sector affairs, which has \ndelayed exploration in some cases. In addition, the Petroleum Rules 2013 were modified to \ndisburse the royalty share directly to the provinces instead of channeling these through the federal \ngovernment, which had been a long-standing provincial grievance. \n \n7.  The National Power Policy 2013 encourages independent power producers to invest in \nnew power plants or to convert existing ones to operate on less-expensive fuels. In the medium \nterm, low-cost gas pipelines, coal, and hydropower projects will be implemented. In the long term, \nlarge infrastructure hydropower projects will be completed, and existing high-cost energy projects \nand contracts will be retired, to ensure more affordable electricity generation. \n \n8.  Pakistan is vulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change. Landslides and erosion \nhave resulted in siltation of water reservoirs. Changes in rainfall patterns and glacial melt have \nalso reduced hydropower generation output. Although Pakistan\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions are \nlow by global standards, carbon emissions in Pakistan grew by 105% (from 152.79 million tons in \n1990 to 313.48 million tons in 2010). The significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, \n \n                                                \ndelayed or nonpayment of subsidies by government; and (iii) delayed determination and notification of tariffs. It is the \ngovernment's policy to reduce and limit the circular debt overtime and to address and eliminate its causes. \n7  The 2010 report recommended five key areas of reforms and investments: (i) strengthen energy sector governance \nand regulation, (ii) rationalize pricing and energy subsidies, (iii) develop energy finance capability, (iv) mainstream \nenergy efficiency into energy policy, and (v) fast-track investment projects for energy security. \n8  The policy seeks to eliminate load shedding by 2017, by (i) reducing the average system-wide generation cost from \n$0.12 per kilowatt-hour to $0.10 per kilowatt-hour by 2018, (ii) decreasing transmission and distribution losses from \nthe current 25%\u201328% to 16% by 2018, and (iii) increasing revenue collection from 85% to 95% of total billing. \n ", "3 \nparticularly carbon dioxide, is mainly attributed to the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, \ntransport, and manufacturing. \n \n9.  The sector underpinned the manifesto of all political parties in previous elections in May \n2013, and is again emerging as a key factor in the political landscape of Pakistan in the run-up to \nits national elections in May 2018. The government has requested ADB to update the 2010 FODP \nenergy report and to revise its action plan by reflecting the progress made in the energy sector \nas per recommendations of the FODP report, and the frameworks of the power and petroleum \npolicies, and to confirm residual issues and options for the next steps. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: achieve an efficient and financially sustainable \nenergy sector. 9 The TA will have the following outcome: findings of the report fed into Pakistan\u2019s \nnew energy policy for the medium term (2018\u20132023).10  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n11.  It is envisaged that the TA outputs will inform the government on the progress on the key \npoints identified in the FODP report in 2010 and recommendations from this assessment. \nTogether with the views from other development partners, the output of the TA will be available \nas input to the new energy sector policy for the next medium term from FY2018 to FY2023. \n \n12.  To provide inputs for the government, the TA will build upon (i) the recommendations of \nthe 2010 FODP report, (ii) ADB\u2019s experience in the sector, (iii) other related knowledge products \nand the government\u2019s recently implemented strategic policy initiatives in the sector, and (iv) recent \nglobal technology- and energy-related developments\u2014e.g., drop in fossil fuel prices, shale \nrevolution, and improvements in renewable energy technologies (solar and wind) to reduce prices. \nThe advisory and analytical assessments under the TA will cover the progress made on the 2010 \nFODP report\u2019s recommendations, as well as energy sector constraints in Pakistan. The report will \nanalyze what was achieved, suggest measures for improvements, and summarize the lessons \nfor the future. \n \n13.  Output  1:  Key  energy  sector  analyses  and  recommendations  for  2018\u20132023 \nprepared. The consultants will review and analyze improvements achieved in the electricity and \ngas subsectors since 2010 by discussing and reviewing subsector policies and regulations with \nthe government, international development partners, and the private sector. The analysis will \nevaluate progress and formulate inputs into the next 5-year (2018\u20132023) energy sector strategy \nof  Pakistan,  including  lessons, recommendations,  and  implementation  action  plans for key \nsubsectors. The progress will be discussed and reported to the stakeholders in monthly meetings \nof the steering committee chaired by the Economic Affairs Division, in coordination with the \nMinistry of Water and Power and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources of the \nGovernment of Pakistan. \n \n                                                \n9  TA-defined. Rectifying the infrastructure deficit in the energy sector is critical to overcoming challenges posed by \nsupply-chain bottlenecks to growth and poverty reduction. \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \n14.  Output 2: Stakeholder views on progress during 2010\u20132017 collected. The analysis \nwill be based on ongoing consultation with the government and development partners, but the \nresult of the assessments and draft reports from output 1 will also be disseminated to these \nstakeholders to consolidate their inputs. The drafts will be circulated both electronically and in \nprinted copies, and a concluding coordination meeting will be convened to finalize the report. \n \n15.  The TA approach to this intervention is deemed appropriate because it (i) will continue \nanalytical work co-led by ADB in 2010 and largely supported by the FODP report, and builds on \nthe policy reforms supported by ADB\u2019s policy-based loans with cofinanciers; (ii) requires limited \nfunding; and (iii) can be implemented fast by immediately recruiting the individual consultants and \nhaving a report completed by 31 May 2018. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $510,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF VI). The government is soliciting additional \nsupport and cofinancing to complement the TA work, and will provide counterpart support in the \nform of staff support, office space, access to data, and by hosting meetings of stakeholders, and \nother  in-kind  contributions  amounting  to  $10,000.  The  key  expenditure  items  are  listed  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n17.  Parallel cofinancing is envisaged to be provided by other bilateral and multilateral partners \nto support the work of the consultants. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the implementing agency and will administer the TA. The Economic Affairs \nDivision  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  government\u2019s  lead  focal  division  to  engage  with \ndevelopment partners and external aid, will be the executing agency. The Energy Division of \nADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department will organize the workshops; and select, supervise, and \nevaluate consultants and resource persons for the workshops, if required. The output of the \nconsultants will be approved by the steering committee. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  15 August 2017\u201315 May 2018 \nExecuting agency  Economic Affairs Division of the Ministry of Finance, Government of \nPakistan \nImplementing agency  Energy Division, Central and West Asia Department, ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nICS  10 person-months  $250,000 \nInternational \nconsultants \nICS  24 person-months  $160,000 \nNational consultants \nAdvance contracting and retroactive  Not applicable \nfinancing \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \nDisbursement  The technical assistance resources will be disbursed following ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Not applicable \narrangement upon technical \nassistance completion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, ICS = individual consultant selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n19.
