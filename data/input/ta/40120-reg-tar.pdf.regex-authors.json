Over  the  past  decade,  global  commitment  to  sustainable  development  has  been \nreaffirmed in extensive documentation and meetings at the highest political levels, strongly \nsupported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). At the 2006 Delhi Sustainable Development \nSummit (DSDS),1 it was agreed that ADB would be an appropriate organization to create a \nregional platform to continue dialogue on the sustainable development agenda. The proposed \nAsian  Sustainable  Development  Summit  (the  summit)  is  a  response  to  demands  from \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) to enhance ADB\u2019s knowledge network to provide a global \nperspective on sustainable development issues in the Asia and Pacific region.   \n \n2.  The scope and direction of the ADB technical assistance (TA) grant2 to support the \nproposed summit were defined in the concept paper approved by Management on 15 August \n2006. The TA is included as a firm activity in the work program of the Regional and Sustainable \nDevelopment Department (RSDD) of ADB. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The concept and practice of sustainable development has gained increasing and urgent \nattention during the past few years, as the world begins to see more clearly the implications of \nthe shrinking natural resources needed to support growing populations. It is not just that there \nwill be more people, but that enormous changes in complex ecosystems\u2014natural and human-\nbuilt\u2014require significant technological innovations and adaptations in lifestyles now to meet the \ndemands of coming generations. The Brundtland Report defined sustainable development as \n\u201cdevelopment that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet their own needs\u201d.3 That understanding was recently highlighted in the \nMillennium Ecosystem Assessment\u2019s \u201cstark warning\u201d that \u201cthe ability of the planet\u2019s ecosystem \nto sustain future generations can no longer be taken for granted\u201d and that \u201cresilience and \nabundance can no longer be confused with indestructibility and indefinite supply.\u201d4 A recent \nreport has an even more dire warning on the impending disastrous consequences of climate \nchange, which is a key dimension of sustainability. The report asserts that climate change is \n\u201cglobal in its causes and consequences [with] international collective action \u2026 critical [to] driving \nan effective, efficient and equitable response.\u201d5 Reassuringly, despite political setbacks, there \nhas  been  continuing  and  growing  responsiveness  of  governments,  corporations, \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs), and varied interest groups to address the sustainability \nissue. In the past few decades, responses to the challenges of sustainability have been evolving \nin several summits, forums, intergovernmental and nongovernment meetings, country policies, \nand multilateral and private sector initiatives devoted to sustainability issues.6  \n                                                 \n1  New Delhi. 2\u20134 February 2006. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 7 December 2006. \n3  World Commission on Environment and Development, United Nations (UN). 1987.

This publication points out that \n\u201cclimate change will affect the basic elements of life for people around the world \u2013 access to water, food production, \nhealth, and the environment. Hundreds of millions of people could suffer hunger, water shortages and coastal \nflooding as the world warms \u2026 the overall costs and risks of climate change will be equivalent to losing at least 5% \nof global [gross domestic product] GDP each year, now and forever.\u201d \n6  Some of the most notable global meetings have been the (i) UN Conference on Human Environment, 1972; (ii) UN \nConference on Environment and Development (UNCED), 1992; (iii) World Summit for Social Development, 1995; \n(iv)  World  Summit  on  Sustainable  Development,  2002;  (v)  UN  Conference  on  Financing  for  Development \n ", "2   \n \n4.   Sustainable development issues are being tackled on several intergenerational levels\u2014\neconomic,  environmental,  social,  legal,  administrative,  scientific,  and  technological,  among \nothers. There are many challenges to sustainable development on these levels, with key issues \nof global concern covering such areas as the management of natural resources, improving \ngovernance,  establishing  social  sustainability,  increasing  agricultural  productivity,  and \naddressing climate change.7 However, it is generally agreed that sustainability is not about \nbalancing. Rather, it aims at multiple reinforcing gains with a combination of a limited set of \nfundamental,  broadly  applicable  requirements  for  progress,  and  considerations  specific  to \nlocation and context.8 The multidisciplinary dimensions of the problems also require global \naccountability for sustainable development. Sustainable development, then, \u201cinvolves a process \nof deep and profound change in the political, social, economic, institutional, and technological \norder, including redefinition of relations between developing and more developed countries.\u201d9 \nThat  process  requires  debate,  understanding,  and  exchange  of  ideas  among  leaders, \ndevelopment practitioners, civil society, and the private sector\u2014at forums that will increase \nawareness  and  bring  together  countries  and  institutions  in  formulating,  financing,  and \nimplementing action plans for all dimensions of sustainable development.  \n \n5.  In ADB\u2019s sphere of operations, the Asia and Pacific region is \u201cvast and diverse, with \u2026 \n[Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and the People\u2019s Republic of China] \u2026 accounting for \ntwo-thirds of all people living in rural areas without access to sanitation, underweight children, \npeople living on less than a dollar a day, and of tuberculosis cases worldwide.\u201d10 On the other \nhand, the Asia and Pacific region is the fastest growing and most dynamic region in the world. \nAmong Asia\u2019s impressive accomplishments over the past three decades are the doubling of its \nshare of world gross domestic product (GDP), 30% increase in literacy rates, and increased life \nexpectancy by over 20 years. Developing Asia is expected to grow by 7.7% in 2006, easing to \n7.1% in 2007, with the People\u2019s Republic of China and India accounting for over 50% of regional \nGDP.11  \n \n6.  Although the outlook for Asia is significantly optimistic, that has to be tempered with the \nconcomitant strain on sustainability indicators. Asia remains on an unsustainable path with \ncontinuous population growth, widening income gaps, urban migration, and natural resource \ndepletion. A recent report notes that, \u201c\u2026 in the past quarter century, Asia has lost half of its \nforest cover and a third of its agricultural land has been degraded. Asia\u2019s rivers contain three to \nfour times more pollutants than the world average. Of the world\u2019s 15 most polluted cities, 13 are \nin Asia \u2026 at least one in three Asians still has no access to safe drinking water, and one in two \nhas no access to sanitation services \u2026 one-third of a billion tons of solid waste across Asia \nremains  uncollected  each  year  \u2026  [and]  millions  of  tons  of  hazardous  waste  are  placed \nuntreated in dumpsites, threatening groundwater and local food supplies.\u201d12 Hence, Asia\u2019s rapid \neconomic growth is at risk because of high levels of resource inefficiency and dependence on \n                                                                                                                                                          \n(Monterrey Consensus), 2002; (vi) UN World Summit, 2005; and (vii) Economic and Social Commission for Asia \nand the Pacific (ESCAP) Ministerial Conference on Environment and Development (MCED) in Asia and the Pacific \n2005. \n7  World Bank. 2006.

Ultimately, the poor will suffer most as they are most dependent on their \nenvironment for survival, and \u201cthe full potential of ecosystems as a wealth-creating asset for the \npoor\u2014not just a survival mechanism\u2014has yet to be effectively tapped.\u201d13 With the evident \nlinkages between poverty and the environment, global leaders continue to call for more action in \ntackling the disproportionately large impacts of environmental degradation on the poor.14 The \nright of the poor to enjoy environmental income may be increasingly characterized as one of \nSen\u2019s \u201cinstrumental freedoms\u201d.15 \n \n7.  Although there are worrisome trends in Asia\u2019s ability to sustain the economic and social \ngains made over the past few decades, several regional initiatives have sought to achieve \nagreement on policy directions for sustainable development. These include (i) acid deposition \nand dust and sand storms in northeast Asia, (ii) haze control in southeast Asia, and (iii) trans-\nboundary air pollution control in south Asia. ADB is also supporting regional cooperation through \nsuch initiatives as the Asian Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Network, Central \nAsian  Countries  Initiative  for  Land  Management,  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Biodiversity \nConservation Corridors Initiative, and Clean Air Initiative for Asian Cities (CAI-Asia). The private \nsector has also responded with \u201cgrowing acceptance of the principles and practices behind the \n[United Nations] UN Global Compact for Corporate Citizenship, the Global Reporting Initiative, \nand the Equator Principles applied to large private investments.\u201d16 \n \n8.  As regional development challenges change rapidly, ADB has responded with marked \nchanges  in  its  approach  and  operations  as  reflected  in  the  following:  (i)  reform  agenda; \n(ii) innovation and efficiency initiative; (iii) medium-term strategy II 2006\u20132008 (MTS II), which \nhas adopted \u201cManaging the Environment\u201d as one of the five strategic priorities;17 (iv) other new \ninitiatives (e.g., energy efficiency initiative); and (v) proposed review of the long-term strategic \nframework. Recently, ADB adopted a knowledge management framework in its efforts to evolve \ninto  a  more  knowledge-based  organization.  It  has  also  emphasized  improved  internal \nnetworking, as evidenced by reorganization of the communities of practice.  \n \n9.  As part of its efforts to strengthen external networking under a regional platform, ADB \nheld  the  first  Asia-Pacific  Forum  on  Poverty  (February  2001),  which  brought  together \nintellectuals and development practitioners. There is a clear need to continue to draw on global \nand regional knowledge with intellectuals and development leaders, who would conduct high-\nlevel discussions to generate new ideas and create stronger commitment to address emerging \nsustainability issues in the Asia and Pacific region. It was recently observed that \u201c[sustainability] \nissues can only be dealt in an integrated, systematic manner; yet \u2026 policies, institutions and \npractices remain highly compartmentalized with only limited mechanisms for integration and \ncooperation. Nowhere is the need for an integrated approach to these issues more compelling \nthan Asia.\u201d18  \n \n                                                 \n13 World Resources Institute. 2005.

Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The  main  purpose  of  the  regional  technical  assistance  (RETA)  is  to  enhance \ncoordination and harmonization among ADB, DMCs, and development partners on common \ndirections for sustainable development in the Asia and Pacific region, and thereby make a \nsubstantive  contribution  to  efforts  to  achieving  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  1 \n(eradicate extreme poverty and hunger) and 7 (ensure environmental sustainability).  \n \n11.  The growing pressure on Asia\u2019s environmental capital is intense enough to justify a high-\nlevel summit that would focus on reaffirming regional commitment to sustainability, accelerating \nthe implementation of regional action plans where those exist, and adopting frameworks and \nactions plans for DMCs in which progress has been slow. The proposed summit would also help \nstrengthen ADB\u2019s external profile, and draw attention to ADB initiatives to develop its knowledge \nleadership in sustainable development issues and the mainstreaming of those efforts into its \noperations. The summit will bring together a range of stakeholders from the region and the \nworld\u2014global and regional leaders, academics, development practitioners, research institutions, \ndevelopmental  organizations,  private  sector,  and  civil  society\u2014to  discuss  emerging \ndevelopment trends and issues in the Asia and Pacific region. Discussions and deliberations in \nthe summit will also contribute to ADB\u2019s stock of knowledge, improve its knowledge networking, \nand benefit the region through knowledge generation and identification of key future issues of \nthe region. The approach is consistent with the knowledge management framework, long-term \nstrategic framework, and the reform agenda. The summit will have the following products and \noutcomes: \n \n(i)  a platform for intellectually strong discussion and consensus-building among key \nstakeholders in sustainable development; \n(ii)  review of Asian policies and programs contributing to sustainable development in \nthe  region,  and  clear  recommendations  and  plans  of  action  to  improve  the \neffectiveness of such programs at both country and regional levels; \n(iii)  publication of a high quality knowledge product on summit outcomes; \n(iv)  high-quality documentation on trends and issues in selected sectors and themes \nfor use by policy makers, private sector, civil society, other stakeholders, and \nADB staff; \n(v)  visibility and demonstration of ADB\u2019s knowledge leadership in the region with \ndissemination of knowledge products; and \n(vi)  enhanced partnership and expanded intellectual network for ADB. \n \n12.  Owing to the very wide diversity and complexity of sustainable development themes, the \nsummit will (i) focus on issues of immediate importance to the Asia and Pacific region, and (ii) \nbe framed in the context of ADB\u2019s core operational sectors and priority areas identified under \nMTS II. Lead topics to be identified after interdepartmental discussions may include clean \nenergy, sustainable use of natural resources, and livable cities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.   The summit will involve plenary sessions, working sessions, briefings, and media events. \nThe summit will be structured around the following:   \n \n ", "  5\n(i)  Background papers. The summit will be preceded by the preparation of papers \non lead topics, including an overall background paper, and technical papers for \nthe individual working sessions, prepared by internationally recognized experts in \nsustainable development \n(ii)  The summit. The summit will involve a plenary session led by prominent leaders \n(e.g., current or former heads of states, ministers, senior public officials) of the \nregion, and technical or working sessions on specific issues. \n(iii)  Summit  documentation.  The  main  speeches,  key  suggestions,  important \noutcomes of the discussions, and background papers prepared for the technical \nor working sessions of the summit will be compiled and edited as knowledge \nproducts.  Those  will  be  published  selectively,  internally  and  externally,  as \nappropriate. An overall high-quality knowledge product will be published, based \non compilation of background technical papers prepared for discussion at the \nsummit. Subsequently, the outcomes will be widely disseminated through the \ninternet, various institutions, and the media using effective outreach materials. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  and  RSDD  will  be  responsible  for  overall \nimplementation  of  the  TA.  A  working  group  of  thematic  specialists  drawn  from  relevant \ndepartments will coordinate the selection of lead topics, review of technical papers, identification \nof  examples  of  good  practice,  and  general  thematic  directions  of  the  summit.  The  TA  is \nexpected to commence in February 2007 and be completed by November 2007.  \n \n16.  The summit will be held at ADB headquarters over 3 days during October 2007. It will \nbegin  with  a  plenary  session  at  which  distinguished  global  leaders  and  development \npractitioners\u2014representing developed countries, DMCs, development partners, civil society, \nand the private sector\u2014will speak on sustainable development challenges in Asia. The plenary \nsession will be followed by (i) parallel sessions on select topics relevant to DMCs and ADB, (ii) \nbreakout sessions on approaches to meeting sustainable development challenges, and (iii) a \nconcluding plenary session summing up the outcomes of the summit and identifying future \nactions and directions. Owing to the scale and level of participation at the summit, a consulting \nteam (a firm or individual consultants) will be engaged for event coordination. Background \npapers on sustainable development by internationally recognized experts will be commissioned \nfor the summit.  \n \n17.  General terms of reference for conduct of the summit are in Appendix 3. All consultants \nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2006, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.
