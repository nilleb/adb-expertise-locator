INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the National Bank of \nKazakhstan (NBK) to improve its supervisory authority, frameworks, and skills to assess the risk \nmanagement processes of banks, strengthen bank regulation and supervision, and support the \nintroduction of a risk-based approach as noted by the President of Kazakhstan in his state of the \nnation address on 31 January 2017.1 The TA entails the review of the NBK Law (1995), and the \nreview and introduction of the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) and internal \nliquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP) reports from banks in line with Basel II and III \nstandards. The TA aims to promote the resilience of the finance sector and support Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) funding operations to small and medium-sized enterprises.2 \n   \n2.  Subsequent to ADB consultations with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of National \nEconomy, and NBK, the governor of NBK requested the proposed TA on 21 June 2017.3 The TA \nsupports pillar 1 of the country partnership strategy in relation to increasing access to finance \nthrough banking sector reforms.4 It directly supports the performance of other ADB projects in \nKazakhstan aimed at supporting micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises by improving the \ngovernance of banks and improving the access of micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises to \nfinance, which have been identified as key constraints to economic diversification. 5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Kazakhstan\u2019s economy depends on oil export revenues, which in 2016 represented 17.5% \nof its gross domestic product (GDP) and more than 52.0% of export revenues.6 While GDP growth \nwas robust at an average 10.2% per annum during 2000\u20132007, economic performance has been \nvolatile since the 2008 global financial crisis. The economy rebounded with average GDP growth \nof 6.5% during 2010\u20132013, but declined to 4.2% (2014), 1.2% (2015), and 1.1% (2016) although \nit is expected to improve to 2.6% in 2017.7 The economic slowdown is largely influenced by the \nsharp drop in oil revenues, the recession in the Russian Federation, and weakening demand from \nKazakhstan\u2019s main trading partners. The reduction in foreign exchange income in 2015 prompted \nthe NBK to move to a floating exchange rate regime. The tenge lost 47% of its value against the \nUnited States (US) dollar from 2014 to 2016,8 and inflation more than doubled to 14.6% in 2016 \nfrom 6.7% in 2014 despite price controls and a restrictive monetary policy.  \n \n4.  The performance of the finance sector mirrors that of the economy. Economic shocks, \npoor credit underwriting, and currency devaluations have affected the performance and stability \n                                                \n1  Official Site of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

After consolidations and mergers, the five9 \nlargest banks hold about 58% of the banking system assets.10 High exchange rate volatility \nresulted in a surge of deposit dollarization from 35% (2010) to 70% (2015). Although the levels \ndecreased in 2016, US dollar-denominated loans remain elevated at 40% of total loans (from 43% \nin 2015), which indicates a sizeable dependency on currency hedging. \n \n5.  The sharp devaluation of the tenge against the US dollar seriously affected the solvency \nand profitability of some banks, including systematically important banks. Bank loans contracted \nby 3% in real terms in 2016. As a result, the banking system\u2019s depth, expressed by the ratio of \nprivate sector credit to GDP, weakened to 41% in 2016 (from 46% in 2015) (footnote 6). In \naddition, banks\u2019 lending in local currency was temporarily constrained by NBK\u2019s monetary policy \nand measures to counter currency speculation. \n \n6.  In 2016, banks were moderately capitalized, with a total capital adequacy ratio of 14.3%. \nWhile exceeding the regulatory minimum ratio of 7.5%, banking system solvency remains highly \nsusceptible to the volatile economy and unresolved asset quality issues. The significant volume \nof nonperforming loans (NPLs) will require write-offs and loan loss provisions over an extended \nperiod, and low net interest margins will limit banks\u2019 ability to generate additional capital through \nretained earnings. Additional capital will likely be needed to meet Basel III requirements, which \nare being phased in from 2017 until 2021. The NBK will also need to guide the banks and gain a \nbetter understanding of what can be expected from banks under ICAAP and ILAAP, and how to \nrun the supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) in compliance with Basel II and III \nPillar 2 standards. \n \n7.  In July 2017, the NBK reported NPLs at 10.7% of all loans. However, there are some \ndoubts about the reported level of NPLs in the sector as banks differ in the way they identify and \nreport impaired loans, including not declaring delinquent loans. In 2016, Moody\u2019s estimated \nproblems loans at 37% of total loans.11 \n \n8.  The NBK has introduced measures12 to tighten its prudential requirements and credit \nappraisal guidelines to prevent the future buildup of NPLs, but more improvements are needed to \naddress weaknesses in the sector. This is in line with the International Monetary Fund\u2019s mission \nof emphasizing the need to conduct stress testing and asset quality review of systematically \nimportant banks. 13 Persistent high NPLs affect bank profitability and the ability to extend credit, \nlimiting banks\u2019 ability to contribute to economic growth. A resilient financial system is required to \nsupport economic growth. To facilitate this, the NBK will need to develop an internal risk-based \nsupervisory methodology consistent with international best practices, and review bank reporting \npractices and assess the quality of independent audit in its supervisory evaluation. \n \n                                                \n9  This does not factor in the merger of Halyk Bank and Kazcommerstbank in July 2017. \n10 NBK. 2016.
