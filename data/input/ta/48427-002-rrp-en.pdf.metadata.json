This  practice  generates  a \nsubstantial negative carry, or rate of return, discourages the \ndevelopment of robust cash management at the Bureau of \nthe Treasury, and has led to a critical shortage of short-term \ntreasury bills. \n       \n  Bureau of the  \u2013  An  agency  of  the  Department  of  Finance  which,  under \nTreasury  Executive Order No. 449, acts as the principal custodian of \nthe financial assets of the Government of the Philippines and \nits  agencies  and  instrumentalities.  The  Treasury\u2019s  official \nduties can be found at \nhttp://www.treasury.gov.ph/aboutbtr/mission_main.html.  \n       \n  duration  \u2013  In finance, the duration of a financial asset that consists of \nfixed cash flows (e.g., a bond) is the weighted average time \nuntil repayment. When an asset is considered as a function \nof yield, duration also measures the price sensitivity to yield, \nthe rate  of  change  of price  with  respect  to  yield,  or the \npercentage change in price for a parallel shift in yields.  \n       \n  treasury single  \u2013  An essential tool for government cash management, this is \naccount  critical for ensuring that (i) all tax and nontax revenues are \ncollected,  and  payments  are  made  correctly  in  a  timely \nmanner; and (ii) government cash balances are optimally \nmanaged to reduce borrowing costs (or to maximize returns \non surplus cash). This is achieved by establishing a unified \nstructure of government bank accounts via a treasury single \naccount system. \n       \n  market maker  \u2013  A broker\u2013dealer firm that accepts the risk of holding a certain \n(market making)  number of shares of a particular security in order to facilitate \ntrading in that security. Each market maker competes for \ncustomer order flow by displaying buy and sell quotations for \na guaranteed number of shares. Once an order is received, \nthe market maker immediately sells from its own inventory, or \nseeks an offsetting order. This process takes place in mere \nseconds. \n       \n  primary dealer  \u2013  A set of preapproved financial institutions, which all bid for the \nright  to  participate  in  primary  auctions  of  government \nsecurities. Primary dealers are responsible for purchasing the \nmajority  of  government  securities  at  auction  and  then \nredistributing them to their clients, creating the initial market \nin the process. These institutions must meet certain liquidity \nand quality requirements. Specific privileges typically include \nactively  participating  in  primary  government  issuance \nprograms, providing liquidity by quoting effective two-way ", " \nprices  for  government  securities  (sales  and  repurchase \nagreements) under all market conditions, providing market \nfeedback to the monetary authorities, and contributing to the \ndevelopment  of  the  capital  market.  Privileges  are  often \ngranted  to  both  facilitate  and  compensate  for  these \nresponsibilities  and  include  exclusive  access  to  primary \nauctions of government securities (sometimes coupled with a \nhigher  noncompetitive  tender  limit  and  overall  allocation \nlimit), exclusive access to financing facilities that are used to \nfacilitate market-making, and close dialogue with monetary \nauthorities on the conduct of market-related issues. \n       \n  repurchase  \u2013  A form of short-term borrowing for dealers in government \nagreement  securities.  The  dealer  sells  the  government  securities  to \n(\u201crepo\u201d)  investors, usually on an overnight basis, with an agreement to \nrepurchase them at a set term for a set purchase price, which \nincludes repurchase interest. For the party selling the security \n(and agreeing to repurchase it in the future), it is a repurchase; \nfor the party on the other end of the transaction (buying the \nsecurity and agreeing to sell in the future), it is a reverse \nrepurchase agreement. \n       \n  self-regulatory  \u2013  A  self-regulatory  organization  is  a  non-government \norganization  organization  that  has  the  power  to  create  and  enforce \nindustry regulations and standards. Its priority is to protect \ninvestors  by  establishing  rules  that  promote  ethics  and \nequality.  Some  examples  of  self-regulatory  organizations \ninclude stock exchanges, the Investment Dealers Association \nof  Canada,  and  the  National  Association  of  Securities \nDealers in the United States. \n       \n  yield curve  \u2013  A line that plots the interest rates, at a set point in time, of \nbonds with equal credit quality but differing maturity dates. \nThe  most  frequently  reported  yield  curve  compares  the  \n3-month, 2-year, 5-year, and 30-year United States Treasury \ndebt. This yield curve is used as a benchmark for pricing all \nother debts in the market, such as mortgage rates or bank \nlending rates.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed policy-\nbased loan to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 2 of the Encouraging Investment \nthrough  Capital  Market  Reforms  Program.1 The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA) for Institutionalizing Capital Market Reforms, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The program supplements coordinated support provided by the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to accelerate investment by increasing the availability of long-term finance. The program \nwill  deepen  the  capital  market  through  a  series  of  sequenced  reforms  designed  to  \n(i) further develop the government bond market, (ii) encourage growth in domestic long-term \nsavings, and (iii) ease barriers to entry to diversify and broaden available funding sources. \nSubprogram  2  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  country  operations  business  plan,  2017\u20132019  for  the \nPhilippines.2 \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The programmatic approach and budget support. ADB\u2019s Board of Directors approved \nthe programmatic approach and loan for subprogram 1 on 26 November 2015. The program \nincluded two subprograms and focused on developing the domestic capital market to provide \nlong-term finance to support the government\u2019s infrastructure agenda. Utilizing strong diagnostics \nas  its  base,  the  programmatic  approach  initially  concentrated  on  improving  efficiencies, \nstrengthening  capacity,  and  providing  an  enabling  environment  for  the  more  complex  and \nsubstantive reforms to come. Subprogram 2 implements these initiatives, thus providing a more \nstable and reliable yield curve, increased long-term savings and finance, and a greater diversity \nof  participants  in  the  domestic  bond  market.  The  inclusion  of  a  post-program  partnership \nframework (P3F), 2017\u20132021 continues ADB\u2019s engagement utilizing TA (para. 24). By addressing \nlong-standing constraints in the wholesale finance market, ADB can now pivot its support toward \nincreasing financial inclusion with a focus on improving poor households\u2019 access to finance, \nfinancial literacy, and consumer protection. The use of a programmatic approach with a policy-\nbased loan and TA aligns ADB\u2019s support with the government\u2019s reform program while providing \nincentives and capacity to complete the reforms.  \n \n4.  The  development  problem.  The  Philippine  Development  Plan  (PDP),  2017\u20132022 \ncontinues the government\u2019s emphasis on inclusive growth. Under the PDP, the government has \nset a strategic target to reach upper-middle-income status by 2022.3 It has also targeted gross \ndomestic product (GDP) growth of 7%\u20138% per year, in real terms, with GDP per capita increasing \nfrom $3,550 in 2015 to $5,000 by 2022. In addition, the government has targeted a decline in the \nnational poverty rate from 21.6% in 2015 to 14.0% in 2022, and from 30% to 20% in rural areas \nover the same timeframe. To accomplish these goals, a primary emphasis has again been placed \non investment and infrastructure. However, the competitiveness of infrastructure in the Philippines \nstill ranks very low worldwide\u2014112th out of 138 in 2016\u20132017 compared to 98th out of 144 in \n2012\u20132013\u2014with inadequate infrastructure ranked as the second most problematic factor for \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2016. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n3  Government of the Philippines, National Economic and Development Authority. 2017. Philippine Development Plan, \n2017\u20132022. Manila. http://pdp.neda.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/PDP-2017-2022-04-24-2017.pdf. \n ", " \n2   \ndoing  business  in the country.4 To  address this  deficit,  the government  plans  to  increase \nexpenditure on infrastructure significantly relative to the previous PDP. Public spending on \ninfrastructure as a share of GDP is expected to increase from 5.1% in 2016 to 7.4% by 2022, or \napproximately  $14.5  billion  annually.  A  diversified  funding  mix  will  be  utilized,  including \ngovernment financing, private capital, and official development assistance.5  \n \n5.  To achieve these goals, the financial sector must now absorb higher levels of long-tenor \ngovernment debt and private sector debt capital without generating a significant increase in \nborrowing costs. In particular, the government recognizes the need to channel more private \nsavings  into  bankable  infrastructure  investments  through  the  domestic  financial  markets.6 \nHowever, the capacity of the domestic financial market remains limited. The size of the Philippine \nbond market as a share of GDP remains small, at 27% relative to the average of 68% in emerging \nEast Asia. The government bond market itself is underdeveloped and exhibits low liquidity, which \nreduces its attractiveness. Bid\u2013offer spreads average 4.6 basis points, compared to the emerging \nEast Asia average of 3.8 basis points. The nonbank finance sector represents an alternative \nsource of private capital for infrastructure. Outstanding corporate bonds have reached an all-time \nhigh of 6.2% of GDP. The lapse of an exemption to the banking sector\u2019s single-borrower limit for \ninfrastructure at the end of 2016 has intensified interest in the capital market. Nevertheless, more \nneeds to be done, as the size of the corporate bond market lags well behind regional averages. \nInsurance premiums are approaching 2% of GDP but are still less than half the level in more \nadvanced markets such as Thailand (5.53%), Malaysia (4.30%), and Singapore (6.06%).  \n \n6.  Binding constraints. The government recognizes the challenges it faces in improving \nfinancial intermediation in the economy, including the need to (i) strengthen the management of \ntreasury  operations  and  ensure  increased  participation  in  government  bond  auctions,  \n(ii) encourage the development of long-term contractual savings and investment products to \nchannel funds to infrastructure, and (iii) diversify the investor base in terms of participants and \nbusiness models (paras. 7\u20139). \n \n7.  Increasing expectations for the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) to fund infrastructure with \ngovernment debt directly will be difficult to meet in the longer term. There are two primary \nconstraints. First, the BTr has not yet institutionalized reforms to strengthen cash, investment, \nand risk management. Thus, a compensating bond sinking fund, consisting of government \nsecurities and liquid assets (see glossary), is still being maintained to ensure cash is adequate to \nmeet maturing obligations. While the fund\u2019s balance has declined, total holdings still exceed P700 \nbillion and financing costs exceed revenue (negative carry) by approximately P17 billion per year. \nSupporting financial infrastructure must be modernized and inefficiencies arising from the bond \nsinking fund must be addressed. Second, the government must ensure significant and sustained \nparticipation in primary government bond auctions. The current Government Eligible Securities \nDealers  (GSED)  system  does  not  impose  responsibilities  and  provides  few  incentives  to \nparticipate. Efforts to defragment the government bond market by building a limited number of \ndeep and liquid issues must continue, which will improve liquidity and increase the reliability of \nthe yield curve as a price-setting tool. Dealers must be also provided with the tools to manage \nrisks arising from market making. \n \n                                                \n4  World Economic Forum. 2012. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2012\u20132013. Geneva; World Economic Forum. \n2016. The Global Competitiveness Report, 2016\u20132017. Geneva. \n5  Under the PDP, the national budget devoted to infrastructure expenditure is expected to increase from 3.5% to 5.7% \nof GDP by 2022, and resulting GDP growth is estimated to be 1.5\u20137.0 percentage points higher. \n6  An ADB staff \u201chigh-side\u201d estimate indicates that untapped private capital could be sufficient to meet 4\u20135 years of \ninfrastructure expenditure at an annual rate of 6% of GDP. \n ", " \n3 \n8.  Legislative changes, financial infrastructure upgrades, and reduced friction costs have \nincreased the availability of both long-term savings and finance. Nevertheless, development \nconstraints remain. First, the government has not yet provided detailed implementation guidelines \nto support recent legislative initiatives (e.g., the revised insurance code and the law establishing \nthe Personal Equity Retirement Account [PERA]). New products and services, while authorized, \nhave not yet been provided with an enabling environment (e.g., repurchase agreements and \nproject bonds). For example, the contractual savings sector exhibits elevated risk due to a \nsignificant mismatch between the duration of its liabilities and the far shorter duration of its assets. \nProviding incentives to close this mismatch will both reduce risk and increase the sector\u2019s appetite \nfor long-term financial instruments, such as infrastructure bonds. Recent efforts to launch a tax-\ndeferred long-term retirement savings account must be completed, and initiatives to authorize \nadditional modalities of long-term finance must continue. Second, legal, operational, and cost \ndistortions  restrain  the  development  of  the  nonbank  finance  sector  and  inhibit  innovation. \nForemost,  taxation  across  subsectors  has  not  been  harmonized,  regulatory  constraints \ndiscourage alternative trading strategies, and associated costs are high.  \n \n9.  The finance sector is not adequately diversified. More needs to be done to encourage the \nentry of foreign financial institutions to stimulate additional demand for the increased issuance of \nlocal currency long-term debt. In addition, foreign financial institutions can (i) introduce different \nbusiness models, which rely more heavily on investment banking as opposed to interest income; \n(ii) accelerate knowledge transfer (such as project finance); and (iii) provide counterparties for \nhedging  transactions.  Moreover,  the  government  should  strengthen  governance  within  the \nfinancial markets to ensure competitive parity and guard against excesses, which often arise in \nhigh-growth scenarios coupled with increased debt issuance.  \n \n10.  The government\u2019s reform agenda. Under the PDP, the government plans to increase \npublic spending on infrastructure to as high as 7.4% of GDP by 2022 (para. 4). To finance this \nincrease, the government will (i) increase public spending, (ii) promote public\u2013private partnerships \n(PPPs), and (iii) develop the capital market to provide long-term finance. The government will also \nmanage the debt portfolio and borrowing mix program proactively to increase fiscal space. To \ndevelop the capital market, the central bank will refine its interest rate corridor mechanism to align \nmarket and policy rates, establishing a foundation for the short end of the yield curve. The \ngovernment will also implement an issuance program to maintain liquid benchmark securities, \nthereby establishing a reliable domestic yield curve. Complimentary reforms will strengthen the \nGovernment Securities Eligible Dealer (GSED) system to establish a market-making function to \nboost trading activity and liquidity. A repurchase agreement (\u201crepo\u201d) for domestic securities will \nbe launched, and upgrades to the financial market infrastructure will promote efficiency in the \ntrading and settlement of securities. \n \n11.  ADB experience. ADB has supported finance sector reforms with five programmatic-\napproach, policy-based loans and substantial TA (Figure 1). ADB initially focused on the equity \nmarket and encouraged consolidation, self-regulation, and enhanced transparency. Responding \nto the 1997 financial crisis, ADB supported the government\u2019s efforts to strengthen governance, \nimprove the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), implement investor protections, and \ndevelop an anti-money laundering function. Beginning in 2005, ADB launched an effort to support \ndevelopment of the fixed income market but these efforts were overtaken by the 2008 global \nfinancial crisis which necessitated a revised focus on financial stability. Nevertheless, reforms \nharmonized reporting and disclosure practices with international standards, improved settlement \nand payment systems, and strengthened regulatory capabilities. Based on lessons learned (para. \n12), ADB has instituted a highly coordinated approach to guide its programmatic support. This \nprogram has re-emphasized the fundamentals of capital market development beginning with the \n ", " \n4   \nmoney and government debt markets. Concurrent with these efforts, ADB will continue to support \nthe issuance of local currency project bonds. Recognizing that inclusive finance and finance \n \nsector development are mutually reinforcing, ADB will also launch a dedicated financial inclusion \nprogram in 2018 to supplement ADB's PPP and youth employment programs. 7 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n12.  Lessons  learned.  ADB\u2019s  long-term  engagement  helped  inform  the  program  by \nhighlighting key lessons learned. First, success in developing a local currency bond market \ndepends on several factors, including (i) sound macroeconomic policies (e.g., a market-based \nmonetary framework) and debt management strategies; (ii) a diversified investor base; (iii) a \nsound legal framework; and (iv) modern, reliable, and efficient infrastructure.8 Seen through this \nframework,  the  credit  rating  upgrades  and  the  recent  launch  of  an  interest  rate  corridor \nmechanism by the central bank have together provided a strong foundation for developing the \ndomestic capital market. Second, finance sector reforms are complex, have a medium- to long-\nterm gestation period, and require proper sequencing.9 In retrospect, ADB\u2019s early engagement in \nthe equity market delayed reforms to the fixed-income market that would have integrated and \nmodernized the market in step with the wider financial market and international standards. Third, \nprograms should exhibit sufficient flexibility to accommodate a medium- to long-term development \nhorizon and changes in the addenda of reform champions. Fourth, capital market development is \na prerequisite for expanding the financial inclusion of poor households beyond microcredit. As \nempirical evidence shows that financial exclusion of the poor contributes to persistently high \nincome inequality, ADB\u2019s assistance will increasingly focus on financial inclusion.  \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s value addition to program design and implementation. ADB\u2019s TA support to \nsubprogram 2 has produced impressive results. To institutionalize reforms under subprogram 1, \nthe  BTr  has reconstituted  divisions  covering  cash,  investment,  and risk management.

Continuing efforts to scale back the size of \nthe bond sinking fund, which ADB also supported under subprogram 1, and are now estimated to \nproduce P5 billion\u2013P7 billion in annual fiscal savings over the life of the reforms. ADB also \nprovided direct support to upgrade the BTr\u2019s infrastructure, including its registry of scripless \nsecurities. This is the first upgrade in over 20 years and will significantly modernize finance sector \ninfrastructure in the Philippines.10 In addition, ADB TA supported the adoption of risk-based \ncapital by the insurance sector, providing a direct incentive for the purchase of four infrastructure \nbonds under subprogram 2.11 ADB provided the infrastructure to launch the PERA, and is \nsupporting the government\u2019s efforts to reform the tax regime, including those applied to the \nfinance sector.12 Finally, ADB supported the SEC\u2019s efforts to implement the corporate governance \nroad map, and to strengthen the definition of an independent director.13 \n \n14.  Development partner coordination. The government\u2019s capital market reform agenda \nhas strong development partner coordination.14 The Government of Australia supported the \n \nPhilippines\u2013Australia Public Financial Management Program, which launched the treasury single \naccount. ADB, the United States Treasury, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are \ncurrently facilitating an initiative to develop the Philippines\u2019 first government-led capital market \ndevelopment strategy. Otherwise, the existing donor demarcation remains. The United States \nTreasury  is  providing  resident  advisors  to  strengthen  the  GSED  system  and  develop  an \ninfrastructure bond market. ADB is providing support to modernize infrastructure, strengthen cash \nmanagement,  introduce  a  repurchase market, and  develop  capacity.  The IMF  is  providing \nintermittent follow-up support and advice to strengthen the conduct of monetary policy.  \n \n15.  Economic impact of the program. The program has several important impacts. First, \nthe BTr\u2019s more efficient management of liquid assets has yielded additional fiscal savings over \nsubprogram 1. Second, reforms to treasury operations and the government bond market are \nexpected to not only deepen the bond market but also produce efficiencies that will lower the \noverall cost of capital in the Philippines. Third, liberalized foreign entry into the banking system is \nexpected to produce efficiencies and more competitive pricing (para. 28). \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The program\u2019s impact is meeting the government\u2019s targeted investment rate. The outcome \nwill be a deeper nonbank finance sector developed. At the program\u2019s inception in 2015, the \ngovernment agreed to accomplish nine prior expected actions and 13 policy milestones as the \nbasis for subprogram 2.15 All nine policy triggers have been fully accomplished. During the \nprocessing of subprogram 2, a new prior action reflecting the government\u2019s commitment to \nliberalize foreign entry to the finance sector was added. Two policy milestones related to the \ndevelopment of unregistered bonds and the ongoing effort to harmonize finance sector taxes were \nshifted to the post-program partnership framework (P3F) at the government\u2019s request. Two \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Philippines for Strengthening Treasury\u2019s Liquidity    \nManagement.

The changes in the policy \nmatrix and DMF are reflected in the revised design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).16 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n17.  Output  1:  Liquidity  in  the  government  bond  market  enhanced.  This  output  will \nincrease efficiencies to provide additional direct funding for infrastructure, and will provide a \nfoundation for developing the government bond market, itself a foundation of wider capital market \ndevelopment.  Accomplishments  under  subprogram  2  include  the  following:  the  BTr \ninstitutionalized  improvements  in  cash  management  achieved  under  subprogram  1  by \nreconstituting a cash management committee and implementing enhanced reporting, formal \npolicies and targets, and a standardized reporting template. The BTr also reconstituted a formal \ninvestment management process to improve the returns on its invested cash balances. Like the \ncash management committee, the investment management committee is now supported by a \ndedicated staff, operations manuals, performance targets, risk limits, and a standardized reporting \nprotocol.  Finally, the BTr further reduced the negative cost of carry associated with the bond \nsinking fund by reducing the fund\u2019s size to cover only 2 years of debt service, as opposed to the \noriginal  20%  of  all  outstanding  debt.  All  together,  these  reforms  achieved  or  preserved \napproximately P5 billion\u2013P7 billion in annual fiscal savings over the life of the reforms. \n \n18.  The rapid growth of the corporate bond market over the past 3 years is encouraging. \nHowever, much more needs to be done to develop the local currency government bond market \nto reduce the economy\u2019s dependence of bank-dominated financing and to match long-term \nfinance with long-term funding. To support increased debt issuance, and to provide a term \nstructure  of  interest  rates, the government  launched  an  initiative  to  ensure significant  and \nconsistent participation in primary auctions. An evaluation system will rank the participating \nGSED\u2019s  (primary  dealers)  based  on  participation  and  activity  levels.  The  BTr  designed  a  \n\u201ctop-ranked dealer\u201d program, which will include responsibilities and, more importantly, incentives, \nincluding exclusive market feedback discussions with the BTr and a government securities \nlending program. Moreover, the BTr continued to defragment the government securities market, \nand increase its liquidity by reducing the number of outstanding issues to 85 from 118 at the end \nof subprogram 1 and 204 at the inception of the program. To improve liquidity in the government \nbond market further, support market making, and encourage alternative trading strategies, the \nMoney Market Association of the Philippines has formally applied to the SEC to establish a  \nself-regulatory organization to govern the repurchase market.  \n \n19.  To modernize its operations, the BTr institutionalized risk management by operationalizing \nfour previously authorized divisions (e.g., the risk management, fund management, capital market \nstrategy and planning, and debt strategy and planning divisions).  Operations manuals, risk limits \nand structures, and exception reporting have been completed and implemented. In addition, \ninternal treasury risk management systems and the registry of scripless securities were replaced \nwith modern, off-the-shelf vendor products, representing the first such upgrade in approximately \n20 years. The risk management system will facilitate the establishment and monitoring of fiscal \nrisk limits. The new scripless registry will eliminate redundancies and foster greater efficiencies in \nthe trading and settlement of securities, and will also lead to the more effective implementation of \nprior reforms such as trading across the tax and tax-exempt sectors. \n                                                \n16 Summary Assessment of Policy Actions under Subprogram 2 (accessible from the list of linked documents in \nAppendix 13). \n ", " \n7 \n20.  Output 2: Long-term savings and investment products encouraged. This output will \nincrease the supply and demand of long-term investment products. Accomplishments under \nsubprogram 2 include the following. The Insurance Commission has encouraged insurance \ncompanies to consolidate through increased capital standards, which will strengthen the sector\u2019s \nfinancial footing and create economies of scale. The Insurance Commission has also adopted \nrisk-based capital to provide economic incentives to the insurance sector to hold long-duration \nassets to match their long-duration liabilities. Moreover, the Insurance Commission has begun \nauthorizing insurance companies to purchase infrastructure bonds and PPP-related debt under \nthe revised Insurance Code (a reform under subprogram 1.) To date, insurance companies have \nbeen authorized to purchase debt issued by two separate projects supporting the construction of \nschools (PPP) and a power plant. The government launched the PERA to the public, and the SEC \nfacilitated the introduction of additional fundraising channels by approving the listing rules for PPP \ncompanies of the Philippine Stock Exchange.  \n \n21.  At the same time, the government has moved to reduce costs and improve the legal \nframework. The SEC submitted for congressional approval the revised Corporation Code, which \nincludes provisions to provide corporations with perpetual existence and enable the creation of \n\u201cone-person\u201d corporations to extend the benefits and protections of the corporate legal structure \nto  small  businesses.  To  accommodate  foreign  strategic  investors,  the  revised  code  has \nauthorized board participation via remote access, and poll voting will be mandated at the request \nof shareholders. The legislation also strengthens protections against anticompetitive behavior, \nand allows the SEC to order the dissolution of any corporation found to be engaged in fraudulent \npractices, tax evasion, or corruption. The proposed code also authorizes the SEC to retain fees, \nfines, and other charges to fund modernization efforts and attract highly skilled technical staff by \nincreasing staff salaries to mirror the private sector more closely.    \n \n22.  Output  3:  Market  depth  and  diversity  increased.  This  output  will  encourage  the \nintroduction of varied business models and products by liberalizing entry to the finance sector and \nstrengthening  its governance.  Accomplishments  under subprogram  2 include  the following. \nSupported by legal reforms enacted under subprogram 1, the government has authorized foreign \nfinancial institutions (nine banks and one insurance company) to establish domestic subsidiaries \nin the Philippines.  Unlike previously authorized branches, these banks will enjoy full access to \nthe domestic market and can establish branches at will. The government also strengthened \ncorporate governance by adopting a blueprint covering 2016\u20132020 that formally confirms the \ngovernment\u2019s intent to adopt global corporate governance practices. The blueprint identifies gaps, \ncommunicates ongoing corrective measures, and establishes a phased implementation schedule. \nThe blueprint also incorporates the recommendations of the Asian Roundtable 2003 White Paper \non Corporate Governance which cover increased awareness, active enforcement, improved \ndisclosures, capacity development, and protections for minority shareholders.17   \n \n23.  Under the blueprint, the SEC promulgated a new Code of Corporate Governance based \non  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and  Development\u2019s  principles.  The  code \nincorporates  the  concepts  of  \u201ccomply  or  explain\u201d  and  proportionality,  and  covers  board \nresponsibility, transparency, internal controls, relationships, and duties to shareholders. The code \nalso requires the following four committees: audit, corporate governance, risk oversight, and \nrelated party transactions. At least three directors must be independent. Independent directors \nare now limited to a maximum cumulative term of 9 years and can hold no more than five outside \ndirectorships. This change brings the Philippines in line with regional peers such as Malaysia and \nSingapore. By 2015, one quarter of the 609 independent directors of publicly listed companies in \n                                                \n17 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2003. White Paper on Corporate Governance. Paris.  \n ", " \n8   \nthe Philippines had served more than 10 years, and 18 had served for 20 years consecutively. \nThe government also identified specific revisions to the Securities Regulation Code needed to \nenable  the  government  to  join  the  International  Organization  of  Securities  Commissions\u2019 \nmultilateral memorandum of understanding (MMOU). These changes include granting the SEC \nsubpoena powers, and the power to respond directly to requests for information. \n \n24.  Post-program  partnership  framework.  While  nonbinding,  the  P3F  provides  for  a \nstructured dialogue over the medium term between ADB and the government, as well as a \nframework for continuing TA support. Under this framework, ADB will support the government\u2019s \nefforts to develop a capital market blueprint and to provide an enabling environment. The BTr will \nassume greater administrative control over the wholesale government bond market, improve its \noperations, and strengthen risk management. The \u201ctop-ranked dealer\u201d program will be formalized \nand the development of a working repurchase market is anticipated within this timeframe. The \nSEC will continue pursuing legislative and regulatory changes, including amendments to the \nSecurities Regulation Code and the possible adoption of a collective investment schemes law. \nThe government will remove tax distortions that favor bank lending over capital markets, introduce \nadditional long-term financing instruments, and launch the PERA to the wider market. Finally, the \ngovernment will process revisions to the legal framework to join the International Organization of \nSecurities  Commissions\u2019  MMOU.  Participation  in  the  MMOU  will  increase  cross-border \ninvestments and strengthen the quality of capital market supervision. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n25.  The government has requested a regular loan of $300 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the program. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a 3-year grace \nperiod, annuity method with 30% discount, an annual interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement (the \naverage maturity is 12.1 years). The loan will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2015, as amended from time to time). The loan size is based on the \nPhilippines\u2019  financing  needs,  the  development  impact  of  the  policy  reform  package,  and \ndevelopment spending arising from the reform. In 2017, the government\u2019s total gross borrowing \nrequirement is estimated at $12.6 billion, a fifth of which will be from foreign borrowing. The foreign \nborrowing will comprise government bonds estimated at $477.1 million, and official development \nassistance in the form of program loans estimated at $1.40 billion. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  The Department of Finance (DOF) is the executing agency, and the BTr and SEC are the \nimplementing  agencies.  The  implementation  period  is  July  2015\u2013June  2017.  A  steering \ncommittee chaired by the DOF with the implementing agencies as members will oversee the \nprogram\u2019s implementation.18 The steering committee will meet semiannually and, if needed, on \nan ad hoc basis to monitor the continuing implementation of reforms under the P3F.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n27.      The government asked ADB to provide transaction TA to support reforms specified under \nthe program\u2019s P3F. The TA will have the same impact and outcome, and will contain two outputs. \nThe first will prepare the government\u2019s first detailed implementation plan covering 2017\u20132022 to \n                                                \n18 The Insurance Commission and the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will be committee members, reflecting ADB\u2019s \nongoing TA to each and the role of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas in supporting financial inclusion and literacy. \n ", " \n9 \nguide the stakeholders\u2019 reform priorities, and the second will provide support to complete specific \nkey technical reforms called for in the P3F and necessary to develop a well-functioning domestic \ncurrency bond market. The BTr will be the executing agency, and the BTr and SEC will be the \nimplementing agencies. The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The TA will \nbe implemented from November 2017 to November 2020, and will include a total of 20 person-\nmonths  of  consulting  services.  ADB  will  engage  the  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB \nProcurement Policy and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017).19 \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n28.  A growing body of empirical research produces a remarkably consistent narrative, namely, \nthat finance sector development exerts a first-order impact on long-run economic growth.20 On a \nproject-specific level, the program generates recurrent quantifiable benefits with a net present \nvalue of $437 million, supplementing the $1.2 billion in net benefits achieved under subprogram \n1. These benefits reflect the continuity of reforms through the programmatic approach, but still far \nexceed the program\u2019s estimated costs. The present value of gross benefits is $653 million accrued \nprimarily  from  enhancements  to  the  primary  and  secondary  government  bond  markets.  In \naddition, foreign entry into the banking sector is expected to produce significant efficiencies \nthrough increased competition, more competitive pricing, and a wider array of business models. \nThe present value of costs is approximately $216 million, representing forgone tax revenue, an \nincrease in the SEC\u2019s budget, and administrative and compliance expenses.21 \n \nB.  Governance \n \n29.  The government continues to strengthen its public financial management (PFM). The 2017 \nPublic Expenditure and Financial Accountability assessment confirmed that three of the seven \ncore  areas  (transparency,  policy-based  budgeting,  and  asset-liability  management)  have \nimproved and are now considered strong.22 Areas of weakness identified in the assessment\u2014\nbudget credibility, predictability and control in budget execution, and external scrutiny and audit\u2014\nare being actively addressed. Moreover, the proposed Public Financial Accountability Act will help \nto enforce accountability in PFM by strengthening congressional control and oversight, requiring \nan  integrated  PFM  system,  and  increasing  budget  transparency  and  participation.  The \ngovernment continues to pursue a comprehensive, results-based anticorruption plan, and to \nincrease the capacity of the Office of the Ombudsman and the justice sector. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption \nPolicy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the government. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n30.  Finance sector development helps reduce poverty through at least three channels: higher \neconomic  growth,  finance  sector  inclusiveness,  and  finance  sector  stability.  The  program \ncontributes to poverty reduction by increasing fiscal space for social expenditures, and by \nencouraging the provision of long-term, peso-denominated financing to support infrastructure \ndevelopment. Increased infrastructure investment will lead to increased employment and, in turn, \n                                                \n19  Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20  Ross Levine, Sara Zervos, The American Economic Review, Volume 88, No. 3 (June 1998) pp. 637-558, and  \n Marco Arena 2008.

While the program does not focus directly on financial \ninclusion, reforms to encourage retirement savings and policy improvements in the insurance \nsector provide an entry point for ADB\u2019s planned future engagement in this area.23 \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n31.  The program will not entail any involuntary resettlement or affect indigenous people or the \nenvironment. It is classified as category C for all safeguards categories (involuntary resettlement, \nimpact on indigenous people, and environmental impact).  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n32.  The program has four substantial risks.24 National risks include weaknesses in the PFM \nsystem and corruption. To mitigate these risks, the government, with the support of ADB and \nother development partners in the Philippines Development Forum, has strengthened the budget \nreview process, reduced the number and size of special purpose funds, and mandated increased \ntransparency as a precondition to accessing public funds. To reduce corruption risks, the Good \nGovernance  and  Anti-Corruption  Cabinet  Cluster  of  the  Philippines  implemented  a \ncomprehensive and results-based anticorruption action plan. In terms of contextual risks, an \ninadequate budget to upgrade financial infrastructure and strengthen regulatory capabilities is a \nsubstantial risk. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) integration efforts might \nbe disrupted by uneven reform progress across ASEAN member states. Mitigation measures \nhave been adopted and the government has shown commitment to ASEAN integration through \nthe liberalization of foreign entry into the financial services.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n33.  The government and the DOF have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n34.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \nloan of $300,000,000 to the Republic of the Philippines for subprogram 2 of the Encouraging \nInvestment through Capital Market Reforms Program, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in \nregular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; \nand such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the \ndraft loan agreement presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident     \n \n31 October 2017    \n                                                \n23  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1     11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nImpact the program is aligned with: The Government of the Philippines\u2019 targeted investment rate achieved. \n(Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u20132022)a \nResults  Performance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nChain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2018:     \nA deeper  a.
