INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the Government \nof Mongolia strengthen agriculture value chains and promote sustainable and efficient agriculture \nproduction. The TA will improve the capacity and ability of herder cooperatives to address issues \nincluding livestock, pasture, and water management and strengthen value chains and links with \nmarkets.  The  TA-generated  knowledge  will  also  provide  an  evidence-based  model  for \nempowering herder cooperatives and allow Mongolia to transition towards sustainable and \nquality-based livestock production.  \n \n2.  The  government  requested  the  TA  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \nCooperative-Based  Sustainable  Agriculture  Production  to  prioritize  quality-based  livestock \nproduction over quantity-based output.1 The TA is included in the country operations business \nplan for Mongolia, 2020\u20132021.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Agriculture  remains  a  key  source  of  poverty  reduction  and  employment  in  Mongolia, \nemploying one third of Mongolia\u2019s economically active population and contributing just over 12% of \ngross domestic product. Livestock contributes 84% of agriculture output, and an estimated 230,000 \nherder households rely on livestock for income and livelihood. Despite the importance of agriculture \nand livestock to poor rural households, many herders continue to manage livestock and pasture \nprivately without adequate regulations, policies, and incentives for sustainable livestock, pasture, \nand water management, which has impaired the development of more climate-resilient and profitable \nlivestock production and marketing systems in Mongolia. As a result, over 70% of Mongolia\u2019s \npastureland is now degraded and livestock heads exceed 66 million.  Well-functioning herder \ncooperatives could offer several services to members beyond just buying and selling livestock, \nincluding marketing, production, insurance and financial services, access to training, agriculture \ntechnology and extension services, and arrangements for collective and sustainable livestock, \npasture, and water management.   \n \n4.  While the number of pasture user groups and herder cooperatives has grown in recent years, \nseveral challenges constrain the ability of herder cooperatives to lift herder incomes, promote \nsustainable livestock production, and boost Mongolian meat exports. First, the structure, function, \nand role of herder cooperatives remains somewhat unclear, particularly after Mongolia traded \nsocialism for capitalism in 1992, disbanding state-run herder collectives, privatizing livestock, and \nderegulating public pastureland.3 In addition, many cooperatives have yet to establish reliable links \nwith veterinary services, agribusinesses, processors, and exporters, limiting their ability to access \nhigh value domestic and international markets for members. Finally, limited arrangements for \ncoordinated  grazing  management,  lack  of  trust  among  members,  and  insufficient  capital \naccumulation for operating and investment needs remain important issues for herder cooperatives.   \n \n5.  Cooperatives, herders, and government officials have limited knowledge and capacity. \nCooperatives lack the capacity to deliver improved services to herders for sustainable livestock \nand pasture management and animal health, nutrition, quality, and traceability. Although large \nherds give herders additional status and diversity of herds, they also contribute to overgrazing, \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 September 2019. \n2  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: Mongolia, 2020\u20132021. Manila. The TA is listed as \u201cAgriculture Master \nPlan\u201d in the country operations business plan. \n3  Earth Journalism Network. 2016. https://www.earthjournalism.net/stories/mongolian-herders-turn-to-soviet-past-to-\nadapt-to-climate-change.  \n ", "2 \ndesertification,  excessive  resource  use,  and  inadequate  animal  feed,  particularly  in  winter. \nMeanwhile, herders have limited knowledge about services, rights, entitlements, responsibilities, \nand profit-sharing mechanisms within herder cooperatives. To realize their potential, herder \ncooperatives must expand their knowledge. Additionally, it is important for national and local \ngovernment officials to (i) build capacity and awareness of the key challenges faced by herder \ncooperatives  and  (ii)  support  evidence-based  models  for  cooperatives  that  can  promote \nsustainable, quality-oriented, efficient, and climate-friendly livestock production.  \n \n6.  To diversify the economy and boost exports of livestock products, the government must \nreview existing policies and introduce new ones for meat exports, including through herder \ncooperatives. Limited institutional coordination and policy support for cooperative-driven and \nhigh- quality meat exports have kept export volumes of livestock products below their potential. \nPolicies and arrangements remain inadequate to ensure animal traceability, safety, and product \nquality required for exports. Animal diseases, including foot-and-mouth disease, are prevalent \nand persistent, and the veterinary system has been unable to promptly and effectively work with \nherder groups and cooperatives to contain and manage outbreaks.4 These animal disease \noutbreaks have led Mongolia\u2019s neighbors to periodically ban Mongolian meat exports.5 However, \nMongolia\u2019s proximity to major regional markets in Northeast and Central Asia, and its reputation \nfor pastoralist traditions, suggests the potential to significantly boost exports  and incomes, \nparticularly if cooperatives can strengthen food safety standards and product quality and diversity, \nand thereby help Mongolia integrate into regional and global value chains.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  competitiveness  and  sustainability  of \nMongolia\u2019s agriculture sector improved (Mongolia Sustainable Development Vision 2030).6 The \nTA will have the following outcome: sustainable, quality-based, and efficient livestock production \npolicies and action plans developed.7 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Because critical challenges face the livestock subsector as Mongolia looks to move \ntowards  climate-friendly,  sustainable,  and  quality-based  livestock  production  systems,  it  is \nessential  to  develop  new  knowledge,  technologies,  and  models  for  strengthening  and \nempowering herder cooperatives as one promising avenue for improving the sustainability and \ncompetitiveness of the livestock subsector. The proposed TA will comprise four outputs that will \ngenerate new knowledge and build capacity to adopt improved agriculture practices and policies.  \n \n9.  Output 1: Improved herder cooperative structures developed. The TA will identify the \nchallenges and constraints faced by herder cooperatives in coordinating grazing among herders; \naddress collective livestock, pasture, and water management issues to improve the quality of livestock \noutput  and  strengthen  market  linkages;  and  propose  recommendations  for  strengthening  and \nempowering herder cooperatives. It will investigate (i) issues internal to cooperatives, such as \ncooperative structure, self-sufficiency status, organization, management and marketing capacity, profit \n \n4  ADB. 2019.

Ulaanbaatar. \n7  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nmanagement and distribution, and public awareness initiatives, and (ii) cooperatives\u2019 links with \nveterinary services, agribusinesses, processors, and exporters. The TA will produce a research and \ndiagnostic  study  report  identifying  the  issues  and  actions  required  to  enhance  the  fiscal, \nadministrative, and organizational capacity of herder cooperatives so that they are self-sufficient \nand have the capacity to not only address collective livestock, pasture and water management \nissues, but also strengthen value chain linkages. \n \n10.  Output 2: Model structures and arrangements for herder cooperatives in selected \nsoums tested. Based on the findings and recommendations from output 1, the TA will test new \nmodels and arrangements for herder cooperatives and pilot practices such as (i) sorting livestock \ncommodities based on quality within a single location for supplying to manufacturers and producers; \n(ii)  supporting  cooperatives  in  signing  collective  livestock,  pasture,  and  water  management \nagreements with local soum governments; and (iii) exploring other initiatives for promoting animal \ntraceability, product quality, and livestock health. The models will also test the capacity of herder \ncooperatives to deliver a package of services, including storage, transportation, quality assurance, \nand marketing for herders. Successful models can help cooperatives better support herders to avoid \nmiddle-agents and capture greater profit margins for themselves and their families.   \n \n11.  Output 3: Capacity of herders and Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Light Industry \nstaff for sustainable livestock production and management improved. The TA will prepare \ntraining materials and deliver training and capacity building to herders and government staff on \nherder cooperatives and sustainable livestock production. Training will focus on quality-based \nproduction, sustainable livestock, pasture and water management, and minimal preventable \nwaste. It will also raise awareness of the value of cooperatives and their rights, entitlements, \nresponsibilities, and mechanisms for profit sharing and distribution. The knowledge generated \nthrough this TA will also help to enhance the capacity of staff at the Ministry of Food, Agriculture \nand Light Industry, improving their understanding of cooperative constraints, structures, and \nopportunities based on sound research and empirical evidence.  \n \n12.  Output 4: Meat export policies from the herder cooperatives perspective examined. \nThe TA will examine existing meat export policies as they relate to herder cooperatives, and how \npolicy support and arrangements for herder cooperatives can boost Mongolian exports of meat \nand livestock products. This will involve consultations with important sector stakeholders to review, \ndiscuss, and seek consensus on policy reform recommendations to be proposed to strengthen \nthe ability of herder cooperatives to link with key market agents, stabilize market supply, and \nupgrade the quality of Mongolia\u2019s livestock products. Importantly, all proposed policy reforms will \nbe  linked  with  ongoing  initiatives  to  modernize  sanitary  measures  to  support  meat  export \nexpansion.8   \n \n13.  Lessons learned. Previous projects indicated that involvement and inputs of senior \nnational and soum government officials, concerned government agencies, and local experts in \nTA deliverables including draft reports and review workshops are important in ensuring quality \noutputs that meet the needs of various stakeholders. For policy research, greater benefits stem \nfrom more strategically planned dissemination to enhance knowledge-sharing activities and \nshowcase the findings and recommendations under the TA, which may be relevant for other \ngeographic regions, aimags (provinces), and soums with similar challenges. ADB also recognizes \n \n8  ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance for Strengthening International Food Safety Standards in Agriculture Value Chains \nin Central Asia Regional Cooperation Countries.

Additionally, the \nTA will incorporate and draw lessons from previous projects and facilitate knowledge-sharing and \ncooperation with other ongoing projects working with herder cooperatives.10  \n \n14.  Strategic fit. The proposed TA is aligned with the government\u2019s strong commitment for \nsector reform based on its Law on Development Policy and Planning, 2015, the pasture protection \nlaw under consideration for parliamentary approval, and Sustainable Development Vision 2030 \n(footnote 6), which considers the agriculture and livestock sector a top priority; ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020; and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, which aims to promote \npoverty  reduction,  rural  development,  inclusive  growth,  and  sustainable  agriculture  practices, \nparticularly through the operational priority of promoting rural development and food security.11 \nAmong other objectives, the operational priority of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 seeks to improve market \nconnectivity and agricultural value chain linkages. The TA is also consistent with CAREC 2030 \nstrategy to promote regional trade in agriculture by aligning sanitary measures with international \nstandards and building capacity on product quality.12 Finally, given the growing interest in working \nwith agriculture and herder cooperatives to strengthen market linkages and promote sustainable \nagriculture, this TA will investigate the key issues affecting cooperatives and generate knowledge \nthat can be used to inform both ongoing and future projects in Mongolia.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2. \n \n16.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of remuneration and travel \nexpenses of counterpart staff; government data and studies for the TA consultants\u2019 use; meeting \nrooms, office facilities, and geographic information system maps; and other in-kind contributions. \nThe government has been informed that the approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will administer and coordinate the implementation of the TA through the East Asia \nDepartment and will work closely with counterparts. ADB will engage consultants and carry out \nprocurement following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its \nassociated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. The implementing agency \nwill (i) provide project management support and carry out day-to-day TA activities, such as \noverseeing the TA consultants\u2019 work; (ii) organize peer reviews and comments on consultants\u2019 \n \n9  ADB. 2019.
