INTRODUCTION \n1.  A social stock exchange (SSE), also known as a social investment exchange, is a \nmechanism for raising funds for social enterprises. Social enterprises are business ventures \nwith a social mission, generating environmental or social benefits, as well as financial returns. \nTheir distinguishing feature is their social purpose, for which profits are reinvested.1 An SSE \naims to link social enterprises seeking capital with investors looking for opportunities to generate \nboth financial and social returns on their investments.2 Some simply raise funds online for social \nenterprises, some feature a rigid vetting process that generates accredited enterprises, and \nsome  enable  over-the-counter  transactions.  Although  models  for  an  SSE  exist,  no  SSE \noperates in the Asia and Pacific region.  \n \n2.  The first operating model of an SSE was set up in June 2003 by Bolsa de Valores de \nS\u00e3o  Paulo  (BOVESPA),  the  Stock  Exchange  of  S\u00e3o  Paolo,  Brazil,  as  a  corporate  social \nresponsibility  program.  Other  platforms  bringing  together  investors  with  social  enterprises \ninclude  the  South  Africa  Social  Investment  Exchange;  the  Global  Exchange  for  Social \nInvestment, based in Germany the United Kingdom; and the United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP)-sponsored pilot South\u2013South Human Development Stock Exchange.3 The \nSingapore-based Impact Investment Exchange (IIX) aims to be the first SSE in the Asia and \nPacific region. In January 2010, the Rockefeller Foundation provided a $495,000 grant to IIX for \nit to carry out research and proof-of-concept analysis before its launch.   \n \n3.  This regional research and development technical assistance (TA) will support studies \nthat  promote  links  between  social  enterprises  and  impact  investors.  It  will  determine  the \nfeasibility of a pilot regional SSE or an SSE in a single country. The SSE would bring together \nsocial enterprises from developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) seeking capital, and impact investors seeking financial profits along with social benefits.4 \nIt would build on and complement efforts to link social enterprises and impact investors through \npolicy research and knowledge sharing. A fact-finding mission5 confirmed the impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference \nwith potential partners. Consultations with civil society organizations and social enterprises in \nthe  region  revealed  interest  in  the  proposed  project.  This  TA  report  defines  the  output, \nmethodology, and key activities of the project. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \n                                                 \n1  There is no single internationally accepted definition of social enterprises.  Harvard Business School defines them \nas enterprises that focus on the application of management skills to create social value, regardless of whether an \nenterprise is a for-profit business, a nonprofit organization, or a government entity.  The definition of the United \nKingdom Social Enterprise Coalition distinguishes between organizations based on ownership, i.e., employee-\nowned, cooperatives, or community organizations. The Social Enterprise Alliance defines a social enterprise as an \norganization whose revenue funds its social mission.  \n2  Impact investors aim to address social or environmental challenges while generating financial profit. Impact \ninvestments can include investments producing a return of principal capital, market-rate investments, and even \ninvestments that produce financial returns greater than market average.   \n3  The South\u2013South Human Development Stock Exchange solicits charity donations, at $25 per share, for projects \nposted on its website. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 June 2010. \n5  A fact-finding mission was undertaken in July 2009 to meet with representatives of IIX, the Rockefeller Foundation, \nthe Singapore Economic Development Board, and the Singapore Ministry of Finance on the TA's proposed \nactivities and outputs. \n ", "2   \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Some  social  enterprises  started  with  small  loans  from  microfinance  institutions  and \nprovide goods, services, employment, or other benefits for disadvantaged and poor people. \nPromising social enterprises, with the potential to scale up their activities and increase their \nsocial impact, have failed to do so because of insufficient access to capital.  While Asia and the \nPacific is home to several successful large social enterprises or nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs)  that  conduct  market-based  activities,  such  as  Grameen  Bank,  Bangladesh  Rural \nAdvancement Committee, and the Population and Community Development Association, most \nsocial enterprises are still small or medium-sized, with low capacity and limited access to capital. \n \n5.  A study6 by the Monitor Institute estimated that global resources for investments in social \nenterprises could reach $500 billion in the next 5\u201310 years, 1% of professionally managed \nglobal assets in 2008. The Ashoka Foundation, which supports social entrepreneurs, estimates \nthat the requirements of markets for social enterprises are considerable.7 The global low-income \nhealth  care  market  is  estimated  at  $158  billion;  the  global  low-income  housing  market  is \nestimated at $332 billion; and the global low-income food market is estimated at $2.90 trillion.  \n \n6.  BOVESPA's  SSE  has  demonstrated  how  such  a  platform  can  generate  private \nresources for social enterprises. Its private donors have contributed more than $5 million to \nphilanthropic enterprises. Within 1 year of the SSE's establishment, all listed projects received \nfunding.8 Financed activities included initiatives to help island dwellers prepare for rising sea \nlevels caused by climate change and to rescue slum children from drug gangs.  \n \n7.  Scaling up social enterprises in DMCs is difficult. The vast majority are too small or ill-\nequipped  to  be  listed  on  stock  exchanges  and  potential  investors  do  not  have  enough \ninformation  about  them  to  assess  their  potential  properly.  Countless  innovative  social \nenterprises make significant contributions to their communities, but receive little attention from \nfinancial institutions. Many innovative and profitable approaches have been tried in the region, \nbut their cumulative impact has been limited, partly because of a lack of capital and partly \nbecause of a lack of information. An SSE could help to link impact investors with the growing \nnumber of social enterprises in need of financing. \n \n8.  ADB supports the development of capital markets in DMCs to facilitate and mobilize \ncapital for productive sectors of the economy. A major focus of ADB's assistance is regulatory \nreform. In Indonesia, for example, ADB supports a capital market development program9 to \nimprove information disclosure and enhance market surveillance to protect investors.  ADB \nhelps financial intermediaries to support underserved segments of the economy, such as small \nand medium-sized enterprises, housing finance, and micro enterprises (the same segments that \nare served by social enterprises). In India, ADB is supporting a program that contributes to the \n                                                 \n6  Monitor Institute. 2009.

Testing and launching a regional SSE or similar platform will require an appropriate \nfinancial infrastructure and regulatory framework, capacity-building support, networking activities, \nand  a  regional  focus.  ADB  can  help  build  support  for  such  a  facility  through  research, \nnetworking, and knowledge-sharing activities.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n10.  This TA will catalyze efforts currently underway in Asia and the Pacific to bring social \nenterprises together with impact investors through a stock exchange or similar platform.  Such a \nmechanism would mobilize the region's private financial resources for social enterprises in \nDMCs. The growth and impact of social enterprises would promote financial sector development \nand inclusive growth. An SSE or similar platform would enable enterprises o raise capital \nthrough shares and bonds, while connecting them to investors willing to purchase or trade their \nshares or bonds.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  TA  will  promote  inclusive  growth  by  providing  goods,  services,  and  livelihood \nopportunities to poor and disadvantaged people. The outcomes will be enhanced awareness \nand development of the region's social enterprise sector and more services mediating between \nsocial enterprises and potential investors.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will support research on the size of the market and the readiness of social \nenterprises in selected DMCs,11 as well as on the interest of potential impact investors. The \nresearch will focus on DMCs with a history of social enterprises and civil society organizations. \nThe  list  of  DMCs  will  be  confirmed  during  the  initial  stages  of  implementation  in  close \ncollaboration with ADB's regional departments. A study to assess the readiness and interest of \nmarket intermediaries and facilitators will be undertaken. Impact investment forums and other \nknowledge-sharing activities organized under the TA will generate support for the SSE. \n \n13.  Output 1: social enterprise market size and readiness. The TA will support research \non the potential market size and readiness of social enterprises for investments in at least three \nDMCs that have shown promise in social enterprise development. Case studies will illustrate \nsuccesses and failures of social enterprises. The research will indicate areas of operation, \npotential for scaling up, and the extent of the underserved market. The readiness of social \nenterprises to meet typical investment criteria, such as corporate governance, accounting and \nauditing  standards,  and  financial  performance  benchmarks,  will  also  be  investigated.  The \nresearch  will  produce  a  social  enterprise  profile  for  each  country  that  identifies:  (i)  those \nenterprises that are ready to absorb capital and have a high likelihood of achieving a listing on \nan  exchange;  and  (ii)  key  indicators  of  an  enterprise's  readiness  to  list  (including  capital, \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2010.

Manila (Loan 2617-IND).   \n11 These may include Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. No work will be undertaken until \n\"no objection\" letters have been secured from DMC governments. The participating DMCs will be confirmed during \nTA implementation. \n ", "4   \nfinancial transparency, sound governance, a business model, a plan for use of capital, and \nmanagement  commitment  to  double  bottom  line  of  socially  responsible  investments  and \norganizational gaps.  The research will also recommend policy and legal frameworks for social \nenterprise sustainability. It will assess regulatory frameworks and policies and study whether \nthey act as barriers or inhibit the formation of social enterprises and their ability to grow and \nattract capital.   \n \n14.  Output 2: impact investment profile. The TA will prepare a profile of impact investors \nwho may be willing to invest in social enterprises in the region, including their needs and \ninterests. It will estimate the scale of investments available. It will identify indicators that can be \nused to guide investors in choosing enterprises to support, such as their social return on \ninvestment. The research will focus on two groups of investors: those who may use an SSE or \nsimilar platform as a means to exit investments in social enterprises (e.g., social venture capital \nfunds), and those who may use an SSE or similar platform as a means to enter investments. \nFor investors exiting investments, the TA will seek to determine the degree to which they view \nan SSE or similar platform as a viable and desirable exit option and how an SSE can be made \nattractive to such investors. Investors entering investments include foundations, endowments, \npublic  pension  funds,  sovereign  wealth  funds,  and  high-net-worth  individuals  and  fund \nmanagers. \n \n15.  Output 3: intermediation research. The TA will support research through interviews, \nsurveys, and forums to assess the interest of market intermediaries and facilitators in an SSE or \nsimilar platforms. These include financial advisors, rating agencies, brokers, law firms, and \nresearch organizations. The experience of exchanges and intermediaries in other parts of the \nworld will be also reviewed and integrated into the learning products produced by the TA. \n \n16.  Output  4:  forums  and  awareness-raising  activities.  In  collaboration  with  IIX, \ninvestment forums will be held to bring together investors and social enterprises, and to share \ninformation about opportunities presented by the SSE concept. At least one regional workshop \namong stakeholders (e.g., regulatory bodies, government agencies, stock exchange officials, \ninvestors, and social enterprises) will be supported. The TA will support the production of a \ncommunications plan to disseminate knowledge and boost awareness of the SSE concept in the \ntargeted DMCs.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration  Financing  Partnership  Facility.12 The  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix  2.  IIX  and  the  Rockefeller  Foundation  will  provide  complementary  and  parallel \nfinancing for investment forums and regulatory framework studies. This complementary and \nparallel financing will not be administered by ADB. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, which will be managed by the Poverty \nReduction, Gender, and Social Development Division, Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment, in close collaboration with ADB Capital Markets and Financial Sectors Division, \nPrivate  Sector  Operations  Department.  Regional  department  divisions  promoting  financial \n                                                 \n12 Established by the Government of Japan and administered by ADB. \n ", "  5\nmarket development and the Office of Regional and Economic Integration will also be consulted \nregularly. A Poverty Reduction, Gender, and Social Development Division team, including two \nprofessional  members  of  staff,  one  national  officer,  and  three  operations  assistants,  will \ncoordinate and manage the consultants\u2019 activities and consolidate their outputs. The project will \nbe carried out over 24 months, from June 2010 to May 2012.  \n \n19.  The TA will require a total of 26 person-months of consulting services. For output 1, an \ninternational consultant (5 person-months, intermittent) and three national consultants (total of \n12 person-months, intermittent) will be engaged individually.  If the TA is unsuccessful in hiring \nindividuals, and the firm undertaking outputs 2 and 3 is qualified and willing, it will be engaged \nunder single source selection. The international consultant will have extensive expertise in \nsocial enterprises and impact investments in the region. The three national consultants (based \nin DMCs) will have expertise in research and in operations of social enterprises in the DMC \nwhere research is to be undertaken.   \n \n20.  Outputs 2 and 3 (estimated contract value of less than $50,000) will be generated under \na single package to be managed by a partner research NGO\u2014Impact Investment Shujog \nLimited, a Singapore-registered NGO, which is uniquely placed as a pioneer in promoting the \nSSE  concept  in  the  region.  Shujog's  staff  includes  individuals  with  knowledge  of  social \nenterprises, and social investing. It has engaged several social entrepreneurs and investment \nmanagers who are experienced in both impact investment and social enterprises internationally. \nShujog will be engaged for 3 months. Because of the ground-breaking nature of the assignment \nand the unique position of Shujog single source selection will be used for the package.  \n \n21.  For output 4, the services of a national consultant (6 person-months, intermittent) based \nin  ADB  headquarters  will  be  engaged.    The  consultant  will  have  expertise  in  conference \nmanagement and information dissemination.  \n \n22.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Disbursements  will  conform  to  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n23.  The TA will disseminate study results, learning and good practice through a website, \nworkshops, and learning events, bringing together participating countries, development partners, \nsocial enterprises, investors, and civil society organizations. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Investment Climate Facilitation Fund under the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration  Financing  Partnership  Facility  for  Developing  a  Regional  Social  Investment \nExchange Initiative, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign   Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \n       \nInclusive growth by  Increase in the number  TA impact measurement  An SSE will be supported \nproviding goods,  of poor people who  and mapping surveys  beyond pilot stage \nservices, and livelihood  would benefit from     \nopportunities to poor  access to goods and  TA reports  Risk \nand disadvantaged  services of social     \npeople  enterprises  Government enterprise,  The recent economic and \n    trade, investments, and  financial crisis dampens \nMore employment  employment reports  investors' interests and level \nopportunities for the  of investments. \npoor and marginalized   \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nEnhanced awareness  Increased number of  Government enterprise,  There is sufficient critical \nand development of the  social enterprises and  trade, investments, and  mass of eligible social \nregion's social  investors availing of the  employment reports  enterprises that qualify for \nenterprise sector   intermediation services    listing on the proposed SSE \n    TA reports    \nMore intermediation  More capital made    The proposed SSE \nservices between social  available by impact  Social enterprise and  generates investor \nenterprises and  investors  investors' registration data  awareness, interest, and \npotential investors      confidence. \n  Stock exchange reports   \nRisk \n \nThere is insufficient support \nfrom exchange sponsors \nand the public \nOutputs  By 2014:    Assumptions \n       \n1.
