Domestic resource mobilization through sound tax policy and administration is a key \npillar for sustainable development. It is particularly relevant in developing Asia, where a large \nnumber of revenue authorities have low tax collection rates. The objective of this technical \nassistance (TA) is to increase capacity for better informed tax policy and administration. An \nimportant dimension of the TA will be knowledge sharing across Asia and the Pacific. Appendix \n1 contains a detailed design and monitoring framework.1 \n \n2.  Public financial management, including tax administration and policy, is a core thematic \npriority under the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), which is mainstreamed throughout ADB operations. Moreover, ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2020 emphasizes good governance, capacity development, and partnership as key drivers of \nchange.2 Tax administration is an important tool for strengthening governance, which is also a \ncomponent of the regional public goods pillar of ADB\u2019s regional cooperation and integration \nstrategy. \n \n3.  For  ADB  developing  member  countries  (DMCs)  to  reform  their  tax  policies  and \nadministration, and for ADB to provide relevant advice to DMCs, it is essential to have basic \ninformation on internationally comparable data and practices. This information will help DMCs to \nidentify issues relating to domestic revenue mobilization. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The G20\u2019s Action Plan on Development initiated at the G20 Seoul Summit in November \n2010 adopted \u201cdomestic resource mobilization\u201d as one of the nine development pillars.3 The \nAction Plan noted that \u201cit is essential to continue to strengthen tax regimes and fiscal policies in \ndeveloping countries to provide a sustainable revenue base for inclusive growth and social \nequity, as well as to enhance the transparency and accountability of public finances.\u201d The G20 \nspecifically asked international and regional organizations to (i) support the development of \nmore effective tax systems, and (ii) work to prevent erosion of domestic tax revenues. \n \n5.  Total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is low in developing \nAsia, averaging 17.8% in 1994\u20132012 compared to 36.7% for advanced economies.4 In many \nAsian countries, this is partly because of capacity constraints. A large shadow economy in \ndeveloping  Asia  is  also  a  contributing  factor.5 According  to  Global  Financial  Integrity,  a \nWashington-based nongovernment organization, developing countries lost a total of $5.6 trillion \nin  illicit financial  outflows,  including tax  evasion,  in  2001\u20132010.  Asia is  estimated  to  have \naccounted for 61% of the total illicit outflows.6 \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 August 2013. \n2 ADB. 2008.

The shadow economy includes all market-based legal \nproduction of goods and services that is deliberately concealed from public authorities to avoid payment of taxes \nand  social  security  contributions,  or  to  evade  compliance  with  certain  legal  labor  market  standards  and \nadministrative procedures. \n6  D.

Internationally comparable data and information on benchmarks and good practices are \nessential  to  formulating  tax  policy  and  tax  administration  reform  options.  But  comparative \ninformation on tax policy and administration in Asia and the Pacific remains scarce despite \ngrowing demand from DMCs\u2019 revenue authorities and international organizations.7 A report by \ninternational  organizations,  including  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  the  Organisation  for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United Nations, and the World Bank, to \nthe G20 Cannes Summit in November 2011 pointed out that knowledge accumulation on tax \nsystems  in  Asia  is  extremely  limited  compared  to  such  other  regions  as  Africa  and  Latin \nAmerica. The report encouraged ADB to take on a greater role in this area.8 \n \n7.  To enhance tax policy and administration in Asia and the Pacific, a regional approach \ncan be effective whereby developing member countries share knowledge and practices with one \nanother as well as with developed countries. While there is already a regional forum for tax \nadministration bodies in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania (the Study Group on Asian Tax \nAdministration and Research), the lack of a permanent secretariat limits that study group\u2019s \nmedium-term research functions.9  \n \n8.  There  is  momentum,  therefore,  for  ADB  to  take  an  initial  step  on  research  and \nknowledge sharing in the tax area that will help DMCs to identify issues to be explored by their \nown tax policy makers and administrators as well as through ADB country-level operations. \nFurther regional initiatives in this area might also be pursued.  \n \n9.  Tax  administration  bodies  of  Brunei  Darussalam;  Cambodia;  Kyrgyz  Republic;  Lao \nPeople\u2019s  Democratic  Republic;  Maldives;  Mongolia;  Papua  New  Guinea;  Philippines; \nTaipei,China; Tajikistan; and Thailand have already provided ADB with information on their tax \nadministration  bodies\u2019  functions  and  performance.  Moreover,  the  OECD  has  collected  and \nshared with ADB information on tax administration from Australia; People\u2019s Republic of China; \nHong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Japan; Republic of Korea; Malaysia; New Zealand; and \nSingapore. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be better designed tax policy and administration and increased tax \nrevenue collection in participant developing member countries. The outcome will be better \ninformed participant DMCs with respect to tax policy and administration reform options. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will have four outputs: \n(i)  Comparative analysis of tax administration in Asia and the Pacific. The \nreport will gather data and provide an initial analysis report of tax administration \n                                                \n7  J. Martinez-Vazquez. 2011. Taxation in Asia.

The analysis \nwill  be  mainly  descriptive.  A  regional  workshop  to  share  international  good \npractices will also be held. \n(ii)  Capacity  development  activities  for  ministries  of  finance  and  tax \nadministration officials. These activities will support regional training seminars \nto be conducted jointly with other international organizations, including the OECD.  \n(iii)  Tax revenue statistics in Asia. These statistics will compile and analyze annual \nrevenue data in selected DMCs while breaking down such major tax items as \nincome  taxes  and  indirect  taxes  (including  value-added  taxes)  using  an \ninternationally comparable methodology.11 \n(iv)  Empirical analysis of tax administration performance in Asia. The study will \nundertake econometric estimations to evaluate countries\u2019 performance through a \ncross-country analysis of data collected by outputs (i) and (iii). \n \n12.  The TA assumes that tax policy and administration reform is a priority for DMCs and that \nDMCs  are  willing to  provide  and  share  information. The  main  risk  is that  information  and \nknowledge shared is not immediately reflected in the DMCs\u2019 tax policy and administration \nreform process. To mitigate this risk, a follow-up evaluation at the end of the TA will include an \nassessment on demand and feasibility for continuous engagements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $300,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nADB Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency, while ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department \n(ERD)  and  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  (RSDD)  will  be  the \nimplementing agencies. A senior economist at ERD and a public management specialist at \nRSDD will be responsible as team leaders for implementation of the TA. ERD and RSDD will be \njointly responsible for the delivery of outputs (i) to (iii). ERD will be responsible to deliver output \n(iv). ERD will also play the principal role in administering and supervising the TA. Any changes \nin the responsibility for delivery of the expected outputs after TA approval will be processed in \naccordance with ADB project administration instructions on administering grant-financed TA.12 \n \n15.  The TA has been designed with input from ADB regional departments and resident \nmissions, and their continued input will be sought throughout implementation of the TA. \n \n16.  Four international tax policy experts will be required for 9.8 person-months to compile \nthe revenue statistics data for output (iii) and to draft the report (cost: $129,700 for remuneration \n                                                \n10 The initial analysis report aims to cover the following countries: Australia; Brunei Darussalam; Cambodia; People\u2019s \nRepublic of China; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Japan; Republic of Korea; Kyrgyz Republic; Lao People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic; Malaysia; Maldives; Mongolia; New Zealand; Papua New Guinea; Philippines; Singapore; \nTaipei,China; Thailand; Tajikistan; and Viet Nam. \n11 The selection of countries to include in output (iii) is subject to further consultation with the OECD and ADB \nresident missions and to obtaining confirmations of no-objection from participant DMCs. The time period for data \ncompilation will be determined by the availability of source information. \n12 ADB. 2013. Administering Grant-Financed Technical Assistance Projects.

Two editors will be needed for 1 person-month to edit the \nreports for outputs (i) and (iii) (cost: $13,200). Two national consultants (3 person-months) will \nbe needed for desktop publishing and graphic design of the two publications (cost: $7,100). \n \n17.  Individual  consultants  will  be  engaged  for  assignments,  as  the  TA  will  require \ncountry-specific analysis and rapid mobilization of the editorial consultants. ADB will hire the \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time) using the individual consultant system. Disbursements under the TA will be in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Dissemination activities will be conducted in cooperation with ADB\u2019s Department \nof External Relations. All the procurement to be financed under the TA will be carried out in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  The OECD\u2019s Centre for Tax Policy and Administration and its Development Centre will \ncooperate with ADB in implementing the TA. The OECD will provide in-kind contributions, such \nas assisting with information and data collection from participant countries, drafting publications, \nand organizing training seminars. The OECD is not expected to make a financial contribution to \nthe TA. \n \n19.  Appropriate monitoring and evaluation tools will be developed to ensure all consultants \nengaged in the TA perform their tasks as outlined in the terms of reference. Internal and \nexternal peer review will be used to evaluate the reports\u2019 quality and depth of analysis. The \nproduction schedule will be closely monitored to ensure that the established deadlines are met \nfor the timely printing and delivery of the publications. Event evaluations will be conducted for \nthe workshop and training seminars. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented from 19 September 2013 and be completed by 30 June \n2015.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis for \nTax Policy and Administration Research and Capacity Development, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact  By 2018:    Assumption \nBetter designed tax  At least three DMCs  Tax authorities\u2019  Tax policy and \npolicy and  undertake major tax policy and  policy  administration reform is \nadministration, and  administration reforms  announcements  a priority for DMCs. \nincreased tax revenue  reflecting the outcome of     \ncollection in participant  research and capacity    Risk \ndeveloping member  development activities  The TA\u2019s outcome is not \ncountries  reflected in DMCs\u2019 tax \nreform processes. \nOutcome  By project completion:    Assumption \nBetter informed  Participant DMCs\u2019 satisfaction  Follow-up  Information on \nparticipant DMCs with  rating of 80%  evaluation on a  international good \nrespect to tax policy  questionnaire basis   practices enhances \nand administration  reform processes. \nreform options   \nRisk \nInformation provided is \nnot directly applicable \nfor DMCs.  \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
