INTRODUCTION \n1.  During a consultation mission in August 2011, the Government of Lao PDR requested \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide complementary capacity development technical  \nassistance (TA) for supporting decentralized rural infrastructure development to link up with the \nSustainable  Natural  Resources  Management  and  Productivity  Enhancement  Project \n(SNRMPEP) 1  financed by ADB and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The \nADB TA consultation mission visited Lao PDR from 19\u201320 August 2011, and discussed the \nproposed TA for Supporting Decentralized Rural Infrastructure Development. Subsequently, the \nGovernment of the Lao PDR concurred with the overall design, scope, implementation, and \nfinancial  arrangements  outlined  in  the  TA  proposal.  The  TA  is  included  in  ADB\u2019s  2012 \nassistance program for Lao PDR. 2 The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Sector Context \n2.  The  agriculture  and  natural  resources  sector  in  the  Lao  PDR  makes  the  biggest \ncontribution  to  gross  domestic  product  of  any  sector,  and  accounts  for  over  70%  of \nemployment.3 Despite the importance of agriculture to the economy and to household incomes, \nagricultural technology, productive rural infrastructure (PRI), and farmer organizations remain \nunderdeveloped. Over 50% of households are made up of smallholder subsistence farmers with \nan average income of about $200 a year. The majority of smallholders in the sector engage in \nlow-productivity rice production. Poverty is closely linked to food availability, and almost 30% of \nthe rural population remains food insecure. \n \n3.  ADB\u2019s diagnostic assessments (footnote 5) identify low agricultural productivity as the \ncore sector problem, resulting in high rural poverty levels. Sector transition (i.e., agricultural \nintensification,  diversification,  and  agro-industrialization)  is  largely  constrained  by  under-\ninvestment  in  PRI.  Poor  infrastructure  and  supply  chain  logistics  also  limit  agribusiness \ndevelopment. In the Strategy for Agricultural Development, 2011\u20132020, the government aims to \nmodernize and enable economic diversification to market-oriented agricultural production based \non  a  \u2015lowland  approach  to  development\u2016  in  the  northern,  central,  and  southern  regions. \nEstablishing PRI is critical to facilitating private sector participation in the value chain, and \ncontributing to increased incomes for smallholder farmers. ADB\u2019s ongoing assistance supports \nthis strategic priority by addressing both \u2015hard\u2016 and \u2015soft\u2016 rural infrastructure deficits, through \nrehabilitation of irrigation systems and rural access roads, and enhancement of local capacities \nto  manage  the  infrastructure  for  market-oriented  development.  The  realities  of  enhancing \nprovincial autonomy and the ongoing decentralization process also suggest a clear need for \nstrengthening the capacities of local governments (provinces, districts, and village clusters) for \ninfrastructure planning, and operation and maintenance (O&M) as a means to enhanced income \nearning opportunities and livelihoods. \n4.  The country partnership strategy for the Lao PDR emphasizes that ADB\u2019s assistance will \nfocus on improving policies and institutional capacity to support broad-based, private sector-led \ngrowth  through  boosting  productivity,  diversifying  production,  and  stimulating  off-farm \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009.

Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Road Map for Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Environment in \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic. Manila.  \n ", "2   \nenterprise.4 ADB\u2019s assessment, strategy, and road map for the sector outlines support for \ncommercialization and value chain development through improved rural access, transport and \nmobility\u2014including irrigation development and/or rehabilitation, and rural roads improvement. \nThrough improved institutional and human resources capacity for PRI development, the TA will \nsupport this government priority. \nB.  Synergistic Value \n5.  ADB has provided consistent support to the government for the development of rural \ninfrastructure.  Currently,  it  finances  the  SNRMPEP5 and  the  project  preparatory  TA  for \nProductivity Enhancement along the East-West Economic Corridor (EWEC) (footnote 1). The \nSNRMPEP has three components: (i) capacity building for agriculture and natural resource \nsector management,6 (ii) investment in resource management and productivity enhancement, \nand (iii) efficient project management. Subprojects will comprise a mix of rural infrastructure (i.e., \nrehabilitation of feeder roads and access tracks, and construction and/or rehabilitation of small- \nand medium-scale irrigation), together with \u2015soft\u2016 initiatives for farmer groups and technical \nextension services formulated in the districts. \n6.  The  capacity  development  TA  will  build  capacity  to  optimize  cost  effectiveness  of \ninvestments in PRI, and sustain the improved and rehabilitated assets, with particular emphasis \non the SNRMPEP and proposed investments under the EWEC TA. Maintaining rehabilitated \nPRI is essential, as it has a direct impact on delivering and sustaining the intended benefits. \nMost  large-  to  medium-scale  irrigation  schemes  are  underperforming  due  to  inappropriate \ndesign  and  lack  of  O&M.  Systems  are  designed  around  rice  cultivation  and  require \nreengineering to cater to farmers\u2019 demands to diversify to higher-value crops. Local authorities \ncannot  afford  to  finance  comprehensive  O&M  as  provincial  budgetary  allocations  are \nconstrained;  consequently,  the  assets  inevitably  deteriorate.  The  ongoing  irrigation \nmanagement  transfer  (IMT)  process  has  made  a  substantial  contribution  to  increasing the \neffectiveness of irrigation schemes. Water users associations (WUAs) have been charged with \nthe responsibility of setting irrigation service fees. However, in many of the lowland irrigation \nschemes, recovered user charges are insufficient to maintain the operations of pumping stations \nthat rely on expensive electricity. Poor construction quality and associated rehabilitation costs \noften exacerbate the organizational and maintenance burden. The collection of irrigation service \nfees  among WUAs  of  the  community-managed  irrigation  schemes  also  varies  in  terms  of \nmethodologies, rates, and performance.7 A comprehensive review of the lessons learned from \nthe IMT policy is required to address O&M sustainability, affordability, and the capacity of the \nWUAs for O&M of the irrigation schemes. \n7.  The provinces are responsible for funding periodic and routine maintenance of rural \nfarm-to-market  access  roads  linked  to  irrigation  schemes,  placing  a  significant  burden  on \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2011.

Manila (Grants 0144 and 0145-LAO, \napproved on 23 February; DSF-8025LA). \n6  This component will improve national and provincial capacities, including (i) land suitability assessment and land \nuse mapping for the provinces; (ii) capacity development of provincial government line agencies for appraisal or \ndecision-making processes of both public and private investment proposals including economic, financial, and \nsocial aspects; (iii) capacity development of producers associations; and (iv) policy development. The SNRMPEP \ngeographic coverage includes five southern provinces: Attapeu, Champasak, Saravan, Savannakhet, and Xekong. \n7  Collection rates are about 60%\u201370%, which is not enough for periodic O&M. ADB. 2005. Sector Assistance \nProgram Evaluation Report. Manila. ", "  3 \nprovincial  and  district  resources. 8  Here  again,  sustainability  is  only  partly  a  financial \nmanagement  issue;  there  are  technical  issues  linked  to  identifying  economically  and \nenvironmentally optimal and locally adapted design criteria. For instance, rural infrastructure is \ndirectly vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability and change, as well as, indirectly, through \nchanges to the surrounding environment. \n8.  The TA will focus on strengthening provincial and district capacity in planning and in \nO&M of PRI for selected districts included within the scope of the SNRMPEP and the EWEC TA. \nThe TA scope includes (i) basic training in the principles and practice of designing PRI and \nassociated O&M; (ii) higher-level training in geographic information systems (GIS) for planning \nand monitoring PRI investments; (iii) support to train, register, and certify WUAs and farmer \ngroups in the target districts for participatory irrigation management under the IMT process; and \n(iv)  training  on  procurement  and  financial  management  associated  with  PRI  planning  and \ninvestments. \nC.  Lessons Learned \n9.  ADB  has  developed  valuable  experience  around  the  issue  of  maintenance  and \nsustainability of PRI. Previous successful projects supported by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction  clearly  suggest  that  empowering  grass-roots  communities  is  critical  to  ensuring \nownership and responsibility for maintaining assets. Nonpayment and/or low levels of collection \nof O&M fees, and poor routine maintenance of rehabilitated assets are often directly linked to a \nlack  of  awareness  and/or  ownership  among  local  beneficiaries.9 The TA  design  draws  on \nexperiences from ADB\u2019s Northern Community Managed Irrigation Sector Project,10 and the  \nDecentralized Irrigation Development and Management Sector Project.11 The scope of the TA is \nalso  informed  by  the  lessons  learned  in  designing  ADB\u2019s  Northern  Rural  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Sector Project.12 The lessons from this suite of interventions suggest the need for: \n(i) rigorous evaluation of design alternatives, and effective control of civil  works costs; (ii) \ncontinuous  support  for  WUAs  on  improved  cultivation  techniques,  marketing,  routine  O&M \nactivities, and scheme management; (iii) support for the collection of relevant data, bookkeeping \nand maintenance of records of irrigated areas; and (iv) enhanced participation of women in \nplanning, implementation, and benefits. \n10.  The TA will also distill lessons learned and good practices from the activities of the \ngovernment, ADB, and development partners. The Japan International Cooperation Agency is \nimplementing a TA for participatory irrigated agricultural development along the Mekong River in \nSavannakhet province13 and initiating an investment project for rural access improvement in the \nfive southern provinces. Technical knowledge and lessons identified under these interventions \nwill closely inform TA implementation.

Of a total of 17,000 kilometers of road, 9,200 kilometers are in need \nof upgrades (derived from Ministry of Public Works and Transportation information). \n9  A clear illustration of the role of successful community mobilization in maintaining PRI can be seen in Sri Lanka. \nADB.  2002.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be improved quality of PRI assets in the target areas in the \nsouthern Lao PDR. The outcome of the TA will be strengthened local government capacity to \nplan, implement, and monitor PRI development. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The  TA  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  enhanced  planning  and  design  methods  and \nmaintenance regimes introduced for selected rural roads and irrigation schemes, (ii) improved \nproject  implementation  practices,  and  (iii)  institutionalized  supporting  mechanisms  for \nparticipatory O&M and cost recovery. Key indicators will include documented training modules \nand a manual on best practice in PRI planning and O&M. Progress against these outputs will be \nmeasured by the government\u2019s endorsement and/or application of improved methodologies, \npractices,  and mechanisms  in the  subproject  investments  under  the SNRMPEP.  Improved \nmethodologies and practices will also be applied to other ongoing and planned investment \nprojects in six districts.14 The TA will facilitate target community participation with a strong focus \non mainstreaming gender considerations in project implementation for improved sustainability of \nproject outcomes. Knowledge products will be distilled across all the outputs. In particular \u2015good \npractice\u2016 will be identified and captured in manuals related to design; and O&M and cost \nrecovery of the target PRI schemes will be consolidated as part of a communication and \nknowledge plan for effective dissemination and learning. \n13.  The  success  of  the  interventions  will  depend  on  consistent  and  strong  support  for \ntraining measures and capacity development interventions by national and local government \nentities,  and  adoption  of  design  specifications,  upgrades,  and  associated  implementation \npractices by local governments (provincial, district, and village cluster officials). The success of \nthe capacity development measures is also dependent on uptake of improved cost-recovery \nmeasures and management of irrigation schemes by WUAs. \n14.  The identified risks include staff turnover and the possibility that ongoing and/or planned \ninvestment projects fail to internalize improved methodologies and practices. To avoid these \nrisks, central and provincial working groups will be established to coordinate TA activities with \nexisting and planned investment initiatives. Target districts and model sites need to be carefully \nselected to build maximum synergy with ADB-supported projects and other initiatives for rural \ninfrastructure development in the area. District working groups will provide critically important \ncoordination among local stakeholders and across the various activities. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction in the \namount of $1.0 million, and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of staff resources, office accommodation, workshop and logistics support, \nand  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  government  in-kind  contributions  will  include  central, \nprovincial, and district counterpart staff; office accommodation at central and provincial offices \n                                                \n14 The TA will also build on the safeguard training and compliance manuals developed under the SNRMPEP. ", "  5 \nor  equivalent;  data,  administration,  and  clerical  services;  and  communication.  The  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  Institutional arrangements under the TA will dovetail with the established implementation \nframework  under  the  SNRMPEP  to  optimize  synergies.  The  MAF,  represented  by  the \nDepartment of Planning (DOP), will serve as the executing agency. The TA coordination office \nwill be established under the DOP, to attend to day-to-day implementation of the TA. In the \nprovinces, separate provincial TA offices will not be established, but will be included in the \nexisting provincial project offices under the SNRMPEP. The DOP will implement the TA in \ncollaboration with the Department of Irrigation within MAF, provincial agriculture and forestry \noffices  (PAFOs)  in  target  provinces,  and  selected  district  agriculture  and  forestry  offices \n(DAFOs). Under the SNRMPEP, a national steering committee already exists, chaired by the \nvice minister of MAF with representation from key national agencies and provincial coordination \ncommittees. \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a 3-year period from July 2012 to June 2015. An \nestimated 84 person-months of consultant inputs  will be required (17 international and 67 \nnational). Required expertise will include rural development planning, agricultural engineering, \nO&M,  GIS,  environmental  and  social  safeguards,  gender  and  ethnic  groups,  and  financial \nmanagement and procurement. ADB will engage a consulting firm using quality- and cost-based \nselection  (80:20)  and  simplified  technical  proposals.  Some  individual  consultants  will  be \nengaged for preparatory and supplemental assignments. Inputs from the team leader and rural \ndevelopment planner will be frontloaded during implementation to develop design and O&M \nprotocols for proposed PRI assets and associated training components. The team leader will \nalso  guide  the  development  of  the  knowledge  and  communications  plan.  Inputs  will  be \nsequenced to ensure transfer of responsibilities to the deputy team leader and agricultural \nengineer during the final year of the TA, to implement the established protocols and finalize \nknowledge products. All engagement of consultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010,  as amended from  time  to time).  Procurement  under  the TA  will  be  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Costs  for  equipment, \nworkshops,  local  training,  seminars,  conferences,  and  surveys  will  be  included  in,  and \nadministered under, the consulting firm contract. The development of the TA GIS elements will \nfocus on maximizing the use of existing GIS databases held by MAF and other line ministries \nand demonstrating their integrated application in PRI planning and implementation. \n \nIV.
