The Government of India has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare the Subregional Transport Connectivity Project. The TA is included in \nthe country strategy and program for India. Following the Reconnaissance Mission on 6\u201314 May \n2003, a TA Fact-Finding Mission visited India on 25 July 2003 and held discussions with the \nGovernment on the goals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, and terms of \nreference of the TA.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The West Bengal transport corridor is of strategic importance to the economic development \nof northeast India and the neighboring countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. The corridor \nextends from Haldia port off the Bay of Bengal via Kolkata to Shiliguri in the north of West Bengal, \nand then east along the national east-west corridor as far as the state of Assam. The corridor is the \ntransport backbone of West Bengal, the major trade route for India\u2019s northeastern states and \nneighboring Bhutan and Nepal, and provides important links with Bangladesh.  \n \n3.  For the West Bengal Corridor to realize its full economic potential, it must be upgraded to \nnational highway standard; improved feeder links are needed to serve the main subregional users; \nand complementary economic and social infrastructure is needed to support growth in economic \nactivities along the corridor, based on the improved competitiveness and locational synergies \narising from improved transport efficiency.  \n \n4.  ADB is assisting the Government to increase the capacity of the West Bengal Corridor. In \n2000 an ADB TA prepared a strategy and investment plan for development of the corridor.2 The \nADB-financed West Bengal Corridor Project is financing priority investments in that plan.3 The \ninvestments  comprise  improvement  of  (i)  the  national  highway  (NH34)  from  Barasat,  on  the \nnorthern outskirts of Kolkata, to Raiganj, about 370 kilometers (km) north; and (ii) two state \nhighways providing connections with the Bangladesh border at Bangaon (SH1) and Hilli (SH10). \nAdditionally,  under  the  Government\u2019s  National  Highways  Development  Project,  the  National \nHighways Authority of India (NHAI) is upgrading the part of the national east-west corridor in West \nBengal (from Dalkhola to the state of Assam) to four lanes. Under the Government\u2019s support for \nimproving port connectivity, NHAI is also upgrading the national highways linking Haldia port with \nthe west side of Kolkata (NH41 and NH6). With the construction of the second Vivekananda bridge \nand the Belgharia Expressway, this will extend high standard links from Haldia to within about 10 \nkm of the upgraded NH34 at Barasat.  \n \n5.  To complete the upgrading of the corridor, (i) a bypass is needed between Barasat and the \nBelgharia Expressway, in order to complete the high quality through route from NH34 to Haldia \nPort; (ii) NH34 should be upgraded between Raiganj and Dalkhola, to complete the link between \nNH34 and the east-west corridor; and (iii) bridges are needed on NH34 at Baharampur and \nMaldah, to bypass congestion. In view of high traffic levels, the Barasat bypass may offer scope for \nprivate sector participation. \n \n6.  Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, and Nepal have initiated a subregional economic cooperation \nprogram to establish the South Asian Growth Quadrangle. ADB has been facilitating this initiative  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities, Internet edition, on 18 July 2003. \n2  ADB. 1998. Technical Assistance to India for the North-South Corridor Development Project in West Bengal. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to India for \nthe West Bengal Corridor Development Project. Manila. \n ", "2  \nsince 2000, through the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) program. ADB \nhas provided regional TAs to identify and prioritize subregional cooperation projects,4 and to \nestablish and consolidate the institutional framework for regional economic cooperation.5 Because \ntransport is fundamentally important to regional economic cooperation, the transport sector has \nfeatured prominently in the SASEC program. The initial approach has been to (i) establish a \nconceptual framework for subregional cooperation in the transport sector; (ii) assess the current \nperformance of each key corridor, and identify specific impediments to transportation along these \ncorridors; and (iii) develop project concepts for removing the impediments, both physical and \ninstitutional, so as to facilitate the future funding of those projects. Further regional TA has been \nprovided to support these activities.6 As the subregional cooperation deepens, this may lead to \ndesign of improved transit arrangements, and simplification of documentation requirements for \ncross-border traffic.  \n \n7.  Two of the high priority investment projects identified by the SASEC program are for feeder \nlinks into the West Bengal Corridor.7 These are improvement of (i) the state highway from the \nBhutan border at Phuentsholing to the east-west corridor at Hasimara; and (ii) the state highway \nbetween the Bangladesh border at Fulbari and the Nepal border at Kakarbhitta, intersecting the \nnorth-south  corridor.  The  Phuentsholing-Hasimara  link  is  part  of  Bhutan\u2019s  main  trade  route \nbetween the capital, Thimpu, and Haldia Port. Under its proposed road sector loan to Bhutan in \n2005,8 ADB is also expecting to finance upgrading of the road from Phuentsholing to the Thimpu. \nAnother proposed ADB loan to Bhutan, in 2004, is expected to finance development a logistics \nterminal at Phuentsholing.9 The Fulbari-Kakarbhitta link serves transit traffic between Nepal and \nBangladesh, and provides access to the West Bengal Corridor for trade serving eastern Nepal and \nnorthwest Bangladesh. ADB is currently financing improvement of Nepal\u2019s east-west highway to \nKakarbhitta,10 and expects to include support for development of an inland customs depot at \nKakarbhitta under the proposed loan to Nepal in 2004.11 ADB\u2019s road sector loan to Bangladesh in \n200312 includes a component to upgrade the road from Fulbari to Banglabhandh, where it connects \nwith the national highway (N5) to Dhaka via Jamuna Bridge. The Government has indicated that \nbefore committing to investment in improving the link to Fulbari it will require confirmation that the \nGovernment of Bangladesh intends to upgrade the link on the Bangladesh side of the border. \n \n8.  The corridor also provides the transport connection between the state of Sikkim and the \nrest  of  India,  thereby  underpinning  Sikkim\u2019s economy and sense of integration. The national \nhighway  between  Sevok  and  Gangtok  (NH31A)  is  narrow  and  congested,  and  needs  to  be \nupgraded.13 The state highway from Gangtok to Nathula Pass may also need improving. As a \nresult of the decision of India and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to resume cross-border \ntrade via Nathula Pass,14 the link from Sevok to Nathula Pass via Gangtok could play an important \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2000.

In addition, complementary investments are needed in economic and social infrastructure to \nhelp realize the full economic development and trade potential of the West Bengal Corridor. (i) \nPrivate  investment  in  productive  activities  should  be  facilitated.  Under  separate  TA,  ADB  is \npreparing  proposals  to  support  private  investment  in  areas  of  Nepal  that  connect  with  the \ncorridor,16 such as through development of industrial estates and commercial areas. Further TA is \nplanned  to  develop  such  proposals  along  the  corridor  in  India.17  (ii)  Support  is  needed  for \nimprovements in transport operations along the corridor by developing of complementary facilities \nsuch as truck terminals, warehousing and storage facilities, goods transshipment centers, and dry \nports. (iii) Investments are required in trade facilitation measures, as recommended under SASEC, \nincluding improving customs, immigration, and other facilities at border crossings, and simplifying \ndocumentation requirements for cross-border traffic. In view of the high cost of running the existing \ncustoms services at Fulbari, the Government has indicated that before committing to investment in \nfurther customs facilities there, it will need to have made progress in its dialogue on cross border \nmovement  with  the  Government  of  Bangladesh.  (iv)  Investment  is  also  needed  in  social \ninfrastructure, such as rest areas and services for vehicle drivers and passengers. (v) The scope \nfor developing measures to combat HIV/AIDS18 and cross-border trafficking of women and children \nshould be examined.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The purpose of the TA is to assist the Government and the State Government of West \nBengal (SGOWB) to prepare a Project to (i) upgrade subregional transport links along the West \nBengal Corridor, and (ii) introduce complementary economic and social infrastructure to realize the \neconomic potential of the corridor and address associated social needs. The Project will (i) \nstrengthen the regional network of transport infrastructure serving Bangladesh, Bhutan, PRC, \nIndia, and Nepal, including improvement of through connections to and from Haldia Port; and (iii) \nimprove the domestic transport system in India, particularly in Sikkim and West Bengal. These \ntransport  improvements  will  support  growth  in  subregional  trade  and  investment,  thereby \ncontributing to economic growth and poverty reduction. Drawing on and supported by the TA, ADB \nplans to process a loan for the Project in 2004. \n \n11.  The Project will be divided into four groups of subprojects on the basis of implementation \nresponsibilities and location: (i) improvements to national highways along NH34, comprising the \nBarasat  bypass,  the  Raiganj-Dalkhola  section,  and  bridges  at  Baharampur  and  Maldah;  (ii) \nimprovements  to  national  highways  serving  Sikkim,  comprising  the  highway  from  Sevok  to \nGangtok;  (iii)  improvement  of  state  highways  in  West  Bengal  that  provide  subregional  links, \ncomprising the Hasimara-Phuentsholing and Kakarbhitta-Fulbari sections; and (iv) complementary \neconomic and social infrastructure along the West Bengal Corridor.  \n \n                                                 \n15  In order to realize this potential, it will also be necessary to establish necessary customs facilities and procedures at \nthe border, and there may be a need to improve the connecting highway in PRC from Nathula Pass to Yatung.  \n16  ADB. 2003.

Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will complete the preparatory studies required to examine the feasibility of each \nsubproject and to comply with ADB\u2019s safeguard and other policies and requirements for possible \nloan  financing.  The  TA  activities  will  include  (i)  assessment  of  institutional  capacity  and \nimplementation arrangements; (ii) traffic, engineering, and design studies, and cost estimation; (iii) \neconomic analysis, distribution analysis, and poverty impact ratio estimation; (iv) financial analysis; \n(v) poverty and social assessment; (vi) environmental impact assessment; (vii) preparation of a \nresettlement plan; and (viii) support for preparation of indigenous people\u2019s development plan as \nrequired on the basis the findings of the poverty and social assessment.19  \n \n13.  The scope of the TA has been formulated to make full use of preparatory work carried out \nby the Government. Feasibility studies, preliminary social and environmental assessments, and \ndetailed designs are available for the Barasat bypass, and the northern end of the Raiganj-\nDalkhola section (construction of a bypass at Dalkhola), and have been commissioned for the \nSevok-Gangtok section. The TA will review, verify, update, and supplement these preparatory \nstudies to ensure that ADB requirements are met. For the other parts of the Raiganj-Dalkhola \nsection,  the  Baharampur  and  Maldah  bridges,  and  Hasimara-Phuentsholing  and  Kakarbhitta-\nFulbari sections, only preliminary studies have been conducted, and no studies of complementary \neconomic and social infrastructure have been prepared. For these subprojects, the TA will conduct \nall necessary studies to meet ADB\u2019s requirements for possible loan financing (para.  12). The \nsummary initial poverty and social assessment is provided in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n14.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $1 million, including a foreign exchange component of \nabout $529,200 and a local cost component of about $470,800 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $800,000 to meet the entire foreign exchange cost and $270,800 \nequivalent of local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram.  The  Government  will  provide  $200,000  in  kind  to  cover  the  costs  of  office \naccommodation,  transport,  and  counterpart  staff.  Further  details  are  in  Appendix  2.  The \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The executing agencies (EAs) for the TA will be the Ministry of Road Transport and \nHighways (MORTH) and SGOWB. MORTH will be the EA for the national highways subprojects, \nand SGOWB will be the EA for the state highways subprojects in West Bengal. A steering \ncommittee comprised of the EAs and the State Government of Sikkim (SGOS), and chaired by the \nsecretary of MORTH, will oversee implementation of the TA and ensure coordination between the \nEAs. Each EA will appoint a TA director and will assign suitably qualified counterpart staff to work \nalongside the consultants and assist with survey and field work when necessary. In view of the \nlocation of the subprojects, the consultants will be based in Kolkata, with temporary field offices in \nGangtok, Shiliguri, and other places as may be required. For this purpose SGOWB and SGOS will \nprovide suitable office accommodation in West Bengal and Sikkim, together with office support \nstaff, computer equipment, and transport.  \n \n                                                 \n19 ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples  requires that, if indigenous peoples are likely to be affected significantly or \nadversely by a project, the Borrower should prepare an indigenous people\u2019s development plan to provide the \nframework for maximizing project benefits to indigenous peoples and mitigating any negative effects. \n   ", "  5\n16.  The TA will be carried out by a firm of international consultants in association with domestic \nconsultants,  together  with  individual  international  and  domestic  consultants.  The  firm  will  be \nresponsible for engineering; institutional assessment; study of technical, economic, and financial \nfeasibility of road subprojects; identification and study of the feasibility of the complementary \neconomic  and  social  infrastructure;  and  overall  coordination  of  the  TA  consulting  services. \nIndividual consultants will prepare the poverty and social assessment, the resettlement plan, \nindigenous people\u2019s development plan (if required), summary environmental impact assessment, \nand poverty impact study. The consulting firm and individual consultants will also assist the ADB \nmission for processing the proposed Project, including the loan fact-finding and appraisal missions. \nThe  firm  of  consultants  will  include  experts  in  road  engineering,  institutional  strengthening, \ntransport  economics,  transport  services,  and  trade  facilitation.

India needs to sustain high rates of economic \ngrowth to reduce poverty, and growth requires investment in transport since development of the transport \nnetwork was neglected in the past.  \n \nImproved subregional transport will  (i) reduce accessibility to the state of Sikkim and disadvantaged parts of \nthe state of West Bengal in India; (ii) significantly assist Bhutan by upgrading its principal trade route, and will \nenhance trade routes with and between Nepal and Bangladesh; and (iii) enable expansion of economic \ncooperation between the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, and the People\u2019s Republic of China, contributing \nto economic growth and poverty reduction in each country.  \n \nB.  Poverty    Proposed  Other \n  Analysis  Classification: \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe poverty analysis to be undertaken in the project preparatory technical assistance (TA) will focus on \nimproving the ability of the transport corridor to reduce poverty and improve employment and incomes, \nparticularly as a result of increased flows of trade and investment. The analysis will include (i) review of the \nsocioeconomic  and  poverty  status  of  the  project  areas  of  influence,  including  the  nature,  extent,  and \ndeterminants of poverty in these areas; (ii) identification and estimation of the likely socioeconomic and \npoverty reduction impacts of each subproject; and (iii) preparation of proposals for a program of monitoring \nand evaluating the benefits and impacts of the Project before and after construction. \n \nFor  each  road  improvement  subproject,  a  distribution  analysis  of  the  economic  benefits  between \nstakeholders will be prepared, including estimation of the poverty impact ratio. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder analysis: The project will be prepared in a participatory manner. All stakeholders and affected \npeople, including women and ethnic minorities, will be fully consulted during preparation of a resettlement \nplan and as part of any indigenous peoples development plan (IPDP) required. All affected households will \nbe  surveyed  and  will  participate  in  the  inventory  of  lost  assets,  identification  of  compensation  and \nresettlement preferences, and a replacement cost study.  \n \nParticipation strategy required: Yes.
