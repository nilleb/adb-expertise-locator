INTRODUCTION\n1. Bank advisory technical assistance (TA)1 completed in February 1996 reviewed\nand made recommendations relating to the development of the capital market in Fiji. The\nGovernment of Fiji has substantially accepted these recommendations and is taking the\nnecessary steps for their implementation. Further TA has now been requested by the\nGovernment to support the establishment of the Capital Market Development Authority (CMDA),\none of the major recommended steps towards capital market development. The Bank fielded a\nFact-Finding Mission to Fiji in May 1996 in response to the requested TA. The Mission reached\nan understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan,\n.2\nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the consultants for the TA \nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Fiji has a well-developed financial sector, but an embroyonic capital market with\nminimal activity. There is, consequently, a limited range of saving and investment instruments\navailable to the public, and a corresponding lack of financing mechanisms available to support\nprivate sector investment. This is reflected in high liquidity and intermediation margins in the\nbanking system, but low levels of capital investment in the economy.\n3. The Government and the Bank have long recognized the potential for development\nof an active capital market that could contribute to more effective private sector investment and\neconomic growth. The Bank has provided three TAs since 1986 relating to the capital market.\nThe initial two  involved studies of limited duration. A significant outcome was the removal of\ninterest rate controls by the Government, but other progress was less substantive, reflecting the\nlimited scope for Government actions beyond providing a suitable enabling environment in which\nmarkets and market participants can respond and develop.\n4. Accordingly, the most recent TA, No. 2046-FIJ, has provided comprehensive input\nby a team of eight consultants. The TA has not only confirmed the potential for a viable and\neffective capital market and provided a series of related recommendations, but to a much greater\nextent than previous TAs, has enabled the consultants to have wide-ranging discussions with\nGovernment ministers and officials, as well as a broad cross-section of the financial and private\nsector communities in Fiji. In conjunction with public seminars run by the consultants, this has\nincreased local understanding of the potential for capital market activity, and the enthusiasm of\nvarious parties to be involved.\n5. Fiji's financial sector comprises the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF); one Government-\nowned and five foreign-owned commercial banks; the Fiji Development Bank (FDB); four licensed\ncredit institutions that accept deposits from the public; four life insurance and six general\nTA No. 2046-FIJ: Development of the Capital Market, for US$450,000, approved on 23 December 1993. This provided 14 person-\nmonths of input by eight consultants. The final TA report was completed in February 1996.\nThe TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in May 1996.\nTA No. 778-FIJ: Study of Development of Capital Market, for US$71,000, approved on 19 June 1986, and TA 1254-FIJ: Housing Sector\nResource Mobilization Study, for US$199,000, approved on 21 December 1989.", "2\n1\ninsurance companies; and the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) . The ratio of broad money\n(M2) to gross domestic product (GDP) has grown strongly from approximately 40 percent in 1987\nto the present 54 percent,2 indicating considerable depth of monetization of the economy and the\nsignificant role of commercial banks. There has been generally strong liquidity within the\ncommercial banks in recent years, with bank holdings of Government securities and RBF notes\nwell in excess of statutory requirements. Commercial bank lending to the private sector, which\ngrew at an average rate of 21 percent per annum in the four years to 1992, has since\nprogressively moderated to only 3.4 percent in 1995 in response to low investment confidence\n(see para. 10) and rising real interest rates. High bank lending rates and intermediation margins\nnevertheless remain, with average lending rates declining only marginally from 12.5 percent in\n1992 to 11.1 percent in 1995.3 This reflects the limited competition between the primarily foreign-\nowned banks, and the lack of external competition from a significant capital market.\n6. A further important influence within Fiji's financial sector is FNPF. This institution\nreceives contributions from its members of around F$120 million (US$87 million) per annum and\nhas total assets (as of 31 December 1995) of F$1.56 billion (US$1.13 billion), equivalent to the\ntotal deposits of all commercial banks in the country. Because of the limited range of domestic\ninvestment opportunities and constraints on foreign investments,4 only 5 percent of FNPF assets\nare in private sector loans and investments, with the balance predominantly in fixed income debt\nsecurities issued by the Government or Government-owned institutions. While these securities\nare issued on market-based interest rates, FNPF is the major purchaser, and there has been\nminimal secondary market trading. There is also no market in corporate debentures.\n7. As the only stock exchange in the country, the Suva Stock Exchange (SSE) has\noperated as a trading post for shares. Four companies are listed, with a total market capitalization\nof approximately F$50 million (US$36 million). Until recently, there has been no brokerage\ncommunity in Fiji, public awareness of SSE and its role has been minimal, and market turnover\nhas been insignificant at less than F$100,000 (US$72,000) per annum. However, a series of\nrecent measures, resulting in part from TA No. 2046-FIJ, provide the basis for a much more active\ncapital market in future (see para. 11).\n8. The Unit Trust of Fiji, established under its own act in 1976, aims to provide an\ninvestment vehicle for individuals and small-scale investors. However, lack of investment outlets\nfor the trust itself is a constraint, and it has total assets of only F$14 million (US$10 million). A\nlocal investment company, Fijian Holdings Limited (FHL), has become a more significant investor\nwith total investments of F$40 million. Established to promote economic development of\nindigenous Fijians, the company operates as an unlisted public company with indigenous\nownership. A purely commercial investment policy is followed, and FHL now has significant\nownership of seven major unlisted local companies, plus minority equity holdings in two listed\nAs at 31 December 1995, gross assets of the Fiji financial system, excluding RBF, amounted to F$4.43 billion (US$3.2 billion) comprising\ncommercial banks (42 percent); FNPF (35 percent); insurance companies (8 percent); and other institutions (15 percent).\nBased on International Monetary Fund definitions.\nOver this period, a similar decline in bank time and saving deposit rates has occurred, and inflation has dropped from 5.5 to 2.2 percent.\nRelaxation of the Exchange Control Regulations in 1995 has, for the first time, allowed FNPF to invest overseas, up to a limit of F$10\nmillion (US$7 million).", "3\ncompanies. Importantly, FHL provides one of the very few direct indicators of potential public\ninterest in the capital market: a F$3 million share issue by FHL in 1995 was oversubscribed 11\ntimes.\n9. RBF has a dominant influence on Fiji's financial system and markets. The country\nhas a closed foreign exchange regime, and RBF maintains an active monetary policy aimed at\ncontrolling liquidity within the banking system and maintaining foreign exchange reserves. RBF\nnote issuance to sterilize excess liquidity of the banking system is now the main monetary policy\ninstrument in use. RBF has played a key role in encouraging capital market development, and is\nalso responsible for supervision of banks, insurance companies, and certain nonbank financial\ninstitutions. A banking crisis was averted in 1995 when the Government-owned National Bank of\nFiji (NBF) experienced major difficulties. The Government has underwritten the cost of ongoing\nrehabilitation and restructuring of NBF, and RBF has intensified the regulatory and supervisory\nframework of the banking system.'\n10. The political events in 1987 and the resulting crisis resulted in a progressive shift to\nmore market-oriented economic policies. The adoption of an outward-looking strategy since 1989\nhas included trade liberalization and economic deregulation; fiscal consolidation; tax, public\nenterprise, and labor market reforms; and support for privatization of public enterprises as key\nelements. While macroeconomic stability has been well established, implementation of reforms\nhas been uneven, and private confidence has remained weak, reflecting continuing uncertainty\nover constitutional and land-related matters.\n11. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, the recently completed TA No. 2046-FIJ has\nidentified the potential of, and helped stimulate interest and new developments in, the capital\nmarket. Of the 6,000 registered companies in Fiji, the TA survey identified approximately 50 local\nand foreign-owned private companies with potential for listing. Public offerings amounting to\nF$100 million within the next 24 months are estimated, provided confidence in the market\ninfrastructure is developed. This potential will be further expanded by the expected privatization of\na number of state-owned enterprises .2 In fact, the operation of a functioning stock market will be\nan important means of enabling the Government to effectively carry out its privatization program\nand introduce domestic private sector shareholding, in conjunction with foreign investors, in the\nprivatization of several enterprises. SSE has substantially expanded its capabilities and public\nprofile in the past year. A study in 1995 by a British Executive Service Overseas (BESO) adviser\nhas assisted in developing and upgrading the organizational and functional details for the\nexchange and the related requirements of newly established brokerage operations. SSE has\nmoved into prominent premises in a new FNPF office block and, in July 1996, commenced weekly\ncall market trading sessions. As recommended under TA No. 2046-FIJ, both FNPF and FHL are\nestablishing broker/dealer operations (in conjunction with New Zealand and Australian broking\nfirms); and FNPF has established a securities trading subsidiary to trade with the public and\nA new Banking Act was enacted in 1995. This strengthened bank audit and disclosure requirements, established capital adequacy\nstandards in line with the Basle Convention to apply from the end of 1997, and introduced new guidelines on asset classification, in line\nwith international practices.\nA Public Enterprise Bill, currently before a Parliamentary Select Committee, will facilitate the corporatization and privatization of state-\nowned enterprises.", "4\ndevelop a secondary market in Government securities. In addition, the Government is improving\nthe environment for capital market activity with tax incentives to encourage companies to list on\nthe stock exchange introduced in 1996, and further changes under consideration in an ongoing\nincome tax review.\n12. While TA No. 2046-FIJ has helped identify the potential for, and stimulate broad\ninterest in, the capital market, a major outcome was also the recommended establishment of\nCMDA to both lead the development of the capital market, as well as license participants and\noversee the market's operations. Following the Government's and private sector endorsement of\nthe approach, the consultants for the TA assisted in drafting the CMDA Bill, which was passed by\nParliament in August 1996 and is expected to come into effect in late 1996. CMDA will comprise\na Chairman and seven members with relevant private and financial sector experience, together\nwith two public officers and the chief executive of CMDA. The chief executive is to be recruited\nlocally, and RBF is facilitating the provision of technical staff and office facilities for CMDA. While\nCMDA is to be funded in future from fees on capital market activity, the Government has\nconfirmed that it will ensure that CMDA expenses will be fully covered in the initial three years of\noperation.\n13. The immediate challenge in Fiji is to maintain the present momentum and\nenthusiasm for capital market development, while ensuring that public confidence and investor\nsupport are encouraged and developed. In this respect, the establishment and effective operation\nof CMDA will be critical to ensure that appropriate standards are set and adequate performance is\nachieved by market participants. While the Government and RBF have promptly addressed the\nlegislative, staffing, and budgetary requirements for CMDA, there remains a clear need for\nexternal technical advice and support during the establishment phase of the institution.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n14. The objective of the TA is to support the development of an effective capital market\nin Fiji by assisting in the provision of expertise for the institutional development of CMDA in its\ninitial years of operation. This institution, which will have both market development and regulatory\nfunctions, is crucial for ensuring public and investor confidence, and thereby the ongoing\ndevelopment of the capital market.\nB.\t Scope\n15. The TA will assist in meeting the costs of a senior adviser who will support, and\nprovide technical advice to, the locally recruited chief executive of CMDA for a period of 16\nmonths. In addition, the TA will provide for CMDA to secure the input of up to four short-term\ninternational technical advisers for a total input of up to four person-months. The priority areas for\nshort-term technical advisers will become evident only in the future, and will depend on the\nevolving role and staffing of CMDA, as well as the extent and type of external inputs secured by\nother market entities such as SSE and broker/dealers. Accordingly, the mix of short-term inputs\nunder the TA will be determined by CMDA, in consultation with the Bank, within the following", "5\nareas of expertise: securities market regulation, legal aspects of securities markets, stock\nexchanges, securities market public awareness, and staff training (see Appendix 1 for Terms of\nReference).\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The total cost of the TA is estimated at US$630,000 equivalent, including\nUS$600,000 in foreign exchange costs and US$30,000 equivalent to local currency costs. The\nBank will provide US$600,000 to meet the foreign exchange cost, and the Government will\nprovide the remaining US$30,000 equivalent for office accommodation and support (see Appendix\n2). The TA will be financed by the Bank on a grant basis.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n17. To date, RBF has been the prime institution in Fiji focusing on capital market\ndevelopment, and has been the executing agency for the three previous TAs. CMDA is to\nassume, and further develop, most of RBF's capital market functions. Accordingly, RBF will\ncontribute office space, and facilitate the provision of three experienced technical staff (who\nserved as counterparts to consultants for TA No. 2046-FIJ) to CMDA, to ensure the effective\ntransfer of relevant expertise to the newly established institution. The CMDA Act, which has\nParliamentary approval and Presidential assent, is expected to come into effect in December\n1996, thereby establishing CMDA, which will then recruit a chief executive. Implementation of the\nTA will only commence following establishment of CMDA and appointment of the chief executive.\nIt has been confirmed with the Government that the TA consultants are to provide technical\nadvice and support only, and are not available to fill line management positions. CMDA will be the\nExecuting Agency for the TA.\n18. Individual consultants will be internationally recruited for the TA in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. It is envisaged that the senior adviser will\ncommence the 16-month assignment in early 1997 with completion by December 1998.\nIdentification of priority areas for short-term technical input under the TA is expected in 1997-\n1998, with completion of all such assignments by December 1998.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n19. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Republic of Fiji in\nan amount not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 for the Capital Market Development\nAuthority, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "6\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTERMS OF REFERENCE\nA.\t Objectives\n1.\t The objectives of the technical assistance (TA) are to:\n(i) promote the development of an effective capital market in Fiji by supporting\nthe institutional development of the Capital Market Development Authority\n(CMDA), which is to be established with both market development and\nregulatory functions; and\n(ii) provide support and guidance to the chief executive of CMDA in the\nestablishment phase of the institution's operation and provide professional\nleadership and advice for CMDA staff.\nB.\t Senior Adviser\n1.\t Detailed Terms of Reference\n2.
