The Government of Nepal (the Government) has requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) for technical assistance (TA) for capacity building of the Department of Roads \n(DOR) and for a pilot project to enhance the poverty reduction impact of its road projects.1 A \nFact-Finding Mission (the Mission)2 was conducted from 20 to 30 June 2005 and discussions \nwere held with relevant government agencies, donors, and civil society groups. This TA paper is \nbased on the discussions and understanding between the Government and the Mission on the \nimpact,  outcome,  outputs,  scope,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Nepal is still one of the world\u2019s poorest countries, with low per capita income and a high \nincidence of poverty. Poverty is more prevalent and severe in rural areas, where its incidence is \nalmost double that of urban areas. Underprivileged social groups are the most impoverished.   \n \n3.  The Poverty Reduction Strategy and Tenth Plan of the Government highlight the need to \naddress chronic poverty and social exclusion. The Tenth Plan is built on four pillars: (i) broad-\nbased economic growth, (ii) social development, (iii) targeted programs for excluded groups, \nand (iv) good governance to bring the poor into the mainstream development process.  \n \n4.  In line with the Tenth Plan and Poverty Reduction Strategy, ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and \nProgram  (2005\u20132009)  proposes  to  foster  broad-based  and  inclusive  social  and  economic \ndevelopment  to  achieve  sustained  poverty  reduction.  ADB\u2019s  support  for  a  more  inclusive \ndevelopment process will assist the Government to improve access for the poor to basic \nservices, enhance their opportunities for economic advancement, boost their participation in the \ndevelopment process, and address disadvantaged groups\u2019 needs more directly and effectively.  \n \n5.  A major focus of the Government\u2019s Tenth Plan and ADB\u2019s country strategy and program \nin  the  transport  sector  is  to  reduce  regional  socioeconomic  disparities  through  increased \nconnectivity. This will significantly ease social tensions as less developed regions are integrated \nwith Nepal\u2019s mainstream market economy. Transport connectivity will also foster broad-based \ngrowth and support gradual shift away from subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture \nand non-farm activities, which are vital to strong poverty reduction impacts.  \n \n6.  The poverty intervention concept is still new in the transport sector agencies, and \nespecially in the DOR, which is the key government agency responsible for construction and \nmaintenance of the country\u2019s road network. It lacks clear guidelines, systems, and staff with \nskills necessary to address poverty issues in its operations. As a result, there is room to \nenhance the extent of direct poverty reduction impacts for most road projects. In the absence of \nadequate poverty intervention support, the majority of poor people in the vicinity of road project \nsites are less likely to benefit from road construction and upgrading.  \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 August 2005. The TA concept paper was approved by \nManagement on 11 August 2005. \n2 N. Sapkota, Social Environment Officer, Nepal Resident Mission, was mission leader. S.H. Rahman, Country \nDirector, Nepal Resident Mission, provided overall guidance to the Mission. P. Logan, Project Administration Unit \nHead participated in selected meetings. R. Dhakal, Road Network Development Project Social Development \nSpecialist participated during field visits on 22\u201325 June. S. Ra, Senior Country Programs Specialist, assisted on TA \nprocessing issues. \n ", "2  \n7.  The Government has expressed strong commitment to develop the DOR\u2019s capacity for \ndealing more directly with poverty issues in road construction and rehabilitation. The DOR has \nalso planned to set up a social development unit, develop appropriate guidelines, and carry out \na poverty intervention pilot program on some roads under the ADB-financed Road Network \nDevelopment Project (RNDP).  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will help the Government to implement a pilot project and develop DOR capacity \nfor enhanced direct poverty reduction impacts of road projects. The expected TA outcomes are \n(i) enhanced skills and income generation capacity among wage laborers and poor households, \n(ii) institutional strengthening of local nongovernment organizations (NGOs) to serve the poor, \nand (iii) increased DOR capacity to enhance poverty reduction impacts of road projects. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  Consisting of two parts, the TA will include implementing a pilot project and developing \ninterim guidelines for DOR to enhance direct poverty reduction impacts of road projects.  \n \n1.  Pilot Project \n10.  A pilot project will be implemented as a supplementary component of the RNDP to \nmaximize  poverty  reduction  impacts  of  three  roads  under  improvement  (Damak-Gauriganj, \nPauwa-Phidim, and Biratnagar-Bardanga-Urlabari) in Morang, Jhapa, and Panchthar districts. \nThese roads have high potential for poverty reduction impacts. Partner NGOs of the Rural \nMicrofinance Development Center (RMDC), which is the Implementing Agency for the ADB-\nfinanced Rural Microfinance Project, are already operating in these districts, although they have \nnot yet extended their services to the poor living near these road sites. In the interest of \neffectiveness and sustainability, the TA will draw on existing RMDC programs in these districts \nand use existing NGOs to implement the pilot project. The TA will finance initial overhead costs \nfor NGOs to expand their existing services to the RNDP road sites and for implementing new \nactivities under the pilot scheme. The NGOs will organize poor laborers, organize affected \npeople and other poor and vulnerable people into groups, and provide skills training and income \ngenerating activities. The RMDC will then provide microfinance to these groups.3 About five \ngroups (each comprising 20 households) will be formed in each 20\u201325 km section of these five \nroad sections. In this way, the pilot project will take in a total of about 500 households. The \nNGOs will use funds already available under the RMDC for the microfinance needs. DOR staff \nand TA consultants will coordinate the activities of NGOs. Similarly, DOR staff, consultants, and \nNGOs will also work with the contractors and local government agencies to maximize the \nProject\u2019s benefits among the poor. The DOR has committed to continue the activities initiated \nunder the pilot project in partnership with local NGOs for an adequate length of time to ensure \ntheir sustainability, and it will also evaluate results. These will be used to learn lessons and \nimprove design and benefits. This feedback process, then, will be institutionalized within DOR \nas a framework for enhanced poverty reduction impacts in road projects. \n \n                                                 \n3 The social survey team under the RNDP has identified the list of such target households. The TA consultants and \nNGOs will coordinate with the RNDP team. \n ", "                        3\n11.  The pilot project will include mainly three types of activities: (i) situation analysis, needs \nassessments, and social mobilization; (ii) skills training, income generation, and marketing \nand/or community development; and (iii) monitoring and evaluation. The pilot project will be \nimplemented in a phased manner (paras. 12\u201314).  \n \n12.  Phase  1:  Situation  Analysis,  Needs  Assessment,  and  Social  Mobilization  (3 \nmonths). Most of the poor households and laborers are unorganized. They first need to be \nstudied and organized into groups so that they can be effectively mobilized to achieve the \nProject\u2019s objectives. Several activities will be carried out in this respect, including: \n(i)  Stocktaking of existing relevant programs in the RNDP roads\u2019 areas of influence. \n(ii)  Engaging NGOs identified in the districts as service providers.  \n(iii)  Finalizing training programs and identifying trainers. \n(iv)  Disseminating project-related information to local stakeholders (public meetings, \ndistribution of pamphlets, meetings with labor and poor groups). \n(v)  Collecting baseline socioeconomic information and data and identifying target \nhouseholds.  \n(vi)  Selecting poor households and organizing them into groups. \n(vii)  Providing training to the groups on group management, savings, credit, and \nbookkeeping. \n \n13.  Phase 2: Skills Training, Income Generation, and Marketing and/or Community \nDevelopment (12 months). This is a key component of the pilot project. NGOs will help the \ntarget groups to identify and implement appropriate income generation activities. Each group \nwill be provided with appropriate skills training and income generation support. While specific \nactivities and beneficiaries will be finalized by NGOs during implementation, the activities shown \nin Table 1 have been suggested by local stakeholders consulted during the field visits to the \nRNDP districts: \n \nTable 1: Potential Income-Generating Activities Suggested by Local Stakeholders \nA.

Trading at local weekly markets \nSource: ADB fact-finding mission. \n \n14.  Phase 3. Monitoring and Evaluation (3 months).  DOR staff, TA consultants, and \nNGOs will closely monitor the pilot project. Each activity will be carefully evaluated after its \ncompletion. The lessons learned from the pilot program will be considered while developing and \nfinalizing the interim guidelines for DOR. Several activities will be carried out in this phase: \n(i)  Monitoring the process and results of the pilot activities.  \n(ii)  Performing a baseline survey prior to starting the pilot activities and a survey \nafter project completion to determine the benefits of the pilot intervention. \n ", "4  \n(iii)  Preparing a similar survey of a control group that does not benefit from the pilot \nproject to discount any external influences. \n(iv)  Collecting feedback from targeted beneficiaries, government agencies, NGOs, \ncommunity-based organizations, and other relevant stakeholders about the pilot \nprogram\u2019s effectiveness. \n(v)  Preparing monitoring reports and discussing the findings with DOR. \n(vi)  Using lessons learned from the pilot program in drafting the interim guidelines. \n(vii)  Developing a scaling-up or follow-up plan based on this experience. \n(viii)  Disseminating the findings through various communication channels. \n \n15.  Based on information provided by the NGOs consulted during field visits by the Fact-\nFinding Mission, the cost of the pilot activities is tentatively estimated at $4,000 per group. Thus, \nthe pilot project will need a total of about $100,000 for 25 groups in five road sections.  \n \n2.  Developing Interim Guidelines for the DOR \n16.  The TA will assist the DOR to develop interim guidelines to enhance poverty reduction \nimpacts of its road projects. The DOR has planned to set up a social development unit.4 The \nGovernment has committed to provide adequate resources and to continue and maintain this \nunit. The TA consultants will train and work with staff at the social development unit to develop \nthe interim guidelines. Consultation meetings at various levels will be organized to obtain views \nfrom the various stakeholders, including two workshops at each road section (one during \ninception and another at the end of the pilot scheme) and three workshops at the national level \n(during inception, after 12 months, and at the end of the TA). The experience and results of the \npilot project will be taken into consideration while developing the interim guidelines,5 and the \nProject will also draw experience from other similar donor projects in Nepal. \n \n17.  Lessons from the relevant efforts of the Government and other donors have been \nincorporated into the design of this TA.6 These include the need for (i) targeting the poorest of \nthe poor while selecting the beneficiaries; (ii) effective participation of local stakeholders as well \nas senior Government staff from the very beginning of the Project; (iii) simplicity of the project \nmodality; (iv) close monitoring, accountability and transparency at the local level; (v) linkage with \nlocal agencies and NGOs; and (vi) Government ownership of the TA outputs.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  Total cost of the TA is estimated to be $430,000 equivalent, of which $55,000 is foreign \nexchange cost and $375,000 equivalent is local currency cost. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $350,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign cost and $295,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund to be administered by ADB. The Government will finance the balance of the \n                                                 \n4 Although the DOR\u2019s plan to establish a social development unit is not specifically for this TA, it will most \nappropriately serve in implementing the TA, and the TA will likewise help to strengthen the social development unit.  \n5 After 2 years of implementation, the interim guidelines will be reviewed and ADB may provide further assistance to \nfinalize the guidelines or mobilize other funding to ensure completion of the pilots and finalizing the guidelines.  \n6 ADB. 1996.

Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2.  \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The DOR will be the Executing Agency. Its social development unit will coordinate \noverall TA implementation. The DOR will provide counterpart staff and office accommodation for \nthe TA consultants. Its Project Directorate will coordinate the pilot activities. While implementing \nthe pilot project, the DOR will also coordinate with  district development committees, village \ndevelopment committees, and relevant line agencies in the respective districts.  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months. The first 3 months will be spent in finalizing \nthe Program, selecting partner NGOs, needs assessment, and social mobilization. The next 12 \nmonths will be devoted to implementing the pilot activities. The last 3 months will be used to \nevaluate  the  program  while  finalizing  the  interim  guidelines  and  incorporating  the  lessons \nlearned from the pilot scheme.  \n \n21.  There will be total consultancy inputs of 37.5 person-months, 1.5 of which will be \ninternational  and  36  domestic.  The  international  consultancy  will  be  provided  by  a  social \ndevelopment  specialist.  The  domestic  consultancy  will  include    one  social  development \nspecialist and one gender and/or social inclusion expert. The consultants will be selected and \nengaged individually by ADB in accordance with ADB  guidelines.7 Outline terms of reference \nare attached as Appendix 3.  \n \n22.  The TA will also require the services of NGOs to implement the pilot project activities. \nOne NGO will be engaged for each road section.8 NGOs will be selected and engaged directly \nby  ADB  from  among  those who are already working with RMDC under an ADB-financed \nmicrofinance project in the respective project districts. NGOs will work in coordination with line \nagencies in the district and are expected to continue their microfinance activities beyond the \npilot phase. Outline terms of reference and eligibility and selection criteria are presented in \nAppendix 4. Procurement of equipment will be undertaken in accordance with ADB guidelines \nand will be turned over to the Government after completion of the TA.9  \n \n23.  The TA is expected to commence in February 2006 and be completed in August 2007. \nThe consultants will submit an inception report within 1.5 months after the start of the TA, \nprogress reports every 3 months, a draft final report after completion of the core TA activities, \nand a final report after incorporating ADB\u2019s comments. The consultants will provide all of the \nabove reports to the Executing Agency and ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $350,000 to the Government \nof Nepal to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund for \nEnhancing Poverty Reduction Impact of Road Projects, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2005.
