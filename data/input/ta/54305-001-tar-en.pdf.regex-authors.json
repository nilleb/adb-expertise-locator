THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The proposal. The proposed regional transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will \nsupport the developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in South \nAsia to enhance the integration of gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) in project design \nand implementation and achieve greater GESI results.  It aims to deliver three main outputs: (i) \nimproved quality of GESI mainstreaming at entry, (ii) enhanced implementation, monitoring, and \nreporting of GESI results, and (iii) strengthened GESI capacities of sectors and partners. The TA \nfacility  will  support  239  projects  (117  projects  in  the  pipeline  and  122  projects  under \nimplementation) across sectors of the South Asia Department (SARD).1 To ensure consistency \nin following through the implementation of this TA facility, the same set of consultants will be \ncontracted to attend to the multiple ensuing and/or ongoing projects.  The same implementation \narrangement will be adopted to ensure smooth coordination between the consultants and project \nteams.  \n \n2.  Progress in gender equality in South Asia.  Despite the global progress in gender \nequality mainstreaming and push for greater women economic empowerment, gender remains \nstrongly interlinked with poverty and inequality. While all six DMCs of SARD did well in reducing \nthe gender gap in education and health and survival, they were still far from closing the gender \ngap  in  economic  participation  and  opportunity,  and  political  participation. 2  This  gender \nperformance is reflected in select national gender development indicators (Table 1), which show \nthat while women, compared to men, have a higher life expectancy at birth and net enrollment \nrate in secondary education (except in Maldives), they have significantly lower completion rate in \nsecondary education (except in Maldives and Sri Lanka), labor force participation rate, and \nproportion of seats in national parliaments. \n \nTable 1.

Overall, the South Asian countries have made great strides in reducing poverty over the \nyears. In Bangladesh, the multidimensional poverty index (MPI) decreased from 0.344 in 2004 to \n0.198 in 2014.3 In Bhutan, the MPI declined from 0.175 in 2010 (footnote 3) to 0.050 in 2012 and \nfurther to 0.023 in 2017.4 India halved its MPI from 0.283 in 2005\u20132006 to 0.123 in 2015\u20132016 \n(footnote 3). The MPI of Maldives decreased from 0.018 in 20095 to 0.003 in 2016\u20132017 (footnote \n3). Nepal\u2019s MPI also halved from 0.350 in 2006 (footnote 5) to 0.148 in 2016 (footnote 3). Sri \nLanka had an MPI of 0.021 in 2003 (footnote 5), which decreased to 0.009 in 2016.6 However, \nwhile the countries have achieved significant progress, the report,  Global Multidimensional \nPoverty  Index:  Illuminating  Inequalities  (UNDP  &  OPHI,  2019),  suggests  that  South  Asian \ncountries are still trailing behind other countries in the region. Over one-third of multidimensionally \npoor in the world live in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal.  Multidimensional poverty is higher \nin rural than urban areas, and unequal among age groups with children suffering the most.7 \n \n4.   Intersecting inequalities. The different levels of multidimensional poverty bring to light \nthe concept of intersecting social inequalities based on sex, age, disability, gender identity, \ngeographical  location,  and  income  status.8 This  conceptualization  of  inequality  focuses  on \nindividuals and groups with multiple marginalized identities. It includes men and boys who \nexperience social exclusion not based on their gender identity but other disadvantaged identities \nand disabilities. Paying attention to intersecting inequalities is at the core of the principle of \n\u201cleaving no one behind,\u201d which underpins the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and its \nobjective to \u201ceradicate poverty in all its forms, end discrimination and exclusion.\u201d9 \n \n5.   Intersecting inequalities are evident during disasters, such as the coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic. The most affected among the poor are women, older people, persons with \ndisabilities, and those with overlapping marginalized identities. According to a recent survey of \nUN Women on the consequences of COVID-19, in Bangladesh, Maldives, and Nepal, more \nwomen in formal or informal employment have experienced a decrease in income from paid jobs \nsince the spread of COVID-19.10 With all school children at home, decreased income, and no \navailable transport, more women\u2014being traditionally responsible for unpaid care and domestic \nwork\u2014carry the heaviest burden of managing all of these needs (footnote 10). Moreover, there \nare reports that with many women and girls forced to \u2018lockdown\u2019 at home with their abusers, \ngender-based violence (GBV) has increased during the pandemic. The recent UN-Women survey \nreported that more than 40% of civil society organizations providing services to women victims of \nviolence saw increases in cases of violence perpetrated by family members.11    \n \n \n \n3  UNDP and Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI). 2019.

An ADB study defines social \nexclusion as a cause and consequence of capability deprivation in different forms (e.g., to live a \nminimally decent life, participate in governance) and explains its different dimensions.12  First, \nexclusion is relational deprivation in that some are deprived while others are not; hence, an issue \nof inequality. Second, deprivation is involuntary. Third, deprivation may be constitutively relevant \n(i.e., it is unacceptable, such as malnutrition) or of instrumental importance (e.g., landlessness \nleads to poverty of farmers). This third point is related to vulnerability, which means being at risk \nof deprivation. Fourth, deprivation could be active (i.e., deliberate in policies and programs) or \npassive (i.e., unintentional due, for example, to lack of resources or capacity). The study also \nhighlights the issue of \u201cunfavorable inclusion,\u201d where there is an attempt to include but on unequal \nterms (e.g., unequal wage for work of equal value, unequal participation in decision-making). This \nconceptualization of exclusion, vulnerability, and unfavorable inclusion will guide the strategies of \nthis TA facility in promoting social inclusion.  Social inclusion is the process of improving the \nparticipation in society of people who are disadvantaged based on, among others, sex, disability, \ngender identity, sexual orientation, and economic status, through enhanced opportunities, access \nto resources, voice, dignity, and respect for rights.13 \n \n7.  Expanding and deepening GESI solutions and results.  Like its precursor regional \nTA,14 the proposed TA facility will give priority attention to women and girls who experience social \nexclusion, vulnerability, and unfavorable inclusion. This TA will also support male engagement in \npromoting gender equality and women empowerment (GEWE) (e.g., recognition, reduction, and \nredistribution of women\u2019s unpaid domestic and care work; supporting women\u2019s entry in sectors \nassociated with men; and addressing the effects of the patriarchal view of masculinity and \nfemininity on men and boys). The TA will also respond to other issues of social exclusion  and \nvulnerability of men/boys, women/girls and other socially excluded groups.15 This expanded focus \nis in response to the challenge set by ADB Strategy 2030\u2019s priority for addressing remaining \npoverty and inequalities, and the assessed persistence of gender bias against women.16 It will \nsupport the integration of gender equality targets in at least 71% (239) of SARD\u2019s projects or \nprograms by 2024\u2014with 50% of the projects categorized as gender equity theme (GEN) or \neffective gender mainstreaming (EGM)\u2014and increase the access of the poor and vulnerable to \ndevelopment opportunities in different sectors.17  \n \n8.  For effective implementation, this TA facility will build on the lessons of SARD\u2019s regional \nTA8311:  Enhancing  Gender  Equity  Results  in  South  Asia  Developing  Member  Countries, \nimplemented in 2010\u20132020. Foremost of these lessons is the importance of collaborative or \nconvergence approach between the ADB resident missions and headquarters, between the Office \nof the Director General, SARD (SAOD) and sector divisions, between SARD and other ADB \ndepartments, and between ADB and the executing and implementing agencies, not only in \ntapping  available  resources  but  also  in  designing,  refining,  implementing,  and  evaluating \n \n12   A.

Alignment with ADB priorities.  This TA facility is aligned with the second operational \npriority (OP2) of ADB Strategy 2030, \u201caccelerating progress of gender equality.\u201d It embeds OP2 \nand OP1, \u201caddressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities,\u201d across all sector projects. It \nalso complements with operations contributing to other OPs.18 The proposed TA facility will \nstrengthen the contributions of the South Asian countries to the achievement of the Sustainable \nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 1 (no extreme poverty), SDG 5 (gender equality), \nand SDG 10 (reduced inequalities), and the upholding of the SDG principle of \u201cleaving no one \nbehind.\u201d  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Quality of gender action plan for ensuing projects improved at entry. \nOutput 1 aims to enhance the social and gender features of the design, including the gender \naction plan (GAP), of supported projects by integrating relevant social inclusion elements, as well \nas approaches for male engagement in the promotion of GEWE. Hence, output 1 will supplement \nthe current gender equality framework and tools available in ADB.19 In this line, the TA will support \nthe review of existing ADB operational frameworks and develop guidance notes, which will aid \nproject teams, including executing and implementing agencies, in identifying GESI solutions to be \nincorporated in project design. This TA will also support the rolling out of the guidance notes for \nensuing projects, with emphasis on infrastructure, sustainable cities, renewable energy, water \nsupply and sanitation, and climate change adaptation. An international consultant (i.e., GESI \npolicy reform expert) will be engaged to provide technical support in developing and rolling out of \nthe guidance notes, together with the project teams. The consultants based in resident missions20 \nwill ensure the integration of key social dimensions in the GESI analysis and in the preparation of \nthe GESI AP, including the proper assessment of the feasibility of the GESI AP. Output 1 intends \nto ensure that SARD operations are designed to be inclusive and sustainable. \n \n11.  Output 2. Quality of implementation, monitoring, and reporting of gender equity and \nsocial inclusion results strengthened. Output 2 aims to facilitate the effective implementation, \nmonitoring, and reporting of the results of the GAPs or GESI APs of ensuing and ongoing projects. \nThe TA will procure consultants (national and international) to provide continuing support to \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  for  the  effective  and  successful  completion  of  the \nGAPs/GESI  APs  of  GEN-  and  EGM-categorized  projects  (including  those  identified  for \ncoronavirus disease [COVID-19] response) through participation in review missions, mid-term \nreview missions, and project completion missions.21 The engaged international consultants (i.e., \nGESI and operations management expert, GESI policy reform expert) will help the national \n \n18  The other operational priorities of ADB Strategy 2030 are \u201ctackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability (OP3);\u201d \u201cmaking cities more livable (OP 4);\u201d \u201cpromoting rural \ndevelopment and food security (OP 5);\u201d \u201cstrengthening governance and institutional capacity (OP 6);\u201d and \u201cfostering \nregional cooperation and integration (OP 7).\u201d \n19  The guidance note will include guide questions to identify whether a proposed project or program has relevant social \ninclusion issues; identify individuals and groups that could benefit from the resources, services, and opportunities \nof a program or project; and design an appropriate GESI Action Plan (GESI-AP). \n20  On the average, consultants devote 10 days for project design for GEN-EGM categorized projects and 5 person-\ndays for SGE categorized projects.  \n21   It is estimated that for GEN-EGM categorized project, a consultant will devote, on the average, 10-15 person days \nper project for implementation, and about 5-10 days for (preparing) project completion reports (PCR). The resident \nmission-based consultants support over 100 GEN/EGM-categorized projects under implementation, and about 20 \nPCRs a year.  \n ", "5 \nconsultants  (based  in  resident  missions)  document  the  good  practices  and  deliver  quality \nGAP/GESI AP completion reports. The consultants will also contribute to the identification of (i) \ninnovations or strategies to improve GESI implementation, monitoring, and reporting of results; \n(ii) opportunities for male engagement in GEWE; and (iii) areas for enhancement of care services \nfor victims or survivors of GBV, children, older people, and other vulnerable groups. To improve \nthe tracking of GAP/GESI APs of ongoing operations, the TA will support the enhancement of the \nSARD Tracking System to provide real-time reporting of GESI indicators listed in the ADB \nCorporate Results Framework and Strategy 2030 Operational Plan for Priority 2 (2019\u20132024). \nThe  SARD  GESI  Network,  composed  of  headquarters-  and  resident  mission-based  social \ndevelopment officers and consultants, will regularly meet through video conferencing and in \nannual retreats to cross-fertilize experiences. International consultants will also be recruited to \nprovide specialized inputs in new areas of the SARD portfolio. The consultants will be working in \nclose coordination with SARD\u2019s GESI network. \n \n12.   Output 3: Capacities of sector agencies and partner networks to mainstream \ngender equality and social inclusion in sector programs and projects strengthened. Output \n3 will have three complementing components aimed at enhancing the capacities of sector \nagencies to ensure effective integration of GESI elements in the project development cycle, from \nproject design (relative to output 1) to implementation and monitoring until project completion \n(relative to output 2). First, the TA will strengthen sector networks relevant to ADB operations \nthrough deep-dive lateral learnings, sub-regional conferences, and national workshops. It will \nsupport the establishment of national and regional networks advancing GESI in key sectors, such \nas the Women in Power Sector Professional Network (We-POWER) in South Asia and similar \nnetworks for transport, urban development, and water supply and sanitation sectors. Second, it \nwill support the organization of national workshops for training of executing and implementing \nagencies in GESI mainstreaming with the participation of resident mission-based staff and partner \ncivil society organizations/nongovernment organizations. And third, to guide current and future \nSARD operations, lessons and good practices drawn from project implementation and monitoring \n(under Output 2) will be packaged into knowledge products, including: (i) basic, intermediate, and \nadvanced training modules on GESI mainstreaming in core sectors; (ii) select toolkits (e.g., a self-\nassessment tool for infrastructure sector agencies and utilities) on integrating GESI in sector \noperations; (iii) SARD Working Papers on the GESI framework, male engagement in GEWE, \ngender-responsive budgeting and affordability of child- and elderly care service provisions; (iv) \nGESI results case studies [six in-country series]; (v) videos; and (vi) impact evaluation of selected \nprojects for GEN- or EGM-categorized projects and programs. International and national experts \nwill be engaged for the production and dissemination of these knowledge products in conferences, \nworkshops, and electronic platforms. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $2,200,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($1,617,000 from TASF-6 and $583,000 from TASF-\nother sources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1.  The governments were \ninformed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency and will administer the TA facility.  SARD\u2019s GESI Team, \nunder the Office of the Director General, Portfolio, Results and Quality Control Unit (SAOD-PR), \nwill be responsible for implementing the TA facility in close coordination with sector divisions and \nresident missions within SARD. The TA facility is categorized complex. The TA activities will be \n ", "6  \nimplemented in close consultation with the executing and implementing agencies in South Asian \ncountries. Activities at the project level will commence upon approval of the Project Concept \nPaper or Report and Recommendation of the President of the projects to be supported by the TA \nfacility.  \n \n15.  The  SAOD-PR  GESI  Team  will  be  responsible  for  the  selection,  recruitment,  and \nevaluation of consultants; and will coordinate closely with sector divisions and resident missions \nwithin SARD and executing agencies/implementing agencies in South Asian countries.
