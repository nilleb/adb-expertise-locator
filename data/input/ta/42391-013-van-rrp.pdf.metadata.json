THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) proposed administration of grants to be provided by the Government of Australia, \nboth to the Republic of Vanuatu for the Port Vila Urban Development Project. \n \n2.  The proposed Project will improve drainage, roads, and sanitation systems in the greater \nPort Vila municipality and adjacent urban and periurban areas. The project will implement the \nrecommendations  of  the  drainage  and  sanitation  master  plan, 1  which  identified  priority \ninterventions  for  improved  access  and  support  to  affordable,  sustainable,  and  effective \nsanitation, roads, and storm water drainage services, contributing to climate-resilient urban \ndevelopment in and around Port Vila.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Port Vila, with about 44,000 residents, is the largest population center, main commercial \ncenter, and seat of government in Vanuatu. It has expanded beyond its originally defined urban \nboundaries as a result of rapid economic development, rural\u2013urban migration, and proliferation \nof informal settlements. The estimated population of the resulting Greater Port Vila area in 2009 \nwas 58,000 residents. By 2025, this figure may reach 109,000. This does not take into account \nthe estimated 3,000\u20134,000 tourists that visit Port Vila at a given time. The tourism sector is the \nlifeline  of  the  national  economy.  Urban  development  and  the  quality  of  urban  services  in \nPort Vila  have  significant  implications  for  the  tourism  led  economic  growth  and  overall \ndevelopment  of  Vanuatu.  Significant  inadequacies  continue  to  exist  in key  areas  of urban \ndevelopment,  particularly  in  drainage,  roads,  sanitation,  and  hygiene  services.  The  poor \nconditions of these services are adversely affecting public health, economic activities, and the \noverall quality of life of Port Vila residents and visitors.  \n4.  Major surfaced roads are heavily potholed and deteriorated  as a result of deferred \nmaintenance and the absence of a system to drain the storm water resulting from frequent \nheavy downpours. The runoff from these downpours causes flooding and chaotic conditions for \nthe vehicle and pedestrian traffic of the city, resulting in considerable financial and economic \nlosses. All road debris (such as silt, grit, garbage, waste, and oil) reach the sea, damaging the \nmarine environment. The system for removal and disposal of human waste from households \nand business premises is environmentally unsatisfactory, as untreated sludge is disposed of in \nopen  pits  near  major  waterways,  exposing  the  urban  population  to  waterborne  diseases. \nCommunities as well as major public areas of the central business district lack safe and hygienic \nsanitation facilities. Vanuatu is also extremely vulnerable to natural disasters because of its \ngeographical location in the \u201cring of fire\u201d and the \u201ccyclone belt\u201d of the Pacific. It is at risk from a \nwide range of climate-related hazards, such as tropical cyclones and floods that are expected \nover time to increase in severity and frequency, warranting emphasis on climate resiliency.  \n5.  Sustainable urban development through improved access to basic services, such as \nsanitation, drainage facilities and urban infrastructure, is an important priority for the government \n                                                \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2009.

Manila. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "2 \nunder its Priorities and Action Agenda (PAA), 2006\u201320153 and a medium-term action program \nentitled Planning Long, Acting Short Action Program, 2009\u20132012.4 This is one of three core \nsectors5 for support under the country partnership strategy of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  for  Vanuatu,  2010\u20132014. 6  The  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development \n(AusAID), the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the New Zealand Aid Programme \nare providing a wide range of support covering urban, rural, and interisland transport and \ncapacity building. ADB and AusAID are expected to assist the government to improve the urban \ninfrastructure and services in Port Vila and its periurban areas. In financing and implementing \nthe PAA, the government\u2019s strategy is to maximize grant resources, especially from bilateral \nsources. The government recognizes that partnership with ADB in conjunction with bilateral \npartners can result in a higher level of resource flow for PAA, and greater ability to design and \nimplement integrated projects such as this proposal.7 The project design took into consideration \nthe potential for user management and public private partnership in the operation of project \nassets, utilizing experience from the Port Vila water supply system.  \n6.  The proposed project is designed to implement the investment plan to improve drainage \nand the associated road network as part of the drainage and sanitation master plan for 2011\u2013\n2025.8 For improving sanitation, it will construct a sludge treatment plant that will eventually be \nthe site for a fully piped sanitation system for greater Port Vila. An integrated approach will be \nused to ensure active involvement of the youth and women in hygiene and health education and \nawareness activities in the periurban, informal, and rural settlements. Explicit methodology will \nbe developed for public\u2013private partnerships, and community and civil society participation as \nwell as labor-based approaches in the construction, and operation and maintenance (O&M) of \nroads, drainage, sanitation, and hygiene facilities. Mitigation of adverse environmental impacts \nand appropriate investment in climate proofing will also be included in the project.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The expected impact of the project is sustained urban development of Port Vila. The \nexpected outcome is that the government has sustainably improved the hygiene situation and \nreduced water-based hazards in Port Vila. \nC.  Outputs \n8.  Output 1: The government has improved the road network and drainage system in \ngreater Port Vila. This output will comprise (i) repair, improvement and/or renewal of roads with \nkerbs, footpaths, and other essential road features; and (ii) provision of a new storm water \ndrainage system and improvement of existing drains in the highest priority flood-prone areas \ntogether with new channels. A total of 7 square kilometers of drainage basins in five catchment \nareas will be supported for roads and drainage improvements. About 22 kilometers of roads will \nbe rehabilitated within these five catchment areas.9 The project will install grease and silt traps \nbut its scope and design will be open to incorporate additional measures that will allow further \n                                                \n3  Government of Vanuatu, Ministry of Finance and Economic Management. 2006.

During  preparation  of  the  detailed  design,  the  extent  of \nenvironmental impacts will be examined and further appropriate actions will be recommended. \n9.  Output 2: The government has improved the sanitation system in greater Port Vila. \nThis output will improve the disposal and treatment of the sludge from domestic and commercial \nseptic tanks by (i) improving the management of the privately operated sludge collection and \ndisposal system, (ii) designing and constructing a sludge treatment plant (STP) and disposal \nfacility, (iii) transferring the sludge disposal site from its current location in Bouffa to a new site \nfor disposal and treatment of sludge (which will also be the site for sewage treatment in the \nfuture), and (iv) constructing a biogas plant as a clean development mechanism (CDM) 10 \nproject as an integral part of the STP. The STP will be the first step toward a piped sewerage \nsystem. The biogas plant will generate electricity for use by the STP. \n10.  Output  3:  Central  area  and  settlement  communities  use  improved  hygiene \nfacilities. This output will (i) set up a number of multipurpose, multi-user sanitation facilities \nincluding toilets, washing, and bathing facilities in villages and periurban settlements, selected \non the basis of a demonstrated need and willingness by the community to contribute to the O&M \nof facilities; (ii) upgrade, rebuild, or refurbish public toilets, principally in the city center and \nlocated at major publicly owned sporting facilities; and (iii) involve women in site selection and \ndesign of sanitation facilities and maintenance activities. \n11.  Output 4: Government agencies and community and user organizations have the \ncapacity to manage sanitation, roads, and drainage systems effectively and efficiently. \nTraining programs will be implemented on (i) planning and policy improvement in hygiene and \nsanitation,  drainage,  and  road  development  such  as  preparation  and  consultation  on  the \nsanitation policy, building code, Public Roads Act, and Traffic Management Act; (ii) O&M, \nmonitoring, and quality control of urban road networks and sanitation and drainage facilities; (iii) \nproperty tax administration and  contract management  under public\u2013private partnership; (iv) \nhygiene and health education and awareness for community organizations; and (v) household \nsanitation improvement with direct participation of women and youth. An O&M plan will be \ndeveloped  for  the  project  assets  in  consultation  with  other  development  partners,  key \ngovernment agencies, and the private sector, drawing lessons learned from other projects. \nSpecific  training  will  be  provided  on  (i) gender  awareness  in  hygiene  and  sanitation  for \ngovernment  agencies, and  community  organizations,  and  (ii)  O&M  of  communal  sanitation \nfacilities for women and youth groups. All training programs will be developed and implemented \nin close consultation with other development partners\u2019 programs, such as the technical and \nvocational education and training of AusAID. The approach and methodology and conduct of \nawareness raising, education, and information dissemination on sanitation, and hygiene and \nhealth promotion will be coordinated with relevant  agencies including NGOs, the domestic \nprivate sector, operators of commercial vessels, hotels, and restaurants. \n12.  Output  5:  Efficient  project  management  services  are  provided. This output will \nprovide  necessary  technical  support  and  advisory  services  to  the  executing  agency  and \nimplementing agencies in implementing the project efficiently. Advisory, training, and support \nservices will be provided through the engagement of international and national experts for \n(i) project  administration;  (ii)  preparation  and  implementation  of  a  project  performance \nmonitoring  system;  (iii)  design,  procurement,  and  contract  supervision;  (iv)  gender \nmainstreaming in project management; (v) project benefit and monitoring and evaluation system \ndevelopment; and (vi) climate proofing of infrastructure. \n                                                \n10  The CDM allows emission-reduction projects in developing countries to earn certified emission reduction credits, \neach equivalent to one ton of carbon dioxide. \n ", "4 \nD.

The Ministry of Infrastructure and Public Utilities (through its Public \nWorks Department) and the Department of Environmental Protection and Conservation (DEPC) \nwill be the key implementing agencies. The MFEM will establish a Vanuatu Project Management \nUnit (VPMU) as a dedicated unit for managing large and nationally significant projects, with \nallocation of budget and core staff. The VPMU will also be responsible for day-to-day project \nimplementation.  Consulting  services  will  be  provided  to  assist  the  VPMU  in  project \nimplementation.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n17.  A master plan for drainage and sanitation assessed the conditions of existing physical \nfacilities and the adequacy of services, along with current and projected demand for drainage \nand sanitation services. This was followed by planning area studies including site selection, \nengineering  requirements,  a  detailed  investment  program,  proposed  project  outputs  and \nactivities,  implementation  arrangements,  and  project  management  structure.  The  technical \nassessment identified areas most affected by road and drainage problems, which led to the \npreparation of a plan of action and the proposed project. An environmentally safe methodology \nfor the final disposal of human wastes was also identified, which comprises safe removal and \ndisposal at the project-financed STP and integrated biogas plant to generate electricity for the \nSTP. The potential for developing a CDM project through the STP and biogas plant was also \nexamined. Social studies identified those areas that are in greatest need of improved public and \ncommunity sanitary facilities. Because of the limited capacity in the domestic industry, most \nconstruction will need to be done by international firms. All designs include climate change \nadaptation strategies, developed in accordance with projections from the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change that allow for a 0.2 meter rise in sea level over the next 50 years. \n18.  To determine the necessary institutional reforms, analyses examined the structure and \nstaffing of the relevant government agencies, existing legislation and regulations, and capacity \nfor public administration. Policy and legislative reforms such as the sanitation policy, public \nroads act, traffic management act, and national building code were identified to complement the \ninfrastructure and service support scheme that will improve the overall viability of the sector. \nThe project will provide support to the DEPC to (i) initiate policy discussions and dialogues with \nuser  groups  on  available  options  and  associated  projects  related  to  waste  treatment; \n(ii) establish strong engagement and partnerships with the business community, comprising \ncommercial and tourist vessels, and hotels and restaurant operators for awareness raising on \nenvironmental  standards;  and  (ii)  oversee  early  compliance  with  appropriate  disposal  and \ntreatment of wastes.  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n19.  Economic benefits include (i) improved road access, significant vehicle operating cost \nsavings,  and  decreased  travel  time;  (ii)  flood  management  and  flood  damage  prevention; \n(iii) solving sanitation and health problems, resulting from existing open-air dumpsite, via an \nSTP; (iv) improved hygiene from building new and upgrading existing communal public toilets; \nand (v) strengthened institutional capacity of government agencies and user communities to \nmanage the road, drainage, and sanitation systems.  \n20.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated as 23.4%. The EIRR for the \nsludge  facility  includes  the  economic  return  from  a  biogas  plant  through  cogeneration  of \nelectricity and carbon credit as a CDM project.12 Sensitivity analyses for the individual outputs \nand the overall project indicate the EIRRs are robust. There are also significant nonquantifiable \nbenefits such as improved living conditions and better environment, plus multiplier effects, \nparticularly from the likely increase in the demand for services by tourists and inward investment \nas core infrastructure and amenities in the capital are improved. \n                                                \n12 The CDM revenue will accrue to the MFEM. \n ", "7\n \n21.  The fiscal impacts and sustainability analysis conducted during the preparation of the \nproject suggest a strong commitment of the government and its policies toward sustainable \nurban development, particularly on sanitation and hygiene. However, the government\u2019s current \nO&M budget is inadequate to sustain the regular repair and maintenance of the roads and \ndrainage  infrastructure.13 The  government\u2019s  PAA  strategy  has  identified  the  provision  of \ncommercial, high-quality, efficient, and competitively priced infrastructure, utilities, and services, \neither through public enterprises or through private sector partnerships and competition. A well-\nengineered, high quality road and drainage network that is durable and has minimal periodic \nmaintenance requirements is envisioned. Further guidance to the government on different fiscal \noptions  for  O&M  will  be  provided  through  the  extended  phase  of  the  project  preparatory \ntechnical assistance (footnote 1) and during the early part of project implementation. \n22.  The MFEM will ensure the financial sustainability of O&M of the road and drainage \nsystems through national budget provisions.14 The project will support development of a long-\nterm O&M financing plan including (i) the sustainability of the O&M budget and its utilization, \n(ii) identification of specific outsourcing models, and (iii) capacity building of the domestic private \nsector. O&M of the STP will be minimal as the facility will be operated through a service contract \nwith the private sector that will collect fees. The government will review the necessary fees to be \ncollected by the private sector.

The capacity of the MIPU and PWD to manage finances and undertake procurement \nactivities  for  large  development  projects  like  this  project  is  low.  The  government  plans  to \nestablish the VPMU before loan effectiveness as a dedicated unit for managing large and \nnationally significant projects with allocation of budget and core staff. The VMPU will need \nsignificant capacity building in financial management in general, and specifically in applying \nADB\u2019s disbursement policies and procedures. Institutional and structural reform of the PWD is \nunder way with AusAID assistance, which will improve institutional capacity. The project will \nengage financial management and accounting experts to support the VPMU. The MFEM will \nprepare an anticorruption strategy and action plan for the project, and establish a complaint \nmechanism.  The  VPMU  steering  committee  will  have  an  oversight  role  to  ensure  good \ngovernance of the project. \n \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  MFEM,  MIPU,  and  PWD.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (footnote 11). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n25.  Vanuatu\u2019s United Nations Development Programme human development index rank is \n126 out of 177,16 which is mid-range among its neighboring Pacific island nations. The high \nurbanization rate of Port Vila at 4.2% indicates a need for increasing quality services, including \n                                                \n13 Operation and Maintenance Approach for Port Vila Urban Development Project Assets (accessible from the list of \nSupplemental Documents in Appendix 2). \n14 The preliminary estimate of O&M expenditure for project roads and drainage infrastructure is $400,000 based on \n2% of investment costs; this will be confirmed during detailed design stage. \n15 An analysis of the estimated expenditure and revenue of the municipality-managed multipurpose, multi-user \nfacilities suggests that these units will realize significant net income, provided the user charge collection system is \nimproved to ensure transparency and plug leakages, if any. \n16  United Nations Development Programme.  2009.

The project will contribute to poverty reduction and socioeconomic development in the \nproject area by improving urban infrastructure such as sanitation, roads, drainage, public toilets, \nand bathing facilities along with associated community hygiene capacity development. The \nproject  will  improve  health  status  and  access  to  social  services  for  the  disadvantaged \npopulation, such as people living in settlement communities, women, and people with disabilities \nin the project area.17  \n27.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  It  will  take  into  account \nwomen\u2019s preferences for construction of roads and drainage systems and communal sanitation \nfacilities in the urban and periurban settlements, including their administrative role in project \nimplementation. The project will empower women through capacity development activities. A \ngender action plan has been prepared for this project.18 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment.  The  project  is  categorized  environmental  category  B.  The  initial \nenvironmental  examination  was  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009).19 The initial environmental examination found potential impacts to include \nshort-term  traffic  congestion  during  construction,  damage  to  beaches  and  coastal  erosion \ncaused by inappropriate sourcing of sand and other construction materials, and increased \nsediment loading and discharge of pollutants during operation. All required mitigation measures \nare defined in detail in an environmental management plan, and include adherence to accepted \nstandards in engineering design, following best practices during construction and O&M, and \ngiving due attention to climate change considerations, which will result in the project being \nclimate-proofed. The incremental cost of climate-proofing and mitigating emissions from the \nSTP is about $2 million. The government\u2019s assessment and clearance procedure is compatible \nwith ADB\u2019s environmental safeguard requirements.  \n29.  Involuntary  resettlement.  The  project  is  classified  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement. A resettlement plan has been prepared for the sludge treatment facility, which \nrequires acquisition of 6.5 hectares of land. The rehabilitation of the road and drainage network \nis not expected to require acquisition of land. As all works will be undertaken within existing road \ncorridors, a resettlement framework has been prepared to address any impacts that may arise \nduring implementation. The community sanitation facilities will be located on the land of the \nrespective communities and due diligence under the project preparatory technical assistance \nconfirmed that there will be no land acquisition and resettlement issues. The resettlement \nframework and resettlement plan have been endorsed by the government and posted on the \nADB website.20 \n \n30.  Indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  category  C  for  indigenous  peoples. \nMelanesians comprise the vast majority of Vanuatu\u2019s population. The project is not expected to \nimpact any distinct and vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined under the Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement.  It  will  be  ensured  that  local  communities  receive  culturally  appropriate \nbenefits, actively participate in the project, and do not suffer any adverse impacts. \n                                                \n17  Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).   \n20  Resettlement Framework and Resettlement Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9\n \nF.
