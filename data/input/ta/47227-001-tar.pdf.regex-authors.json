The Government of Myanmar recognizes that skills development is critical in promoting \ninclusive growth and poverty reduction, assisting Myanmar to meet rapidly evolving labor market \nneeds, rebalancing and equipping the labor force and the economy to modernize and advance \ntechnologically  into  higher  value-added  sectors,  and  enhancing  equity  of  access  to  new \nopportunities. Under the Comprehensive Education Sector Review (CESR)\u2014initiated by the \ngovernment  in  July  2012,  with  harmonized  support  from  development  partners\u2014the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has been a lead partner supporting analysis and policy dialogue on \ntechnical  and  vocational  education  and  training  (TVET)  and  other  post-primary  education \nsubsectors  in  Myanmar.  Building  on  dialogue  under  the  CESR,  during  the  2013  country \nprogramming mission, the government requested ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) to \npilot test new skills development models and provide related capacity development and policy \nand planning support. TA reconnaissance and fact-finding discussions (1\u20133 July and 16\u201320 \nSeptember 2013) reached agreement on the TA design, including the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost  estimates  and  financing  arrangements,  and  consultant \nterms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Myanmar\u2019s  socioeconomic  transformations  present  opportunities  and  challenges. \nRecognizing that an educated population and skilled workforce is a prerequisite for successful \nnavigation of these transformations and for sustained economic growth and poverty reduction, \nthe government has stepped up efforts to bolster the education sector, including the TVET \nsubsector.2 Myanmar\u2019s  ongoing  CESR  is  playing  a  critical  role  in  pinpointing  gaps  and \nidentifying \u201cquick wins\u201d (interventions that can deliver results quickly) to be pilot tested for scale-\nup under the forthcoming costed education sector plan (CESP). To be developed in the final \nphase of the CESR in 2014, the CESP will provide a unified framework for evidence-based, \nprioritized, and sequenced sector investments by the government and development partners.3   \n \n3.  Despite its large and young workforce, Myanmar faces significant skills shortages and \nmisalignment.  Analysis  supported  by  ADB  under  the  CESR\u2019s  rapid  assessment  (phase  1) \nshows an inverted skills pyramid. Amid overall gaps in skilled labor, young workers with basic \nskills are urgently needed to strengthen the foundations of the skill pyramid. Household survey \ndata suggest that only 1.7% of 16\u201319 year-olds are enrolled in various forms of skills training, \nwith access to training largely limited to affluent urban populations and niche skill areas such as \nthose related to computers and languages.4 Only 0.3% of rural males and 0.1% of rural females \nin that age group reported enrolment in any form of industrial, mechanical, or primary sector-\nrelated training, with virtually no poor respondents enrolled.5 Women (especially in rural or peri-\n                                                \n1  The ADB vice-president, Operations 2 approved the TA concept paper on 2 September 2013. The TA first \nappeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 October 2013.  \n2  In addition to national development, rapid retooling of the workforce will be critical to support Myanmar\u2019s successful \nentry into global markets and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Economic Community in 2015. \n3  The CESP is expected to include (i) a two-year plan covering FY2014\u2013FY2015; and (ii) interim planning for \neducation sector investments over FY2016\u2013FY2021, to be integrated into the national multisector sixth five-year \nplan. \n4  Participation rate estimates are based on ADB-supported CESR analysis of the 2009\u20132010 Integrated Household \nLiving  Conditions  Survey.  See  http://www.adb.org/projects/documents/cesr-p1-rapid-assessment-annex-\nsecondary-education-tacr \n5  Shares of 20\u201325 or 26\u201330 year-old rural males and females reporting they have completed training in such fields \nare only marginally (if at all) higher.    \n ", "2   \nurban areas) are particularly underrepresented in these types of skill training.6 The absence of \nworkers with foundational skills undermines the ability of more highly-skilled workers to function \nefficiently, and obstructs balanced modernization in both the urban and rural sectors.    \n \n4.  CESR analysis also highlights the lack of capacities and systems for providing applied \nshort courses and other forms of training accessible to disadvantaged youth and workers. Public \nsector TVET provision in Myanmar has focused on advanced, multiyear degree or diploma \nprograms, with admission based on the same matriculation exam used for university entrance.7  \nPrivate training is expanding, but remains limited and heavily targeted at more affluent urban \nniche markets (e.g., computer and language training). The TVET subsector also faces quality \nand management issues, which need to be addressed to support Myanmar\u2019s socioeconomic \ntransformation.  These  include  the  need  for  TVET  to  shift  from  a  supply-side,  academic \norientation toward demand-driven and competency-based programs, while addressing gaps in \n(i) the  quality  and  relevance  of  curricula  and  materials,  methodology,  and  overall  program \ndesign in the face of shifting demands; (ii) links to labor market needs, especially in expanding \nsectors and skill areas; (iii) instructional and managerial staff capacity and professional support \nsystems, in addition to physical facilities; and (iv) related institutional capacities. TVET has \nreceived very limited international support, as development partner project, policy, and other \nsupport to education remains concentrated in primary, preprimary, and nonformal education.8 \n \n5.  To help address these challenges, phase 1 of the CESR recommended (i) continued \nanalysis and policy support under CESR phase 2 (in-depth analysis) in areas such as the \ndevelopment  of  an  updated  policy  framework  for  TVET;  and  (ii)  more  focused  quick  win \ninterventions. Such interventions include the formulation and pilot testing of competency-based \nmodular  short  courses  (CBMSCs).  The  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology  (MOST)  and \nMinistry of Industry (MOI)\u2014key agencies in TVET and the CESR\u2014have sought ADB support to \ndevelop CBMSCs and strengthen their capacities in areas such as responsiveness to employer \ndemands.9 New to Myanmar, CBMSCs would provide a mechanism to quickly expand the \nsupply  of  foundational  skills  urgently  needed  to  modernize  Myanmar\u2019s  urban  and  rural \neconomies  while  advancing  equity  and  inclusive  growth  by  extending  skills  development \nopportunities to disadvantaged youth and workers who are unable to access higher education \nand existing forms of TVET. Complementing policy-level support under the CESR, the proposed \nTA will assist the government in operationalizing this quick win intervention by developing and \npilot testing CBMSCs in several urgently demanded skill areas, and building related institutional \ncapacities. Support under the TA is expected to feed back into the CESR, by providing proven \nmodels that can be integrated into the 2016\u20132020 sub-plan of the CESP and be replicated to a \nbroader array of skill areas and institutions under MOST, MOI, and other agencies.10 \n                                                \n6  Female enrolments are largely concentrated in computers, languages, and hospitality, where they appear to at \nleast marginally outnumber male trainees. Female participation in fields like welding is extremely limited. \n7  Taken at the end of grade 11, this exam is the basis for both certification of high school completion and selection \nfor higher education and some forms of TVET. Since 2009, about 66% of exam takers have failed, blocking access \nto many education and skills training pathways.    \n8  Limited development partner project support to date has focused on advanced, typically multiyear TVET programs. \nDevelopment partners supporting CESR TVET analysis have included ADB, German development cooperation \nthrough GIZ, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The Japan International \nCooperation Agency is also engaged in the CESR and plans continued support related to engineering disciplines.  \n9  MOST is the lead agency for TVET in Myanmar, in cooperation with the Ministry of Education (which has a \nmandate for sector-wide policy making and oversees the CESR) and other agencies. \n10 The TA will also promote a strategic thrust identified in Myanmar\u2019s Framework for Economic and Social Reforms  \non overhauling TVET to ensure alignment with market demands and trends. \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be an enhanced skills foundation for balanced and inclusive growth. The \noutcome  will  be  models  for  equipping  disadvantaged  young  adults  with  job-ready,  highly \ndemanded skills demonstrated to be successful and adopted.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The  TA  will  have  three  roughly  sequential  outputs:  (i)  institutional  structures  and \ncapacities  strengthened,  (ii)  high-quality  program  content  developed  and  delivered,  and \n(iii) evidence disseminated and replication models prepared. \n \n8.  Output 1: Institutional structures and capacities strengthened. The TA will support \nactivities  to  build  the  institutional  capacity  of  MOST  and  MOI,  other  key  agencies,   and \nparticipating training institutions to support pilot testing (para. 9) of CBMSCs, ensure that the \npilot test feeds back into broader policy dialogue and reform processes, and provide a stronger \nbase for expansion and replication of models demonstrated to be successful.11 Support will \ninclude  strengthening  the  management  capacities  of  agencies  and  participating  institutions \nthroughout the skills development cycle, including engaging the private sector in assessing local \nlabor markets; and identifying skill and competency demands, trainee recruitment, final skill \ncertification, and job placement for graduates.12 The output will also support MOST and MOI in \ndeveloping strategies, operational guidelines, and assessment frameworks for CBMSCs.  \n \n9.  Output 2: Competency-based modular short course (CBMSC) program content \ndeveloped  and  delivered.  The main cluster of activities under output 2 will focus on  the \npreparation and pilot testing of CBMSCs in three MOST government technical high schools and \ntwo MOI industrial training centers selected to participate in two parallel pilot tests.13 The MOST \npilot test will cover government technical high schools in Mandalay, Naypyitaw, and Yangon; \nand  focus  on  four  CBMSCs  on  building  and  construction.14 The  MOI  pilot  test  will  cover \nindustrial training centers in Mandalay and Pakokku, and focus on three CBMSCs on welding \nand small rural-use machinery.15 For each CBMSC, support will include (i) the development of a \ngender-sensitive curriculum and learner assessment mechanisms, based on engagement with \nlocal employers to pinpoint skill gaps; (ii) capacity building for instructors; (iii) provision of the \nrequired equipment and materials; and (iv) technical support for program delivery. At least 1,000 \ntrainees will successfully complete CBMSCs, which will be up to 3 months in duration and \nprovide training certificates, allowing trainees to enroll in CBMSCs successively and be certified \nin multiple skill areas (e.g., different types of welding) to diversify their skill sets. The TA will also \nsupport  interventions  to  promote  (i) access  by  young  adults  from  poor  and  disadvantaged \nfamilies, and (ii) females\u2019 participation in skill areas typically dominated by males.16 The second \n                                                \n11 These include, in particular, the National Skills Standard Authority. \n12 Recruitment efforts (including local social marketing) will largely target disadvantaged groups, including school \ndropouts and young adults who have not completed high school, while tackling gender biases.   \n13 Training institutions and CBMSC focus were selected largely based on pressing skill gaps in key economic zones. \n14 The MOST CBMSCs will focus on road construction and concrete technologies, cement shuttering, bar-bending \n(for concrete reinforcement), and bricklaying.  \n15 The MOI CBMSCs will focus on MIG-MAG welding; arc welding; and maintenance and repair of farm equipment, \nmotorcycles, and other common machinery. Additional CBMSCs in linked skill areas may be added under the \nMOST and/or MOI pilot tests during the second half of TA implementation.  \n16 CBMSCs will be free of charge, while the TA and government contribution will support basic accommodation and \nfood for trainees from rural areas. Per the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1), at least 250 females will \n ", "4   \ncluster of output 2 activities will support MOST and MOI in developing libraries of print and \nelectronic resource materials\u2014distilling from international best practice models of short courses \nin skill areas critical to Myanmar\u2014as well as further capacity building for core officials and staff \nto support the development of a broader array of CBMSCs for rollout after TA completion.   \n \n10.  Output 3: Evidence disseminated and replication models prepared. Support under \noutput 3 will include (i) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of both pilot tests, including limited \nbaseline and endline studies focused on local skill gaps faced by employers, and a small tracer \nstudy to assess trainees\u2019 ability to find employment; (ii) development of knowledge products and \nother  materials,  as  well  as  multi-stakeholder  dialogue  and  dissemination  of  findings  and \nrecommendations  relevant  to  CBMSC  replication  and  broader  policy  formulation;  and  (iii) \nanalytical and capacity development support to MOST and MOI to promote post-TA replication \nof CBMSC models.17 Linked to ADB support under the CESR, this will include support to MOST \nand MOI to develop costed models for replication in the form of projects to be included in the \n2016\u20132020 sub-plan of the CESP. The TA will also distill international experience on cost-\nsharing models and other cooperation with the private sector, identifying options for Myanmar.18  \n \n11.  Risks. The risk of a reversal in Myanmar\u2019s political and socioeconomic policy reforms or \nof  the  new  government\u2019s  commitment  to  strengthen  the  education  sector  appears  low.19 \nSimilarly, government ownership of the TA is very strong, as the introduction of CBMSCs is a \nhigh priority. Risks and challenges include those related to government institutional capacities \nas well as coordination across public and private sector stakeholders. TA interventions will seek \nto build capacities, including those linked to coordination and dialogue with employers and other \nstakeholders. Through the CESR, the education sector has been recognized as the leading \nexample of intra-government coordination and development partner harmonization in Myanmar. \nThe TA will benefit from linkages to the CESR process, including dissemination of findings and \ndialogue toward the replication of CBMSC models in institutions under other ministries. The TA \nwill not involve any significant adverse environmental or social impacts. CBMSCs pilot tested \nduring the TA will utilize existing facilities and be free of charge, so costs will not discourage \nparticipation. Overcoming traditional norms on gender roles will pose a challenge, but MOST \nand MOI are committed to promoting gender equity. M&E will carefully track implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,500,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff (including trainers at the participating \npilot institutions), meeting venues and work space for consultants and ADB missions, training \nclassrooms  and  venues  and  other  costs  of  fee-free  training  provided  during  the  TA, \nadministrative support, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \n                                                                                                                                                       \nsuccessfully complete CBMSCs during the pilot test, including at least 125 in CBMSCs in non-traditional skill areas \n(those typically dominated by males). \n17 While the pilot test\u2019s small scale will preclude a more rigorous and precise impact evaluation, quantitative analysis \nunder the M&E strategy will include a difference-in-difference approach to measure relative changes in employer-\nreported shortages in skill areas covered by the CBMSCs and comparator skill areas not covered under the pilot.    \n18 In the Myanmar context, public training institutions are expected to play a key role in provision of training for more \ndisadvantaged groups (with most private providers focused on more affluent urban niches) in the immediate future.    \n19 This is reflected in the government\u2019s launch of the CESR (following presidential endorsement in July 2012) as well \nas a tripling of the education budget in the last 2 fiscal years. \n ", "  5 \n13.  The TA will finance (i) expert inputs (para. 15), (ii) equipment needed to support the pilot \ntesting of CBMSCs, (iii) costs of training activities and other workshops, (iv) print and electronic \nresource materials and minor computer equipment to support resource material libraries at \nMOST and MOI, and (v) other allowable expenditures as agreed by ADB (Appendix 2).20  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  MOST  will  be  the  executing  agency.  Two  implementing  agencies\u2014the  MOST \nDepartment  of  Technical  and  Vocational  Education  and  the  MOI  Human  Resource \nDepartment\u2014will oversee two parallel pilot tests to be implemented in participating training \ninstitutions (para. 9). The TA will be implemented from April 2014 to April 2016. To support \nimplementation  and  replication,  MOST  will  establish  and  chair  a  TA  advisory  committee, \nincluding representation from MOI, the National Skills Standard Authority, other agencies, and \nindustry representatives.21 To facilitate implementation of training and other workshops and \nactivities, an advance payment facility will be established for MOST.22 MOST and MOI will \nprocure locally available items (such as hand tools, materials and supplies, and minor computer \nequipment) subject to prior approval and in accordance with ADB procedures. ADB will procure \nmore complex equipment required for CBMSCs (e.g., welding apparatus).23 In all cases, ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time), \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), and other ADB guidelines will \nbe followed.  \n \n15.    The TA will support 43 person-months of international consultants (four positions) and \n22 person-months of national consultants (one position) with expertise in relevant types of TVET. \nOutline  terms  of  reference  and  key  deliverables  are  in  Appendix  3.  ADB  will  engage  the \nconsultants as individuals in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). The international expert on skills development will be the overall \nlead consultant, leading development of the TA\u2019s M&E strategy and an overall knowledge plan \nfor disseminating TA deliverables. The TA will also mobilize short-term resource persons to \nprovide expertise as needed for activities such as training of trainers and events. In addition to \nnational and local stakeholder dialogue (including with the private sector) and linkages with the \nCESR process, the TA will maintain dialogue and pursue knowledge sharing cooperation with \ndevelopment partners supporting TVET in Myanmar and other institutions in-country or abroad, \nparticularly in neighboring members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.24  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n \n16.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to the Government of Myanmar to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Skills Development for \nInclusive Growth.  \n                                                \n20  These will include resource persons, venue, materials and supplies, logistics, and other allowable costs. \n21  These  will  include  (among  others)  the  Ministry  of  Education,  Ministry  of  National  Planning  and  Economic \nDevelopment, and Ministry of Labor, Employment and Social Security.  \n22  The ADB team leader provided in-depth orientations on ADB guidelines during reconnaissance and fact-finding. \n23  TA-financed equipment will be dedicated for TA use, and turned over to MOST and MOI after TA completion. The \nADB TA supervising unit will ensure close consultation on procurements with the Office of Administrative Services, \nOperations Services and Financial Management Department, Controller\u2019s Department, and other offices. \n24  In addition to development partners\u2019 support for the CESR, this will include and planned Japanese support to \nMOST to develop highly-skilled engineers, focused on technological universities in Yangon and Mandalay. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact  By end of 2020:     Assumptions  \nEnhanced skills  Share of 20\u201325 year-olds who  Fourth IHLCS round (with  No major reversal or \nfoundation for  have completed some form of  data collection expected to  disruption of political, \nbalanced and  training in fields related to  commence in 2019 and be  economic, and social policy \ninclusive growth   industry, mechanical repair, and  completed in 2020); data  reforms \nmachinery operation rises by at  from the MOLESS, MOST,   \n \nleast 5 percentage points in rural  and MOI  Continued rapid growth of \n  and urban areas (baselines 0.2%    total government revenues \nin rural areas and 1.3% in urban    and government prioritization \nareas in 2009), among males and    of education sector \nfemales (baselines 0.8% for males    development yield continued \nand 0.2% for females), and    rises in budgetary resources \namong the poor (baseline 0.0%) a      for TVET   \n     \nPolicy framework, strategy, and    Risk \npriority investments for a demand- Policy decrees; approvals  Breakdown of dialogue \ndriven national TVET system that  and implementation  processes (including under \nis equipped to meet evolving labor  reporting for CESP and  CESR) linking multiple \nmarket needs adopted and  national five-year plan,  agencies, private sector, and \nimplemented   2016\u20132020; annual reports  other stakeholders to \nof MOST, MOI, and other  advance TVET subsector \nagencies  reforms  \n \nOutcome  By April 2016:    Assumptions \nModels for  Final M&E findings on successful  MOST and MOI comments  Pilot findings and \nequipping  CBMSC implementation endorsed  on TA project\u2019s M&E final  recommendations endorsed \ndisadvantaged  by MOST and MOI  report  by senior MOST and MOI \nyoung adults with      leaders \njob-ready, highly  Strategies, operational guidelines,  MOST and MOI decrees   \ndemanded skills  and assessment frameworks  and reports  Timely intra-government \ndemonstrated to  approved by MOST and MOI to    approvals of CESP, and \nbe successful  guide development and    MOST and MOI budget \nand adopted   implementation of CBMSCs  proposals  \n \nnationwide, targeting   \ndisadvantaged groups and    Risks \npromoting equitable opportunities    Breakdown of mechanisms \nfor males and females     for coordination across \n    agencies and institutions \nExpansion of CBMSCs reflected  CESP (disseminated by  involved in the pilot test as \nin CESP and included in MOST  Ministry of Education);  well as other key \nand MOI budgets for FY2016  MOST and MOI annual  stakeholders (e.g., NSSA, \nreports; approved budget  private industries) \nfigures   \nBreakdown of linkages \nbetween CESP preparation \nand broader national \nplanning processes  \n \nOutputs   By April 2016:    Assumptions \n1.
