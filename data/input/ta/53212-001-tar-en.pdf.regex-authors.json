INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the efforts of the \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to build livable cities \nthat are green, competitive, inclusive, and resilient by applying innovative and integrated solutions \nin project development, design, and execution.1 Under the One ADB approach, the TA team will \nwork in close collaboration with various sector and thematic groups, and operations departments \nof ADB and DMCs to capture knowledge of planning, implementing, and operating livable cities.  \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 and its Operational Plan for Priority 4: Making \nCities More Livable, 2019\u22122024, which aims to improve the coverage, quality, efficiency, and \nreliability of services in urban areas; strengthen urban planning and the financial sustainability of \ncities; and improve the urban environment, climate resilience, and disaster risk management of \ncities.2 It is being developed in close consultation with ADB operations departments and has been \nsupported by the Urban Sector Group Committee (comprising of directors from the operations \ndepartments). Additionally, it will build on lessons from previous activities of ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments,  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change  Department,  and  urban \ndevelopment initiatives at other multilateral development organizations.3 The TA is included in the \nManagement-approved 2019  results-based  work  plan  of  the  Sustainable  Development  and \nClimate Change Department. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Urbanization and deficient services. Urbanization, especially in developing countries, \nis one of the most significant global trends that will define the future. The urban population in Asia \nand the Pacific increased from about 20% of the region\u2019s population in the 1950s to about \n48% in 2018, and is projected to be about 55% or 2.5 billion people in 2030.4 Cities have high \npotential to act as catalyst for economic development, contributing about 70% of the region\u2019s \ngross  domestic  product.  Urbanization  is  often  linked  to  improved  economic  opportunities, \nincreased access to health and education services, and better living conditions.5 At the same time, \ncities face the challenges of uncontrollably rapid rates of urbanization, growing infrastructure \n                                                \n1   A generally understood concept for a city to become more livable is to apply an integrated planning approach to the \nprovision of infrastructure and services and other public goods based on economic competitiveness, environmentally \nsustainable growth, social and financial inclusion, and resilience. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities \nsection of ADB\u2019s website on 26 April 2019. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila; ADB. 2019. Strategy 2030 Operational Priority 4: Making Cities More Livable, 2019\u20132024. Manila.  \n3  The TA team will consider lessons from similar city action plans and TA projects from ADB and other development \norganizations, including but not limited to the following:  \n  ADB. 2019. Creating Livable Cities: Regional Perspectives. Manila.  \n  ADB. 2019. Technical Assistance to Georgia for Preparing Integrated Solutions for Livable Cities. Manila. \n  ADB. 2016. GrEEEn Solutions for Livable Cities. Manila.  \n    ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance for Promoting Smart Systems in ADB\u2019s Future Cities Program. Manila.  \n  ADB. 2015. Technical Assistance for Establishing the Future Cities Program in the Asia and Pacific Region. Manila.   \n  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance for Green Cities\u2013A Sustainable Urban Future in Southeast Asia. Manila. The main \nlessons include selecting cities and projects with real potential, focusing on the development of cities\u2019 internal \ncapacities, and employing multisectoral and cross-thematic approaches, among others. The TA team will also study \nother urban initiatives by multilateral development organizations such as the European Bank of Reconstruction and \nDevelopment\u2019s Green City, Inter-American Development Bank\u2019s City Lab, and Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development\u2019s City Innovation.   \n4  United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. 2018.

Manila. \n \n ", "2 \ndeficits, increasing risks of climate change and disasters, environmental stress, traffic congestion, \naging societies, growing inequality, violence and crime, uncertainties associated with rapid \ntechnology advances, and emerging threats such as cyberattacks and terrorism. As of 2016, \n523 million people across Asia and the Pacific live in informal settlements with poor services, \n260 million people have no access to safe drinking water, and 1.7 billion lack basic sanitation.6 \nMoreover, the region\u2019s cities discharge 80% of the wastewater they generate into water bodies \nwithout primary treatment, while the region is expected to generate 1.8 billion tons of waste per \nyear by 2025.7   \n \n4.  Weak urban planning, institutions, and governance hurt delivery of infrastructure \nand  services.  Cities  in  DMCs  need  to  build  adequate  institutional  capacity  for  planning, \nimplementing,  and  operating  urban  infrastructure  and  services,  and for  solving  their  urban \nproblems. Further, cities and urban regions, particularly small and medium-sized cities and towns, \nfrequently face governance challenges, including weak institutional structures, overlapping legal \nand regulatory frameworks, lack of coordination, blurred administrative boundaries, corruption, \npoor public services, lack of own-source revenue, and capacity constraints, despite the increasing \nlevel of decentralization. Implementation often takes place in the cities while the decisions are \nmade at higher levels, leading to suboptimal problem solving. Mobilizing citizens, partners, and \nother stakeholders for planning, design, and implementation helps build inclusive governance \nsystems for people-centered and needs-based livable city solutions.  \n \n5.  Financial sustainability of service provision and urban improvement projects needs \nto be achieved. Urban infrastructure finance is often challenged by the absence of creditworthy \nentities, opaque credit structures, insufficient own-source revenues, and poor cost-recovery \nmechanisms compounded by the reluctance of the governments and urban agencies to levy user \ncharges. The key local sources of revenue, such as property taxes, publicly owned assets, \nand licenses remain underutilized or undeveloped, while many DMCs are facing debt limits and \nother financial constraints. Robust financial management systems and fundamental tools such as \na cadaster system, property registry, and utility metering system need to be strengthened.   \n \n6.  Weak understanding of smart systems or applications of digital technology as a \ncritical component in urban solution provision. Cities in DMCs lack adequate expertise in \nsmart8 systems or digital technology such as network systems, information and communication \ntechnology, Internet of Things9, and the use of sensors, which generate tremendous opportunities \nfor enhancing efficiency, economy, and impact when they are thoughtfully implemented with \nurban infrastructure and service delivery. Such solutions also support city governance and \nengagement  with  citizens  and  other  stakeholders.  Moreover,  data  analytics  and  artificial \nintelligence  help  cities  understand  their  strengths,  weaknesses,  and  opportunities  for \nimprovement,  while  facilitating  data-  and  evidence-based  decision-making.  Proven,  new, \nand emerging digital technologies provide unprecedented opportunities for cities to leapfrog to \nthe level of developed cities and achieve transformation rapidly and efficiently.    \n \n7.  Poor  livability  affects  competitiveness,  and  lack  of  competitiveness  impacts \nlivability. A competitive city creates large markets; acts like a magnet attracting investments, \n                                                \n6   Informal settlement figure corresponds to urban, while water supply and sanitation correspond to urban and rural.  \n7   ADB. 2016.

Nairobi.  \n8  \u201cSmart\u201d in the context of urban development refers to the use of new technologies and digital solutions. \"Innovative \nsolution\" therefore is a larger term that includes smart technology.  \n9  The interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and \nreceive data without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. \n ", "3 \nknowledge, talent, skills, and management; and generates new ideas, well-paying jobs, economic \nopportunities,  and  wealth.  The  competitiveness  of  cities  goes  far  beyond  the  provision  of \ninfrastructure and public services and includes an enabling environment to attract investments in \nmanufacturing and services necessary to create and sustain dynamic markets and generate jobs \nfor the increasing labor force. Poor livability discourages entrepreneurship, employment, creativity, \nand innovation, and deters investments in and opportunities for cities to act as economic engines \nthat bring long-term productivity and stability.   \n \n8.  Transformative  opportunity.  ADB\u2019s  Strategy  2030  and  Operational  Plan  for \nPriority 4: Making Cities More Livable (footnote 2) provide an opportunity to help cities become \nmore livable. For cities, \u201clivability\u201d may be defined differently based on their stages of development \nand long-term vision. Nevertheless, for citizens, aspirations for opportunities to improve the quality \nof life and standards of living are universal. Urban space, which embodies unlimited opportunities \nfor human advancement, is innately complex, calling for efforts to increase livability through \nintegrated  solutions,  which  require  multisector  and  cross-thematic  approaches,  adequate \ninstitutional capacities, and sound governance systems.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  urban  livability  in  DMCs  improved \n(footnote 2). The TA will have the following outcome: integrated and innovative urban solutions \npromoted.10 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Plans for enhancing livability in select cities developed. This will include  \n(i) capturing and structuring knowledge of past and ongoing operations in select cities in DMCs \nto inform the design of future projects for livable cities, (ii) developing inclusive and gender \nresponsive city action plans for achieving long-term goals, and (iii) producing recommendations \non innovative methodologies for city action plans and ways to mainstream such methodologies in \nADB operations. The TA team will produce the plans in the form of livable city action plans \nleveraging various available frameworks and methodologies based on long-term goals, the \nassessment of current needs, and available resources.11 The plans may include a mix of various \ncomponents such as infrastructure and service provision; institutional strengthening, capacity \ndevelopment,  and  knowledge  management;  planning,  governance,  and  finance;  use  of \ntechnology and digital solutions; and climate resilience and disaster risk management systems. \nThe TA team will conduct the selection of five cities and specific interventions in close consultation \nwith the ADB operations departments based on criteria such as active ADB presence, strategic \nimportance to ADB operations, strong government will for  integrated and innovative urban \nsolutions, geographic balance, and city size (e.g., secondary cities).12  \n                                                \n10  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n11  City action plans may be developed in the form of smart city action plans, green city action plans, transit-oriented \ncity action plans, localizing Sustainable Development Goals action plans, low-carbon urban transformation action \nplans, inclusive city action plans, competitive city action plans, among others, which are appropriate for the selected \ncities. \n12 The TA team will attempt regional balance. However, eight DMCs (Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, \nPakistan, Philippines, and Viet Nam) supported by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund will be prioritized \nwhile other DMCs will be supported by E-Asia Knowledge Partnership Fund.  \n \n ", "4 \n11.  Output  2:  Asian  Development  Bank  projects  incorporating  integrated  and \ninnovative urban solutions for selected cities supported. This will include support for selected \ncities in DMCs to incorporate integrated and innovative livability solutions in ADB\u2019s ongoing or \nnew projects in cross-sector and cross-thematic areas such as climate change, education, energy, \nenvironment, finance, gender, health, heritage conservation and sustainable tourism, housing, \nsmart systems, social protection, transport, and water.13 The TA team will select projects that \n(i)  are  directly  linked  to  the  Operational  Plan  for  Priority  4:  Making  Cities  More  Livable \n(footnote 2); (ii) include integrated components; (iii) contain innovative solutions; (iv) include smart \ndigital solutions; (v) incorporate inclusive and gender-responsive approaches and (vi) have \npotential for generating knowledge solutions for replication and informing future project design or \nimplementation. The TA team will determine the projects to support under this output in close \nconsultation with the ADB operations departments. \n \n12.  Output 3: Knowledge and capacities of select cities on livability improved. This will \ninclude capturing lessons and good practices from the implementation of various ADB projects \non livable cities, including projects under outputs 1 and 2. The scope includes capacity building \nof key stakeholders in DMC cities to enhance urban livability and sustainability of integrated and \ninnovative urban solutions through sharing of best practices and diverse methodologies. The TA \nwill  support the  preparation  of knowledge  products  in the  form  of  publications, guidelines, \nmultimedia products, and presentations and dissemination of knowledge through knowledge \nevents, online and offline vehicles, and other means. The TA team will also encourage and \ndocument city-to-city learning.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.5 million, of which (i) $2.0 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis  by  the  Urban  Climate  Change  Resilience  Trust  Fund14 under  the  Urban  Financing \nPartnership Facility and (ii) $0.5 million will be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea \ne-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund, both to be administered by ADB. The key expenditure \nitems are listed in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer this TA and will be the executing agency. The Urban Sector Group \nunder the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department will be responsible for the \nadministration and supervision of the TA. ADB will engage international consultants and national \nconsultants and actively engage its operations departments in producing the outputs.  \n   \n                                                \n13  Possible activities include analytical and technical work, due diligence and project preparation, and support for \ndeveloping concepts for integrated and innovative solutions to existing or planned projects.
