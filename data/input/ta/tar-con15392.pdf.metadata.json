INTRODUCTION\n1. In a rapidly changing global economic environment, it is vital for the Asian Development\nBank (ADB) to keep abreast of development issues and take the lead in formulating appropriate\npolicies to assist its developing member countries (DMCs). ADB must play a catalytic role,\nbringing  together  other  partners  to  help  the  DMCs  address  fundamental  problems  of\ndevelopment and poverty. As stated in its Long-Term Strategic Framework, ADB is in a unique\nposition to link the region\u2019s DMCs to the larger global context, support the development process,\nspur economic growth, and promote inclusive social development. To do this, ADB needs to\nhave up-to-date information as well as projections and forecasts for the medium term. One of\nthe  important  lessons  learned  from  the  Asian  economic  crisis  (1997-1998)  is  that  timely\ninformation promotes understanding of development trends and helps in designing appropriate\nresponses. It is with this objective in view that the Asian Economic Outlook (AEO) workshop\nwas conceptualized in 1989. Since then, the workshop has been an annual feature of ADB\nactivities.\n2. Among  other  things,  the  AEO  workshop  is  designed  to  contribute  to  the  Asian\nDevelopment Outlook (ADO),1 which is one of ADB's flagship publications, as well as to the\nADB annual report. The AEO workshop is organized annually and has become a valuable forum\non recent economic performance and medium-term prospects of DMCs.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. To be able to identify and recommend relevant and useful policy measures to its DMCs,\nADB must have adequate knowledge of the most recent developments. A significant part of\nsuch knowledge is generated by internal analysis and research. However, it is important to\nmonitor and synthesize the findings of other research and financial institutions in the region and\nmultilateral organizations, and discuss the relevant issues affecting the economic outlook of\nAsia and the Pacific region. This technical assistance2 (TA) enables ADB to hold the AEO\nworkshop, where selected development issues are discussed. It also supports the preparation\nof special country studies and theme papers.\n4. More specifically, the AEO workshop updates the recent macroeconomic performance of\nDMCs, and projects their medium-term prospects. Given the timing of ADB's annual report,\nrelevant statistics and reports generated under this TA also support the regional highlights\nchapter of the annual report.\n5. The  AEO  workshop  contributes  substantially  to  ADB's  visibility  in  the  academic\ncommunity, at international research institutions, and among multilateral organizations. The\nworkshop has evolved as a valuable public relations exercise among bankers, financiers, and\neconomic policymakers in the region. The 14th AEO workshop incorporates several novel\nfeatures  that  will  enhance  its  impact.  Internally,  the  ADO  workshop  provides  a  venue  for\neconomists in ADB\u2019s operations and research departments to exchange views and evolve a\ncommon understanding of policy issues relevant to the Asia and Pacific region.\n                  \n1  The ADO is distributed annually by the Oxford University Press and about 3,000 copies are sold commercially in\naddition to the complimentary copies distributed by ADB. The ADO is extensively reviewed and commented on by\nthe media.\n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in February 2001.", "2\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n6. The  TA  will  support  an  extensive  discussion  and  review  of  the  Asian  and  Pacific\neconomies. It will comprehensively assess the global economic outlook. It aims to identify\nsalient policy issues and a broad macroeconomic operational strategy for the region. Selected\ncountry  studies  and  theme  papers  will  be  prepared,  which  in  turn  will  serve  as  technical\nbackground  papers,  and  will  feed  into  the  ADO,  ADB's  annual  report,  and  other  periodic\npublications and updates. The TA will support these and related activities. The TA framework is\ngiven in Appendix 1.\nB.  Scope\n7. The TA will have four components. First, it will support the AEO workshop at ADB\nheadquarters  to  discuss  the  emerging  economic  outlook  and  selected  themes.  Other\ninstitutions, including the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, will be invited to give\npresentations on the regional and global economy. ADB\u2019s own prognosis will be presented and\ndiscussed. Second, discussions on selected thematic issues will feature noted panelists from\nthe  academe;  policymaking  community  in  the  DMCs;  and  the  private  sector,  notably  from\nbanking and the financial world. Well-known scholars and professionals will present individual\npapers on the issues of immediate relevance to the region. Third, the TA will support the\npreparation  of  selected  data-based  country  studies  analyzing  recent  (2001)  economic\nperformance and medium-term (2002-2003) prospects of selected DMCs. Fourth, the TA will\nsupport outlook dissemination activities, in collaboration with ADB's resident missions.  To reach\na wider audience and to take advantage of Internet technology, an AEO web page will be\ndeveloped and selected papers will be posted on the web.\n8. The 14th AEO workshop has adopted many new features to reach a wider audience and\nachieve more thorough discussion topics. It also reflects several of ADB\u2019s corporate objectives\nin a more cohesive manner than in the past. The workshop will be organized by the Economic\nAnalysis and Research Division, and will present a program of the Statistics and Data Systems\nDivision, and the Project Economic Evaluation Division of the Economics and Development\nResource Center. In line with ADB\u2019s thrust toward decentralization, ADB\u2019s resident missions will\nalso be invited to participate. Ongoing research will be shown.  New features and advantages\ninclude (i) the proposed web site will expand access and participation to the workshop; (ii)\nmedia coverage will be improved for wider visibility; and (iii) a number of resource persons\n(policymakers, scholars, and business and DMC representatives) will be invited to support a\ncross section of views and elicit high-level expert opinion from participants. Therefore, the\nprogram has been expanded from 1.5 to 3 days.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n9. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $250,000 (Appendix 2). ADB will finance the TA\non a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program.", "3\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n10. The Economic Analysis and Research Division in the Economics and Development\nResource Center will implement the TA. The AEO workshop is scheduled for 16\u201318 October\n2001. As in previous years, the AEO workshop will be organized in close collaboration with the\nprograms departments and the Office of Pacific Operations. These collaborative arrangements\nwill be continued through to the preparation of ADO 2002 and other publications. About 15\nresource persons will be invited to (i) prepare country studies on selected DMCs, and (ii) make\npresentations on macroeconomic and financial issues at the AEO workshop. The resource\npersons will be identified and selected in consultation with economists from the programs\ndepartments and the Office of Pacific Operations.\n11. Domestic consultants will be engaged for about 26 person-months to (i) help monitor\ndevelopments in the DMCs and gather information on the selected themes; and (ii) design,\ndevelop, and maintain a web page for the AEO workshop and the ADO. The outline terms of\nreference  are  attached  as  Appendix  3.  The  consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in\naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants,  and  other  arrangements\nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants, using the biodata proposal\nprocedures for individual consultants.\n12. The ADO publication is scheduled to be launched in March 2002 in cooperation with\nselected resident missions. ADB staff will present major findings of the ADO to the media, DMC\npolicymakers, academic community, and opinion makers.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n13.
