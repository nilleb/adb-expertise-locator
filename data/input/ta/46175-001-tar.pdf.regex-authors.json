INTRODUCTION \n1.  Bhutan\u2019s Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2013\u20132018 prioritizes providing jobs for young people \nand  skilled  labor  for  the  growing  economy.1   In  addition  to  economic  and  employment \ndevelopment, meeting these  objectives  will  require technical  and  vocational  education  and \ntraining (TVET) graduates who are ready to contribute to priority sectors. \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the Government of Bhutan\u2019s capacity to \nplan and implement high-quality, relevant TVET throughout the public, private, and community \nsectors. It will support the government in (i) developing a blueprint for TVET, (ii) planning and \npiloting professional development measures to improve the quality and relevance of TVET, (iii) \nintroducing standards and a curriculum for a new or emerging skills area, and (iv) increasing the \ncapacity of community-run services to youth recovering from drug and alcohol dependency. The \nrequest  for  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  assistance  is  reflected  in  Bhutan\u2019s  country \noperations business plan, 2014\u20132016.2 The government has concurred with the inputs, outputs, \ncosts and financing arrangements, and the consultant terms of reference.3 This TA builds upon \nearlier ADB projects and prepares the way for the expansion of the skills development system.4 \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Bhutan is undergoing rapid political, social, and economic transformations. The country \ntransitioned  from  a  political  system  based  on  an  absolute  monarchy  to  a  democratic \nconstitutional monarchy in 2008. The economy grew at an average rate of 7.4% during the \nTenth Five-Year Plan, 2008\u20132013, which enabled the country to nearly halve the incidence of \npoverty.6 Economic growth slowed to 5.3% in FY2013 from 6.5% a year earlier, mostly because \nof credit and import restrictions imposed in 2012 to alleviate the balance of payment deficit with \nIndia, that resulted in an Indian rupee liquidity shortage. Growth is expected to rebound in 2014, \ndriven primarily by hydropower and tourism. \n \n4.  Rapid growth has created challenges. Industry in Bhutan faces persistent shortages of \nskilled  labor,  as  well  as  mismatches  between  labor  supply  and  demand.  The  difficulty  in \nsecuring appropriately skilled labor has been identified as a critical development constraint for \nBhutan. 7  Hydropower,  construction,  and  tourism\u2014the  sectors  contributing  most  to  the \neconomy\u2014have job vacancies because insufficient numbers of young people have the technical \nqualifications needed to fill them. In addition, many employers see a poor fit between young \nworkers  and  jobs.  Expatriate  workers  fill  the  gaps,  with  many  young  Bhutanese  not  yet \nappreciating the value of aligning education and employment with areas of economic growth. \n \n                                                \n1  Government of Bhutan, Gross National Happiness Commission. 2013.

Bhutan: Critical Development Constraints. Manila. \n ", "2 \n \n5.  While  sections  of  industry  have  shortages  of  appropriately  skilled  workers, \nunemployment  among  young  people  in  Bhutan  is  high  and  increasing.  Nearly  half  of  the \npopulation is under 25 years old. Although the overall unemployment rate in Bhutan in 2012 was \n2.1%, unemployment among youth was 7.3%, with young women constituting 60% of that \ngroup.8 For many, especially young women, employment prospects do not improve as their \neducational levels increase.9 Appropriate career counseling, industry-relevant training, and job \nguidance are essential.  \n \n6.  Youth have become increasingly disengaged from the labor market. Without satisfying \nwork in the new economy or in the old agricultural economy, youth alienation is leading to \ngrowing social problems including crime and drug and alcohol dependency. The community and \nthe government are increasingly concerned by this trend, which is at odds with traditional values. \nThe services available to youth recovering from drug and alcohol dependency are limited and \nneed support. The National Youth Policy 2010 urges development in which the lives, work, and \nsuccess of young people are placed at the center of growth and development.10 \n \n7.  The educational foundation in Bhutan is strong. The Millennium Development Goals for \nbasic education have been achieved, as has gender parity in primary education. The completion \nrate  for  higher  secondary  education  is  increasing,  and  the  government  is  committed  to \nreorienting education and training to better meet the needs of its growing economy and the \naspirations of its young people. These are notable achievements for a small, landlocked country \nwith a population of only 730,000. Until the early 1960s, Bhutan had only 400 students enrolled \nin  school  education  at  any  level.  By  2012,  about  8,000  students  passed  final  grade  12 \nexaminations. Those who progress to university study at home or abroad. Young people aspire \nto civil service and administrative jobs, and their education and training choices reflect these \naspirations. However, because such jobs are limited, a growing number of educated youth in \nBhutan miss out on civil service and other administrative jobs, and therefor require redirection \nand support into alternative careers. \n \n8.  The government is committed to developing flexible and effective responses. The skills \ndevelopment system in Bhutan has fundamental facilities and systems in place, especially as \nregards occupational standards, competency-based training, and quality assurance. Recently, \nthe available training has been diversified. Still, the sector has not kept pace with need. Skills \ndevelopment is seen as a one-off event, not a lifelong process. Retraining of young adults and \ncurrent workers, distance education, and e-learning techniques are underdeveloped. Enrollment \nacross the 13 public TVET institutes managed by the Ministry of Labour and Human Resources \n(MOLHR) is extremely low at 1,800 students, of whom about 30% are women.11 Only 3 of the \n13 public TVET institutes have enrollments greater than 200 students. Few have effective \nlinkages with employers. In addition to 27 registered private providers, some CSOs offer basic \nlivelihood and life skills development courses to targeted communities through partnerships with \nthe government. The formal public TVET subsector is operating at under capacity, although a \nthorough assessment has not been done. Formal TVET has the following characteristics: (i) low \n                                                \n8  Government of Bhutan, Ministry of Labour and Human Resources. 2012.

Formal TVET courses are mostly in occupations \ndominated by men. \n ", "3 \ninterest from Bhutan\u2019s youth; (ii) uneven quality, narrow range, and outdated programs; (iii) poor \nfit between skills developed and job opportunities; and (iv) insufficient engagement of industry \nand community. The immediate challenge is to increase the quality and relevance of TVET and \nto communicate opportunities to youth in order to increase enrollments and effectiveness within \ncurrently underutilized institutes. \n \n9.  With support from  bilateral  development  partners,  the government  is  reviewing  and \nupgrading training in two industry sectors. The TA will apply a similar methodology to plan the \nrenewal of an additional sector.12 The government has already partnered with selected private \nsector  providers,  and  engagement  will  be  extended  during  the  TA  to  CSO  providers  as \nappropriate. Engagement with the Chamber of Commerce and with local employers will be \nsought to gain industry insights and model ways of inclusive industry involvement. Strategies to \nmodernize, extend, and expand skills development are necessary in many areas. The TA will \nsupport the MOLHR with new directions, innovative approaches, and interventions in line with \nthe deliverables of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. Outputs from the surveys and development \nwork will influence the development of a comprehensive blueprint for TVET. The TA is in line \nwith ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS) for Bhutan, 2014,13 which aims to support the \ncountry\u2019s efforts towards inclusive growth. The TA is also in line with the Midterm Review of \nStrategy 2020.14 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved relevance of TVET. The outcome will be improved capacity \nof MOLHR to guide skills development initiatives. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will support this outcome through the following four outputs: \n \n(i)  Output  1:  Technical  and  vocational  education  and  training  blueprint \ndeveloped. This output will assist the government review and revise its approach \nto TVET. Analysis and additional research will be undertaken to establish an \nevidence  base  for  planning  and  to  provide  baselines  against  which  future \nprogress can be measured. Areas to be covered will include skills gap analysis, \nfinancial  analysis,  training  institute  facilities  audit,  and  training  institute  staff \ncapacity assessment as well as surveys of student aspirations and employer \nexpectations. Results and findings will be disseminated and incorporated into the \ncollaborative  development  of  a  TVET  blueprint.  The  blueprint,  which  will  be \nclosely aligned with government policies and strategies, will provide the basis for \nannual strategic plans. \n \n(ii)  Output  2:  Professional  development  plan  for  technical  and  vocational \neducation  and  training  staff  piloted.  This output will help the government \n                                                \n12 The two sectors are (i) electrical, with support from the Government of Japan; and (ii) building and construction, \nwith support from the Government of Switzerland. Those projects provide comprehensive support including \nequipment upgrades, whereas the TA will focus on planning the renewal of training programs and piloting specified \nelements. \n13 ADB. 2014.

Manila. \n ", "4 \n \nimprove the quality and relevance of TVET by offering professional development \nfor TVET  trainers,  boosting job-placement  capacities  within  technical  training \ninstitutes, and establishing links with organizations in Japan and around Asia with \nparticular expertise. A comprehensive plan for professional development of TVET \nteachers will be developed and selected aspects piloted across the network of \ntechnical  training  institutes.  Staff  from  private  and  CSO-run  service  delivery \nproviders will also be included in activities as appropriate. \n \n(iii)  Output 3: Standards, curriculum, and learning materials for priority skills \ndeveloped. This output will help the TVET subsector prepare for a future with \nmore young people working in new and emerging industries. The final choice of \nindustries  will  be  determined  at  the  start  of  the  TA.  Early  advice  from  the \ngovernment indicates a preference for jobs in environmental or sustainability \nindustries, or for a specialized segment of high-growth industries or services. \nStaff from private and CSO-run service delivery providers will also be included in \nactivities as appropriate. \n \n(iv)  Output 4: Improved capacity for delivery of community-run youth services. \nThis output will strengthen CSO capacity to deliver services to youth recovering \nfrom  drug  and  alcohol  dependency.  It  will  provide  planning  and  capacity \ndevelopment to the Bhutan Youth Development Fund to support its transition to a \nnew facility at Tshaluna. This will be achieved through the development of an \nagency-specific service delivery master plan and operations manual, as well as \nsupport for strategic planning, financial management, human resource planning, \ncapacity development planning, communication and marketing, and development \nof delivery standards and indicators for service quality. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $875,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of (i) remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff, \nincluding secretarial services as required; (ii) office accommodation and supplies; (iii) domestic \ntransportation; (iv) government data and studies for consultants\u2019 use; and (v) other in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The MOLHR will be the executing agency for the TA. A small project management unit \nwill be established within the MOLHR\u2019s Department of Human Resources to carry out day-to-\nday TA implementation. The MOLHR will assign counterpart officers with relevant technical \nexpertise for key aspects of the TA. These counterpart officers will work with the TA consultants \nto support two-way knowledge transfer. The TA will be implemented over 24 months from \nSeptember 2014 and to August 2016. The outcomes of the TA will be disseminated through \npublications and workshops, and the government has committed to consider the TA outputs for \nongoing improvement of skills development. \n \n14.  A total of 69 person-months of consulting inputs will be provided under the TA: 15 \nperson-months of international consultant services and 54 person-months of national consultant \nservices. ADB will engage two individual experts (for 23 person-months) on individual consultant \nselection  basis.  ADB  will  engage  an  international  firm  or  international  nongovernment \n ", "5 \norganization on the basis of quality-based selection with simplified technical proposal to provide \nproject  implementation  support.  The  international  firm  or  international  nongovernment \norganization will provide 29 person-months of consulting inputs from October 2014 to June 2016. \nADB will also engage a national firm on the basis of consultant\u2019s qualifications selection, with \nsimplified technical proposal, to provide research and communication services. The national firm \nwill  provide  consulting  inputs  from  December  2014  to  June  2016.  All  consultants  will  be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in  Appendix  3.  All \ndisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All TA-financed goods and \nequipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2013,  as \namended from time to time). The procured equipment will be handed over to the MOLHR upon \nTA completion. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 to the Kingdom of \nBhutan to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Institutional \nStrengthening for Skills Development, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact   By end of 2018:  MOLHR statistics  Assumption \nImproved relevance  90% of TVET graduates  Continued economic \nTracer study reports \nof TVET  employed within 4 months  growth in the sectors \nfrom TVET institutes \nof graduation  prioritized for TVET \n(2013 baseline: 65%) (sex  redevelopment \ndisaggregated)   \nRisks \nSlow change in \nperception among \nstudents, parents, and \nindustry regarding the \nvalue of TVET \n \nLimited resources \nallocated to TVET \n \nOutcome   By end of TA project for all  Assumption \n \nImproved capacity of  indicators:  TVET providers are \nMOLHR to guide  Government agreement to  Final TA report  responsive to the \nskills development  TVET sector blueprint    initiatives of MOLHR \ninitiatives \n  Curriculum for five new  Final TA report \nskill areas endorsed by \nMOLHR \n   \nOutputs  By mid-2016 for all    Assumption \nindicators:  Private sector \n1.
