The proposed Sustainable Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Development Program, \ncomposed of (i) a policy-based loan (PBL) and (ii) a project loan to Georgia, is aligned with the \ngovernment\u2019s pursuit of more sustainable water supply and sanitation (WSS) services and state-\nowned enterprise. The policy actions under the PBL will support governance and institutional \nreforms to improve performance and financial sustainability, while ensuring funding for basic \nservices during a period of fiscal constraints brought on by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic. The project will (i) improve a critical and procurement-ready water supply system in \nTelavi, a strategically important city for job creation and economic growth,1 (ii) strengthen the \noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  capacity  of  United  Water  Supply  Company  of  Georgia \n(UWSCG),2 and (iii) prepare for national-scale rural WSS investments.  \n \n2.  The PBL will strengthen sector governance and institutions,1 and the project loan will \nincrease the operational efficiency of WSS systems. The total program cost is estimated at \n$153.5 million. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will finance $150.0 million using its ordinary \ncapital resources, and the government will provide $3.5 million in counterpart support. The ADB \nfunds will comprise (i) a $130.0 million PBL (stand-alone with two tranches), and (ii) a $20.0 million \nproject loan. ADB will finance 100% of adaptation and mitigation costs. The program supports the \npriorities identified in ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023, and is listed in its country \noperations business plan, 2020\u20132022 for Georgia.3 This technical assistance (TA) is not listed in \nthe business plan. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  Many cities throughout Asia and the Pacific face difficulties ensuring continuous water \nsupply. The main problems are aging infrastructure\u2014investment has been insufficient to replace \ndeteriorating  assets\u2014and  lack  of  operational  budgets  to  fund  much-needed  maintenance. \nPhysical assets such as pipes, valves, pumps, wells, and treatment facilities deteriorate over time, \nadding to the cost of O&M, while also making it more difficult for utility operators to maintain a \nhigh level of service and meet customers\u2019 expectations. An asset management system (AMS) is \na proven technology to enable more efficient management of assets and thereby prolong their \nlife. Although AMS for water supply systems is commonplace in many developed countries, water \nsupply utilities in developing member countries seldom operate an AMS.  \n \n4.  Strategy 2030 acknowledges that better management and maintenance of infrastructure \nassets are essential and sets the course for ADB to help strengthen the capacity of developing \nmember countries to reduce life-cycle costs and maintain their infrastructure assets by using \nadvanced technology.4 \n \n1  Telavi is the capital of the Kakheti Region, and has a population of about 20,000. Water supply is critical for wine \nand agricultural production, and for tourism in Telavi. Most of the famous wine producers are in Telavi. More than \n70% of households in Telavi use water tanks and reservoirs, and 30% purchase water. \n2   UWSCG is a limited liability company established in January 2010 and owned entirely by the state. It provides WSS \nservices to urban settlements across the country, except for the municipalities of Tbilisi, Mtskheta, Rustavi, and \nGardabani, and Adjara Autonomous Republic. UWSCG has more than 2,700 employees, 10 regional offices, and \n51 service centers. \n3  ADB. 2019.

The TA will support the project component of the proposed program. The program concept \npaper was approved on 1 June 2020. The program is expected to be implemented from 2020 to \n2024. The TA will help develop and operationalize a sustainable AMS for the water supply \nservices in selected cities in Georgia. It is an innovation for the country. The TA covers AMS \nreview and benchmarking; hardware and software procurement; AMS installation, which includes \npopulating it with data; and capacity building.  \n \n6.  An operational AMS (including software license and hardware) will be implemented in \nselected cities where UWSCG provides services, for their continued use. The AMS will be fully \npopulated using available data (electronic and paper), supplemented by knowledge elicitation \n(eliciting the knowledge from experienced operational field staff), and data infilling (techniques for \nfilling in data gaps based on existing data). Where necessary, asset data surveys (including a \ncondition assessment survey) will be commissioned. Annual support maintenance of the AMS \nlicense will be provided for 3 years. \n \n7.  The main aim of the TA is to demonstrate to UWSCG and the cities the benefits of a state-\nof-the-art  AMS  for  water  supply  services.  The  expected  benefits  for  UWSCG  are  that  it \n(i) understands its water supply network better, (ii) makes better operational and maintenance \ndecisions, (iii) achieves more effective maintenance planning, and (iv) ensures the financing of \nasset rehabilitation or replacement. This will result in an extended asset life span, a reduction in \nnonrevenue water, and an increase in operational efficiency, which will improve the reliability of \nwater supply systems. Other benefits include valuing the assets, providing the necessary data to \nbuild  hydraulic  models,  planning  maintenance  workload  allocation,  and  improving  financial \nperformance. \n \n8.  The TA will also help build the capacity of UWSCG staff to operate the AMS, to ensure \nthat the system is sustainable and will continue to be used by UWSCG service centers or regional \noffices. In addition, the TA team will support the preparation of a knowledge product that can \nshowcase the AMS technology and its realized benefits, as well as lessons from its use, to other \nwater supply utilities. The knowledge product will be disclosed and will be a reference material for \nthe future development of other knowledge products. The TA will also support two knowledge \nevents at ADB headquarters in Manila to disseminate the AMS-related realized benefits and \nlessons to ADB staff because these insights are expected to be applicable to other infrastructure \nprojects,  such  as  wastewater,  stormwater,  drainage,  and  irrigation  systems,  or  roads.  The \nsuccess of the AMS demonstration will be monitored and the findings fed into the program \ncompletion report.  \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: improved reliability of water supply systems \noperated by UWSCG. The TA will have the following outcome: effective maintenance of UWSCG \nassets using an AMS increased.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Proprietary asset management system for water supply benchmarked. \nSpecialist consultants will be engaged to undertake a market review of commonly used and \ncurrently available AMSs for water supply services, review the advantages and disadvantages of \noff-the-shelf versus custom-made AMSs, and compile a long list of AMSs for water supply \nsystems. The AMSs in the long list will be reviewed for functionality against the current and future \nrequirements of typical water utilities in developing member countries, and specifically for the \nselected utility. The AMS functionality will be benchmarked against the required functionality. The \n ", "3 \nreview will include the assessment of AMS life-cycle costs, e.g., for the license and for ongoing \nannual support maintenance, and the sustainability of the cost structure for utilities in developing \nmember countries. In consultation with ADB, the consultants will then compile a short list of AMSs \n(three at most) for water supply services. They will carry out an in-depth review of the functionality \nand lifetime costs of the shortlisted AMSs and recommend to ADB the most appropriate, cost-\neffective, and sustainable one for the selected water utility in Georgia. The AMS benchmarking \nconsultant will prepare draft and final (digital) AMS benchmark reports. \n \n11.  Output 2: Asset management system populated and implemented. ADB will engage \na specialist AMS consultant to lead the implementation of the selected AMS for water supply in a \ncity (or two) in Georgia. The consultant will develop specifications for dedicated AMS hardware, \nand  will  procure  the  hardware  as  well  as  the  AMS  software  license,  and  annual  support \nmaintenance (3 years) for the AMS. The AMS will be populated with water supply asset data from \nelectronic or hardcopy drawings, and knowledge elicitation from utility staff members. Asset gaps \nand asset condition will be determined by surveys. Infilling techniques will be used for the \nremaining gaps. The specialist will carry out asset rehabilitation and replacement programming \nand prepare a financing plan. \n \n12.  Output 3: Knowledge of the benefits of asset management technology enhanced. \nThe  AMS  benchmarking  consultant  will  lead  a  remote  AMS  knowledge  event  at  ADB \nheadquarters. The AMS implementation consultant will lead a second remote AMS knowledge \nevent at ADB headquarters. Together, the consultants will prepare a (digital) knowledge product \non AMSs for water supply for ADB operations.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $225,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the High-\nLevel Technology Fund5 and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 1. \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff and office \naccommodation. The government was informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA and will be the executing agency. The Urban Development \nand Water Division of its Central and West Asia Department will implement the TA and be \naccountable for the TA outputs. It will carry out administration and supervision, implementation \noversight, and communication with consultants and stakeholders.  \n \n16.  The Water Sector Group Secretariat under the Sector Advisory Service Cluster of ADB\u2019s \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department will provide support and resource \npersons  in  close  coordination  with  the  program  officer.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  from \nNovember  2020  to  December  2021.  The  TA  resources  will  be  disbursed  following  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).
