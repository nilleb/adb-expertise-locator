INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the study and \nthe promotion of the implementation of market conduct supervision in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) that is integrated within the framework for financial consumer protection. The TA will \nexpand upon the TA to the PRC for Promotion of a Legal Framework for Financial Consumer \nProtection, completed in September 2015 that established a framework for financial consumer \nprotection and supported cooperation among the various government stakeholders. 1  \n \n2.  The TA is listed in the 2017\u20132019 country operations business plan for the PRC.2 \nFollowing a fact-finding mission in May 2017, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the \ngovernment reached an understanding on the objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, \ncosts, and terms of reference for the TA.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The impacts of global financial crisis in 2008 highlighted the need for more effective \nfinancial consumer protection measures as consumers face more sophisticated and complex \nfinancial  markets,  products  and  services.  New  product  developments,  financial  service \ninnovations, and technological advances including the rise of financial technology (FinTech) has \nincreased dramatically and raised the need to improve the capacity and protection of financial \nconsumers in using and accessing finance.4 Building and maintaining consumer confidence and \ntrust in financial markets promotes efficiency and stability and helps to create positive outcomes \nfor both financial institutions and their customers. Consumers need knowledge, information, and \nsecurity  to  enable  them  to  fully  participate  in  financial  markets  and  make  sound  choices. \nAdditionally, there needs to be a strong framework of supervision over the providers of financial \nproducts and services to consumers through the imposition of market conduct supervision.5  \n \n4.  There are four approaches to financial regulation depending on the degree of integration \nof market conduct supervision and financial consumer protection with prudential supervision. \nUnder one supervision model, consumer protection and market conduct, including review of \nbusiness practices, are carried out by separate regulatory agencies from those responsible for \nprudential regulation.6 While no two jurisdictions regulate financial institutions and market conduct \nin the same manner, the models adopted worldwide can be divided into four categories: (i) the \ninstitutional approach, (ii) the functional approach, (iii) the integrated approach, and (iv) the \u201cTwin \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013.  Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Promotion of a Legal Framework for Financial \nConsumer Protection. Manila. \n2   ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan, People's Republic of China, 2017\u20132019. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB's website on 12 August 2017. \n4   Financial Technology or \u201cFinTech\u201d can be described as the industry of generally non-bank institutions that uses new \ntechnologies such as the internet, artificial intelligence, mobile services, and other innovations to provide financial \nservices directly to consumers more rapidly and in competition with the delivery channels of financial products and \nservices by traditional financial institutions such as banks. \n5  Market conduct supervision is an element of financial consumer protection that focused on the behavior of financial \ninstitutions to ensure they do not perform distortive or abusive practices and that appropriate information disclosure \nis provided to consumers when they utilize financial services.  \n6   Prudential regulation refers to both macro-prudential and micro-prudential supervision. Macro-prudential supervision \nrefers to the oversight of financial stability and systemic financial system concerns while micro-prudential supervision \nrefers to the direct oversight of the practices of banks and financial institutions.   \n ", "2 \nPeaks\u201d approach.7 An evolving practice structure for this oversight is the so called \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d \napproach of financial regulation.8 No pure example of any approach exists. The specific way in \nwhich  regulation  and  supervision  has  been  structured  in  each  country  reflects  the  unique \nindividual  history,  politics,  culture,  financial  sector  size,  economic  development,  and  local \nstructures.  The  PRC  is  currently  following  the  institutional  approach  in  that  the  regulatory \nauthorities  have  been  established  along  institutional  or  sector\u2010based  lines  and  separate \nauthorities have been established to regulate the banking, insurance, and securities sectors.9 \nWithin this context, each of the PRC\u2019s financial regulators have also established their own \nindividual units for financial consumer protection. The China Securities Regulatory Commission \ncreated one in December 2011, and China Insurance Regulatory Commission in November 2011, \nwhile the China Banking Regulatory Commission in 2012. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) \ncreated the Financial Consumer Protection Bureau (FCPB) in June 2012. Each entity is generally \nresponsible for supervision of financial consumer protection within its own mandate.  \n \n5.  As the PRC\u2019s financial system has become more complex and integrated, the need for \nstructural reform has grown particularly with regards to financial consumer protection and market \nconduct. A reform agenda is outlined in the 13th Five-year Plan for the Development and Reform \nof  the  Financial  Industry.10 Regarding  consumers,  the  agenda  supports  financial-inclusion \nprograms, supporting use of technological innovation, supporting lending in rural areas and to \nsmall and micro enterprises, and improved consumer and investor protection through stronger \nsupervision and greater disclosure. The financial sector has become increasingly integrated and \nthe lines between traditional banking, securities, and insurance have become blurred. Further, \nnon-traditional institutions have become successful in offering financial products and services and \nthese offerings are often under-regulated. The institutional approach in the PRC is facing the need \nto accommodate these financial sector changes. There is greater need to protect financial \nconsumers  by  further  clarifying  the  relationship  between  market  conduct  supervision  and \nprudential supervision.  \n \n6.  There is a strong link between protecting financial consumers from abusive products and \npractices,  and  safety  and  soundness  of  financial  system. Consumer  confidence  and  trust \npromotes financial stability, growth, efficiency, and innovation in the financial system over the long \nterm. It is within this context that the PBC has decided to strengthen market conduct supervision \nwithin their financial consumer protection framework. The need exists to ensure consumers are \ntreated fairly when seeking and using financial products and services. Improved protection \n                                                \n7  The institutional approach is a legal-entity-driven approach. The firm\u2019s legal status essentially determines which \nregulator is tasked with overseeing its activity both from a safety and soundness and a business conduct perspective.  \nOversight in the functional approach is determined by the business that is being transacted by each entity without \nregard to its legal status. In the integrated approach, there is a single regulator that conducts both safety and \nsoundness oversight and conduct-of-business regulation for all the sectors of the financial services industry. The \nprior UK Financial Services Authority was the prime example of this model.  The Twin Peaks approach is based on \nthe principle of regulation by objective and refers to a separation of regulatory functions between two regulators: one \nthat performs the safety and soundness supervision function and the other that focuses on conduct-of-business \nregulation including financial consumer protection.  \n8   The Twin Peaks approach was adopted in Australia in 1998 with the creation of the Australian Prudential Regulatory \nAuthority that regulates banks, building societies and credit unions, life and general insurance and reinsurance \ncompanies, friendly societies and superannuation funds, investment banks and finance companies. The Australian \nSecurities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and the Australian Securities Exchange regulate market conduct \nand ASIC also has responsibility for market integrity and consumer protection. \n9  The China Banking Regulatory Commission supervises banks; the China Insurance Regulatory Commission \nsupervises the insurance industry; and the China Securities Regulatory Commission supervises securities markets \nalong with other industry groups. \n10  The 13th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development of the People\u2019s Republic of China (2016\u20132020) \nBeijing. http://en.ndrc.gov.cn/policyrelease/201612/P020161207645766966662.pdf \n ", "3 \nultimately benefits overall financial market development and stability also being a core mandate \nfunction of the PBC. The method chosen and implemented must address three core concerns: (i) \ninsufficient information that limits the ability of consumers to make sound decisions on financial \nproducts and services; (ii) the risk of abusive practices due to limited competition and a lack of \ntransparency; and (iii) barriers to the development of appropriate financial products and services \nthat can properly serve and fulfill the needs of the poor, the rural population, and small businesses.  \n \nB.  Proposed Solutions \n \n7.  It is necessary in the PRC to further strengthen the approach to consumer protection and \nmore effectively incorporate market conduct supervision in financial services to create a more \nresilient and stable financial system. The PBC is planning to evaluate the various methods for \nimplementing market conduct supervision and proposing a new path for its integration within the \nrole of the PBC and financial consumer protection. At this stage, the TA will assist the PBC to \nevaluate the current domestic situation and concerns, seek the alternatives with their benefits and \nlikelihood for a best fit with local circumstances, and propose a roadmap that can be followed for \nimplementation. Solutions will propose adoption of methods in line with international financial and \ncodes of practices that solidify commitments of the PRC as a member of the G-2011 and are \nconsistent with recommendations in the 2011 Financial System Stability Assessment Report12 \nprepared by the IMF and those in the 2015 Peer Review of China prepared by the Financial \nStability Board.13 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Financial system regulatory reform and \naccountability deepened.14 TA will have the following outcome: financial consumer protection \nstrengthened.15 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n9.  Output 1: Framework on market conduct supervision in financial services prepared. \nThe output will seek a framework to enhance oversight of market conduct within the role of the \nPBC and supporting the adoption of international financial codes of practices. This output will \nsupport: (i) preparation of at least five detailed studies and reports that clarify the relationship \nbetween market conduct oversight and integration with financial consumer protection consistent \nwith the role and mandate of the PBC, (ii) completion of a roadmap that can be used as a guide \nfor the adoption and implementation of the selected best-fit model for market conduct supervision, \nand (iii) recommendations from reports and roadmap acknowledged by the PBC\u2019s FCPB and \nsubmitted to the Governor to support preparation of policy proposals on financial consumer \nprotection and a mechanism for market conduct supervision. A study tour will also be sponsored \nfor key management and staff from the PBC\u2019s FCPB to ADB member countries that have adopted \n                                                \n11 Group of Twenty is an international forum for the governments and central banks of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, \nCanada, PRC, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Republic \nof Korea, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States, and the European Union.  \n12 IMF. 2011.
