The \nADB  country  strategy  for  Viet  Nam  emphasizes  sustainable  economic  growth,  poverty \nreduction,  and  inclusive  social  development.  Power  sector  investments  to  achieve  annual \neconomic growth of more than 7% is a priority for the Government of Viet Nam. While large-\nscale power generation projects have contributed to economic growth over the past decade, the \nbenefits  from  this  growth  have  not  been  distributed  equitably.  People  displaced  by  power \ngeneration  projects  have  not  benefited  fully  from  the  economic  growth.  Moreover,  the \ninvoluntary resettlement caused by such projects often has impoverished them further. The \nGovernment has developed resettlement sites and livelihood programs for displaced people. \nHowever, due to the inadequate capacity of the authorities at the central, provincial, and district \nlevels,  resettlement  and  livelihood  programs  often  have  not  been  implemented  effectively. \nPeople  displaced  by  hydroelectric  power  projects  often  have  been  unable  to  restore  their \nlivelihoods. Livelihood restoration is often the weakest part of any resettlement plan. However, \nfor hydropower projects with significant displacement and loss of livelihood, the need for well-\ndesigned and effectively implemented livelihood programs is critical. \n2.  ADB is processing the Northern Power Transmission Expansion Sector Project (the \nProject) for approval in late 2005. The Project\u2019s transmission lines will evacuate power from \npower plants under construction in northern Viet Nam to load centers in Hanoi, Haiphong, and \nQuang Ninh. The 2,400-megawatt Son La Hydropower Project (SLHPP)1 and 560-megawatt \nHuoi Quang Hydropower Project (HQHPP) are considered associated facilities of the proposed \nProject. SLHPP will displace about 91,000 people, while HQHPP will displace 5,000. Therefore, \nthe proposed technical assistance (TA) will strengthen the institutional and technical capacity of \nnational, provincial, and district authorities, as well as commune leaders, for effective planning \nand implementation of resettlement and livelihood programs for the communities affected by \nthese facilities. The Resettlement Master Plan for SLHPP has been completed, and the district \nresettlement plans2 are being prepared. In June 2005, the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund \nendorsed the TA concept paper for funding.3  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Viet Nam\u2019s record in poverty reduction has been impressive in the past decade. The \nproportion of population living in poverty has declined from about 58% in 1993 to 29% in 2002. \nDespite this significant achievement, the reduction in poverty varies by region and ethnicity. \nAbout half of the ethnic minority population is poor. The northern upland region is the poorest of \nthe nine regions in Viet Nam. Lai Chau is the poorest province in the northern region with a \npoverty headcount of 77.7%, while Son La ranks third at 71.4%. Insufficient investment in \ndevelopment projects, as well as poor physical and social infrastructure, has limited poverty \nreduction in the northern region. In recent years, investments have been made to improve \nphysical  and  social  infrastructure,  and  to  develop  hydropower  projects  in  the  northern \nmountainous region. The Government is preparing new cycles of targeted poverty reduction \nprograms. In addition, the 2001\u20132005 Public Investment Program has increased the public \ninvestment allocation to the northern mountainous and northern central region provinces to \n                                                 \n1   The Government of Viet Nam is financing SLHPP and HQHPP. Construction of access roads, diversion of \nchannels, and river embankment protection have started for SLHPP. The resettlement of people displaced by \nSLHPP started in 2001 on a pilot basis. The resettlement plan is being prepared for HQHPP.  \n2  Eight district resettlement plans involve 270 resettlement sites. Preparation of detailed plans for each resettlement \nsite will continue until 2009.   \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 15 July 2005. \n ", "2   \n24.3% of the total, an increase from 20.3% during 1996\u20132000. The budget allocations to the \nGovernment\u2019s targeted programs associated with poverty reduction also were increased in the \nnorthern regions.  \n4.  Under SLHPP, relocation and resettlement of the displaced people will be completed by \n2009. Thus far, about 3,375 people have been relocated to pilot resettlement sites in three \nprovinces. The recent implementation review of the Government\u2019s resettlement plan in the pilot \nresettlement  sites4  identified  many  weaknesses  in  the  implementation  plan,  including  the \nlivelihood  program.  The  findings  included:  (i)  inaccurate  assessment  for  compensation, \n(ii) inadequate disclosure and planning of income restoration and livelihood program, (iii) tension \nbetween relocated people and host communities, and (iv) ineffective grievance mechanism. The \nlivelihoods of the relocatees, which have been disrupted by displacement, need to be restored. \nMost of the displaced people are ethnic minorities, predominantly Thai, from the provinces of \nDien Bien, Lai Chau, and Son La. \n5.  In 1998, the Government issued a decree (22/1998/CP) to regulate compensation and \nother allowances for land structures for national and public interest. Following this decree, a \nresettlement plan for SLHPP was prepared in the pilot provinces. Based on the lessons learned \nfrom the pilot, the Government issued a special decision (No 459/QD-TT) in May 2004, which \naddressed gaps in the earlier decree and provided measures to maintain the standard of living \nof the affected people. The Government has approved $687 million for the resettlement and \ncompensation  plans  and  livelihood  program  for  SLHPP.  Faced  now  with  the  challenge  of \nimplementing  large  and  complex  resettlement  plans,  the  Government  recognizes  its  weak \ninstitutional and technical capacity in planning and implementing such plans and livelihood \nprograms.   \n \n6.  The TA Fact-Finding Mission identified specific problems with the district resettlement \nplans and livelihood activities for the affected people: (i) inadequate implementation of the \nGovernment\u2019s special decision of May 2004 in the district resettlement plan and livelihood \nprograms;  (ii)  lack  of  proper  land  use  planning  in  selecting  resettlement  sites;  (iii) weak \nfeasibility study on the availability of adequate or suitable cultivable land for an appropriate \nupland  farming  system,  suitable  crops,  extension  and  marketing,  etc.,  for  the  livelihood \ndevelopment of the relocatees; (iv) inadequate attention to retaining the cultural and traditional \nway  of  life  and  subsistence  system  of  the  relocatees;  (v)  more  emphasis  on  building \ninfrastructure in the resettlement sites than on preparing livelihood programs for the relocatees; \n(vi) inadequate  consultation  with  the  affected  people  (relocatees  and  host  communities) \nregarding relocation, land acquisition, compensation, and retention of traditional way of living in \nthe resettlement sites; (vii) no specific grievance process established to address resettlement \nissues at the commune and district level for the affected people; and (viii) district resettlement \nand  compensation  management  committees  (DRCMC)  in  most  cases  do  not  include \nrepresentatives  from  the  District  Agriculture  and  Rural    Development  Division  and  Natural \nResource  Management  Division.  Rather,  most  members  of  the  committees  are  from  the \ninfrastructure division. In two districts, resettlement plans are linked to the urban development \nplan of the districts, which could complicate further the resettlement and livelihood programs of \nSLHPP. Further, the DRCMC does not have a representative from the Committee for Ethnic \nMinorities in Mountainous Area. Overall, the provincial resettlement steering committees and the \nDRCMCs  lack  the  institutional  and  technical  expertise  to  plan  and  implement  effectively \nresettlement and livelihood programs. Domestic consulting firms prepared the detailed district \n                                                 \n4  Viet Nam Son LA Hydropower Project: Resettlement Due Diligence Report, MKID/MKRD, May 2005. \n ", "  3\nplans, because of DRCMC\u2019s weak technical expertise. As such, the quality of the district plans \ncannot be ensured. \n \n7.  The  ethnic  minority  communities  in  the  affected  areas  depend  mainly  on  wetland \nagriculture. Since  the  proposed  resettlement  sites  are in  the  upland, a  change in  farming \nsystems from wetland agriculture to upland agriculture will be needed. Selection of resettlement \nsites  for  upland  farming  and  development  of  livelihood  program  will  require  (i)  significant \ntechnical skills of national and local authorities in land use planning; (ii) selection of farmland for \nupland agriculture; (iii) selection of suitable crops; (iv) management and sustainable use of \nnatural  resources;  and  (v)  assessment  of  capital  requirements  for  production,  agriculture \nextension services, marketing facilities, etc. For the affected people downstream, an income \nrestoration  program  will  require  technical  expertise  in  community-based  aquaculture \ndevelopment. A comprehensive review is needed of the Master Resettlement Plan, as well as \nthe district resettlement plans and livelihood programs. The aim is to (i) assess the selection of \nresettlement sites for appropriate livelihood development programs for the affected people; \n(ii) identify the institutional and technical capacity required at the national, provincial, district, \nand commune level for developing an effective resettlement plan and livelihood program; and (iii) \nidentify the gaps between Special Decision No 459/QDT and the district resettlement plans. \n \n8.  In 2001, ADB approved a TA grant5 to prepare a new decree on compensation and \nrehabilitation. The proposed TA will complement capacity building under TA 3727. However, \nwhile the proposed TA on SLHPP will be completed within two years, the resettlement and \nlivelihood  program  of  SLHPP  will  continue  until  2009.  The  capacity  development  training \nprogram of this TA for national, provincial, and district authorities from Son La, Dien Bien, and \nLai Chao provinces, as well as commune leaders, will increase their capacity in formulating and \nimplementing the resettlement plans and livelihood programs for SLHPP and HQHPP. The \noutputs of the TA will be used for the Project in the northern provinces, and for the proposed \nADB-supported Son Bung 4 Hydropower Project in Quang Nam Province in Central Viet Nam. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The long-term impact of the TA will be sustainable livelihood development programs for \nthe affected people of SLHPP and HQHPP. The outcome of the TA will be increased capacity of \nthe national, provincial, and district resettlement authorities, as well as grassroots stakeholders, \nfor  developing  appropriate  livelihood  programs  for  the  affected  people,  including  ethnic \nminorities.  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will (i) review the existing livelihood  system and proposed livelihood programs of \nthe  district  resettlement  plan  for  the  affected  people  (relocatees  and  host  communities); \n(ii) review  the  development  of  a  framework  and  operational  guideline  for  preparation  of \nlivelihood programs relevant to different ethnic groups, with specific focus on ethnic minorities, \nwomen, and other vulnerable groups; (iii) review the Master Resettlement Plan and district \nresettlement  plans  for  the  affected  people,  and  develop  a  comprehensive  framework  and \noperational guidelines for improving the district plans for SLHPP and HQHPP; (iv) develop \n                                                 \n5 ADB. 2001.

The review of Master Resettlement Plan and the district resettlement plans with the \nrelevant national, provincial, district, and commune leaders from the affected areas will help to \nformulate  an  appropriate  framework  and  operational  guidelines  for  improving  the  existing \nresettlement  plans  and  livelihood  programs  of  Son  La.  This  process  also  will  help  in  the \npreparation of effective resettlement plans and livelihood programs for the subsequent years of \nSLHPP  and  HQHPP.  The  capacity  building  training  program  will  focus  on  preparation  of \nresettlement and livelihood programs following the training needs assessment and operational \nguidelines prepared under the TA. The training program will focus on (i) effective consultations \nat  the  village  and  commune  levels  for  assessment  of  inventory  loss,  land  acquisition,  \ncompensation,  etc.,  relevant  to  ethnic  groups  and  gender;  (ii)  grassroots-level    planning, \nimplementation, and monitoring of resettlement activities and livelihood programs using the \nframework of  Decree 79 and Decree 80; (iii) selection of resettlement sites based on land use \nplanning for an appropriate farming system and sustainable income generation from farm and \noff-farm activities; (iv) planning of crops and extension services for an upland farming system; (v) \nmanagement of natural resources for sustainable use and income; (vi)  planning of farm and off-\nfarm activities for immediate and long-term income generation and capital requirements, and \nextension and marketing facilities, etc.; (vii) downstream aquaculture planning; (viii) selection of \nresettlement sites for suitable physical and social infrastructure; (ix) planning and coordination \nbetween livelihood programs in the resettlement sites and the Government\u2019s rural development \nand  poverty  reduction  programs;  (x)  development  of  an  appropriate  grievance  process  for \naddressing resettlement issues; (xi) monitoring system for resettlement and livelihood activities \nat  the  national,  provincial,  district,  and  commune  levels;  and  (xii)  monitoring  indicators \ndisaggregated by ethnic groups and gender. The increased capacity of the authorities at the \nnational,  province,  and  district  levels  will  facilitate  implementation  of  Special  Decision  No \n459/QD-TT as an effective resettlement and livelihood plan relevant to the livelihood system of \nethnic groups in the mountainous region.  \n                                                 \n6  TOT for selected staff from Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, National Institute for Agricultural Plan \nand Projection, Son La Power Project Management Board, Electricity of Viet Nam, and Power Engineering \nConsulting Company of EVN; provincial and district resettlement steering committees; DRCMCs, and selected \nleaders of district women\u2019s union, communes, and mass organizations. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The estimated cost of the TA is $1,250,000 equivalent, comprising $609,000 in foreign \nexchange cost and $641,000 equivalent of local currency cost. ADB will provide a grant of \n$1,000,000 from the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, covering the entire foreign exchange \ncost and $391,000 equivalent of local currency cost. The grant will be used for financing \ninternational  and  domestic  consultants,  including  (i)  preparation  of  guidelines  and  training \nmodules; and (ii) TOT and training of the national, provincial, and district authorities, as well as \ncommune leaders. The Government of Viet Nam will provide $250,000 equivalent for the TA, \nprimarily through in-kind contributions to cover accommodations, venue of training, counterpart \nsupport, transport and monitoring of the training, and TA implementation. ADB will administer \nthe TA. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  MARD will be the Executing Agency of the TA, facilitating implementation of the training \nprogram and monitoring TA activities. A national project director from MARD will head the \nproject office. Within MARD, a steering committee will be formed comprising representatives \nfrom  national  resettlement  committees,  Ministry  of  Finance,  Electricity  of  Viet  Nam,  and \nchairpersons of three provincial steering committees on resettlement and compensation. The \nsteering committee, which will play an advisory role, will meet every 6 months to review the \nprogress of the TA.    \n \n14.  International and domestic consultants will implement the TA. The TA will require 72 \nperson-months of consulting services, including 24 person-months of international consultants \nand 48 person-months of domestic consultants. The consultants will be recruited individually in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The terms of reference of the \nconsultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n15.  The TA, which will be implemented over 2 years, is expected to start in January 2006 \nand be completed in December 2007. The first 2 months will be used to select the consultants \nand prepare the start of the TA. The next month will focus on (i) review of district plans; (ii) visits \nto proposed resettlement sites; (iii) consultations with the government authorities, commune \nleaders,  and  affected  people;  and  (iv)  assessment  of  training  needs.  The  preparation  of \nguidelines for the resettlement plans and livelihood programs, and development of training \nmodules and TOT program for the relevant government authorities, commune leaders, and \nmass organizations, will be completed by October 2006. Training of the national, provincial, and \ndistrict authorities, as well as leaders of communes and mass organizations, will continue until \nOctober 2007.
