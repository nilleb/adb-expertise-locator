The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program 2007\u201320101 for the \nLao  People\u2019s  Democratic  Republic  (Lao  PDR)  made  future  support  for  strengthening  the \ncapacity of the, then proposed, Water Resources and Environment Administration (WREA) a \npriority.  Following WREA\u2019s formation in May 2007 as the Lao PDR water sector agency, ADB \nand  Agence  Fran\u00e7aise  de  D\u00e9veloppement  (AFD)  undertook  a  joint  fact-finding  mission  in \nOctober 2007 to formulate the technical assistance2 (TA), and a proposed realignment of AFD \nsupport from the water resources coordination committee (WRCC)  to WREA.3 The project \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The Government of the Lao PDR confirmed \nits concurrence with the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, and cost and \nfinancing arrangements of the TA in October 2007. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Lao PDR is the source of approximately 38% of the annual flow of the Mekong River. \nWithin the Mekong Basin, each riparian country4 perceives its future water-related opportunities \nand risks in very different ways, and each has quite different technical and financial capacities. \nManagement of the Mekong will increasingly require the riparian countries to address cross-\nborder issues, which in turn will demand strong national capacities to deal with complex water \nuse and resource protection issues. The future may require trade-offs that have been avoided \nso  far  due to  the  relatively  limited  development  of  the  water  resources  in  the basin.  The \nprojected challenges highlight the need for each country in the basin to have appropriate polices \nand capacities for water resource management.  \n \n3.  The ADB and the World Bank have collaborated since 2004 on the preparation of the \nMekong  water  resources  assistance  strategy  (MWRAS).5 MWRAS  was  developed  through \nanalytical work and strategic workshops carried out in 2004 and early 2005 with the national \ngovernments of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam. The MWRAS preparation \nwork confirmed that there is a need for extensive capacity-building in all aspects of IWRM in the \nregion to support the further investments required in water management.  \n \n4.  Relative to the challenges in the basin, the Lao PDR has lacked resources to develop \nthe  skills  and  experience  required  to  implement  integrated  water  resources  management6 \n(IWRM)  approaches  in  an  adequate  manner.  This  has  significantly  limited  its  ability  to  (i) \nmanage its own water resources strategically to ensure that the rapid development of water-\nrelated projects occurs in a balanced, and socially and environmentally acceptable way; and (ii) \nbe an informed and equal partner in the international negotiations that occur within the Mekong \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Lao People's Democratic Republic, Country Strategy and Program (2007-2011): Manila (September \n2006). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 November 2007. \n3  ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Nam Ngum River Basin Development Sector Project. Manila. (Loan 1933 for \n$15 million approved 11 November 2002). AFD approved parallel financing on 24 April 2004 as a grant of \u20ac4.3 \nmillion. AFD will realign support under component 1 of Nam Ngum project, from Water Resources Coordination \nCommittee to the newly established WREA, equivalent to about $2.3 million between October 2007 and April 2009 \nfor institutional development and support. WRCC is now absorbed in to the departments of WREA. \n4  The lower Mekong Basin countries are Cambodia, Lao PDR, Thailand and Viet Nam. Yunnan province of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, and Myanmar, also share the Mekong River resources. Each is dependent on the \nMekong water resources in different ways and to different degrees.   \n5  ADB and World Bank. 2006. Future Directions for Water Resources Management in the Mekong Region, Mekong \nWater Resources Assistance Strategy. Joint  working paper presented at Mekong Region Waters Dialogue: \nExploring Water Futures Together, Vientiane, 6\u20137 July. \n6  IWRM is a process that promotes the coordinated development and management of water, land, and related \nresources, to maximize the resulting economic and social benefits in an equitable manner without compromising \nthe sustainability of vital ecosystems \n ", "2   \nRiver Commission (MRC).7 Given that a large share of Mekong River flow originates in the Lao \nPDR, the potential is high for international disputes, as well as for internal inefficiencies, if \nresources are not managed well and in a principled way. \n \n5.  Water resources in the Lao PDR contribute significantly to the economy through support \nto irrigated agriculture and through growing hydropower revenues. Managing the competing \nuses of water and meeting international responsibilities in the shared resources of the Mekong \nincreases  the  need  for  effective,  national,  water  resources  management.  The  Lao  PDR \ngovernment adopted an integrated approach to sustainable water resources development in the \nearly 1990s, although it faced many constraints including inadequate institutional setup, limited \ntechnical capacity, inexperience of the agencies concerned in managing water resources, and \nlack  of  coordination  of  agencies  involved  in  the  water  sector.  With  ADB  support,  the \nGovernment  introduced  a  more  integrated  approach  for  water  resources  development  and \nmanagement with the enactment of the Water Resources Law (October 1996) followed by the \nestablishment of the Water Resources Coordination Committee 8 (WRCC) in August 1997. The \nWRCC has been the national authority and advisory body with a mandate to coordinate the \nplanning9, management, protection, and monitoring of water resources, but the regulations to \nimplement the law remain incomplete. \n \n6.  In 2006, the ADB and World Bank, with support from AFD and Australian Agency for \nInternational  Development,  undertook  further  studies  to  define  the  scope  of  an  IWRM \nstrengthening program in the Lao PDR.10 The study identified 10 major groups of activities \nnecessary to enable effective IWRM, which would take about 5 years to implement, at a cost of \nabout $9.0 million.  \n \n7.  During  2007,  the  Lao  PDR  initiated  further  steps  to  streamline  its  water  resources \nagencies and to modernize its water sector. Until recently, for example, water management was \nspread  across  nine  agencies;  the  Government  has  addressed  this  fragmentation  with  the \ncreation of the WREA, which has the mandate for all aspects of IWRM (Appendix 2). WREA, \nhowever, has been formed with: (i) no agreed national water resources policy or strategy yet \nestablished; (ii) no strategic guidelines or action plans that provide a roadmap for the various \nsubsectors in development planning; and (iii) without water legislation in place that can properly \nsupport contemporary approaches to IWRM.11 The water law approved in 1996 needs review \nand updating, and regulations must be drawn up to make it effective.12 \n \n8.  WREA  was  established  within  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister  and  includes  six \ndepartments, namely: (i) a cabinet office for the minister, (ii) an Environment Department, \n(iii) the Environmental Research Institute, (iv) Department of Water Resources (DWR) (v) the \nWater  Resources  Institute  (WRI),  and  (vi)  the  Department  of  Meteorology  and  Hydrology \n(DMH).13 Provincial-level water resources and environment departments are being set up to \ntake over the environmental functions of the science, technology, and environment agency, and \nthe data collection operations of the DMH. The WRCC and the Lao national Mekong committee \n                                                 \n7  The lower Mekong Basin countries are members of the MRC and use the commission to facilitate the resolution of \ntransboundary water issues. However, the performance of MRC has been constrained by the wide differences in \nskills and experience between the countries, and the perceived inequalities that result. \n8  ADB. 1998.

National Water Resources Profile. Vientiane. (draft) \n13 In October 2007 WREA has about 100 staff and a further 100 consultants and contractors. ", "  3\n(LNMC) have been merged into WREA. The WREA departments will appoint the secretariats of \nthe national water resources and environment committee, and of the LNMC, thereby placing \nWREA in a central role both in coordinating the national water sector, and within the wider \nsetting of regional water resource management. \n \n9.  ADB's water policy  (footnote 11) identifies the management of water resources as a \nfunction that is distinct from the delivery of water services. WREA will have an important role in \nthe coordination of resource managers and service providers, as the WREA mandate, which is \nin Appendix 2, focuses on strengthening the national capacity for water resource management, \nand the regulation of environmental impacts and water use by development activities. On the \nother hand, responsibility for the delivery of water services for irrigation, domestic water supply, \nand for hydropower, will remain with the relevant line agencies and private sector organizations. \nThis separation of regulation and service delivery will provide a strong platform for improved \nwater  governance  in  the  Lao  PDR  and  in  the  wider  basin  context.  The  proposed  TA  is \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s water policy and ADB's Water Financing Program,14 which supports \nincreased investments to improve water services and to strengthen water governance through \nnational water reforms and capacity development. \n \n10.  Preparatory work for the TA was undertaken in 2006\u20132007, including (i) a water sector \ninstitutional analysis (Supplementary Appendix A), (ii) preparation of a draft national water \nresources profile (footnote 12), and (iii) a national water balance study.15 The TA will address \ntwo key activities identified in the earlier institutional analysis (Supplementary Appendix B) as \nurgently required to enable the Lao PDR to advance the application of IWRM approaches in the \nmanagement of the nation's water resources. They are: (i) the development of a national water \nresource policy and strategy (NWRPS); and (ii) the design of the Lao PDR\u2019s IWRM support \nprogram, including financing requirements, as a means of coordinating development partner \nsupport, and implementing the recommendations of the institutional analysis.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the TA will be the implementation of effective integrated water resources \nmanagement in the Lao PDR as a cornerstone of sustainable development and economic \ngrowth.  \n \n12.  The immediate outcome will be that the WREA will be strengthened and will be able to \nprovide effective leadership in the implementation of the national water resources policy and \nstrategy. The national IWRM program will enable development partners to harmonize support to \nthe WREA within the coordinated national IWRM support program, with the objective of moving \ntowards a program-based approach. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The outputs of the TA will provide the foundations for national river basin planning and \nmanagement, and will better equip the Lao PDR to participate more equally and effectively in \nregional activities. The creation of the Lao PDR\u2019s overall IWRM support program will provide a \nroad  map  for  achieving  effective  IWRM,  and  provide  the  WREA  with  a  nationally  owned \nprogram as a basis for (i) human resources and budget planning, and (ii) the coordinated \n                                                 \n14  ADB. 2006.

ADB's water financing program 2006\u20132010 will double \ninvestments  by  ADB  and  other  development  partners  in  the  water  sector,  including  reforms  and  capacity \ndevelopment  programs  aimed  at  rural  communities,  cities,  and  river  basins.

Vientiane. \n ", "4   \nmobilization  of  resources  from  the  Government  and  external  development  partners.16 The \nNWRPS will provide clear strategies, guidelines, and action plans in the agreed priority areas of \nIWRM,  and  thus  give  clear  directions  for  all  water  sector  line  agencies  in  planning  and \nmanagement of activities.  \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 2 years in three components. Each will lead to specific \noutputs  that  contribute  to  the  expected  outcome  of  positioning  WREA  at  the  center  of \nsustainable integrated water resources management and regulation, with resource development \nand water services delivery provided through the appropriate line agencies and the private \nsector. The methodology and key activities under each component are detailed in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  Component  1:  Diagnostic  Assessment  of  Water  Data  and  Analysis  Systems \n(phase 1): This will undertake a diagnostic analysis of water related data, information and \nanalytical systems as the first phase of a Water Resources Inventory and Assessment. The \ndiagnostic assessment will review and analyze existing provisions and processes for collection, \nprocessing  and  storage  of  hydrology  and  meteorology,  water  quality  and  groundwater \ninformation for all major river basins in the Lao PDR. The assessment will define the strategic \nneeds for future IWRM and develop action plans for improvements in data, information, systems \nand  models.  This  component  will  be  implemented  approximately  6  months  after  the  TA \ninception. \n \n16.  Component 2: National Water Resources Policy and Strategy. This will assist WREA \nin (i) the formulation of an interim water resources policy, and strategies for the period 2008\u2013\n201017; and (ii) the development of forward-looking water resources policies and strategies to \nguide water sector development and management beyond 2010. The development of the water \nresources policies and strategy will involve multiagency participation18 to establish a national \nIWRM  policy  framework,  identify  key  result  and  priority  areas  within  the  policy,  prepare \nsubsector specific strategies and action plans for these key areas, and lay out performance \ntargets, output and outcome indicators, and performance reporting processes. The strategy will \ninclude a road map for investments in the water sector linked to the MRC\u2019s lower Mekong Basin \ndevelopment  plan.  This  is  a  major  component  of  the  TA  and  will  be  implemented  over \n20 months. \n \n17.  Component 3: Developing the Lao PDR\u2019s National Integrated Water Resources \nManagement Support Program. This will build on the earlier scoping study (Supplementary \nAnnex A) and the national water resources profile (footnote 12) to design the Lao PDR\u2019s IWRM \nsupport  program.  The  consultants  will  make  a  detailed  analysis,  in  consultation  with  the \nGovernment and development partner stakeholders, of the resources required for the WREA to \ndevelop the capacity to provide leadership in IWRM. The program will include recommendations \nfor  results-based  management,  performance  monitoring  arrangements,  accountability \nmechanisms, and arrangements for program implementation, including consultant inputs and \nother support needs. This component will be implemented immediately upon TA approval so \n                                                 \n16  Consultations with development partners during the ADB and AFD fact-finding mission (October 2007) confirmed \nwillingness to support WREA through a harmonized, program-based approach. AFD confirmed support to WREA \nunder the redirected component 1 of the Nam Ngum River Basin Development Project (footnote 3). The Australian \nAgency for International Development stated the intention to provide resources to (i) strengthen the policy \ndevelopment; (ii) diagnostic analysis of data collection, processing and analysis, and (iii) hydrological modeling and \ninformation management.   \n17  The Government of the Lao PDR has a 5-year national planning cycle. WREA has been formed midway through \nthe current plan and has requested assistance to (i) develop an interim water sector policy and strategy for the \nremainder of the current national plan to guide short-term decision making, and (ii) to formulate a longer-term water \nsector policy and strategy to guide water resource development and management over 2011\u20132015 and beyond. \n18  Key stakeholders to be involved include  the agencies  responsible for Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, \nDepartment of Irrigation, Ministry of Public Works and Transport, and agencies responsible for hydropower \ndevelopment, including Electricit\u00e9 du Laos, Ministry of Mines and Energy, and civil society organizations. ", "  5\nthat the program document can be available as a framework for development partner support to \nthe sector from mid-2008. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,060,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB's  TA  funding  program  ($500,000)  and  the  Government  of  Australia \n($500,000) and administered by ADB. The Government will finance the remaining $60,000 \nequivalent in kind by providing office accommodation, counterpart staff, transport, and others \n(data and maps). Detailed cost estimate and financing plan are shown in Appendix 4. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The WREA will be the Executing Agency. The TA will be implemented within three \nWREA  divisions:  (i)  the  department  of  water  resources;  (ii)  the  water  resources  institute, \nestablished following creation of WREA in May 2007; and (iii) the department of meteorology \nand hydrology. The TA will be coordinated by a subcommittee of the national water resources \nand environment committee, the national water sector apex body. Consistent with the overall \ngoal to strengthen the Lao PDR\u2019s capacity with regard to both national and international IWRM, \ncollaboration will be established and maintained with the MRC and its secretariat throughout the \nimplementation of the TA. The TA will be implemented over 2 years from February 2008 to \nJanuary 2010. ADB will provide supervision through regular review missions and participation in \nworkshops at key stages. All equipment procured will be transferred to the Executing Agency \nupon completion of the TA. \n \n20.  ADB will mobilize 33 person-months of international and 53 person-months of national \nspecialists  to  support  WREA  in  implementing  the  TA.  They  will  be  engaged  by  ADB  in \naccordance with the ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). Consulting services will be engaged in two packages. Consultants for components 1 \nand 2 will be engaged through a firm or association of firms, using quality- and cost-based \nselection (QCBS 90:10) as a single package. It will include an international consultant with \nexpertise in IWRM and institutions specialization as team leader (18 person-months), short-term \nconsultants  with  expertise  in  IWRM  (international,  11  person-months;  national,  49  person- \nmonths). Expertise will include hydropower, irrigation, urban and rural domestic water supply \nand sanitation, and aquatic ecosystems. A simplified technical proposal will be required. For \ncomponent 3, consultants will be engaged as individual consultants, including international \nIWRM specialist (2.0 person-months); international program development specialist (2.0 person-\nmonths) and two national IWRM specialists (2.0 person-months). Outline terms of reference \n(TOR) for consultants in each of the three components are given in Appendix 3. \n \n21.  Effective dissemination of the TA outputs will be critical to achieving full ownership by \nthe Government of the project outputs. During implementation, consultation workshops will \nensure that key stakeholders (footnote 18) participate in achieving the expected outcomes of \nthe TA. Workshops will be organized to debate key findings and to facilitate dissemination of \npolicies and strategy documents.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Australia, and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic for Updating the National Water Policy and Strategy, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nIntegrated water  All major river basins in  Basin plans and RBO  \u2022 Government remains \nresources management  the Lao PDR have  annual reports  committed to sustainable \nsupports development  IWRM programs by    water resources and \nand sustained economic  2015.    environmental \ngrowth in the Lao      management. \nPeople\u2019s Democratic  Investment decisions  Project investment plans   \nRepublic.  are consistent with river  and proposals reported in  Risks \nbasin plans from 2012  RBO annual reports and  \u2022 WREA is not able to attract \nWREA annual reports  and retain necessary \nskilled professionals. \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nWater Resources and  By mid 2010 WREA is  Minutes of NWREC  \u2022 The Lao PDR endorses \nEnvironment  effectively coordinating  meetings  outputs within a \nAdministration provides  water-related planning  reasonable time. \nMinutes of DG meetings of \neffective leadership in the  and management   \nwater-related agencies \nimplementation of  activities, through  Risks \nNational water resources  structured support to  Minutes and action plans  \u2022 NWREC is ineffective and \npolicy and strategy.  the national water  of WREA monthly  fails to provide apex level \nresources and  executive and senior  guidance. \nenvironment  management meetings  \u2022 Interagency cooperation \ncommittee, and DG  with NWRPS is not \nMajor decisions of \nmeetings of water- effective. \nNWREC and WREA \nrelated agencies.  \u2022 WREA communication and \npublished on WREA \n  awareness systems are \nwebsites \nSupport program  ineffective. \nreceives confirmed \ndevelopment partner \nsupport by month 12. \nOutput      Assumptions \n       \n1.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank jointly undertook studies in \n2004 to assess the likely future needs for integrated water resources management in the lower \nMekong Basin, which is shared by Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), \nThailand, and Viet Nam. A key conclusion of these studies, presented in the Mekong water \nresources assistance strategy (MWRAS), was that, before investors could confidently support \nthe clear need for major balanced development; there must be extensive capacity building for all \naspects of integrated water resources management (IWRM) to provide a stronger platform for \ncooperation in the governance of water resources in the basin. Only then could the difficult \ntrade-off negotiations and decisions relating to international water development be undertaken \nequitably.   \n \n2.  In the case of the Lao PDR, a more detailed scoping study was undertaken to define \nmore  clearly  how  such  a  long-term  strengthening  program  could  be  developed  and \nimplemented.  Ten specific areas of IWRM were identified as needing support. These were to be \nrolled into an overall program structure that would have a common goal and focus, and form the \nstrategic blueprint for the future development of IWRM in the Lao PDR. The Lao PDR has \nrecently overcome the previous wide fragmentation of water resource functions through the \ncreation of a consolidated water and environment administration, which includes a department \nof water resources with a strong mandate for all aspects of IWRM. This has provided a clear \norganizational home for the IWRM strengthening activities.  \n3.  The primary objective of the TA is to support the development of the overall program \nstructure and content, and to address the top priorities within the 10 specific needs. The TA has \nthree components: (i) a diagnostic assessment (DA) and phase 1 of a water resources inventory \nthat  will  review,  analyze  and  interpret  hydrology  and  meteorology,  water  quality  and \ngroundwater information for all major river basins. The DA will define the broad strategic data \nand  modeling  needs  for  future  IWRM  to  be  addressed  in  a  second  phase  that  will  be \nimplemented within the overall IWRM support program subsequent to this TA. (ii) development \nof a national water resource policy and strategy, which will involve multiagency participation to \nestablish a national IWRM policy framework, identify key result or priority areas within the policy, \nprepare specific strategies and action plans for these key areas, and lay out performance \ntargets,  output  and  outcome  indicators  and  performance  reporting  processes,  and  (iii) \ndevelopment  of  the  Lao  PDR  IWRM  support  program  and  supporting  management  and \nmonitoring arrangements, ready for consideration and endorsement by the Government. \n \n4.  Consulting services for the TA will be engaged in two separate packages by ADB, in \naccordance with the ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time \nto time). Consulting services for components 1 and 2 will be engaged through a firm, using \nquality-and-cost-based  selection,  with  a  ratio  of  90:10,  and  will  include  an  international \nconsultant as IWRM and institutional specialist designated as team leader (18 person-months), \nshort-term consultants with expertise in various aspects1of IWRM (11 person-months), and \nnational consultants with skills in IWRM (49 person-months). Consultants for component 3 will \nbe engaged as individual consultants, and include: an international IWRM specialist (2 person-\nmonths); an international program development specialist (2 person-months); and two national \nIWRM specialists (2 person-months each). \n                                                 \n1  Expertise required will include water resources assessment, irrigation water management, hydropower operations \nand planning, rural and urban water supply and sanitation, hydrology and meteorology, hydrological modeling, \naquatic ecosystems, and environmental management. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n \n5.  The TA will be executed and implemented by the WREA. The TA consultants will be \nbased  at  the  WREA  offices  in  Vientiane.  The  consultants  will  maintain  close  working \narrangements with WREA staff, consultants working on component 1 of the Nam Ngum project2, \nand the basin development plan team of the Mekong River Commission. WREA will provide in-\nkind support, as agreed before any assignment. \n \nI.  Component 1: Diagnostic Assessment of Water Data and Analysis Systems \n (Phase 1, Package 1) \nA.  Background \n6.  The Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) has been amalgamated in to the \nnewly established Water Resources and Environment Administration (WREA). As a first step \ntowards ensuring a sound water resource decisions the technical assistance will undertake a \ndiagnostic assessment of water resources data, information and analytical systems (covering \nhydrology and meteorology, surface water and groundwater and quantity and quality) that will \ndefine the strategic needs for future IWRM, and will also provide a present day assessment and \nsummary of the available water related information on a river basin basis.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The consultants and WREA project team will;  \n \n(i)  review existing water related data, information and analytical tools within all major \nriver basins in Lao PDR, and related information and systems within the MRC \nSecretariat  (the  existing  national  Water  Resources  Profile  will  be  a  base \ndocument for this work), \n(ii)  assess weaknesses and gaps relative to the existing and future IWRM and river \nbasin planning activities within Lao PDR (this will include a summary assessment \nof  existing water related information on a river basin basis),  \n(iii)  develop  strategic  action  plans  and  projects,  both  for  data  networks  and \nprocessing and modeling activities as well as human resource/capacity needs, \nthat should be implemented over the following 5 years to fill these gaps, and \nsummarize proposed actions in a log frame format,  \n \n8.  Close liaison with WREA WRD, WRI and the MRCS must be maintained during the \nassessment to ensure the resulting recommendations are consistent with the emerging needs of \nthe WREA and also compatible with systems and processes supported by MRC. \n \n9.  The main outputs of component 1 will be a diagnostic review report of the existing \napproaches  and  capacity  of  DMH  to  obtain,  manage  and  utilize  water  resources  and \nmeteorological information. DMH is the main agency involved in the collection and processing of \nsuch data but other parts of water related data and information that are essential for IWRM, \nsuch as water ecological information, may be collected and processed by other agencies; this \nwill need to be considered in the assessments and diagnostic study. The review will include \nrecommendations  for  strengthening  the  data  collection,  data  processing  and  information \nmanagement systems. Opportunities to improve the utilization of data collection networks and \n                                                 \n2   ADB. 2002.

All consultants \nwill have experience working with international consultants. Ability to communicate and report in \nEnglish will be essential. \n \nII.  Component 2: National Water Resources Policy and Strategy (Package 1) \n \nA.  Background \n14.  A  long-standing  fragmentation  of  responsibility  for  water  management  has  been \naddressed by the Government of the Lao PDR with the creation of the consolidated WREA. The \nWREA includes a department of water resources with a mandate for all aspects of IWRM. \nHowever, there is (i) no agreed national water resources policy or strategy, (ii) no strategic \nguidelines or action plans that provide a road map for the various sectors in development ", "  Appendix 3  13 \nplanning, and (iii) no modern water legislation in place that can properly support contemporary \napproaches to IWRM. \n \nB.  Scope of Services  \n15.  The TA will help the WREA develop a national water resources policy and strategy \n(NWRPS). The NWRPS will relate the national goals and objectives\u2014national socioeconomic \nand poverty reductions plans\u2014with the natural resource inventories of the country on a river \nbasin basis. This will enable the development of scenarios for growth balanced with resource \nprotection, and thus define the national water resource goals and targets. Up to 10 key water \nresource  management  components\u2014including  water  planning  principles,  water  use  and \nexploitation,  water  efficiency  and  demand  management,  flood  management,  and  water \nenvironmental protection\u2014will be investigated to define strategies, procedures, and guidelines \nthat will guide various sectors in water-related planning and management for each component. \nFigure A3 provides general details of this concept. The specific project management approach \nwould  be  developed  at  the  initial  stages  of  the  project,  and  approved  by  WREA  before \nimplementation commenced.   \n \n16.  The NWRPS must be prepared with the full participation of multiagency working groups \nfor each water management component area. Technical reviews and analyses for each of the \n10 components will be done by WREA or another delegated agency, and reports will presented \nto the working groups for debate and agreement. Provinces and districts must be consulted \nduring this process to ensure the local views are taken into account, and representatives of all \nrelevant external stakeholders should be consulted. \n \n17.  An interim policy and strategy will be completed within 4 months of the start of the \nNWRPS development process to guide WREA with its initial work plan; however, the overall \nNWRPS will take about 2 years to finalize, as it moves through the highly participative working \ngroup  procedure  that  is  essential  to  ensure  government  ownership  of  the  final  NWRPS. \nAdditional outputs, including strategies, procedures, and guidelines, will become available as \neach component is completed. \n \nC.  Methodology and Key Activities \n18.  The development of the NWRPS will involve three progressive steps. After step 1, an \ninterim water resources policy and strategy will be developed to provide guidance to WREA in \nits initial work planning and project activities. Main activities and outputs are summarized in \nTable A3. \n \n19.  A NWRPS project team will be established in WREA and led by a project manager, who \nwill be a senior manager from WREA. The team will be supported by international consultants, \ncomprising a technical adviser and team leader who will provide 18 person-months of input over \nthe 2-year project, plus numerous international and domestic consultants on short or periodic \nassignments  to  support  the  investigation  and  assessment  of  the  10  or  more  key  water \nmanagement areas. Up to 25 person-months of international consultants and 46 person-months \nof national consultants with a range of expertise in water resource management, strategic \nplanning, and policy development, is assumed in this component.

Component 3: Developing the Lao PDR National Integrated Water Resources \nManagement Program (Package 2) \nA.  Introduction \n23.  The TA will develop a comprehensive IWRM support program that will be owned and \nmanaged by the WREA. Development partners and the Government will then be able to provide \nproject and activity support within an overall programmatic structure. A national water resources \npolicy and strategy will be developed through a highly participative process. It will provide, for \nthe first time, detailed guidelines and procedures in 10 key water management areas that will \ndefine resource protection, use, and sustainable development principles that will show strategic \ndirection for all water sector agencies in their planning and management activities. Also for the \nfirst time, a diagnostic study of water resources data, information, and analytical systems\u2014\ncovering hydrology and meteorology, surface water and groundwater, and quantity and quality\u2014\nwill define the strategic needs for future IWRM.  \n \nB.  Scope of Services  \n24.  The assignment will be undertaken by an international program development specialist \nand IWRM experts (one international and two national), all recruited as individual consultants. \nEach will provide 2 person-months of input. Up to 1 week of the international consultant\u2019s input \nmay be provided from the home office for report revision and finalization. The IWRM and/or \nwater specialist will be designated as team leader to coordinate inputs and to be responsible for \nproduction of final outputs. Working with a local team from WREA, the consultants will \n \n(i)  review the earlier work within the MWRAS project, and the subsequent Lao PDR \nIWRM scoping study, and other relevant reports, relating to the Lao PDR\u2019s IWRM \nneeds; \n(ii)  identify additional IWRM needs and priorities that may have emerged since the \nearlier studies, in consultation with WREA and relevant line agencies; \n(iii)  package  all  relevant  activities  into  a  draft  Lao  PDR  IWRM  support  program \ndocument that meets the framework, content requirements, and standards of \nprogram documents of the Lao PDR, and its development partners, including \nADB\u2014paying particular attention to defining measurable indicators for monitoring \nthe program;  \n(iv)  discuss the draft program document in interviews and workshop sessions with all \nrelevant  agencies  and  stakeholders,  including  development  partners  and \nnongovernment organizations within the Lao PDR, and submit a final document \nto WREA and ADB; and \n(v)  develop an appropriate management and oversight modality for implementation \nof the IWRM program, in consultation with key stakeholders and development \npartners, including estimates of required management and overhead costs. \n \n25.  Because the  Lao PDR\u2019s IWRM support program will be owned and managed by WREA, \noptions  must  be  prepared  for  strengthening  its  project  management  skills  and  developing \nmonitoring and reporting processes that meet contemporary development partner  requirements. \nA proposal to engage a part-time adviser to the internal project management team may be \nincluded in the program document. The adviser would also provide advice to senior WREA \nlevels on policy and strategy issues relating to the program.  The overall program will be \ndeveloped with strong leadership by WREA management, and will be managed, monitored, and \nreported at the senior WREA levels. ", "  Appendix 3  17 \n \n26.  The main output of the component will be a detailed design document for a 5-year \nprogram of activities to enable the WREA to develop the skills and capacities necessary to lead \nthe implementation of IWRM approaches.  \n \n27.  Component 3 will be implemented at the start of the TA to ensure that the national IWRM \nsupport program document is available as early as possible to guide future support in the sector.  \n \nC.
