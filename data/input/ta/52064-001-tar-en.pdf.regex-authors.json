THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The Proposal \n1.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will support Southeast Asian \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) during 2019\u20132021 \nto improve urban services through technical, policy, and capacity development support for \nprojects and investment programs in the urban development and water sectors.1 During this \nperiod, ADB\u2019s urban development and water portfolio in Southeast Asia is expected to increase \nby $2.4 billion, equivalent to the current ADB portfolio developed during 2010\u20132018. \n \n2.  The TA facility will combine the preparation of various projects in Southeast Asian DMCs \nduring 2019\u20132021. Combined, regional TA is expected to result in a better-performing urban \ndevelopment and water portfolio in Southeast Asia than would be achieved through project-\nspecific TA because of improved (i) response time by providing DMCs with consistent urban \nsolutions, (ii) quality of outputs through efficient delivery systems, (iii) sector assessment and \npolicy support, and (iv) knowledge sharing across the region. \n \n3.  The TA facility is in line with the findings and recommendations of the midterm review of \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,2 and will increase (i) optimization of ADB resource use, including by more \neffectively prioritizing TA resource allocation and improving project design quality; (ii) project \nimplementation effectiveness by reducing delays in project implementation, promoting cost-\nefficient procurement of services, and optimizing the value addition of consultant services; and \n(iii) administrative cost-effectiveness.  \n \n2.  Sector Constraints and Opportunities \n4.  Urbanization trends. The Asia and Pacific region is experiencing rapid urbanization and \nis projected to be home to two-thirds of the world\u2019s urban population by 2050. In 2016, 47% of \nSoutheast Asia\u2019s population was classified as urban, compared to 54% globally. However, \nSoutheast Asia\u2019s annual urban population growth rate is 1.4%, vs. the world average of 0.9%.3  \n \n5.  Cities and economic hubs. Southeast Asia\u2019s economies are shifting toward industry and \nservices, making cities central to national economies. In addition to being major manufacturing \ncenters, cities are also national centers of education, science, technology, and innovation. ADB \nhas supported the Greater Mekong Subregion corridor towns development projects (GMS CTDP) \nin Southeast Asia with the objective of increasing economic activities along GMS economic \ncorridors through investment in urban infrastructure in corridor towns.4  \n \n6.  Climate change and disaster risk management. Southeast Asian cities are particularly \nexposed to climate change-related events such as temperature and sea level rise, flooding, \nchanges in rainfall patterns, and natural disasters that are increasing in frequency and severity. \nThe impact of such events is exacerbated by population concentrations in low-lying deltas and \n                                                \n1  A list of ensuing projects supported by the TA facility is detailed in Appendix 2. The ensuing projects and their \nrespective preparatory TAs are listed in the relevant country operation business plans. \n2  ADB. 2014.

(TA 8989-REG) \n ", "2 \ncoastal areas, and increased heat intensity in large cities, which make it imperative to increase \nthe climate resilience of urban infrastructure. Cities are also increasingly a major source of \ngreenhouse gas emissions due to unsustainable waste management and increasing energy \nconsumption by urban communities \n \n7.  Bridging  the  water  and  sanitation  infrastructure  gap.  The  estimated  annual \ninfrastructure investment needs in Southeast Asia total about $210 billion, about 10% of which is \nfor urban infrastructure.5 Significant gains have been seen since 2008 in the expansion of water \nsupply and sanitation services across Southeast Asia, but the gap in service provision remains \nsignificant in all but the most advanced countries (e.g., Singapore and Malaysia). Water supply \nhas received the most attention and support, while sanitation remains woefully underfunded. \nAccess to improved water supply in the region has grown from 60%\u201391% (2006) to 69%\u201391% \n(2016), while piped water supply coverage in 2016 was 10%\u201350%. Access to improved sanitation \nin the region has increased from 32%\u201386% (2006) to 58%\u201386% (2016), with sewerage coverage \nin 2016 of <1%\u201313%.6 Given women\u2019s roles in water and sanitation management, investments in \nimproved water and sanitation access can reduce their workload or \u201ctime poverty\u201d, in addition to \ngains from improved health, safety, and mobility. \n \n3.  Delivering Solutions and Facility Outcomes \n8.  The TA facility is aligned with the proposed Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priorities and will \nsupport the delivery of solutions for (i) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster \nresilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (ii) making cities more livable; and (iii) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity. \n \n9.  The TA facility will deliver urban solutions by improving (i) the urban planning process (by \ndeveloping spatial plans in a participatory and inclusive manner); (ii) the quality of urban service \ndelivery  (through  efficient  project  design  and  management  to  rehabilitate  and  expand \ninfrastructure  and  introduce  good  operation  and  maintenance  practices);  (iii)  institutional \neffectiveness in line ministries, local governments, and utilities (by ensuring sustainability through \ngood governance and improved credit worthiness); and (iv) the enabling environment for urban \nservices (by improving the policy, legal, and regulatory setting). \n \n10.  The TA facility will combine activities that will help develop the portfolio of the Southeast \nAsia  Department  Urban  Development  and Water  Division  (SEUW) during  2019\u20132021,  and \nthereby  help  catalyze  and  mobilize  resources  needed  for  development;  strengthen  ADB\u2019s \nknowledge services and support to DMCs; and improve ADB\u2019s response to client needs with \nrespect to project design, administration, and knowledge management. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n11.  Output 1: Improved planning, project design, and readiness. The TA facility will be \nprovided for planning and design of ensuing projects to ensure they are procurement-ready. \nSpatial, inclusive, climate-resilient, and participatory planning approaches will be considered \nwhere appropriate in prioritizing project and/or programs for ADB financing. Detailed activities will \ninclude, when required: (i) geospatial analysis and earth observation; (ii) feasibility studies and/or \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2017.

The TA facility will also explore options to apply \nadvanced  or  high-level  technology  in  project  design  by  adapting  such  technology  to  local \nconditions, with awareness of the local contracting market. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Improved  developing  member  country  staff  capacity  in  project \nadministration and urban service delivery. DMC staff capacity building will include (i) peer-to-\npeer arrangements for urban service delivery; (ii) project administration oversight; and (iii) support \nin establishing design standards, policy, and regulatory frameworks. Assistance will be provided \nin specific fields of expertise, including (i) technical expertise in advanced technology in core \nurban services (water supply; sewerage; sanitation, including non-networked sanitation solutions; \nsolid waste management; flood control and drainage; and road engineering); (ii) procurement and \ncontract management (resolving bid evaluation and contractual disputes); and (iii) social and \nenvironmental safeguard monitoring (resolving noncompliance issues). The TA facility will support \nDMC staff in delivering project administration activities under the existing loan portfolio and for \nnewly approved loans.   \n \n13.  Output 3: Improved knowledge management and sharing among Southeast Asia \ndeveloping member countries. The TA facility will support knowledge management and sharing \nthrough the organization of training, workshops, and conferences at the regional level, enhancing \nknowledge  and  lesson  sharing  among  Southeast  Asian  DMCs  that  will  support  project \ndevelopment of proposed loans and administration of ongoing and newly approved loans. The TA \nfacility will also support, when required, the production of knowledge products and will work in \nclose  collaboration  with  ADB\u2019s  urban  and  water  sector  groups  to  collect  and  disseminate \nappropriate lessons. To the extent possible, the TA facility will also support peer-to-peer learning \nthrough twinning arrangements between DMC organizations and developed country.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $9 million, of which (i) $5 million will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6); (ii) $3 million will be financed \non a grant basis by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF) under the Urban \nFinancing Partnership Facility and administered by ADB; 8 and (iii) $1 million will be financed on \na grant basis by the Project Readiness Improvement Trust Fund (PRITF), and administered by \nADB. 9 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n15.  The UCCRTF will specifically support SEUW projects on climate-resilient urban services \nthrough participatory spatial planning, climate change vulnerability assessments, institutional \nstrengthening, stakeholder consultation, knowledge management, and community-led projects. \n                                                \n7  Detailed engineering designs will exclusively be financed by fund sources other than ADB\u2019s special funds, provided \nthere is no explicit exclusion of financing a detailed engineering design in the relevant regulations, implementation \nguidelines, or agreements of any fund financing the TA facility. \n8 Financing Partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \nCurrently eligible Southeast Asian countries are Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Viet Nam.  \n9  Financing partner: Nordic Development Fund.  \n ", "4 \nThe PRITF provides an innovative grants mechanism for supporting both design and procurement \nreadiness of climate change-responsive infrastructure projects in Southeast Asian countries. \n \n16.  The TA facility scope is expected to be expanded to cover other additional activities, \nconsistent with the TA facility\u2019s outputs, and the facility will be replenished from time to time as \nfunds are required and identified. The governments will provide counterpart support in the form \nof data acquisition and counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB is the executing agency for the TA and will administer the TA facility and implement \nit through SEUW.  \n \n18.  Output 1 activities for an ensuing project will commence only after ADB approves the \nproject concept paper of the ensuing project. Output 2 activities to assist DMCs in project \nmanagement may commence on TA facility approval. Output 3 activities involving knowledge \nmanagement and sharing may also commence on TA facility approval. The TA facility will be \nimplemented over 42 months and is expected to commence no later than October 2018.10 \n \n19.  The TA facility will recruit a single firm to assist in achieving the outputs. A core team from \nthe firm will be based at ADB headquarters to ensure integration of consultant activities into \nSEUW\u2019s workplan. Offices at project locations will be established when required, either at DMC \ncounterpart premises, ADB resident missions, or rental offices, depending on location and \navailability. \n \n20.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  October 2018\u2013March 2022 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  Southeast Asia Department, Urban Development and Water Division  \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Firm: QCBS (90:10)  Facility consultants  $9.0 million \nAdvance contracting  The single consulting contract will be procured through advance contracting \nfollowing ADB. 2013. Specific Requirements for Recruiting Consultants by \nADB. Project Administration Instructions. PAI No. 2.04, Section E. Manila. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nDisbursement will follow cost-sharing principle, subject to the implementation \nguidelines of the UCCRTF and PRIF. DEDs will be financed by funds other \nthan ADB special funds, provided fund regulations do not explicitly exclude \nthe financing of DEDs. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, DED = detailed engineering design, PRITF = Project Readiness Improvement Trust \nFund, QCBS = quality and cost-based selection, TA = technical assistance, UCCRTF = Urban Climate Change \nResilience Trust Fund.   \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n21.  Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants through advance contracting \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \n                                                \n10 Funds from UCCRTF and PRITF will be exclusively targeted to support Output 1 activities. Project concept papers \nwill be shared with the Facility Managers of the respective funds in line with business processes for transaction TAs. \n \n ", "5 \nproject administration instructions and/or staff instructions.11 Survey and other support services \nwill be acquired by the consultant following the ADB Procurement Policy.  \n \n22.  One firm will be selected through a retainer contract to carry out all activities identified \nunder the TA facility.12 The recruitment will follow a quality and cost-based selection (90:10) \nprocess. For each assignment, the firm will be required to prepare a technical and financial \nproposal proposition that will be agreed with ADB. Upon approval of the proposition, ADB will \nissue a task order describing the specific scope of activities (such as the preparation of a specific \nloan), the related costs, and the expertise required. The consultant will carry out the services, with \npayment on an output basis at the agreed price based on the financial proposition.13  \n \n23.  Detailed engineering design.  Such activities are financed by funds other than ADB\u2019s \nspecial funds. Currently, the regulations, implementation guidelines, or agreements of UCCRTF \nand PRITF support financing of detailed engineering designs. Prior to finalizing the concept paper \nof the ensuing loan, a memorandum of understanding will be signed with the relevant government \nagency describing the scope and implementation arrangements, with an explicit clause that holds \nthe consultants liable for any claims. This will be incorporated in the general and particular \nconditions of the consultant\u2019s contract. \n \n24.  Cofinancier  requirements.  As  required  by  the  UCCRTF  and  PRITF  or  any  future \nfinancier, the TA facility will report activities related to consultations and capacity building against \ndisaggregated data. \n \nE.  Governance \n \n25.  ADB is the executing agency, and thus the financial management, procurement, and \nintegrity risks during implementation are assessed to be low. However, the TA facility will conduct \nthorough risk assessments of governance subjects for ensuing investment projects. \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under the Urban \nFinancing  Partnership Facility;  (ii)  ADB  administering  a  portion  of technical  assistance  not \nexceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Project Readiness \nImprovement Trust Fund; and (iii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of \n$5,000,000 on a grant basis for the Southeast Asia Urban Services Facility, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n \n \n                                                \n11  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n12  Based on economies of scale, it is expected that highly qualified consulting firms will be interested and offer more \ncompetitive bids for a single, high-volume assignment. The principle of increased economies of scale will reduce \noverhead and provide more competitive pricing and reduce experts\u2019 billing rates. \n13  This approach is similar to that used by ADB. 2017.
