Project Background \n1.  Poverty alleviation project utilizing photovoltaic (PV) deployment is ongoing throughout \nthe country.1 The project aims to address rural income issue by installing solar panels on \nresident\u2019s rooftops, and/or agricultural greenhouses. Each household would be able to consume \nthe generated electricity as well as sell the excess electricity to the national grid company. The \nstable revenue from selling electricity would give rural households economic self-sufficiency. This \nmodel, however, does not function as expected unless the PV installation cost is subsidized. Non-\nsubsidized profitable PV deployment in underdeveloped rural areas could be achieved if policy \ndevelopment, such as supply side reform and market-oriented mechanism investment, will be in \nplace. Removal of policy barriers would allow local farmers join the project as well as the operation \nand maintenance with support from enterprises. \n \n2.  Relatively high installation cost seems to have partly resulted from the installation design \nwhich does not take into consideration diversified local conditions of rural areas. Because profile \nof rural villages varies, installation design customized for different profiles would lower the \ninstallation cost. Likewise, business environment of PV installation as well as surplus electricity \nsale business can be customized depending on local environment of the project sites. \n \n3.  This study aims to propose optimal PV development models customized for selected rural \nvillage profiles. The study will also expand the models beyond PV plants to the other clean energy \ndeployment, including wind, biomass, and geothermal. The optimal models would (i) lower \ninstallation cost by modified policy/regulation, and (ii) promote clean energy supply infrastructure. \nFor the latter purpose, the knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will also propose to \nreplace existing cooking and heating stoves at end-users by clean cooking and heating stoves. \n \n4.  Once the optimal models are developed, local villages may team up with enterprises to be \nable to reasonably distribute the income, promoting employment, and reducing poverty. This \nwould further support net-zero carbon emission in rural areas, bringing clean air with economic \ngrowth to rural areas. \nB.  Purpose of the Assignment \n5.  The study will recruit a team of consultants to provide solutions for the identified problems. \nThe study team will comprise two individual international consultants and a national consulting \nfirm. The National Energy Administration (NEA) is the executing agency (EA), and its International \nCooperation Department is the implementing agency (IA). \nC.  Duration and Location of the Services \n6.  The work is expected to be conducted over 18 months in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC). At least two sample sites will be selected for case study purpose. \nD.

The local condition differs \namong rural villages at different locations, e.g., desert, high mountains, valleys, \ncoastal  areas.  Therefore,  optimal  models  of  low-carbon  modern  energy \ninfrastructure development should be distinct to local conditions. Considering the \ndiversified profile of rural villages in the country, the task will standardize rural village \nprofiles based on their key characteristics. This task aims to maximize the study \nresult, applying the derived models/scheme to rural villages with similar profiles over \nthe nation. \n \nThe profile comprises characteristics which strongly affect the low-carbon power \ngeneration installation cost, such as transportation accessibility, climatic condition, \ngeographical characteristics, and regulatory environment. Sample factors which \nwould affect the profile may include but not be limited to the following: \n \n[Technical aspects] \na.  Available land size.  \nb.  Geographical accessibility, and relevant cost of material transportation. \nc.  Benchmark purchase price of renewable energy electricity by local energy supply \ncompanies. \nd.

This project will select 1-2 representative small- and medium-sized towns (SMTs) in \nnorthern  and  southern  People\u2019s  Republic  China  (PRC)  respectively  to  study  the  energy \nmodernization solutions considering local conditions, so as to meet the rapidly growing energy \ndemand  of  small-  and medium-sized towns  (SMTs),  lower  carbon  dioxide  (CO )  emission, \n2\nimprove energy efficiency, and form strong demonstration and promotion benefits.  \n \n2.  While the energy supply development in large urban cities have been paid attention \nenough to build modern and low-carbon energy supply system, not in SMTs. Although most of \nPRC\u2019s SMTs have access to energy, the supply is not sufficient, more costly, less efficient, and \nemits more CO  and pollution than that in large urban cities. \n2\n \n3.  These issues remain in SMTs because of the following reasons: (1) inadequate policy \nsupport. PRC has not yet issued a specific policy that comprehensively focuses on the energy \nmodernization in SMTs. The central government issued similar guideline in 2017 but mainly \ntargeting  large  urban  cities  like  Beijing  and  Tianjin;4 (2)  insufficient  promotion  of  energy \nmodernization technology. The technologies suitable for energy modernization in SMTs, such as \ndistributed energy, smart grid, multi-energy complementation, and energy connectivity, have not \nbeen widely applied; and (3) incentives have not really been established. There are few specific \nincentive mechanisms to promote energy modernization in SMTs. \n \n4.  To address the above issues, the study aims to identify energy supply modernization \nmodels optimal to diversified local condition of SMTs. The models with policies and guidelines are \nexpected to increase energy supply capacity in SMTs and to help energy transition toward low-\ncarbon energy supply. The knowledge of the identified models can be shared with the other \ncountries with large populations and high energy consumption and emissions, such as India, \nBangladesh, Indonesia,  and Viet Nam. Major beneficiaries would be low-carbon energy service \nproviders, distributed RE plant owners, and installers. Private sector participants would be the \nkey. \n \n5.  The study defines SMTs as townships with residential population of less than 1 million \n(small-sized towns with less than 0.5 million). The total number of SMTs in PRC is estimated \naround 2,000, covering around 90% of PRC with population of 1 billion (75% of total) in 2018. The \ntotal gross domestic product (GDP) is around half of the national GDP as of 2018, and some \nSMTs, specifically those in Eastern PRC are quite developed. This study will focus more on \ndeveloping SMTs like those in western PRC. \n \nB.  Purpose of the Assignment \n6.  The study will recruit consultants to provide solutions for the identified problems through \na feasibility study. The study team will comprise two individual international consultants and a \nnational consulting firm.

", "17 \n \nC.  Duration and Location of the Services \n \n7.  The work is expected to be conducted over 18 months in PRC. The TA plans to select at \nleast one SMT each in northern and southern PRC, because of the different energy consumption \nbehavior and availability of energy supply resources. Energy landscape in northern PRC, such as \nShanxi and Inner Mongolia, is characterized by abundant primary energy resources like natural \ngas, large temperature differences through four seasons, large heat demand in winter, and \nserious air pollution issues mainly caused by coal use. The one in southern and central PRC, as \nJiangsu  and  Zhejiang,  is  characterized  by  relatively  scarce  primary  energy  resources, \ndependence on imported energy, high energy prices, emerging heating demand in winter along \nwith the improved living standards.  \n \nD.  Scope of Services \n \n8.  The study will focus on modernizing energy supply infrastructure, improving energy \nefficiency, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and lowering low-carbon energy supply \ncosts in SMTs.  Solutions will consider local conditions, including the rapidly growing economic \nand energy demand of SMTs. The TA will also explore emerging technologies such as digital \ntechnology, battery storage, and micro-grids. Advanced operation practices like energy trading \nusing blockchain technology would be considered. As a means of energy modernization scheme, \nthe following are expected to be included in the study reports: (i) optimal energy modernization \nscheme for SMTs in northern PRC, (ii) optimal energy modernization scheme for SMTs in \nsouthern  PRC,  and  (iii)  relevant  needed  policies  to  support  the  development  of  energy \nmodernization in SMTs. The study will develop and analyze the models for the selected pilot \ntownships with standardized township profile. The scale-up impact of applying the models to the \ntownships with similar profile over the nation will be evaluated. The impact includes economic \naspects as well as air quality aspects. The analysis result will be disseminated at workshops. The \npolicy recommendation obtained are expected to be incorporated to relevant national or local \ngovernment\u2019s clean energy policy. \n \n9.  The consultant will conduct the following tasks and prepare the deliverables: \n(i)  Task 1: Standardize and categorize SMT profiles. The local condition differs \namong SMTs at different locations, e.g., desert, high mountains, valleys, coastal \nareas. Therefore, optimal models of low-carbon modern energy infrastructure \ndevelopment  should  be  \"different\"  by  the  local  conditions.  Considering  the \ndiversified profile of SMTs over the nation, the task will standardize SMT profiles \nbased on their key characteristics. This task aims to maximize the study result, \napplying the derived models/scheme to SMTs with similar profiles over the nation.  \nThe profile would comprise factors, such as transportation accessibility, climatic \ncondition, available renewable energy resource, energy consumption behavior, \nand regulatory condition. All the factors would affect the optimal low-carbon energy \nsupply models in SMTs. Existing 2,000 SMTs will be classified into the derived \nstandardized profiles. This will help the later process to calculate economic and \nenvironmental impact of the models. Sample factors which would affect the profile \nmay include but not be limited to the following: \n \n[Technical aspects] \n(i)  Available land size.  \n(ii)  Geographical accessibility, and relevant cost of material transportation. \n \n ", "18 \n \n(iii)  Benchmark  purchase  price  of  renewable  energy  electricity  by  local \nenergy supply companies. \n(iv)  Potential low-carbon primary energy resources, such as utilization hours \nof photovoltaic (PV) power generation, wind, biomass, and waste heat. \n[Economic/commercial aspects] \n(a)  Land rental fee. \n(b)  Local tax exemption policies, and preferred treatment on tax for low-\ncarbon energy infrastructure projects. \n(c)  Availability of commercial/government loan with preferred condition like \npremium rate. \n(d)  Existing/ potential market players as potential low-carbon energy supplier. \n \nMajor deliverable is several standardized SMT profiles in northern and southern \nPRC. The consultant is to list the positive and negative factors to characterize the \nprofiles. \n \n(ii)  Task 2: Select demonstration (sample) SMTs. The project will select 1-2 typical \nsmall and medium-sized towns in the north and south of PRC to derive the optimal \nlow-carbon energy supply scheme suitable for the selected profiles. The TA's \nworking  committee,  comprising  the  executing  agency  (EA),  National  Energy \nAdministration (NEA), and the implementing agency (IA), NEA\u2019s International \nCooperation Department, will shortlist several candidate SMTs. The consultant will \nfinalize the sample SMTs, agreed with the working committee. To align with the \nTA purpose, the less-developed SMTs will be selected as the TA's target. For \nreference, tentative candidates include SMTs in Inner Mongolia and Jiangsu \nprovinces.  \n \nThe major selection criteria include but not limited to: (i) SMT profile with maximum \nscale-up effect over the nation expected should be selected. The share of the \nselected SMT\u2019s profile should be within the top three so that largest economic \nimpact would be expected when the derived optimal models are applied over the \ncountry; (ii) the SMT location would focus on relatively underdeveloped SMTs.  \n \nMajor deliverables include at least one pilot SMT each in northern and southern \nPRC, the selection reasons, and the estimated scale-up effect over the nation, e.g. \navoided CO  and particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometer in diameter (PM ) \n2 2.5\nemissions. The effect would be measured by: (i) economic growth rate; (ii) CO  \n2\nemission  per  household  (or  capita);  (iii)  elasticity  of  CO   emission  against \n2\neconomic growth; (iv) avoided PM  emission. \n2.5\n \n(iii)  Task 3: Carry out field survey to collect data of the selected pilot SMTs \nnecessary to implement the study. Through the survey, understand the current \nenergy  supply  landscape  there.  The  data  may  include  energy  consumption \nbehavior, energy resources, CO / PM  emissions, policy and regulation on low-\n2 2.5\ncarbon energy supply service, and market overview of the energy supply service \nin the study locations. Specific data may include: (a) the current structure of energy \nsupply and power system structure; (b) R&D technology trends; (c) available low-\ncarbon primary energy resource potential, including wind, solar, biomass, and \ngeothermal; and (d) combined heat and power fueled by natural gas development \npotential. See Attachment-1 in case of (partially) outsourcing the survey. \n ", "19 \n \nMajor deliverables include detailed data of the pilot sites. \n \n(iv)  Task 4: Conduct literature review to avoid redundancy with past similar studies. \nThe project will fully investigate the development of the world's latest modern \nenergy technology and practices, especially distributed energy, smart grid, artificial \nintelligence,  gas-electricity-heat  combined  operation  of  the  multi-energy \ncomplementary system, understand the principle of technologies themself as well \nas the application of typical cases in SMTs in developed countries. NEA has \nlaunched over 100 demonstration projects for clean heating in towns in 2018. ADB \nhas  conducted  similar  studies. 5  Consultant  will  review  these  literatures, \nsummarizing their key findings, identifying missing pieces for further analysis. \n \nMajor  deliverable  is  the  list  of  past  similar  studies  and  their  findings, \nrecommendation, and lessons learned. \n \n(v)  Task 5: Assess and propose/ recommend Energy modernization scheme \noptimal to the selected SMTs in northern and southern PRC. The optimal \ntechnical/  economic  models  aim  to  ensure  sufficient  energy  supply,  improve \nenergy efficiency, reduce pollutant and carbon emission, and lower energy supply \ncost in SMTs. The models include least-cost technical design of modern and low-\ncarbon energy supply infrastructure, taking into consideration the local condition \nand asset. The models include necessary policy modification, which provides \npreferential treatment to the project, and energy supply service practice including \ninnovative financing mechanism like blockchain. The consultant may explore the \npossible application of emerging technologies and operation practices like battery \nstorage, micro-grid, and demand response service using virtual power plants. The \nconsultant may propose innovative business model of energy supply service, e.g. \nestablishing an energy supply enterprise to install and operate the modern and \nlow-carbon energy supply infrastructure at the service district. Proper incentive for \nprivate enterprises would achieve subsidy-free and profitable business of low-\ncarbon energy installation and operation. \n \nTo  transform  the  energy  supply  landscape  in  under-developed  SMTs,  the \nconsultant is expected to propose innovative low-carbon energy supply model. For \nthis purpose, the supply boundary can be expanded from individual buildings to \ndistrict-wide. This would enable integrated industrial approach, covering not only \nelectricity demand but also space heating as well as transportation demand, further \nindustrial end-users. In order to achieve subsidy-free sustainable energy supply \nbusiness, the consultant is expected to propose risk-hedging scheme, achieving \nintegrated energy service model. The service model would examine the service \nprovider\u2019s financing scheme, revenue channels, and the others to enable their \nbusiness  subsidy-free.  The  service  providers  would  contribute  to  net-zero \nemission districts in the selected SMTs. The idea is getting popular in large urban \ncities.  \n \n \n5 (a) ADB. 2007.
