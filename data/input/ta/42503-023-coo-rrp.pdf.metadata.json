I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the Cook Islands for subprogram 2 of the Economic Recovery Support \nProgram (ERSP).1 \n \n2.  Subprogram 2 will build on subprogram 1, which facilitated infrastructure investment in a \nperiod  of  constrained  revenue,  leveraged  improvement  in  priority-setting  processes  for \ninfrastructure investments, strengthened aspects of public financial management (PFM), and \nraised the policy profile of vulnerability issues.2 Subprogram 2 will further support government \nbudget priorities, and will promote public sector reforms and measures that will help protect the \nvulnerable and safeguard the fiscal position of the Cook Islands to promote higher and more \ninclusive economic growth. Subprogram 2 was jointly prepared by representatives from the \nGovernment of the Cook Islands and the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The Cook Islands undertook major public sector and economic reforms in 1995 and \n1996, with ADB support, in response to a financial crisis that had its basis in an expanding \npublic sector, a limited private sector, and a rapidly increasing debt burden.3 The reforms \nfacilitated annual growth averaging 6.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) from FY1999 to \nFY2004. However, minimal infrastructure investment (influenced by the need to reduce debt), \nthe impact of several cyclones, high inflation, and weak public sector performance resulted in a \nsubsequent  slowdown.  Reduced  revenue  from  tourism  due  to  the  global  economic  crisis \ncontributed to an economic contraction in FY2009.4  \n \n4.  Subprogram 1 of the ERSP, approved in October 2009, allowed the government to raise \ncapital expenditure in FY2010\u2013FY2012. This provided much-needed economic stimulus through \nsupport for infrastructure investment and maintenance of public buildings, supporting economic \ngrowth in FY2010 (0.2%), FY2011 (2.4%), and FY2012 (3.4%). Subprogram 1 also facilitated \nstrengthening of infrastructure priority-setting processes, improved broad budgetary resource \nallocations,  allowed  the  preservation  of  the  real  value  of  welfare  payments  to  the  most \nvulnerable through FY2010, leveraged commitment to strengthening the social welfare system, \nand supported greater public access to information.  \n \n5.  There  is  potential  for  stronger  economic  performance.  The  tourism  industry\u2014which \nattracts  around  100,000  visitors  annually,  almost  nine  times  the  resident  population\u2014is \nhampered by poor infrastructure. High-quality water supply and sanitation is essential to protect \nthe natural environment (the prime tourist attraction of the Cook Islands), as well as being vital \nto the health of the population. Roads, airports, and power infrastructure need upgrading. \nAddressing these constraints is essential to increasing economic growth.  \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2009.

The government has incrementally strengthened its budget process and prioritized social \nexpenditures\u2014in  FY2013,  12.3%  of budget resources  are  directed  to education,  10.8%  to \nhealth, and 14.5% to internal affairs (responsible for social welfare and gender issues). The \nFY2013  capital  plan  presents  resourcing  for  a  3-year  capital  investment  program,  which \nunderpins the economic outlook (see table).  \n \nEconomic Outlook, FY2012\u2013FY2015 \n \nItem  FY2012 (e)  FY2013 (f)  FY2014 (f)  FY2015 (f) \nReal GDP (% change) a  3.4  2.0  1.0  0.5 \nInflation (%)  3.0  3.0  3.0  3.0 \nBudget deficit (% of GDP)  2.2  2.3  1.6  5.7 \nPersonnel costs (% of total revenue)  43.1  43.1  41.2  39.1 \nNet debt (% of GDP)  12.7  18.3  16.8  15.5 \nNominal GDP (NZ$ million)  369.8  388.3  403.8  417.9 \n (e) = estimate, (f) = forecast, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product. \na  This presents the government\u2019s forecast of GDP as at June 2012.

Subprogram 2 will build on the gains of subprogram 1 and directly support economic \nrecovery combined with protection of the most vulnerable and the fiscal position. Loan financing \nwill help meet the government\u2019s overall financing needs for priority infrastructure. A continued \nrise  in  the  standard  of  infrastructure  sector  governance  is  supported  with  the  addition  of \ncomplementary  policy  action  on  public  sector  reform.  Fiscal  safeguards  are  reinforced  to \npreserve fiscal sustainability and sustain expansion in capital expenditure, while paying special \nattention to the needs of the vulnerable. The development policy letter and policy matrix for \nsubprogram 2 are in Appendixes 3 and 4.  \n \n8.  Subprogram 2  strengthens  the  partnership  between  ADB  and  the  Cook  Islands  by \nreinforcing progress in areas where ADB has been active over a period of time\u2014infrastructure, \nPFM, and public sector reform. The focus of subprogram 2 reforms are areas identified in the \ncountry partnership strategy, 2008\u201320125 and are anchored in Te Kaveinga Nui, the country's \nlong-term  strategic  plan.6 Lessons  identified  during  subprogram 1  implementation\u2014placing \npriority on promoting country ownership and keeping the program manageable, given capacity \nlimitations\u2014are reflected in subprogram 2.7 Subprogram 2 supports the government\u2019s reform \nprogram  in  coordination  with  the  European  Union  and  New  Zealand  (active  development \npartners), and completes the program reform agenda under the ERSP.  \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2008.

Rarotonga.  \n7  The design of subprogram 2 incorporates lessons from subprogram 1 (para. 7) and from policy-based lending in \nthe Pacific region and elsewhere. The focus is on a systematic approach to improving policy and planning capacity. \nNew structures and processes can erode country ownership and have therefore been avoided. Country ownership \nis facilitated by a program of simple scope and within country capacity. The Economic Recovery Support Program \nas a whole encourages broad participation by being anchored in earlier planning and analytical work, which was \nprepared with the benefit of broad-based engagement. Key sources of lessons are: ADB. 2009. Special Evaluation \nStudy: ADB\u2019s Support for Public Sector Reforms in the Pacific: Enhance Results through Ownership, Capacity, and \nContinuity.

During preparation of subprogram 1 in 2009, 18 triggers were identified as expected \nprior actions for subprogram 2. Consultation with the government on the evolution of priorities \nand the reform context finalized 17 prior policy actions for subprogram 2 (Appendix 4). The \nfunctional review of the public service and development of a PFM reform program were not \nenvisaged during preparation of subprogram 1. However, they have been included as prior \npolicy  actions  as  they  demonstrate  strengthened  government  reform commitment,  and the \nfunctional  review  directly  supports  output 2,  and  development  of  a  PFM  reform  program \nsupports output 4. Three output 2 triggers were adjusted as these were translated into policy \nactions, given changes in priorities and the policy environment, while two output 4 triggers were \ndropped as their priority was judged to be less critical to the effectiveness of the program. \nDetails of these changes are set out in paras. 12 and 19. All of the agreed 17 prior policy \nactions have been fully accomplished.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The ERSP will achieve higher and more inclusive economic growth (ERSP impact), and \nwill initiate economic recovery with protection of the vulnerable and the country\u2019s fiscal position \n(ERSP  outcome).  The  impact  of  subprogram 2  will  be  economic  recovery  combined  with \nprotection of the most vulnerable and the fiscal position. Subprogram 2 will strengthen priority \nelements  of  the  governance  and  institutional  framework  and  improve  opportunities  for  the \nvulnerable. ADB financing will support the government\u2019s overall budget financing needs, which \nhave  increased  as  a  result  of  its  greater  need  for  investment  in  infrastructure  and  public \nbuildings. The outcome will be sustainable budget allocations for needed capital investment and \nsocial protection.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n11.  Output 1: Higher capital expenditure by government. Budget support will enable the \ngovernment  to  implement  its  FY2013  development  expenditure  program,  particularly \ninfrastructure and capital works, which will generate jobs and business activity and create a \nsustainable base for a higher level of long-term growth driven by the private sector. This was \nalso the case with subprogram 1 financing of the FY2010 budget. Policy-based loan funds \nsupplement weak public sector capacity so as to leverage use of available investment funds. \n \n12.  Heightened  quality  of  capital  expenditure  was  facilitated  by  the  infrastructure \nprioritization process adopted under subprogram 1.8 Since FY2010, prioritization of projects into \nthe infrastructure master plan is undertaken by the infrastructure committee and is endorsed by \nthe National Sustainable Development Commission (NSDC).9 This process promotes quality \nprojects,  transparent  decision  making,  and  alignment  with  the  National  Sustainable \nDevelopment Plan (NSDP).10 The FY2013 adoption of a capital plan has further strengthened \nthe quality of capital expenditure.  \nA\n  p\np\ne\nn\nd\n                                                 ix\n8  As part of subprogram 1, the cabinet endorsed a process by which projects are prioritized based on multicriteria    4\nanalysis reflecting economic, social (including impact on living standards, community involvement, and equity), and \nenvironmental considerations, and are subject to a socioeconomic cost\u2013benefit analysis to verify their viability.  \n9  The cabinet-appointed NSDC includes heads of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM), the  3\n \nOffice of the Prime Minister, the Office of the Attorney General, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Its composition \nwas broadened in December 2011 to include representatives from the private sector, civil society, and communities \n(with particular attention paid to the representation of women and youth), further strengthening consideration of \nsocial criteria in setting priorities.  \n10 This output 1 prior action has been developed from trigger 2.1.  \n ", "4 \n13.  Output 2: Priority structural reforms and governance improvements implemented \nacross the infrastructure sectors. The 2008 infrastructure governance framework (a set of \ngovernment-initiated  policy  principles  and  actions  designed  to  achieve  sound  governance, \ninvestment decisions, and operational management in the infrastructure sector) guided the \nidentification  of  triggers for  subprogram 2.  However,  the  March  2011  commencement  of  a \nfunctional review of the public sector meant planned legislative and asset management changes \n(trigger 2.2), and consideration of monopoly ownership and management (triggers 2.3 and 2.4), \nwere postponed until after the functional review. The government response to the functional \nreview is prioritized in the prior policy actions as this supports achievement of the intended \noutput. The cabinet considered the recommendations of the functional review and approved a \nfocus on productivity and performance in the public sector and support for the performance \nmanagement process. The cabinet also prioritized phased implementation of recommendations \non outer islands. The Office of Outer Islands has been established within the Office of the Prime \nMinister and is empowering local governments through legislative reform and capacity building.  \n \n14.  Improvements in infrastructure governance have continued under subprogram 2. The \nNSDP 2011\u20132015 was released in December 2011 and includes infrastructure sector objectives \nand strategies that guide ministerial business plans and budget allocations. In keeping with the \nnational gender policy,11 the NSDP has a mainstreamed gender perspective, and equity is one \nof its seven guiding principles. Implementation of the infrastructure master plan, 2007\u20132012 was \nreviewed in August 2011 to assess progress in meeting infrastructure priorities, as well as to \noffer recommendations on future infrastructure delivery. A renewable electricity chart supports \nNSDP implementation, while the cabinet has approved a water policy standard.  \n \n15.  The fiscal implications of infrastructure services are addressed under subprogram 2. The \ngovernment financed an independent economic review of the impact of its existing 3-year \nagreement to underwrite losses on Air New Zealand\u2019s nonstop Los Angeles\u2013Rarotonga and \nSydney\u2013Rarotonga routes.12 The review assessed the likely performance and profitability of the \nsubsidized routes as input to government decisions on future support, or otherwise, for these \nroutes.13 The cabinet has considered cost recovery and user charges and agreed in principle to \napplying these charges to provision of water to households and businesses on Rarotonga (the \ntourism center, where 74% of the population is located), and to specific charges in respect of \nsanitation in the environmentally sensitive Muri\u2013Avana lagoon area of Rarotonga.14 For the \nFY2013 budget, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) developed a \ntransparent process for financing community service obligations.15  \n \n16.  The government has acted to reduce market impediments that constrain private sector \noperations and/or impose social costs. The Cook Islands has operated an extensive regime of \nprice controls covering most basic food items and fuel with the intention of keeping key items \naffordable. These controls can, however, force overall prices up, shifting profit margins between \nitems rather than reducing the overall cost of consumer items. The Prices Tribunal revoked \n                                                \n11  Government  of  the  Cook  Islands.  2011.

Output  3:  The  most  vulnerable  members  of  the  community  receive  targeted \nsupport from government. The Cook Islands has one of the most extensive social welfare \nsystems in the Pacific region, yet it does not fully meet the needs of the most vulnerable \npeople.17 Demographic forecasts indicate the likelihood of increased pressure on the social \nwelfare system. In 2010 an independent consultant undertook a review of the social welfare \nsystem for the government with the objective of recommending how to maintain an affordable \nwelfare system that better targets assistance. The government had committed to this review \nunder subprogram 1 and released the results publicly. The cabinet established a committee to \ndevelop, with wide consultation, a response to the report for government consideration.18 This \nemphasis on consultation reflects recognition that social welfare system reforms may have long-\nterm direct social impacts, including on gender relations. \n \n18.  Direct service provision to the vulnerable is being piloted, with ADB support.19 Home \ncare services are being provided to the elderly and disabled through local community-based \ngroups. Such support is of particular benefit to women, who comprise an estimated 80% of in-\nhome caregivers. The performance of the pilot is being monitored and performance against \noutcome and outputs will provide information for the design of social welfare reforms.  \n \n19.  Output  4:  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Economic  Management  maintains  fiscal \nresponsibility. The economic contraction in FY2009, and the change in government in the \nNovember 2010 elections, provided strong impetus for improvement of PFM systems. Under \nsubprogram 2, the government has increased its commitment to fiscal responsibility. A public \nexpenditure and financial accountability (PEFA) assessment,20 which independently assessed \nthe strengths and weaknesses in PFM performance, guided the development of the PFM road \nmap for FY2012\u2013FY2015. The PEFA performance indicators provide the baseline against which \nPFM reforms are monitored quarterly, with a second PEFA assessment planned by June 2015, \nallowing the system\u2019s improvements to be measured. The first quarterly monitoring report was \ncompleted  in  February  2012.  These  actions  provide  a  comprehensive  framework  for  PFM \nimprovements, and as such replace lower priority subprogram 2 triggers\u2014review of Payments \non Behalf of the Crown and retaining Standard & Poor\u2019s rating service21\u2014as prior policy actions.  \n \n20.  Under subprogram 2, the government continues to meet the principles of responsible \nfiscal management set out in the MFEM Act (Section 23[2][a]) so as to promote sound PFM \nthrough the budget process.22 The fiscal responsibility ratios, set as part of subprogram 1, are \n                                                \n16 The Prices Tribunal is established under the Control of Prices Act, 1966 and its functions include fixing prices for \ngoods and services provided in the act. The current three-person tribunal was appointed by the minister for internal \naffairs in November 2010 and has been requested to review the list of price-controlled goods.   \n17 The vulnerable comprise the elderly, unemployed, single parents, children, disabled, and squatters.   A\n18 The committee comprises the secretaries of the MFEM, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Health, Ministry of  pp\ne\nEducation, Office of the Prime Minister, and Solicitor-General of Crown Law. In addition, as required, the committee  n\nd\nincludes the secretaries of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration and a  ix\nrepresentative from civil society.    4\n19  ADB. 2010.

The government has set out a credible \nplan to move within the overall budget deficit\u2013GDP ratio (+/-2%) in FY2014 and the personnel \nexpenditure to total revenue ceiling (40%) by FY2015, the latter supported by implementing the \nfunctional review recommendations.  \n \n21.  The medium-term budget framework continues to be strengthened and provides a clear \npresentation  of  the  full  costs  of  ongoing  policies  to  better  inform  the  cabinet\u2019s  resource \nallocation decisions. The FY2011 budget provided a statement of the government\u2019s operations \nin  accordance  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  government  finance  statistics \nstandards to enable consistency in budget analysis, including across countries. The government \nadopted the IMF government finance statistics presentation for the FY2013 budget (and FY2012 \nout-turn). The inclusion of aid-funded work programs within the outcomes and key deliverables \nof ministry and agency business plans further strengthens the budget\u2013planning link and places \nperformance responsibility for these with the heads of ministries or agencies.  \n \n22.

The government is \nhighly supportive of consultative policy development and demonstrated this by encouraging \npublic submissions to the budget process for FY2013 as well as holding a public economic \nsummit, and public consultation during development of the NSDP 2011\u20132015, the public service \nfunctional review, and the social welfare review.  \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n \n23.  The government has requested a loan of NZ$7,250,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance subprogram 2, to be provided as a single tranche on completion of \nprior actions. The loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, straight line \nrepayment  method,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. Based on this, the \naverage loan maturity is 9.25 years, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. \n \n24.  The loan size was determined after consideration of (i) the estimated impact of the \nglobal economic crisis and the projected deficit financing requirements for the FY2013 national \nbudget,  estimated  at  $7.4  million;  (ii) the  availability  of  additional  funding  from  other \ndevelopment partners in the event the government is unable to meet this financial requirement; \n(iii) the  significance  and  complexity  of  the  policy  actions  of  the  ERSP,  and  the  budgetary \nresources and political capital required to implement the program successfully; and (iv) the \n                                                                                                                                                       \nachieved, the total operating expenses of the Crown in each financial year are less than its total operating \nrevenues in the same financial year; (ii) achieving and maintaining levels of Crown net worth that provide a buffer \nagainst factors that may impact adversely on the Crown's net worth in the future; (iii) managing prudently the fiscal \nrisks facing the Crown; and (iv) pursuing policies that are consistent with a reasonable degree of predictability \nabout the level and stability of tax rates for future years. \n23 The cabinet adopted the current fiscal responsibility ratios in December 2009. These updated the similar (but \nexpired) ratios the Cook Islands had committed to meeting under the 1998 Manila Agreement.  \n ", "7 \nconformity of the ERSP with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (footnote 5). The determination \nof loan size took into account the government\u2019s demonstrated commitment to implement a \nreform agenda, as evidenced by the policy actions achieved from 2009 to date. \n \n25.  Infrastructure  forms  a  significant  component  of  the  government\u2019s  development \nexpenditure program\u2014roads, water supply, and renewable energy are current priorities. Recent \nsignificant projects include upgrading Rarotonga International Airport, expanding Aviatui Port, \nand reconstructing outer island harbors. Project implementation sits with line ministries and \nstate-owned enterprises. The capital plan, adopted with the FY2013 budget, increases the \ntransparency of capital investment and further enhances sector coordination, and notes that \nannual capital expenditure will average NZ$55 million over FY2012\u2013FY2015.24  \n \n26.  Other key development expenditures relate to implementation of the PFM roadmap, \nimplementation of reforms arising from the functional review of the public sector, and changes to \nthe social welfare system coming out of the review of social welfare. There are also expected to \nbe nonfinancial costs in terms of the political capital required to maintain public support to \nsuccessfully implement these reforms. The return will initially be in the form of administrative \nsavings as a result of PFM reforms, with administrative savings from public sector reforms being \nlikely in 2\u20133 years as organizational changes show results. Improvements in infrastructure \ngovernance arrangements should hasten implementation of infrastructure projects and facilitate \nrevenue raising from infrastructure services such as water supply. The benefits of social welfare \nreform will be realized through reduced future social welfare expenditures as a targeted system \ntakes effect, as well as improvement in the individual financial situation of the most vulnerable.  \n \n27.  Implementation of subprogram 1 has been a positive experience for the Cook Islands \n(para. 4). It has allowed for an increase in its capital expenditure and further strengthened \ninfrastructure management. Subprogram 1 has permitted a better understanding of capacity \nweaknesses and informed discussion with government on how best to address the impact this \nmay  have  on  implementation  of  subprogram 2.  More  broadly,  ADB\u2019s  portfolio  in  the  Cook \nIslands is performing well and progress is being made towards targets in the country partnership \nstrategy results framework. The proposed loan size is within the established lending allocation, \nand is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan.25  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n28.  The MFEM will be the executing agency, and will oversee policy, legal, and regulatory \nactions, and ensure that the reforms agreed to by the government and ADB are duly carried out. \nThe ERSP spans 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012, with the subprogram 2 implementation \nperiod running from 1 March 2010 to 31 December 2012. ADB\u2019s grant and technical assistance \nprojects have helped the government meet tranche conditions.26 The MFEM will be responsible \nfor  overall  implementation  of  subprogram 2,  including  all  policy  actions,  administration  of \nA\nsubprogram 2,  disbursements,  and  maintenance  of  all  records.  The  NSDC  (the  ERSP  p\np\ncoordinating  committee)  will  meet  at  least  quarterly  to  monitor  progress  and  oversee  en\nd\nimplementation, and guide and direct the activities of the MFEM.   ix\n 4\n \n                                                \n24  Government of the Cook Islands. 2012.

The proceeds of the loan will be disbursed to the Cook Islands as the recipient according \nto ADB\u2019s simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for policy-based loans. \nThe proceeds will be used to finance items produced and procured in ADB member countries, \nand items in the list of ineligible items and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral \nsources are excluded. Loan proceeds disbursed against imports will require a certificate from \nthe government stipulating that the value of total imports of the Cook Islands, minus its imports \nfrom  nonmember  countries,  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other  official \ndevelopment assistance, is at least equal to the amount of the loan to be disbursed during a \nparticular year. Local currency generated from the proceeds of the loan will be used to support \npublic expenditure objectives under the ERSP. \n \n30.  In accordance with the simplified disbursement procedures and related requirements for \nprogram loans, all goods and services produced and originating in ADB member countries will \nbe procured with due consideration to economy and efficiency and in compliance with the \ngovernment\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  and  normal  private  sector  commercial  practices \nacceptable to ADB. Goods commonly traded on the international commodity market will be \nprocured according to procedures appropriate to the trade and acceptable to ADB. Before \nwithdrawal, the government will nominate a deposit account with the Bank of Cook Islands to \nreceive the loan proceeds. The account will be managed, operated, and liquidated according to \nterms satisfactory to ADB. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds, and to \nverify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic \n \n31.  The economy is rebuilding slowly from the external shock felt in 2009, with a return to \ngrowth in FY2010. The envisaged impact of the reforms is a permanent shift to a higher level of \ngrowth, facilitated by improved government efficiency and an ability to allocate a larger share of \nthe budget to nonpersonnel expenditure (improved quality of public expenditure). The faster \npace of revenue growth, through greater cost recovery and a growing tax base, will enable \nimproved government service provision, and welfare reforms will promote equitable growth. The \nimpact of these changes will become more pronounced in the medium term. However, based on \npast experience, maintaining strong growth will require active public sector management. The \nbenefits will be shared by all, but will be particularly felt by the vulnerable. \n \n32.  Through fiscal prudence, the government is prioritizing macroeconomic stability, and the \nresilience of the economy will be strengthened. A macroeconomic assessment, undertaken by \nADB staff, replaces an IMF letter of comfort (the Cook Islands is not an IMF member).27  \n \nB.  Governance \n \n33.  The government\u2019s ability to implement its budget is integral to the success of the ERSP. \nIn 2011, PEFA found that the PFM system is centered on a set of relatively advanced budget \nand financial management rules and structures around a clear legislative framework, and the \nrules are well documented. Compliance with these rules and processes in many areas is high, \nwhile in others, limited capacities constrain the government\u2019s ability to implement processes \n                                                \n27 Macroeconomic Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). While the external \nreview and advice typically received through an IMF Article IV mission is not available, the PEFA process and \ngovernment contracting of Standard & Poor\u2019s rating services provide external scrutiny of economic management.  \n ", "9 \nefficiently. The subsequent PFM reform plan resources the updating of annual accounts and \ntargets June 2013 for all the annual audited accounts to be updated. \n \n34.  More broadly, the performance of the public sector as a whole is constrained by weak \ncapacity and a fragmented structure. However, actions to improve functional arrangements and \nthe legislative environment, supplement capacity, and better manage the performance of state-\nowned  enterprises  can  be  expected  to  show  improvements.  Recent  political  stability  has \nenabled commencement of needed governance reforms. It has also seen increased efforts to \npromote transparency as well as consultation and participation by all stakeholders.28 \n \n35.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as  amended  to  date)  was  explained  to,  and \ndiscussed  with,  the  government  and  the  MFEM.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive or coercive practices relating to the \nprogram.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  are \nincluded in the loan agreement. These measures will complement the actions under way to \nimprove financial accountability and anticorruption measures, which are being put in place by \nthe government with the support of its development partners.  \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n \n36.  Although the Cook Islands has the highest GDP per capita of all Pacific developing \nmember countries ($9,838 in 2011), vulnerable groups can experience hardship. Women have \nrelatively restricted opportunities for economic and political participation and a generally lower \nearning capacity, and are impacted by subtle gender bias. Policy actions have been selected to \npromote poverty reduction and social development, and these form part of the government\u2019s \nown policy agenda set out in the NSDP (footnote 6). Policy actions that directly target the \nvulnerable will disproportionally benefit women, who are overrepresented among the vulnerable \nand bear the burden of infirm family members.29 \n \n37.  Beyond the general benefits from increased economic growth and new private sector job \nopportunities,  several  actions  provide  direct  social  and  gender  benefits:  (i) the  NSDP  has \nmainstreamed  gender  issues,  as  required  by  the  national  policy  on  gender  equality \n(footnote 11); (ii) underfunding of selected infrastructure services, and resultant nonexistent or \npoor quality services, is being addressed through consideration and implementation of user \ncharges, which include social considerations to ensure vulnerable groups are able to access \nthese  essential  services;  (iii)   use  of  a  standard  approach  to  funding  community  service \nobligations  will  enable  support  for  access  to  such  social  services  to  be  better  targeted; \n(iv)  removal of price controls on grocery and laundry products should quickly provide for a \ngreater choice of products (of various qualities and prices); (v) vulnerable members of the \ncommunity will specifically benefit from home support services to the elderly and disabled; \nA\n(vi)  review of social welfare benefits has the objective of improving targeting; and (vii) improved  p\np\ncommunity outreach and engagement will engender community participation and feedback in  en\nd\npolicy design, and will support the direct involvement of women in decision making.  ix\n 4\n   \n \n9\n \n                                                \n28  Further assessment is available in the Sector Assessment (Summary): Public Sector Management (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n29 As of December 2011, women formed 82% of the recipients of welfare payments for the destitute and care givers.  \n ", "10 \nD.  Safeguards \n \n38.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), subprogram 2 is classified \ncategory C,  with  no  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  identified.  No  involuntary \nresettlement or impact on indigenous people is expected.  \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n39.  The potential benefits from ameliorating the impacts of the global economic crisis and \nproviding a solid foundation for future growth through structural and governance initiatives are \nconsidered to outweigh the risks.30 Indeed, the costs of inaction could be substantial, i.e., a \ncontinued low growth rate, with implications for the government\u2019s ability to fund basic social \nservices  and  address  environmental  concerns.  The  following  are  major  risks:  (i) negative \nexternal  shocks  damage  the  economy,  (ii) parliamentary  and  community  support  for  the \ngovernment\u2019s economic management weakens, (iii) government capacity to implement reform \nprogram  is  insufficient,  and  (iv) the  government  fails  to  prioritize  capital  works  based  on \neconomic  returns.  These  will  be  mitigated  by  support  from  development  partners  for  the \ngovernment\u2019s fiscal consolidation efforts, including elements of subprogram 2 and the use of its \nloan  funds  to  supplement  capacity,  continuing  the  infrastructure  prioritization  process,  and \nimplementing a communications and engagement strategy. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCE \n \n40.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the ERSP shall conform to all \napplicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards, \ngender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in the loan \ndocuments.  Indicators  and  benchmark  levels  to  monitor  the  outputs  and  outcome  of \nsubprogram 2 will be developed by the NSDC to align with its own ongoing monitoring of NSDP \nimplementation, but will be inclusive of those contained in the design and monitoring framework \nfor the ERSP and for subprogram 2.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n41.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based loan would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and, acting in the absence of the President, \nunder the provisions of Article 35.1 of the Articles of Agreement of ADB, I recommend that the \nBoard approve the loan of NZ$7,250,000 to the Cook Islands for subprogram 2 of the Economic \nRecovery  Support  Program,  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  with  interest  to  be \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; for a term of 15 years, including a grace period of 3 years; and such other terms and \nconditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement \npresented to the Board. \n \n \nBindu N.
