INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program member countries \nare committed to a shared vision for the region\u2019s energy sector. This vision will enable all \nmember  countries  to  have  access  to  adequate  volumes  of  reliable,  affordable,  financially \nsustainable, and environmentally sound commercial energy. It requires the implementation of \nconsistent policies to ensure (i) energy security through balanced development of the region\u2019s \nenergy resources, infrastructure, and institutions; (ii) stronger integration of the region\u2019s energy \nmarkets; and (iii) economic growth through energy trade. Within this framework, the Strategy \nand  Work  Plan  (2016\u20132020)  for  Regional  Cooperation  in  the  Energy  Sector  of  CAREC \nCountries aims to promote new technologies and remove market barriers for the adoption of \nnew technology in the region.1  \n \n2.  CAREC countries are slow in adopting new technologies because of both supply and \ndemand constraints. On the supply side, suppliers of new technologies are not attracted to \nCAREC countries as a market because the countries are relatively poor and difficult to access, \nand,  in  many  cases,  suppliers  are  not  familiar  with  the  countries.  On  the  demand  side, \ngovernment policies and regulations are not enabling new technologies, as the institutions in \nthese countries lack the capacity and understanding of new technologies. New technology \nadoption  is  also  affected  by  the  perceived  risk,  resistance  from  the  incumbents,  and  the \nnegative image created by substandard new technology products in the nascent market.  \n \n3.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  build  capacities  through  targeted  training, \ndemonstration projects, and knowledge products.2 The overall scope of the TA was endorsed by \nthe  CAREC  Energy  Sector  Coordinating  Committee  (ESCC),  which  will  analyze  the  new \ntechnology landscape and develop a technology adoption road map for faster integration of new \ntechnology into existing systems in the region. The road map will include analysis of business \nmodels, and policy incentives for faster new technology adoption and scale-up.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \nA.  New Technology and the Electricity Industry  \n \n4.  Energy sector facing major changes. The monopoly facets of electricity generation \nand distribution that faced very little technological development since Thomas Edison invented \nelectricity  some  140  years  ago  are  changing.  Renewable  energy  has  become  a  proven \ntechnology for mass adoption, and is competing against fossil fuel generation on price in many \ndeveloped and developing countries. The International Energy Agency recently reported an \nunprecedented  cost  reduction\u2014the  average  cost  of  land-based  wind-generated  electricity \ndecreased by 35% and solar energy fell by almost 80% from 2008 to 2015.4  The integration of \nrenewable energy can significantly alter the power system paradigms of the CAREC countries\u2014\nboth fossil fuel-rich Central Asia with full electrification and energy-deficit South Asia where a \nlarge population still has no access to electricity.  \n \n                                                \n1  CAREC. 2015.

Next Generation Wind and Solar Power: From Cost to Value. Paris.           \nhttps://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/NextGenerationWindandSolarPower.pdf. \n \n ", "2   \n5.  Renewables to lower electricity costs. With recent advances in battery technology \nand lower prices of solar and wind power, the cost of operating dispersed generation and mini-\ngrids is becoming cheaper than isolated diesel-only generation. If reputable suppliers of solar or \nwind power and battery providers are attracted to the CAREC region, the cost of local mini-grids \nwith  renewable  energy  could  be  cheaper  and  more  reliable  than  local  diesel  generation \nespecially in far-flung sparsely populated areas connected to the main grid. In remote rural \nAfghanistan  and  Pakistan,  the  solar  generation  and  battery  combination  could  increase \nelectricity access with lower prices, using either a micro-grid for small communities or off-grid \nDC kits for individual houses at a fraction of the cost and time of expanding the grid.  \n \n6.  Smart grid and storage. Smart grid technology will integrate the power network with \ninformation technology and make the network more reliable and responsive to consumer needs. \nIt will be able to monitor and adjust consumers\u2019 energy use (and solar generation) through smart \nmeters. Battery-based storage at the community level will be able to reduce the overall load \nfactor, shift demand to off-peak periods, and strengthen the grid without building new power \nplant  distribution  lines  and  transformer  capacities  as  demand  for  electricity  grows.  In  the \nmedium term, the integration of electric vehicles may also improve reliability through vehicle-to-\ngrid connections.  \n \n7.  Old  lighting  technologies  in  roads,  highways,  and  public  facilities.  In CAREC \ncountries,  based  on  initial  observation  of  lighting  sources  and  old  lighting  design,  energy \nsavings of about 40%\u201380% are possible. With newer technologies, additional savings of about \n50%\u201375% are possible from the maintenance of street lighting. If forward-looking technology is \ntaken into account, additional savings will be possible: the scope of energy-efficient street \nlighting has widened from its traditional narrow scope of better equipment to the installation of \nsmart, energy-efficient street lighting. This involves a smart energy management system that \ndims when lights are not required, and can communicate real-time usage statistics and failures, \nallowing automatic and quicker repair requests and responses.   \n \n8.  Energy-efficient public buildings.  When most of the infrastructure in Central Asia was \nbuilt in the 1970s, central planners focused on delivering energy to meet the demand. Demand \nreduction and energy efficiency were only considered after the oil crisis in the late 1970s. The \npublic buildings in the region consume more energy than buildings in other parts of the world. A \ndemonstration project in Uzbekistan quantified significant energy savings potential in buildings: \n30%\u201345% from heat energy and 40%\u201365% overall energy savings. The CAREC countries have \nidentified energy savings in buildings as a key component for constructing better infrastructure \nin the future.  \n \n9.  Electrification of transport.  To improve energy security, oil-importing countries have \ndeveloped policies to increase the availability of oil or reduce oil demand. However, this has not \nmitigated their vulnerability to oil price fluctuations. In 2008, when oil prices were at a record \nhigh, countries focused on ethanol made from agricultural products like sugar cane and corn to \naddress energy security. Now, there is an alternative. Some countries are looking at electric \nvehicles as an alternative, with their growing popularity and the fact that these vehicles can run \non considerably lower-priced electricity generated by solar power. Most oil-importing countries \ngenerate very little electricity using oil, so electric cars and plug-in hybrid electric cars can have \nan  immediate  impact  on  oil  imports  and  energy  security.  The  strategic  importance  of  the \nelectrification of transport comes from a much lower cost per kilometer for electric vehicles \ncompared with the cost of fueling with gasoline or diesel, even when oil prices are low. This is a \nkey  strategic  issue  as  the  price  of  electric  cars  is falling  with  lower  battery  prices. Wider \ndeployment of electric vehicles and necessary transformation of transport electrification will not \n ", "  3 \nhappen without government intervention, especially in CAREC countries. Globally, governments \nare providing subsidies to fast-track the adoption of electric vehicles.  \n \n10.  Technology  modernization.  Bringing  in  new  technology  in  Central  Asia  is  more \ncomplex than in other regions because of the additional challenge of ensuring compatibility \nbetween the new and old systems. Most of the infrastructure in Central Asia was built with \nRussian technology and design in the 1970s during the Soviet Union era. With low investments \nsince the 1990s, the adoption of new technology is more complex and slower than in other \nregions, where new technologies have gradually been added.  \n \nB.  Slow Adoption of New Technologies \n \n11.  CAREC  governments  are  aware  of  the  slow  adoption  of  new  technologies  in  their \ncountries because of their conservative policy, lack of understanding of the merits of new \ntechnology, low supplier interest, and absence of standards to stop the proliferation of poor \nquality  products.  CAREC  member  countries  want  to  address  this  problem  and  stop  the \nproliferation of poor quality products. A strategic plan is needed to develop the market and \ncapacities to support new markets. The objective is to avoid the common 5\u20137-year time lag for \nthe adoption of new technologies, and implement technologies that are cheaper, more efficient, \nand have smaller carbon footprints.   \n \n12.  CAREC member countries acknowledge that the technology adoption gap is worsening \nas new technologies in the energy sector are developing faster than before. New technology \nowners and suppliers focus on the higher margins from early adopters\u2019 niche markets to recover \ntheir  technology  development  costs,  preventing  people  from  developing  countries  from \nassuming  technology  risks  and  becoming  early  adopters.  In  absence  of the  right  policies, \nincentives,  quality  standards,  and  information  to  encourage  diffusion  of  new  technologies, \ntechnology adoption level is less than what is socially desirable and optimum in the CAREC \ncountries. The overall time lag in technology adoption in CAREC, thus is a market failure that \nneeds addressing. \n \nC.  Technology Leapfrogging  \n \n13.  The CAREC ESCC members are thinking outside the linear approach of technology \nadoption to future-proof today\u2019s investments. CAREC member governments plan to jump from \nyesterday\u2019s  technology  to  tomorrow\u2019s  technology\u2014leapfrogging  the  mature  technologies  of \ntoday. In rural Afghanistan, India and Pakistan, many people jumped from old analog landlines \n(or no telephones) to smartphones\u2014leapfrogging digital landlines and analog mobile networks.   \n \n14.  Leapfrogging technology is a difficult strategy to implement. CAREC member countries \nmust determine what technology is relevant in the medium term from current technology trends. \nCountries  need  demonstration  projects  and  understanding  of  technology  trends.  The  next \nchallenge is to adopt policies and actions that will shorten the lag between the launch of \ntechnology  in  developed  countries  and  its  introduction  in  CAREC  countries.  The  ESCC \nenvisions four key disruptive technologies to lead tomorrow\u2019s changes: (i) battery-based energy \nstorage, (ii) solar power, (iii) electric vehicles, and (iv) energy-efficient appliances. CAREC \nmembers will need to revise energy planning methods and adjust distribution and transmission \nsystems to cope with these and other disruptive technologies already available in developed \ncountries. Inferior products made from the same technology are slowly becoming available in \nCAREC countries at significantly higher prices, as smaller niche markets emerge.  \n \n15.  Adoption of new technologies as a strategy. The ESCC identified this market failure \nas a developmental challenge. The adoption and use of new and efficient energy technologies \nand increased integration of energy markets is a key pillar of the CAREC energy sector strategy \nand work plan (footnote 1). The ESCC has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \n ", "4   \nfinance a regional TA to support technology leapfrogging. The proposed TA will bring the \ncapacity, knowledge, and skills for innovative approaches and planning.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The impact of the project is aligned with increased energy security among CAREC \ncountries through the promotion and use of new technologies. This is aligned with the Strategy \nand  Work  Plan  (2016\u20132020)  for  Regional  Cooperation  in  the  Energy  Sector  of  CAREC \nCountries (footnote 1). The outcome will be new technology applied to energy systems in \nCAREC countries.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n17.  The  TA  will  support  market  transformation  by  enabling  right  policies,  incentives, \nstandards, and knowledge through the following four outputs and key activities:  \n(i)  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation  new  technology  road  map \ndeveloped. This will reconfirm and prioritize commitments for new technologies, \nupdate the new technology vision to a more detailed new technology road map, \nand create a viable work plan and time line to be adopted by CAREC countries \nduring the CAREC Senior Officials\u2019 Meeting (SOM) in 2017. \n(ii)  Links among Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation countries toward \na unified regional market for investment and new technologies strengthened. \nThis will organize the second Energy Investment Forum as a follow-up to the first \nevent in Islamabad in October 2016, and publish information and proceedings on \nthe CAREC website. \n(iii)  Market  adoption  potential  of  new  technologies  demonstrated.  This  will \nconduct  consultations  and  ensure  the  completion  of  the  potential  pilot  project \n(including  size  and  location)  in  CAREC  countries,  complete  the  design  and \ntechnical specifications for pilot demonstration projects, implement pilot projects, \nestablish a monitoring and reporting mechanism, and evaluate and assess the \nscalability  of  pilot  implementation  (including  social  acceptability  and  financial \nsustainability).  \n(iv)  Capacity building on new technologies and electric vehicles developed. This \nwill  develop  a  CAREC-wide  communication  and  outreach  strategy,  including \nbranding, distributing communication plans across CAREC countries for country-\nlevel implementation, and creating a CAREC new technology project database. \n \n18.  The TA will achieve its outcome of new technology applied to energy systems in CAREC \ncountries. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nClean Energy Fund5 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility and administered by \nADB. The participating CAREC governments will provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart staff, office accommodation, secretarial assistance, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n                                                \n5  Financing partners: the governments of Australia, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. \n ", "  5 \n20.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA and will work closely with the country focal \npersons for the ESCC. The TA will be implemented over 24 months from January 2017 to \nDecember 2018. \n \n21.  ADB will oversee and lead the implementation of the TA, and will work closely with the \nCAREC coordinators in ADB resident missions in the pilot countries. A no objection will be \nsecured from each DMC in whose territory TA activities will be undertaken, at the latest before \nthe commencement or financing of any TA activity in such territory. The Energy Division of \nADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department and its team of consultants will organize internal \nseminars and workshops that will include other ADB staff members as resource persons. ADB \nwill engage all consulting services following its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time). \n \n22.  ADB will recruit several individual technical experts and an international consulting firm \nto develop the new technology road map. ADB will recruit 11 person-months of international \nindividual experts to form the international technology team and about 25 person-months of \nnational  consultants  to  coordinate  ESCC  meetings,  communications,  and  in-country \ncoordination. The individual consultants are justified since a consulting firm may not have key \nexperts on new technologies, and to keep the design-and implementation-related activities of \nthe  pilot  projects  in  separate  teams.  The  consulting  firm  will  deliver  31  person-months  of \nconsulting  services  (17  person-months  of  international  and  14  person-months  of  national \nconsulting inputs) following ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method with a 90:10 ratio \nand using a simplified technical proposal.  \n \n23.  Individual consultants or the consulting firm will procure equipment for the pilot. ESCC- \nrelated equipment will be retained by the secretariat. All procurement under the TA will be done \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time).  \n \n24.  ADB  may  establish  partnerships  with  renowned  technology  service  providers  or \nuniversities. The guiding principles for this partnership will include the following:  \n(i)  TA proceeds will not finance the staff costs, capitalization, or ordinary operating \nexpenses of partner(s), and will only finance the eligible individual\u2019s transportation \nand daily subsistence allowance. \n(ii)  Partner(s)  will  not  engage  consultant(s)  or  resource  person(s)  using  the  TA \nproceeds\u2014all consultants and/or resource persons to be financed by ADB using the \nproceeds  for  the  assignments  envisaged  and/or  proposed  in  the  partnership \nagreement will be engaged directly by ADB. \n(iii)  Capacity building and training for electric vehicles and batteries will be conducted in \npartnership  with  Tesla  Energy,  Hydro  Tasmania,  Australian  Renewable  Energy \nAssociation, and Argonne National Laboratory.  \n(iv)  The project team will continue its work to establish partnerships with large electric \ncar  companies,  electric  or  hybrid  bus  companies,  and  technical  and  innovation \nlaboratories of reputable universities for the pilot project.  \n(v)  Companies partnering with ADB for the pilot project will not be excluded from bidding \nfor the project if the new technology pilot project results in an investment for ADB.  \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n 25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $2,000,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Clean Energy Fund under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility \nfor  Leapfrogging  of  Clean  Technology  in  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic  Cooperation \nCountries through Market Transformation, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nIncreased energy security among CAREC countries through the promotion and use of new technologies \n(Strategy  and  Work  Plan  [2016\u20132020]  for  Regional  Cooperation  in  the  Energy  Sector  of  CAREC \nCountries)a  \nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nNew technology  1.
