THE ENSUING PROJECT \n1.  The proposed ensuing project will restore and improve connectivity between Dushanbe, \nthe northeast region of Tajikistan and the Kyrgyz Republic via the M41 highway, which is located \non Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) corridors 2, 3, and 5. The proposed \nproject will also serve about 13 villages and communities that presently rely on the existing M41 \nhighway for access to economic opportunities and social services. In addition, the proposed \nproject will continue strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Transport on road \nsafety and asset management. \n \n2.  The Obigarm\u2013Nurobod road section located on the CAREC corridors 2, 3, and 5 will be \ninundated once the HPP reservoir has filled to operating levels. The realignment of this road \nsection through the river valley is not part of the Rogun HPP project. A bypass road must be \ncompleted and opened to traffic by latest November 2023, the date by which the rising water in \nthe hydropower project reservoir will have inundated several critical sections of the existing M41 \nhighway. No other part of Tajikistan\u2019s national highway network can provide for this traffic, and \nthe only alternative route would represent a deviation of about 500 kilometer. \n \n3.  The outcome of the project will be connectivity, access, and safety on CAREC corridors \n2, 3, and 5 restored and improved. The project will be aligned with the following impacts: \n(i) economic growth promoted (Tajikistan National Development Strategy),1 and (ii) competitive \ncorridors across the CAREC region established (CAREC Program).2 The project outputs consist \nof (i) constructing the Obigarm\u2013Nurobod road (CAREC corridors 2, 3, and 5) and rural access \nroad, which is a strategically important international corridor, and (ii) strengthening the institutional \ncapacity of the Ministry of Transport on road safety and road asset management, both of which \nare critical to ensure social and financial sustainability. \n \n4.  The project is expected to cost about $400 million. The government has approached the  \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to \nhelp finance the project. The government will provide counterpart funding of about $70 million \nequivalent  to  cover  taxes  and  duties,  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  costs,  incremental \nadministrative expenses, financing charges, and other miscellaneous costs.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n5.  The  proposed  transaction  technical  assistance  (TRTA)  will  help  the  government  of \nTajikistan (the government) prepare the proposed ensuing project. The TRTA will ensure that the \nproject  will  be  prepared  to  acceptable  technical,  safeguards,  and  procurement  standards. \nThe ensuing project is expected to meet the \u201chigh readiness\u201d criteria before possible Board \nconsideration. \n \n   \n                                                \n1  Government of Tajikistan. 2017.

Output 1: Technical due diligence on ensuing project carried out. This output will \ninclude a due diligence of the design prepared by the national design consultant, proposing \namendments as necessary, to ensure the design is consistent with internationally-accepted \nstandards for such projects and suitable for ADB financing. \n \n7.  Output 2: Feasibility study on ensuing project prepared. This output will include \npreparing project cost estimates, preparing safeguards documentation for the environmental and \nsocial aspects of the project consistent with ADB\u2019s Safeguards Policy Statement 2009, and \npreparing a gender action plan following ADB\u2019s guidelines for such analyses. It will also include a \nscoping of the capacity development component envisaged under the ensuing project. \n \n8.  Output 3: Procurement support provided. This output will include preparing master and \ncontract specific bidding documents, assisting the government with obtaining government and \nADB approval of them, and preparing final versions of them for issue to potential bidders. It will \nalso include assisting the government with advertising the contracts, preparing and managing \npre-bid meetings and site visits, receiving bids, evaluation bids and preparing bid evaluation \nreports for government and ADB approval, negotiations with selected bidders, and finalizing \ncontract documentation for award \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $1,050,000 equivalent, of which $1 million will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of furnished office accommodation in Dushanbe and other \nin-kind contributions. \n \n10.  Additional consulting inputs may be required to complete the TRTA to its intended scope. \nShould this eventuate, a request for additional financing will be processed. The government was \ninformed that approval of the TRTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  ADB will administer the TRTA. CWTC will select, supervise and evaluate the consultants. \nThe implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  July 2018\u2013December 2019 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Transport \nImplementing agency  Project Implementation Unit for Roads Rehabilitation \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual consultant  International:  $795,000 \nselection  26 person-months \nDirect contracting (firm)  National:  $100,000 \n22 person-months \nResource persons  International:  $40,000 \n2 person-months \nProcurement  To be procured by consultants \nShopping  Equipment  $5,000 \nAdvance contracting  To expedite the conduct of TRTA, selection of key individual consultant \npositions will commence through advance contracting following PAI 2.04. \n ", "3 \nAspects  Arrangements \nNegotiation and signing of the consulting contract will only occur after the \nTRTA becomes effective. \nDisbursement  The TRTA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Equipment procured using TRTA funding will be turned over to the \narrangement upon TA completion  Executing Agency upon TRTA completion. \nADB= Asian Development Bank, PAI = Project Administration Instructions, TRTA = transaction technical assistance. \nSource: ADB staff estimates \n \n12.  Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.3 The consultants will procure the goods and equipment required to \nundertake the services. The TA will require approximately 28 person-months of international \nconsultants and 28 person months of national consultants\u2019 inputs. The consultants will provide \nexpertise in project management, procurement, road engineering, environment, resettlement, and \nsocial development. The summary of consultants\u2019 required inputs is in Table 2. \n \n13.  The international consultants will be recruited as individuals with output-based contracts, \nexcept for the team leader and procurement specialist (time-based). This approach is dictated by \nthe fixed schedule of the HPP inundation of the existing highway, which does not provide sufficient \ntime to recruit a firm to provide the services. The national consultants will be recruited as a firm \nthrough direct contracting given the very small consultancy assignment ($100,000) and the need \nto carry out specific environmental and social safeguards surveys. A team leader (international) \nand a deputy team leader (national) will be hired to ensure effective and timely coordination of all \nrequired inputs. In addition, two person months worth of resource person contracts (maximum 10 \nworking days each) will be reserved to allow inputs from highly specialized experts, particularly to \nsupport the preparation of the noise/vibration modelling and climate change assessment. \n \nTable 2: Summary of Consultants\u2019 Required Inputs \nInternational Positions  PMs  National Positions  PMs \nTeam Leader/Highway Engineer  6  Deputy Team Leader/Highway Engineer  6 \nStructural Engineer  3  Environment Specialist  5 \nTunnel Engineer  2  Social Development Specialist  5 \nGeotechnical Specialist  2  Translator  6 \nProcurement Specialist  5  Head office support  6 \nRoad Safety Specialist  1     \nEnvironment Specialist  4     \nSocial Development Specialist  3     \nResource persons  2     \n      Total  28    28 \n \n                                                \n3  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "4  Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \nItems  Amount \nAsian Development Banka   \n1.
