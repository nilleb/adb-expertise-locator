INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  Government  of  Nepal  asked  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  capacity \ndevelopment technical assistance (TA) to build skills, knowledge, and systems in the Town \nDevelopment Fund (TDF) for public\u2013private partnerships (PPP). ADB\u2019s country programming \nmission made a provision for the TA in April 2010. The country operations and business plan \n2011\u20132013 reconfirmed the processing of this TA.1 \n \n2.  An ADB fact-finding mission to Nepal from 20 to 24 September 2010 reached agreement \nwith the government on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, \nfinancing arrangements, and outline terms of reference for the TA. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Poor  infrastructure  is  a  critical  constraint  to  inclusive  economic  growth  in  Nepal. \nInfrastructure is grossly underdeveloped and many of the country\u2019s people lack access to basic \nservices. To meet the millennium development goals, and reach its objective of sustainable \ninclusive growth, it is estimated that Nepal must invest $40 billion in infrastructure over the \n2009\u20132025  period.  These  investment  needs  rose  rapidly  in  the  coming  years  due  to \ninfrastructure damage and construction delays during a prolonged civil conflict. At less than 4% \nof gross domestic product, Nepal\u2019s rate of spending on infrastructure is much lower than those \nin other countries in the region. Public financing is constrained by limited fiscal space and the \nhigh cost of post-conflict reconstruction efforts and cannot generate the necessary investments \nin  infrastructure  on  its  own.  Private  sector  participation  (PSP)  and  private  investment  are \nneeded to fill this financing gap if the infrastructure improvements critical to development and \npoverty reduction in Nepal are to be achieved.  \n \n4.  Private sector investment in Nepal\u2019s infrastructure has nonetheless been practically non-\nexistent. This is due mainly to (i) an inadequate policy and regulatory framework for attracting \nPSP in infrastructure, and (ii) limited financing entities dedicated to social infrastructure. Nepal is \nin great need of such entities because its commercial banks provide only short-term loans \nbacked  by  securities  and  collateral  and  lack  the  technical  and  business  skills  to  identify, \nappraise, and structure infrastructure projects that will attract PSP. \n \n5.  The government wants to develop the TDF\u2019s capacity for PPP operations to offset this \ninstitutional challenge and to respond to rapid urbanization and the expanding need for urban \ninfrastructure and better delivery of such urban services as sewerage, waste management, \nwater supply, and urban transport.  \n \n6.  The TDF was established under the Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) in \n1988. In 1995, it became a semiautonomous financial intermediary. Seed capital was provided \nunder German development cooperation through GTZ and augmented 2 years later with a soft \nloan from the World Bank. The Town Development Fund Act promulgated in 1997 gave the TDF \nmore autonomy, discretionary power, and authority. TDF operations aim (i) to improve basic \ninfrastructure and the delivery of public services in urban areas through long-term financing for \nsocial infrastructure and revenue-generating projects,  and (ii) to make municipalities and other \nrelevant organizations more technically, managerially, and financially able to identify, implement, \nand evaluate urban development projects. With  government approval, the TDF can obtain \nfinancial assistance from external donors or from within the country to carry out investment \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2010. Country Operations Business Plan: Nepal, 2011\u20132013. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 November 2010. \n ", "2   \nprojects. It is empowered to enter into loan or grant agreements with any urban development \ninstitution or agency with the agreement of the government and development partners. The TDF \nis  experiencing  low  rates  of  repayment  from  towns  due  to  their  inadequate  operations, \nmaintenance, and contract management capacity. This is a problem the TA will address. \n \n7.  The TDF has implemented projects funded by government contributions and by ADB, \nthe World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and under German \ndevelopment cooperation through GTZ and KfW. It has financed drinking water supply schemes, \nstorm water drainage systems, schools, hospitals, bus terminals, communal and access roads, \nmarkets, shopping complexes, town halls, other public buildings, and social and cultural centers \nin the country\u2019s 58 municipalities as well as in small and emerging towns. The TDF channeled \ncritical infrastructure grants and loans to municipalities as part of several ADB projects.3  \n \n8.  The  TDF  is  headed  by  an  executive  director  and  now  has  three  sections  and  33 \nemployees.  The  loan  and  grant  section  scrutinizes  applications  for  loans  and  appraises \napplications in accordance with the policies of various programs. The technical section oversees \ndetailed engineering. Finance and administration handles incoming funds and contributions, \ndisbursements, and repayments.  \n \n9.  The  TDF  board  has  approved  a  reorganization  to  make  the  fund\u2019s  structure  and \nmanagement system more process-oriented and able to absorb and dispense more financing \nand meet future infrastructure investment needs. GTZ and the World Bank are supporting this \ninstitutional development plan and the creation of a strategic TDF business plan by March 2011. \nUnder the new organization, to be implemented throughout 2011, the TDF will have a larger \nstaff of up to 56 employees and new divisions for (i) business development, (ii) building client \ncapacity,  (iii)  risk  and  fund  management,  (iv)  PPP  development,  and  (v)  information \nmanagement. The long-term business plan will aim to make the TDF a fully autonomous, \nfinancially sustainable communal infrastructure development bank. The TA will participate in this \nupgrading process, by building the TDF\u2019s capacity for PPP. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  the  increased  development  of  social  and  municipal \ninfrastructure through the greater involvement of the TDF, and more PPP arrangements. The \nimpact will be measured by the rise in municipal infrastructure investment as a percentage of \nNepal\u2019s gross domestic product and by the number of PPP deals as a percentage of the number \nof individual investments overall in municipal infrastructure. The TA outcome will be the TDF\u2019s \nstrengthened operational capacity and the more efficient services it will provide to municipalities, \nparticularly for PPP. Outcome indicators will include the number of municipalities seeking and \nobtaining support from the TDF and the number of regulations, guidelines, and standards issued \nby the government and the TDF through effective consultations with all relevant stakeholders. \n                                                \n3  ADB. 2000.

Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA has several expected outputs: \n \n12.  Sector  financing  policy  and  guidelines. On the  basis  of  the TDF\u2019s  new general \nlending and financing policy to be prepared along with the strategic business plan with the \nsupport of GTZ and the World Bank, this component will (i) review the proposed general policies \nand guidelines in detail; (ii) adapt the proposed lending policy to all urban sectors targeted by \nthe TDF;4 (iii) set up a framework for environmental and social safeguards in project financing; \nand (iv) consult with such stakeholders as private companies, legal firms, and commercial \nbanks to study how the TDF could be made less reliant on grants and soft lines of credit by \nraising its own revenue.  \n \n13.  Preparation for financing policy and guidelines for public\u2013private partnerships. \nThe preparation of TDF\u2019s PPP policy and guidelines will include (i) a review of existing national \npolicies and of small PPP practices and experience in Nepal to learn from their success or \nfailure, and (ii) a review of PPP financing systems in countries recognized for the best PPP \nframeworks and practices to draw possible lessons for the TDF. A regional field trip will be \norganized to visit similar financial intermediary institutions, probably in India, to study their \nbusiness models and learn how they could be applied to improve TDF operations. \n \n14.  Strengthened  capacity  for  project  evaluation  and  appraisal. This  component  is \nintended to enhance the TDF\u2019s capacity to structure viable projects and ensure repayment from \nits client municipalities and small towns. The component will (i) provide consulting services to \nenhance evaluation and appraisal procedures for all phases of project design (prefeasibility \nstudy,  feasibility  study,  and  detailed  engineering),  as  well  as  risk  management  and  cost \nrecovery for subprojects under ongoing ADB\u2013TDF undertakings (footnote 3); (ii) support the \ndevelopment of a manual on PPP structuring and project appraisal for new projects, such as the \nKathmandu Sustainable Urban Transport Project,5 for which the TDF will onlend part of ADB \nproceeds to private bus operators; and (iii) support the establishment of the TDF\u2019s new technical \nassistance and consulting services division and its new PPP promotion and PPP appraisal units \nthrough staff training in project finance, PPP, risk assessments, and financing products. Once \ntrained, TDF staff are to transfer their knowledge through the training of municipal employees \nwhen needed or requested, thereby fulfilling one of their duties under the TDF Act. \n \n15.  Preparation of two demonstration projects. Once the TDF\u2019s PPP financing policy is in \nplace and its manual on PPP structuring has been prepared, this component will test the fund\u2019s \nnew capacity by helping its staff design and structure two viable PPP projects. One project may \nbe  in  Kathmandu,  based  on  recommendations  made  by  the  TA  consultant  on  parking \ndevelopment, through the Kathmandu Sustainable Urban Transport Project. The other will be in \none of the towns covered by the ongoing ADB\u2013TDF projects. Learning by doing, TDF staff will \nformulate and design these two study cases up to the point when a request for qualifications \nhas been issued and a shortlist of bidders established. The later stages of the demonstration \nprojects, such as the requests for proposals, may be undertaken by ADB\u2019s Capital Markets and \nInfrastructure Finance Support Project.6 \n                                                \n4  The TDF is targeting the following sectors for financing: (i) drainage and sewerage; (ii) water supply; (iii) solid \nwaste management; (iv) road and transport, including public transport; (v) tourism and city beautification; (vi) land \nand housing; (vii) electrification and renewable energy; (viii) public buildings; and (ix) commercial markets.  \n5  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan, Grant, and   \nAdministration of Grant to Nepal for the Kathmandu Sustainable Urban Transport Project. Manila (Loan 2656 and \nGrant 0212-NEP, for $ 20 million, approved on 22 July). \n6  The Capital Markets and Infrastructure Finance Support Project (P43490-NEP) is currently under preparation. \n ", "4   \n16.  Coordination. To complement their efforts and avoid duplication, coordination between \ndevelopment partners involved in PPP development in Nepal is crucial. ADB\u2019s TA will build on \nother support for the TDF from GTZ and the World Bank (para. 9). In addition, the UNDP is \nsupporting the drafting of a white paper on PPP through its PPP for the Urban Environment \nProgram. This forthcoming white paper is to be approved by the National Planning Commission \nand will also be reviewed by ADB. The document will pave the way for a much-needed national \npolicy and guidelines on PPP but formulation and approval is expected to take time under \nprevailing political and institutional circumstances. Given this constraint, the development of \nTDF sector policies under the TA for social and municipal infrastructure financing will provide an \nimportant bottom\u2013up input for an eventual national policy. Coordination among development \npartners and with relevant government agencies will be enhanced through a steering committee \n(para. 19). \n \n17.  Coordination within ADB will also be important. The TA will be part of the comprehensive \nsupport by ADB to promote PPP approaches at the local level. It also complements ADB \ncapacity development TA for institutional strengthening of municipalities, capacity building for \nwaste management, and support for local governance and community development.7 It also \nadds on ADB\u2019s effort to promote private sector participation in infrastructure financing at the \nnational level in power and road sectors.8 The TA is also closely linked through its objectives to \nADB\u2019s Capital Markets and Infrastructure Finance Support Project which will focus on building \ncapacities for PPP at the central government level and for the proposed Nepal Infrastructure \nBank (footnote 7). This new project may participate in the preparation of the demonstration \nprojects under the TA (para. 15). Synergy will also be developed between the TA and the \nactivities of ADB Regional and Sustainable Development Department, such as the Asia PPP \nNetwork and the Asia PPP Source Book.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  It is estimated that the TA will cost the equivalent of $300,000. The government has \nrequested that ADB finance the equivalent of $250,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will finance the \nbalance of the cost, equivalent to $50,000, through the provision of office space, remuneration \nfor counterpart staff, and other in-kind contributions (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The client and executing agency will be MPPW. The TDF, under the MPPW, will be the \nimplementing agency and will (i) set up a project management unit to be agreed upon by ADB, \nand (ii) appoint a project director internally who will take the lead in coordinating and monitoring \nall activities performed by the consultants and relevant organizations. \n \n20.  A steering committee will be designated by the MPPW and established at the central \ngovernment level to monitor TA implementation. The steering committee will be chaired by the \nsecretary of the MPPW and consist of representatives from the National Planning Commission, \nthe Ministry of Finance, the MPPW, the Ministry of Local Development, the Department of \nUrban Development and Building Construction, the Department of Water Supply and Sewerage, \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2009.

The project director will work as the member \nsecretary of the steering committee. The steering committee will meet at least once every 2 \nmonths, and more frequently if needed, to review the consultant\u2019s findings, discuss the overall \nprogress  of  the  TA,  strengthen  coordination,  and  provide  policy  guidance  on  final \nrecommendations. ADB will undertake the TA review in collaboration with the MPPW at least \ntwice during implementation. \n \n21.  The government will provide (i) project consultants\u2019 offices for around five persons at the \nTDF building for the duration of the assignment, with basic furniture, external connections for \ntelephone and internet, and costs for utilities such as electricity and water; (ii) a TA director from \nthe MPPW, assigned before the mobilization of consultants; (iii) qualified counterpart staff and \nadequate  supervisory  officers  designated  by  the  TDF  to  guide,  oversee,  and  monitor  all \nactivities and findings of the consultants; (iv) all the data available and necessary to undertake \nthe study properly, including existing studies, statistics, and maps, if needed; (v) administrative \nsupport;  and  (vi)  facilities  and  support  to  organize  and  conduct  the  mid-study  and  final \nworkshop. \n \n22.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months from May to November 2011. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants is in Appendix 3. International expertise (7 person-months) \nwill be obtained in the area of financial intermediaries and PPP policy, legal and regulatory \nframework  for  PPP,  and  municipal  infrastructure  finance.  National  consultants  (12  person-\nmonths) will have expertise in the fields of municipal infrastructure finance, legal and regulatory \nframework for PPP, and environmental and social safeguards policy. The consultants will be \nengaged  by  ADB  in  accordance  with  its  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). The international team leader will be recruited as an individual \nconsultant because of his or her key role in the TA and the need to have more control over \nconsultant selection (including faster processing time for recruitment). Working under the leader, \na team of consultants will be recruited under one package using the quality- and cost-based \nmethod of selection with a standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. A biodata technical proposal will \nbe used for the selection of the consultant firm. Procurement of equipment will be done in \naccordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n23.  The consultants will help the government organize workshops at the beginning and near \nthe end of the TA. In the initial workshop, the TA framework, approach, objectives, and targets \nwill be shared with participants from government agencies, development partners, the private \nsector, and nongovernment organizations. Seminars and consultation workshops will be held as \nneeded during implementation of the TA to solicit the views of stakeholders in drafting policies, \nstrategies, regulations, guidelines, and standards. The final workshop will review good practices \nand  lessons  learned  during  the  implementation  of  the  TA.  The  consultants  will  ensure \ncoordination with the related ADB projects and TA and with the programs of other development \npartners (paras. 16 and 17). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.
