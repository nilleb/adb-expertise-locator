THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nGeorgia for the East\u2013West Highway (Shorapani\u2013Argveta Section) Improvement Project. \n \n2.  The proposed project will finance the construction of about 14.7 kilometers (km) of an \naccess-controlled,  dual  two-lane  carriageway,  partly  on  new  alignment,  on  the  East\u2013West \nHighway (EWH) between Shorapani and Argveta, which is part of Corridor 2 of the Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program. The project will also include (i) improving \nabout 15 km of secondary roads connecting to the section, (ii) increasing road safety through road \nsafety works and a road safety awareness campaign, (iii) implementing overload control, and (iv) \npursuing  the  performance-based  maintenance  (PBM)  contracting  initiative.  The  project  will \nexpand the efforts of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other development partners in this \ncritical economic corridor, and will enhance inclusive economic growth and regional connectivity. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strategic location. Georgia is located at the crossroads of transit routes linking Europe \nand Asia. In accordance with its 2020 socioeconomic development strategy,1 the government is \ncommitted to develop the country as a regional transport and logistics hub for trade between \nEurope and Central Asia and even East Asia. Georgia\u2019s main trade partners include Turkey (trade \nturnover of $1.629 billion), the Russian Federation ($1.190 billion), and the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina ($966 million).2 \n \n4.  Regional connectivity. The government is investing substantially in infrastructure to take \nadvantage of its location and tourism attractions, emphasizing the country\u2019s backbone for transit \ntrade: the East\u2013West and North\u2013South transport corridors. Forming part of the CAREC Program\u2019s \nCorridor 2, the EWH stretches more than 410 km from Sarpi on the Black Sea, at the border with \nTurkey, through the center of the country to the capital of Tbilisi, and on to the border with \nAzerbaijan. This link is of particular significance in the region for landlocked countries. The EWH \nrepresents about 2% of Georgia\u2019s road network length and 30% of its international road network; \nit carries more than 60% of the country\u2019s foreign trade and serves a daily average of more than \n13,300 vehicles. Its average annual traffic growth from 2009 to 2018 was 7%, nearly double the \naverage gross domestic product growth during the same period (3.9%). It is being upgraded with \nassistance from ADB, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the European Investment Bank \n(EIB), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the World Bank. \n \n5.  Road sector policy context. The government\u2019s transport investments have focused on \nroad transport, with rail and ports financed largely by the private sector. The Ministry of Regional \nDevelopment and Infrastructure (MRDI) developed an action plan for 2018\u20132021, which budgeted \nGEL10,231 million for infrastructure development, of which about GEL7,324 million was allocated \nfor road improvement (72%).3 The government has targeted its financing and priority interventions \non the EWH, the North\u2013South Corridor, and critical sections of the secondary road network.4 \n \n \n1  Government of Georgia. 2014.

Tbilisi. \n4  Government of Georgia, MRDI, Roads Department. 2018. 2017 Annual Report. Tbilisi. \n ", "2 \n6.  Sector performance. The 22,000 km road network has about 1,520 km of international \nroads and 5,370 km of secondary roads managed by the Roads Department under the MRDI, as \nwell as 15,000 km of local roads managed by district administrations. While 8% of international \nroads are in good or fair condition, about 40% of secondary roads and 60% of local roads are in \npoor condition. Traveling through and within Georgia can be time-consuming, uncomfortable, and \nexpensive\u2014disproportionately affecting women\u2019s access to jobs, markets, and public services. \n \n7.  Road  maintenance  expenditure,  including  rehabilitation  and  periodic  and  routine \nmaintenance, has increased to an average of $26,700 per km, which compares favorably with \nother countries in the region.5 The government has made continued efforts to improve road \nmaintenance  planning,  budgeting,  and  efficiency  by  developing  a  road  asset  management \nsystem, pilot testing PBM contracts, and assessing tolling options. The road asset management \nsystem is being fed into a 5-year rolling planning and programming process. \n \n8.  Performance-based maintenance. The Roads Department contracts all its construction \nand maintenance activities to the private sector through open competitive bidding. Most road \nmaintenance is carried out through traditional input-based contracts. One PBM contract is under \nimplementation (Kakheti region) and two PBM contracts are being prepared under ADB and \nWorld Bank financing. The Roads Department intends to expand the PBM approach to other \nregions and apply it countrywide after conducting an experience analysis that will consider each \nregion\u2019s particularities. A fourth PBM contract will be implemented under the proposed project. \n \n9.  Overload monitoring and control. Another complementary measure to ensure the \nlongevity of the road network is axle load monitoring and control. Overloaded vehicles create \nsignificant road damage, accelerating road deterioration. This is particularly relevant for PBM \ncontract management, as it affects the amount of investment needed to maintain the required \nperformance level. A program providing portable scales for overload control and a pilot project \nconsisting of the installation of a weigh-in-motion site on the EWH with corresponding adjacent \nweigh bridges, will be implemented under the proposed project.6 \n \n10.  Other initiatives. The East\u2013West Highway (Khevi\u2013Ubisa Section) Improvement Project \napproved  by  ADB  on  27  September  2018  addresses this  challenge  by  supporting  a  road \nmaintenance sustainability strategy for all highways in Georgia and providing project management \ntraining.7 The government recently sought assistance from development partners to implement  \ne-tolling (para. 35). \n \n11.  Road safety. Road safety has been improving overall, and some promising developments \nhave taken place. The road traffic fatality rate declined from 15.4 deaths per 100,000 people in \n2010  to  12.3  deaths  per  100,000  people  in  2018,8  but  remains  higher  than  the  rate  in \nEuropean   countries  such  as  Sweden  (2.8)  and  the  United  Kingdom  (3.1).  In  2015,  the \ngovernment  enacted  the  revised  Law  on  Road  Traffic,  which  included  road  safety-related \namendments. It also approved a National Road Safety Strategy in 2016 and subsequently \nestablished an interagency Road Safety Commission.9 Road safety investment planning and \nperformance tracking systems are being developed following the approaches and methodologies \nof the International Road Assessment Programme. Systematic road safety audits and public \n \n5  Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n6  Weigh-in-motion devices are designed to capture and record axle weights and gross vehicle weights as vehicles \ndrive over a measurement site. \n7  ADB.

Need for the road. At the end of April 2019, more than 45% of the EWH was completed, \nwith about 190 km upgraded and 140 km under construction or about to be mobilized. One \nimportant  missing  link  is  the  59  km  segment  from  Chumateleti  to  Argveta,  which  covers \nsubsections F1\u2013F4 (para. 13). The segment passes through mountainous terrain, ravines, and \nnumerous river crossings. The feasibility study prepared under World Bank financing in 2015 \nconsidered this part of the corridor a bottleneck in the EWH.10 Improvements are either completed \nor underway on each side of this segment. The existing two-lane road is a winding road where \ncars, buses, and trucks need to reduce their speed. Heavy transit traffic going through small towns \nand villages also poses environmental and safety problems for the local population and tourists \nusing the road. The completed EWH will be an essential national and regional link. Moreover, a \nWorld Bank study demonstrated wide ranging impacts, including that reduced transportation costs \nafter corridor improvements benefit the rural population to a greater extent as it is more reliant on \ntransportation and sensitive to price changes than urban population.11  \n \n13.  Development support. Major development partners have committed to financing this part \nof the EWH. The project\u2019s feasibility study broke up this segment of the EWH into five subsections: \nF0, F1, F2, F3, and F4. The World Bank and the EIB are financing F0 and F1. Construction on \nF0 is ongoing and the civil works contract for F1 was awarded in July 2019. Additional financing \nfor tranche 3 of the ADB-financed Road Corridor Investment Program financed the detailed \ndesigns for F2 (Khevi\u2013Ubisa), F3 (Ubisa\u2013Shorapani), and F4 (Shorapani\u2013Argveta).12 Civil works \nfor F2, financed under the East\u2013West Highway (Khevi\u2013Ubisa Section) Improvement Project \n(footnote 7), are ongoing. Civil works are also ongoing for F3, which is financed by the EIB through \na loan approved on 3 September 2018.13 JICA financing was anticipated for F4 , but this approach \nwas discontinued and the loan was cancelled on 19 April 2019. F4 is the last remaining bottleneck \nof the segment. \n \n14.  Strategic fit. The project is aligned with the regional cooperation and integration strategic \npriority of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 (para. 4),14 and operational cluster 3 (infrastructure and economic \nconnectivity) of CAREC 2030.15 Improving the project road is a government priority, as reflected \nby the government\u2019s investment in F0\u2013F3 and request for assistance for F4 dated 22 May 2019. \nThe project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2019\u20132023 for Georgia, which \naims to develop economic corridors for private sector development to create more jobs, combat \npoverty, and facilitate interregional trade.16 \n \n15.  Lessons. Since 2009, ADB has financed preparatory studies and five road projects\u2014four \nstand-alone projects and one multitranche financing facility\u2014totaling $1.17 billion. Lessons from \nthese  projects  include  the  need  to  (i)  complete  the  detailed  design  and  initiate  advance \n \n10 Government of Georgia, MRDI. 2015.

Not only have these lessons been \nincorporated into the project design, which creates synergy with other ADB-assisted interventions, \nbut projects for future engagement are already benefiting  as project preparation  (including \nsafeguard documents and detailed design) under ADB loans is now standard practice in Georgia. \nContinuous support and dialogue with the government and development partners active in the \nsector will help ensure sound project operation and management upon its completion. \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n16.  The project is aligned with the following  impacts: (i) economic growth and regional \nconnectivity supported (footnote 1), and (ii) infrastructure and economic connectivity cluster \nimproved (footnote 15). The project will have the following outcome: efficiency and safety of road \ntransport along the EWH improved.20 \n \n17.  Output 1: Shorapani and Argveta section constructed. This output will involve (i) the \nconstruction of 14.7 km of an access-controlled dual two-lane carriageway or a four-lane divided \nhighway to a 100-kilometer-per-hour (km/h) design standard, partly on new alignment; and (ii) the \nimprovement of about 15 km of secondary roads connecting to the EWH. It will include the \nconstruction of a rest stop with separate toilet facilities for women and men; features that make it \naccessible to the elderly, children, and people with disabilities; and commercial stalls, of which \n50% will be allocated for women. \n \n18.  Output 2: Road safety increased. This output will include (i) the execution of road safety \nworks on the EWH; and (ii) the development and implementation of a gender-sensitive road safety \nawareness campaign for roadside villages and schools, with women comprising at least 50% of \nparticipants, and training for female community mobilizers. \n \n19.  Output 3: Overload control implemented. This output will comprise (i) the procurement \nof 38 portable scales to be deployed in six priority municipalities, and (ii) a pilot project that will \ninstall at least one weigh-in-motion site on the EWH with corresponding adjacent weigh bridges. \n \n20.  Output 4: Performance-based maintenance contract implemented. The PBM contract \nwill cover about 150 km of international and connecting secondary roads. It has output- and \nperformance-based components and consist of (i) initial rehabilitation or repairs; (ii) routine \nmaintenance, which will comprise lump-sum monthly payments for every kilometer meeting the \ndefined operation and maintenance service levels; (iii) periodic maintenance (resurfacing); and \n(iv) emergency maintenance works. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n21.   ADB has become the government\u2019s lead development partner in the transport sector. \nWith this project, ADB\u2019s support for the sector will reach $1 billion over a 2-year period. Given \nADB\u2019s involvement in this part of the EWH (para. 13), ADB is in a unique position to provide rapid \n \n17 Accomplished for the East\u2013West Highway (Khevi\u2013Ubisa Section) Improvement Project (footnote 7) and ADB. \nGeorgia: North\u2013South Corridor (Kvesheti\u2013Kobi) Road Project. \n18 Independent Evaluation Department. 2019.

Without this project, the anticipated benefits of the other approved sections \nsupported by ADB, the EIB, and the World Bank will be negatively impacted. Through the project, \nADB will help the government (i) ensure that adequate climate change adaptation, gender-\nsensitive, and road safety features are incorporated into the engineering design; (ii) pursue the \nPBM contracting initiative; and (iii) expand the regional spillover and economic benefits supported \nby other ADB-assisted projects in Georgia and Armenia. At the sector level, ADB is supporting \nthe government in developing a road maintenance strategy.21 ADB\u2019s leading role in the CAREC \nProgram will provide the government with tools and opportunities for information sharing and \nlearning exchange on road safety and asset management. \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n22.  The project is estimated to cost \u20ac337.1 million (Table 1). The Roads Department and the \ndesign consultant prepared the project\u2019s cost estimates in April 2019 based on the detailed \nengineering design. These were adjusted in May 2019 based on the contract prices for the latest \nawarded contract supervision consultants for ADB-financed projects.22 Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are included in the project administration manual (PAM).23 \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n(\u20ac million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The  MRDI  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  its  Roads  Department  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The Eurasian Transport Corridor Investment Center (ETCIC),26 also under \nthe MRDI, will assist the Roads Department with project financial management activities. \n \n27.  Procurement of all contracts will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended \nfrom time to time) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time \nto time). The project\u2019s procurement readiness is high given that the main civil works contract and \nthe construction supervision consultant contract are being procured through advance contracting. \nThe government has been advised that advance contracting and retroactive financing do not \ncommit ADB to finance the project. The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 3 \nand described in detail in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2019\u2013June 2025 \nEstimated completion date  30 June 2025 \nEstimated loan closing date  31 December 2025 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Ministry of Finance, Deputy Minister (chair) \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure \n(iii) Implementing agency  Roads Department \nProcurement  Civil works (OCB)  4 contracts  $305.71 million \nGoods (OCB)  1 contract  $0.49 million \nConsulting services  Construction supervision (QCBS)  1 contract  $8.93 million \nIndividual consultant selection (competitive)  6 contracts  $0.35 million \nFinancial audit (LCS)  1 contract  $0.05 million \nRetroactive financing and  Retroactive financing of up to 20% of the loan amount will be allowed for \nadvance contracting  civil works and consulting services incurred before loan effectiveness but \nnot earlier than 12 months before loan signing.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n28.  Road design. The project road is an access-controlled dual carriageway or a four-lane \ninternational road with a total width of 27.60 meters (m), comprising traffic lanes (4 x 3.75 m), \npaved shoulders (5.00 m), median (5.00 m), and unpaved shoulders (2.60 m). The median width \nvaries depending on the terrain. The design speed is 100 km/h, which is reduced to 80 km/h in \nmountainous sections. The road design follows the Standard on Geometrical and Structural \nRequirements for the Public Motor Roads of Georgia with reference to relevant clauses of the \nTrans-European Motorway standards. Only short sections will follow the existing alignment \nbecause of the terrain and the design standard adopted. Frontage roads, four interchanges, and \naccess roads to these interchanges will maintain local traffic along the project highway. The \nterrain requires the construction of 14 bridges with a total length of 5.0 km and 12 tunnels with a \ntotal length of 8.5 km (for both directions cumulatively), making the project technically highly \ncomplex.  \n \n29.  Road safety. The road design meets internationally accepted standards and practices in \nterms of road safety; the design review team included an international road safety specialist for \nthis purpose. The tunnels have been designed to reflect the provisions of the European Union \nDirective 2004/54/EC on minimum safety requirements for tunnels in the Trans-European Road \nNetwork. The design will be subjected to detailed road safety audits before construction, during \nconstruction, and before final acceptance of the completed road, in close coordination with the \ntraffic police and relevant government agencies. \n \n30.  Technical due diligence confirmed that the technical design, alignment, cross-section, \nbridges, tunnels, drainage structures, pavements, and climate and road safety provisions are \nappropriate for a road of this standard in this location and for the projected traffic volume. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n31.  The economic evaluation of the project was undertaken using the highway development \nand management model, following relevant ADB guidelines.27 For the economic analysis, the \nwith-project scenario assumed a new four-lane road will be provided, safety features will be \nimproved, and tunnels and bridges will be constructed to modern standards. Without the project, \nthe EWH is expected to require significant periodic maintenance. Future traffic was estimated \nbased on classified traffic counts conducted in 2017 and available gross domestic product growth \nforecasts (footnote 5). \n  \n32.  The project is economically viable, with an estimated economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) of 11.3% and a net present value of $65.1 million at a 9% discount rate. The principal \nquantifiable benefits are reduced vehicle operating costs and reduced travel time. Sensitivity tests \n \n27 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "8 \nconfirmed that the project\u2019s economic viability is robust against cost increases of up to 30% and \nbenefit decreases of up to 77%. The project\u2019s EIRR is 9.6% if crash cost savings are excluded \nand values of time are not increased in real terms. However, the EIRR does not capture larger \nregional beneficial impacts, particularly for neighboring landlocked countries. \n \n33.  The project is nonrevenue generating, and the project road will be maintained under the \ngovernment\u2019s maintenance program. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n34.  Assessments of the MRDI\u2019s road asset management practices and capabilities during \nprevious project preparation activities showed that steady increases in road sector funding since \n2004 led to major backlog recovery. Annual expenditure for road maintenance and rehabilitation \nnearly doubled from GEL218 million in 2014 to GEL407 million in 2018. During 2014\u20132018, the \ncompound annual growth rate of road maintenance and rehabilitation expenditure was 13.3%, \nwhile the average annual inflation rate was 3.6%. Over the same period, the compound annual \ngrowth rate of road-related revenues was 15.1%, which was 1.2%\u20132.1% of gross domestic \nproduct. The annual average incremental maintenance costs associated with the project are \nestimated to be in line with current expenditure ($26,700 per km) and equivalent to about 0.2% of \nthe overall road maintenance and rehabilitation expenditure in 2018. \n \n35.  Recognizing  the  need  to  expand  its  revenue  base  to  cater  for  future  needs,  the \ngovernment has sought assistance from development partners to assess the potential and \nsuitability of road tolling. Two studies supported by the World Bank and the European Bank for \nReconstruction and Development have recommended tolling as a viable revenue source. The \ngovernment is recruiting consultants to conduct further feasibility studies on priority highway \nsections. The financial analysis concluded that the MRDI has sufficient financial capacity, within \ngovernment budgetary procedures, to meet recurrent expenditures to operate and maintain the \nproject road adequately. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n36.  Financial management. The financial management assessment (FMA) followed relevant \nADB guidelines. Although the Roads Department is the implementing agency for the project, the \nETCIC will assist with project financial management activities and have full primary responsibility \nfor  disbursements  and  their  related  accounting  and  control.  As  such,  the  FMA  primarily \nconsidered the ETCIC\u2019s financial management capacity with regard to funds flow arrangements, \nstaffing, accounting and financial reporting systems, financial information systems, and internal \nand external auditing arrangements. The assessed pre-mitigation financial management risk\u2014\nboth inherent risk and control risk\u2014is moderate mainly because of (i) the growing portfolio of \nexternally funded projects that may lead to insufficient staffing within the ETCIC; and (ii) lack of \nvariance analysis between budgeted and actual expenditure that may lead to inadequate financial \nreporting. The FMA concluded that subject to addressing the above points, the ETCIC has \nsufficient and appropriate financial management capacity to support project implementation. The \nMRDI, the Roads Department, and the ETCIC will maintain adequate and separate project \nrecords and accounts, which an independent auditor will audit annually. \n \n37.  Procurement. The project procurement risk assessment, undertaken following relevant \nADB guidelines, considered the Roads Department\u2019s capacity with regard to organization and \nstaffing, information management, procurement practices, complaints and dispute resolution \nmechanisms, and accountability measures. The assessed procurement risk is moderate because \n ", "9 \nof (i) the growing portfolio of externally funded projects that may lead to insufficient staffing within \nthe Roads Department, and (ii) record management systems and procedures that need further \nimprovement. The project procurement risk assessment concluded that, subject to addressing the \nabove points, the Roads Department has sufficient and appropriate procurement capacity to \nimplement  the  project.  The  project  procurement  arrangements  chosen  for  the  civil  works \ncomponent are based on experience gained through the contracts awarded for the other EWH \nsections (F0, F1, F2, and F3) and the market insight they provided. The best value for money \nwould be achieved by designing one works package to be procured through open competitive \nbidding using the one-stage, one-envelope system\u2014to be awarded to the lowest evaluated \nsubstantially responsive bidder.  \n \n38.  Institutional capacity. The MRDI and the Roads Department adequately understand \nADB\u2019s procurement and financial management policy and procedures as a result of the sizable \nportfolio of ADB-assisted transport operations. Weaknesses on land acquisition and resettlement \nare being addressed through regional technical assistance, which includes on-the-job training of \nthe  Roads  Department  staff  and  implementation  of  grievance  management  tools.29  An \nexperienced consultant has been assigned to work with the Roads Department on a continuous \nbasis to help improve compliance with ADB\u2019s social safeguards requirements. \n \n39.  Anticorruption. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained \nto and discussed with the government, the MRDI, and the Roads Department. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 23). \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n40.  The project will support poverty reduction by facilitating increased and safe movement of \npeople and goods, as well as access to economic opportunities and social services. The project \nwill benefit the residents of the villages by providing (i) skills building programs that will enhance \nthe marketability of products developed in the area, and (ii) spaces to sell these and produce from \ntheir farms. The project is categorized general intervention with no specific direct intervention on \npoverty reduction. It will ensure compliance with core labor standards, with a preference for local \nlabor, and will prohibit child labor among contractors. The project will take measures to cushion \nthe negative impacts of land acquisition in the affected communities. \n \n41.  The project is categorized effective gender mainstreaming. It will include gender- and \nsocially inclusive features that will facilitate the safe access and mobility of travelers and residents \nfrom nearby villages. These include (i) an all-weather rest stop at the interchange nearest \nZestafoni that will have (a) separate toilets for men and women; and (b) commercial spaces for \nselling agricultural produce and agricultural products (e.g., cheese), 50% of which will be reserved \nfor female entrepreneurs; (ii) skills training on product development, packaging, and marketing \nfor processed agricultural products, with women comprising 50% of participants; (iii) capacity \nbuilding for women as community mobilizers for road safety awareness; and (iv) road safety \nawareness-raising programs for communities, with women making up at least 50% of participants. \n \n42.  The Roads Department will engage a gender specialist to ensure the quality and timely \nimplementation of the gender action plan.31 Aside from supporting the implementation of the \ngender action plans of road projects, the Roads Department is taking steps to promote gender \nequity in its organization. It established in 2019 a gender focal point. The Roads Department will \n \n29 ADB. 2018. Technical Assistance for Supporting Social Safeguards in the Central and West Asia Region.

Safeguards \n \n43.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.32  \n \n44.  Environment (category A). The draft environmental impact assessment was disclosed \non 28 May 2019.33 This draft was submitted by the Roads Department and reviewed by ADB and \nall key elements required for disclosure were present, including the use of International Finance \nCorporation standards for noise modeling in line with the Safeguard Policy Statement. The project \nwill have significant adverse impacts that are irreversible and diverse. The alignment will be \npartially new and will require significant tunneling and bridge-building activities with significant \ncommunity impacts from resettlement and land conversion. Works will require the construction of \n10 bridges in the Borimela, Dzirula, and Kvirila rivers, resulting in the loss of riparian habitat.34 \nTunneling  and  cutting  will  require  the  disposal  of  700,000  cubic  meters  of  spoil  during \nconstruction.35 Impacts  on  noise, vibration,  air  quality,  and  surface  water  will  occur  during \nconstruction. The short-term nature of impacts means they will generally not be significant if \nmitigation is implemented correctly, although cumulative impacts from traffic because of the \nsimultaneous construction of the F1\u2013F4 subsections will need to be well managed. During \noperations, the road will significantly improve local road safety by removing through traffic from \nlocal roads. However, the road will result in the permanent loss of 28 hectares of natural habitat, \nwhich will require reinstatement and off-site habitat compensation to meet ADB\u2019s safeguard policy \nrequirements. In addition, noise impacts from the new alignment will be significant, requiring \ntargeted mitigation and potential resettlement for 24 properties to ensure the project remains in \ncompliance  during  operation.  The  Roads  Department  has  the  expertise  to  manage  the \ncontractors\u2019 environmental performance adequately. \n \n45.  Involuntary  resettlement  (category  A).  According  to  the  preliminary  inventory, \ninvoluntary resettlement affects 455 households (2,047 persons) of which 426 are severely \naffected households, including 21 that are physically displaced. A LARP prepared for JICA is \nunder implementation and more than 85% completed. Due diligence is being performed on the \nLARP. A corrective action plan prepared to cover gaps between JICA and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement consists primarily of (i) an upward revision of severely affected households under the \nLARP, with a consequent upward revision in the budget for allowances; and (ii) minor upward \nrevisions in the allowances to reflect recent revisions to road sector LARPs in Georgia.36  \n \n46.  Indigenous peoples (category C). No indigenous peoples are present in the project \narea, as defined in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \n47.  The construction supervision consultant\u2019s resettlement and environmental specialists will \nassist the Roads Department to ensure compliance with the project\u2019s safeguard requirements and \nprepare semiannual safeguards monitoring reports for ADB\u2019s review and disclosure. The Roads \nDepartment will also engage qualified and experienced external monitors to verify environmental \nand resettlement impacts. \n \n32 ADB.
