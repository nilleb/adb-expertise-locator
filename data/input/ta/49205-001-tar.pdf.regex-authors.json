INTRODUCTION \n1.  A series of loan and technical assistance (TA) projects are being prepared to support \ncoordinated  development  in  the  Beijing,  Tianjin,  and  Hebei  (BTH)  region  with  a  focus  on \nsustainable and inclusive growth. Immediate support includes four TAs and one sovereign loan \nin  the  areas  of  air  pollution,  balanced  economic  and  social  development,  and  low  carbon \ntransport.1 \n \n2.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested a TA from the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Regional Air Pollution Control. ADB \nfielded a consultation mission on 30 March 2015 to clarify and agree with the Office of the \nBeijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  and  Surrounding  Regions  Air  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control \nCoordination Group on the TA\u2019s scope, impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, \ncost,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  of  consultants. 2 The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The government confirmed the TA during the 2015 \ncountry programming midterm review on 3 June 2015 and ADB Management approved the TA \nconcept paper on 24 August 2015.3  \n \n3.   The TA will (i) develop a road map for BTH regional air pollution prevention and control \nin the medium to long term, (ii) conduct a study on mechanisms and measures for joint air \npollution prevention and control in the key cities of BTH, and (iii) build the capacity of the local \nenvironmental protection agencies on air quality management. The TA will help improve the air \nquality in BTH, which is a national public priority.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  BTH is among the most polluted regions in the PRC.4 According to a report released by \nthe Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), eight of the top 10 cities in the PRC with the \nworst ambient air quality in 2014 were in BTH. In that same year, 13 BTH cities had an average \n156 days that met the national air quality standard; in contrast, the average for 74 major cities \nacross the PRC was 241 days. The table below compares BTH to two other population and \neconomic centers of the PRC, i.e., Yangtze River Delta region and Zhu River Delta region, in \nterms of major air pollutants. BTH is significantly inferior across different pollutants.  \n \nAnnual Average Concentrations of Major Pollutants in 2014 (mg/m3) \nPollutants  BTH (13 cities)  Yangtze River Delta (25 cities)  Zhu River Delta (9 cities) \nPM a  93.0  60.0  42.0 \n2.5\nPM   158.0  92.0  61.0 \n10\nSO   52.0  25.0  18.0 \n2\n                                                \n1  The four technical assistance projects are: (i) Study on the Coordinated Development of Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei; (ii) \nStudy on Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Air Pollution Control; (iii) Policy Study on the Development of Intercity Railway in \nthe Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei; and (iv) Study on Handan Low Carbon Emission Transport Project. The sovereign loan \nis the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Air Quality Improvement Policy-Based Lending Project. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 August 2015. \n3  The proposed TA was not included in the latest country operations business plan of the PRC. During the country \nprogramming midterm review on 3 June 2015, the Government of the PRC and ADB\u2019s East Asia Department both \nagreed to process and implement the TA as soon as possible given the significance and urgency of the problem \nthe project aims to address. \n4   BTH refers to seven province-level districts in the northern PRC: Beijing and Tianjin municipalities; Hebei, Henan, \nShandong, and Shanxi provinces; and the Inner Mongolia autonomous region.  \n ", "2   \nPollutants  BTH (13 cities)  Yangtze River Delta (25 cities)  Zhu River Delta (9 cities) \nNO   49.0  39.0  37.0 \n2\nCO  3.5  1.5  1.5 \nO   162.0  154.0  156.0 \n3\nBTH = Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei and surrounding regions, CO = carbon monoxide, mg = milligram, m3 = cubic meter, \nNO  = nitrogen dioxide, O = ozone, PM = particulate matter, SO  = sulfur dioxide.  \n2 3  2\na  PM is a particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. The PRC standard is 35 \n2.5 \nmg/m3. The World Health Organization standard is 10 mg/m3, with the first interim target at 35 mg/m3, second \ninterim target at 25 mg/m3, and third interim target at 15 mg/m3.  \nSource: Ministry of Environmental Protection, People\u2019s Republic of China. \n \n5.  The severe air pollution in BTH poses a significant public health concern. According to \nthe latest census data, in 2010, 104 million or 7.79% of the total population of the PRC reside in \nBTH. Population density reached 484 persons per square kilometer, four times the national \naverage. The figures have been increasing since. It was reported that the lung cancer incidence \nin Beijing increased by 43% from 1998 to 2007.5 While multiple factors could have contributed to \nthis increase, air pollution is considered to be a major factor.  \n \n6.  The deteriorating air quality in BTH has drawn considerable attention from the public, \npolicy makers, and even the international community. The State Council issued the Ambient Air \nPollution Prevention and Control Action Plan in September 2013 to set unprecedented air \nquality improvement targets for BTH by 2017. In particular, ambient PM concentrations, one of \n2.5 \nthe most harmful air pollutants, need to be reduced by 25% in BTH, by 20% in Shanxi and \nShandong provinces, and by 10% in Inner Mongolia vis-\u00e0-vis the 2012 concentration levels.6  \n \n7.  Improvement of the air quality in BTH becomes more significant if viewed in the context \nof  the  BTH  regional  development  synchronization,  which  has  been  adopted  as  a  national \nstrategy to promote balanced growth across the region. Regionally coordinated air pollution \nprevention and control is both a contributor to as well as a result of the regional development \nsynchronization. Thus, in 2013, the PRC established the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei and Surrounding \nRegions Air Pollution Prevention and Control Coordination Group to guide, coordinate, and \nsupervise air pollution control in BTH. The group is supervised by a vice-premier and joined by \nthe  key  central  government  agencies,  including  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  the  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission, and MEP, as well as the seven provincial governments. \nUnder the coordination group, an office manages daily work led by the vice mayor of Beijing \nMunicipality and the vice minister of MEP. \n \n8.  Improving air quality in the BTH is a long-term challenge. First, BTH encompasses a \nlarge area with diverse sources of pollutants. Some of the identified major sources of pollutants \ninclude automobiles in Beijing, fuel-intensive industries in Tianjin and Hebei, shipping emissions \nfrom Tianjin harbor, and coal burning (for power generation and residential use) in Hebei. The \npollutants can travel across the region given certain climatic conditions, making pollution control \na complex task. Second, the region observes substantial disparities in economic and social \ndevelopment. For instance, in 2013, Beijing and Tianjin had per capita gross domestic product \n(GDP) above $16,000, while Hebei and Shanxi\u2019s per capita GDP were just about $6,000. Within \nHebei, the per capita GDP varies between $3,762 (Xingtai City) and $13,148 (Tangshan City). \nConsequently,  the  economic  structure,  capacity  for  environmental  management,  emission \nstandards, and pollution prevention and control techniques differ greatly between areas within \nBTH. This calls for concerted actions by local governments in dealing with air pollution in the \n                                                \n5  People. People Health Channel. http://health.people.com.cn/n/2014/0414/c14739-24890405.html \n6  PM  is particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. It is one of the most harmful \n2.5\nair pollutants because of its ability to penetrate deep into the lungs. \n ", "  3 \nlong run. Mechanisms to encourage such coordination and collaboration have begun to emerge \nwith  the  establishment of  the  coordination group.  Preparation  of the master  plan for  BTH \nregional air pollution prevention and control also started in mid-2015. At this initial stage, the \ngovernment needs urgent technical support and capacity building to help establish an effective \nregional system for air pollution prevention and control.  \n \n9.  Due  to  their  higher  population  and  pollution  intensities,  Beijing,  Tianjin,  and  four \nneighboring cities in Hebei Province, i.e., Baoding, Cangzhou, Langfang, and Tangshan, are \ndesignated as the key areas within BTH in the 2015 Priorities for BTH Air Pollution Joint \nPrevention and Control approved by the coordination group. Reducing air pollution in these \nareas is considered more urgent as well as more effective in improving the air quality of the \nwhole BTH. In addition to developing the regional air quality management system, the TA will \nsupport an in-depth study focusing on these municipalities and cities as core areas and pilots of \nthe plan and mechanisms developed for BTH. \n \n10.  The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC, 2011\u20132015, which \nidentifies  environmentally  sustainable  growth  as  one  of  the  three  pillars  for  the  strategic \nframework.  ADB  will  support  government  efforts  to foster  a  cleaner  and  more  sustainable \ngrowth process by strengthening capacity in environmental management, helping to develop \nlivable and low-carbon cities, and promoting the development and institutionalization of green \nfinancing instruments. The TA will be a timely response to pressing air pollution issues in the \nnorthern PRC, and will directly support environmentally sustainable growth.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact will be the improved air quality in BTH.7 The outcome will be the promotion of \ncoordinated regional approach for air pollution prevention and control in BTH. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will produce the following outputs: \n(i)  Road map and policy recommendations. The TA will introduce international \nexperience on regional air quality management and conduct expert review and \nconsultations to support the preparation of the master plan for BTH regional air \npollution  prevention  and  control.  A  detailed  road  map  and  related  policy \nrecommendations will be developed to specify the paths and policies needed to \nput the master plan in practice. The report will cover unified emission standards, \nregional pre-warning and joint emergency response, and consistent emission \nmonitoring and coordinated reduction actions, among others, and will examine \nthe technical, institutional, economic, financing, and legal aspects for establishing \nthe regional mechanisms.  \n(ii)  Mechanisms and measures for joint air pollution prevention and control. \nThe in-depth study will focus on Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Province\u2019s Baoding, \nCangzhou, Langfang, and Tangshan cities. The study will survey the pollution \nstatus and existing control measures as well as the economic development of \nthese cities. It will then propose detailed cross-city cooperation mechanisms and \n                                                \n7  As aligned with Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, State Council. 2013. Air Pollution Prevention and \nControl Action Plan. Beijing.  \n ", "4   \npolicies applying the framework developed under the medium- to long-term road \nmap.  \n(iii)  Capacity building. To implement the regional cooperation mechanisms, the TA \nwill help harmonize the technical, monitoring, and management capacities of the \nlocal  environmental  protection  agencies  in  BTH.  Selected  local  environment \nbureaus  will  be  trained  and  will  attend  the  inception,  interim,  and  final  TA \nworkshops.  The  TA  will  explore  and  mobilize  additional  resources  from  line \nagencies such as the MEP and other international development partners for \nthese capacity\u2013building initiatives. \n \n13.  One potential risk is that effective regional air pollution prevention and control policies \nrecommended by the study may result in asymmetric costs and benefits across subregions, \nwhich may give rise to political opposition to the regional approach. Another risk is delays in the \ndevelopment  of  coordinated  mechanisms  across  boundaries  and  agencies  in  practice.  To \nmitigate both risks, policy makers should be well informed and consulted when developing \npolicies  and  mechanisms.  A  steering  committee  comprising  senior  officials  from  relevant \nagencies and municipalities will be formed to provide guidance and to help disseminate the TA \noutputs among the policy makers.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff time, access to administrative data, assistance to \nfield trips, use of office space and facilities, logistical support, and other in-kind contributions. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  Office  of  the  Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei  and  Surrounding  Regions  Air  Pollution \nPrevention and Control Coordination Group will be the executing agency. The secretariat of the \nexecuting agency, which is set up in the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection, \nwill  be  the  implementing  agency.  A  steering  committee  comprising  senior  officials  from \ncomprehensive and key line agencies and from involved municipalities will be formed to provide \ntechnical guidance and policy advice during TA implementation. A TA management office will be \nestablished  within  the  implementing  agency  and  will  be  responsible  for  (i)  day-to-day \nimplementation  and  management  of  the  TA,  such  as  overseeing  the  consultants\u2019  work, \norganizing domestic reviews of the TA outputs, and holding TA review workshops; (ii) liaising \nwith the steering committee for their participation in the TA events and guidance on the TA; and \n(iii) guiding and supervising the consultants to conduct the TA workshops and capacity\u2013building \nevents.  \n \n16.  The TA will engage one international consultant (4 person-months) as an individual \nconsultant, and a consulting firm consisting of five national consultants (20 person-months) with \nexpertise  in  environmental  planning,  environmental  policy,  environmental  engineering, \nenvironmental economics, and green financing, all with a focus on air pollution prevention and \ncontrol.8 The outline terms of reference of the consultants are provided in Appendix 3. The \n                                                \n8  Engaged as individual consultant, the international consultant is expected to start work a few months earlier than \nthe national consultants. Some outputs on the international experience can be prepared and incorporated directly \nin the master plan for BTH regional air pollution prevention and control, which is under preparation now and \nexpected to have the first draft in early 2016.  \n ", "  5 \nconsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). The consulting firm will be selected using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 and by applying the simplified \ntechnical  proposal  approach.  Resource  persons  may  be  invited  to  review  the  consultants\u2019 \noutputs, serving as an independent third party, and share knowledge during workshops and \ncapacity\u2013building events in complement to that of the consultants. The proceeds of the TA will \nbe disbursed in accordance with the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 15 months, tentatively from 15 October 2015 to 31 \nDecember 2016. ADB will field inception, interim, and final review missions in addition to regular \nmonitoring  of  TA  implementation.  During  the  missions,  tripartite  meetings  involving  the \nexecuting and implementing agencies and consultants will be held to review performance of the \nconsultants, implementation progress, and completion of deliverables based on the design and \nmonitoring framework and the consultants\u2019 work plan. The reports submitted by the consultants \nwill  be  reviewed  by  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies,  ADB,  and  external  peer \nreviewers. The final outputs will be disseminated to key policy makers and stakeholders through \nthe executing agency. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei Regional Air \nPollution Control, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with  \n \nAir quality in BTH improved (Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan)a \n \n \nPerformance Indicators \nwith Targets and  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Baselines  Reporting   Risks \nOutcome  By 2016:     \nCoordinated regional  a.
