THE PROPOSAL \n  \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on two proposed loans \nto Mongolia for the Sustainable Tourism Development Project. \n \n2.  The  project  will  help  transform  two  national  parks  in  Khuvsgul  and  Khentii  aimags \n(provinces) as models for economically inclusive tourism and conservation in the protected area \nnetwork, by improving park infrastructure, sanitation, and capacity to manage tourism growth \nsustainably.1 About 11,009 residents are expected to benefit from the project outputs, which are \ndesigned to achieve tourism-related income for communities, protection of natural capital, and \nclimate-resilient facilities; and which scale up from previous grant projects in each park. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT  \n \nA.  Rationale  \n \n3.  Tourism is the largest and fastest growing sector of the global economy. Ecotourism, a major \nsubsector,2 comprises up to 20% of global tourism and is a major contributor to rural income and \nthe financing of protected areas in many countries.3 Mongolia has a small but rapidly growing \ntourism sector. In 2017, tourism comprised 11.4% of Mongolia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP), \ngenerating $1.2 billion, 10.4% of total employment, and 121,500 jobs. By 2028, tourism is forecast \nto comprise 11.0% ($2.1 billion) of GDP and provide 149,000 jobs. International visitor arrivals \ntotaled 471,239 in 2017 and are forecast to increase to 1 million by 2028.4 Developing the tourism \nsector is a high national priority to diversify the economy and create jobs, especially under \nMongolia\u2019s current economic difficulties. The government\u2019s plans to expand tourism focus on \necotourism in protected areas, which encompass 21% of Mongolia\u2019s area and are targeted to reach \n30% by 2030.      \n  \n4.  Mongolia ranks low in the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (in 2017, Mongolia \nwas ranked 102 out of 136 countries evaluated). Challenges include low service standards, \ninadequate infrastructure, and a short tourism season due to harsh winters. Most protected areas \nare underfunded and located in remote regions of high poverty. Tourism, if unmanaged, may also \nresult in ecological and cultural impacts and provide few local benefits. To address these issues, \nthe government has initiated the National Program on Tourism Development, 2016\u20132030, which \naims to establish Mongolia as a global destination for nomadic culture.5 The program outlines a \nphased approach for tourism development that focuses initially on protected areas in northern, \ncentral, and eastern Mongolia. It prioritizes investments in visitor facilities, transport and sanitation \ninfrastructure, and community-based products and services. Five sites are listed to pilot and \ncatalyze ecotourism development, two of which are designated the highest priority: Khuvsgul Lake \nNational Park (KLNP) in Khuvsgul Aimag and Onon-Balj National Park (OBNP) in Khentii Aimag.6   \n                                                \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided technical assistance to design the project (ADB. 2016. Technical \nAssistance to Mongolia for the Sustainable Tourism Development Project. Manila). \n2  Ecotourism is defined as \u201cresponsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment, sustains the well-being \nof  local  people,  and  involves  interpretation  and  education\u201d.

Ulaanbaatar. \n6  The other three sites are the Orkhon Valley National Park, Ugii Nuur Ramsar site, and Tuv Aimag (central Mongolia). \nSites were selected based on high ecological and/or cultural values, poverty, and increasing visitor numbers. \n \n ", "2 \n5.  The KLNP (1.18 million hectares) and OBNP (0.42 million hectares) are the largest \nnational parks in northern and eastern Mongolia. Khuvsgul Lake in the KLNP is Mongolia\u2019s largest \nfreshwater resource.7 The OBNP is the documented birthplace of Chinggis Khaan, a historical \nleader revered in Mongolia. Both parks support global biodiversity values, small populations with \nhigh poverty rates,8 and transboundary river basins with the Russian Federation. Despite these \nsimilarities, the parks are at very different stages of tourism development. In 2017, the KLNP \nreceived about 89,000 visitors and the OBNP received about 20,400 visitors.9 Improved road and \nair access to the KLNP was established in 2010. Since then, visitor numbers have increased \nrapidly,  and  the  park  has  become  a major  national  tourism  destination. Growth  has  been \nunplanned and has resulted in severe seasonal congestion, damage to natural resources, and \nfew community benefits. In contrast, the OBNP has limited road and no air access, but a road to \nthe park will be constructed in 2021 as part of government efforts in regional tourism. Without \nplanning, this may result in rapid increases in visitor numbers and similar impacts as at the \nKLNP.10 The KLNP and OBNP reflect many of the challenges faced in developing sustainable \ntourism in Mongolia\u2019s protected areas, which require a focus on four key areas, as follows. \n \n6.  Limited inclusive planning and community benefits. Few KLNP and OBNP residents \nderive income from tourism, and most tour camp employees are external workers.11 This is due \nto several linked factors. At the institutional level, livelihood and tourism targets are not included \nin  the  soum  (county)  development  plans  for  either  park.  Residents  face  unique  planning \nrestrictions due to park regulations, yet soum and park management plans are not integrated. \nKhankh soum in the KLNP lacks any development plan but is the only soum in Mongolia located \nentirely within a protected area. At both parks, the issuance of licenses for tour camps is not based \non systematic procedures or social and environmental standards. This has favored external \noperators, which have greater access to finance and external markets. Most residents have low \ncapacity and capital to produce quality goods (e.g., handicrafts) or services (e.g., food supplies, \nguiding). Institutional support to promote local products and train residents is also limited.  \n \n7.  Insufficient enabling infrastructure. Public infrastructure in the KLNP and OBNP is \nlimited or outdated. This impacts park management and the visitor experience. At the KLNP, the \nclosest area to the provincial capital (Murun) for public access is a road along the shore of \nKhuvsgul Lake. This supports the park\u2019s highest numbers of tour camps, visitors, and vehicle \nactivity. The road is unsealed and lacks barriers, signs, or car parks. Access is uncontrolled. \nSections of lake shoreline are damaged from vehicle activity, and dust generated by vehicles is a \nsignificant source of lake pollution. The OBNP has few visitor facilities, roads, or car parks, yet \ntourism growth is expected (footnote 11) and requires infrastructure planning. Neither park has a \n                                                \n7  The lake contains 70% (380.7 cubic kilometers) of Mongolia\u2019s freshwater and 1% of global freshwater. C. Goulden \net al. 2006. The Geology, Biodiversity and Ecology of Lake H\u00f6vsg\u00f6l (Mongolia). Leiden: Backhuys Publishers. \n8  Khuvsgul and Khentii aimags exhibit high levels of poverty. In 2017, GDP per capita was $1,567 (Khuvsgul) and \n$1,842 (Khentii) versus a national mean of $3,591; and unemployment was 8.5% (Khuvsgul) and 10.1% (Khentii) \nversus a national rate of 7.5%. The KLNP and OBNP are located in 10 soums (counties), with poverty rates of 36%\u2013\n44%. In 2017, the total population in both parks was 36,573, of which about 25% was in three towns: Khatgal (3,195), \nKhankh (2,783) in the KLNP, and Dadal (3,006) in the OBNP. National Statistical Office. 2018. Mongolian Statistical \nYearbook 2017. Ulaanbaatar. \n9  From 2009 to 2017, visitor numbers rose by 572% in the KLNP and 528% in the OBNP (mean annual increases of \n38% and 32% respectively). Most arrivals (99%) are from June to August, according to visitor logbooks. \n10 Growth projections indicate that, by 2038, annual visitor numbers may have increased to about 161,000 at the KLNP \nand 136,000 at the OBNP. Sector Assessment (Summary): Multisector (Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Rural \nDevelopment; and Industry and Trade) (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n11 Tourism-related income is defined as any income-generating activity linked with tourism goods and/or services, \ne.g., guides, handicrafts, food suppliers, and camp employees. In 2018, 13.3% (2,650) of KLNP residents and 7.5% \n(1,249) of OBNP residents derived income from tourism. Sixty-three tour camps (50 in the KLNP and 13 in the OBNP) \noperated at the parks, with a total of 503 employees, of which 56% (283) employees were from other aimags. \n ", "3 \nvisitor center, which hinders fee collection, reduces the visitor\u2019s sense of \u201cdestination,\u201d and limits \nthe opportunity to inform visitors about park regulations and community goods and services. \nPublic trails are in poor condition, reducing visitor satisfaction and creating safety risks. \n \n8.  Inadequate waste management. The KLNP and OBNP have no organized systems for \nwaste collection or treatment. Public toilets are mostly unlined pits, and sewage seeps into the \nsoil and waterbodies. Landfill sites are present at each park, but are shallow, unlined excavations \nwith limited management. Projections based on population and tourism growth indicate that solid \nwaste generation will increase by over 290% by about 2038 (footnote 11). At the KLNP, the \npristine quality of Khuvsgul Lake is threatened by sewage disposal, dust (para. 7), and litter. For \nboth parks, poor sanitation is a key factor contributing to reduced visitor satisfaction. To address \nthese issues, traditional infrastructure solutions need to be combined with small, decentralized \nmethods tailored to local conditions and seasonal changes in visitor numbers. \n \n9.  Inadequate park management. The KLNP and OBNP administrations are underfunded \nand  have  limited  equipment  and  resources.  Entry  fees,  tourism  concessions,  and  central \ngovernment funding are key revenue sources for both parks, yet ticket collection booths are poorly \nlocated and campsites are not well managed, resulting in a loss of revenue. Park staff do not have \nthe training to plan for and manage tourism growth. Both parks have management plans, yet \nthese focus on biodiversity conservation and do not provide guidelines or targets for livelihoods, \ntourism, sanitation, and the management of park revenue streams. The impact of climate change \nis a cross-cutting issue that affects many management issues at the KLNP and OBNP. Increasing \ntemperatures, extreme rainfall events, and overgrazing contribute to soil exposure, permafrost \ndamage, algal blooms, and tree dieback, in a continuous cycle that also increases fire risk. \n \n10.  Government and donor efforts are addressing some of these issues. Grant projects funded \nby the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) have been implemented at the OBNP (2008\u2013\n2013) and KLNP (2016\u20132019), benefiting more than 4,000 residents through small business \ninitiatives and strengthened park management. Key initiatives included the establishment of \ncommunity revolving funds (for income diversification), a tourism council (to facilitate tourism \nplanning),  community  waste  management  teams  (CWMT)  (litter  control),  and  sustainable \nfinancing arrangements to maintain the revolving funds and pay team salaries through campsite \nand public toilet entry fees.12 Civil society organizations and other donors have provided support \nfor park equipment, ranger training, litter collection, and livelihoods. These measures have been \nsmall in scale yet provide a strong platform to scale up and achieve a holistic approach for \nconservation and development at the KLNP and OBNP. Continued focus on these two parks is a \npriority to (i) leverage previous efforts; (ii) establish a new focus on tourism management, tailored \nto each park; (iii) for the OBNP, manage the opportunities and risks posed by pending road \nconstruction; and (iv) complement donor efforts in other protected areas.13 \n \n11.  Strategic  fit.  The  project  is  aligned  with  Mongolia\u2019s  National  Program  on  Tourism \nDevelopment, 2016\u20132030 (footnote 6) which prioritizes the KLNP and OBNP for ecotourism \ndevelopment. It also supports the country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u20132020 of the Asian \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2008.

Other measures included the establishment of \ncommunity groups to improve resource management (OBNP); and piloting of water-efficient toilets (KLNP). For the \nOBNP, the JFPR-supported mechanisms established in 2008 to 2010 were reviewed and remain largely operational. \n13 Thompson, A. et al. 2014.

Lessons. The project designs reflect the experience gained from the JFPR grants at the \nKLNP  and  OBNP;  and  incorporate  best-practice  lessons  for  ecotourism,  sanitation,  and \ninfrastructure by ADB, civil society organizations, and other donors: (i) a multisector design that \naddresses the linked issues of livelihoods, tourism, waste, and conservation, tailored to the different \ntourism scenarios at each park; (ii) transport and waste management designs, which combine \nstructural and nonstructural measures; (iii) infrastructure designed for climate resilience, durability, \nand cost-effectiveness; (iv) the management of park revenue streams; and (v) capacity building, \nwhich builds on the grant trainings, focusing on the lead role of women for local tourism initiatives.15 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The  project  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  sustainable  economic  growth  and \nenvironmental improvement in Khuvsgul and Khentii aimags achieved (footnote 6). The project \nwill have the following outcome: sustainable and inclusive tourism in the KLNP and OBNP \ndeveloped.16 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n14.  Output 1: Inclusive planning and capacity for community-based tourism enhanced. \nThis output will strengthen the institutional framework for tourism planning and increase the \nnumber of local beneficiaries from tourism. The project will (i) revise the development plans for \nthe three largest settlements at the KLNP and OBNP to include livelihood targets, natural resource \nuse, and spatial planning for about 9,000 residents, based on growth projections and compatibility \nwith park management; (ii) establish tourism concession manuals and an ecotourism certification \nprogram for each park, to embed social and gender targets and environmental standards in the \nconcession process, strengthen links with local goods and services, and provide a stable business \nframework for 63 tour camp operators and more than 500 employees; (iii) strengthen the KLNP \ntourism council (para. 10) and replicate this at the OBNP to guide tourism planning; (iv) install \ninformation facilities in the Khuvsgul Aimag capital (the gateway for most visitors to the KLNP) to \npromote KLNP products and services; and (v) build on the previous community and gender \ninitiatives by providing vocational training for small tourism businesses and service providers, and \ninstalling 11 women-led tourist markets, as outlets for the JFPR-trained vendors. About 10,500 \nresidents (50% women)\u2014one-third of the population (footnote 9)\u2014will benefit from tour camp \njobs and/or new or expanded business opportunities. \n \n15.  Output 2: Enabling infrastructure for tourism constructed. At the KLNP, the project will \n(i) upgrade 37.9 kilometers (km) of unsealed roads; (ii) construct eight small car parks (linked with \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2017.

At the OBNP, the project will (i) construct a tourism center, the Chinggis Khaan Tourism \nComplex  (CKTC);  (ii)  establish  supporting  infrastructure,  comprising  ticket  collection  booths, \ninformation signs, and three car parks; and (iii) upgrade a short access road (2.6 km), and extend \n(by 4.5 km) the soum power line, to the CKTC site. The CKTC will catalyze and strengthen tourism \ndevelopment for the OBNP. It will be managed by a state-owned company, which will have a key \nmandate to (i) promote community-led tourism at the OBNP; and (ii) develop low-impact tourism \nactivities based on heritage, education, and conservation values. It will prioritize local employment \nand community goods and services and work closely with the OBNP tourism council (output 1) for \ntourism planning. For both parks, the project facilities will support the efficient management and \npublic entry of more than 5,000 visitors per day during peak season, reduced congestion, and \nimproved protection of the park core zones. \n \n16.  Output 3: Waste management improved. Output 3 will (i) facilitate the installation of low-\ncost and gender-sensitive toilet systems at about 102 tour camps, campsites, and project-funded \ncar parks. The project will replicate successful JFPR-funded toilet designs, procedures for \noperation and maintenance (O&M), and CWMTs, including sustainable financing for the CWMT \nsalaries (para. 10); and scale these up at the KLNP and OBNP; (ii) construct three wastewater \ntreatment plants (WWTPs); and (iii) upgrade three landfill sites, for a total new capacity of 72,500 \ncubic meters, and develop new procedures for recycling and waste management. The cumulative \nbenefits of the grant and loan-funded interventions will provide improved hygiene conditions for \nmore than 9,000 residents (about 50% women) and 290,000 visitors per year at both parks. \n \n17.  Output  4:  Park  management  strengthened.  Output  4  will  (i)  construct  a  KLNP \nheadquarters and visitor center, two fee collection stations, and a road control station. This will \nimprove revenue collection, strengthen the visitor experience, promote local goods and services, \nand improve protection of the park\u2019s core zone and wilderness values; (ii) rehabilitate 15 km of \npublic trails subject to high seasonal use; (iii) revise the KLNP and OBNP management plans with \nthe project measures, including O&M costs and financing sources for the project facilities;17 \n(iv) prepare a 4-year action plan for each park, to guide the implementation of the revised \nmanagement plans; and (v) train park and soum government staff (about 40% women) to \nimplement  the  revised  plans.  The  officially  endorsed  plans,  together  with  the  new  soum \ndevelopment plans (output 1), will provide the first comprehensive guidance for central and local \ngovernment to manage tourism, conservation, and development at the KLNP and OBNP. They \nwill align with provincial tourism plans and contribute to regional tourism development targets. \n \n18.  Promoting innovation, knowledge, and value added by ADB assistance. This will be \nthe first loan project for Mongolia to focus on tourism and protected area management. The designs \nscale up from measures established under two JFPR grants and other donor efforts, and match \nthese with physical investments and institutional planning. Key features include (i) piloting of the \nfirst tourism concession manuals and eco-certification program for protected areas in Mongolia; (ii) \nthe introduction of international standards for the construction and operation of rural landfills; (iii) \nadaptation measures to address adverse climate change impacts, including climate-resilient road \ndesigns  and  incorporation  of  climate  resilience  in  the  revised  park  management  and  soum \ndevelopment plans; (iv) infrastructure designs based on growth projections and cost efficiency; and \n                                                \n17 O&M costs for the project facilities have been established. Project revenue streams and O&M financing sources \ninclude income from the tourism concessions (output 1) and entry fees for the parks, visitor centers, public toilets, \nand campsites (outputs 2\u20134). Opportunities for public\u2013private partnerships to manage the WWTPs, landfills, and \nvisitor centers will be assessed during implementation. \n \n ", "6 \n(v) cross-cutting links between each output, including the integrated siting of roads, car parks, public \ntoilets, and tourist markets.

The project is technically feasible. Engineering solutions were designed considering costs \nof construction and O&M, durability, climate, and impacts to aesthetic, cultural, and wilderness \n                                                \n22 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nvalues, tailored to the unique context of the two protected areas. Climate resilience measures \ninclude insulated road bases to strengthen cold tolerance and protect subsurface permafrost, non-\nflushing toilet units for water saving, and energy-efficient passive heating for the visitor centers. \nDesigns for the WWTPs comprise proven, low-cost technology suitable for cold climates and \napplied elsewhere in Mongolia. The landfill sites will be constructed on existing open dumpsites and \nuse impermeable clay lining to avoid soil and water pollution. The design capacities for the WWTPs \nand landfills meet the projected demand for at least the first 15 years of operation. O&M procedures \nand financing will be incorporated into the revised KLNP and OBNP management plans. The project \ncomponents for institutional strengthening, tourism, and waste management apply the measures \ndesigned and tested under the JFPR grants, including replication of the tourism councils (for \ndestination management), CWMTs (for solid waste collection), and toilet designs. \n  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  The economic analysis indicated that the project is economically viable, with an overall \neconomic internal rate of return of 17.8% and an economic net present value of MNT86.0 billion. \nSensitivity analysis indicated that the project is robust to negative scenarios, including increases \nin investment and/or O&M costs, and benefits reduction. The economic benefits of the project are \nexpected to be significantly higher, as some effects such as ecological benefits are not easily \nquantifiable. The financial analysis included assessment of the financial sustainability of the \nproject, and the capacity of the executing and implementing agencies to fund recurrent costs. \nFinancial sustainability was assessed based on the fiscal impact of counterpart funding for the \nproject and incremental recurrent costs, including O&M costs. The fiscal impacts are well within \nthe government\u2019s projected revenue capacities, although similar to most ministries in Mongolia, \nthe implementing agencies depend substantially on central government funding. This poses a \nsubstantial risk to the financial sustainability of the project. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n25.  The financial management risk for the executing and implementing agencies before \nconsidering mitigation measures is substantial and the procurement risk is moderate. Constraints \ninclude a lack of qualified financial management and procurement staff within the implementing \nagencies. The financial division of the Ministry of Environment and Tourism (MET), given its \nexperience with ADB- and other donor-funded projects, will take overall responsibility for the \nproject financial management. Measures to mitigate the financial management and procurement \nrisks are in the financial management assessment23 and PAM; and include the appointment of a \nqualified  accountant  and  procurement  specialist  within  the  project  implementation  unit  and \ntraining on ADB disbursement. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was \nexplained to and discussed with the executing and implementing agencies. The specific policy \nrequirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 21). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n26.  The project will contribute to poverty reduction and inclusive development in Khuvsgul and \nKhentii aimags. About 3,057 households, representing about 11,009 people in 10 soums in the \nKLNP and OBNP are expected to benefit from the project, through new and/or diversified \nlivelihoods resulting from new and expanded community-based tourism activities, provision of \ngoods and services to tour camps and visitors, and employment with tourism businesses. The \nproject will also create about 149 jobs during construction and about 87 jobs for O&M of the \n                                                \n23 Financial Management Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nproject facilities. It will provide training to strengthen local businesses and tourism value chains. \n \n27.  The project is classified effective gender mainstreaming following ADB guidelines, and a \nsocial and gender action plan has been prepared.24 Gender targets include (i) a lead role by local \nwomen\u2019s groups to manage the project-supported tourist markets; (ii) at least 50% of stalls in the \nproject-supported tourist markets to be allocated to female vendors; (iii) 50% female participation in \nthe project trainings and consultations; (iv) allocation of 40% of jobs during project construction to \nwomen; and (v) the inclusion of gender-responsive facilities at construction sites, including separate \ntoilets for women. A project consultation and participation plan and a stakeholder communication \nstrategy have been prepared and are described in the PAM (footnote 21). The plans are based on \nconsultations with civil society during project preparation, with guidance from ADB\u2019s NGO and Civil \nSociety Center,25 and emphasize consultation and participation throughout implementation. \n \nE.  Safeguards  \n \n28.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.26 \n \n29.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE), including an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP), has been prepared. The IEE complies with ADB\u2019s \nSafeguard Policy Statement requirements for works in protected areas and Mongolia\u2019s Special \nLaw on Protected Areas, 2014. All project works are limited to the multiple-use and/or buffer zones \nof the KLNP and OBNP, are consistent with the park management plans, and will improve \nprotection of the park core zones. The EMP includes mitigation, monitoring, and reporting \nrequirements  for  environmental  management  during  construction  and  operation.  A  project-\nspecific grievance redress mechanism has been prepared. The executing and implementing \nagencies have limited experience in safeguard implementation, and a capacity-building program \nis included in the EMP. The project implementation unit will include a qualified environmental \nsafeguard specialist, who will coordinate EMP implementation. The IEE is consistent with two \ndomestic environmental assessments prepared for the project and approved by MET. \n \n30.  The  project  is  designed  to  achieve  significant  environmental  benefits,  including  the \nimproved management of two globally important protected areas, and protection of Mongolia\u2019s \nmost important freshwater resource, Khuvsgul Lake. Construction risks include short-term noise \nand dust disturbance, damage to permafrost during road upgrade works, and the close proximity \nof some works to sacred sites. Operational risks include cumulative and induced pressures on \nland and water resources resulting from increased tourism development. An integrated approach \nfor  designs  and  safeguards  was  adopted  to  address  these  issues,  based  on  surveys, \nconsultations,  and  best  practice  engineering  standards.  Mitigation  measures  include  strict \nprotection of permafrost during construction, community-led delineation of sacred sites before \nworks, and institutional strengthening for tourism planning and park management. \n \n31.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project is not expected to involve involuntary \nresettlement. All civil works will be implemented on state-owned lands and will not involve \nacquisition of non-state lands, physical or economic displacement, or restriction on land use. \n \n32.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project is not expected to impact ethnic minorities \n                                                \n24 Social and Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25 ADB. 2017.

The government and MET have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and MET have agreed with ADB on certain \ncovenants for the project, which are set forth in two draft loan agreements. No withdrawals shall \nbe made from the loan accounts until a project implementation unit has been established and a \nqualified project coordinator, financial specialist, and procurement specialist have been engaged. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n35.  I am satisfied that the proposed loans would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve, for the Mongolia \nSustainable Tourism Development Project, (i) the loan of $19,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources, in regular terms, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; for a term of 26 years, including a grace \nperiod of 5 years; and (ii) the loan of $19,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, in \nconcessional terms, with an interest charge at the rate of 2% per year during the grace period \nand 2% per year thereafter; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and, in the \ncase of both loans, such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft loan agreements presented to the Board. \n \nTakehiko Nakao  \nPresident \n24 April 2019 \n                                                \n27 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the Project is Aligned with \nSustainable economic growth and environmental improvement in Khuvsgul and Khentii aimags achieved (National \nProgram on Tourism Development, 2016\u20132030)a \n  \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2025:     \nSustainable and  a.
