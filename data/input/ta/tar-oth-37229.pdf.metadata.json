The Asian Development Bank (ADB), as the leading development institution for the Asia \nand Pacific region, has a crucial role in responding to regional emergencies.  The recent \noutbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)1 in a number of economies in the region \n(primarily the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); Hong Kong, China; Taipei,China; Singapore; \nand Viet Nam) is an international emergency due to the possibility of a major epidemic, with \nhigh human death toll and adverse effects on health services, and on political and economic \nstability; with long-lasting social and economic damage to the region and its institutions; and \nwhich may disproportionately affect poor and vulnerable groups. While the scale of the epidemic \nis still uncertain, given the gravity of potential scenarios, immediate action is essential. Based on \nassessments of leading institutions like the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United \nStates\u2019  Center  for  Communicable  Diseases  Control,  an  emergency  response  is  required \nthroughout  the  region.  Accordingly,  ADB  is  called  upon  to  use  its  financial  and  technical \nresources  to  mount  such  a  response,  addressing  immediate  needs  and  long-term \npreparedness, in support of developing member countries (DMCs) and in close coordination \nwith other development partners in the region. \n \n2.  On  25  April  2003,  the  President  requested  an  emergency  action  plan  to  address \noutbreak of SARS in the region. ADB\u2019s SARS Crisis Response Team met from 25 April to 2 May \n2003 and developed a comprehensive proposal,2 approved by the President on 7 May 2003, to \nmeet the immediate needs of SARS-affected and potential SARS-affected developing member \ncountries (DMCs). The proposal included the development of an emergency regional technical \nassistance (TA) that will enable ADB to assist its DMCs, in a flexible manner, to prevent, reduce \nand eliminate the spread of SARS in DMCs.3 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  SARS  epidemic  that  is  currently  sweeping  East  Asia  poses  to  the  region  an \nextremely serious threat that requires an immediate response to control its spread. At present, \nlittle is known about the origin of the SARS virus or how it is spread. Although SARS appears to \nhave originated in southeastern PRC, it has spread quickly and has been reported in around 30 \ncountries and territories. Increased regional trade and globalization have spread of the SARS \nepidemic. As of 8 May 2003, there were 7,053 cases of SARS worldwide and 506 deaths.4 The \nfatality rate from SARS appears to be quite high, at around 15-20% (up to 55% for patients over \n605).  Current  treatment  is  not  very  effective  against  SARS.  Laboratories  are  working  on \n                                                 \n1 SARS is an acute systemic viral infection starting with influenza-type symptoms like fever and headache, likely \ntransmitted through infected air droplets or other body particles from patients and possibly carriers, and often \nprogressing into severe pneumonia with reported case fatality rates of up to 20% in adults and 50% in the elderly.  \n2 ADB.  2003.

Given the lack of understanding about how the disease spreads and the potential for it to \nspread, early action to limit and control the spread of SARS is a key international public good. \nThe poor and rural populations may be at particular risk due to the lack of access to hospital \nservices  and  limited  capacity  to  diagnose  the  disease  properly.  SARS  could  become  a \npandemic with major loss of life throughout the world.    \n \n5.  SARS is already having a major economic, social, and psychological impact on the \npopulation of the countries most affected by the disease. Initially, the economic impact has hit \ntravel-related  industries  the  hardest.  If  the  SARS  contagion  continues  for  several  months, \nforeign  direct  investment,  labor  remittances,  and  exports  are  also  likely  to  be  negatively \naffected.6 Beyond the economic costs, SARS is also generating significant social costs. Schools \nin many SARS-affected countries have been closed for extended periods of time. The health \nsystem in many countries is under strain due to weak infrastructure, low availability of medicine, \nand increased risk for health workers. The impact on the health sector could rise exponentially \nas the epidemics spreads to poor countries with limited disease control and treatment. \n \n6.  Stopping the spread of SARS requires significant, decisive, and coordinated action by all \nstakeholders. The lessons learned from successful countries show the importance of acting in a \ntransparent and decisive manner to fight SARS. This requires the mobilization of support on \ndomestic and international fronts.  \n \n7.   The health sector is on the front line of the battle against the SARS epidemic, both in its \nrole as provider of health services to the public and as victims in terms of the high toll SARS has \nalready taken on health sector workers. Key categories of need include \n \n(i)  the capacity of the public, private, and NGO-managed health sector to assess \nand monitor the SARS epidemic (and other emerging diseases); \n(ii)  the capacity of the health sector to handle and cure suspected and probable \nSARS  patients  (health  facilities,  medical  and  laboratory  equipment,  and \nsupplies); \n(iii)  the immediate needs of health personnel for information, protection, and training; \n(iv)  basic information, education, and communication (IEC) campaigns for health \nprofessionals and the public on SARS; and \n(v)  hygienic disinfection and appropriate sanitary measures in affected areas. \n \n8.  In many DMCs, governments and health systems are ill-prepared to deal with SARS. \nMany governments have a tight fiscal balance, and cannot mobilize resources quickly.  ADB has \nan important role to play, in coordination with WHO and other partners, to help build the \nemergency response in affected countries and other countries at risk in the region. Using its \nnetwork of staff and financial resources, ADB can draw upon active social sector projects in \nmost of its DMCs to quickly mobilize urgently needed inputs to combat SARS.   \n \n                                                 \n6 ADB.  2003.

THE PROPOSED REGIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The  proposed  TA  will  provide  emergency  assistance  to  strengthen  DMCs\u2019  health \nsystems\u2019 capacities to help prevent and contain outbreaks of SARS over the next six months. \nThe proposed TA will fill gaps identified in financing to meet the SARS epidemic. ADB will work \nclosely  with  governments,  WHO,  and  other  stakeholders,  in  particular  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  to  identify  the  gaps,  both  quantitatively  (how  much  is  needed)  and \nqualitatively  (where  are  the  resources  needed).  The  magnitude  of  the  damage  the  SARS \nepidemic will cause is difficult to estimate, but ADB should be prepared to respond quickly and \nflexibly to the actual and potential damage caused by SARS. Although completing the task of \nstrengthening health systems\u2019 capacity to prevent and contain SARS and other outbreaks will \nrequire a medium- to long-term effort, the emergency measures implemented under the TA can \nprovide important first steps. The TA framework is contained in Appendix 1.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  Given the uncertain and evolving nature of the SARS epidemic, the design of the TA is \nnecessarily flexible to meet the emerging needs of DMCs. ADB staff will work with governments, \nWHO, development partners, NGOs and other stakeholders to determine each country's urgent \nfinancial needs to combat SARS. In broad terms, the TA will have three components (Appendix \n2 outlines some possible activities). \n \n11.  Emergency  Assistance  to  SARS-Affected  and  Potentially  SARS-Affected \nCountries. The main priority of the TA will be to provide initial support to build the capacity of \nhealth  systems  to  prevent  and  control  SARS.  This  assistance  will  support  public  health \nassessment, surveillance, training, and institutional capacity building (all of which may include \nthe  emergency  provision  of  public  health  equipment,  material,  and  supplies);  standardized \nprocedures for screening and restricting cross-border travelers; and information and education \ncampaigns on SARS. Beneficiaries should be key partners, such as ministries of health, local \nhealth authorities, and NGOs. The TA can also work in coordination with regional initiatives \nsuch as implementing agreements in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Joint \nDeclaration Of The Special ASEAN Leaders Meeting On SARS, Bangkok, Thailand, 29 April \n2003, and the proposed joint initiative between the South Pacific Commission and ADB: Support \nto  the  Development  of  Communicable  Diseases  Surveillance  In  the  Pacific  Region.  The \nemergency assistance will be determined based on country and regional needs assessment \nand local capacity to respond to immediate SARS-related needs. \n \n12.  Economic Impact Assessments. To address the needs of countries to assess the risks \nthat they face from SARS, the TA will support rapid assessments of the capacity of health \nsystems to deal with SARS and the potential effect of SARS on the economy. This will help \nimprove DMCs\u2019 understanding of the potential effects of SARS on their socioeconomic patterns \nand allow for the preparation of appropriate responses. Other assessments are ongoing, but this \ncomponent will fill gaps in analysis needed to carry out the work of the other two components. \nThe TA will also facilitate aggregation of assessments and other emerging SARS knowledge \nacross DMCs to allow effective sharing of good practices and to better enable a regional \napproach to SARS issues. \n \n13.  Analysis of Required Investment Response. This component includes the provision of \nsmall-scale project preparatory TA for additional short- and medium-term responses to the ", "4 \nSARS epidemic and other emerging contagions. ADB and other financial institutions are already \ncarrying out preliminary work in some DMCs. This component will provide additional technical \nsupport to assist in the redesign of existing investments by ADB and other financiers, and will \nfacilitate  the  development  of  future  investment  projects  to  meet  long-term  needs  for \ncommunicable disease control.   \n \n14.  The  TA  will  support  expert  services  and  required  related  facilities.  Other  funding \nagencies may be providing SARS-related TA in a given member country. ADB has contacted 22 \nDMCs7 considered to be affected by or at risk to SARS. Some countries have already indicated \nwillingness to participate, and most others are expected to join. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2 million equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. ADB and its partners will also actively seek \nadditional grant cofinancing. Appendix 3 contains the cost estimate and financing plan. Given \nthe need for a flexible response, the estimates are likely to change as the TA evolves.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented by ADB. The Agriculture, Natural Resources, and Social \nSector Division (RSAN) of Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD), in \nassociation with concerned divisions in the regional departments, will be responsible for all TA \nactivities.  The  SARS  Crisis  Team,  comprising  representatives  of  central  and  regional \ndepartments within ADB, will serve as the TA team. The principal regional cooperation specialist \nof the Governance and Regional Cooperation Division will coordinate the team\u2019s activities, with \nthe senior health and nutrition specialist of RSAN as alternate. The implementation of TA \nactivities  may  be  delegated  to  operational  divisions  concerned  as  appropriate.  Each \nparticipating DMC will designate an institutional focal point, and a project coordinator as the key \nperson to interact with other government agencies, and with the consultants appointed under \nthe TA. Regional organizations such as ASEAN may also appoint a project coordinator to \nparticipate on behalf of their members. With technical guidance from WHO (in line with a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  being  formulated  separately),  the  SARS  Crisis  Team  and \nDirector, RSAN, will review and approve requests for assistance. These will be initiated by \nproject coordinators on behalf of their countries, working jointly with the concerned regional \ndepartment  (and  in  dialogue  with  WHO,  as  needed)  to  formulate  a  simplified  technical \nassistance paper, which will consist of a short description of the needs, a brief implementation \nstrategy  indicating  the  national  or  regional  implementing  agency,  a  proposed  budget,  and \n(where applicable), outline terms of reference for consultants and list of items to be procured. \nParticipating  DMCs  will  make  in-kind  contributions  in  the  form  of  office  space,  local  travel, \nremuneration of counterpart and supporting staff, office facilities and utilities, and workshop support. \n \n17.  A steering committee comprising directors of the concerned divisions in ADB\u2019s regional \ndepartments and RSDD will provide overall guidance to and supervision of the TA activities, and \nwill endorse criteria for eligibility and prioritization. These criteria will ensure incentives for quick \nresponse, focus on priority countries, and efficient use of limited resources. The criteria may be \nmodified as the SARS outbreak evolves, and if additional resources become available.  \n                                                 \n7 Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, the PRC, East Timor, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, \nLao Peoples\u2019 Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Sri \nLanka, Tajikistan, Thailand, Uzbekistan, and Viet Nam. \n ", "    5 \n \n18.  TA implementation arrangements will provide flexibility to allow adjustment in the terms \nof reference of consultants, duration, and schedule of expert inputs. In dialogue with local \nauthorities,  ADB  will  establish  appropriate  mechanisms  to  handle  requests  for  funding. \nDomestic and international consultants will be selected based on identified needs and country \ncapacities. Consultants will be engaged as individuals, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of \ndomestic consultants. Resource speakers will be directly selected to facilitate the training, \ndevelopment, and dissemination of information, education, and communication (IEC) materials. \nOther consultant recruitment will follow the ADB\u2019s procedures with reasonable flexibility, such as \nwaiving of standard provisions for ADB Business Opportunities (ADBBO) listing and shortened \nprocessing timing for negotiations and contracts. If direct selection is deemed necessary to \nrecruit  consultants  other  than  resource  speakers  during  TA  implementation,  appropriate \napproval authority will be sought on a case-by-case basis. Related facilities and supplies will be \nprocured in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB. Indicative procurement options \nare included in Appendix 3.   \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented from May to December 2003. Given the need for flexibility, \nmonthly reviews will assess implementation arrangements and adjustments will be made as \nappropriate.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n20.

For all participating countries, assistance falls into three broad categories. \n \nA.  Health Sector Assistance \n2.  Goods, consultants, and personnel should play a role in preventing the spread of severe \nacute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and in organizing the  \n \n(i)  training and capacity building for health workers; \n(ii)  personal protective equipment for health workers and other personnel at risk; \n(iii)  medical equipment necessary for trained health workers; and \n(iv)  laboratory  equipment  for  public  health  surveillance,  hospital,  and \nquarantine/isolation units. \n \nB.  Data Collection and Statistical Analysis of SARS\u2019 Prevalence and Multiple Impacts \non Population Health and Economy \n3.  Eligible items include specialized software for epidemiological and economic analysis, \nspecial rapid surveys, training, and consultants. Ongoing epidemiological assessment and a \nspecial health information system adaptable to decentralized management may be amplified; \ncomputer-based surveillance infrastructure support, with related procurement of equipment, \nmay be purchased. \n4.  Support for national or subnational regional health education campaigns to alert the \npublic about SARS\u2019 risks, protective behavior, and access to emergency assistance for high-risk \ngroups. All aspects of such campaigns, from preparation, testing, printing, and distribution of \ninformation, education, and communication materials; focus group dialogues and application of \nmultimedia and informal/ distance learning methods will be eligible. Training of media and \nsurvey field staff, with attendant consultant requirements, will be eligible. \nC.  Analysis of Required Investment Response \n5.  This component will support the redesign of ongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nprojects and facilitate the development of future ADB projects for additional short- and medium-\nterm responses to the SARS epidemic and other emerging contagions. The component could \nalso support the development of (i) medium- and long-term action plans; (ii) procurement plans \nto meet long-term needs for communicable disease control; and (iii) strategies to meet the \nfinancing gap, using funds from ADB and others. This support will likely be through domestic \nand international consultancy and the organization and financing of workshops and seminars.  \n \n6.  Support under each of these categories should complement, and not duplicate, other \nassistance being provided to fight SARS. The proposed technical assistance (TA) will focus \nprimarily on the soft side of health system capacity building but will provide equipment where \nnecessary and appropriate. ADB is defining a package of essential surveillance and infection \ncontrol assistance program package with the World Health Organization (WHO). The TA may \nprovide financing to purchase parts of the package, or to support related and complementary \nmaterials in coordination with other development partners and the efforts of the Governments of \nthe member countries.
