Indonesia aims to strengthen its capacity for \nentrepreneurship. The TA will support an evaluation of four or five entrepreneurship \nprograms and/or programs to link universities with industry. This will include programs run \nby  (a)  the  Japan  International  Corporation  Agency;  (b)  the  Asian  Entrepreneurship \nTraining Program, supported by the Zurich University of Applied Sciences and the Swiss \nFederal  Institute  of  Technology;  and  (c)  private  initiatives. 7  The  TA  will  support \nindependent  evaluations  of  these  programs  to  develop  lessons  learned  for  higher-\neducation institutions and future entrepreneurship programs. \n \n(ii) Skills for a new technology sector. The TA will support a holistic analysis of labor \ndemand and supply trends in a selected industry to fully understand its challenges. The \nelectricity sector is proposed, as it is an important sector in Indonesia that is undergoing \nrapid change because of new technological developments. It is also a sector in which ADB \nprovides significant support. Future needs will be influenced by expansion, a shift to \nsustainable energy, and the introduction of smart systems. The approach will build upon \nlessons learned from an earlier study conducted on demand and supply in the maritime \nsector by the Education Sector Analytical and Capacity Development Partnership.8 A local \nnongovernment organization with a strong grassroots network will be engaged to conduct \nthe analysis. \n \n(iii) Improving  employability.  The  TA  will  support  analytical  work  to  identify  how  the \nemployability of graduates can improve. The TA will build upon the experiences and \nresults of the pilots, which are planned for 2019. In these pilots, a program to support the \ntransition from school to work for graduates and a program to support upskilling of workers \nwill be tested. 9 Based upon the lessons learned from these pilots, the proposed TA will \n                                                \n6  These pilot assessments will not have any impact on the environment. \n7  The Japan International Corporation Agency programs were or are implemented in Gadjah Mada University, \nHasanuddin  University,  and  the  Electronic  Engineering  Polytechnic  Institute  of  Surabaya.  The  Asian \nEntrepreneurship Training Program aims to provide targeted coaching during a few intensive working sessions in \nwhich joint Swiss and Indonesian teams work on their proposals. The program is a pilot within the Swiss bilateral \nScience and Technology Cooperation with Asia (funded by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and \nInnovation) and is planned for implementation in 2019. A possible national private program would be Lingkaran's \nBusiness Starter Pack program, a 3-month short course for budding entrepreneurs in Jakarta.
