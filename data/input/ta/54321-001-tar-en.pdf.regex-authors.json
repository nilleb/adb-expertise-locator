INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support developing member \ncountries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in using artificial intelligence, satellite \nimagery, and Earth observation solutions for project planning and implementation. The TA will \ncover the development of cloud-based platforms to process satellite data and produce models on \nland use management and coastal planning as well as capacity building programs for relevant \nagencies. The TA will prioritize solutions to address DMC institutional constraints linked to the \nlack of awareness on the available effective technologies, insufficient regulatory processes, or \nlimited dissemination of best practices. It will prove that technical capacity in the DMCs can be \neasily improved, and the cost\u2013benefit ratio is more favorable than other solutions. These solutions \nwill be for land use management and coastal planning in Cambodia, development of a sustainable \ncoffee sector in Timor-Leste, optimization of cropping systems in Uzbekistan, and land use \nplanning in Tonga. \n \n2.  Strategy 2030 recognizes the promotion of innovative technology as a guiding principle \nand aims to \u201cseek ways to promote the use of advanced technologies across its operations and \nprovide capacity building support to DMCs.\u201d1 Earth observation is one such advanced tool. The \nuse of satellite-based Earth observation products has advanced significantly since 2010 in the \npast decade for a broad range of uses, including environmental and disaster risk management, \nurban planning and land management, and knowledge-intensive agriculture. These innovative \nsolutions cut across the operational priorities, specifically (i) tackling climate change, building \nclimate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability (OP3); (ii) making \ncities more livable (OP4); (iii) promoting rural development and food security (OP5); and (iv) \nstrengthening governance and institutional capacity (OP6). \n \n3.  The TA is included in the 2020 Management-approved results-based work plan of the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  ADB stopped project site visits because of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, \neven in conflict-affected situations, hindering more effective project design, implementation, and \nmonitoring. This highlights the usefulness of satellite imagery, which allows virtual visits to sites \nthat cannot be easily accessed or studied to plan or implement interventions. However, DMCs \noften are unable to use free and open multispectral satellite data systematically and unable to \nleverage the technology to improve nationwide planning and make decisions based on up-to-date \nand accurate information. DMC capacity to access and process such free and open raw datasets \nis also limited or fragmented. Further, there is rampant institutional absence of national guidelines \nand support structures that promote the use of processed satellite data. Some DMCs also have \nlimited awareness of the cost\u2013benefit advantages of new technologies demonstrated locally. \n \n5.  This TA aims to reduce the technology gaps for cloud-based processing; raise awareness \nof the need for local guidelines; and provide a cost\u2013benefit analysis of using artificial intelligence, \nsatellite imagery, and Earth observation solutions compared with traditional practices. \n \n \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. p. 11. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 12 October 2020. \n ", "2 \n6.  Satellites provide nonintrusive, objective, and consistent historic and projected data.3 The \ntechnology is also rapidly evolving. New multispectral imagery is now available, and the frequency \nand resolution of image captures have increased, significantly expanding potential uses. DMCs \ncan improve the accuracy of land use models and reduce the cost of land surveys by transitioning \nto Earth observation-based solutions. In addition, Earth observation can provide reliable data \nwhen actual field surveys are difficult to conduct because of COVID-19 pandemic-related travel \nrestrictions or in cases of conflict. Satellites are also among the few free and open data sources \nthat systematically monitor land use. \n \n7.  Combined with artificial intelligence, satellite imagery is driving a global revolution in land \nmanagement. Much of the new and improved imagery is available as a free and open resource \nfrom space agencies such as the European Space Agency (ESA). Artificial intelligence has also \nadvanced rapidly, and artificial intelligence-based image recognition models can automatically \nidentify land features and uses with high accuracy. Satellite technology with artificial intelligence-\nbased image processing can enable ADB DMCs to avoid traditional data gathering and analysis \nsolutions that are often too expensive and complex. DMCs are well-positioned to take advantage \nof Earth observation solutions, given their lack of historical investments in land management \ninfrastructure. However, some DMCs have limited technical capability or inadequate information \ntechnology systems to perform the technical processing required for these solutions. Because \nsome platforms do not offer training for DMCs, this TA will build DMC capacity to implement these \nEarth observation solutions. \n \n8.  In response to DMC demand for Earth observation-based interventions, the TA aims to \ncreate artificial intelligence solutions using open data from space agencies, such as ESA, the \nJapan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI); and \nacademic institutions, such as the University of Tokyo. The TA will focus on processing Earth \nobservation-based image data to create sustainable and replicable solutions for decision makers. \nThe  Sustainable  Development  and  Climate  Change  Department\u2019s  Digital  Technology  for \nDevelopment  Unit  (SDCC-DT)  has  provided  considerable  support  through  TA,  integrating \nrelevant data into planning and implementation. For example, Indonesia\u2019s Ministry of National \nDevelopment Planning, National Institute of Aeronautics and Space, Ministry of Public Works and \nHousing, and Geological Service housed in the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources used \ntwo cloud-based interferometric processing platforms, the Geohazards Exploitation Platform4 and \nRheticus,5 in project preparation activities for the reconstruction of Palu in Central Sulawesi and \nfor the management of water resources in Java.6 \n \n9.  To achieve the TA objectives, ADB will collaborate with government agencies that can \nsustain the operational use of these cloud-based solutions. This approach is based on the \nexperience in Indonesia, where cloud processing is being used to optimize the implementation of \nwater security, flood risk, and post-tsunami reconstruction projects. SDCC-DT will regularly \nconsult with DMCs and operations departments on the most appropriate technology. This TA \nfocuses  on  land  use  management  and  coastal  planning  in  Cambodia,  development  of  a \nsustainable coffee sector in Timor-Leste, optimization of cropping systems in Uzbekistan, and \n \n3  ADB. 2017. Earth Observation for a Transforming Asia and the Pacific: A Portfolio of Twelve Earth Observation \nProjects Supporting Asian Development Bank Activities. Manila. \n4  Geohazards Exploitation Platform. The platform allows external users to employ Earth observation data by combining \nfast data access, cloud processing facilities, and intuitive data analysis tools. \n5  Planetek Italia. Rheticus.

To \naddress future use of the cloud-based platform, this TA will foster integration into DMC systems \nor create sustainable customized links with tools created by ESA and other partners. \n \n10.  The TA will build on previous ADB projects where satellite imagery has been used to \ndevelop and pilot-test land use solutions. These include activities organized for Emergency \nAssistance for Reconstruction and Rehabilitation in Indonesia, where initial support was provided \nunder ESA\u2019s Earth Observation for Sustainable Development Disaster Risk Reduction project and \ndelivered the first damage assessment in the country and monthly land and infrastructure motion \nanalytics.7 It will also build on the work for an upcoming project in Cambodia on monitoring coastal \nand marine fisheries and associated ecosystems using artificial intelligence to detect oceanfront \ngradients associated with water upwelling. Earth observation technology will be used to monitor \nthe health of coastal mangrove ecosystems that serve as a nursery for marine life. The TA will \nalso build on a grant in Timor-Leste,8 in which artificial intelligence is used to identify coffee \nplantations from optical multispectral satellite images. For this project, multispectral imagery \naccurately identified coffee plantations under a forest canopy, reducing the need for physical \nsurveys in hard-to-reach mountainous terrain. Once the model is created and validated, it can be \nused to monitor national coffee production for economic and agricultural planning. \n \n11.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB\u2019s value addition would be leveraging partnerships with ESA \nand the University of Tokyo, and upcoming collaborations with the Japan Aerospace Exploration \nAgency and KARI to provide the most appropriate Earth observation-based solutions to the DMCs, \nincluding historical data, satellite images, and modeling and forecasting methodologies. ADB \nresources may also be used for storage and dissemination.9 ADB is in a unique position to provide \nstate-of-the-art solutions to DMCs, with their varying needs, from these agencies. Working directly \nwith the DMCs, ADB can identify applicable solutions for small and remote Pacific islands, \nlandlocked countries in Central Asia, or archipelagos in Southeast Asia. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: use of advanced technologies in land use \nplanning  and  natural  resources  management  increased.10 The  TA  will  have  the  following \noutcome: capacity of DMCs to use free and open multispectral satellite data improved.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n13.  Output 1: Cloud-based platforms operationalized. The TA will support the use of state-\nof-the art, machine learning techniques to process terabytes of free and open satellite data from \n \n7  ADB. Indonesia: Emergency Assistance for Rehabilitation and Reconstruction; and ESA. Earth Observation for \nSustainable Development Disaster Risk Reduction. The ESA initiative supports the uptake of Earth observation-\nderived information in sustainable development. It comprises knowledge development, capacity building, and skills \ntransfer, which were done in coordination with ADB and the World Bank. \n8  ADB. 2020.

Similar solutions will be evaluated in consultation with the Southeast Asia \nDepartment\u2019s Urban Development and Water Division project team for the Southeast Asia Urban Services Facility. \n10 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nsensors at different spatial resolutions.12 This includes technical cooperation with KARI to access \nits marine information service based on Cheollian 2B.13 ESA will integrate Sentinel-314 and \nCheollian 2B multispectral data and make available artificial intelligence expertise to process data \ninto a coastal marine water monitoring processing chain. This will allow using available datasets \nto support areas such as agroforestry and sustainable coastal fisheries. Consultations with \nrelevant users will be conducted to test different use-case scenarios and decide on the most \nappropriate cloud-based solution. \n \n14.  Output  2:  Integration  of  Earth  observation  technology  solutions  into  projects \nsupported. The TA will support mainstreaming of Earth observation technology to produce maps \n(e.g., land use, land cover, marine environment, and coffee plantation). Similar solutions can be \nreplicated in other sectors and DMCs. This output will use KARI\u2019s Cheollian 2B and other available \ntools from space agencies such as ESA, integrate satellite data in the cloud, and validate results \nwith DMCs. \n \n15.  Output 3: Knowledge in adopting Earth observation-based solutions improved. The \nTA will support hosting the artificial intelligence model, processing imagery, connecting to free \nand open data archives, and storing results in a cloud-based platform with a user-friendly interface \nto foster uptake in DMCs that lack major investments in local information technology infrastructure. \nUser training sessions will be organized, and knowledge products will be disseminated. \n \n16.  On-site training will also be conducted, as necessary and as permitted by local COVID-19 \ndirectives. A sizable portion of the capacity building training will be delivered remotely during the \nfirst year of activities. DMCs not targeted by this TA will be invited to join the virtual training. To \nprovide efficient virtual training, an enhanced methodology will be designed and will consist of \nhighly structured training modules, including on building a virtual community and providing \ntangible values for inclusion in participants\u2019 working practices. \n \nC.
