The  regional  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  thematic  self-\nassessment  and  peer  review  of  International  Association  of  Insurance  Supervisors  (IAIS) \ninsurance core principles and standards for Asia and Pacific (Phase 1) will provide assistance to \nthe developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to implement \neffective and globally consistent supervision of the insurance subsector.  ADB, a nonvoting \nmember of the IAIS, will help DMCs align their regulations with international best practices to \npromote  a  well-diversified  financial  sector.  With  uncertain  growth  prospects  and  shrinking \nbudgetary  resources,  the  insurance  subsector  can  play  an  increasingly  important  role. \nGovernments are looking for options to transfer significant risks to be managed by households \nthrough insurance mechanisms in the wake of increasing longevity, rising pension and health \ncare  costs,  increasing  natural  disasters  and  climate  change  events,  and  other  financially \ndestabilizing occurrences. Households buying insurance should trust the providers of insurance \nand sound insurance regulation ensures that the reasonable expectations of policy holders are \nmet at all times.  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Financial  markets  in  most  of the  DMCs  are  at  various  stages  of  development  and \nsophistication. They are dominated by banks, reflecting a lack of capacity in the nonbanking \nsubsectors and capital markets. A non-diversified finance sector represents a risk in terms of \nthe inability to deal with financial shocks and periods of uncertainty. The transformation of the \nnature of financial intermediation by including insurance companies and pension funds could \nprovide  new  mechanisms  for  channeling  savings  to  investments.  These  developments, \naccompanied  by  the  emergence  of  equity  and  debt  markets,  and  financial  products  like \nforwards, futures, and other derivatives instruments, have the capacity to reallocate risks and \nput capital to more efficient use. Insurance can also protect the poor against livelihood risks and \ncatastrophic  loss,  preventing them from falling  back  into cyclical  poverty. It  can  also  help \nmobilize long-term domestic resources to finance investments.  \n3.  The evolution of the insurance subsector has necessitated amendments to international \nregulatory standards, as well as the development of new standards to bridge regulatory gaps \nand  address  emerging  product  lines.  Coping  with  these  challenges,  ensuring  consumer \nconfidence,  and  addressing  the  needs  of  the  poor  present  a  development  challenge  for \ngovernments, regulatory agencies, and their international partners.  IAIS leads the work on \ninternational insurance standards. If developing countries are to benefit from continued growth \nin financial services markets, their perspectives can be reflected through the implementation of \ninternational  insurance standards  and their  periodic  assessment.  Therefore,  as  part  of the \nregion\u2019s  finance  sector  development  and  growth,  greater  priority  needs  to  be  given  to \nstrengthening infrastructure for insurance and private pension institutions by supporting DMC \nefforts to improve macro- and microprudential regulation and supervision policy. This will build \npublic confidence and ensure continued stability and integrity.2 \n4.  While  most  DMCs  have  strengthened  insurance  supervision,  some  unaddressed \nprincipal challenges relate to supervisory capacity constraints, incomplete legal frameworks, \ninability to adequately regulate and supervise financial and mixed-activity conglomerates, and \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 November 2013. \n2  ADB. 2011. Financial Sector Operational Plan. Manila. \n ", "2   \nlack of adoption of international standards at a pace consistent with the country\u2019s financial \ndevelopment and supervisory capacity.3  \n \n5.  The  development  of  a  well-regulated  insurance  system  can  help  attract  foreign \ninvestment  and  result  in  the  development  of  a  sound  insurance  market  by  bringing  in \ninternational experience and best practices. By designing customized products, it will provide an \navenue to enable borrowing against future income, and help rationalize public spending to \nincrease social transfers, reform pension systems, and provide universal health care insurance \nand education. It will also help develop capital markets and enhance access to long-term \nfinance. Regulatory and supervisory frameworks and finance sector policies must support and \nkeep up with market development to avoid creating new sources of financial instability.   \n \n6.  Therefore, developing capacity building initiatives through targeted and well-coordinated \nTA will assist insurance regulators in aligning their regulations with international best practices, \nwhich  is  widely  recognized  as  the  precondition  for  increasing  insurance  penetration  for \ndeveloping sound insurance markets.4  This will be accomplished by introducing a mechanism \nto assess the implementation of international insurance standards, and an objective peer review, \nbased  on  existing  IAIS  methodologies  and  processes.  Adoption  of  multilateral  information \nexchange  arrangements  should  follow,  such  as  the  IAIS  multilateral  memorandum  of \nunderstanding to facilitate exchange of confidential information in the insurance subsector and \npromote financial integration. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA impact will be improved harmonization of national insurance regulatory regimes \nwith international insurance standards through the promotion of cooperation and information \nexchange from the IAIS multilateral memorandum of understanding. The TA outcome will be \neffective implementation of action plans with enhanced observance of the IAIS insurance core \nprinciples (ICPs) and standards. Following each thematic self-assessment and peer review, \nsubmission of at least one action plan to address gaps is expected. \n \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will train insurance supervisors to implement international insurance standards in \na proportionate manner taking into account the state of development of the insurance system in \ntheir countries. It will help develop local capacity by building a cadre of thematic and topic \nexperts who would be able to carry out subsequent training on selected topics. It will assist in \ndeveloping  a  database  of  insurance  statistics  with  the  assistance  of  the  Organisation  for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and contribute to regional integration by \npromoting cooperation and information exchange. \n \n                                                \n3  Financial Stability Board, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank. 2011.

A March 2011 review of International Monetary Fund and World Bank work on standards and codes \nconcluded that the work was useful for countries in identifying gaps, setting the reform agenda, strengthening \ninstitutions, and enhancing transparency. \n4  Joint Ministerial Statement of the 17th ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Finance Ministers\u2019 \nMeeting, 4 April 2013, Bandar Seri Begawan. \n ", "  3 \n9.  The TA will have five outputs. \n(i)  Capacity  building  to  operationalize  a  cadre  of  trainers,  assessors,  and  peer \nreviewers  conducted.  Training  workshops,  seminars,  and  webinars  will  be \nconducted  on  IAIS  ICPs,  standards,  application  guidance,  and  insurance \nstatistics. \n(ii)  Recommendations and action plan arising from self-assessment and peer review \nsubmitted.  These  will  cover  either  the  full  set  of  ICPs  or  thematic  ICPs. \nQuestionnaires  and  tools  will  be  developed  to  assess  legal  aspects  and \nsupervisory practice.5 A peer group comprising topic experts (trained insurance \nsupervisors from Asia and the Pacific) assisted by IAIS topic experts, ADB staff, \nand specialist consultants will review the responses. The peer review team will \nprepare assessment and peer review reports for each respondent jurisdiction on \na confidential basis. Each jurisdiction will be obliged to submit an action plan to \naddress any gaps. The team will prepare a separate aggregate report to analyze \nthe responses, identify trends and gaps, and recommend action for reforms and \nfuture TA. Mechanisms will be developed to support regional associations of \ninsurance supervisors in monitoring progress of the action plans. \n(iii)  DMCs interested in submitting applications to become signatories of the IAIS \nmultilateral memorandum of understanding assisted. Support will be provided for \ncooperation  and  information  exchange  among  supervisors  in  interested \ncountries.6 \n(iv)  A  pan-Asian  database  of  insurance  statistics  developed.  OECD  will  provide \nsupport.7 \n(v)  Self-assessment, peer review, and information exchange exercises evaluated. A \nthird party will evaluate the delivery of activities. \n \n10.  The  TA  will  leverage  partnerships  with  IAIS,  OECD,  and  others  to  promote  best \npractices in the DMCs. IAIS will provide its core curriculum, self-assessment and peer review \nmethodology, and survey tool. It will provide experts to act as trainers and peer reviewers. \n \n11.  The  self-assessments  and  peer reviews  are  voluntary  exercises  and require strong \nsupport from insurance regulators and inputs from IAIS. Risks to the project include political \nsensitivity  in  initiating  national  reforms;  this  could  negatively  influence  reforms  and \nharmonization  due  to  lack  of  commitment  from  regulators.  The  absorptive  capacity  of \nparticipants will be important for TA implementation. \n \n12.  The TA outputs are expected to stimulate other TA projects that assist DMCs in carrying \nout insurance subsector reforms and support sustainable capacity building. They will also help \nto  catalyze  change  by  attracting  more  private  investment  and  deploying  ADB\u2019s  technical \nexpertise to specific transactions. \n \n                                                \n5  This will be developed for those insurance core principles and standards where IAIS tools are not available. \n6  The ability to share information and provide assistance requires a high standard of confidentiality and professional \nsecrecy. The IAIS multilateral memorandum of understanding seeks to establish a formal basis for cooperation \nand  information  exchange  among  the  signatory  jurisdictions  regarding  the  supervision  of  insurance  and \nreinsurance companies and insurance groups where cross-border aspects arise. This includes requesting and \nproviding information on operations of insurance companies supervised by all signatory authorities having a \nlegitimate interest.  \n7  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development will provide the methodology and technical support \nfor developing a pan-Asian database of insurance statistics. \n ", "4   \n13.  Based on the results of the self-assessment and peer review reports, as well as the \naction plans developed, phase 2 of the TA will be considered. Phase 2 would focus capacity \ndevelopment  where  observance  is  weak.  In  consultation  with  the  IAIS  and  the  regional \nassociations of insurance supervisors in Asia and the Pacific, specific topics that require priority \nattention by insurance supervisors in DMCs will be identified, along with the development of \ninsurance statistics expertise. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The cost estimates and financing plan are \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB will be the executing agency, and the Office of Regional Economic Integration \n(OREI) will implement the TA. An OREI staff team will regularly monitor and administer the \nindividual contracts and manage the combined outputs to achieve the TA objectives. The TA is \nexpected to be implemented from January 2014 to December 2016. \n \n16.  Individual international consultants with sound experience in insurance supervision and \nin carrying out assessments of compliance with the IAIS ICPs will be engaged for 18 person-\nmonths. They will work on an intermittent basis on (i) supervisory systems, ICPs 1 and 2 (1.5 \nperson-months); (ii) risk governance, ICPs 4, 5, 7, and 8 (1.5 person-months); (iii) supervisory \nmeasures, ICPs 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 (1.5 person-months); (iv) market conduct, ICPs 18 and 19 \n(1.5 person-months); (v) reinsurance and other forms of risk transfer, ICP 13 (2.5 person-\nmonths); (vi) solvency and solvency-related issues, ICPs 14, 15, 16, 17, and 20 (3 person-\nmonths); (vii) group supervision, ICP 23 (1.5 person-months); (viii) macroprudential surveillance, \nICP 24 (1 person-month); (ix) information exchange and cooperation, ICPs 3, 25, and 26, and \nmultilateral memorandum of understanding (3 person-months); and (x) combating fraud, money \nlaundering, and financing of terrorism, ICPs 21 and 22 (1 person-month). The TA will also \nrequire 54 person-months of inputs from individual national consultants with experience in TA \nadministration.   \n \n17.  About eight resource persons will be invited to participate in seminars and training \ncourses as speakers, discussants, or facilitators for a total of 1.1 person-months.  \n \n18.  ADB will recruit the consultants on an individual basis in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference \nfor the consultants are in Appendix 3. Disbursement under the TA will be done in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). ADB will engage a team of individual consultants rather than a firm as this will facilitate: (i) \nfaster mobilization  of consultants, (ii) greater ADB  staff  control  in  selecting  and managing \nindividual consultants, and (iii) greater flexibility in engaging experts specializing in international \nregulatory best practices on insurance.  \n \n19.  To maximize the participation of insurance supervisors, subregional thematic seminars \non ICP topics are planned, followed by self-assessment using IAIS methodology and tools. The \nresponses will be consolidated and self-assessment and peer reports prepared remotely with \nthe help of teams comprising the international consultant for each theme, research assistant at \nADB headquarters, IAIS topic expert(s), ADB expert, two DMC experts (selected after training), \n ", "  5 \nand ADB and OREI staff. Selection of the seminar venue will consider proximity to target \nparticipants. Each subregion will be represented by an Asian Development Fund country.8 \nFurthermore, good  practice  and  lessons  will  be  disseminated  through  policy  dialogue  with \ninsurance supervisors, IAIS, and OECD through regional seminars, and the development of \ntraining materials and knowledge products published under the TA. The consolidated draft \nreports will be shared  with participating countries for review before they are finalized and \npublished.  \n \n18.  IAIS  has  agreed  to  partner  with  ADB  by  developing  a  joint  program  to  promote \nobservance of IAIS ICPs and standards in Asia and the Pacific; by providing the IAIS core \ncurriculum material, methodology, questionnaire, and tools to carry out self-assessments and \npeer  review;  and  by  providing  limited resource  and  expert  support.9 The  Asian  Forum for \nInsurance  Regulators,  the  ASEAN  (Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations)  Insurance \nRegulators Meeting, and the Pacific Inclusion Working Group have agreed to facilitate and \ncoordinate  such  efforts.10 OECD  will  provide  the  methodology  and  technical  support  for \ndeveloping a pan-Asian database of insurance statistics. Such commitment of support will be \nincluded in a memorandum of understanding with each partner once the TA is approved. \n \n19.  ADB  will  consult  with  the  chairs  of  the  Asian  Forum for Insurance Regulators,  the \nASEAN  Insurance  Regulators  Meeting,  the  Pacific  Inclusion Working  Group,  and  the  IAIS \nImplementation Committee, which have agreed to facilitate and coordinate regional activities \nand report on progress. In addition, feedback will be collected at the conclusion of each seminar \nand workshop.  \n \n20.  An end-of-project evaluation will be conducted by a third party 3 months before the \nproject ends using funds retained for this purpose. The evaluation report will form part of the \nproject completion report and will justify funding of a second phase. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor  Thematic  Self-Assessment  and  Peer  Review  of  International  Association  of  Insurance \nSupervisors Insurance Core Principles and Standards for Asia and the Pacific (Phase 1), and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n                                                \n8  The TA will invite developing member countries that are classified as either Group A or B according to the \nOperations Manual, section A1.  Group A countries are Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Kyrgyz Republic, \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Myanmar, Nauru, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, \nTajikistan, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.
