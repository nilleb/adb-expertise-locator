During the 2007 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) requested that the ADB provide \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  Rural  Finance  Development  and  Supervision.  A  Fact-Finding \nMission  visited  Beijing  and  Shenyang  in  20\u201327  May  2008.  Following  the  discussions,  an \nunderstanding  was  reached  on  the  objectives,  scope,  terms  of  reference,  cost  estimates, \nfinancing  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  TA.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.   ISSUES \n \n2.  Poverty  and  inequity  remain  important  development  issues  in  the  PRC  despite  its \nimpressive economic growth and remarkable progress in poverty reduction over the past 3 \ndecades. Most of the country\u2019s poor are concentrated in rural areas. Significant socioeconomic \ndisparities have also emerged between the urban and rural sectors, and within the rural sector. \nPolicymakers\u2019 concern about these trends is reflected in the PRC\u2019s 11th Five-Year Plan, which \nhighlights the need to address rural poverty to achieve equitable development and reduce \nurban\u2013rural disparities. \n \n3.  The Government has recognized that a multipronged approach is essential to address \nrural poverty and equity issues. The importance of improving financial services for the rural \npopulation, including low-income people, has been identified. This recognition of the role of rural \nfinancial markets in effecting economic growth, poverty reduction, and the creation of a more \nequitable society is particularly significant for several reasons. First, estimates of both the \nPeople\u2019s Bank of China (PBC) and the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) suggest \nthat only one-third of the more than 750 million people living in rural areas has access to formal \ncredit services and that a significant proportion of those without access to credit services have \nan  unmet  demand  for  it.  Second,  increased  access  to  improved  financial services  for  the \nmajority of the rural population can contribute significantly in increasing rural economic growth \nand  reducing  poverty.  Third,  such  access  can  also  contribute  to  reducing  socioeconomic \ninequities within rural areas and between the urban and rural sectors. Fourth, the lack of broad \naccess to financial services could have significant adverse economic and social consequences \nif the PRC\u2019s high overall levels of economic growth were to slow. Rural nonfarm enterprises, \nwhich require more access to better quality financial services, would particularly likely suffer and \ntheir  ability  to  generate  better  incomes  and  more  productive  employment  opportunities  for \nothers could be diminished. \n \n4.  There are efforts to develop rural financial markets, introduced under the 11th Five-Year \nPlan. One such initiative is the reform of rural credit cooperatives (RCCs). The RCC system has \nsuffered  from  uncertainty  in  the  ownership  structure  and  conflicts  between  policy  and \ncommercial orientations. In the past, there was an apparent conflict of interest in having the \nPBC serve as both the supervisor and administrator2 of the rural credit cooperatives system.3 \nThe lack of a proper regulatory framework for other types of rural finance organizations, such as \nmicrofinance institutions, had become a major impediment to the emergence of alternatives to \nthe rural credit cooperatives system. As a consequence, CBRC expanded the policy and legal \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 1 August 2008. \n2  Representing interests of owners.  \n3  The establishment of the CBRC as the separate banking regulator in mid-2003 and the RCC system reform policy \nadopted that year was aimed, among other things, at eliminating such conflicts of interest.  ", "2     \nframework to enable new institutional modalities to flourish in rural financial markets, including \ntown  and  village  banks,  and  community  credit  cooperatives.  These  new  modalities  have \nexpanded the potential of the private sector to invest and participate in formal rural financial \nmarkets. Despite these initiatives, the Government is aware that accelerating the development \nof competitive rural financial markets requires further systematic public support. The pressure is \nmounting on policymakers to expand such support through a range of fiscal measures. The \nGovernment is therefore looking into a broader set of measures to develop rural financial \nmarkets.  \n \n5.  Public Policy and Financial Support. The PRC has a long history of substantial public \nsupport for rural finance. A large amount of this support has been provided to reform and \nrestructure the existing rural finance institutional network and to finance rural lending operations. \nHowever, the current status of rural financial markets tends to suggest that such support has not \ngenerated significant positive and sustainable results. A major drawback of past measures was \nthat these did not remove the need for further public support over the long term and had not \nencouraged improved institutional behavior. Public support often involved writing-off loan losses \nand meeting other expenses, which created moral hazard problems, distorted market behavior, \nand undermined the financial viability of service providers.4  \n \n6.  CBRC, in principle, supports the adoption of a more effective and sustainable public \nsupport  strategy  to  develop  rural  financial  markets  through  both  supply-  and  demand-side \ninterventions. There are two major objectives for such public support: (i) restructuring existing \nrural finance institutions to enhance their sustainability, and (ii) improving access to finance in \nareas where financial services have been proven to be commercially unsustainable in the short \nand medium terms. How such public support should be provided to promote competitive rural \nfinancial markets to maximize economic and social benefits, while minimizing distortions in the \nmarket, is a key element of the proposed strategy. CBRC recognizes that many effective \nsupporting policies have been adopted in both developed and developing countries and it \nrequires assistance to better understand how these policies have been conceived, formulated, \nimplemented, and evaluated in various contexts; and what lessons can be drawn to arrive at \nmore effective policies for the development of rural financial markets in the PRC.  \n \n7.  Regulatory  and  Supervisory  System.  The  Government  seeks  to  improve  the \nregulatory  system  to  strengthen  trends  supporting  the  establishment  of  sustainable  rural \nfinancial markets within the diverse market structure expected to emerge as a result of recent \nreform measures. The creation of CBRC and the transfer of the responsibility for regulation and \nsupervision of rural financial institutions, including rural credit cooperatives, from PBC to it was \none such measure. CBRC has also taken a number of measures to improve its capacity to \neffectively regulate and supervise rural financial institutions. These include introduction of risk-\nbased  asset  classifications,  and  differentiated  supervisory  management  for  rural  financial \ninstitutions based on risk and compliance ratings. However, rural finance, and rural credit in \nparticular, has its own characteristics, and specific regulatory practices need to be appropriately \ndesigned and implemented. CBRC is cognizant of this need. Characteristics of rural finance in \nthe PRC include: (i) strong seasonality with annual and perennial agriculture production patterns, \nand vulnerability to natural disasters that may warrant a more flexible, risk-based categorization \nof assets; (ii) varied ownership and capital structure of rural financial institutions, such as credit \ncooperatives and lending-only institutions, which have different capital adequacy requirements \nand taxation treatment; (iii) new types of rural financial institutions, such as town and village \n                                                 \n4  RCCs have gone through several rounds of ineffective restructurings in the past 10\u201315 years. The \u201cmoral hazard\u201d \ncomes from the expectation that public support will continue, which undermines the incentive for reform. ", "    3   \nbanks,  and  community  credit  cooperatives  that  need  more  adaptive  regulatory  norms  and \nsupervisory treatment; and (iv) adoption of new approaches and technologies by rural financial \ninstitutions aimed at lowering operational costs and deepening outreach, such as cellphone \nbanking and the use of banking agents, which also require targeted regulatory and supervisory \ntreatment.  \n \n8.  A primary thrust of ADB assistance under the country partnership strategy (CPS)5 \ncompleted in 2008 is to support inclusive growth and balanced development. ADB\u2019s indicative \nareas for interventions, as stipulated by the financial sector plan under the CPS, comprise of \nbuilding an inclusive, market-oriented, rural finance system; supporting policy and regulatory \nreform; and strengthening financial supervision and coordination among financial regulators in \nrural  finance.  ADB  has  previously  provided  TA  to  the  PRC  to  strengthen  the  regulatory \nframework of the financial system, and to improve access to finance by rural residents. These \ninclude, among other forms of assistance, two TAs to strengthen CBRC\u2019s supervisory capacity6 \nand a TA to support the reform of rural credit cooperatives and the development of microfinance \ninstitutions.7\n \n9.    CBRC needs to ensure that its regulatory practices facilitate sustainable growth \nof  rural  financial  services.  Regulatory  practices  need  to  be  designed  to  support  outreach \nobjectives, but not at the expense of the stability and quality of rural financial services. A proper \nbalance needs to be maintained between supportive regulatory practices and a healthy and \nstable  rural  financial  system.  Hence,  CBRC  wants  to  review  the  regulatory  policies  and \npractices relating to successful rural financial operations around the world and ensure that their \napplication would be consistent with the diverse rural financial markets in the PRC that are \nbeginning to emerge and are likely to grow in size and scope in the medium term.  Being chair \nof the Government\u2019s inter-agency rural finance development working group, CBRC requires \nassistance  to  understand,  in  a  systematic  way,  how  these  policies  have  been  conceived, \nformulated, implemented, and evaluated. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA will result in increased access to financial services for a larger proportion of the \nrural  population  that  is  currently  underserved  or  un-served  by  rural  financial  markets.  Its  \noutcome will be improved policy formulation, institutional coordination, and regulation in rural \nfinancial  markets  with  sufficient  outreach  in  both  the  depth  and  breadth  of  rural  financial \nservices. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will examine the following issues in rural financial markets development: \n \n(i)  Role  of  public  policy  and  financial  support.  The  TA  will  conduct  a \nsocioeconomic  impact  analysis  of  past  measures  of  public  support  for  rural \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008.

Among the public support policies \nthat  would  be  considered  are  effective  targeting,  time-boundness,  and \nperformance-based allocation and implementation. \n(ii)  Need for adaptive regulatory framework. The TA will examine current legal \nand regulatory policies and practices for rural credit operations at the central and \nlocal levels; identify salient features of the operations of rural financial institutions \nas compared to other financial institutions; provide recommendations on how to \nstrike  a  balance  among  (a)  adequate  financial  services  in  rural  areas,  (b) \nencouraging innovation to facilitate sustainable rural finance outreach, and (c) \nfinancial  soundness  of  rural  financial  institutions;  and  identify  the  capacity-\nbuilding  support  needs  of  CBRC  (at  the  provincial  level)  and  of  rural  credit \ncooperatives to implement improved legal and regulatory policies and practices. \n \n12.  The TA will generate the following outputs: \n  \n(i)  Output 1. The TA will produce a socioeconomic analysis of past public support \nmeasures in the PRC and an examination of how public support measures have \nbeen used in developed countries. This output will provide lessons for designing \nan effective public policy support program and lead to a set of recommendations \nin the form of a series of policy notes for high-level decision makers for an \neffective  public  support  policy  for  rural  financial  markets  development.  The \nrecommendations will highlight (a) what type of support should be considered; (b) \nhow public support can be designed in an incentive-compatible manner; (c) how \npublic  support  programs  may  be  effectively  implemented  to  ensure  their \nexpected outcomes; and (d) what public support audit and evaluation program \nneed to be put in place to ensure transparency, fiscal integrity, effectiveness, and \nimpact. \n(ii)  Output 2. The TA will likewise examine regulatory practices and give a set of \nspecific recommendations that would promote the sustainable outreach of rural \nfinancial services, in general, and expand those services to low-income groups \nand their micro- and small-enterprises, in particular. International experience and \nlessons learned will be used in the formulation of these practices. \n(iii)  Output 3. The third set of outputs from the TA will consist of reports and policy \nnotes that will allow high-level decision makers, the staff of CBRC\u2019s head and \nlocal-level offices, and other concerned agencies to gain a deeper understanding \nof how public policies can be formulated and implemented in a market-friendly \nmanner  without  undermining  the  sustainable  development  of  rural  financial \nmarkets.  In  addition,  better-designed  curriculums  for  capacity  building  and ", "    5   \nknowledge  transfer  will  allow  local-level  CBRC  staff  to  identify  sustainable, \noutreach-oriented, regulatory practices. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000 equivalent. The Government has requested ADB \nto finance $400,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding \nprogram. The Government will finance the balance of the cost, equivalent to $150,000, through \nthe  provision  of  office  accommodation,  counterpart  staff,  transportation,  and  other  related \nservices. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  CBRC will be the Executing Agency (EA) and the Cooperative Finance Supervision \nDepartment of CBRC will be the responsible department. A coordination group will be set up, \ncomprised of senior officials of the relevant government and regulatory agencies, to provide \noverall  guidance  for  project  implementation.  The  EA  will  provide  the  consultants  with  the \nnecessary office space, counterpart staff, transportation, and other services, and will arrange \nmeeting appointments for the consultants with relevant agencies and organizations.  \n \n15.  The TA will engage two international consultants and two national consultants for a total \nof 10 person-months. The two international consultants will be the team leader and international \nrural finance development specialist (2.5 person-months), and an international rural finance \nregulation  and  supervision  specialist  (1.5  person-months).  They  will  be  supported  by \ncorresponding  national  consultants.  There  will  be  a  separate  budget  to  engage  additional \ninternational  and  domestic  Resource  Persons  for  specific  technical  areas  during  TA \nimplementation,  as  the  need  arises.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  are  in \nAppendix 3. The international and national consultants will be selected and engaged on an \nindividual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  Equipment  will  be  procured  by  the  EA  in  accordance  with \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Disbursements under the TA will be conducted in line with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time). \nFor equipment, training seminars, and conferences, an advance payment facility could be used. \n \n16.  The  TA  is  expected  to  begin  in  January  2009  and  end  in  December  2009.  The \nconsultants will submit the following to both ADB and the EA: (i) inception reports 2 weeks after \nthe commencement of their services, (ii) interim progress reports at appropriate stages during \nTA implementation, (iii) draft final reports before the conclusion of the contract, and (iv) final \nreports 2 weeks after receiving comments from the EA and ADB. All reports must be submitted \nin English, and the draft final report and the final report should also be submitted in Chinese. \nWorkshops will be organized periodically to disseminate the consultants\u2019 findings and to discuss \npolicy recommendations. \n \nIV.
