INTRODUCTION \n1.  Social protection is the third pillar of the inclusive growth agenda of Strategy 2020, the \nlong-term strategic framework of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). A midterm review of \nStrategy 2020 in 2014 reconfirmed social protection as an important instrument for achieving \ninclusive growth in Asia and the Pacific.1 ADB\u2019s Social Protection Operational Plan (SPOP), \n2014\u20132020  aims  to  align  and  operationalize  ADB\u2019s  Social  Protection  Strategy  (2001)  with \nStrategy 2020.2 The SPOP supports knowledge solutions to strengthen and expand social \nprotection  programs  in  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).  ADB\u2019s  corporate  results \nframework has adopted the social protection index (SPI) as one of its measures of inclusive \ngrowth.3 The SPI is also an outcome indicator in the SPOP.  \n \n2.  The technical assistance (TA) will support the implementation of the SPOP by building \nthe  capacity  of  DMCs  to  improve  their  delivery  of  social  protection  programs  through \nassessment and monitoring that makes use of the SPI. It will also build statistical capacity to \nbetter measure and monitor expenditures on social protection.4 Based on consultations with \nADB operations departments, the project will select DMCs where social protection programs will \nbe monitored and technical support will be provided to integrate social protection modules into \nhousehold-level  national  surveys.5 A  similar  activity  was  piloted  in  2010\u20132012  under  ADB \ntechnical assistance for updating and improving the social protection index in Indonesia, the \nPhilippines, and Sri Lanka.6 The new TA will be implemented in collaboration with International \nLabor Organization (ILO) and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development \n(OECD).7 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Since early 2000, social protection has played an increasingly significant role in efforts to \npromote inclusive growth and help reduce poverty, inequality, and vulnerability in Asia and the \nPacific. ADB defines social protection as a set of policies and programs designed to reduce \npoverty and vulnerability by promoting efficient labor markets, diminishing people\u2019s exposure to \nrisks, and enhancing their capacity to protect themselves against hazards and interruption or \nloss of income.8 The need to expand social protection has been a central topic in national, \nregional, and global discourse on how to ensure income security for the poor and vulnerable \npopulations  amid  social,  demographic,  environmental,  and  economic  challenges.  Many  of \nADB\u2019s DMCs have expanded their social protection programs and developed national social \nprotection strategies.9 The United Nations High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-\n2015 Development Agenda noted in its 2013 report that this step has been taken by many \ncountries across the world to address income inequality by improving the lives of the poor, and \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n3  The work on the SPI was pioneered by ADB in 2005 and first updated in 2009 using a revised methodology.  \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 May 2014. \n5  The social protection module contains a set of questions on social protection expenditures and beneficiaries. \n6  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Updating and Improving the Social Protection Index. Manila. \n7  A letter of agreement between ADB, the ILO, and the OECD to support the preparation of the SPI was signed in \n2009. The letter of agreement will be extended under this TA to support the second update of the SPI. Under this \nagreement, the ILO and the OECD will be involved as peer reviewers and resource persons at their own costs. \n8  ADB. 2001. Social Protection Strategy. Manila.  \n9  The DMCs that have established national social protection strategies are Cambodia (2011), Indonesia (2006), the \nKyrgyz Republic (2011), Pakistan (2007), the Philippines (2009), Uzbekistan (2013), and Viet Nam (2010). \n ", "2   \nthat they have worked at the same time to transform their economies so that growth is sustained \nover the long term and provides more decent jobs and secure livelihoods.10 Social protection \nprograms can reduce poverty and develop human capital.  \n \n4.  While many DMCs have their programs, most lack the capacity to implement them \neffectively and to properly monitor and measure the program impacts on target beneficiaries. \nDMC investment in social protection has generally remained low, even as macroeconomic \nperformance in much of the region has been strong. The results of ADB\u2019s work on the SPI, \nwhich  analyzed  public  social  protection  expenditures  in  2009  showed  that  most  DMCs\u2014\nparticularly those that have graduated to middle-income status\u2014have not expanded their social \nprotection systems  at  a  rate  commensurate  with  their  overall  economic growth.11 The  SPI \ncaptures the breadth of social protection programs (i.e., the extent of coverage) and the depth \n(the size of benefits), as well as their impacts on gender equity and poverty reduction. It shows \nthat social protection coverage and benefits in the region remain inadequate.  \n \n5.  Women generally benefit less than men do from social protection programs, particularly \nsocial insurance and labor market programs. However, conditional cash transfer programs in \nsome DMCs, such as the Benazir Income Support Program in Pakistan and the Pantawid \nPamilyang Pilipino Program in the Philippines, have targeted women and girls specifically to \nimprove gender equality in access and opportunities. This has shown that social protection \nprograms\u2014cash transfers programs, in particular\u2014can help provide basic income security for \nwomen.  \n \n6.  The SPI has become one of ADB\u2019s pioneering knowledge products, and its utility has \nbeen  recognized  by  governments,  researchers,  and  the  media.  As  indicated  in  the  2013 \nregional report on the SPI, many segments of a country\u2019s population need social protection at \nsome point in their lives, whether this is due to unemployment, sickness, disability, or the \ndevastation  on  livelihoods  inflicted  by  natural  disasters  (footnote  11).  The  effective  policy \nresponse to each of these problems could well be different. Empirical data captured through the \nSPI  estimates  can  therefore  aid  policy  makers  and  other  stakeholders  in  developing  and \nstrengthening  national  social  protection  systems.  Furthermore,  many  vulnerable  groups, \nincluding women and workers in the informal sector, cannot access unemployment, health, or \nother forms of social insurance but are not poor enough to be eligible for such social assistance \nas cash transfers. Government social protection programs need to be expanded to cover this \n\u2018missing middle,\u2019 who are at risk of falling into poverty when microeconomic shocks and/or \nmacroeconomic events adversely impact their lives. \n \n7.  Within ADB, social protection has been recognized as a pillar for achieving inclusive \ngrowth. ADB support to help DMCs strengthen social protection programs, strategies, and \nsystems has been laid out in the SPOP. Under the SPOP, ADB will continue its work on the SPI, \nwhich has received strong support within and outside of ADB, to help DMCs assess and monitor \nsocial  protection  programs  and  investments.  A  2012  special  evaluation  study  on  social \nprotection by ADB\u2019s Independent Evaluation Department found the SPI to be highly relevant in \n                                                \n10 United  Nations.  2013.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be improved monitoring of social protection programs for the \npoor and vulnerable in Asia and the Pacific. The outcome will be increased DMC capacities to \nassess, monitor, and report on the expenditures, coverage, and gender and poverty impacts of \nnational social protection programs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will have three outputs: (i) the updating of SPI and country assessments of \nsocial protection programs for 2011\u20132013; (ii) the development of capacity in national statistical \noffices for monitoring and assessing social protection; and (iii) the sharing and dissemination of \nknowledge on social protection programs and best practices. The country assessments that will \nform part of the first output will provide data analysis and policy and program recommendations. \nThe outputs will reinforce one another to build DMC capacity to collect data on social protection \nprograms and their impacts. Through the TA and by directly engaging with governments, ADB \nhopes to foster their greater use and ownership of the SPI.  \n \n10.  Output 1: Social protection index and country assessments of social protection \nprograms updated. The project will update SPI data for 2011\u20132013 for 41 countries, subject to \nthe concurrence of the DMCs. This will include 35 countries that participated in a 2009 SPI \nupdate and six other DMCs.14 Following an approach similar to that taken by the previous ADB \nTA for updating and improving the social protection index (footnote 6), the project will tap \nnational researchers to gather data and undertake the preliminary analysis at the country level, \nworking in collaboration with the national statistical office and in consultation  with relevant \nministries.15 To ensure consistency of estimates across the DMCs, international consultants will \nbe recruited to prepare the regional report and assist national consultants.  \n \n11.  Output  2:  Capacity  developed  in  national  government  agencies  for  social \nprotection  monitoring  and  assessment.  This  TA  will  develop  statistical  capacity  for \nmonitoring social protection in selected DMCs. The TA will build on achievements under the TA \nfor updating and improving the social protection index (footnote 6), which developed the social \n                                                \n12 ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n13 The database was a collaborative effort of three ADB departments: the Office of Information, Systems, and \nTechnology;  the  Economics  and  Research  Department;  and  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment. It can be accessed at ADB Social Protection Index. http://spi.adb.org/spidmz/index.jsp  \n14 Government agreement to participate in the TA will be sought during TA preparation for all participating countries \nduring implementation after TA approval. The 35 countries covered by the 2009 SPI update were Afghanistan, \nArmenia,  Azerbaijan,  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Cambodia,  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  Fiji,  Georgia,  India, \nIndonesia, Japan, the Republic of Korea, the Kyrgyz Republic, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \nthe Maldives, the Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Nauru, Nepal, Pakistan, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, \nSamoa, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, and Viet \nNam. The additional six DMCs will be the Cook Islands, Kazakhstan, the Federated States of Micronesia, \nMyanmar, Tonga, and Turkmenistan. \n15 An ongoing data update is partly financed by ADB. 2010.

Completion of the country SPI reports, \nincluding syntheses and analyses, will be supported by the TA. \n ", "4   \nprotection module incorporated in household income and expenditure surveys that was piloted \nin Indonesia, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka. Lessons learned from and best practices adopted \nin these earlier capacity-building activities will be tailored for use in the development of social \nprotection programs in the second set of DMCs selected to participate in the statistical capacity \nbuilding under this TA to help strengthen self-reporting and monitoring of social protection \nprograms. The TA will help at least three national statistics offices in the selected DMCs to \nincorporate the social protection module into a nationwide household survey that is conducted \nregularly and from which poverty incidence can be estimated.16 The criteria for selecting the \nparticipating DMCs, which will be done in close consultation with ADB\u2019s operations departments, \nwill include a DMC\u2019s willingness to institutionalize the social protection module in regularly \nconducted  nationwide  household  surveys  and  to  provide  counterpart focal  persons for the \nexercise.  The  national  statistical  offices  will  be  responsible  for  determining  which  social \nprotection programs will be covered in the surveys\u2019 social protection modules, developing the \nanalytical framework, and drafting and disseminating the survey report. \n \n12.  Output 3: Knowledge of social protection programs and best practices shared and \ndisseminated. The TA will support regional and country-level consultation and policy dialogues \nto engage stakeholders in DMCs and further disseminate the findings of the knowledge work \nbased on the SPI. These knowledge events will also serve as venues for DMC capacity building \nthrough the sharing of best practices and policy discussions between ADB and DMCs as part of \nSouth\u2013South cooperation and learning on social protection. DMC officials from national planning \ncommissions and ministries of welfare, social policy, labor, and employment will be invited, \nalong with national researchers responsible for data collection to discuss initial findings and \nincrease  the  awareness  of  policy  makers  on  the  utility  of  monitoring  social  protection \nexpenditures and measuring impact. At least one regional workshop and three country-level \npolicy dialogues will be organized early in the TA implementation, and a final workshop will be \norganized to disseminate the findings of the country studies. All outputs of the TA will be further \nshared with stakeholders through print, knowledge events, and online through the ADB website \nand social media. The TA will support the publication of the updated regional SPI report, and \npolicy briefs on the major program categories of social protection. The country assessments will \nbe uploaded in the ADB website as final TA consultant reports. Data used in generating the SPI \nwill be shared in the SPI database online under ADB\u2019s Statistical Database System. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 2.5 years from June 2014 to December 2016. ADB, \nthrough its Regional and Sustainable Development Department, will be the executing agency \nand  will  work  closely  with  regional  departments  during  implementation  of  country-specific \nactivities. The Regional and Sustainable Development Department will undertake the overall \nadministrative, advisory, and coordinating role for the TA. ADB staff members will serve as \n                                                \n16 Mongolia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam are countries that have expressed interest in TA support for statistical capacity \nbuilding. Government concurrence will be sought before TA implementation, and no activities under the TA will \nstart or be financed until a no-objection in writing has been obtained from the DMC. The Poverty Reduction, Social \nDevelopment and Governance Division of the  Regional and Sustainable Development Department  and the \nDevelopment Indicators and Policy Research Division of the Economics and Research Department will collaborate \non the statistical-capacity-building activities, particularly the updating of the SPI database. \n ", "  5 \nresource  persons  in  capacity-building  workshops  and  provide  administrative  or  secretariat \nsupport services for the implementation of regional training activities. Relevant ministries in \nMongolia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam will serve as knowledge partners for the statistical capacity-\nbuilding component activities aimed at including social protection modules in national household \nincome and expenditure surveys.17 Building on the partnership established under the preceding \nTA for updating and improving the social protection index (footnote 6), this TA will also be \nimplemented in collaboration with the ILO and the OECD, as partner centers of excellence, \nwhich will provide additional technical expertise for the statistical capacity building and the \nrefinement of the SPI methodology and estimates (footnote 7). \n \n15.  ADB will hire consultants in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). To avoid delays in TA implementation, the TA may use \neither individual consultants or a firm for the update of the SPI, depending on the availability of \nthe necessary experts. ADB\u2019s Operations Services and Financial Management Department will \nbe consulted during consultant recruitment. The project requires a total of 7.5 person-months of \ninternational consulting services and 81.5 person-months of national consulting services. The \nteam  will  consist  of (i)  two  international  consultants  with  expertise  in  the  SPI;  and  (ii)  an \nestimated 43 national consultants, comprising 41 who will work directly on the calculation of SPI \nestimates for 41 countries, and 2 consultants who will support the consolidation of the SPI at the \nregional  level,  as  well  as  the  capacity-building  workshops  and  knowledge  dissemination. \nBecause the TA requires a distinctive combination of national experts with expertise on social \nprotection and capacity to generate estimates for the SPI, it is deemed necessary to be flexible \nin recruitment during TA implementation. The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. \n \n16.  In-kind government  inputs  are  expected  to  be  in  the form  of  information  provision, \ncollaboration on the inclusion of social protection modules in relevant national surveys for at \nleast three selected DMCs, and participation in national and regional meetings. The TA budget \nwill also support knowledge creation and sharing for other DMCs at the regional level and \npublication  and  dissemination  activities.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $750,000 on a grant basis for \nAssessing and Monitoring Social Protection Programs in Asia and the Pacific, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n \n                                                \n17 Relevant ministries include the national statistics offices and ministries of economic planning, finance, and labor \nand social welfare.
