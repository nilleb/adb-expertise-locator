Developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) recognize \nthe need for strengthened social and environmental safeguard systems. Consultations in the \ncontext  of  the  middle  income  and  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  country  partnership \nframework1 and the innovation and efficiency initiative (IEI)2 have highlighted the need to \nincrease  country  ownership  and  capacity  in  delivering  safeguard  outcomes,  and  to  adopt \nsafeguard  procedures  that  reflect  the  varying  capacities  of  DMCs.  Ongoing  multilateral \ndevelopment bank harmonization efforts3 encourage development partners to harmonize their \npractices and procedures around more effective country safeguard systems. As part of ADB\u2019s \nongoing reform agenda and renewed commitment to improving development effectiveness, a \nsafeguard policy update is being undertaken to ensure that ADB safeguard policies remain \nrelevant to changing client needs and to new lending modalities and instruments. The update \nwill explore several areas to strengthen implementation of the policies, including the possible \napplication of country safeguard systems where relevant safeguard frameworks and capacities \nexist.  \n \n2.  The  scope  and  direction  of  the  proposed  ADB  technical  assistance  (TA)  grant  for \nStrengthening Country Safeguard Systems were defined in the concept paper approved by ADB \nManagement on 18 April 2005. The TA is included in the 2005 TA program of the Regional and \nSustainable Development Department. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Safeguard policies are generally understood to be operational policies that seek to avoid, \nminimize,  or  mitigate  adverse  environmental  impacts,  social  costs  to  third  parties,  or \nmarginalization of vulnerable groups that may result from development projects. Aside from the \n\u201cdo no harm\u201d principle, safeguard policies are intended to improve the quality and effectiveness \nof  projects,  and  thus  ensure  sustainable  economic  development.  Although  ADB  has  had \nenvironment assessment requirements for more than 20 years, its current safeguard policy \nframework  consists  of  three  operational  policies:  Environment  Policy  (2002),  Policy  on \nIndigenous  Peoples  (1998),  and  Policy  on  Involuntary  Resettlement  (1995).  These  have \nOperations Manual (OM) sections (F1, F2, F3) and guidelines (Guidelines on Environment \nAssessment [2003], Handbook on Resettlement, and the forthcoming Handbook on Indigenous \nPeoples Policy).  \n \n4.  To ensure sustainable development activities, DMCs have adopted safeguard policies, \nand regulatory and administrative frameworks in varying degrees. The development of country \nsafeguard frameworks is still evolving. It requires substantial technical support and guidance in \nadopting international best practices and in reaching all sectors and activities. In addition, \nDMCs\u2019  capabilities  in  developing,  applying,  and  implementing  safeguard  systems  vary \nconsiderably. In countries that have limited resources and institutional capacities, the structured \ndevelopment of national safeguard policies and institutional mechanisms requires significant \npolicy adjustments, followed by institutional and administrative frameworks that enhance the \nawareness, understanding, and enforcement of the safeguards. An example of the initiation of \n                                                 \n1  ADB is conducting a strategic exercise, Enhancing Partnership Framework with Middle Income and Ordinary \nCapital Resources Countries, which proposes adopting a new business model to maximize the relevance and \neffectiveness of OCR operations. \n2  The innovation and efficiency initiative (IEI), a special reform mandate launched in late 2003, aims to modernize \nADB\u2019s business model and is a core initiative of ADB\u2019s reform agenda. \n3  Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. Paris High Level Forum, 28 February\u20132 March 2005. \n ", "2   \nthat process has been demonstrated in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, which had to \nundertake an adjustment process associated with safeguards that addresses, among others, \nthe country\u2019s complex interplay of fragile ecosystems, diverse ethnic groups, and largely state- \nand community-vested property rights.4  \n \n5.  In the large DMCs, the need for effective safeguard systems is even more pressing, \ngiven the widely varying environmental conditions, cultural diversity, and legal and institutional \ncomplexities. Some of those countries, such as India and the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nhave made significant progress in setting up safeguard systems that are generally consistent \nwith international best practices. In India, safeguard policies include well-defined environmental \nassessment procedures, national and state land acquisition and compensation frameworks, and \ntribal and scheduled-caste development programs. Indian state and national agencies have also \nconcomitantly developed capacities to apply the safeguards; the National Highways Authority \nand Power Grid Corporation, for example, have set up social and environmental divisions that \ncover all investment activities. The PRC has paid considerable attention to developing state and \nprovincial capabilities in applying safeguard policies, especially in highway projects, in which the \nDepartment of Communications has clearly applied the State Environment Protection Agency\u2019s \nguidelines. However, even in those larger economies, safeguard systems need to be applied \nmore  effectively  across  all  sectors.  This  requires  a  closer  understanding  of  gaps  and \ninconsistencies in investment activities financed by external agencies, which are required to \napply their own safeguard policies.  \n \n6.  In consultations and feedback from operational activities, DMCs have indicated that \nalthough  ADB\u2019s  safeguard  objectives  and  principles  are  generally  acceptable,  the  desired \noutcomes could be achieved by relying on their own country safeguard systems rather than on \nADB  procedures,  which  in  being  applied  uniformly  across  sectors  and  projects,  do  not \nadequately distinguish among the various frameworks, implementation capacities, and track \nrecord in different DMCs. DMCs consider that applying safeguard systems based on country-\nspecific frameworks will reduce transaction costs in project processing and implementation. It \nwill also enable them to build institutional capacity and responsiveness to external financing \nrequirements across sectors, and at the national and subnational levels. The basic rationale for \nadopting country systems includes (i) scaling up development impact beyond the confines of the \nindividual  \u201cring-fenced\u201d  project,  (ii)  increasing  country  ownership  and  sustainability,  (iii) \nfacilitating harmonization, and (iv) simplifying and reducing transaction costs.  \n \n7.  The application of country systems involves greater dependence on a country\u2019s existing \npolicies and practices when those are equivalent in intent, spirit, and content to ADB\u2019s policies.5 \nADB\u2019s policies do not explicitly refer to the use of country safeguard systems, but efforts are \nmade during project processing to ensure general consistency between the policy applications \n(resettlement plans, indigenous peoples development plans, environment management plans) \nand the laws, policies, procedures, and practices of the country where the project is located. \nNonetheless, a more detailed assessment of country situations and institutional capabilities in \ndeveloping and enforcing safeguard provisions is required to determine the usefulness, extent, \nand practicality of applying a country systems approach. Agreement on the approach and \napplicability  of  country  systems  needs  an  analysis  of  (i)  the  degree  of  commonality \n                                                 \n4  The process was supported under Loan 1867-LAO (ADB. 2001. Report and Recommendation of the President to \nthe Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for the Environment and \nSocial Program. Manila [$20 million, approved 6 December]). \n5  Country systems may be considered as those laws, policies, regulations, and administrative structures that are \nused in a particular country for application to an ADB-financed development activity, and have been determined to \nhave provisions similar to those specified in ADB policies and procedures.  \n ", "  3\n(\u201cequivalence\u201d) between country safeguard systems and ADB safeguard policies; and (ii) a \nDMC\u2019s  capacity  (\u201cacceptability\u201d)  to  implement  country  safeguard  systems,  in  terms  of \nimplementation practices, track record, and the capacity of relevant national, subnational, and \nsector institutions.  \n \n8.  The need to harmonize safeguard practices not only between ADB and its DMCs, but \nalso across multilateral financial institutions is central to examining a country systems approach. \nHence,  ADB  and  its  development  partners  will  need  to  coordinate  closely  to  ensure  that \napproaches are consistent. This will avoid the possibility of multiple and varying practices in \napplying country safeguard systems.6 Collaborating with the World Bank, in particular, will \ncontinue efforts to harmonize approaches to using country safeguard systems.7  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will improve the implementation of environment and social safeguards through \nstrengthened country safeguard systems in DMCs. The TA\u2019s primary purpose is to set out the \napproach and methodology for assessing the potential application of country safeguard systems \nthrough detailed assessments of safeguard systems in DMCs to identify areas of commonality \nand gaps that will require capacity building, policy adaptation, and improved procedural clarity \nand definition. The assessments will not only support more effective planning of safeguard \napplications, but will also allow greater focus on achieving more effective implementation. The \nemphasis will be on setting out characteristics of country safeguard systems through a typology \nof levels of preparedness and capacity in selected countries. Given the large differences in \nDMCs\u2019 levels of legal and institutional development, the assessments will require identification \nand analyses of policy and procedural gaps with respect to the objectives of ADB safeguard \npolicies. An important perspective will be to establish how ADB can be responsive to the \nchanging circumstances in DMCs, and enable those DMCs to benefit by improving their own \nsafeguard systems. DMCs can increase development investment opportunities and minimize \nsocial and environmental risks. In identifying ambiguities and inconsistencies across current \nsafeguards within DMCs and ADB, project teams and executing agencies are expected to have \na better understanding of, and increased capability in, implementing social and environmental \nsafeguards. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will involve (i) country and thematic analytical studies, (ii) a series of country and \nregional  consultations,  and  (iii)  expert  reviews.  The  TA  will  (i)  develop  a  methodological \nframework for assessing country safeguard systems in selected countries, reflecting the varying \ncapacities of DMCs in planning and implementing safeguards; (ii) identify practical approaches \nto developing more effective business processes in project processing and implementation; and \n(iii) further strengthen relationships with governments, institutions, and civil society in developing \ncountry safeguard systems and applying ADB safeguard policies. The TA outputs will be (i) an \n                                                 \n6  Progress has been made in Viet Nam, where ADB, the World Bank, and the Japan Bank for International \nCooperation collaborated on harmonizing procedures for procurement, financial management, environment and \nsocial safeguards, portfolio management, and economic/sector work (January 2003). \n7  Under its policy on Piloting the Use of Borrower Systems to Address Environmental and Social Safeguard Issues in \nBank-Supported Projects (18 March 2005), the World Bank is proceeding with a 2-year pilot phase to test the use \nof country safeguard systems, in close consultation with other multilateral financing institutions, involving 14 pilot \noperations. \n ", "4   \nunderstanding  of  policy,  legislative,  and  institutional  gaps,  and  opportunities  in  DMCs  for \nimproving country safeguard systems; (ii) identification of medium-term programs to strengthen \ncountry safeguard systems and capacities; (iii) harmonized approaches between ADB and \ndevelopment partners on the use of country systems in selected DMCs; and (iv) clear and \nconsistent  operational  directions  on  safeguards  that  will  guide  the  development  and \nimplementation of ADB projects. \n \n11.  Several  country  and  thematic  studies  are  needed  to  assess  the  commonalities  of \nsafeguard  systems  in  selected  countries8  with  ADB  safeguard  policies.  Establishing  such \ncommonalities  will  require  analyses  of  legal,  regulatory,  and  administrative  frameworks  at \nnational,  subnational,  and  where  appropriate,  institutional  levels.  In  identifying  the \ncommonalities or equivalence with ADB policies, practices, and institutional capacities, the \nstudies will analyze gaps that require specific process improvements. The studies will involve \nreviews  of  experience  with  safeguards  in  selected  ADB-financed  projects,  sectors,  and \ninstitutions at national and subnational levels. By obtaining a clear picture of the status of \nsafeguard applications, ADB can improve delivery of its policy and procedural requirements and \ndeliver  the  benefits  of  its  development  interventions  more  effectively.  The  studies  will \ncharacterize countries at various levels and stages of safeguard planning and implementation \ncapacities. The outputs of the studies and analyses will be reflected in ADB\u2019s safeguard policy \nupdate being conducted in parallel, and the policy documentation will then be reviewed by a \npanel of internationally recognized safeguard experts. It is intended that the outputs will be \nconsistent with middle-income country and IEI business processes. The TA will take a phased \napproach, with in-house reviews and discussions followed by consultations. A technical contact \ngroup will be established to review documentation and the TA\u2019s progress.  \n \n12.  Consultations  with  DMC  governments,  institutions,  civil  society  organizations,  and \nspecialized nongovernment organizations will be a critical part of developing approaches to \nusing country safeguard systems. The consultative process, which will be detailed by the time of \ninception, seeks to achieve as wide and appropriate a representation as possible at national \nand subregional levels. This is to ensure that debate and understanding are adequate for \nstakeholders  and  ADB.  Consultations  will  be  structured  around  (i)  presentations  on \nassessments of country safeguard systems and discussions on ADB\u2019s safeguard policy update \nin  relation  to  improving  safeguard  applications,  (ii)  feedback  sessions  by  stakeholders  on \npolicies and procedures relevant to the adoption of such systems, and (iii) documentation of                        \ndiscussions that will then be posted on the web. The external consultative process will involve e-\nmail exchanges and website discussions, for which a safeguard website has been developed \nthat includes links to the three policies, OM sections, handbooks, and checklists. Consultation \nworkshops are expected to take 1 or 2 days.  \n \n13.  The consultative process will include (i) five subregional consultations; (ii) five or more \ncountry consultations (at least one from each of the five subregions, with close involvement of \nresident  missions);  and  (iii)  consultations  in  North  America,  Europe,  and  Japan.  Online \nconsultations through the safeguard website and e-mail, as well as external expert consultations \nwill run in parallel with the various consultation workshops.  \n \n                                                 \n8  The selection of countries will be based on the assessment of policy application and country safeguard capacity \nissues related to ADB-financed operations. Possible candidates are India, Indonesia, the Kyrgyz Republic, the \nPhilippines, the PRC, and Viet Nam. ADB will request no-objection from the government of any selected country \nbefore implementing the TA in such country.  \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  and  the  Environment  and  Social \nSafeguard Division (RSES) will be responsible for carrying out day-to-day activities under the \nTA.  ADB  will  recruit  international consultants  (safeguard  specialists  qualified  in  involuntary \nresettlement, environment, and indigenous peoples) for a total of 7.5 person-months to assess \ncommonalities and review experience in the three areas. A panel of international experts for the \nthree safeguards will be engaged as resource persons for 0.5 person-months each. Domestic \nconsultants will be engaged in selected countries for 16 person-months to prepare background \npapers for specific project and institutional reviews. TA proceeds will be used to engage (i) a \nfacilitator (international consultant) for the country and regional consultations, to help conduct \nworkshops and prepare feedback and analytical documentation (7 person-months intermittently \nover 12 months); and (ii) technical support staff who specialize in outreach and communications \nand provide support for organizational arrangements for the studies and consultative processes \n(10  person-months).  All  consultants  will  be  engaged  as  individuals  in  accordance  with \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants.  Terms  of \nreference for international and domestic consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  TA proceeds will be used to organize country consultations on the possible application of \ncountry systems and discussions on policy and procedural commonalities. This will be done in \ncollaboration with governments, executing agencies, and civil society organizations (CSOs) in \nselected  countries.  ADB  will  organize  regional  consultations  to  cover  more  countries.  Civil \nsociety  representatives  will  be  invited.  ADB  will  selectively  finance  the  travel  and \naccommodation costs of participants who cannot afford to participate in the country and regional \nconsultations.  \n \n17.  The TA is expected to start in January 2006 and end by March 2007.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening Country Safeguard Systems and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \n  Mechanisms   \n \nImpact       \nImproved ability to  Strengthened country  National social and  Assumption \ndevelop, implement,  safeguard systems lead  environmental  \u2022  Close collaboration with \nand enforce social and  to enhanced country  development indicators  DMCs, civil society, and \nenvironmental  ownership, increased   in DMCs  other stakeholders in \nsafeguards in ADB  development impact and    establishing areas of \nDMCs through  sustainability, and greater  Project processing and  commonality and \nstrengthened country  harmonization with  implementation  consensus on \nsafeguard systems  development partners on  performance  safeguards \n  safeguard policies  documentation \n \nNational, subnational, \nand institutional reports \non the application and \nimplementation of \nsafeguard policies \nOutcome       \nA structured approach  Assessments and  Reports on country  Assumptions \nto assessing country  analyses in selected  commonality  \u2022  Adequate information \nsafeguard systems in  countries of country  assessments at national  available on legal and \nselected DMCs  safeguard systems to  and state levels  regulatory frameworks, \ndeveloped;

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is initiating a regional technical assistance (TA) \nactivity that will require detailed assessments of safeguard systems in developing member \ncountries (DMCs). These assessments will identify areas of commonality and those in which \ncomplementarity will require capacity building, policy adaptation, and procedural clarity and \ndefinition. The emphasis will be on developing detailed characterization of safeguard systems \nwithin the selected countries using a typology of levels of preparedness and capacity. Given the \nwide differences in the levels of legal and institutional development in DMCs, the assessments \nshould identify and analyze policy and procedural gaps in ADB safeguard policies. The key \nfocus will be to establish how ADB can be responsive to changing circumstances in DMCs, and \nenable  DMCs  to  improve  their  own  safeguard  systems,  thereby  increasing  development \ninvestment opportunities and delivering benefits by minimizing social and environmental risks.  \n \n2.  The TA is expected to (i) develop a methodological framework for applying a country \nsafeguard systems approach under the overall framework of the safeguard policy update being \ncarried out in parallel; (ii) identify practical approaches in developing more effective business \nprocesses; and (iii) strengthen relationships with governments, institutions, and civil society in \ndeveloping country safeguard systems and applying ADB safeguard policies. \n \n3.  The TA will require the services of internationally recruited safeguard specialists and a \npanel of experts. They will assess country commonalities, review ADB experiences, and provide \ngeneral advisory support to the ADB safeguard policy update in the Environment and Social \nSafeguard Division (RSES). The safeguard update will be led by RSES principal safeguard \nspecialist, who will lead the team. Domestic consultants will carry out specific country and \nproject review studies that will support the work of the international experts. \n \nA.  Safeguard Specialists and Panel of Experts \n \n  1.  Scope of Work \n \n4.  The safeguard specialists will be required to conduct country safeguard assessments in \nselected countries,1 review the impacts of ADB-funded projects, and help the team leader \nreview  and  analyze  experiences.  This  will  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  ADB\u2019s  safeguard \npolicies, and keep those relevant to changing client needs and new lending modalities and \ninstruments. The country and thematic studies are intended to identify commonalities of country \nsafeguard systems with ADB safeguard policies. Establishing such commonalities will require \nanalyses of legal, regulatory, and administrative frameworks at national, subnational, and where \nappropriate,  institutional  levels.  In  identifying  the  commonalities  or  equivalence  with  ADB \npolicies, practices, and institutional capacities, the studies will analyze gaps that require specific \nprocess improvements. The studies will review experience with safeguards in selected ADB-\nfinanced projects, sectors, and institutions at the national and subnational levels. This will \nprovide a clear picture of the status of safeguard applications, which, in turn, will allow ADB to \nimprove its policy and procedural requirements for delivering the benefits of its development \ninterventions  more  effectively.  The  studies  will  establish  directions  for  safeguard  policies \nthrough detailed matrixes that characterize countries at various stages of safeguard planning \nand different levels of implementation capacity. The outcomes of the studies and analyses will \n                                                 \n1  The selection of countries will be based on the assessment of policy application and country safeguard capacity \nissues related to ADB-financed operations.
