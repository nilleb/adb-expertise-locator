INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested a policy and \nadvisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The assistance \nwill support the Land Consolidation and Rehabilitation Center (LCRC) of the Ministry of Land \nand Resources (MLR) in conducting a research on intensive and economical land use mode in \nsmall and medium-sized cities and small towns. The ADB project team conducted consultations \nand  agreed  with  LCRC  on  the  TA  project\u2019s  objective,  scope,  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  costs,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  as \nreflected in this report. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Need to develop small and medium-sized cities and small towns. The Third Plenary \nSession of the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China identified the need for \ndevelopment plans to be based on sound and scientific analysis according to the size and \nlayout of each unique urban agglomeration. Small and medium-sized cities and small towns are \nencouraged to develop industries, provide public services, create jobs, and attract more people. \nThe PRC\u2019s National New-Type Urbanization Plan, 2014\u20132020 also promotes the development \nof small and medium-sized cities and small towns to achieve the urbanization targets and \noverall development strategy of the country.2 The plan aims to optimize the city size and \nstructure, and economical use of land. Cities and towns are encouraged to properly guide the \nlocation of industry and public service, and improve the quality and quantity of such services. \nIndustrial projects should be established in small and medium-sized cities and small towns with \nstrong environment carrying capacity and high development potential. Cities and towns are also \nencouraged to make use of local resources to develop industries that have local advantages, \nthrough which the function of large cities could be dispersed to small and medium-sized cities \nand small towns. \n \n3.  Rapid development led to loss of farmlands. Land is a limited resource. Compact and \nefficient urban development has long been a global issue. Expansion of urban areas poses \nchallenges for infrastructure provision and protection of the environment and farmland. The \ndevelopment of small and medium-sized cities and small towns often leads to significant loss of \narable land, which threatens the country\u2019s food security. Furthermore, during their development, \neconomic profitability usually becomes a major concern as ecological and social effects are \nignored due to the absence of systematic environmental planning and strict environmental law \nenforcement, and limited economic capacity. This has led to increased ecological pressure and \nlow sustainability of land use. \n \n4.  Unsystematic  land  use  in  small  and  medium-sized  cities  and  small  towns. \nUrbanization in the PRC is progressing at an unprecedented rate along with the serious problem \nof urban sprawl. During 2006\u20132010, the speed of urban sprawl in small and medium-sized cities \nwas twice as fast as during 2001\u20132005. Local governments gain revenue from land-use-right \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 August 2014.  \n2  Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State \nCouncil.  2014.  The  National  New-Type  Urbanization  Plan,  2014\u20132020.  http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/2014-\n03/16/content_2640075.htm. By 2020, the plan targets that about 60% of the country\u2019s population will live in urban \nareas, and about 45% of the country\u2019s population will hold an urban registration (hukou). \n ", "2   \ntransfers.3 In some developed areas, about half to two-thirds of a city\u2019s fiscal income comes \nfrom land transfers; this percentage is even higher in some inland cities. Local governments try \nto acquire construction land and earn revenue through land-use-right transfers to industries that \ncan also contribute to revenues by paying taxes and creating jobs. Also, local government \nperformance is measured primarily by the growth of its gross domestic product, so transferring \nland to industry also boosts local performance results. \n \n5.  Low intensity of land use in small and medium-sized cities and small towns. \nCurrent urban development focuses on expansion and ignores the structural optimization of \nstock land resource.4 Small and medium-sized cities and small towns tend to pursue expansion. \nSome local governments are enthusiastic in developing new areas and pay less attention to \nredeveloping old cities and reutilizing land. Low land use efficiency in built-up areas has left a \nhuge volume of stock land resources idle. The average floor area ratio in cities is only about \n0.3.5 More than 40% of land is used inefficiently, and 5% is idle. In particular, industrial land use \nin small and medium-sized cities and small towns is inefficient and lacks proper guidance. As a \nresult, industrial land is dispersed and the output per unit of land is low.  \n \n6.  Unreasonable land use structure and layout in small and medium-sized cities and \nsmall towns. Although both the total volume and the area per capita of construction land have \nsignificantly increased, the structural imbalance due to the abundance of industrial land and \nscarcity  of  land  for  public  infrastructure  and  green  space  is  a  problem.  In  spatial  layout, \nresidential, industrial, and commercial land uses are unsystematically intertwined, hampering \nthe development of urban functions. The pervading phenomenon of idle or wasted land leads to \nlow efficiency in land use. \n \n7.  Need for study on intensive and economical land use mode in small and medium-\nsized  cities  and  small  towns.  In  recent  years,  the  central  government  has  been  taking \nmeasures to encourage the efficient use of land. In 2004, the PRC State Council issued Decree \nNo. 28 to strengthen reform and land management, requesting governments to establish a \nmechanism for intensive and economical land use and benefit sharing. In 2012, MLR issued \nDocument No. 47 to facilitate the establishment of a mechanism on intensive and economical \nland use. Subsequently, MLR and the National Development and Reform Commission updated \nthe  restricted  and  prohibited  inventories  of  land  use  and  MLR  issued  Decree  No.  53  on \nmeasures to manage abandoned land. Despite such efforts, improving land use efficiency is still \nchallenging. MLR issued Order No. 61 in May 2014 on the new Regulation on Intensive and \nEconomical Land Use, which will be effective in September 2014. However, the regulation is too \ngeneral  and  lacks  practical  policy,  methods,  and  implementation  guidelines.  Thus,  a \nrecommendation is urgently needed to provide practical policy and implementation guidelines to \npromote intensive and economical land use. The PRC\u2019s land problem was created as a result of \npowers and intentions from various sectors, and therefore immediate large-scale reform is \ndifficult.   \n \n8.  Globally, research to improve land use efficiency has proliferated and produced a rich \nbody of findings. Current land use efficiency in small and medium-sized cities and small towns \nin  the  PRC  illustrates  the  urgency  to  learn  from  international  cases.  The  TA  will  provide \n                                                \n3  Local governments benefit financially by transforming collectively-owned land to state-owned land by acquiring \ncollectively-owned land with the government compensation rate, then auctioning the land use right to users at \nmarket rates. \n4  Land that is already occupied or used as construction land. \n5  Average floor area ratio in developed countries is about 1.0. Floor area ratio is the ratio of a building\u2019s total floor \narea to the size of the piece of land upon which it is built. \n ", "  3 \nrecommendations to MLR on practical policy and implementation guidelines to realize intensive \nand economical land use in small and medium-sized cities and small towns. It will use a case \nstudy approach, drawing lessons from countries that have dealt with similar land use challenges, \nand will consider how to apply the lessons and innovations to selected case study cities and \ntowns  in  the  PRC.  The  TA  will  select  representative  cities  and  towns  so  that  practical \napplications of policies and implementation guidelines may be replicated. Valuable international \nlessons  in  efficient  land  use  in  small  and  medium-sized  cities  could  be  learned  from  the \napplication  of  various  urban  and  regional  planning,  urban  growth  management,  and  land \nconsolidation  techniques.  Both  international  and  domestic  practices  must  be  compared, \nevaluated, and summarized, and recommendations made on whether and how to adapt foreign \nexperiences to the PRC setting.  \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be better knowledge and stronger policies adopted for intensive and \neconomical land use in small and medium-sized cities and small towns. The outcome will be \nrecommendations  available  for  policy  and  implementation  guidelines  to  improve  land  use \nconditions in small and medium-sized cities and small towns.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The outputs will be (i) a research report on intensive and economical land use mode for \nsmall and medium-sized cities and small towns, and (ii) policy suggestions for intensive and \neconomical use of land in selected small and medium-sized cities and small towns.  \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented using a combination of consultation and research with \nquantitative  and  qualitative  analysis  in  a  phased  manner  through  reports,  focus  group \ndiscussions, and workshops that will be shared with local governments. Case studies will be \ndeveloped throughout the research process.  \n \n12.  First, a study on theories and practices from international cases focusing on small and \nmedium-sized  cities  will  be  conducted.  Intensive  and  economical  land  use  modes  will  be \nclassified, assessed, and summarized based on international practices. Findings will bring new \nand innovative perspectives and provide valuable information for further case studies in the \nPRC and policy suggestions for local governments. \n \n13.  Second,  domestic  land  use  issues  and  practices  in  various  urbanization  conditions \nincluding large, medium, and small-sized cities and small towns will be summarized, evaluated, \nand explored in detail. The study will identify existing problems of inefficient land use and \nsummarize typical modes of intensive and economical land use in the PRC setting. \n \n14.  Based  on  the  study,  policy  recommendations  and  suggestions  for  intensive  and \neconomical, people-centered, inclusive, environmentally and socially friendly, and rational land \nuse mode will be prepared. The TA will produce policy suggestions applicable to selected small \nand medium-sized cities and small towns. Drawing on experience and lessons from selected \ncases, discussions with stakeholders relating to efficient land use will be held to exchange \nopinions to address multidimensional and complicated issues on land use. Lessons can be \nexpanded to improve development practices of other small and medium-sized cities and small \ntowns. \n ", "4   \n15.  Activities  for  output  1 will  include  the following: (i)  hold  an  inception  workshop, (ii) \nprepare an international case study report, (iii) finalize the international case study report after \nthe concluding workshop, (iv) prepare domestic case studies, (v) conduct a study tour, (vi) hold \na midterm workshop, (vii) integrate the international and domestic case study reports into one \ndraft research report, and (viii) hold a concluding workshop on case studies and submit the final \nreport. Activities for output 2 are: (i) compile a report on policy suggestions for selected small \nand medium-sized cities, (ii) hold a TA final workshop, and (iii) prepare a policy brief with key \npolicy recommendations. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $360,000, of which $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). LCRC will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of technical expertise, office accommodation, office supplies and \nequipment, printing, a part of the workshops and study tour, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  LCRC will be the executing agency. It has established a project management office to \nmanage  the  consultants  and  monitor  the  quality  and  timing  of  deliverables.  The  project \nmanagement office leader will closely monitor the quality control of TA outputs and regularly \ncommunicate with the consultant team leader and ADB project officers on the progress and \nquality of project outputs. The TA will be implemented from 1 January 2015 to 30 June 2016. \n \n18.  The TA will fund national and international consultants. National consultants will include \n(i) a land use policy specialist and team leader (5 person-months), (ii) an urban planning \nspecialist and deputy team leader (3 person-months), (iii) a land and real estate legal specialist \n(3  person-months),  (iv)  a  land  economics  specialist  (3  person-months),  and  (v)  a  land \nmanagement specialist (3 person-months). The international consultants will comprise three \nland use specialists for a total of 7 person-months.  \n \n19.  A consulting firm will be engaged to provide national expertise (total of 17 person-\nmonths) and for overall management and logistical arrangements throughout the TA by working \nclosely with LCRC. ADB will recruit the firm using the consultants\u2019 qualification selection method, \nwith biodata technical proposal. This method will be used because highly specialized expertise \nis required. The three international consultants (total of 7 person-months) will be engaged as \nindividual consultants. All consultants under the TA will be selected based on their academic \nqualification and relevant work experience in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Services to support consultations and \nworkshops will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n20.  The TA will fund workshops to discuss the case studies and explore ways to adapt \nlessons from international cases into the PRC setting. Five workshops are planned and relevant \nstakeholders will participate. The TA will also partially fund a study tour for the counterpart \ngovernment  officials  and  decision  makers  from  domestic  case  study  cities  to  learn  from \ninternational experiences and bring back innovative ideas. The location of the study tour will be \ndetermined  during  the  international  case  study  and  the  tour  will  be  conducted  during  the \ndomestic case study period. The findings from the study tour will be presented at the midterm \nworkshop  and  will  be  reflected  in  the  research  report.  LCRC  will  select  the  appropriate \nparticipants for the study tour. \n ", "  5 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.
