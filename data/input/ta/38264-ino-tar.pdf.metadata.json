INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  Since 1999 the Government of Indonesia has introduced major decentralization reforms \nthat  have  devolved  significant  authorities,  functional  responsibilities,  and  funding  from  the \ncentral government to provincial, district, and city governments. With the support of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB), with which it has been working since 1998, the Government has \ndeveloped a medium-term sector development program, the National Action Plan for Fiscal \nDecentralization (NAPFD) 2005\u20132009. An ADB program loan of $300 million for the First Local \nGovernment  Finance  and  Governance  Reform  Program  (LGFGRP  1)  was  approved  and \ndisbursed in a single tranche in 2005. A related project loan of $30 million, mainly to support \ninvestments  in  subnational  governments,  was  approved  in  late  2005  and  is  now  being \nimplemented. Since the start of LGFGRP 1 processing around 2003, the Government has made \nvery significant progress including: (i) putting in place a comprehensive package of financial \nlaws and regulations reaching down to the districts and cities ; (ii) improving coordination across \ncentral and regional governments, partly by strengthening the President\u2019s main decentralization \nadvisory  body  (Dewan  Pertimbangan  Otonomi  Daerah  [DPOD]);  (iii) introducing  technical \nimprovements  in  grant  transfer  formulation,  thus  improving  horizontal  and  vertical  equity; \n(iv) preparing a sectorwide medium-term plan (NAPFD) to strengthen financial management \naspects of decentralization; (v) drafting a taxation reform bill, now before the national parliament \n(Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat [DPR]) to strengthen the local tax base while lessening the impact of \nsmall nuisance taxes; and (vi) making significant longer-term efforts to strengthen financial \nsystems, institutions, and human capacity at decentralized levels, with major financial and \ntechnical support from ADB and other donors.1   \n \n2  During  the  2006  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  reaffirmed  the \nunderstanding it had reached with ADB in 2005 under LGFGRP 1 to proceed to a second \nprogram loan, and requested ADB for technical assistance2 (TA) to support (i) a review of policy \nprogress and updating of the NAPFD, (ii) the preparation of an agreed set of policy actions for \nimplementation under LGFGRP 2, and (iii) completion of the finally agreed actions. The current \ncountry strategy and program, (CSP) 2006\u20132009,3 puts decentralization and local government \nfinance and governance issues at the forefront. The project preparatory TA (PPTA) and the \nproposed LGFGRP 2 are part of the CSP and received concept clearance at the TA Concept \nPaper Meeting in April 2007. The Government has confirmed the impact, outcome, outputs, and \nimplementation arrangements (Appendix 1); cost and financing arrangements (Appendix 2); and \nterms of reference for the PPTA (Appendix 3).  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  In many respects the very significant (\u201cbig bang\u201d) approach to decentralization begun in \n2001 in Indonesia has been a qualified success. Reforms have involved the massive delegation \n                                                 \n1  Assistance in the development of human resource and institutional capacity is being provided through ongoing \nADB projects like ADB. 2005. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a \nProposed Loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the Local Government Finance and Governance Reform. Manila \n(for $30 million); ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Supporting an Effective \nInstitutional Framework for Fiscal Decentralization. Manila (TA 4682-INO, for $0.5 million); and ADB. 2005. \nTechnical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Support for Local Government Performance Measurement \nSystem. Manila (TA 9082-INO, for $0.73 million). Earlier, similar support was provided through the recently \ncompleted ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for the Local Government Financing. \nManila (TA 4282-INO, for $0.6 million); and ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for \nSustaining Decentralization and Local Government Reforms. Manila (TA 4543-INO, for $0.9 million). \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 October 2007.  \n3  ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132009): Indonesia. Manila. \n ", "2   \nof  responsibility  for  public  service  provision  and  the  reassignment  of  two  thirds  of  central \ngovernment civil servants and more than 16,000 service delivery facilities to the subnational \ngovernments. The share of regional governments in total government expenditures has nearly \ndoubled, to almost 40%, making Indonesia one of Asia\u2019s most decentralized countries. Fears \nabout the potential chaos that could follow the \u201cbig bang\u201d have not materialized. However, over \nthe last 6 years there has been continuous need for reform and fine-tuning, to make the \ndecentralized system more functional and coherent. In particular, issues of quality and equity of \nservice delivery between poor and better-off regions require long-term attention, as do issues \nlike transparency, accountability, and capacity.  \n \n4.  The  first  program  loan  focused  on  supporting  the  Government  in  finalizing  a  large \nnumber of legal, regulatory, and policy reforms to underpin the major political moves toward \ndecentralization  from  1999.  As  part  of  this  support,  the  NAPFD  was  prepared  by  the \nGovernment to guide further planning and policy work in 2005\u20132009. The NAPFD provides a \nvery extensive menu of further reforms and capacity development initiatives for the medium to \nlonger term. A wide range of NAPFD-planned future actions were considered in designing the \ntechnical assistance. In addition, a joint study by the Government and ADB in March 2007 \nidentified a subset of the priority areas to be included in the PPTA.  \n \n5.  The study identified broad issues for more detailed review and possible inclusion under \nthe PPTA and eventually LGFGRP 2. The issues were: (i) the rapid creation of new regional \ngovernments; 4 (ii) the unclear assignment of expenditure responsibilities; (iii) the contradictory \nfunctional assignments in the decentralization laws vis-\u00e0-vis the sectoral laws, along with the \nencroachment of central government agencies on the functional responsibilities of regional \ngovernments; (iv) uncertainty about the quality of service delivered by regional governments; \n(v) the  inefficient  composition  of  regional  government  expenditures, with  a  disproportionate \nshare  of  wages  and  salaries  and  general  administration  services;  (vi) the  insufficient \ndecentralization of revenues, with own revenues making up a small share of regional revenues, \ncomplicated  by  distortional  nuisance  local  taxes;  (vii)  the  large  system  of  unconditional \nequalization  grants  (dana  alokasi  umum  [DAU])  with  a  diminished  equalization  impact  on \nhorizontal fiscal disparities because of a hold-harmless provision for all regional governments \nand DAU fund diversion to pay all civil servants of regional governments directly from the center; \n(viii) the incipient but fast-growing system of conditional and special grants (dana alokasi khusus \n[DAK]), which are still improperly defined and underfunded, although there are plans to shift \n\u201cdeconcentrated funds,\u201d now administered by the line ministries and central agencies, to the \nDAK; (ix) the low levels of borrowing by regional governments; and (x) the lack of capacity and \nhuman  capital  for  proper  planning,  budgeting,  and  execution  despite  the  adequate  legal \nframework for budgeting, and the overall weakness in external audit and evaluation.  \n \n6.  The review confirmed the importance of these issues and discussions during fact finding \nmission brought out the fact that some (notably issues v, vii, viii, and x) are being addressed by \nthe Government in varying degrees. The PPTA will address the core issues among those \nremaining (notably i, ii, iii, vi, and viii), and may also deal with other issues if necessary. As \nrequested by the Government, the country\u2019s recent experiences with policy reform, particularly \nunder LGFGRP 1, will be evaluated and the NAPFD policy matrix will be updated to guide the \ndevelopment of proposed actions under LGFGRP 2 and the work of the PPTA. The formal \nreview may largely confirm the findings of the background study even as it provides opportunity \nfor flexibility in the PPTA activities. \n \n                                                 \n4  The term \u201cregional government\u201d is used synonymously with \u201clocal government\u201d in this paper.  \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The  anticipated  impact  of  the  longer-term  program  is  more  transparent,  efficient, \nequitable, and effective management and use of public resources for regional development \nthrough better intergovernmental financing arrangements, including fiscal transfers and local \ntaxes. The expected outcome of the PPTA will be the adoption of policy changes by the \nGovernment  in  local  government  finance  and  governance  reforms  leading  to  the  timely \nprocessing of LGFGRP 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  From  the  NAPFD  and  the  diagnostic  paper,  substantive  policy  actions  that  the \nGovernment can implement with the support of the PPTA, have been identified. Whereas the \nkey PPTA activities correspond closely to the anticipated policy matrix under the proposed \nprogram  loan,  the  policy  matrix  requires  considerable  further  discussion  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. The PPTA activities (and thus the PPTA approach) must therefore \nremain flexible. In addition to the activities listed below, the eventual program loan policy matrix \nwill record the many other achievements that have been made or are being undertaken through \nthe Government\u2019s own efforts since 2005. The proposed PPTA activities are as follows. \n \n9.  Activity 1: Take stock of LGFGRP performance and update the NAPFD policy \nmatrix. At the start of the PPTA, the performance under LGFGRP 1 will be evaluated and the \nNAPFD policy matrix will be updated, leading to the preparation of a government policy paper \nsetting out revisions in the NAPFD policy matrix and recommendations for an appropriate policy \naction matrix for the LGFGRP 2. As mentioned in paras 4 and 5 above, a broad study was done \nto  identify  areas  where  reform  interventions  would  be  more  rewarding.  However,  the \nGovernment is interested in a joint formal review that may shape the ultimate scope of the \nPPTA.  The  stocktaking  will  allow  the  proposed  PPTA  activities  to  be  fine-tuned  and  may \nindicate additional activities that need to be undertaken. Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan \nNasional (BAPPENAS), the national development planning agency, will be the Implementing \nAgency (IA) for this activity in close coordination with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the \nMinistry of Home Affairs (MOHA). \n \n10.  Activity 2: Support the Government and ADB in preparing a final policy action \nmatrix. The matrix will benefit from the joint study, the updated NAPFD policy matrix prepared \nunder activity 1, and the background studies to be done for activities 1\u20136. The Directorate \nGeneral of Fiscal Balance of the MOF will be the IA for this activity. \n \n11.   Activity 3: In support of two new forthcoming government regulations, study and \ndraft  a  grand  strategy  paper  for  the  national  parliament  (DPR)  addressing  the \nproliferation of new subnational governments. The PPTA will support a further study of the \ncosts and benefits of creating regional governments and the implications for service delivery. It \nwill assist MOHA in analyzing the evaluation data it is now collecting on the size, economic \nbases, amalgamation policy options, performance, and other aspects of the operations of new \nregional governments. This analysis and other information to be collected will assist MOHA in \ndrafting for the DPR a grand strategy paper on the optimal number of regional governments in \nIndonesia. This strategy paper will support the implementation of two forthcoming government \nregulations on the evaluation of (i) proposals for the establishment of new regional governments, \nand (ii) the performance of regional governments (including their dissolution or merger). The IA \n ", "4   \nfor this activity will be the Directorate of Regional Management and Special Autonomy, under \nthe Directorate General of Regional Autonomy of MOHA. \n \n12.  Activity 4: Support the amendment of sector laws and regulations to make them \nconsistent  with  the  new  expenditure  assignments  and  other  legislation  on \ndecentralization. The PPTA will support the removal of inefficiencies and confusion caused by \ninconsistent  legislation  dating  back  to  pre-decentralization  times.  It  will  also  support  the \npreparation of mapping documentation to identify amendments to the main set of sectoral laws \nand regulations required by the new Regulation 38/07 on Assignment of Expenditures. Policy \nand practical recommendations will be made regarding the best approaches to dealing with the \nmassive regulatory load (at least 31 laws and 600 regulations to be reviewed, according to initial \nassessments). Additionally, detailed recommendations and draft amendments to relevant laws \nand regulations will be prepared for two pilot ministries to be selected at the start. Overview \ninformation will be provided to allow monitoring of the national response while reform strategies \nare being developed for the ministries and particularly for the two pilot ministries. The IA for this \nactivity will be the Directorate of Regional Autonomy Facilitation under the Directorate General \nof Regional Autonomy of MOHA.  \n \n13.  Activity  5:  Study  options  for  enhancing  the  revenue  autonomy  of  regional \ngovernments, particularly by decentralizing the property tax. The PPTA will support the \nIA\u2014the Directorate of Regional Taxes and Redistribution under the Directorate General of \nFiscal Balance of the MOF\u2014in studying the options for the phased decentralization of the \nproperty tax, including such matters as the rate-setting discretion of regional governments; the \nsectors to be decentralized (only urban and rural properties or also the forestry, mining, and \noil/petroleum sectors); and the feasibility of asymmetric administration of large cities. The study \nmust build flexibly on amendments to Law 34/00 on Regional Taxes and Redistribution, now \nunder debate in the DPR and likely to be passed by early 2008. The Government and DPR are \nexpected to take a phased approach to the decentralization of the property tax. The PPTA will \nsupport further phases of regulatory and legal reforms as well as practical planning of the \nimplementation of the first phase of reforms, and also the development of a medium-term road \nmap for tax and revenue reforms (as a subset of the NAPFD). But the LGFGR 2 program loan \nactions are not likely to extend to the passage of amendments by the Government and DPR \nother than those now before them, as these amendments can take considerable time. \n \n14.  Activity 6: Carry out policy work to support the transfer of deconcentration funds \nto the DAK. Depending on the progress in the implementation of Law 33/04 on DAK and \nsubject to further discussions with the Government, this activity may be partially or completely \nrevised during TA start-up. The PPTA will support the IA\u2014the Directorate of Evaluation of \nRegional Financial Information under the Directorate General of Fiscal Balance of the MOF\u2014in \nplanning the transition of deconcentration funds, where appropriate, for switching to the DAK \nwithin  a  clear  time  frame.  Significant  deconcentration  funds  (at  least  50%  of  appropriate \nprograms and activities, compared with the actual 2007 outcomes) are likely to be transferred to \nthe DAK in the 2009 budget submission. The PPTA will support MOF in identifying key areas of \ndeconcentration funding and in developing strategies for making budget changes in at least two \nkey sector ministries.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1 million equivalent. The PPTA in the amount \nof $700,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the \nGovernment of Japan. The ADB financing will cover consulting services, report production, and \n ", "  5\nmiscellaneous administrative and workshop costs. The Government will finance the remaining \n$300,000 equivalent to cover mainly in-kind office accommodation and support services (see \nAppendix 2). The Government has been informed that approval of the PPTA does not commit \nADB to financing any ensuing program or project, nor the Government to borrowing the funds. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  As agreed, the Executing Agency for the PPTA will be the MOF Directorate General of \nFiscal Balance, most likely through the Office of the Secretary to the Director General. MOF, \nMOHA,  and  BAPPENAS  will  be  the  Implementing  Agencies  for  the  different  activities,  as \ndetailed above. A small high-level external advisory panel, to be composed of Indonesian \nacademics and representatives from regional governments, will be appointed to provide peer \nreview and quality oversight, to coordinate between key government agencies and the PPTA \nteam, and to provide a regional government perspective. \n \n17.  International consultants will be hired for 14 person-months and national consultants for \n33  person-months,  to  provide  expertise  in  fiscal  policy  aspects  of  decentralization, \nintergovernmental  financial  arrangements,  optimal  sizes  of  regional  governments,  property \ntaxation, structuring of specific grants, deconcentration funding, and preparation of amendments \nto financial laws and regulations. The outline terms of reference and reporting arrangements are \nset out in Appendix 3. All the consultants will be hired as individuals by ADB according to its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Experience in \nIndonesia has shown that hiring consulting firms is much more expensive than hiring individual \nconsultants, and does not always produce the right mix of consultants. The hiring of individual \nconsultants is also justified for the following reasons: (i) a single firm will be hard put to provide \nthe diverse set of specialized skills required; (ii) while timing is of the essence in ensuring that \nthe PPTA outputs make a meaningful contribution to the preparation of the LGFGRP 2 starting \nin November 2007, firm recruitment adds 4 months to the start-up; and (iii) any difficulties in \nproject administration will be mitigated by engaging a national project administrator and an \ninternational team leader, who will help coordinate and manage the recruitment process. \n \n18.  The PPTA is expected to be implemented over a 12-month period, starting in January \n2008. The outputs\u2014in the form of policy reports and policy-related seminars and workshops\u2014\nwill be disseminated progressively after the negotiations for the proposed LGFGRP 2 program \nloan. An updated NAPFD policy matrix will be published and widely distributed. The proposed \nexternal advisory panel will assist ADB in providing quality control and outcome evaluation. \nMOF has agreed to facilitate the provision of adequate furnished office accommodation for the \nPPTA  team,  including  telephone  and  fax  lines  and  Internet  connection  facilities.  Both \nBAPPENAS and MOHA will also provide adequate desk space for the consultants who will work \nfrom there intermittently. Basic office and computer equipment worth $12,000 will be purchased \nfor the team. These assets will be procured and disposed by the consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007 as amended from time to time).     \n     \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Indonesia  for  preparing  the  Second  Local  Government  Finance  and \nGovernance Reform Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nLonger-term program  (cid:131)  Improved horizontal  (cid:131)  Review of completed  (cid:131)  National \nleads to more  and vertical equity in  policy actions and legal  Government \ntransparent, efficient,  intergovernmental  reforms  continues its \nequitable, and  financing    commitment and \neffective  arrangements  (cid:131)  Analysis of  support, including \nmanagement and use    consolidated regional  passing the \nof public resources  (cid:131)  Higher percentage of  government fiscal data  necessary legal \nfor regional  revenues in local  (SIKD) available at  amendments. \ndevelopment.  income   MOF  (cid:131)  Policies have the \n      expected impact. \n     \n  Risk \n(cid:131)  The reform agenda \nis challenging, \nespecially given \nthe short time \navailable for \nfinalization. \nOutcome      Assumptions \nThe outcome of the  (cid:131)  Well-prepared  (cid:131)  NAPFD update  (cid:131)  ADB and the \nTA will be the policy  evaluation of  document  Government agree \nchanges that the  progress under    on the policy \nGovernment agrees  LGFGRP 1, NAPFD  (cid:131)  Policy reform  reform matrix. \nto make.  stocktaking, and  framework   \nupdated policy matrix   \n  (cid:131)  Appraisal and \n(cid:131)  Agreement on policy  confirmation that all \nreform areas for  agreed policy actions \nprogram loan under  and legal reforms are \nLGFGRP 2  complete  \n \n(cid:131)  All agreed policy \nactions and legal \nreforms completed \nand program loan \nprocessed  \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe Government\u2019s Medium-Term Development Plan 2005\u20132009 seeks to raise the levels of sustainable economic \ngrowth, create jobs, and accelerate the achievement of the MDGs. The strategic goal of decentralization is greater \nfiscal and human capacity for sustainable service delivery. The Government has identified a few key constraints that \nneed to be addressed: (i) unequal financing of the regions, (ii) lack of capacity at the local level, and (iii) fragility of \ndistricts throughout the country. \n \nADB\u2019s strategy for 2006\u20132009 is to help the Government achieve higher levels of pro-poor sustainable growth and to \nenhance social development. One of the five key areas of ADB\u2019s engagement is improving decentralization, with \nenhanced financial reporting as a key indicator. ADB\u2019s support for decentralization is aimed at the following outcomes: \n(i) sustainable financing of local government investments, (ii) improved capacity for fiscal accountability at the local \nlevels,  (iii)  clearer  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations,  (iv)  well-defined  functional  assignments  at  all  levels  of \ngovernment, (v) central government financing for local government based on needs, (vi) establishment of clear local \ngovernment fiscal accountability framework, and (vii) strengthened regional government capacity. \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, \netc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \nPoverty reduction will be addressed indirectly through support for improved policies and arrangements for fiscal \ntransfers from the central Government to local governments, and improved tax regimes for local governments. The \nimproved fiscal transfer policies will reduce fiscal inequality across regions, providing poorer regions with additional \nresources. The improved tax regimes will enhance the ability of local governments to generate their own revenues \nthrough property taxes and local business taxes. The improved local allocations can be spent on development to spur \nlocal growth\u2014the most effective channel for poverty reduction. \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n \nThe various policy reform measures proposed will have to be examined for possible poverty and social impact. \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence?  \n \nCoordination of poverty and social analysis work is been included in the TOR of the team leader and the national fiscal \ndecentralization policy expert to ensure that the poverty/social impact of the policy measures proposed by the various \nexperts is taken into account. \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nLGFGRP 2 is designed to improve pro-poor governance, as explained under B.2. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "                                                                                                                                                                Appendix 4  15\n   \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? \n \nThe local governments will be the primary beneficiaries of the improved fiscal arrangements. The poor and socially \nexcluded will benefit indirectly when the available public resources are used for local development. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n \nTheir potential needs are socialization of policy reforms, and capacity building in financial management and local \nbudget preparation. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \n \nThe constraints will be identified during the review and updating of the NAPFD. The constraints will be addressed over \ntime. LGFGRP 2 needs to be seen as one step in the process of identifying the constraints. The program loan will \naddress some of the constraints. Over time, other constraints will be addressed by subsequent interventions. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nThe initial stakeholders are the technical staff of the Directorate General of Fiscal Balance of the Ministry of Finance, \nthe Directorate General of Regional Autonomy (OTDA) of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Decentralization \nDirectorate of BAPPENAS (national  development planning agency), who  will  benefit from the technical inputs \nprovided. \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  non  government  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \n \nThere will be day-to-day interaction between the technical staff in the involved ministries and the consultants. \nOccasionally, workshops based on the needs expressed will be organized. The PPTA is also allocating a budget for a \nsenior external advisory panel, composed of senior national experts outside government, to discuss and comment on \nthe various reform options. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n  \n    Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nGiven the limited number of initial stakeholders and the technical nature of the work, C&P will be organized as \nexplained under B.2. \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n \nDecentralization that cuts across sectors can have indirect gender impact through the promotion of participatory \npolicy-making processes in local governments that enable women to have a much greater say in decisions that affect \ntheir lives. LGFGRP 2 is not, however, expected to have any significant direct gender impact, as it stops short of \nparticipatory policy-making processes and is focused on the improvement of fiscal policies and allocations. \n \n2. Does the proposed program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?
