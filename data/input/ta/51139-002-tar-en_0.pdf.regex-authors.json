The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) cluster is designed to complement the \nproposed  loan  of  up  to  $100,000,000  to  Olam  International  Limited  (OIL)  and  two  of  its \nsubsidiaries. The loan will support the $223 million capex and expansion plan of OIL and its \nsubsidiaries (Olam) over the 2017-2019 period and invest in Olam\u2019s midstream processing assets \nand permanent working capital for smallholder farmer supply in Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Papua \nNew  Guinea  (PNG),  and  Viet  Nam.1 The  project  will  promote  inclusive  and  sustainable \nagricultural value chains with higher local value addition in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. \n \n2.  The TA cluster grant will complement the loan by providing capacity building support to \n20,000 smallholder coffee farmers that Olam sources from across, Indonesia, PNG, Timor-Leste, \nand Viet Nam. The TA cluster will help smallholder coffee farmers fully benefit from their inclusion \nin  the coffee  value  chain  by  improving the  productivity  and  quality  of  crops,  and  meeting \ninternational certification standards. The TA cluster will also ensure that these farmers are better \nprepared to cope with the negative consequences of climate change. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Analysis of Key Issues \n \n3.  Smallholder coffee farmers. Coffee is a key sector in Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Viet Nam, \nand PNG, but primarily characterized by unorganized, small-scale farming. The vast majority of \ncoffee produced in Indonesia and Viet Nam, the second and third largest coffee producing \ncountries, is grown by smallholders on farms averaging one hectare whose livelihoods depend \non a successful coffee crop. While coffee is Timor-Leste\u2019s largest non-oil export and is grown by \n38% of all Timorese households,2 more than half of coffee planted area consists of unproductive \nold trees resulting in low yields.3 In PNG, coffee production, primarily done by smallholders, is \nthe backbone of the rural economy and accounts for 30% of the total labor force.  \n \n4.  Challenges. Smallholder coffee farmers across these countries face common challenges \nthat include lack of access to finance and quality inputs, low yields, lack of storage and market \ninfrastructure, limited local value addition, and dependence on middlemen. In Indonesia, low \nyields (three times lower than that of Viet Nam4) are due to the low penetration of extension \nservices  and  limited  adoption  of  new  technologies  by  smallholder  coffee  farmers.  Coffee \nproduction  in  Timor-Leste  is  de-facto  organic,  but  only  around  25%  of  exports  have  the \ncertifications needed to be sold as a premium organic product. Coffee yields in Timor-Leste are \nalso extremely low (150-200 kg per ha) and there is significant potential to improve livelihoods by \nincreasing productivity, improving quality, and helping coffee farmers to realize additional value \nthrough certification and traceability. In PNG, the quality and productivity of coffee has been \ndeclining and smallholder farmers\u2019 yields are 50-60% below their potential.5 In Viet Nam, the \nconsequences of heavy use of fertilizer and other agro-chemicals range from deforestation and \nfishery resource depletion, to a growing incidence of land degradation and water pollution.6 \n                                                \n1  In order of start dates (see Table 3). \n2  Government of Timor-Leste. 2016.

Climate change is a serious threat to countries in Southeast Asia and \nthe Pacific, especially in the agriculture sector. Indonesia will see temperature increase up to \n3.9\u00b0C and precipitation decrease up to twelve percent by 2100 according to the Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change. Timor-Leste and PNG are the two most vulnerable countries to climate \nchange in the Pacific when measured by economic losses (as proportion of GDP), with losses \nfrom climate change expected to reach 10% of Timor-Leste\u2019s annual GDP and 15% of PNG\u2019s by \n2100.7 Both countries are expected to experience a temperature increase of more than 2.5\u00b0C on \naverage by 2070 (footnote 3). Viet Nam has been listed as one of the five countries that will be \nworst-affected by climate change given its high exposure to floods and storms.8  \n \n6.  Olam Livelihood Charter. The overall framework under which Olam International Limited \nand its subsidiaries (Olam) is providing assistance to smallholder farmers is the Olam Livelihood \nCharter (Charter). Though not a certification standard, Olam assures customers that their product \nis sustainable, traceable, and helping rural communities.9 From 2011 to 2016, 350,000 farmers \nhave come under the Charter (representing 25% of the tonnage sourced from smallholder \nfarmers), and Olam intends to keep increasing this number every year. In Indonesia, less than 1% \nof the smallholder farmers that Olam sources from are in the Charter. In Timor-Leste and PNG, \nnone of smallholder coffee farmers that Olam sources from are in the Charter. In Viet Nam, 10% \nof smallholder farmers that Olam sources from are in the Charter. \n \n7.  Olam Farmer Information System. The Olam Farmer Information System (OFIS) works \nwith smallholder farmers by using mobile technology to survey and register their farms and local \nsocial  infrastructure.  OFIS  is  a  multi-product  platform  that  is  able  to  collect  and  analyze \ntransaction data from the farm onwards, as well as all farmer training records. This data allows \nOlam to give more farmers tailored support including personalized farm management plans that \nhelp farmers track inputs and outputs. Also, a mobile messaging functionality allows users to \ndirectly contact farmers with information such as pricing, weather and agri-tips. OFIS also has full \nInternal Management System (IMS) capability allowing farmer groups and cooperatives to fully \nmanage their organizations. Olam registered 100,000 smallholder farmers in OFIS across 21 \ncountries. In Timor-Leste and PNG, OFIS has not yet been implemented. In Viet Nam and \nIndonesia, 1,600 and 500 farmers, respectively, are registered in OFIS. \n \n8.  Impact on smallholder farmers. The TA cluster will provide support to the smallholder \ncoffee farmers that Olam sources from through training and agricultural extension services that \nimprove productivity and assist with certification. Certifiers that Olam will work with include CAS-\n4C, Alliance for Water Stewardship, Rainforest Alliance, Starbucks C.A.F.E., and UTZ Certified. \nA holistic climate-smart agriculture training program including training sessions, field trials, and \ndemonstration farms will ensure that farmers better cope with the negative consequences of \nclimate change and environmental degradation. The TA cluster will build on the mobile technology \nplatform that Olam is building to ensure that it directly benefits farmers through better access to \nmarket information and personalized training. The TA cluster will help farmers be included in the \nglobal coffee supply chain by helping them adopt sustainable farming practices and increasing \ntheir production and quality, and ultimately, income. \n \nB.  Justification for Cluster Modality \n \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2014. The Economics of Climate Change in the Pacific. Manila. \n8  World Bank. 2010. Vietnam: Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change. Washington DC. \n9 Under the Charter, farmers must receive all of the following assistance: (i) finance, (ii) improved yield, (iii) labor \npractices, (iv) market access, (v) quality, (vi) traceability, (vii) social investment, (viii) environmental impact. \n \n ", "  3 \n \n9.  A cluster TA is being proposed to maximize efficiency of available TASF money and to \nallow for funding across multiple years.  The transaction TA cluster will complement the proposed \nloan of up to $100,000,000 to Olam International Limited and two of its subsidiaries. The start \ndates of the subprojects of the TA cluster are staggered by country (see Table 2) so that lessons \nlearned  from  countries  with  earlier  start  dates  can  be  applied  and  to  accommodate  local \noperational readiness of Olam.     \n \nC.  Outcome and Outputs  \n \n10.  Impacts and outcome of the TA cluster are in line with the financing project. Impacts are: \n(i) double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers through inputs, \nknowledge, markets, and opportunities for value addition and non-farm employment, (ii) ensure \nsustainable food production systems and implement resilient agricultural practices that increase \nproductivity  and  production,  that  help  maintain  ecosystems,  that  strengthen  capacity  for \nadaptation to climate change, and (iii) significant increase in the exports of developing countries. \nThe major outputs and activities are summarized in Table 1.  \n \nTable 1: Summary of Major Outputs and Activities \nMajor Outputs  Key Activities \n1.

Cost and Indicative Financing \n \n11.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $3,000,000, of which $2,600,000 will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-6) and  $400,000, for the \ncomponents related to climate change adaptation, will be financed by the Canadian Climate Fund \nfor  the  Private  Sector  in  Asia  under  the  Clean  Energy  Financing  Partnership  Facility  and \nadministered by ADB. Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements will be presented in \neach TA subproject proposal submitted for approval.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  ADB will administer the TA from December 2017 to September 2021, with start dates and \nduration for each subproject indicated in Table 3. Olam will be the recipient of the TA cluster as \nOlam is best positioned to coordinate the work of the consulting firms and share learning with \nfarmers, the government, and other stakeholders in the project countries. Olam has the financial \nand administrative capacity to provide the required in-kind contributions (such as staff time, \ndomestic transportation, and office and housing accommodation) to the consultants and ensure \nsuccessful implementation of the TA cluster. Each TA subproject proposal will be submitted for \napproval to the Director General of the Private Sector Operations Department, in accordance with \nthe business process for transaction TA cluster processing. Subproject activities will start only \nafter the project concept of the corresponding ensuing project is approved by ADB. Olam and \nADB have agreed to the terms of a draft TA cluster implementation agreement. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative  December 2017\u2013September 2021 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  Olam \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Firm:  Inclusive and Climate  Quality and Cost-Based  $750,000 \nResilient Coffee Value Chain   Selection \nSubproject 1: Indonesia  \n  Firm:  Inclusive and Climate  Quality and Cost-Based  $1,200,000 \nResilient Coffee Value Chain   Selection \nSubproject 2:  Timor-Leste \n  Firm:  Inclusive and Climate  Quality and Cost-Based  $750,000 \nResilient Coffee Value Chain   Selection \nSubproject 3:  Viet-Nam \n  Firm:  Inclusive and Climate  Quality and Cost-Based  $300,000 \nResilient Coffee Value Chain   Selection \nSubproject 4:  PNG \nAdvance contracting  Use of advanced contracting will be specified in each subproject proposal.

Subprojects. The TA cluster will be implemented through four subprojects as described \nin Table 3. Each subproject will be designed in accordance with the general output descriptions \nas and when needed during the implementation period.   \n ", "  5 \n \nTable 3: Indicative Implementation Period and Budget Allocation for Subprojects \nItem  Subproject Title  Implementation Period  Budget \nSubproject 1  Indonesia   December 2017\u2013September 2020  $750,000 \nSubproject 2  Timor-Leste  April 2018\u2013September 2020  $1,200,000 \nSubproject 3  Viet Nam  October 2018\u2013March 2020  $750,000 \nSubproject 4  Papua New Guinea  April 2019\u2013September 2021  $300,000 \nSources: Olam; Asian Development Bank. \n \n14.  The TA will be carried out by up to four consulting firms (one per each subproject), who \nwill be engaged in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and the associated project administration instructions and/or staff instructions. Each contract \nwill be a performance-based contract.10 Quality- and cost-based selection, with 80:20 weighting, \nand Full Technical Proposals will be used for the recruitment of the consulting firms. Advance \naction for the recruitment of the consulting firms will occur. The estimated cost and requisite fields \nof expertise are indicative and estimates will be finalized prior to approval of each TA subproject. \n \n15.  The consulting firms will be in charge of procuring the equipment required for the TA.11 \nGiven the small size of the equipment package, the anticipated method of procurement is Request \nfor Quotations. Upon TA completion, equipment will be turned over to its users (Olam or the \nfarmers). The consulting firms will also be in charge of administering trainings and conducting \nsurveys.  \n \n16.  ADB and Olam will form a TA task force comprising representatives from ADB and Olam, \nand consultants from the consulting firms to be hired. The task force will meet regularly to assess \nthe progress of the assistance, and will also share information with the respective focal points for \nthe Agriculture and Natural Resources sector in ADB\u2019s Resident Missions in the project countries.  \n \n17.  In addition to the indicators in the Revised Design and Monitoring Framework, the \nfollowing indicator will be monitored for reporting requirements of the Canadian Climate Fund for \nthe Private Sector in Asia under ADB\u2019s Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility: number of \nhectares of land under climate resilient conservation, rehabilitation, or sustainable management. \n \nIII.

", "1 \n \nTerms of Reference for Consultants \n \nInclusive and Climate Resilient Coffee Value Chain  \nPerformance-Based Terms of Reference \nFor Output-based Contract \n \nBackground: \nCoffee is an important sector in Timor-Leste, Indonesia, Viet Nam, and PNG, but primarily \ncharacterized by unorganized, small-scale farming. While coffee is Timor-Leste\u2019s largest non-oil \nexport and is grown by 38%1 of all Timorese households, more than half of the coffee planted \narea consists of unproductive old trees resulting in low yields.2 Coffee production in Timor-Leste \nis de-facto organic, but only around 25% of exports have certification. Several companies and \nNGO-supported programs have established systems that ensure some degree of traceability of \ncoffees from farm-gate to export. However, most coffee exports pass through trader networks and \nare not traceable to the farm level. In PNG, coffee production is also the backbone of the rural \neconomy and accounts for 30% of the total labor force. The vast majority of coffee produced in \nIndonesia and Viet Nam, the second and third largest coffee producing countries, is grown by \nsmallholders on farms averaging around one hectare whose livelihoods depend on a successful \ncoffee crop.  \n \nSmallholder coffee farmers across these countries face common challenges that include lack of \naccess to finance and quality inputs, low yields, lack of storage and market infrastructure, limited \nlocal value addition, and dependence on middlemen. Coffee production in Timor-Leste, despite \nhaving one of the lowest yields in the world (150-200 kg per ha), is de-facto organic, but only \naround 25% of exports have certification. In PNG, the quality and productivity of coffee has been \ndeclining and smallholder farmers\u2019 yields are 50-60% below their potential.3 In Viet Nam, the \nconsequences of heavy use of fertilizer and other agro-chemicals range from deforestation and \nfishery resource depletion, to a growing incidence of land degradation and water pollution.4 In \nIndonesia, low yields (three times lower than that of Viet Nam5) are due to the penetration rate of \nextension services and better technologies being very low among smallholder coffee farmers. \n \nClimate change is a serious threat to countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific, especially in \nthe agriculture sector. Timor-Leste and PNG are the two most vulnerable countries to climate \nchange in the Pacific with economic losses from climate change expected to reach 15% of PNG\u2019s \nannual gross domestic product and 10% of Timor-Leste\u2019s by 2100.6 Both countries are expected \nto experience a temperature increase of more than 2.5\u00b0C on average by 2070 (footnote 3). Viet \nNam has been listed by the World Bank as one of the five countries that will be worst-affected by \nclimate change given its high exposure to floods and storms, and the fact that two of its most \nimportant economic sectors \u2013 industry and agriculture \u2013 are located in coastal lowlands and \ndeltas.7 Indonesia, the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the developing world after \nChina and India, will see temperature increase up to 3.9\u00b0C and precipitation decrease up to twelve \npercent by 2100 according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.  \n                                                \n1  Government of Timor-Leste. 2016.

Certification may be a suitable tool to achieve this in some cases. \nA holistic climate-smart agriculture training program including training sessions, field trials, and \ndemonstration farms will ensure that farmers better cope with the negative consequences of \nclimate change. The TA will build on the mobile technology platform that Olam is building (OFIS) \nto ensure that it directly benefits farmers by  personalized  assessment (annual), training, planning \nand better access to market information. The TA will also encourage implementation of coffee \ngrading and quality based pricing among the farmer groups. The TA will help connect farmers \ndirectly to potential customers of certified conventional and specialty coffees which should help \nfarmers realize better value just because of the premiums involved. The use of OFIS improves \ninformation on (potential) farmer production and assists with traceability, allowing Olam to offer \nlarger, more secure coffee volumes to customers \u2013 which in turn results in coffee sales becoming \na more secure and lucrative livelihood option for farmers.  \n \nThe TA will also encourage institution building and establishment of industry standards in select \ncountries  through  the  development  of  coffee  grading  systems  and  unified  information \nmanagement system. The TA is a piggyback TA which will help realize the projected impact of \nthe financing project. The TA will help farmers be included in the global coffee supply chain by \nhelping them adopt sustainable farming practices and increasing their production and quality, and \nultimately, income. \n \nA.  Scope of Service \nThe project will be designed around the registration of 20,000 new farmers into the Olam Farmer \nInformation System (OFIS). This requires building on-the-gournd relationships with farmers and \ncollecting data through a baseline and annual surveys. Information collected should be used to \ndesign training programs including Good Agricultural Practices, Integrated Pest Management, \nand Climate Smart Agriculture. The setting up and running of a series of coffee demo plots will \nprovide accurate information on local coffee growing conditions, thus informing training content \nand providing training sites for farmers.  \nFarm level demonstration plots will be broadly modelled a World Coffee Research methodology \nbeing used locally, with the following characteristics:  \n\u2022  Located on individual farmers\u2019 land and broadly representative of size / growing conditions \nfaced by other farmers in the immediate vicinity;  \n\u2022  Managed according to a design that is centrally coordinated and that involves \u2018side-by-\nside\u2019 application of different treatments / practices.  \n\u2022  Supported by careful data collection and monitoring to enable clear evaluation of the \neconomic returns of different \u2018improvements\u2019 or changes in farming practices.  \n\u2022  Providing clear visual evidence to nearby farmers, and micro-data for more aggregated \nanalysis.  \nOFIS will be used to generate individual farm management plans and the project will supply inputs \nand advice to implement these effectively. Improvements in productivity, coffee quality and farmer \nlivelihoods are key measures of success. (Organic) certification and/or OLC certification may be \nuseful tools for delivering/measuring these. Each project country (i.e., Timor-Leste, PNG, Viet \nNam, Indonesia) will have a separate contract. For efficiency, consulting firms are encouraged to \nbid for more than one of the four contacts. \n ", "3 \n \nThe firm will report to the ADB project officer through the assignment team leader and will perform \nthe following: \n1.
