INTRODUCTION \n1.  Timor-Leste has requested assistance from its development partners to improve  its \neconomic integration with Asia. The technical assistance (TA) will respond to this request by \nhelping Timor-Leste prepare for membership of regional economic integration (REI) initiatives, \nincluding the economic pillar of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).1 Fact-\nfinding took place in July 2012. The Government of Timor-Leste concurs with the TA\u2019s impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreference.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Timor-Leste has joined the ranks of fast-growing Asian and Pacific economies. Spurred \non  by  a  large  increase  in  government  expenditure  funded  from  petroleum  revenue, \nnonpetroleum gross domestic product grew at an annual average rate of 11.7% over 2007\u2013\n2011. Projections point to Timor-Leste\u2019s potential to sustain an internationally high rate of \neconomic growth.4 Realizing this potential, and the associated development benefits, requires a \ntransition from the current public sector-led economy to one that is led by a diversified private \nsector. This requires a large increase in private investment, including foreign investment.    \n3.  REI can make an important contribution to this economic transition. Economic trends in \nAsia are creating space in regional product, factor, and labor markets that emerging economies, \nsuch as Timor-Leste, can benefit from. Key Asian economies are reducing their dependence on \nexports and reorienting toward domestic and regional demand. Asia\u2019s expanding middle class is \nalso adding to regional demand. At the same time, the aging of Asia\u2019s population and slower \ngrowth in labor supply in key economies are creating opportunities for countries such as Timor-\nLeste that have young populations and surplus labor.5 \n4.  The Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan, 2011\u20132030 reaffirmed a long-standing \ncommitment to regional integration.6 This commitment recognizes the opportunities that regional \nfora provide to pursue the nations\u2019 economic, security, and sociocultural aspirations. Timor-\nLeste secured membership of the ASEAN Regional Forum in July 2005, signed the ASEAN \nTreaty on Amity and Co-operation in 2007, and applied for ASEAN membership in March 2011. \nThe government has expressed its hopes that ascension to ASEAN membership can proceed \nquickly,  but  concerns  expressed  about  Timor-Leste\u2019s  readiness  to  join  by  some  current \nmembers are stalling progress. The time frame for eventual membership remains unclear, but \nundertaking  actions  to  bring  Timor-Leste  into  compliance  with  prerequisites  for  ASEAN \nmembership\u2014the focus of the TA\u2014will advance this process. \n                                                \n1  In helping Timor-Leste strengthen regional economic integration, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is not taking \na view on Timor-Leste\u2019s readiness or otherwise to join ASEAN. Although membership in ASEAN is the focus of the \ncountry\u2019s current efforts in the area of regional economic integration, efforts related to ASEAN would also foster the \ncountry\u2019s  integration  via  other  regional  bodies  (e.g.,  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation,  the  World  Trade \nOrganization, and bilateral trade agreement with other countries). \n2  The embrace of the goals of the TA within the government\u2019s development plans is clear from the Program of the \nFifth Constitutional Government (2012), the Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan 2011\u20132030 (2011), the \nBackground Paper to the Timor-Leste and Development Partners Meeting (2010), and the Treaty of Amity and \nCooperation with ASEAN (2007). \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 November 2012. \n4  ADB. 2011.

Keynote Speech to the 2011 Timor-\nLeste Development Partners Meeting. Dili (July). \n6  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011. Timor-Leste Strategic Development Plan, 2011\u20132030. Dili (July). \n ", "2   \n5.  Timor-Leste has strong economic ties with ASEAN member countries and the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), Japan, and the Republic of Korea. In 2011, almost 90% of Timor-\nLeste\u2019s merchandise imports were sourced from Asia, including about 40% from Indonesia and \n25% from the PRC. Timorese are building their skills in training courses and employment \nprograms  throughout  Asia,  especially  in  the  PRC,  Indonesia,  and  the  Republic  of  Korea. \nInvestors  and  tourists  are  being  encouraged  by  an  expanding  network  of  embassies  and \nconsulates, which now covers nine Asian nations. \n6.  Smooth integration with Asia presents many challenges for the still young nation.7 While \nTimor-Leste has an open economy with few barriers to investment, trade, and skilled labor \nmigration, time is required to meet the standards of integration achieved elsewhere in Asia. Key \nrequirements of the ASEAN Economic Community, such as streamlined customs systems and \ninvestment facilitation, are not yet in place. Government agencies and their staff are still learning \nwhat is required to ensure effective REI, and how best to manage engagements in regional \ndialogues on trade and investment, finance, tourism, food security, and other economic issues. \n7.  At the 19th ASEAN Summit held in November 2011, the ASEAN Coordinating Council \nwas tasked to discuss all relevant aspects related to Timor-Leste\u2019s application for ASEAN \nmembership as well as possible implications for ASEAN.8 A working group has since been \nestablished to recommend to the ASEAN Coordinating Council on Timor-Leste\u2019s ability to meet \nthe requirements of Article 6 of the ASEAN Charter, which includes a requirement that a country \nhave the ability to carry out membership obligations. \n8.  Timor-Leste\u2019s efforts to join ASEAN are led by the secretary of state for ASEAN affairs, \nas  part  of  the foreign affairs  portfolio.  Day-to-day  activities  are  managed  by  the  Regional \nIntegration Directorate of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA). The directorate includes an \nASEAN National Secretariat, which coordinates ASEAN focal points nominated in central and \nline agencies. While MOFA is the lead on all aspects of regional integration, most of the specific \nactions required are the responsibility of other agencies. A high level of understanding and \ncooperation is needed across government agencies to prepare for a deeper REI with Asia. \n9.  The pursuit of ASEAN membership is the immediate focus of Timor-Leste\u2019s efforts to \nstrengthen its REI. The range of related preparations is wide, and covers membership of a \nnumber of ASEAN-linked initiatives.9 Success in preparing for ASEAN membership will provide \na foundation for pursuit of engagement in other REI initiatives. \n10.  Timor-Leste  appreciates  the contributions  planned  under the TA. The government\u2019s \npriority is to secure assistance from experts with deep, practical experience in Asia\u2019s  REI \ninitiatives; and to improve linkages with regional organizations and partner country officials.  \n11.  The government recognizes the unique role of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \nREI and has asked for continuing support in this area. ADB\u2019s Timor-Leste country partnership \nstrategy,  2011\u20132015  and  country  operations  business  plan,  2011\u20132013  provided  for  such \nsupport, and recognized that special attention should be paid to ties with Southeast Asia.10 \n                                                \n7  J.

", "  3 \nSuch  support  needs  to  be  coordinated  closely  with  other  development  partners  active  in \nsupporting Timor-Leste on REI, most notably the governments of Indonesia and Japan. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA is enhanced REI with Asia. Performance will be measured by the \ngrowth of trade with and investment from ASEAN+3 countries. The outcome will be an improved \nability to carry out the obligations of membership of REI initiatives, with performance to be \nmeasured by confirmation by the ASEAN Secretariat that Timor-Leste has met at least half of \nthe country-specific actions of the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint.11 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The  TA  plans  three  outputs:  (i)  improved  understanding  of  the  implications  of \nmembership of regional initiatives, (ii) an enhanced policy framework for REI, and (iii) improved \ncommunication with regional organizations and partner countries. Focus on measures related to \nTimor-Leste\u2019s application for ASEAN will ensure the TA has an immediate and demand-driven \nfocus, but the TA will deliver much broader benefits that can quickly flow through to improve \nintegration with other countries and organizations. \n14.  The TA will follow on two short studies taking place over the second half of 2012. ADB\u2019s \nOffice  of  Regional  Economic  Integration  is  undertaking  a  study  on  behalf  of  the  ASEAN \nSecretariat in Jakarta that will address Timor-Leste\u2019s readiness to join ASEAN.12 This study will \ninform  the  considerations  of  the  ASEAN  Coordinating  Council,  and  be  confidential  to  the \nASEAN Secretariat. It will, nonetheless, assist dialogue with Timor-Leste on the actions required \nto prepare for membership of ASEAN through the technical assessments it will produce and the \ninternal  discussions  of  these  within  Timor-Leste  and  ASEAN  member  countries.  Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency (JICA) is supporting a study of the costs and benefits of \nASEAN  membership  and  the  requirements  of  membership.  The  JICA  study  will  involve \nextensive discussion with Timor-Leste agencies. \n15.  The dialogue emerging from these two studies will form the basis of a prioritized REI \naction plan, which will be prepared with ADB assistance.13 The TA will help implement this \naction plan by building capacity and providing technical support needed to complete specific \nactions. It will help build the systems and processes needed within the government to address \nthe challenges raised by the REI. Capacity will be built at an individual level by providing \nmentoring support and training, and facilitating an engagement in knowledge-sharing events. \n16.  The TA will be implemented in accordance with the REI action plan to reduce gaps in the \nfollowing: \n(i)  Understanding that REI\u2013multilateral partnerships such as ASEAN are new to \nTimor-Leste\u2014an understanding of REI initiatives across stakeholders, including \nthe benefits and obligations of membership in regional organizations, will be \nfostered through TA support. This will include support for awareness-raising, \nknowledge-sharing, and capacity development events. The TA will also help put \n                                                \n11 Some 175 county-specific actions are set out in the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint. The detailed actions \nare listed in ASEAN. 2008. ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint. Jakarta: ASEAN Secretariat (January). \n12 The study is being undertaken through ADB. 2009.

Manila (TA 7503-REG). \n ", "4   \nin place the coordination arrangements needed between government agencies. \n(ii)  REI policy frameworks\u2014membership in regional fora, such as ASEAN, brings a \nlarge number of technical requirements (e.g., the ASEAN Economic Community \nBlueprint identifies 175 separate actions to be undertaken by 2015) (footnote 11). \nThe  TA  will  provide  specialist  inputs  to  help  address  gaps  in  Timor-Leste\u2019s \npolicies relevant to REI (e.g., competition policy, consumer protection, intellectual \nproperty policy) that needed to bring the country into compliance with ASEAN \npolicy mandates. \n(iii)  Communication with regional organizations and partner countries\u2014opportunities \nwill be provided for Timor-Leste to seek guidance on the process for joining \nASEAN and related initiatives, and to learn from the experience of their members. \nThe  TA  will  improve  channels  for  effective  communication  though  various \nactivities to improve information exchange related to REI.14 \n \n17.  Key assumptions of the TA are that Timor-Leste is brought into the ASEAN Economic \nCommunity process of the ASEAN Secretariat, and that Timor-Leste\u2019s application for ASEAN \nmembership retains broad-based internal support. The TA also assumes adequate government \nfunding for staff travel to dialogue events with members of regional initiatives, and a high-level \nacceptance of an open and transparent approach to preparing for membership of regional \ninitiatives. The key risks are that other development priorities draw attention away from REI, or \nthat high staff turnover hampers the sustainability of support. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $900,000, of which $850,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of  office  accommodation,  staff,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be the executing agency and provide overall guidance to the TA, and ensure \nalignment with the government\u2019s plans. MOFA\u2019s Regional Integration Directorate will lead the \nTA on a day-to-day basis. MOFA will be the implementing agency and administer training, \nseminars, and conferences. To defray the costs of these activities, an advance payment facility \nwill be established. ADB\u2019s Special Office in Timor-Leste will be its focal point for the TA, and \noversee and assist the directorate in managing the advance payment facility. \n20.  The TA will require up to 95 person-months of consulting services, provided by a team \nleader  (international,  up  to  24 months);  a  deputy  team  leader  (national,  24  months);  lead \nadvisers  (2  international  advisers  of  up  to  4  months  each);  technical  specialists  (up  to \n5 international positions of up to 3 months each); and a communication and liaison officer \n(national, 24 months). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n21.  A consultant team will be established within the Regional Integration Directorate of \nMOFA. The TA team leader and deputy team leader will assist the directorate with the detailed \nupdating and implementation of priority initiatives of the established REI action plans and a \nsupporting  capacity  development  plan.  They  will  also  coordinate  the  input  of  (i)  two  lead \n                                                \n14 Communication-enhancing efforts could include national roundtables and stakeholder workshops. Detailed plans to \nimprove communication will be developed with the government early in TA implementation once the precise areas \nof work in which the TA will focus its efforts are clarified. ", "  5 \nadvisers, who will meet periodically in Timor-Leste to provide high-level guidance to ministers \nand senior officials on REI;15 and (ii) short-term technical specialists, who will contribute specific \nexpertise needed to design and implement priority initiatives of the REI action plan.16 \n22.  International and national consultants contracted to provide TA inputs will be selected \nand engaged by ADB on an individual basis in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  to  ensure  flexibility  and  efficiency  in \nrecruitment.17 TA disbursements will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement of equipment, if \nany, will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n23.  The team leader and deputy team leader will help the Regional Integration Directorate \nsecure support from ASEAN and ASEAN+3 member countries and regional organizations for \nthe sharing of their experience. The TA will be open to funding the cost of travel of staff from \nmember countries and regional organizations visiting Timor-Leste for knowledge sharing and \ncapacity  development  events  included  in  the  REI  action  plan.  This  will  help  deepen  an \nestablished practice of sharing expertise that allows Timor-Leste to quickly tap into the latest \ndevelopments and benefit from the hands-on experience of partners. \n24.  The  TA  will  work  closely  with  other  development  partner-supported  activities,  most \nnotably with JICA and the Government of Indonesia. The team leader and deputy team leader \nTA will help the Regional Integration Directorate coordinate development partner support. A \ncoordination committee chaired by the Regional Integration Directorate, with representatives \nfrom  JICA,  ADB,  and  other  partners  active  in  REI  initiatives,  will  be  established  to  guide \ndevelopment partner support related to REI, and be assisted by the TA team leader and deputy \nteam  leader.  TA  staff  will  also  help  the  directorate  access  contributions  from  the  many \ndevelopment partner-funded technical advisers working with government agencies that can help \nprepare Timor-Leste to join regional initiatives (e.g., in the Customs service). \n25.  The TA will commence on 1 January 2013 and be completed on 31 December 2014. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $850,000 to the Government \nof Timor-Leste to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nPreparing for Regional Economic Integration, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n15 JICA is considering providing (and fully funding) a headquarters-based senior expert on regional integration, who, if \nhired, could act as one of the lead advisers. \n16 MOFA will be involved in the selection process. The selected supplier will be asked to submit a combined technical \nand financial proposal, and then be invited to negotiate the contract. Given the small number of potential suppliers \nof  specialist  input  (few  consultants  are  qualified  to  undertake  the  task),  the preparation and  evaluation of \ncompetitive proposals are unjustified, so an institutional supplier will be engaged. Procurement from a regional \nthink tank or institute contracted using ADB\u2019s consultants\u2019 qualifications selection procedures is planned. This \nreflects the small cost of the assignments (estimated to be less than $200,000) and the requirement for highly \nspecialized expertise. \n17 A short-term technical specialist will be recruited under expedited processes in compliance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB and JICA have discussed the possibility of \nJICA providing a lead adviser to facilitate coordination between the TA and JICA REI efforts. JICA would be \ncharged with recruitment of the lead adviser, whose recruitment would not be subject to ADB\u2019s guidelines on \nconsultant recruitment. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nDesign   Performance Targets and \na Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines  \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nEnhanced REI  Value of trade with  Trade statistics from  Economic growth remains \nwith Asia  ASEAN+3 countries grows  the National  high \nfaster than total trade from  Directorate of  Timor-Leste\u2019s investment \n2014 to 2016 (2012  Statistics  climate is internationally \nbaseline: No)    competitive \n  Ministry of Trade,   \nOne major private  Tourism, and  Risk \ninvestment (more than $50  Industry\u2019s reports and  Slower growth in the regional \nmillion) from ASEAN+3  databases  economy \ncountries commences \nconstruction during 2014\u2013\n2016 (2012 baseline: 0) \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved ability  Confirmation by the ASEAN  ASEAN Economic  Timor-Leste is brought into \nby Timor-Leste to  Secretariat that Timor-Leste  Community Blueprint  the ASEAN Economic \ncarry out the  has met at least half the  monitoring reports  Community process of the \nobligations of  country-specific actions of  from the ASEAN  ASEAN Secretariat \nmembership of  the ASEAN Economic  Secretariat  Timor-Leste\u2019s application for \nREI initiatives  Community Blueprint by the  Material released at  ASEAN membership retains \nend of 2015 (2012 baseline:  awareness raising  broad-based, internal \n0%)  events  support \n   \nRisk \n(i)  Lower tariffs on imports;  Government websites \nOther development priorities \n(ii) Reduction of nontariff  or information officers \ndraw attention away from \nbarriers to free flow of goods;   \nREI \n(iii) Adopt rules of origin that  Government updates \nfoster trade and investment;  on the application for \nand  membership of REI \n(iv) Develop simple,  initiatives, including \nharmonized and  ASEAN \nstandardized trade and \ncustoms, processes, and \nprocedures. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
