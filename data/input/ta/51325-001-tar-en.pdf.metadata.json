INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support selected developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2014Bangladesh, Indonesia, and \nthe Philippines\u2014to strengthen their capacity to design and implement investment projects that \nstrengthen the resilience of the urban poor, thereby advancing inclusive urban development. The \nsupport  to  DMCs  will  include  (i)  country  studies  to  identify  investment  opportunities  for \nstrengthening resilience of the urban poor women and men, (ii) improved skills for using climate \nchange and disaster risk information for developing resilience-building investments targeted at \nthe urban poor, and (iii) project preparatory work with an explicit focus on strengthening the \nresilience of the urban poor.  \n \n2.  The proposed technical assistance outputs are aligned with the development priorities of \nthe DMCs, as reflected in their respective national development plans, and with ADB country \npartnership  strategies.1 The  technical  assistance  will  support  the  implementation  of  ADB\u2019s \nClimate  Change  Operational  Framework,2 which  identifies  urban  resilience  as  one  of  the \npriorities.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The lives of people in urban areas in Asia and the Pacific region have significantly \nimproved in the last decade. However, for a sizable fraction of the urban population, the threat of \npoverty is far from over.4 The poor and particularly women, rely on fewer and more vulnerable \nassets and basic services, have limited access to finance, depend on informal livelihoods, have \nlimited access to information, and are often left out from formal decision-making processes. \nConsequently, the urban poor are disproportionately exposed to various shocks and stresses\u2014\nincluding the ones triggered by natural hazards and climate change\u2014which result in loss of life, \ndamage to assets, disruption of livelihoods, and loss of income. In many cases, these effects may \nrequire the urban poor to adopt negative coping strategies, that may impact their long-term well-\nbeing and further affect their poverty level. Thus, poverty and climate and disaster risks are closely \ninterrelated: poverty contributing to high disaster and climate risks, and disaster and climate risks \nkeeping people in poverty.5 The impacts of climate change and disasters also extend to the local \ngovernments, which suffer the increased burden of supporting a post-disaster response.  \n \n4.  A key cause of the disproportionate impact faced by the urban poor women and men is \nthe limited capacity of DMCs for strengthening resilience. This is due to limited (i) skills on using \nrisk  information  for  designing  pro-poor  resilience-building  investments,  (ii)  knowledge  of \nopportunities provided by different sectors in strengthening the resilience of the urban poor, and \n(iii) investments in resilience-building with an explicit focus on the urban poor. Resilience building \n                                                \n1  Government of Bangladesh, Planning Commission. 2015. Seventh Five-Year Plan, 2016\u20132020.

Manila \n3  The technical assistance first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 December 2017. \n4  The urban poverty headcount ratio based on national poverty lines is 21.3% for Bangladesh (2010), 8.3% for \nIndonesia (2014), and 13.0% for the Philippines (2012).

Washington DC. \n ", "2   \n \nmay  include  investments  in  social  protection 6  (targeting  poor  households),  which  offer \nopportunities to strengthen livelihoods and skills and provide safety nets; investments using \ncommunity-driven development (CDD) approaches7 (targeting poor communities), to deliver \nresilient infrastructure; and investments in urban governance8 (targeting urban local bodies), to \nintegrate  resilience  considerations  in  decentralized  processes.  For  example,  after Typhoon \nYolanda, the Philippines used the existing conditional cash transfer system to release the \nequivalent of about $12.5 million in emergency funding. However, lessons learned reveal that \nintroducing such responsive features requires advance planning, including ensuring access to \nfinancing required for scaling up. CDD projects have been used in the region to deliver post-\ndisaster reconstruction related, such as after the 2004 tsunami in Indonesia. However, the wider \npotential for strengthening resilience through risk-informed targeting of CDD projects and using \nlocalized  risk  information  to  inform  the  selection,  location,  and  construction  of  community \ninfrastructure subprojects remains limited. Hence, investments to strengthen urban governance \nwith an explicit focus on resilience outcomes targeted at the poor remain limited.  \n \n5.  The DMCs recognize such gaps. For example, the Philippine Development Plan, 2017\u2013\n2022, while acknowledging the contribution of the conditional cash transfer program to reducing \npoverty also highlights that the outcome would have been more pronounced if households were \nmore resilient.9 Accordingly, the plan calls for the need to design social protection programs based \non the systematic understanding of risk. The National Medium-Term Development Plan, 2015\u2013\n2019 of Indonesia includes a target to meet 100% sanitation services (wastewater, drainage, and \nsolid waste management) by 2019, a significant portion of which will be delivered through CDD \napproaches.10 Strengthening local governments and resilience is one of the priorities of the \nSeventh Five-Year Plan of the Government of Bangladesh.11  \n \n6.  Individually,  social  protection  measures,  CDD  approaches,  and  improved  local \ngovernance each provides distinct opportunities to strengthen resilience. When combined into a \nholistic approach to strengthening resilience, they can address issues related to livelihoods, \nhousehold assets, community infrastructure, and governance. Such an approach echoes with \nlessons from ADB projects on strengthening resilience, which highlight the importance of (i) \nsupporting approaches that allow communities, especially women, to lead resilience interventions \nin  partnerships  with  local  governments;  (ii)  undertaking  investments  at  different  levels\u2014\nhouseholds, communities, and local governments\u2014and including a suite of measures aimed at \nimproving basic services, land administration system, livelihoods, human capital, and safety nets; \nand (iii) engaging DMC agencies in upstream work on pro-poor resilience building, thereby \ncreating the enabling environment for the city governments and communities to act.12 \n                                                \n6  Social protection programs are used in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and the Philippines for supporting households to \nmanage a range of covariate shocks.  \n7  Community-driven development (CDD) approaches are being used to improve community-level infrastructure in \nBangladesh, Indonesia, and the Philippines. CDD programs are ideal for strengthening resilience because they allow \nthe adoption of a participatory process to identify local risks and address the root causes of vulnerability by improving \nthe standards of the infrastructure and adopting risk-informed livelihoods. \n8  Strengthening governance is critical for building resilience for the urban poor. For example, community participation \nin projects is critical to ensure that local risk issues are addressed; gender equity is essential for addressing risk \nissues related to the social roles of women; financial management is important to ensure that resources are allocated \nin a risk-informed manner; and accountability and transparency are critical to ensure that the poor and most \nvulnerable are targeted and will benefit from development interventions. \n9  Government of the Philippines. 2017.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The technical assistance is aligned with the following impact: resilience of cities enhanced \n(Sustainable Development Goal 11).13 The technical assistance will have the following outcome: \nDMC capacity for resilience-building investments targeted at the urban poor improved.14 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Country studies to identify opportunities for strengthening the resilience \nof the urban poor completed. Under this output, the project team will (i) analyze national or \nregional urban poverty in the context of climate and disaster risk; (ii) review urban poverty \nreduction programs and their linkages with social protection, community-driven development, and \nurban local governance programs to identify lessons learned and challenges in the context of \nstrengthening resilience; (iii) identify opportunities for strengthening the resilience of the urban \npoor  through  a  portfolio  of  investments  targeted  at  households,  community,  and  local \ngovernments; and (iv) provide recommendations for potential investment projects with an explicit \nfocus  on  strengthening  the  resilience  of  the  urban  poor,  including  recommendations  for \nappropriate financing modality (such as project financing vs. results-based lending). \n \n9.  Activities under output 1 will include a review of good practices of government programs \nfor strengthening resilience of urban poor; close consultation with DMC agencies responsible for \nplanning and finance, urban development, climate change, disaster risk management, social \nprotection, and governance; consultations with selected city governments; and discussions with \ndevelopment partners and civil society organizations. The activities will also  include a risk \nassessment  to better understand linkages between current and future climate and disaster risk \nand urban poverty to improve geographical targeting of future investments on urban poverty \nreduction; and social and poverty assessments of urban poor households to understand issues \n(land,  housing,  community  infrastructure,  livelihoods,  access to  information,  participation  of \nwomen and vulnerable population in decision-making, access to finance) in the context of \nresilience. The recommendations emerging from the output will inform discussions in the context \nof national or regional development plans, country partnership strategies, and country knowledge \nplans.15 \n \n                                                \nCluster Subprojects (October\u2013December 2014).

Further, in the case of the Philippines, the discussions with the Department of Social Welfare and Development \nhighlighted that the output can contribute to the successor program of the National Community-driven Development \nProgram, and resilience-related programs of development partners, such as community-based disaster response \nprogram supported by the Government of Australia. The discussion with Bangladesh government highlighted that \noutput 1 could support the Dhaka Region Development Authority or other planning institutions in preparation of the \nurban programs. \n ", "4   \n \n10.  Output 2: Skills for using climate change and disaster risk information for designing \npro-poor resilience-building investments improved. Based on the recommendations of output \n1, each DMC will identify capacity building activities for implementation under output 2. The \nobjective of the activities will be to strengthen the capacity of DMCs to use climate change and \ndisaster risk information in the design of pro-poor resilience-building investments with a particular \nfocus on (i) understanding climate and disaster risk for improving the targeting of pro-poor \nresilience-building  investment  projects;  (ii)  designing  standards  for  resilient  community \ninfrastructure; and (iii) strengthening partnerships between grassroots organizations, especially \nwomen\u2019s groups and local governments, to create space for communities to lead actions.  \n \n11.  The exact nature of activities will differ in each DMC and will broadly include undertaking \ntraining programs on the use of risk information for designing pro-poor investments in urban areas; \norganizing workshops and consultations to review design standards of community infrastructure; \nundertaking  surveys  to  incorporate  resilience  considerations  in  relevant  databases  (land \nadministration, social protection, and poverty); and developing resilience indicators and collecting \nnecessary baseline. The activities may be implemented nationwide or for specific urban areas, \ndepending on urban poverty trend, the level of climate and disaster risk, the existence of social \nprotection, and/or community-driven development projects.16 \n \n12.  Output  3:  Preparatory  work  for  investment  projects  with  an  explicit  focus  on \nstrengthening the resilience of urban poor supported. Based on the findings of outputs 1 and \n2, this output will contribute to potential transaction technical assistance work in at least two \nselected DMCs for potential investments with an explicit focus on strengthening the resilience of \nthe urban poor. The potential investments could have the primary objective of strengthening the \nresilience of the urban poor or mainstreaming resilience considerations in wider investments in \nurban poverty reduction, social protection in urban areas, women\u2019s empowerment in urban areas, \nCDD in urban areas, and governance and decentralization.17 The activities will include project-\nspecific assessments, analyses, and surveys to support the design of projects.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The technical assistance is estimated to cost $5,000,000, which will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF) under the Urban Financing \nPartnership Facility and administered by ADB.18 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. \n \n14.  Under the UCCRTF Implementation Guidelines, technical assistance funds can be used \nfor consulting services, equipment, and works.19   \n                                                \n16 The activities will draw linkages with ongoing and proposed activities in DMCs, such as the climate change \nprojections being developed by BAPPENAS, Indonesia, and the development of resilient communities\u2019 indicators by \nthe National Economic Development Authority, Philippines. The activities will draw linkages from other initiatives \nsupported by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund, including community-led pilots, a spatial application \nfacility, and the Resilience Academy, which is a consultative workshop to design urban resilience projects \n17 For example, in the Philippines, the output could contribute to potential future phases of ADB-supported Regional \nDevelopment Project in the Philippines (ADB. 2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines 2018\u20132020. \nManila). In Bangladesh, the output could contribute to the TA-Loan Preparing Urban Development Projects proposed \nfor 2019, and the Second Coastal Towns Environmental Infrastructure Improvement Project proposed for 2020 (ADB. \n2017. Country Operations Business Plan: Philippines 2018\u20132020. Manila).  \n18 Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of Switzerland and the United Kingdom. \n19 Works may include (i) economic and sector work; (ii) capacity-building and analytical work; (iii) development and \npreparation of projects for investment; (iv) sharing of project development costs for investment in combination with \nother government, development partner, and commercial funding; (v) transfer of technology, knowledge, and \n ", "  5 \nD.
