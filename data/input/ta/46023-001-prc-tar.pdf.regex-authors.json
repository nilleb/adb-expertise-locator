INTRODUCTION \n1.  In December 2012, during the country program consultation, the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide \ntechnical assistance (TA) to develop innovative bond financing for small and medium-sized \nenterprises (SMEs) and an investor protection mechanism.1 An ADB reconnaissance mission \nvisited the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) in Beijing on 13 August 2013, \nwhere an understanding was reached on the TA impact, outcome, outputs, cost estimates, \nfinancing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for  consultants.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  SMEs  contribute  significantly  to  economic  development  and  to  job  creation.3 They \ncomprise 99% of all enterprises in the PRC, hire 75% of employees, and contribute 58.5% of \ngross domestic product in 2008. However, access to finance remains a key constraint to SME \ndevelopment.  Appropriate  financing  instruments  for  SMEs  vary  according  to  the  stage  of \ndevelopment:  (i)  seed,  (ii)  start-up,  (iii)  early,  (iv)  expansion,  (v)  steadily  growing,  and  \n(vi) mature.4 Apart from bank financing, other financing avenues for SMEs include nonbank \nfinancial institutions, venture capital, and capital markets. Funding instruments for SMEs must \nbe diversified based on SME needs. Under the PRC\u2019s bank-centered financial system,5 capital \nmarket financing is a difficult option for SMEs. \n \n3.  The PRC government has implemented policies to promote bank financing and equity \nfinancing for SMEs. These include establishment of SME credit guarantee companies and \nequity markets designed for SMEs, such as the SME Board, and ChiNext under the Shenzhen \nStock Exchange and Qianhai Equity Exchange.6 SME access to bond markets has remained \nlimited due to underdeveloped high-yield bond markets. Despite government efforts to promote \nSME bonds by introducing (i) the SME collective bond scheme,7 (ii) SME bonds issued by local \ngovernments,8 and (iii) SME private placement bonds,9 the PRC\u2019s corporate bond market is \nmainly dominated by large enterprises; SMEs have only a small share. The PRC Securities Law \nallows  joint-stock  companies  with  net  assets  of  not  less  than  CNY30  million  and  limited \ncorporations with not less than CNY60 million to issue corporate bonds. However by the end of \n                                                \n1  The TA is included in ADB\u2019s Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2013\u20132015. Manila.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 September 2013. \n3  Medium-sized industrial enterprises have a maximum of CNY400 million in assets, CNY300 million in sales, and \n2,000 employees. Small industrial enterprises have a maximum of CNY40 million in assets, CNY30 million in sales, \nand 300 employees. \n4  Shigehiro Shinozaki. 2012. A New Regime of SME Finance in Emerging Asia: Empowering Growth-Oriented SMEs \nto Build Resilient National Economies. ADB Working Paper Series on Regional Economic Integration. Manila. \n5  Typical barriers to accessing bank finance for SMEs include lack of collateral, no business track record, and fragile \nfinancial and management systems.  \n6  An  over-the-counter  equity  trading  platform  for  SMEs  offering  much  looser  listing  requirements  than  main \nexchanges was launched on 30 May 2013. \n7  Issued by three or more SMEs in the interbank bond market with the mode of \u201cone name, respective liability, one \nsecurity, and collective issuance.\u201d Collective bonds outstanding reached CNY13.3 billion as of 30 June 2012.  \n8  Introduced in 2012 as a new class of bonds issued by local governments on behalf of SMEs to limit the buildup of \nrisks in the banking system, but increasing the debt burden of local governments. \n9  Released as a pilot program in May 2012. Private placement bonds are corporate bonds not publicly issued by \nmicro, small, and medium-sized nonlisted enterprises, with a return rate not exceeding three times the coterminous \nbenchmark debt interest rate, and with repayment periods not less than 1 year. Unlike the SME collective notes \nand bonds, which are jointly issued by a group of SMEs, issuance of SME private placement bonds are on an \nindividual name basis and typically carry higher yields.  \n ", "2   \n2010, the average net assets of the major bond issuers only exceeded CNY15 billion. So far, no \nhigh-yield bonds below the BB rating have been introduced; nonfinancial corporate issuers of \nmedium- and long-term bonds have a minimum A rating. High-yield bonds accounted for only \n0.5% of the total issuance in 2010. Developing a sustainable high-yield bond market is critical \nfor providing secure and longer-term financing to SMEs to complement bank financing. \n \n4.  The government recognizes the importance of developing the overall financial system, \nincluding capital markets for improving financial access for SMEs. However, the high-yield bond \nmarket,  when  compared  with  the  government  and  corporate  bond  market,  remains \nunderdeveloped.  It  lacks  an  overall  development  strategy,  a  proper  legal  and  regulatory \nframework, and necessary financial market infrastructure. The development of a high-yield bond \nmarket strategy should be consistent with overall bond market development. It will require a \nthorough study of existing barriers and a well-designed road map. To promote SME bond \nfinancing, the PRC government and self-regulatory agencies have introduced various schemes. \nThe Interbank Traders Association initiated and manages the SME collective note program; the \nMinistry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) initiated the SME collective bond scheme; \nand the CSRC launched the SME private placement bond pilot program in May 2013.The CSRC \nprogram is an innovative attempt to introduce market-oriented high-yield bonds specifically \ndesigned for SMEs. The number of SME bond issuers has reached 331, with the issuance \namount on record reaching CNY41.4 billion, while 210 SMEs have now raised CNY27.0 billion \nthrough  private  bond  issuances.  While  CSRC,  People\u2019s  Bank  of  China,  and  National \nDevelopment and Reform Commission have held regular coordination meetings since 2012, a \nstronger  policy  coordination  and  communication  mechanism  involving  a  wider  group  of \nregulatory authorities is needed, for the effective development of a high-yield bond market for \nSMEs.10  \n5.  An investor protection mechanism is also crucial for developing a high-yield bond market \nfor SMEs. Investor confidence can be established with sound corporate governance standards \nfor  SMEs,  and  a  well-designed  and  well-enforced  legal  system  for  investor  protection.  In \ndifferent jurisdictions, rules protecting investors come from different sources, including company, \nsecurities, bankruptcy, takeover, and competition laws; exchange regulations; and accounting \nstandards. Enforcement of laws is equally important. In most  countries, market regulators, \ncourts, and market participants collectively enforce laws and regulations. The PRC government \nis making significant progress in  developing a legal and regulatory framework for investor \nprotection. CSRC recently established the Investor Protection Bureau to better protect the rights \nand interests of investors in the capital markets. The Bureau is reviewing laws and regulations \nthat protect investors; helping establish an education system; assisting in developing a remedial \nsystem to protect the interests of investors; monitoring the management and operation of the \ncountry\u2019s investor protection fund; and promoting communication and cooperation with other \nfinancial  consumer  protection  organizations.  However,  no  comprehensive  study  has  been \nundertaken on an investor protection mechanism, and  no overall legal system design and \nenforcement strategy have been formulated. The investor protection mechanism needs to be \nassessed comprehensively and strengthened to build investor confidence and develop the high-\nyield bond market. \n \n6.  Aligned  with  the  PRC\u2019s  Twelfth  Five-Year  Plan  for  2011-2015,  the  ADB  Country \nPartnership Strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC identifies inclusive growth as one of the strategic \npillars. The TA directly supports inclusive growth by providing access to finance through bond \nmarkets for SMEs and enhancing investor protection mechanisms.   \n                                                \n10 Including the China Insurance Regulatory Commission and Interbank Traders Association. \n ", "  3 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the TA will be increased access to finance for SMEs. The outcome will be \ndevelopment of a high-yield bond market for SMEs in the PRC. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n8.  The  TA  will  help  the  government  formulate  strategies  and  implement  programs  to \npromote SME access to finance by developing a high-yield bond market and an appropriate \ninvestor protection mechanism. The TA will conduct a comprehensive study of overall SME \nbond  financing  in  the  PRC  and  international  best  practices  to  identify  preconditions  for \nsuccessful development of a high-yield bond market. Based on this study, a road map for \nestablishing  effective  policy  measures  will  be  prepared.  Measures  for  diversifying  and \nexpanding the investor base, building a proper legal framework, and designing an efficient \nregulatory enforcement system will be explored and recommended. The TA will explore  a \npossible investor protection mechanism for a high-yield bond market through a study that draws \non experiences and lessons from advanced economies with different legal systems. Finally, the \nTA  will  provide  capacity  building  activities  for  relevant  authorities  and  promote  knowledge \nsharing through an international conference. \n \n9.  The TA will deliver four major outputs with the following tasks. \n \n(i)  A comprehensive report on innovative SME bond financing. The report will \nprovide  the  background  for  the  development  of  an  effective  high-yield  bond \nmarket for SMEs in the PRC. This will involve review and assessment of the \nexisting corporate bond market in the PRC compared with international best \npractices to identify relevant and useful lessons, and study tours for various \ngovernment counterparties to learn from relevant foreign government authorities \nand bond market participants on how to develop an efficient SME bond market \nand a proper investor protection mechanism.11 The study will result in a report \nand a policy note as knowledge products to be shared with relevant authorities. \n \n(ii)  A road map with specific policy recommendations for development of high-\nyield bond markets, market infrastructure, and an appropriate legal and \nregulatory framework. Activities will include assessment of the overall high-yield \nbond market development strategy, review of the current legal and regulatory \nframework and exploration of necessary steps to improve it, assessment of the \ncurrent  investor  base  for  high-yield  bonds  and  introduction  of  measures  to \ncultivate  and  expand  the  investor  base,  and  analysis  of  relevant  market \ninfrastructure and recommendation of an appropriate model for the PRC. A report \nand a policy note will be produced as knowledge products for relevant authorities. \n \n(iii)  A report on appropriate investor protection mechanisms for a high-yield \nbond  market  and  policy  recommendations.  This will involve reviewing the \nexisting investor protection mechanism in the PRC compared with international \nbest practices and case studies; establishing or enhancing the legal framework; \n                                                \n11  The destinations of the study tours will be to eligible ADB member countries. \n ", "4   \nand strengthening the enforcement of laws through an efficient and consistent \nregulatory framework by market regulators and market participants. \n \n(iv)  Improved  capacity  of  regulatory  authorities  to  develop  high-yield  bond \nmarkets  and  investor  protection  mechanisms.  The  activities  will  include \nproviding training packages to relevant authorities on overall SME debt financing, \nhigh-yield bond markets, and investor protection mechanisms for a high-yield \nbond  market.  International  conferences  will  be  organized  to  bring  together \nexperts  in  the  field  and  to  share  lessons  and  experiences  in  developing \nsuccessful high-yield bond markets. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $440,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of data access, office space, logistics support, and other \nin-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n11.  CSRC\u2019s  Bond  Supervision  Department  will  act  as  the  executing  and  implementing \nagencies. As the executing agency it will administer training, seminar, and conference activities. \nAn advance payment facility procedure will be adopted following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time) to facilitate timely organization \nof training, seminar, and conference activities. \n \n12.  The TA will be implemented from 1 October 2013 to 30 June 2015. Two international \nconsultants and three national consultants will be engaged for a total of 18 person-months. The \ninternational  consultants  will  comprise  an  SME  bond  market  specialist  and  team  leader  \n(5 person-months), and a capital market legal and regulatory specialist (3 person-months). They \nwill be supported by three national consultants: bond market specialist, SME finance specialist, \nand financial data and information analyst (total of 10 person-months). The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. The international and national consultants will be \nselected and engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be \nconducted in line with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.  \n \n13.  Progress of implementation under this TA will be evaluated during review missions \nbased on the performance targets and indicators in the  design and monitoring framework. \nCSRC  will  provide  baseline  data  and  reconfirm  the  interest  of  MIIT  and  other  relevant \ngovernment authorities in sharing the results and outputs produced under the TA. The findings \nand  recommendations  of  the  study  will  be  made  available  to  the  relevant  authorities  and \ngovernment agencies during the final international conference at the TA completion. \n \nIV.
