INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country programming mission in Manila in \nDecember 2010, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) requested ADB to \nprovide policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) to address challenges in the institutional \nframework and administration system on environmental protection and related human resource \ndevelopment. This TA was then included in ADB\u2019s PRC country operations business plan, \n2011\u20132013. 1 In  September  2011,  an  ADB  mission  visited  the  PRC  and  reached  an \nunderstanding  with  the  government  on  the  TA  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  costs  estimates, \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA builds on past and ongoing ADB \nachievements, and draws lessons learned from these interventions to support the efforts of the \nMinistry of Environmental Protection (MEP) in addressing the key issues of ongoing reform of \nthe environmental administration system in the PRC.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The MEP is actively exploring innovative approaches that will transform its institutional \narrangements and administrative system into being cost-effective and supportive of the PRC\u2019s \nemission  reduction  targets  during  the  12th  Five-Year  Plan  (2011\u20132015).  The  government \nenvisages that the institutional reform of the MEP will ultimately contribute to the development \ngoal of livelihood improvement. In March 2008, the National People\u2019s Congress of the PRC \npassed  the  super  ministry  reform  motion  and  elevated  the  State  Environment  Protection \nAdministration (SEPA) to the MEP. The main objective of the reform motion was to reduce the \nproblem  of  overlapping  government  responsibilities  by  combining  departments  with  similar \nlevels of authority and closely related functions. By enlarging the responsibilities and authority \nunder the super ministry reform, it was intended that the previously interdepartmental tasks \nwould  become  intradepartmental  tasks,  allowing  a  single  department  to  deal  with \ncomprehensive  problems  from  multiple  perspectives.  The  reform  further  strengthens  the \nadministrative  stability,  political  will,  decision  making  power,  and  access  to resources  with \nregard  to  environmental  protection.  However,  the  MEP  continues  to  confront  specific \nadministration  and  institutional  challenges  as  part  of this reform  process,  both  horizontally \n(overlap of jurisdiction and responsibility between the MEP and other sector agencies)3 and \nvertically (where responsibility for environmental protection falls under double leadership, i.e., \nthe MEP and local governments). Weak human resource capacity to support implementation of \nthe administration and management system reform process is also a major obstacle.  \n \n3.  To  improve  the  enforcement  capacity  of  national,  regional,  and  local environmental \nagencies,  ADB  provided  the  government  with  TA  (i)  on  transjurisdiction  environmental \nmanagement in 2000,4 (ii) to help develop the regional supervision centers (RSCs) of the MEP \n(then the SEPA) in 2005, and (iii) on Strengthening Enforcement of Environmental Laws and \nRegulations.5  \n \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2011.

The  MEP  and  the  World  Bank  completed  a  preliminary  analysis  of  environmental \nadministration in the PRC in 2009. The key recommendations from the joint analysis were that (i) \nthe  roles  and  responsibilities  of  relevant  government  agencies  should  be  clarified;  (ii) \nenvironmental laws should be reformed and strengthened; (iii) a national environmental policy \noffice should be established; (iv) the MEP\u2019s organizational structure and operational capacity \nshould be strengthened; and (v) the environmental supervision responsibilities and mandate at \nthe regional level (i.e., the regional supervision centers) should be strengthened. The other main \nlesson learned from the previous TA projects (as highlighted in the draft TA completion report) \nwas that timely assistance to the PRC was a critical factor which contributed to the success as \nthe TA progressed concurrently with the government\u2019s institutional development and therefore \nthe two processes mutually benefited. TA workshops and seminars were well utilized to discuss \nthe  mandates,  functionality,  and  staffing  of  the  RSCs  while  these  centers  were  being \nestablished through parallel government efforts.  \n \n5.  ADB has also undertaken a broad assessment of the environment and development \nframework in the PRC, as well as the state of environment, accompanied by an analysis of the \ntechnical,  economic  and  institutional  causes  underlying  the  environmental  problems.6 This \nresulted in a comprehensive series of recommendations on how ADB can most effectively \ncontribute to the government\u2019s broad environmental planning objectives. From the policy and \ninstitutional perspective, the assessment concluded that the PRC\u2019s recent record in terms of \npromoting the policy and institutional framework for environmentally sustainable development \nhas been significant. The assessment further noted that the government has been investing \nsubstantial sums in the environment sector, not only through programs administered by the \nMEP but also through other agencies such as the State Forestry Administration and the Ministry \nof Water Resources. The key recommendations of this assessment include, among other things, \nthat there is a need to (i) provide a better balance between centralized and decentralized \nimplementation, and (ii) resolve disparities between regions, local governments, and sectors. \n \n6.  Building on the key findings and recommendations of the past initiatives, the government \nrequested ADB to provide TA to help the MEP prepare (i) a detailed plan for an improved \nadministration system and institutional framework for environmental protection in the PRC; and \n(ii) recommendations for strengthening the policy framework required to increase environmental \nprotection  skills,  and  human  resources  development  within  the  government  departments \nresponsible for environmental protection. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.   The  TA  will  contribute  to  improved  environmental  management  and  sustainable \ndevelopment  in  the  PRC  by  providing  support  for  addressing  of  the  key  challenges  in \nenvironmental  administration  in  the  PRC. The  impact  of the  proposed  TA  is  an  improved \nenvironmental  administrative  system  with  enhanced  human  resources  capacity  for \nenvironmental protection and management in the PRC. The expected TA outcome is increased \ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  MEP  for  environmental  administration  and  human  resource \ndevelopment. \n \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2011.

Output 1: A detailed plan for an improved administration system and institutional \nframework for environmental protection in the PRC. This output will address the challenges \nin the institutional framework and administration system on environmental protection. A detailed \nplan that addresses both vertical and horizontal challenges in the institutional arrangements and \nadministration  system  on  environmental  protection  will  be  prepared.  From  the  vertical \nperspective, there is ambiguity in responsibilities and/or authorities between the MEP and local \ngovernments. The local environment protection departments do not have any direct reporting \nresponsibilities to the MEP, but report to the local governments which may at times have \nconflicting  priorities  with  the  MEP  on  environmental  protection  issues.  From  the  horizontal \nperspective, the government\u2019s functions  on  environmental  protection have  been  distributed \nbetween various departments such as environmental protection, land, minerals, forests, water, \nand fisheries. The relationship and coordination between these various framework departments \nis unclear. Reform of the environmental protection administrative system in the PRC is therefore \nan  urgent  priority.  From  the  financial  perspective,  the  plan  will  provide  specific \nrecommendations  on  how  the  TA  will  build  on  the  achievements  of  the  ADB-financed \ninstitutional  development  of  the  SEPA\u2019s  regional  environmental  supervision  centers  and \ninvestigation institutes.7 Suboutputs will include the following:  \n(i)  analysis of the current situation and economic development trends in the PRC \nand the subsequent environmental problems, as well as the demand for an \ninnovative environmental administration approach;  \n(ii)  a needs assessment to scope the MEP\u2019s key priorities in relation to its reform \nagenda;  \n(iii)  a report on the PRC\u2019s current institutional setup and administration system on \nenvironmental protection with recommendations for reform of the system; this will \ninclude a comprehensive analysis of the functions and responsibilities of the \nenvironmental  protection  departments  and  other  relevant  ministries  and/or \ndepartments,  including  the  overlapping  functions,  including  financing \nenvironmental  administration;  the  report  will  analyze  and  provide \nrecommendations  on  both  the  vertical  and  horizontal  environmental \nadministration issues faced in the PRC (para. 2); this assessment will include a \ncase  study  on  the  lessons  learned  from  an  integrated  large  department  or \nintersector administration system that has been piloted in some cities;8 it may \nalso include lessons learned from the institutional setup of the various watershed \nmanagement committees in the PRC; \n(iv)  establishment  of  an  indicator  system  for  assessment  of  environmental \nadministration in the PRC; and  \n(v)  a review of international experiences in administration and institutional setup for \nenvironmental protection (including an international study tour).  \n \n9.   Output  2:  Recommendations  for  strengthening  the  policy  framework  on \nenvironmental  protection  skills  and  human  resources  capacity  within  environmental \nprotection departments9. Suboutputs will include the following:  \n(i)  a review of existing policies on human resource development; the review will \nprovide specific recommendations on establishment of a system for managing \nthe human resource development process;  \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2005.

Output 3: A knowledge product (policy brief) summarizing the key findings and \nproviding policy recommendations. The proposed theme for the publication is Environmental \nAdministration and Management in the PRC\u2013an Innovative Way Forward. The key innovations \nare expected to result in recommendations for possible solutions to deal with the vertical and \nhorizontal administration issues described in para. 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.   It is proposed that ADB provide $450,000 equivalent on a grant basis from its Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will provide in-kind counterpart \ncosts and services including the provision of necessary data, office space, local transportation, \nworkshop costs, and other administrative support. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months from 1 December 2011 to 31 May 2013. \nThe MEP will be the executing agency. A high-level consultative committee will be established \nfor consultation on major project issues. The consultative committee will be led by the Human \nResources Department of the MEP, and the Department of Policies, Laws, and Regulations. \nLeaders and/or experts from other agencies, and line ministries will be invited to be members of \nthis committee.11 A senior fellow of the China Engineering Academy will be appointed as the \nhonorary chair of this committee. \n \n13.  A  steering  committee  will  be  established  to  provide  guidance  with  the  project \nimplementation process. The director general of the Human Resources Department of the MEP \nwill be the chair of the steering committee, with the deputy director general of the Human \nResources Department and the leader of the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO) as \nvice-chairs. The steering committee will comprise officers from the relevant divisions and/or \noffices of the Human Resources Department and division I of FECO. A TA management office \nwill  be  established  in  MEP\u2013FECO  to  carry  out  TA  operations.  The  director  of  project \nmanagement division 1 of FECO will serve as the executive director of the TA management \noffice responsible for day-to-day operational matters among ADB, consultants, and related \ngovernment agencies. The TA management office will also ensure active participation and input \nfrom provincial departments. In addition to the specific provincial case studies (footnote 6), \n                                                \n10  This will include assessment of capacity to deal with social safeguard issues in projects and activities. \n11  These agencies and ministries are the Environmental and Natural Resources Protection Committee of the National \nPeople\u2019s Congress, the Environmental Committee of the Human Resources Department of the Chinese People\u2019s \nPolitical Consultative Conference, the State Commission Office for Public Sector Reform, the Ministry of Finance, \nthe Ministry of Land Resources, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Construction, the Ministry of Water \nResources,  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  the  State  Forestry  Administration,  and  the  State  Meteorological \nAdministration. \n ", "  5 \nprovincial officials will be invited for consultation meetings throughout TA implementation. An \nadvance payment facility will be established for TA implementation.  \n \n14.  It  is  estimated  that  the  TA  will  require  3  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices and 32 person-months of national consulting services. Five national consultants (an \nenvironmental policy and institutional specialist, an environmental human resources specialist, a \npublic administration specialist, an environmental legislation specialist, and an environmental \nadministration human resources specialist) and one international consultant (an environmental \npolicy and/or institutional specialist) will be required for TA implementation. The consultants will \nbe engaged by the MEP through a firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time) using the quality- and cost-based selection \nmethod, with a cost\u2013quality ratio of 80:20. The simplified technical proposal approach will be \nused. Equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as \namended from time to time), and will be handed over to the MEP upon completion of the \nproposed  TA.  The  executing  agency  will  be  responsible  for  all  procurement.  Operational \nexpenses for training, workshops, study tours, translation, and printing will be included in the \nconsultant\u2019s contract. The TA proceeds will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The outline terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n15.  The government and ADB have agreed to partially delegate consultant recruitment and \nsupervision  under  the  TA  to  the  MEP,  in  accordance  with  the  terms  stipulated  in  the \nmemorandum of understanding on delegated TA signed between ADB and the PRC.12 \n \n16.  A procurement capacity assessment of the executing agency was conducted in 2008. \nThe key conclusions from that assessment were that the MEP has strong capacity to directly \nmanage the recruitment of consulting services, supervise the consultants, and administer the \nconsulting services contract(s) in accordance with ADB\u2019s policies, guidelines, and procedures. \nThe assessment recommended establishment of a TA management office in FECO with a \ndedicated  team  to  ensure  smooth  processing,  implementation,  and  administration  of  the \nproposed advisory TA. It also emphasized that close interaction with and support from ADB staff \nwas critical to ensure successful delegation and timely execution of the proposed advisory TA. \nThese  recommendations  have  been  adopted  and  the  MEP  has  been  involved  in  the \nimplementation of several delegated TA projects; ADB has provided the necessary capacity \ndevelopment throughout the process (e.g., a senior procurement officer provided support during \nthe contract negotiations). \n \n17.   The  MEP  requested  the  use  of  advance  contracting  for  the  engagement  of  TA \nconsultants. The mission advised the MEP that advance contracting is a normal procedure and \nthat ADB\u2019s approval of advance contracting does not necessarily commit ADB to approve the \nTA or to finance the engagement costs.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  for  the  Innovations  in  Administrative \nFunctions of Environmental Protection and Human Resources Development, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n12  Memorandum of Understanding between the People\u2019s Republic of China and Asian Development Bank on \nEnhanced Partnership on Technical Assistance Delegation to the Executing Agency.
