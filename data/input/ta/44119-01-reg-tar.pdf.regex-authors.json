INTRODUCTION \n1.  Asia\u2019s rise has been the development story of the past 40 years. Japan's remarkable \npost-war revival helped it to reach advanced-economy status with its entry into the Organisation \nfor Economic Co-operation and Development in 1964. Over time, this achievement convinced \nmuch of developing Asia that it should shift away from import substitution toward a more open, \nexport-oriented development model. This approach brought the region sustained growth and \ntransformed developing Asia\u2019s economic landscape\u2014per capita gross domestic product in the \nregion has increased sevenfold since the 1960s (see table). \n \nSuccess Stories of Sustained High-Growth Economies \nPeriod of \nPer Capita Income ($) \nHigh  Number of \nEconomy  Growth  Years  Beginning  2005a \nJapan  1950\u20131983  33  3,500  39,600 \nHong Kong, China  1960\u20131997  37  3,100  29,900 \nSingapore  1967\u20132002  35  2,200  25,400 \nTaipei,China  1965\u20132002  37  1,500  16,400 \nRepublic of Korea   1960\u20132001  41  1,100  13,200 \nMalaysia  1967\u20131997  30  790  4,400 \nThailand  1960\u20131997  37  330  2,400 \nPeople's Republic of China   1961\u20132005  44  105  1,400 \nIndonesia  1966\u20131997  31  200  900 \na In constant 2000 prices.       \nSource: World Bank (as cited in the RHB Research Institute Economic Highlights on 28 January 2010). \n \n2.  Today, Asia\u2019s influence in the global economy is increasing dramatically as the region \nleads the world economy out of recession. Given emerging Asia\u2019s diverse and complex social \nand economic landscape, however, this rapid yet uneven rise offers both significant challenges \nand important opportunities. The proposed research and development technical assistance \n(TA)1 will focus on what Asia must do over the coming 40 years to sustain its growth momentum, \ncontinue to improve livelihoods of the 900 million Asians who exist on less than $1.25 per day, \nwork toward inclusive growth, and prepare for other long-term development challenges. The \nstudy will define several scenarios of what Asia might look like in 2050, depending on the policy \nchoices  made  and  how  they  are  implemented  in  the  pursuit  of  sustainable  growth  and \ndevelopment. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  One major question begs to be asked: Why another study on Asia? While a plethora of \nin-depth studies analyzing specific countries or sectors already exists, there are few region-wide \nstudies that consolidate related themes that impinge upon potential development solutions. This \nstudy  will  not  simply  aggregate  or  summarize  individual  country  analyses;  it  will  instead \nencompass multigenerational issues impacting the region that so far have been largely ignored. \nTo avoid duplication and ensure added value, it will build upon the existing studies done by the \nADB and others.2 \n                                                \n1  The TA concept paper was cleared on 15 February 2010. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities \nsection of ADB's website on 22 March 2010. \n2  Including current studies financed under ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Sustaining Asia's Growth and \nInvestment in a Changing World. Manila (TA 7428-REG, $800,000, approved on 11 December); ADB. 2009. \n ", "2   \n \n4.  The study will focus on what Asia is capable of achieving by 2050, rather than provide a \nset  of  forecasts  of  what  it  will  look  like.  It  will  explore  policies  relating  to  structural  and \ninstitutional reforms that can be implemented to bolster progress. The study will draw upon \nsuccess stories in East Asia and beyond, as well as lessons from Asia\u2019s failures. It will help \nderive  long-term proposals  on  which  development  policies  will  work. A  critical question  is \nwhether a paradigm shift is required for Asia to reach its development potential by 2050 and, if \nso, what that will involve in terms of policies and reforms across the economic and social \nspheres.  \n \n5.  The  region's  strong  production  networks  of  multinational  and  regional  firms  have \ngenerated shared prosperity, mainly in East Asia. This process has been supported by unilateral, \nnondiscriminatory trade liberalization, which, in turn, has ensured that regional integration does \nnot occur at the expense of global interconnectedness. While trade has been the main driver of \ngrowth, the gains have been distributed unevenly\u2014with South Asia, Central Asia, and the \nPacific subregion lagging behind. Similarly, even as the region's high savings rates and levels of \ninvestment  have  supported  its  strong  growth  performance,  the  development  of  domestic \nfinancial systems has not kept pace with the growth of the real sector. The region's vast savings \nare still largely intermediated through international financial centers mostly based outside the \nregion. \n \n6.  As Asia moves from rapid growth to income convergence, the question arises as to \nwhether  integration  will  continue  to  be  largely  market  driven.  As  economies  mature  and \ngraduate beyond production integration, what kind of institutions will be needed to deepen \nintegration while retaining a strong outward-looking thrust intimately connected with the global \neconomy? \n \n7.  The TA will employ a regional focus that cuts across several thematic issues. It will draw \nupon the experience of countries both within and outside the region, especially those that have \navoided the middle-income trap3. The key question the study will answer is: How can Asia \nbecome free of poverty and attain inclusive growth by 2050? To realize this vision, what are the \npolicies and reforms needed in terms of (i) education, technology, and innovation; (ii) population \nand demographic change, (iii) banking and financial markets, (iv) governance and regulatory \nmechanisms, (v) regional cooperation and integration, and (vi) infrastructure? In pursuing this \nvision, what potential negative spillovers and other adverse impacts will have to be mitigated? In \nparticular,  what  is  it  that  will  be  required  to  manage  the  environment  and  tackle  rising \nurbanization, as well as the associated social and health costs, among others? Finally, what are \n                                                                                                                                                       \nTechnical Assistance for Long-Term Projections of Asian GDP and Trade.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA will support Asia\u2019s long-term growth and development, paying particular attention \nto the role that deepening RCI can play by identifying factors to facilitate policy reforms and \nprovide strategic vision for sustaining robust economic growth and promoting wider and deeper \nregionalism  while  retaining global  connectivity. The  TA  will  contribute to  the  adoption and \nimplementation of feasible, long-term regional policies and strategic measures designed to \npromote greater RCI in Asia. \n \n9.  The TA will also provide policy makers across the region with feasible regional policies \nand strategies designed to promote sustainable growth and development. The TA will achieve \nthis by stimulating public debate on policies that can promote long-term sustainable growth and \nincrease regional economic and financial cooperation. This will strengthen Asia's voice in global \nforums. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The primary output of the TA will be the publication of a report that will (i) identify \nregional policies and related strategic measures, focusing on a number of key sectors and areas \nthat are critical to deepening RCI in Asia and the Pacific; and (ii) develop a framework for \nincorporating such reforms and strategic measures into national plans, and coordinate these \nwith the development plans of RCI institutions (knowledge creation). \n \n11.  The TA will start with an issues paper that will comprise a literature review and other \nbackground and preparatory material to ensure that the TA complements, rather than duplicates, \nthe existing knowledge base. Studies on selected sectors and themes will also be produced to \nprovide a solid empirical and analytical foundation for the main report, as follows: \n \n(i)  Education, technology, and innovation. Review the literature and look at the \nexisting policy framework governing education systems in the region, including \nthe adoption of technology to generate skilled workers. Examine how Asia can \ngenerate highly skilled workers in order to build an enabling environment that \nencourages innovation and supports long-term growth. \n \n(ii)  Population and demographic change. Examine the impact of demographic \nchange on Asia, map out policy options for dealing with the problems it is causing, \nand outline how different subregions may require different responses. \n \n(iii)  Banking  and  financial  markets.  Examine  banking  and  finance  sector \ndevelopments, including changes introduced or initiated in light of the recent \nglobal  crisis,  and  the  development  of  financial  norms  and  regulations,  their \nimpact  on  regional  markets,  and  their  role  in  the  evolving  global  financial \narchitecture. Explore how the region can mobilize its vast savings to meet its \ninvestment needs and how to intermediate resources within the region. \n \n \n ", "4   \n(iv)  Governance and regulatory mechanisms. Identify how Asia and the Pacific \ncan  establish  a  durable  governance  structure  for  sustaining  its  economic \nprosperity. Highlight and recommend what policies should be implemented to \nensure that poor governance structures and practices do not emerge as hurdles \nto the region's progress. \n \n(v)  Infrastructure.  Determine  how  countries  can  build,  maintain,  and  connect \ninfrastructure to support sustainable regional economic growth. Explore the role \nof the private sector in generating resources needed to address the region's \nmassive infrastructure deficit. \n \n(vi)  Regional cooperation and integration. Examine how Asia can strengthen its \ninstitutional  architecture  for  regional  cooperation,  and  thus  promote  more \ninclusive economic growth across the region. Can existing institutions, or even \nnew ones, deliver the vision laid out in the Asia 2050 report? What will be the \nmechanisms through which regional institutions deliver agreed-upon objectives? \nWhat kind of governance structures and decision-making principles need to be \nput in place?  \n \n(vii)  Environment and climate change. Identify the adverse consequences of rapid \neconomic growth, urbanization, and industrial expansion; and the deterioration \nand loss of natural resources. Explore the regional dimension of climate change \nand its implications for economic growth. \n \n(viii)  Urbanization. Examine how cities in the region can support growth in the face of \nrapid  urbanization  and  growing  pressure  on  public  services.  Identify  the \nnecessary measures\u2014resources, capacity, and governance structure\u2014to create \nfunctioning cities for sustained growth \n \n12.  Where possible, efforts will be made to integrate private sector participation and gender \nequality issues in the analyses, as they have key implications for envisaging scenarios for Asia's \nfuture inclusive growth. These need to be considered in relation to securing the benefits of \npolicy interventions in identified thematic areas, such as education and human resources, and \npopulation and demographic change. Similarly, there are significant benefits to be gained by \ngiving due consideration to these dimensions within the broader context of governance and \ninfrastructure development.  \n \n13.  More detailed information on the sector and thematic issues are in Appendix 2.   \n \n14.  The secondary output of the TA will involve extensive dissemination of the report's \nfindings and recommendations (knowledge sharing). Workshops in the region\u2019s key cities and \nan  international  conference  will  be organized  to  present and  discuss  these  outputs.  Prior \napproval of relevant DMC governments will be obtained before organizing such workshops and \nconferences.  The  target audience  will  include senior policy  makers and  leading  economic \ndecision  makers  in  the  region,  members  of  the  domestic  and  international  business \ncommunities, and international development partners.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1,300,000, and will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The financing will cover the \n ", "  5 \nremuneration and travel expenses of international and national consultants, travel expenses of \nconference  and  workshop  resource  persons,  equipment  and  database  purchase,  report \nproduction, and other miscellaneous expenses. The TA cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the executing agency. The TA will be implemented by OREI with support \nfrom other ADB departments and offices. OREI will supervise the work of the TA consultants. \nThe TA is expected to be completed over a period of two years from April 2010 to April 2012. \n \n17.  ADB will engage a consulting firm through the quality- and cost-based selection method \naccording to ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime).4 A total of 76 person-months of international consulting services and resource persons \nare required for the TA, and will be recruited through the selected firm: one principal consultant \n(18 person-months),  eight  international  economists  (total  of  32  person-months),  and,  as \nappropriate, five workshop facilitators (total of 4 person-months), two economics editors (total of \n12 person-months), 12 translation services providers (total of 6 person-months), and about 20 \nresource  persons  (total  of  4  person-months).  These  resource  persons  will  be  invited  to \nparticipate in OREI seminars, workshops, and a conference as speakers and discussants.  \n \n18.  The  TA  requires  66  person-months  of  national  consultants  who  will  be  engaged \nindividually according to ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. This includes two project \ncoordinators and two research assistants. National consultants will also form part of the editorial \nteam,  including  two  manuscript  editors,  an  artistic  designer,  two  copy  editors,  and  one \ntypesetter. The scope of work and outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n19.  Purchases  of  equipment  (e.g.,  computer  hardware  and  software)  and  statistical \ndatabases will be undertaken in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time) and in coordination with ADB\u2019s Office of Information Systems and \nTechnology and Office of Administrative Services, where applicable. After the TA, any procured \nequipment  will  be disposed  of  in  compliance with  the project administration  instruction on \nadministering grant-financed technical assistance projects.5  \n \n20.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  the  ADB  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.6 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,300,000 on a grant basis \nfor Asia 2050, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                \n4  Specific quality- and cost-based selection weighting is recommended at 90:10 (90% for the technical proposal and \n10% for the financial proposal). \n5  ADB. 2009.

The technical assistance (TA) will address several thematic issues related to the pursuit \nof sustainable and inclusive growth in Asia and the Pacific, drawing on the experience of \ncountries both within and outside the region, especially those that have dealt with the middle-\nincome trap. The study will identify the policies and reforms needed to help Asia and the Pacific \nbecome free of poverty and attain inclusive growth by 2050. The study will also explore the \npotential adverse  impacts  of economic  growth (e.g., environmental degradation  caused  by \nurbanization) and identify appropriate mitigating measures for policy makers to pursue. Finally, \nthe study will determine how gender equality and women's empowerment can most effectively \ncontribute to Asia's future inclusive growth. \n \n(i)  Education, technology, and innovation. The information technology revolution \nhas  changed  the  way  in  which  knowledge  is  acquired  and  transmitted. \nSuccessful development requires closing the technology and knowledge gap \nbetween  the  developed  and  developing  world.1 For  Asia  and  the  Pacific, \nincreased productivity and improved competitiveness may be achieved through \nvarious measures, including developing human capital through education and \ntraining, and encouraging innovation by adopting new technologies.2  \n \nProgress in education in Asia has not kept pace with the demands of a rapidly \ndeveloping  world.  Demographic  shifts  can  work  to  Asia's  advantage  only  if \nworkers  are  able  to  acquire  the  necessary  skills.  Though  experiences  vary \namong Asia\u2019s subregions, common issues include renewing the emphasis on \nquality,  upgrading  teacher  skills,  streamlining  education  bureaucracies  for \neffectiveness and efficiency at the national and subnational levels, and ensuring \nbroader and more equitable access to schools. Dropout and incompletion rates \nare  alarmingly  high  in  some  countries.  In  more  than  half  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB's) developing member economies, only seven out of \nten  children  entering  first  grade  complete  the  primary  cycle,  and  only  four \ncomplete  the  secondary  cycle.3 Furthermore,  as  economies  become  more \nknowledge-based, it becomes increasingly important to invest in tertiary and \nhigher education. As the region and its needs continue to change in the years \nahead, investment in education will become increasingly important. \n \n(ii)  Population and demographic change. By the middle of this century, Asia's \nelderly population4 is projected to reach 922.7 million, and their share of the total \npopulation is expected to rise to 17.5%. Asia accounted for only 44% of the \nglobal elderly population in 1950, but by 2050, this is projected to increase to \n62%.5 Within the next few decades, Asia will be home to the largest population of \nelderly people in the world. A rapidly aging population can have adverse effects \non domestic economic performance and prospects through a decrease in the \nlabor force, lower savings and investment rates, and spiraling pension and health \ncare costs. However, countries in Asia are not aging at an even pace. This \n                                                \n1  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  2008.

World Population Prospects: The 2008 Revision. New York. \n \n \n(iii)  Banking and financial markets. Asia's banking sector was relatively shielded \nfrom  the  recent  global  crisis  because  of  the  significant  restructuring  in  the \naftermath of the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis that focused on instituting stronger \nrisk management systems and regulations, and adopting prudential lending. In \nthe same period, domestic capital market infrastructure was boosted to support \nthe real sector. \n \n                                                \n6  The ASEAN+3 refer to the 10 ASEAN member states plus the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic \nof Korea.  \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nHowever,  the  development  of banking  and  capital  markets  remains uneven. \nWhile intraregional capital flows have improved, the region still has a long way to \ngo before it is able to efficiently tap into its own resources rather than rely on \nintermediation through markets outside the region. Stronger banking systems \nand capital markets will allow the region to efficiently allocate capital into sectors \nand subregions within Asia that are either paying a premium for financing or are \nsimply unable to access it.   \n \n(iv)  Governance and regulatory mechanisms. Governance and regulatory reform \nhave been an essential part of the region\u2019s rapid economic expansion in recent \ndecades. They were the foundation of the region\u2019s long stretch of economic \ngrowth prior to the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis, and played a critical role in the \neconomic resurgence after the crisis. The region has had remarkable success in \npursuing  governance  and  regulatory  reform,  whether  in  bank  consolidation, \ndeveloping local currency and regional bond markets, liberalizing capital flows, or \nallowing more flexible exchange rate mechanisms. But this reform process is far \nfrom over. Several indicators\u2014including the World Bank\u2019s ranking of business-\nfriendly countries\u2014show that regulatory quality in a number of developing Asian \ncountries has barely improved since the early 2000s, and that in a few countries \nregulatory quality has actually declined. Continuing the regulatory reform process \nmust remain a high priority in the years ahead. \n \nTraditionally, governance and regulatory reform initiatives have focused on what \ncan and should be done nationally, but growing integration necessitates a closer \nlook at what can and should be done regionally. In many ways, the process of \nreform is best viewed as an iterative one: regulatory reforms are essential to \nremoving  domestic  or  \u201cbehind  the  border\u201d  barriers  to  regional  economic \nintegration. However, the impetus to remove these domestic barriers will often \nhave to come from outside the country. ADB's experience with implementing \nregional projects has shown that, in some instances, the best entry points for \nregulatory reform can be found beyond national borders. There is a key role for \nregional cooperation and capacity building to strengthen domestic policy-making \ninstitutions and encourage a common purpose in the pursuit of governance and \nregulatory reform. \n \n(v)  Infrastructure. Infrastructure plays a key role in promoting and sustaining rapid \neconomic growth. Differences in infrastructure help explain East Asia\u2019s superior \ngrowth in relation to other emerging subregions. Improving connectivity in Asia \nand the Pacific would bring the region large welfare gains through increased \nmarket access, reduced trade costs, and more efficient energy production and \nuse. If the required investment toward pan-Asian connectivity is made in the \nregion\u2019s transport, communications, and energy infrastructure during 2010\u20132020, \nthen developing Asia\u2019s real income during that period could reach $13 trillion.7 \n \nAs barriers to trade in Asia and the Pacific have fallen, infrastructure deficiencies \nhave grown significantly. There has been progress in developing subregional \ninfrastructure  programs  since  the  early  1990s,  with  overlapping  subregional \ngroups cooperating to varying degrees. These connections are most advanced in \n                                                \n7  ADB and Asian Development Bank Institute (ADBI). 2009.

Manila: ADB and Tokyo: ADBI.  \n ", "Appendix 2  11 \nthe  Greater  Mekong  Subregion,  while  less  developed  in  other  subregions. \nConnections between subregions\u2014notably between South Asia and East Asia\u2014\nare  particularly  weak.  Further  progress  requires  creating  an  effective  new \nframework for regional cooperation, as well as strengthening coordination among \nand capacity within existing frameworks. \n \n(vi)  Regional  cooperation  and  integration.  Asia\u2019s  progress  in  expanding  its \nnational economies is one of the great success stories of the last few decades. \nThis spectacular performance has been facilitated by greater integration with \nregional and international markets. The integration of regional markets has been \nachieved  through  a  combination  of  market  forces  and  regional  cooperation \ninitiatives. Asia's integration has been supported by a dense web of regional and \nsubregional institutions designed to foster cooperation on specific issues and \naddress common concerns. \n \nThis institutional structure has served the region well thus far. However, it cannot \nbe assumed this will continue to be the case in the future. Key questions that \narise with respect to regional cooperation and integration (RCI) include: Can \nexisting institutions, or even new ones, deliver the vision laid out in the Asia 2050 \nreport? What will be the mechanisms through which regional institutions deliver \nagreed-upon  objectives?  What  kind  of  governance  structures  and  decision-\nmaking  principles  need  to  be  put  in  place?  The  challenge  for  Asia  is  to \nstrengthen its institutional architecture for regional cooperation to enable it to \nentrench achievements and deepen integration, thus promoting more inclusive \neconomic growth across the region. \n \n(vii)  Environment and climate change. Rapid economic growth in Asia has depleted \nthe region's natural resources and contributed to environmental degradation. The \nurgency  in  addressing  these  concerns  and  constructing  environmentally \nsustainable  approaches  to  economic  growth  has  increased.  The  continued \ndepletion of natural resources, combined with the direct and indirect impacts of \nclimate change, could easily reverse the region's economic and social gains, and \nincrease health risks for the poorest and most vulnerable. \n \n(viii)  Urbanization. The region's phenomenal economic growth has also led to a rapid \nrise in its urban population. The result has been increased air and water pollution, \nproblems  with  waste  management, and  unsustainable demands on  soil  and \nwater  supplies  for  food  production,  among  others.  Energy  consumption  for \ntransport and industry has also contributed significantly to a rise in the production \nof greenhouse gases.8 These conditions are likely to worsen as urbanization \ncontinues at its current pace, or even accelerates, and urban infrastructure is \nstretched beyond capacity. For example, it is estimated that the number of urban \ndwellers in Asia will increase by 1.5 billion between 2000 and 2050.9 \n \n2.  The TA will seek to integrate private sector participation and gender equality in the study, \nas these factors are critical to securing sustained, inclusive growth in the region. For example, \nthe role of the private sector and promotion of gender equality should be considered in terms of \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2009.

International Consultants \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will prepare a study that focuses on what Asia is capable of \nachieving  by  2050,  and  the  related  policies  and  reforms  that  may  be  required  to  reach  its \ndevelopment potential. To assist in the implementation of the TA, a firm will be engaged to recruit \nthe international consultants listed. \n \n1.  Principal Consultant (18 person-months) \n \n2.  The principal consultant will be a well-known international economist with (i) a master's \ndegree in economics, or related field, (ii) proven knowledge and extensive work experience in \npolicy making and economic research in Asia and the Pacific, and (iii) solid experience in similar \nassignments involving the preparation and coordination of research products on regional economic \ndevelopment and thematic issues. The consultant will be engaged to  \n \n(i)  prepare the literature review and draft the issues paper relating to the thematic \nareas as well the overall framework; \n(ii)  assist in preparing the specific terms of reference for the various parts and chapters \nof the thematic studies; \n(iii)  prepare the draft thematic studies and guide, coordinate, and review the work of the \nvarious international economists; \n(iv)  oversee the quality and content of the final report; \n(v)  coordinate with the economics editors to ensure that the resulting reports, papers, \nand studies are of high quality; and \n(vi)  participate in the international conference and workshops, as necessary. \n \n2.  Economists (8 persons, 4 person-months each) \n \n3.  The economists will be engaged to assist and support the preparation of the various \nthematic studies. The scope of engagement for each economist will be determined separately, \naccording to the requirements of each study and in coordination with the principal consultant. The \neconomists will have (i) an advanced degree in economics (with strong econometric and statistical \nskills), international relations, political science, or in other areas relating to thematic issues to be \nexamined  in  the  report;  (ii) proven  knowledge  and  extensive  work  experience  on  regional \ncooperation and integration issues in Asia and the Pacific; and (iii) extensive experience working \nwith international financial institutions. The economists will generate a report on thematic areas \nthat will be reviewed by the principal consultant and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The \nreport will be subject to revision based on peer reviews and feedback from the principal consultant \nand ADB. The project will hire the economists with expertise in different sectors and thematic areas, \nbut not necessarily limited to the following areas:  \n \n(i)  Education, technology, and innovation. The economist will review the literature \nand look at the existing policy framework governing education systems in the region, \nincluding the adoption of technology to generate skilled workers. The economist will \nexamine how Asia can generate skilled knowledgeable workers in order to build an \nenabling environment that encourages innovation and supports long-term growth. \n(ii)  Population and demographic change. The economist will examine the impact of \ndemographic change on Asia, map out policy options for dealing with the problems it \n ", "Appendix 4  15 \nis causing, and outline how different subregions may require different responses. \n(iii)  Banking and financial markets. The economist will look at (i) banking and finance \nsector developments, including changes introduced or initiated in light of the recent \nglobal  crisis;  and  (ii)  the  development of financial  norms  and  regulations, their \nimpact  on  regional  markets,  and  their  role  in  the  evolving  global  financial \narchitecture. The report prepared by the economist should closely examine how the \nregion can mobilize its vast savings to meet its investment needs, and how to \nintermediate the resources within the region. \n(iv)  Governance and regulatory mechanisms. The economist will produce a report \nthat identifies how Asia and the Pacific can establish a durable governance structure \nfor sustaining its economic prosperity. The report should highlight and recommend \nwhat policies should be implemented to ensure that poor governance structures and \npractices do not emerge as hurdles to the region's progress. \n(v)  Infrastructure. The economist will look at how countries can build, maintain, and \nconnect infrastructure to support sustainable regional economic growth. The report \nshould focus on how inadequate coverage and quality of infrastructure services \ncreate bottlenecks that constrain growth in many parts of the region. The report will \nalso  explore  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  generating  resources  needed  to \naddress the region's massive infrastructure deficit. \n(vi)  Regional cooperation and integration. The economist will examine how Asia can \nstrengthen its institutional architecture for regional cooperation, and thus promote \nmore inclusive economic growth across the region. Can existing institutions, or even \nnew ones, deliver the vision laid out in the Asia 2050 report? What will be the \nmechanisms through which regional institutions deliver agreed-upon objectives? \nWhat kind of governance structures and decision-making principles need to be put \nin place?  \n(vii)  Environment  and  climate  change.  The  economist  will  produce  a  paper  that \nexamines the adverse consequences of rapid economic growth, urbanization, and \nindustrial expansion; and the deterioration and loss of natural resources. The paper \nwill also look at the regional dimension of climate change and its implications for \neconomic growth. \n(viii)  Urbanization. The economist will produce a paper that examines how cities in the \nregion can support growth in the face of rapid urbanization and growing pressure on \npublic  services.  The  paper  will  identify  the  necessary  measures\u2014resources, \ncapacity,  and  governance  structure\u2014to  create  functioning  cities  for  sustained \ngrowth. \n \n4.  Where possible, efforts will be made to integrate private sector participation and gender \nequality in the study, as they have implications for envisaging scenarios for Asia's future inclusive \ngrowth. These need to be considered in relation to maximizing the benefits of policy interventions \nin  identified  thematic  areas  such  as  education  and  human  resources,  and  population  and \ndemographic  change.  Similarly,  there  are  significant  benefits  to  be  gained  by  giving  due \nconsideration to these dimensions within the broader context of governance and infrastructure \ndevelopment.  \n \n3.  Workshop Facilitators (5 persons, 4 person-months total) \n \n5.  Academic institutions, research centers, firms, or individual consultants will be hired to \nassist ADB staff organize an international conference and several workshops.

They will facilitate the smooth, \neffective, and efficient organization of these events, including logistics, communication, printing of \nmaterials,  and the  various  aspects  of  telecommunications  equipment  (e.g.,  videoconferencing \nfacilities) that may be required. \n \n4.  Economics Editors (2 persons, 6 person-months each) \n \n6.  The editors will review and edit drafts and manuscripts to ensure coherence and readability, \nsound economic arguments, and the highest publication standards. Specifically, the editors will \n \n(i)  examine economic arguments to assess if they are logical and based on accepted \neconomic theory and principles; \n(ii)  rewrite,  add,  or  delete  information;  help  revise  various  pages  or  sections,  if \nnecessary,  to  tighten economic  arguments; fill  in  gaps  in  the  discussions; and \nensure the smooth flow of ideas; and \n(iii)  examine tables, figures, and charts to ensure data consistency within pages and \ndocuments; and suggest deletions and additions to ensure that they are useful. \n \n5.
