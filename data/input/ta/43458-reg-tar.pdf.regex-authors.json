INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) renewed its Energy Policy in 2009,1 emphasizing \nthree  priorities  for  achieving  inclusive  and  sustainable  growth  in  its  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs): (i) promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy; (ii) maximizing access \nto energy for all; and (iii) promoting energy sector reform, capacity building, and governance. \nADB  has  also  committed  to  reinforcing  its  efforts  to  facilitate  the  transfer  of  low-carbon \ntechnologies to DMCs and to double financial support for clean energy projects to $2 billion per \nyear by 2013 to enhance regional energy diversity and security. The proposed research and \ndevelopment  technical assistance (TA)  on  Effective  Deployment  of  Distributed  Small  Wind \nPower Systems in Asian Rural Areas will help implement ADB's Energy Policy and assist DMCs \nin scaling up viable renewable energy development with private sector involvement to improve \nthe quality of life of the poor. It will create opportunities for ADB's sovereign and nonsovereign \nlending operations, build local capacities, and strengthen regional cooperation on clean energy \ntechnology development and deployment. The vice-president (Operations 1) approved concept \nclearance of the TA on 2 October 2009.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The  TA  builds  on  ADB\u2019s  Energy  for  All  Initiative3 and  aims  to  supply  reliable  and \naffordable emission-free electricity to poor communities in remote windy areas at no fuel cost. It \nwill explore innovative and practical approaches to (i) reduce costs of wind power equipment by \ntransferring  appropriate  technologies  and  optimizing  manufacturing  processes;  (ii)  reshape \nfinancing modalities and instruments, and mobilize carbon credits in a pragmatic way; (iii) \nencourage public\u2013private partnerships to stimulate investment and research and development \nactivities for clean and renewable energy; (iv) displace combustion of biomass and fossil fuels to \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions; and (v) improve national and village-level capacities for \nplanning,  implementing,  and  maintaining  decentralized  systems  for  power  generation  and \ndistribution.  The  TA  is  aligned  with  ADB's  Medium-Term  Corporate  Strategic  Priorities  for \nResearch, especially (i) promoting inclusive growth, (ii) addressing climate change, and (iii) \ncoping with rising commodity prices. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Nearly 1 billion poor people in Asia and the Pacific are still trapped in poverty, without \naccess to electricity that is crucial for job and income opportunities, as well as the delivery of \nbasic education, health, and communication services. Many of these poor people are living in \nremote mountainous areas (e.g., in Afghanistan, India, and Nepal); deserts and grasslands (e.g., \nin Kazakhstan, Mongolia, and the northwestern part of the People's Republic of China [PRC]); \nand ocean islands (e.g., in Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Pacific Islands such as the \nCook Islands, the Marshall Islands, and Samoa). In many cases, it is technically difficult or too \ncostly  to  extend  power  grids  to  these  remote  underdeveloped  areas  with  low  volumes  of \nelectricity consumption. Local schools, hospitals, processing plants, shops, and other public, \ncommercial, and residential facilities have to rely on diesel power generation. Diesel must be \nimported from abroad, hauled over long distances, and stockpiled at high inventory costs. Fuel \nshortages,  vulnerability  to  rising  and  volatile  oil  prices,  lack  of  essential  spare  parts,  and \ninadequate maintenance can frequently interrupt the diesel power supply, resulting in inferior \nservice quality, high operational costs, and excessive environmental pollution. The number of \nfamilies in villages lacking electricity could increase if the population growth rate outpaces the \nrural electrification rate. Even a small amount of electricity, provided by tapping into local wind, \nsolar, and biogas resources would lighten up the lives of many poor people in remote areas, \nespecially women and children. Most Millennium Development Goals will not be achieved if the \nhardships caused by energy poverty are allowed to persist.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2009. Energy Policy. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 October 2009.  \n3  ADB. 2008. Energy for All Initiative. Manila. \n ", "2   \n \n4.  Nevertheless, many of these remote areas are endowed with abundant, inexhaustible, \nand free wind resources. Distributed small wind power systems, normally with a rated capacity \nof less than 100 kilowatts, have been successfully used for decades in developed countries4 \nand have contributed significantly to the reduction of rural poverty in the PRC.5 They can be \nsupplied by more than 200 manufacturers in the world. Accumulated technical expertise and \nmanufacturing capacities can be readily mobilized, and some of the existing small wind turbine \nmodels can be quickly adapted and renovated, to improve access to electricity in Asia's windy \npoor rural communities. \n \n5.  Deployment of distributed small wind power systems does not depend on current and \nfuture capacities of power grids for off-loading, does not need to go through cumbersome \nprocesses  for  tariff  determination  and  adjustments,  does  not  require  strong  infrastructure \nsupport and special equipment (e.g., large trucks and heavy cranes) to transport and install big \ncomponents (e.g., towers, turbine nacelles, and long blades), and does not require building \naccess roads. Small wind power systems need only small foundation plots. Land acquisition and \nresettlements are rare. It is less knowledge-intensive and skill-demanding to install, operate, \nmaintain, and repair these small systems. They can be implemented in a modular way within a \nfew months and do not involve high speeds, temperature, pressure, voltage or loads. \n \n6.  Deployment  of  distributed  small  wind  power  systems  will  avoid  the  substantial \ninvestment  needed  for  generating,  transmitting,  and  distributing  electricity  produced  from \ncentralized combustion of fossil fuels. Financial costs and environmental damage embedded in \nline losses (normally more than 10% for rural consuming end points) in voltage conversion and \nlong distance transmission are eliminated, when electricity is produced and consumed in the \nsame neighborhood. In places where rich wind resources cannot be harnessed by constructing \nlarge-scale wind farms\u2014because of infrastructure bottlenecks, impossible grid integration, or \nlack of capacity to handle large power projects\u2014these small systems can provide a practical \nsolution in helping utilize indigenous renewable resources more quickly and effectively to supply \nclean, reliable, and affordable electricity to reduce poverty in poor rural communities. \n \n7.  Three fundamental challenges must be addressed to facilitate effective deployment of \ndistributed small wind power systems in remote windy poor areas. First, the current costs are \ntoo high, in either power terms (about $4,000 per kilowatt) or energy terms (about $0.20 per \nkilowatt-hour).  Leading  manufacturers  of  small  wind  power  systems  are  often  located  in \ndeveloped countries where labor and material costs are high, zoning and permitting constraints \nare stringent, and tax burdens are heavy. Hence, the market size remains small. Shipping the \nsystems and spare parts across oceans to Asia will impose additional handling costs, export \nand import duties, and time delays. It is possible and desirable, with concerted efforts, to cut the \noverall energy costs by about 50% through design improvement, optimization in manufacturing \nand installation, and enhancement of operation and maintenance.  \n \n8.  Second, poor rural communities cannot afford the heavy up-front investment and do not \nhave adequate access to financing. It is not easy for the poor to meet the requirements of \ncommercial banks on creditworthiness or asset securitization. Carbon credits are difficult to \nobtain for sparse singular installations because of the high transaction costs and procedural \nuncertainties. Existing financial instruments, from formal or informal channels, including banks, \nmicrocredit institutions, and other cooperative arrangements, shall be assessed and modified \nwhen they are used to finance energy access projects in rural communities. Innovative financing \nmodalities  need  to  be  designed  and  carbon  credits  mobilized  to  make  small  wind  power \n                                                 \n4  For example, in the early part of the 20th century, the United States had about 3 million windmills in operation, \nsupplying water for homes, farms, and livestock. \n5  According to the World Wind Energy Association, the PRC has manufactured and operated more than 300,000 \nsmall wind turbines, accounting for about 80% of the world\u2019s total installation.  \n ", "  3\nsystems  more  implementable  and  affordable.  Grants  from  international  development \norganizations and governments that are generally being extended for low-carbon development \nand poverty reduction programs can also be used to reduce the up-front costs.  \n \n9.  Third, as demonstrated by the past experiences, small wind power systems are usually \nnot sustainable without private sector participation. Public\u2013private partnerships are essential for \naccelerating engineering innovation, cost reduction, resource mobilization, project construction, \nand capacity development. Modified implementation mechanisms, such as aggregated planning, \nfinancing,  installation,  and  maintenance  through  a  build-own-operate-transfer  modality,  or \nimplementation by experienced renewable energy service companies, can be viable ways to \nhelp  poor  communities  harness  indigenous  renewable  energy  resources  and  empower \nthemselves.  Ensuring  local  project  participation  and  ownership,  while  exploring  additional \nincome-generating opportunities through the new access to electricity, will further enhance the \ncost-effectiveness and sustainability of small wind power systems. National and village-level \ninstitutional  capacities  will  need  to  be  strengthened  to  enable  replication  of  the  pilot \ndemonstration projects in other areas with similar conditions.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be the improvement of economic, environmental, and health \nconditions of poor rural communities in remote windy areas. The TA outcome will be enhanced \naccess to clean, reliable, and affordable electricity in windy poor villages currently without \nelectricity  by  effectively  deploying  small  wind  power  systems.  By  2020,  small  wind  power \nsystems will serve at least 2.5 million poor people and avoid about 1.25 million tons of carbon \ndioxide emissions per year.  \n  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  four  DMCs  to  be  determined  during  the  TA \nimplementation. The participating DMCs shall have (i) demonstrated strong commitment to \ndeveloping renewable energy and increasing access of the poor to modern energy services; (ii) \nclearly identified poor communities with abundant wind resources; 6 and (iii) established stable \nmacroeconomic  and  conducive  business  environments  for  developing,  manufacturing,  or \ndeploying  small  wind  power  technologies  and  systems.  The  key  TA  activities  include  the \nfollowing: \n(i)  Needs and resource assessment: \n(a)  assessing socioeconomic conditions and infrastructure bases in typical \nwindy poor rural communities currently lacking access to electricity; \n(b)  identifying and selecting priority locations for effectively deploying small \nwind power systems; \n(c)  analyzing  demand  patterns  and  load  management  requirements  to \nimprove the efficiency of future electricity uses, such as utilization of the \nmost efficient lighting, pumping, and refrigeration facilities; and \n(d)  mapping  wind,  solar,  and  biogas  resources  and  load  distribution  in \nselected  poor  communities  for  adequacy  verification,  system \nconfiguration, mini-grid planning, and optimal micro-siting of small wind \npower systems. \n(ii)  Integration and optimization of the system supply chain: \n                                                 \n6  The initial assessment of wind resources in many Asian countries (e.g., Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic \nRepublic, Maldives, Mongolia, Nepal, Philippines, the PRC, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Viet Nam) have been \nconducted,  indicating  that  wind  resources  are  commercially  exploitable  in  many  poor  communities  not  yet \nconnected to the power grid.  \n ", "4   \n(a)   evaluating technical designs, installation requirements, and operational \nprocesses of small wind power systems, and exploring possibilities to \nincrease  electricity  output,  simplify  maintenance,  minimize  capital  and \noperational expenses, and improve system reliability and durability;7 \n(b)   comparing different approaches to energy storage and balancing to cope \nwith intermittency difficulties of stochastic wind power;8  \n(c)   examining suitable ways to integrate the complementary benefits of wind, \nsolar, and biogas resources to optimize cost-effective energy systems, \nand improve predictability and reliability of electricity supply; \n(d)   addressing negative environmental impact of conventional batteries that \nhave  been  used  in  many  off-grid  renewable  energy  projects;  and \nscrutinizing  possibilities  to  improve  their  efficiency,  safety,  and \nenvironmental friendliness; and \n(e)   reviewing  manufacturing,  delivery,  and  servicing  procedures  to  seek \nopportunities to cut energy costs, through, for instance, modularized and \nstandardized  design,  manufacturing  localization,  and  achievement  of \neconomies of scale in mass production.   \n(iii)  Improvement in financing instruments and delivery mechanisms: \n(a)   designing  innovative  financing  mechanisms  to  reduce  capital  costs, \nmitigate risks, and enhance financial viability;  \n(b)   exploring ways to mobilize grant assistance, activate carbon credits in a \nprogrammatic way, and secure regulatory incentives;  \n(c)   experimenting  with  a  financial  leasing  modality  to  minimize  collateral \nrequirements and enable periodic debt amortization through the collection \nof service charges; and \n(d)   assisting  in  building  public\u2013private  partnerships  and  the  build-own-\noperate-transfer  modality  for  smooth  implementation  and  sustainable \noperation. \n(iv)  Construction of six pilot projects in the following areas to generate demonstration \neffects for rapid replication in other suitable locations: \n  (a)   remote mountainous areas,  \n  (b)   deserts and grasslands, and  \n(c)   ocean islands. \n(v)  Policy recommendations and capacity building activities: \n(a)   recommending policies to DMCs and the international community on how \nto facilitate transfers of low-carbon technologies and strengthen regional \ncooperation  to  create  a  favorable  regulatory  framework  and  business \nenvironment for maximizing the use of indigenous renewable resources, \nand to produce global public goods in clean energy to mitigate global \nwarming and climate change; and \n(b)   conducting dissemination and capacity building activities to engage more \npoor  communities,  financial  institutions,  private  sector  partners,  and \nnongovernment organizations; and to expedite deployment of distributed \npower  generation  systems  exploiting  wind  and  other  indigenous \nrenewable energy resources. \n \n                                                 \n7  Including examining engineering and financial gains by incorporating most recent developments in rotor and blade \naerodynamics,  airfoils,  direct-drive  permanent  magnet  generators,  intelligent  power  electronics  and  control \nsubsystems, compact materials, extended support towers, and noise-reduction techniques. \n8  Including  evaluating  the  suitability  of  air  compression,  flywheels,  and  hydrogen  conversion  energy  storage \ntechnologies, and exploring direct uses for pumping and purifying water, desalinating seawater, heating houses \nduring harsh winters, and producing ice and salt for coastal fishing families. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $3.87 million, including $1.10 million \nbudgeted for establishing six pilot projects.9 The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($2.62 million from TASF\u2013IV and $1.25 million from TASF\u2013\nother sources). The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.10    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 2.5 years, between January 2010 and June 2012. ADB \nwill be the executing agency for the TA. The Private Sector Operations Department, East Asia \nDepartment, and Regional and Sustainable Development Department will work together to carry \nout all TA activities, in close collaboration with other operations departments and resident \nmissions, and in full compliance with ADB safeguard policies. Each participating DMC may \ndesignate  an  existing  agency  responsible  for  providing  energy  to  the  rural  people  as  the \nimplementing  agency  for  the  TA  project.  ADB  will  start  TA  activities  in  a  DMC  only  after \nreceiving a TA support letter from its government. \n \n14.  The  TA  requires  150  person-months  of  consultant  inputs  (30 international  and  120 \nnational). The international consultants are expected to transfer knowledge and experience to \nthe  national  consultants,  who  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the  pilot  demonstration \nprojects. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Any equipment and materials to be financed \nby  the  TA  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). On completion of the TA project, the equipment will become the \nproperty  of  the  government  and  participating  local  institutions  and/or  communities. \nDisbursements  under  the  TA  project  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook.11 Appendix 3 gives the outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants. \n \n15.  Semiannual TA progress reports will be provided for timely monitoring and evaluation. \nGood  practices  and  lessons  learned  through  the  TA  project  will  be  disseminated  by \ndemonstration of pilot projects, capacity building activities, workshops, international conferences, \nand wide distribution on the internet and through multimedia tools. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n16.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $3,870,000  on  a  grant  basis  for  Effective  Deployment  of \nDistributed Small Wind Power Systems in Asian Rural Areas.  \n \n                                                 \n9  Comprising the costs of feasibility studies; design; statutory approvals; equipment for power generation, storage, \nand distribution; installation; and arrangement for operations and maintenance. \n10 The governments of DMCs and project beneficiaries in the host countries that participate in the TA project are \nexpected to provide in-kind and/or cash contributions to facilitate implementation of TA activities. However, such \ncontemplated in-kind government counterpart contributions have not been included in the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan in Appendix 2. \n11 ADB. 2008.
