The  Accelerating Infrastructure  Investment  Facility  in  India  (AIIFI)  is  a  $700  million \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  that  was  approved  in  October  2013  with  the  India \nInfrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) as both the executing and implementing agency. \nThe MFF supports the Government of India in promoting infrastructure growth through increased \nprivate sector investment in public-private partnerships (PPPs). The facility\u2019s impact is facilitated \nprivate sector investment in infrastructure PPPs and its outputs include enhanced availability of \nlong-term finance for PPP subprojects and improved operational capacity of IIFCL. \n \n2.  Tranche 3 is the final of two tranches.1 It is estimated to fund $300 million in subprojects \nthat IIFCL has sanctioned in its indicative pipeline and is expected to help catalyze the financial \nclosing of $2.4 billion of investment. At IIFCL\u2019s option, the tranche will be disbursed in Indian \nrupees or United States dollars on such terms and conditions as set forth in the loan agreement. \nTranche 3\u2018s implementation is expected over 4 years. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TRTA) is being processed not only to \nsupport IIFCL\u2019s implementation of tranche 3 but to help its overall operational capacity. Earlier \ntechnical assistance provided to IIFCL focused on safeguards support, such as establishing its \nown safeguard team and developing a safeguards framework consistent with national standards.  \nThis TRTA not only aims to further strengthen IIFCL\u2019s safeguards management but will also \nsupport improvements in its overall financial management. \n \n4.  This TRTA will help address some of the weaknesses noted in the financial management \nassessment for IIFCL namely: (i) proper management of project-specific risks, (ii) evolving \ngovernance and risk management systems in terms of checks on originations and staffing, (iii) \ndeveloping management information systems, and (iv) underdeveloped financial forecasting \ncapacity. The TRTA will help IIFCL strengthen its operations in: (i) financial management by \nevaluating and improving IIFCL\u2019s risk management framework, strengthening its management \ninformation systems,  developing multiyear financial projections and updating its credit risk models; \nand  (ii)  social  and  environmental  safeguards  by  training  IIFCL  staff  on  best  practices  in \nimplementing  projects  with  significant  safeguard  risks  (category  A)  and  funding  safeguard \nmonitoring reviews of ADB-funded projects. With the increasingly important role of IIFCL in the \ngovernment\u2019s drive for long-term infrastructure financing, not only as a participant but as a lead \nin lending consortiums, IIFCL will need to substantially ramp up its technical capacity to meet the \nchallenges ahead.  \n \n5.  The MFF did not originally include an attached technical assistance, so this TRTA is being \nprocessed on a standalone basis and is included in the 2018 country operations business plan.2  \n \n \n                                                \n1  Tranche 2 was approved in 2015. However, the government thereafter increased the guarantee fee. With this higher \nguarantee fee, tranche 2 was uneconomical for IIFCL and ADB cancelled tranche 2 in 2016. Because tranche 2 has \nexpired, this tranche is designated as number 3. \n2  ADB. 2018. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2019\u20132021. Manila.\u2028 \n ", "2 \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n6.  Output 1: Financial management. The TRTA will (i) evaluate IIFCL\u2019s risk management \nframework  and  help  implement  recommendations  to  strengthen  it,  (ii)  certify  the  material \nintegration of IIFCL\u2019s management information systems, (iii) assist IIFCL in the development of \nmultiyear financial projections, and (iv) update its credit risk models.  \n \n7.  Output 2: Social and environmental safeguards. The TRTA will (i) expose IIFCL to best \npractices in implementing projects with significant safeguard risks (category A) to enable it to play \nthe role of lead lender and (ii) fund independent semiannual safeguard monitoring reviews of \nADB-funded subprojects. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $500,000 which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-Others).  IIFCL  will  provide  (i)  counterpart  staff \nremuneration, (ii) office accommodation and supplies, (iii) local transport, (iv) logistical support, \nand (v) other in-kind contributions. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. IIFCL was \ninformed that approval of the TRTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n9.  ADB will delegate administration of the technical assistance to IIFCL which will be the \nexecuting  agency.  A  total  of  36.7  person-months  of  consultancy  services  will  be  required \nintermittently. The TRTA is estimated to begin in April 2019 and will be implemented intermittently \nthrough December 2022. The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  April 2019\u2013December 2022 \nExecuting agency  India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB  \nFirm: QCBS   One international  $108,000 \n(financial institution  and three national \ncapacity development)  experts (6.2  \nperson-months) \nFirm: QCBS  Two national  $260,000 \n(credit risk  experts (16.9 \nmanagement)  person-months) \nIndividual: individual  One international  $132,000 \nselection  expert and one \nnational expert \n(13.7 person-\nmonths) \nDisbursements  The TRTA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time) \nADB= Asian Development Bank, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, TRTA = transaction technical assistance.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n10.
