During  the  process,  the  Project  will  set  up  and \nstrengthen,  up-front  at  the  preconstruction  stage,  viable  water \nmanagement associations (WMAs), which will take on key roles in \nall  program  delivery  decisions  and  sustainable  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of local water infrastructure, while installing \ninstitutional capacities within the supporting agencies to manage \nthe overall process, including O&M of main water infrastructure. \nThe Project will cover 100,000 hectares (ha) of FCD/I schemes in \nthe southwest areas and benefit about 0.8 million rural population, \nthe  majority  of  whom  are  poor.  The  project  process  and \nmanagement will demonstrate the way to substantially enhance \nand  sustain  the  performance  of  existing  FCD/I  schemes  by \ndeveloping WMAs with representation from diverse stakeholders, \nparticularly  the  poor,  and  providing  them  with  agriculture  and \nfishery support services. The Project will also support ongoing \nsector-wide  institutional  reforms  toward  good  governance,  in \nharmony  with  other  sector  interventions  assisted  by  external \nfunding agencies.  \n   \nRationale  Water  fundamentally  affects  rural  livelihood  activities  in \nBangladesh,  with  the  country\u2019s  major  regional  river  systems \nbringing about massive annual floods, severe dry-season water \nscarcity, and periodic natural disasters. Effective management of \nwater is critical to address pervasive rural poverty problems. The \ntask is complicated due to fairly diverse and complex stakeholder \ninterests and vulnerable natural ecosystems. It is thus paramount \nto plan, develop, and manage water resources in a strategic and \nintegrated  manner  while  mobilizing  and  empowering  diverse \nstakeholders. While the country has established a large number of ", "iv   \nFCD/I infrastructures, their performance remains suboptimal due \nto lack of effective management systems that can meet the needs \nof diverse stakeholders particularly the vulnerable poor, and most \ncritically,  provide  sufficient  O&M.  Within  the  country,  the \nsouthwest areas face the most acute problems due to reduced \ndry-season  inflow  and  associated  social  and  environmental \nhardships, e.g., salinity intrusion and annual monsoon flooding.   \nIn recent years, the Government has progressively improved the \npolicy, institutional, and planning framework for the water sector \nwith the coordinated support of external financiers including the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB).  The  National  Water  Policy \n(NWP) of 1999 adopted key principles including integrated water \nresource management (IWRM), and sustainable service delivery \nand  O&M  with  progressive  transfer  of  facility  management  to \nWMAs.  Improvement  of  the  framework  is  followed  by  ongoing \ninstitutional reforms of sector agencies for better governance, and \nthe adoption of the National Water Management Plan (NWMP) in \n2004 that provides a sector strategy and priority programs with a \nlong-term  perspective.  The  key  challenge  now  is  to  transform \nthese initiatives into genuine sector operations.  \nWithin this framework, enhancing and sustaining the performance \nof existing FCD/I systems has been accorded high priority, given \nthe  need  to  strengthen  flood  resistance  and  the  scope  for \ngenerating  high  impacts  with  short  lead  time  at  relatively  low \ncosts. On this account, ADB has played a lead role in supporting \nthe initiative for small-scale schemes that are being implemented \nwith increasingly better performance. The Project is needed to \ndevelop and institutionalize effective mechanisms to be applied to \nlarger FCD/I schemes, building on the good practice and lessons \nlearned,  to  support  the  process  of  participatory  and  holistic \nplanning, inclusive WMA development, infrastructure and support \nservices to meet critical local development needs, and sustainable \nO&M. Successful implementation of the Project will demonstrate \nthe way to fully operating key NWP principles in FCD/I systems, \nwith further improved governance of the sector institutions.   \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The Project\u2019s overall impact will be enhanced economic growth \nand  reduced  poverty  in  the  concerned  FCD/I  areas,  while \nproviding  a  model  for  rejuvenating  poorly  performing  FCD/I \nsystems  that  can  be  replicated  throughout  the  country.  The \nProject outcome will be enhanced and sustained productivity of \nthe  selected  existing  FCD/I  systems  suffering  from  low \nperformance and high incidence of poverty.  The outcome will be \nachieved by (i) providing effective program delivery mechanisms \nfor integrated planning, WMA formation and strengthening, water \nmanagement  infrastructure,  support  services  for  developing \nagriculture and fishery and livelihood enhancement of the poor, \nand  sustainable  O&M;  and  (ii)  strengthening  institutions  for \neffective provision of services to achieve this end.  \n   ", "  v\nCost Estimates  The estimated project cost is $43.4 million equivalent, comprising \nforeign exchange of $9.7 million and local currency equivalent of \n$33.7 million, including taxes and duties of $3.0 million equivalent. \n   \nFinancing Plan          ($ million)\nForeign  Local  Total \nSource  Percent \nExchange Currency  Cost \nADB    6.2    13.8    20.0    46 \nGovernment of    3.5    9.0    12.5    29 \nthe Netherlands \nGovernment    0.0    10.9    10.9    25 \nof Bangladesh \n   Total    9.7    33.7    43.4    100 \n  Source: ADB estimates.  \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  The equivalent in various currencies of SDR 13,863,000 from the \nSpecial  Funds  resources  of  ADB.  The  terms  are  32  years \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of \n1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until December 2013 \n   \nEstimated Project  June 2013 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Bangladesh  Water  Development  Board  (BWDB)  under  the \nMinistry of Water Resources (MOWR) \n   \nImplementation  Project implementation institutionalizes effective mechanisms to \nArrangements  plan, develop, and manage water resources and deliver support \nservices with the regular setup of BWDB and line departments, \nwith outsourcing to the private sector including nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs). A project management office is established \nin the Faridpur zonal office of BWDB to manage overall project \nimplementation,  while  day-to-day  implementation  is  done  in \nsubproject management offices. A joint management committee \n(JMC) will be established in each subproject with representation \nfrom WMAs, local government institutions, and line departments \nto  decide  on  subproject  implementation  matters.  A  steering \ncommittee  will  be  established  for  central-level  coordination  of \nconcerned ministries and departments.  \n \nProject  O&M  will  essentially  operationalize  the  NWP  by \ntransferring  the  management  of  subordinate  infrastructures \n(having  a  command  area  of  2,500  ha)  to  WMAs  and  jointly \nmanaging  other  main  facilities  under  the  JMC.  To  support \nsustainable O&M, the Project will (i) adopt the procedure that has \nproved  effective  in  small-scale  FCD/I  schemes  with  ADB \nassistance,  as  regards  the  transferred  facilities  managed  by \nWMAs; and (ii) as to the remaining facilities, strengthen central \n ", "vi   \nfunding  and  its  management  systems  including  expenditure \nrationalization,  improved  management  information  systems  for \nscheme  performance  monitoring  and  O&M  planning,  and \nperformance-based  priority  allocation  of  O&M  budgets  for \nschemes where NWP arrangements are operating satisfactorily.  \n   \nProcurement  All procurement will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \nfor  Procurement.  Major  contracts  for  vehicles,  equipment,  and \nmaterials  exceeding  $1.0  million  will  be  procured  through \ninternational  competitive  bidding,  whereas  packages  valued  at \n$1.0  million  equivalent  or  less  will  be  procured  following \ninternational shopping procedures. Civil works under the Project \nwill be up to $2.0 million, and will be contracted through local \ncompetitive bidding (LCB).  \n   \nConsulting Services  For  institutional  strengthening  and  project  management,  the \nProject will provide consulting services of 604 person-months: 72 \ninternational and 532 domestic. The consultants will be selected \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants  to  assist BWDB  and  other  agencies  in  identifying, \nplanning, developing, and managing water from integrated and \ncross-sectoral perspectives while establishing viable WMAs and \nJMCs. In consideration of the nonengineering complexity and the \nneed for timely fielding, the Government has requested ADB to \nselect the consultants on its behalf. In addition, the Government \nwill engage technically qualified private providers including NGOs \nto  support  planning,  beneficiary  mobilization,  implementation, \nresettlement,  support  service  delivery,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  \n \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will improve the livelihood of about 0.8 million people \nBeneficiaries  by rehabilitating and improving 100,000 ha of underperforming \nFCD/I  schemes.  The  main  benefits  are  increased  agriculture \nproduction\u2013brought  about  by  improved  flood  protection,  local \nretention  and  storage  of  water  for  irrigation,  and  improved \ndrainage to enable expansion of diversified crop cultivation\u2013along \nwith  increased  fishery  production,  improved  flood  security  of \nsettlements,  increased  labor  opportunities,  better  nutrition,  and \nincreased incomes and reduced poverty. The economic internal \nrates of return of two sample subprojects are 16.5% and 21.2%. \nAt  the  regional  level,  the  Project  will  improve  service  delivery \nmechanisms  to  attain  maximum  benefits  and  sustainability \nthrough FCD/I renovation with sound quality control, along with \nimproved sector governance with policy and institutional actions. \n \nSome 55% of the population in the two subproject areas fall below \nthe  poverty  line,  higher  than  the  national  average.  Its  social \ndevelopment strategy will focus on enhancing the participation of \nthe  poor  in  water  management  activities,  delivery  of  targeted ", "  vii\nsupport to the most vulnerable poor, enhancing the role of women \nin  project  institutions  and  WMAs,  and  institutional  reforms  for \nmore effective operation of gender development within BWDB.   \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  Project  has  certain  risks  that  could  adversely  affect  its \neffective  implementation  and  sustainability:  (i)  stakeholder \nparticipation, (ii) sustainability including delivery of quality outputs \nand sustainable O&M, and (iii) BWDB management capacity. The \nProject has incorporated mitigating measures to address these \nrisks.  Beneficiary  participation  is  pursued  by  ensuring  up-front \nWMA strengthening to achieve measurable targets at the pre-\nconstruction  stage.  Governance-related  sustainability  risks  are \nmitigated by strengthening management, monitoring, and quality \ncontrol systems of the concerned institutions. The O&M risk is \nmitigated through comprehensive agreed-on measures including \nmanagement  transfer  of  local  facilities  to  WMAs,  expenditure \nrationalization, local resource mobilization, and improved budget \nallocation  and  management.  BWDB  managerial  capacity  is \nstrengthened through implementation of comprehensive agreed-\non  institutional  reform  actions.  All  project-related  institutional \nreforms will be pursued in harmony with other externally funded \nprograms, with the support of the consultants.  \n   \n   \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Map 1\n89 o 10\u2019E 89 o 00'E 92 o 00'E\n25 o 00'N 25 o 00'N\nBANGLADESH\nSOUTHWEST AREA INTEGRATED WATER\nRAJSHAHI SYLHET\nRESOURCES PLANNING AND B A N G L A D E S H\nDHAKA\nMANAGEMENT PROJECT DHAKA INDIA\nINDIA\nKHULNA CHITTAGONG\n22 o 00'N 22 o 00'N\nBay of Bengal\nMYANMAR\nMathabhanga R KUSHTIA Ganges   River PABNA 89 o 00'E 89o  55\u2019E 92 o 00'E\n.\nBhairab RM.EHERPUR Kumar R.

I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan  to  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Southwest  Area  Integrated  Water \nResources Planning and Management Project, and (ii) proposed administration by the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  of  a  grant  for  the  Project,  provided  by  the  Government  of  the \nNetherlands.1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n2.  Agriculture and Rural Sectors. Despite good progress in recent years, Bangladesh \nremains one of the poorest countries in the world with an annual per capita gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) of $389 (in 2003) and poverty incidence of 50% (in 2000). Over 85% of the poor \nlive  in  rural  areas  and  most  are  engaged  in  agriculture  and  related  nonfarm  activities. \nAccordingly, accelerating agricultural and rural growth is key to reducing poverty in the country.  \n3.  While the share of agriculture in the country\u2019s GDP has declined to 23%, the rural \nincluding  the  nonfarm  sector  accounts  for  over  60%  of  GDP  and  76%  of  employment. \nAgriculture showed a relatively strong growth with an average growth of 2.9% per annum with \nstructural  changes  since  1990.  The  rural  nonfarm  subsector  (such  as  input  marketing, \nmechanical services, agroprocessing, and trading) grew more rapidly. Agriculture growth was \nmainly due to the increased production of food crops led by paddy and potato (for which per \ncapita production increased by 10 kilograms [kg] since 1990), culture fishery (4% increase per \ncapita per annum since 1990), and to a lesser extent livestock and vegetables.2 As a result, the \ncountry has achieved near self-sufficiency in paddy. However, the growth rate slowed down \nrecently, averaging 2% during 2000-04. Most crops suffer from substantial gaps between farm \nyields and demonstration plot yields. The present farm yields for paddy stand at 3.4 tons per \nhectare (t/ha), marginally above subsistence levels. The country also remains a net importer of \ncereals and most other crops. The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) has \naccorded high priority to rural development, with strategic emphasis on (i) intensifying cereal \ncrops and diversifying to high-value crops while promoting fisheries and livestock, (ii) providing \nrural infrastructure to reduce natural and other shocks, and (iii) promoting nonfarm activities.  \n \n4.  Water Resources. The country is located at the confluence of three major regional river \nsystems  that  pose  significant  physical  challenges  including  massive  monsoon  floods  and \ndrainage congestion (inundating 30% of the country\u2019s land area on average), riverbank erosion, \nserious  dry-season  water  scarcity,  natural  disasters  such  as  cyclones,  and  widespread \ngroundwater arsenic (affecting 30\u201350% of the population). Access to and effective management \nof water are critical for the rural poor, as water fundamentally affects their productive and \nlivelihood  activities.  Water  management  is  further  complicated  by  diverse  and  complex \nstakeholder  interests,  widely  varying  in  different  topographic  locations  among  agriculture, \ncapture and culture fisheries, boat transport, rural industries, drinking water, and associated \nnonfarm activities. Water is also vital for the country\u2019s rich natural ecosystems. Thus, it is \nparamount  to  manage  this  critical  resource  through  an  integrated,  participatory,  and \ndecentralized approach with due attention to the interests of the vulnerable poor.  \n                                                 \n1  Project preparatory technical assistance was provided under ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s \nRepublic of Bangladesh for the Southwest Area Integrated Water Resources Management Project. Manila.  \n2  Sector composition for crops (including horticulture), fisheries, livestock, and forestry changed from 65%, 15%, \n13%, and 7%, respectively, in 1990 to 58%, 22%, 12%, and 8%, respectively, in 2003. ", "2 \n5.  Substantial efforts have been made since the 1950s to manage water resources with \nlarge public investments, culminating in 9,500-kilometer (km) embankments, 11,500 km canals, \n60  km  revetments,  and  over  13,300  hydraulic  structures.  While  these  structures  provide \nessential flood protection and drainage functions for 5.4 million ha (covering 30% of the net \ncultivated  area),  their  performance  remains  suboptimal,  with  chronic  facility  deterioration \nproblems and underachieved potentials. On the other hand, the irrigated area expanded rapidly \nfrom 1.6 million ha in 1980 to 4.4 million ha in 2001, thanks to expansion of private groundwater \nirrigation, the main driving force for paddy production growth.3 Yet the cost of groundwater \nirrigation is rising as more water is extracted, posing a constraint on further expansion.  \n \n6.  Southwest Area. The southwest area of 4 million ha (27% of the country\u2019s total) covers \nthe south bank of the Ganges and the Lower Meghna rivers, with a population of 28.6 million \n(23% of the total). The region produces 21% of the national GDP. With its sectoral share of 36%, \nagriculture plays a dominant role, yet its productivity is lagging behind the national average. \nPaddy yields remain at 3.1 t/ha due mainly to the dominance of traditional varieties associated \nwith the area\u2019s susceptibility to flooding, and slower expansion of irrigation (38% as opposed to \nthe national average of 55% of net cultivated area). About 51% of the area\u2019s population is poor, \nsecond  to  the  highest\u2013the  northwest\u2013among  the  country\u2019s  four  main  regions.  As  to  water \nresources, the southwest has 78 flood control, drainage/irrigation (FCD/I) systems4 covering 1.1 \nmillion ha. It has the most acute water management problems in Bangladesh. Of particular \nconcern is water shortage due to reduced inflow into the Ganges tributaries and associated \nsocial  and  environmental  hardships,  including  salinity  intrusion,  livelihood  loss,  and \nenvironmental degradation. Other challenges include (i) the flood inflow from the Ganges in the \nmonsoon  and  deterioration  of  existing  FCD/I  systems,  (ii)  drainage  congestion  and \nsedimentation of tidal channels caused by coastal polder construction and reduced tidal swept \nvolume, (iii) arsenic contamination (highest in the country), and (iv) vulnerability to cyclones and \ntidal surges. Improving water management is critically needed in this region of the country.   \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  Agriculture and Fishery. The Government initiated market-oriented sector reforms in \nthe early 1980s, deregulating input and output marketing and improving the delivery of support \nservices. While the reforms led to dynamic response in some areas such as groundwater \nirrigation  and  fertilizer  use,  performance  results  in  other  areas  are  mixed.  The  supply  of \nimproved seeds remains a major constraint, with meager private sector participation, particularly \nfor food grains that meet only 25% of the annual replacement needs. Fertilizer use increased by \n35% from 1993 to 2003, but is poorly balanced and falls significantly below the recommended \ndosage. As a result, 60% of net cultivated areas now suffer from low soil fertility with depletion \nof soil organic matter and micronutrients. For culture fisheries, the supply of fingerlings remains \na constraint, along with the restricted access of the poor to water bodies. In output marketing, \nprivate agribusiness such as contract farming of cereals and cash crops is emerging. Yet the \nmarketing chain is fragmented with information dissymmetry and lack of infrastructure. As to \nextension, while public agency staffs have technical know-how, field extension is constrained by \nlack of resources and weak farmer participation, calling for collaboration with private providers. \nThese conditions call for careful planning and strategic provision of critical support services, and \nconcerted efforts to facilitate the delivery of key inputs, considering marketing opportunities.  \n                                                 \n3  Paddy production in spring (aus), monsoon (aman), and winter (boro) changed from 2.7, 7.8, and 2.4 million tons, \nrespectively, in 1980, to 1.8, 10.7, and 11.8 million tons, respectively, in 2002.  \n4  An FCD/I scheme is a system of water management infrastructure generally comprising flood embankments and \nnetworks of internal drainage/irrigation canals that serve mostly for drainage purposes but also can be used for \nirrigation, in particular in the tidal impact areas in the southwest and southeast regions.  \n ", "3 \n8.  Water Resources \u2013 Past Efforts. Following the devastating floods in 1987 and 1988, \nmajor international coordinated efforts were provided in the 1990s under the Flood Action Plan \n(FAP) to systematically address the water management problems. A total of 26 regional and \nthematic studies were assisted by 16 external funding agencies including ADB, which supported \nregional  studies  for  the  southwest  and  for  flood  protection  in  Dhaka.  While  the  studies \nestablished  a  substantial  knowledge  base,  they  also  revealed  deficiencies  of  the  past \ninterventions\u2013which  had  generally  mixed  performance\u2013including  those  assisted  by  ADB. \nSpecifically, previous planning efforts tended to focus on constructing major single-purpose \nflood protection structures, and overlooked diverse stakeholder needs and multidimensional \nimplications of water management. Top-down implementation led to negative environmental and \nsocial impacts (such as reduced capture fishery causing hardship to the poorest), and left many \nlocal  water  management  problems  unaddressed  or  opportunities  unutilized.  Most  critically, \noperations and maintenance (O&M) was inadequate and underresourced, with little beneficiary \nparticipation  and  support,  leading  to  facility  deterioration,  frequent  flood  damage,  and \nsubsequent rehabilitation needs. Major reforms in the policy and institutional framework and \ncapacities of sector agencies became necessary to effectively meet the sector challenges.  \n9.  Recent Sector Reforms and Challenges. Following the FAP findings, the Government \ninitiated comprehensive policy and institutional reforms for the sector. The National Water Policy \n(NWP), adopted in 1999, set out due policy goals and principles for participatory and integrated \nwater resources management (IWRM), strategic planning, sustainable O&M with progressive \nmanagement transfer to water management associations (WMAs), and improved governance of \nsector organizations. Along this line, institutional reforms of a key sector agency, Bangladesh \nWater Development Board (BWDB), were initiated, including (i) reformulation of its Board to \ninclude stakeholder representatives and sector experts, (ii) long-term assignment of leadership, \nand (iii) significant staff rationalization (by over 50%) with skills mix diversification and a self-\ndeveloped  draft  vision  now  envisaging  transformation  from  a  top-down  implementer  to  a \nservice-oriented agency. Guidelines for participatory water management (GPWM) were also \nfinalized by stipulating procedures and arrangements to implement sector interventions with \nWMA empowerment. The National Water Management Plan (NWMP) was also finalized in 2004, \nwith its short-term programs emphasizing an enabling environment and institutional capacities.  \n10.  However, the reforms are still at the early stage of consolidation, calling for careful \nsupport to transform the initiatives into sound sector operations. In this context, a large number \nof existing FCD/I schemes are yet to be placed under the new and improved management \narrangements. In the meantime, the country also experienced huge damage from floods in \n1998, 2000, and 2004,5 all of which led to large-scale external emergency assistance including \nloans from ADB. While these recurrent losses demonstrated the need for establishing more \nflood-resistant infrastructure with better hazard risk management, equally critical are institutions \nfor sound regular maintenance, since poorly maintained facilities are more vulnerable to floods \nand cause larger damage once they fail. Moreover, many FCD/I systems have large unachieved \nbenefits, and their improvement would provide larger returns with a short lead time and less \nsignificant negative environmental and social impacts. Thus, enhancing and sustaining the \nperformance of existing FCD/I infrastructure with improved O&M remains a critical and urgent \nneed, and is accorded high priority in the NWMP. The sector analysis is in Appendix 2.  \n11.  External  Assistance and  Coordination. In response to the NWP and the NWMP, \nexternal funding agencies are renewing support to the sector with a harmonized approach. Key \npartners  include  the  World  Bank,  Government  of  the  Netherlands,  Canadian  International \nDevelopment Agency (CIDA), and ADB. For rural areas, the World Bank is appraising the Water \n                                                 \n5  The most recent 2004 floods have caused a total damages estimated at $2.2 billion nationwide. \n ", "4 \nManagement  Improvement  Project  (WMIP)  with  the  Netherlands  cofinancing  to  assist  in \nrehabilitating 380,000 ha of medium-sized and large FCD/I schemes with a sector project \nmodality.6 The Netherlands Government is providing twinning missions (TMs) to support BWDB \nto  prepare  and  implement  comprehensive  action  plans  to  embed  reforms  into  day-to-day \noperations, while  supporting  investments  including  integrated  planning  and  rehabilitation  of \nmedium-scale  FCD/I  schemes  and  estuary  development.  CIDA  is  assisting  in  improving \nBWDB\u2019s financial management systems. ADB is supporting improvement of small-scale FCD/I \nsystems through the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) with the Netherlands \ncofinancing,7 and riverbank protection along two large FCD/I systems,8 where developing the \nirrigation command area was also assisted through a separate project (Appendix 3).   \n12.  ADB  Contributions,  Lessons,  and  Strategy.  ADB  played  an  important  role  in \npromoting the aforementioned reforms. Its assistance to small FCD/I set up a framework for \ntransfer of management to WMAs that was embodied in NWP, while establishing a WMA legal \nframework  with  the  amended  Cooperatives  Act.  Its  implementation  procedures  and \narrangements, improved over time with an increasing number of well-performing WMAs, were \nadopted as the Government\u2019s GPWM, now to be applied in all sector interventions. Other loans \nalso contributed to the progress of institutional reforms.9 Although operationalizing NWP with \nsound O&M still remains a future goal, useful lessons were learned. First is the need for \nintegrated planning, development, and management of water to address diverse needs and \nconcerns; and for providing sufficient services to address other local production constraints. \nSecond, sufficient time, resources, and management are critical for WMA formation, with clear \nmeasurable targets that should be achieved prior to physical works. O&M requirements should \nbe agreed upon at this stage, with up-front cash contribution and field training. Third, quality \ncontrol in infrastructure and other program delivery and system operation requires rigorous \nattention, with particular care to protecting poor people\u2019s interests. Fourth, well-managed local \ninfrastructure provides a basis for WMAs to start addressing social agendas for the poor, and \ntaking on lead roles for a local development process as a collective enterprise (Appendix 4). \n13.  ADB\u2019s new country strategy and program (CSP) for Bangladesh was prepared in 2005 \nfollowing the Government\u2019s PRSP. Given the high incidence of rural poverty, the CSP prioritizes \ninvestments in agriculture commercialization, rural infrastructure, and rural water management. \nThe strategy for the water sector is to institutionalize integrated planning, development, and \nmanagement with sustained O&M, while providing support for critical infrastructure where high \ngrowth and poverty impacts are expected. The programs build on good practices and lessons, \nand promote further improved institutional framework in harmony with development partners. All \nare consistent with ADB\u2019s water policy.  \n14.  Sector  Opportunities  and  Policy  Dialogues.  The proposed Project was prepared \nthrough a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA, footnote 1) to institutionalize the said \nmanagement process for medium-sized and large FCD/I schemes in the selected hydrological \nsub-regions in the southwest. The Project will operationalize the GPWM. The PPTA prepared \nparticipatory integrated water management plans (IWMPs) for two large FCD/I schemes, which \nidentified diverse water-related interests and cross-sectoral development constraints, and laid \n                                                 \n6  Small, medium-sized, and large schemes are defined as those having command area of up to 1,000 ha, between \n1,000 and 5,000 ha, and over 5,000 ha, respectively.  \n7  ADB. 2001.

Manila (approved in November 2003). \n9  For example, an irrigation service fee was introduced following BWDB Act 2000 allowing project offices to collect, \nretain, and use irrigation fees, compared with the earlier system of collecting water tax as government revenue.  \n ", "5 \nout holistic measures to enhance and sustain their performance.10 The feasibility project design \nincorporated the aforementioned lessons, with provisions for setting out clear development \ntargets; sufficient up-front WMA strengthening; WMA-driven program delivery with due support \nfor agriculture, fishery, and livelihood activities; mechanisms to protect and address the interests \nof  the  poor;  intensive  strengthening  of  WMAs\u2019  O&M  capacity;  and  improved  internal  and \nexternal quality control, with use of outsourcing to private providers including nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs).  \n \n15.  In addition, policy dialogues were undertaken to enhance the effectiveness of sector \noperations in support of the Project, in harmony with other externally funded programs. First, the \nGovernment  developed  comprehensive  action  plans  to  operationalize  NWP  for  improved \nperformance  of  the  sector  agencies,  including  BWDB  and  Water  Resources  Planning \nOrganization (WARPO), through better governance, in particular with TM support.11 Second, \ngeneric  measures  to  enhance  O&M  were  agreed  upon  and  substantially  advanced:  (i) \nrationalizing recurrent expenditure, (ii) introducing sound O&M performance monitoring and \nplanning at the scheme level, (iii) improving management with performance-based scheme-wise \nbudget allocation, and (iv) progressively enhancing the O&M budget allocated for BWDB. In \naddition,  O&M  responsibilities  of  medium-sized  and  large  FCD/I  systems  were  clarified, \nincluding  joint  management  of  main  facilities  and  management  transfer  to  WMAs  for \nsubordinate facilities. Third, the Government agreed to lease public water bodies in the project \ncommand  areas  directly  to  the  concerned  WMAs  to  enable  WMAs  to  provide  fish  culture \nopportunities  to  their  poorest  members  while  generating  WMA  incomes. 12  Fourth,  the \nGovernment  agreed  to  initiate  steps  to  introduce  external  technical  auditing  for  water \nmanagement infrastructure works, by piloting it under the Project through the office of the \nComptroller and Auditor General (CAG) and holding further dialogues toward their introduction. \nThe policy and institutional actions matrix is in Appendix 5.  \n  \n16.  Against this backdrop, the Project is needed to demonstrate and institutionalize the way \nto enhance and sustain the performance of medium-sized and large FCD/I schemes, a critical \nand prioritized NWMP agenda, building on the agreed-upon policy dialogue actions and lessons \nto be applied. These provide a sound basis for achieving substantially enhanced productivity \nand sustainability in comparison with prereform interventions. The Project envisages covering \n100,000 ha of FCD/I areas, including 57,000 ha where IWMPs were prepared under the PPTA. \nA process-type approach to the rest of the area is justified on the basis of the improved policy \nand planning framework as reflected in the NWP and NWMP, and development of sector \nagency capacities that is ongoing through the progressive reforms being put into operation with \nthe harmonized support of  externally assisted programs, including the Project.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The impact of the Project will be reduced poverty incidence measured in incomes of the \npopulation and food availability, and institutionalization of effective mechanisms for enhancing \nand sustaining the performance of FCD/I systems, applicable and replicated in other areas. Its \n                                                 \n10  Chenchuri Beel and Narail schemes. They were identified and assessed during the ADB-assisted FAP regional \nstudy and follow-on TA loan (Appendix 3) along with a number of other schemes, and upgraded under the PPTA \nwith IWMPs and renewed institutional designs. A synthesis of IWMPs is included in Appendix 8.  \n11  The action plans are set up as a common set of actions pursued in externally funded programs to operationalize \nNWP. For BWDB, they cover institutional development strategy, improving personnel and financial management, \ndecentralizing functions, and improving internal work procedures including monitoring and quality control.   \n12 The Government policy is to lease out public water bodies for exploitation through a bidding process.   \n ", "6 \noutcome will be enhanced productivity and sustainability of the selected existing FCD/I systems \nsuffering from low performance and high incidence of poverty in the selected subregion of the \nsouthwest.13 This will be measured from (i) economic indicators e.g., increased production, \nincomes, and employment in the subproject areas; and (ii) institutional indicators associated \nwith sustainable O&M (e.g., sound WMA and joint management institution establishment, and \nadequate  O&M  programming  and  implementation),  and  improved  agency  performance  in \nservice delivery (Appendix 1). The Project will cover a geographic area of about 100,000 ha \nhaving some 0.8 million population.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n18.  The Project outputs are (i) participatory IWMPs for the selected FCD/I schemes, (ii) \nproductive and sustainable water management systems set up through IWMP implementation in \nthe project area,  and (iii) strengthened capacities of institutions delivering programs.  \n \n1.  Part A: Participatory IWMPs \n19.  Following the sample IWMPs prepared under the PPTA, the Project will prepare IWMPs \nfor  additional  FCD/I  schemes  covering  about  43,000  ha,  to  be  selected  following  the  set \nselection criteria. The IWMPs will lay out holistic programs for enhancing and sustaining the \nperformance of the FCD/I schemes, following intensive participatory analyses of diverse local \nwater management problems and development constraints, and assessments of feasibility and \nsafeguards. The process is managed by BWDB and WARPO (for technical backstopping) in \ncollaboration with LGED and other line departments, under the guidance of the council of the \nconcerned  village  union  chairpersons  and  the  support  of  the  consultants  for  institutional \nstrengthening and project management support (ISPMS). The IWMPs will be endorsed by the \nsaid council before they are finalized, and will be regularly reviewed and updated.  \n \n2.  Part B: Productive and Sustainable Water Management Systems  \n20.  This component will establish improved water management systems for each FCD/I \nscheme through IWMP implementation. For effective implementation and management, the \nscheme area is divided into hydrologic subunits (command areas) controlled by individual local \nstructures.14 They  will  be  implemented  individually  through  process-based  subcomponents \ncomprising (i) preparation of a subunit implementation plan (SIP) and mobilization of WMA \nbeneficiaries; (ii) water management and associated infrastructure; (iii) support services for \nagriculture, fishery and livelihood enhancement; and (iv) monitoring and support for sustainable \nO&M. In implementing individual subunits, each subcomponent will have distinct output targets, \nwhich  are set  as  benchmarks  for  starting  the  activities for  the  succeeding subcomponent. \nSubunits with better performance in initial processes will be implemented on a priority basis, \nalong with those that need urgent implementation such as embankments in critical sections.  \n \na.  SIP Prepared and WMA Formed with Beneficiary Mobilization \n21.  SIP Preparation. A WMA for each subunit and subordinate water management groups \n(WMGs) corresponding to individual facilities within the subunit will be formed following the \ncooperatives legal framework. At the outset, the Project will support the formation of ad hoc \nWMA and WMGs within the subunit, and prepare an SIP through private firms by setting out \n                                                 \n13  Located in six districts: Faridpur, Gopalganj, Jessore, Magura, Narail, and Rajbari.  \n14  The two sample schemes comprise five independent subschemes covering 5,000\u201313,000 ha benefit areas, within \nwhich are 14 semi-independent compartments and about 50 subunits.  \n ", "7 \nspecific impact targets and associated programs including inputs and delivery schedules. The \nSIP will also reconfirm subunit economic feasibility, include resettlement and environmental \nmanagement plans following the IWMP safeguards outputs, and be endorsed by the WMA.  \n \n22.  WMA Formation and Strengthening. The Project will establish empowered WMAs to \nmanage activities at preconstruction, construction, and postconstruction stages. The goal is to \nhave WMAs play effective organizational, operational, resource mobilization, and networking \nfunctions for productive water management with sustainable O&M. After the SIP is finalized, the \nProject will support the WMA to implement the institutional development plan specified in the \nSIP, including (i) enrolling members and mobilizing functional subgroups; (ii) registering, with \nthe  formation  of  executive  committees  and  operational  rules;  and  (iii)  collecting  cash \ncontribution equivalent to annual O&M requirement for the concerned facilities transferred to \nWMAs, and establishing that contribution as an O&M reserve fund. The Project will facilitate the \nprocess  by  recruiting  and  fielding  community-based  organizers  (CBOs)  locally  that  will  be \ntrained by private providers including NGOs with the support of the ISPMS consultants.  \n \n23.  Implementation Agreement. During the above process, participatory detailed design of \nwater management structures will be undertaken, along with the refinement and implementation \nof the resettlement plans (RPs) included in the SIP. After the WMA achieves its institutional \ndevelopment  targets  and  endorses  the  detailed  design  with  RP  implementation,  an \nimplementation agreement will be signed by representatives of the Government, WMA, and \nlocal government institutions (LGIs), as a benchmark to start civil works procurement.  \nb.  Water Management and Associated Infrastructure \n24.  This subcomponent will deliver water management infrastructure specified in the SIP, \nincluding flood embankments (resectioning, improvement, and retirement), regulators, sluice \ngates and pipes, water retention structures, reexcavated drainage/irrigation canals, and local \nriverbank protection (using lower cost sand-filled geotextile bags). The WMA will be trained to \nmonitor civil works. Internal technical audit will be strengthened, with a pilot introduction of \nexternal technical audit to support construction quality control.      \nc.  Enhanced Production and Livelihood through Support Services  \n25.  Upon completion of infrastructure works, this subcomponent will develop beneficiary \nskills for enhanced productivity and incomes, and WMA capacities to support this end. Its \nprogram inputs are specified in the SIP and monitored by WMA. Outputs are also monitored \nagainst the SIP targets for land use, production, and incomes at each subunit level.  \n \n26.  Agriculture and Fishery Development. The Project will provide extension services \nthrough local offices of the Department of Agriculture Extension (DAE), Department of Fisheries \n(DOF),  and  private  service  providers  including  NGOs,  to  promote  adoption  of  improved \npractices made possible by the water infrastructure. Services for agriculture will include (i) a \ncampaign for improved soil nutrient management, (ii) field demonstration and training through a \nfarmer field school approach for crop intensification and diversification, and (iii) workshops and \nfarmer tours. As part of the field demonstration, the Project will also support  seed multiplication \nby delivering foundation seeds and technical support, along with integrated pest management. \nWMAs will sustain activities through training of in-house extension workers within the WMA. \nServices for fishery development will focus on beels,15 khals (natural channels), and other open \n                                                 \n15 A beel is a water body that accumulates surface runoff water through internal drainage canals. It may dry up during \nthe winter but expands into a large water body during the rainy season. \n ", "8 \nand semi-open water bodies, management of which is improved by water infrastructure. For this \npurpose, a WMA fishery subgroup will be formed with priority membership to the poor who have \nlost access to floodplain fisheries, and will be provided with culture fishery opportunities such as \nthose created in khals behind water retention structures. The relevant public water bodies within \nthe subproject boundaries will be leased out to the concerned WMAs.16  \n \n27.  Livelihood  Enhancement.  The  Project  will  support  income-generating  activities \nundertaken on public lands relevant to the project infrastructure (e.g., canal and embankment \nslopes)  by  the  poorest  subgroups  formed  in  the  WMA,  along  with  other  priority  livelihood \ninitiatives. Specific activities promoted will include social forestry, nurseries, crop cultivation, and \nlivestock.  Training  will  be  provided  through  the  concerned  line  departments  and  private \nproviders mobilized under the Project. In return for project benefits, the beneficiaries will carry \nout necessary routine maintenance activities for the concerned facilities.17  \nd.  Sustainable O&M System \n28.  WMA-Managed Facilities. The project facilities will be classified into those managed by \nWMAs (having a command area of up to 2,500 ha in principle) and others jointly managed by \nBWDB, LGIs, and WMAs. For the former, the Project will establish WMA capacities to manage \nsustainable O&M, and will support formation of WMA O&M committees and preparation of O&M \nplans during the design stage, and will train them to monitor construction. After civil works are \ncompleted, the Project will provide on-the-job training for a full year in undertaking (i) annual \ninspection through a joint walk-through with BWDB, (ii) preparation of the annual O&M plan, and \n(iii) implementation of the plan. During implementation, WMAs will also increase the reserve \nfund established during its formation stage through further beneficiary contribution and fees \ncollected from leaseholders of embankment lands and water bodies. After WMA capacities are \nconfirmed, the WMA will enter into a formal O&M agreement with BWDB, based on which O&M \nresponsibilities are transferred. Annual monitoring of the management and performance of the \nconcerned WMAs will also be supported with technical, social, and financial audits. \n  \n29.  Main Facilities. Regarding the main facilities (defined as flood embankments, and major \nregulators and canals for a command area of over 2,500 ha), the Project will establish a joint \nmanagement system between BWDB, LGIs, and WMAs, following the NWP.18 Specifically, it will \ninstitutionalize (i) preparation of annual O&M plans following a standardized guideline through \njoint inspections with WMAs; and (ii) plan implementation by WMAs for facility operation and \nroutine  preventive  maintenance,  and  by  BWDB  for  periodic  maintenance.  During  its \nimplementation period, the Project will also support O&M, with a declining ADB funding share.   \n \n3.  Part C: Project Management Systems and Institutions Strengthened \n30.  Project Management Systems. To ensure the quality of its output, the Project will \noperate participatory management and quality control systems through the project management \noffice (PMO) and scheme-level subproject management offices (SMOs), with the support of the \nISPMS  consultants.  To  ensure  participatory  implementation  and  O&M  sustainability,  joint \n                                                 \n16 For selected well-performing WMAs, training will also be provided to enhance managerial capacities to facilitate \nimproved farmer access to agriculture inputs and other services collectively to reach better deals with providers. \n17 In addition, a proposal is being prepared to support pilot implementation of point source-based alternative water \nsupply options (for proposed funding of $1 million through the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction) including \nrainwater harvesting, dug wells, pond sand filters, and deep tube wells, for areas where WMA members have little \nnearby access to arsenic-free drinking water. The program will focus on the poorest groups of women.  \n18 Under joint management, WMAs are responsible for facility operation and minor routine preventive maintenance, \nwhereas the project authority is responsible for periodic and emergency maintenance.  \n ", "9 \nmanagement committees (JMCs) will be set up following the NWP and BWDB Act 2000. The \nJMCs will comprise representatives of WMAs, LGIs, BWDB, LGED, and line agencies, along \nwith their subunit-level subcommittees. JMCs and their subcommittees will be trained to make \nsubproject  decisions  at  the  scheme  and  the  subunit  levels,  respectively,  including  project \nprogram delivery and annual O&M, based on which specific works will be undertaken by the \nresponsible organizations, with monitoring by the WMAs. Within this framework, the Project\u2019s \nquality control system ensures (i) due recording and reporting at SMOs on institutional, physical, \nfinancial progress against the specified targets and schedules in IWMPs and SIPs; and (ii) \nregular SMO-PMO review meetings to be operated as part of the internal audit mechanism.   \n31.  Institutions Strengthened through Training and Advisory Support. The Project will \nprovide training to strengthen project institutions, including operating staff and trainers, with a \ndistinct output target to create a pool of professional staff who institutionalize the participatory \nand  integrated  business  processes  embodied  in  the  NWP,  with  progressively  reducing \nconsultancy support that is provided with a clear exit strategy and performance targets for \nrelevant staff positions. Project training will enhance skills for participatory IWMP preparation; \nsocially inclusive WMA development and management; management of diverse stakeholder \ninterests;  resettlement;  design  and  construction  management;  environmental  management; \nagriculture,  fishery,  and  livelihood  enhancement;  sustainable  O&M;  and  quality  control.  In \naddition,  in  coordination  with  other  externally  assisted  programs,  advisory  support  will  be \nprovided for progress of the generic policy and institutional actions (Appendix 5).    \n32.  Management Information Systems (MIS) for Hydrology and FCD/I Performance. \nThe Project will strengthen the MIS in (i) hydrological data collection and sharing, and (ii) FCD/I \nscheme performance in the project subregions. As to the former, the Project will set up water \nuser inventories, strengthen the existing data collection and management system, establish an \ninformation networking system of  salinity data in the dry season for LGIs and water user \nrepresentatives in the project and the downstream areas, and support informed and coordinated \nwater withdrawal.19 The Project will also operate an MIS to regularly monitor the existing FCD/I \nscheme performance including maintenance requirements in its subregions, to be operated \nnationwide in collaboration with other sector projects including the WMIP.   \nC.  Special Features \n33.  The Project will enhance the effectiveness of water sector operations by implementing \nkey policy principles, improving sector governance, and furthering reform actions:   \n(i)  It will operationalize the key principles of the NWP, particularly participatory and \nintegrated planning, development, and management of water to address diverse \nstakeholder  interests,  environmental  concerns,  and  other  local  constraints  on \nagriculture, fishery, and livelihood in the FCD/I areas. Pro-poor focus will be pursued \nwith representation of the vulnerable poor in WMAs and targeted delivery of support.  \n(ii)  It will institutionalize sustainable O&M for medium-sized and large FCD/I schemes, \nwith joint management with and management transfer to WMAs, another key NWP \nprinciple. This follows good practices and lessons proven effective in small FCD/I \nschemes assisted by ADB to support WMA-managed  O&M. A range of agreed \nactions will also be pursued to improve funding of jointly managed facilities (para 42).  \n(iii)  It will operate stringent quality control systems by clearly stipulating process and \nimpact  targets  in  SIPs,  and  progressively  implementing  subproject  works  by \nconfirming the achievement of the predefined targets at each step, with improved \n                                                 \n19 In this context, regular hydrological monitoring of a completed Khulna Jessore drainage rehabilitation project will \nalso be undertaken, along with WMA institutional monitoring and support.  \n ", "10 \nmonitoring and control systems. It will also support broad institutional actions to \nenhance sector governance in coordination with other externally assisted programs. \n(iv)  It will strengthen WMAs as responsible agents to provide self-help efforts for facility \nO&M, and then empower them to take lead roles in subproject decision making and \nmonitor the program delivery, thereby transforming the agency role from implementer \nto service provider. Progressive WMAs will also be trained as a local enterprise with \ncollective bargaining power, facilitating farmer communication with service providers. \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n34.  The total project cost is estimated at about $43.4 million equivalent, of which $9.7 million \n(22%)  represents  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $33.7  million  equivalent  (78%)  the  local \ncurrency cost (Table 1), including taxes and duties of $3.0 million (Appendix 6).   \nTable 1.

Financing Plan \n35.  ADB will provide a loan equivalent to $20.0 million from its Special Funds resources to \nfinance about 46% of the total project cost (Table 2). The ADB loan will finance $6.2 million \nequivalent of the foreign exchange cost including interest charge and $13.8 million equivalent of \nthe local currency cost.20 The Government of the Netherlands is requested to finance about \n29% of the Project cost. The Government of Bangladesh will provide $10.9 million equivalent to \ncover  25%  of  the  total  project  cost.  Interest  during  construction  is  capitalized.  Local  cost \nfinancing is justified, given the poverty-oriented nature of the Project and the tight fiscal situation \n                                                 \n20  With a term of 32 years including a grace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter. \n ", "11 \nin the country.

Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Project Management \n36.  Organization and Management. The Executing Agency of the Project will be BWDB. A \ncentral project coordination office (PCO) will be established in Planning Directorate II with its \ndirector assigned as project coordinator to provide technical backstopping, financial control,  \nfacilitation with central agencies, and coordination with other externally financed projects for \nharmonized support.21 For central coordination, a project steering committee (PSC) will be \nformed comprising representatives of the concerned ministries and agencies.22 The secretary of \nthe Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR) will chair the PSC, with the project coordinator as \nmember secretary. PSC will be held semiannually during the first year and annually from the \nsecond year or whenever required. The organizational structure of the Project is in Appendix 7.  \n37.  Under this central setup, a PMO will be established in BWDB\u2019s southwest zonal office in \nFaridpur. A senior superintending engineer/additional chief engineer having multidisciplinary \nexperience will head the PMO as full-time project director (PD). The PMO will (i) manage an \noverall implementation plan, annual work plans and budgets; (ii) liaise with BWDB, WARPO, \nLGED, and other line agencies for technical backstopping, IWMP clearance (by WARPO), \nmanagerial support, and other central-level activities; (iii) prepare IWMPs of additional FCD/I \nsystems with the support of the relevant SMOs; (iv) liaise with, monitor, and supervise SMOs for \nsubproject implementation; (v) manage financial accounts; and (vi) prepare periodic reports on \nimplementation progress, with the support of the ISPMS consultants. Five SMOs under the \ncontrol of the PMO will be established at the level of individual subprojects,23 building on the \nexisting setup of the concerned BWDB divisional and subdivisional offices supplemented by \nrequired staff. Each SMO will be headed by a senior executive engineer with participatory \nexperience to be appointed as subproject manager. The SMO is responsible for day-to-day \nimplementation activities. It will (i) support the PMO planning unit to prepare IWMPs; (ii) manage \nthe overall subproject implementation plans, annual work plans, and budgets; (iii) prepare and \nimplement SIPs with proper recording and reporting to the PMO; and (iv) coordinate with JMC, \nline departments, LGIs, and NGOs. \n                                                 \n21  WARPO and LGED will assign a principal scientific officer and superintending engineer as project coordinators. \n22  Including the Economic Relations Division, Implementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division, Local Government \nDivision, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Environment and Forests, Ministry of Fishery and Livestock, Ministry of \nLand, Ministry of Water Resources, Planning Commission, Rural Development and Cooperatives Division, and \ntheir line departments concerned, including the Department of Public Health Engineering.   \n23 Two SMOs will be established to implement the two sample subprojects in Narail district.  \n ", "12 \n38.  To  operationalize  participatory  planning,  implementation,  and  O&M,  a  JMC  will  be \nestablished in each subproject. It will have representatives from WMAs, LGIs, and subdistrict \nlevel-line department heads, and be initially chaired by the PD during the planning stage and by \nthe superintending engineer of the BWDB subzonal office after IWMP approval.24 A formal \ninstitutional setup for a permanent JMC will be defined by the time of the midterm review. The \nJMC  will  make  subproject  decisions,  such  as  endorsing  the  IWMP,  annual  and  periodic \nprograms, implementation schedules, and O&M, based on which programs are delivered by the \ndesignated  organizations  under  SMO  management.  Its  subcommittees  will  be  formed  for \npreparing and implementing SIPs with the concerned line departments, LGIs and WMAs.  \n39.  To support coordinated planning and implementation of IWMPs, LGED will (i) provide \ntechnical inputs for preparing IWMPs, (ii) implement small subunits in IWMPs having less than \n1,000 ha command area and limited relations with main FCD/I structures (following the NWP),25 \nand (iii) upgrade rural roads placed on flood embankments identified in IWMPs for joint use. \nThrough their subdistrict offices, DAE and DOF will provide technical inputs for IWMP and SIP \npreparation and extension for agriculture and fishery development, and supervising private \nproviders and NGOs fielded through SMOs. The Ministry of Land will lease the water bodies \nmanaged with subproject structures to the concerned WMAs. The Department of Cooperatives \n(DOC) will provide regulatory support to WMAs while conducting training for their organizational \nmanagement.  The  Department  of  Environment  will  clear  the  subproject  environmental \ndocuments  and  monitor  environmental  impacts.  Specific  cooperation  arrangements  will  be \nagreed upon under individual memorandums of understanding (MOUs) between BWDB/MOWR \nand the concerned agencies within 9 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \n40.  Subproject  Selection  Criteria  and  Implementation  Procedures.  The  Project  will \nprepare and implement  IWMPs for additional FCD/I schemes covering 43,000 ha, following the \nselection criteria in Appendix 8: (i) a benefit area of less than 14,000 ha, (ii) insignificant \nenvironmental impacts duly confirmed, (iii) robust economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of over \n14%, (iv) poverty incidence higher than the national average, and (v) confirmed beneficiary \nwillingness  to  take  over  O&M  responsibility.  Prospective  schemes  with  pre-feasibility \nassessments will be proposed by the PMO and approved by a scheme appraisal subcommittee \n(SASC) placed under the PSC and chaired by WARPO, and then cleared by ADB. The IWMPs \nwill be prepared by the PMO with JMC endorsement, and approved by SASC, WARPO, and \nADB. The implementation procedure (Appendix 9) essentially follows the GPWM. IWMPs will be \nimplemented on the basis of individual subunits, and will follow the steps following the project \ncomponent structure, with engagement of NGOs, CBOs, and private providers.   \n \n41.  WMA Legal Framework. Under the Project, WMAs will be established following the \nlegal framework of the Cooperatives Societies Act (2001) and Cooperative Societies Rules \n(2004) as amended, and the GPWM, and federated at each subproject level. Registration of \nWMAs will authorize them to implement O&M including enforcing resource mobilization from \nbeneficiaries through fees and contributions of labor or in kind. In view of the relatively new \nexperience with legal WMAs, however, the Government plans to study the performance of the \nexisting WMA legal framework, and assess possible measures for improvement including the \npossibility of alternative frameworks.26 The Project through its consultants will review and advise \non the evaluation process and follow-on actions, including the pilot testing of an alternative \nframework. Improved measures may be considered in accordance with the recommendations.    \n                                                 \n24  During the planning stage, the JMC is joined by project coordinators from WARPO and LGED.   \n25 This will be undertaken using the loan funds of the ongoing project for small-scale FCD/I schemes (footnote 7: to \nbe closed in 2009). They cover up to 10% of the two sample scheme areas. \n26 The study will be undertaken in FY2006\u2013FY2007 under the ongoing ADB-assisted project (footnote 7).  \n ", "13 \n42.  Sustainable O&M. Sustaining O&M of FCD/I infrastructures has been a critical sector \nchallenge.27 The NWP and ongoing reforms aim to tackle the issue by (i) rationalizing recurrent \nexpenditure  with  staff  reduction  (by  over  50%)  and  management  transfer  to  WMAs,  (ii) \nenhancing revenues through recovery of O&M cost of public irrigation schemes and leasing of \nembankment and canal lands,28 and (iii) enhancing the O&M budget and its management. The \nProject will harmonize those steps with other programs. Specifically, BWDB is now setting up a \nsound MIS comprising scheme inventories and a monitoring system of scheme performance \nand maintenance needs, for national operation under the Project and other programs including \nWMIP. Based on this MIS, BWDB will introduce a performance-based budget management \nsystem (PBMS) for O&M where allocation is prioritized to well-performing schemes, particularly \nthose following the NWP framework.29 The Government has also recognized the need for \nsufficient maintenance, and BWDB\u2019s repair budgets were annually increased by 15% since \nFY2004, following the Prime Minister\u2019s directive. The Government\u2019s medium-term budgetary \nframework for MOWR, to be finalized in FY2006 following the PRSP, reflects a similar increase, \nalong with the above reform measures. At the scheme level, the Project will set up WMA-\nmanaged O&M following good practices of ADB-assisted project for small FCD/I schemes. The \nProject  will  also  prepare  O&M  manuals  and  undertake  pilot  introduction  of  contracted \nmaintenance. The innovations will enhance the sustainability of the concerned schemes.   \n \n43.  Governance and Anticorruption. Good governance is a critical element for ensuring \nand sustaining the intended benefits from FCD/I renovations. BWDB has established a genuine \nfinancial management system with CIDA support by setting up separate regional accounting \ncenters with computerization.30 Building on this system, the Project will institutionalize stringent \nprocess  and  output  management,  and  internal  and  external  quality  control  mechanisms. \nSpecifically, subprojects will be planned by setting out clear input and output targets in IWMPs \nand SIPs, and progressively implemented by confirming that predefined targets are achieved at \neach stage. WMAs are empowered to endorse SIPs, along with periodic program documents \nwith full information disclosure including expenditures, and to monitor and confirm program \ndelivery.  For  internal  quality  control,  the  Project,  with  the  support  of  the  consultants,  will \ninstitutionalize (i) due recording by SMOs of subproject progress on comprehensive indicators \nincluding construction quality verified with trained WMA representatives, and (ii) monitoring and \nauditing by the PMO. In addition, following the arrangements being introduced under an ADB-\nassisted TA,31 external performance and pilot technical auditing will also be applied through the \nCAG office by engaging private auditors.32 External financial, social, and institutional audit of \nWMAs will also be operated through the DOC in collaboration with the SMO. In these contexts, \nADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was fully explained and discussed with the Government.33   \n \n                                                 \n27  The annual BWDB budget for regular and periodic maintenance is about $35 million (excluding staff costs), and \nremains about 50% of the requirements estimated for functional schemes, on average.   \n28  The NWP does not envisage O&M cost recovery of flood control and drainage facilities (except those transferred to \nWMAs), in view of the public goods nature of the benefits.  \n29 The MIS design and PBMS framework drafting were completed prior to loan negotiations. \n30 BWDB\u2019s financial management was reviewed and found generally satisfactory (Supplementary Appendix H).  \n31  ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Supporting Good Governance \nInitiatives. Manila. \n32  The consultants will further include a provision for random expenditure tracking surveys by external auditors. \n33 Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to \nthe Project. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan \nregulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection \nwith the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts \nof the Executing Agency and all contractors, suppliers, consultants and other service providers as they relate to the \nProject.  \n ", "14 \n2.  Implementation Period \n44.  The project implementation period will be 7 years, starting from April 2006. The two \nsample subprojects will be implemented during the first 6 years through sequential progress in \nWMA institutional development, infrastructure, and support programs in individual subunits. The \nremaining subprojects will be assisted with IWMP preparation in the first 1.5 years, followed by \nimplementation for 3\u20135 years, depending on the scheme size (Appendix 10).  \n3.  Procurement  \n45.  Goods and related services, and civil works to be financed from the ADB loan proceeds \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Vehicles, equipment, \nand materials will be procured by international competitive bidding (ICB) where the estimated \ncost is valued at more than $1 million equivalent, by international shopping for packages from \n$300,000 to $1 million equivalent, or by local competitive bidding (LCB), typically those specified \nin the Government\u2019s Public Procurement Regulations 2003 (PPR), for $300,000 or less. Civil \nworks will be procured in accordance with LCB procedures acceptable to ADB, typically those \nspecified in the PPR. Given the small size of individual contracts (less than $2.0 million), they \nare unlikely to attract international bidders. LCB civil works procurement will follow the single-\nstage, one-envelope procedure with postqualification. Small earthwork contracts valued at less \nthan $8,000 may be awarded to labor contracting societies (LCS) to be formed within the WMA \nwith NGO support. Appendix 11 shows indicative contract packages. \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n46.  The Project will include a consultancy package for ISPMS. It aims to fill capacity gaps to \ndeliver the intended project outputs while institutionalizing the set processes. A total of 72 \nperson-months of international and 532 person-months of domestic consulting services will be \nrequired for this purpose. (Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 12). The consultants will \nbe engaged following the ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory  for  ADB  for  engaging  domestic  consultants,  through  quality-and-cost  based \nselection  procedures  with  advance  recruitment.  The  Government  has  been  advised  that \nadvance action does not commit ADB or the Netherlands Government to finance the Project. In \nview of the nonengineering complexity and the need for early mobilization, ADB will select the \nISPMS  consultants.  The  Project  will  also  require  the  services  of  private  service  providers \nincluding NGOs and firms to (i) carry out participatory rural appraisals for IWMP preparation and \nsocioeconomic surveys; (ii) mobilize subproject stakeholder groups for WMAs; (iii) prepare \nSIPs; (iv) survey, design, and supervise civil works; (v) refine and implement RPs; (v) deliver \nvarious  support  services;  and  (vi)  carry  out  monitoring  and  evaluation  (M&E).  Technically \nqualified providers will be engaged, using selection procedures acceptable to ADB.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n47.  The Government will make funds available to BWDB/PMO through budgetary allocation. \nThe Government of the Netherlands will disburse funds to ADB for administration as jointly \ncofinanced funds. The proceeds for ADB loan and jointly cofinanced funds will be advanced to \nBWDB  and  deposited in  dollar  impressed  accounts  at  the  Bangladesh  Bank  or  any  other \ncommercial bank nominated by the Bangladesh Bank or Ministry of Finance and acceptable to \nADB. The imprest account will be managed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (January 2001), and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and \nADB. The initial amount released to the imprest account will not exceed 6 months of estimated \n ", "15 \nexpenditure and not more than 10% of the total loan amount. To facilitate reimbursement and \nliquidation  of  small  contracts  from  the  imprest  account,  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditure \nprocedure (SOE) will be followed for individual payment transactions not exceeding $50,000.  \n6.  Accounting and Auditing \n48.  BWDB/PCO, PMO, and SMOs will maintain separate records and accounts adequate to \nidentify  the  goods  and  services  financed  from  the  loan  proceeds,  the  financing  resources \nreceived, expenditures incurred for the Project, and the use of local funds, in accordance with \ngenerally accepted accounting principles. Consolidated project accounts and related financial \nstatements will be compiled by BWDB/PCO and audited annually by independent auditors \nacceptable to ADB. The annual audit will include the audit of the imprest account and SOE \nprocedures. A separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE procedures \nwill be included in the annual audit report. The audited accounts, audit report, and related \nfinancial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 months after the close of the fiscal \nyear to which they relate. PMO will resolve all audit opinions within the following 6 months.   \n \n7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation, and Reporting \n49.  M&E of project performance will comprise (i) subproject baseline data and output targets \nset up during IWMP and SIP preparation kept in SMOs and the PMO; (ii) comprehensive \nimplementation-related indicators duly collected and recorded by SMOs and reported to JMC \nand PMO, and periodically audited by the PMO; and (iii) postcompletion performance and \nimpact data collected by SMOs and WMAs kept in SMOs and the PMO. The system will \nestablish a set of monitorable targets and indicators for results-based management following the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1) with dynamic adjustment, and disaggregated \ndata by gender and landholding size. Implementation monitoring will integrate financial and non-\nfinancial aspects. The PMO will establish an effective MIS within 1 year of loan effectiveness \nand will prepare and submit quarterly progress reports and annual benefit monitoring reports to \nADB. A detailed study will be conducted to review project progress before the midterm review \n(MTR). An impact evaluation study will be undertaken in preparing a project completion report, \nwhich will be submitted to ADB within 3 months after the physical completion of the Project. \n \n8.  Project Review \n50.  MOWR, ADB, and the Government of the Netherlands will review the project at least \ntwice a year. The regular reviews will cover the performance of BWDB and other institutions, \nloan covenants including implementation of the policy and institutional action plans and gender \naction plan, and physical progress of project implementation. A comprehensive MTR in year 3 \nwill evaluate (i) project progress including quality of services delivered, (ii) impacts of economic \nand other indicators, (iii) effectiveness of project management and implementation, (iv) progress \nin policy and institutional actions, and (v) future implementation plan and targets.34 The project \ndesign and implementation arrangements will be adjusted as necessary. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Economic Impacts \n51.  At full development, the Project will rehabilitate a gross area of 100,000 ha (of which \nabout 73,000 ha is cultivated land) of FCD/I schemes suffering form low productivity and a high \n                                                 \n34  The Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation Division will also undertake midterm evaluation of the Project.  \n ", "16 \nincidence of poverty. About 150,000 households will benefit from improved livelihood activities. \nRehabilitation  will  decrease  flooding,  improve  drainage,  and  increase  irrigation.  The \nimprovement will allow farmers to increase cropping intensity and improve crop yields. With \nbetter flood protection, an increase in culture fishery production is also expected. These will \ninduce a demand for hired labor and benefit the poor who have little, if any, land. Major \nquantified benefits are shown in Appendix 13. Nonquantified benefits include operation of sound \ninstitutions  for  IWMP  preparation,  implementation,  and  O&M;  improved  sector  governance \nthrough institutional strengthening; and increased traffic on improved embankment roads.  \n52.  Financial and economic analyses were carried out for the two sample subprojects. The \nChenchuri Beel subproject covers 17,900 ha of net cultivated area and Narail, 23,400 ha. While \nthey are protected by the existing flood embankments built in the early 1980s35 and that have \nremained functional without further external aid, their productivity is affected by degraded main \ninfrastructure and lack of minor water control facilities to address local problems. The Project \nwill increase cropping intensity by 15% to about 220%, with modest improvements in yield \n(primarily through shifts to high yielding varieties of paddy and other crops) resulting in annual \noutputs increasing by 54,800 t. Culture fish production will also increase by 1,200 t. Annual \nO&M demand is estimated to cost $0.48 million, of which BWDB and WMAs will bear about \n70%  and  30%,  respectively.  While  BWDB\u2019s  present  national  O&M  budget  is  short  of  the \nestimated demand by up to 50%, the gap will be addressed by the actions synthesized in para. \n42. WMA contribution amounts to less than 10% of incremental farmer incomes, a comparable \nlevel pursued and practiced in the LGED project assisted by ADB. The estimated EIRR is 16.5% \nfor Chenchuri Beel and 21.2% for Narail. Sensitivity analysis to test the impacts of a range of \nrisks including in investment costs, output prices, yields, and project life showed that project \nreturns are generally robust. The greatest risk appears to be reduction in price of food grains in \nChenchuri Beel, but even a drop of 20% in its price will still produce an EIRR of 12%.36  \n \nB.  Household and Poverty Reduction Impacts \n53.  The  Project  will  have  positive  poverty  reduction  impacts  on  income,  employment \nopportunities including those for tenant farmers and sharecroppers (that are arising from labor \nconstraints experienced by larger farmers), and food security. According to the socioeconomic \nsurvey, poverty incidence in the two subproject areas is about 55%, and is concentrated among \nthose in agriculture, fishery, and labor as primary occupation, and among landless and marginal \nand small farmers with up to 1 ha landholding. Annual incremental crop income will be 16\u201318% \nfor all sizes of farms. Increase in hired labor income will be 14\u201316% and will go almost entirely \nto marginal and landless households. In local financial terms, 43\u201346% of incremental income \ndue to the Project will go to the poor. \n   \nC.  Social and Gender Development Strategy \n54.  The Project is highly participatory in design and will be implemented following a process \napproach involving all stakeholders in decision making. Appendix 14 gives the summary poverty \nreduction and social development strategy. The project subregion does not have any indigenous \npeoples. The specific strategy includes (i) pro-poor procedures and guidelines for beneficiary \nselection and employment; (ii) membership and credit access to WMAs; (iii) WMA participation \nin design, planning, implementing, and monitoring with inclusive by-laws; (iv) a comprehensive \ncapacity development plan highlighting project staff, WMAs, and village groups; (v) guidelines \n                                                 \n35  Original investment for Chenchuri Beel was funded by the World Bank, whereas a part of that for Narail was funded \nby the Government of the Netherlands. \n36  The minimum project life that generates justifiable EIRR is 11 years for Narail and 12.5 years for Chenchuri Beel. \n ", "17 \nfor social activities such as conflict resolution, anti-dowry drives, and women representation; \nand (vi) procedures for networking and linkages among WMAs and service- providing agencies. \nThe strategy will also establish consultative platforms at the village level for LGIs and NGOs \nbefore appropriate interventions are planned for water infrastructure, farming and nonfarming \nproduction, and income generation. Training will be provided for leadership and confidence \nbuilding to enable the poor and women\u2019s groups to form WMAs capable of infrastructure O&M. \nVillage facilitators will also be selected and trained. Procedures for coordination among LGI \nrepresentatives, NGOs, and WMAs will also be established for effective service delivery.  \n55.  The  Project\u2019s  gender  action  plan  (Appendix  15),  to  be  further  adjusted  during  its \nimplementation, includes (i) employment of female staff at all levels and training for field staff in \ngender-sensitive  and  participatory  planning  and  project  implementation;  (ii)  employment \nopportunities for women generated by the project and O&M works, and training for all aspects of \nO&M; (iii) training for women's work in farm and homestead production; (iv) strengthening the \nextension  system  to  become  gender-equitable;  (v)  response  to  women's  agricultural  and \nhousehold needs for technology in close collaboration with implementing agencies and NGOs; \n(vi) support for women in their home-based postharvest production, processing, and marketing \nactivities by providing local market information and linkages; and (vii) training for women in crop \nand horticulture production, postharvest operations, poultry and small livestock rearing, social \nforestry, fisheries production and processing, credit, seed production, and nutrition education. \nGender-specific monitoring indicators will also be set up to support the plan. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n56.  An environmental impact assessment (EIA) was carried out during the PPTA for the two \nsample FCD/I schemes in view of their large geographic coverage.37 The Project will have \npositive impacts on the environment, including (i) improved flood management; (ii) improved \nwater use efficiency through water retention and storage, with reduced pressure on groundwater \nextraction; (iii) reduced salinity intrusion through water regulating structures, thereby preventing \nland degradation; and (iv) reduced waterlogging through drainage improvement. On the other \nhand, negative impacts will include (i) possible exacerbation of downstream salinity intrusion \ndue to excessive river water abstraction, (ii) obstruction of fish migration between the rivers and \ninternal water bodies by regulators and other structures, (iii) deterioration of water quality due to \nagriculture intensification, and (iv) impacts during construction of structures and embankments. \nThe impacts are mitigated by (i) implementing salinity monitoring and an information sharing \nprogram in the project and downstream areas with promotion of coordinated water abstraction, \n(ii) introducing and promoting fish-friendly design and operation of regulators with provision for \nfish culture opportunities, (iii) introducing integrated pest management and effective soil nutrient \nmanagement; and (iv) ensuring safe and environmentally sound construction practices. These \nare incorporated in the EIA and the summary EIA.  \n \n57.  The overall responsibility for environmental management is with the PMO, with the \nexperienced executive engineer assigned as chief resettlement and environmental manager, \nassisted  by  the  consultants.  In  the  SMO,  a  subdivisional  engineer  will  be  assigned  as \nenvironmental  officer  responsible  for  field  management  and  reporting,  with  monitoring  and \nsupport by PMO and the consultants. For further subprojects, initial environmental examinations \n(IEEs) and EIAs, if required following the IEEs, will be undertaken by the PMO with consultant \nsupport,  in  accordance  with  Government  and  ADB  requirements,  and  following  the  EIA \nprepared for sample subprojects. All IEEs/EIAs will be endorsed by the Government and ADB.  \n                                                 \n37 The summary EIA was circulated to the Board on 14 July 2005. \n ", "18 \nE.  Resettlement \n58.   In the two sample subprojects, land acquisition and resettlement needs associated with \nwater infrastructure works were studied during the PPTA. A resettlement framework (RF) and \nsample  RPs  were  prepared,  following  ADB\u2019s  involuntary  resettlement  and  other  social \nsafeguards  policies.  Subproject  implementation  will  require  strip  acquisition  of  land  for \nresectioning and realigning embankments and placement of structures, totaling 56 ha of land in \nthe sample subprojects. Under the Project, the RF will be followed, and all affected persons \n(APs) will be entitled to compensation for land taken for the purpose of the project interventions, \nfor  lost  assets,  and  for  incomes  at  replacement  cost  to  improve  or  at  least  restore  their \npreproject living standards, income levels, and productive capacity. The PMO will supervise RP \npreparation and implementation by the concerned SMO through private firms and NGOs, with \nthe  support  of  the  consultants.  The  RPs  as  prepared  with  IWMPs  as  well  as  those  for \nfinalization with detailed designs will be sent to ADB for approval. In implementing the RPs, a \ngrievance redressing mechanism with representatives from the PMO, APs, LGIs, and the NGO \nwill be established. The PMO will prepare and submit to ADB an annual report on the land \nacquisition and resettlement issues. An independent M&E agency will also be engaged to \nassess performance and impacts. The provisional cost estimate for resettlement is about $3.4 \nmillion equivalent. Appendix 16 gives the summary RF and RPs. \n \nF.  Risks \n59.  The Project has certain risks that could adversely affect effective implementation and \nsustainable benefits. It has incorporated mitigating measures to the maximum extent possible. \n \n60.  Insufficient Stakeholder Participation. There is a possibility that the concerned WMAs \nmay not sufficiently represent stakeholders with diverse interests in the subunit area, and fail to \noperate water management facilities equitably with due coordination. To avoid the risk, the \nProject will ensure at least 70% of the beneficiary households will be enrolled in WMAs prior to \nphysical works of the subunit, an approach followed in ADB-assisted project for small-scale \nFCD/I  schemes  implemented  by  LGED.  It  will  also  ensure  due  representation  of  different \nstakeholders, particularly the poor in the WMA committees. Intensive monitoring will be provided \nthrough the SMO, the ISPMS consultants, and the DOC for sound operation of WMAs.  \n61.  Sustainability\u2013Output Quality and O&M. Sustaining the project impacts will require \ndelivering quality outputs with effective interagency coordination and governance on the one \nhand, and sustainable O&M on the other. The former will be pursued by ensuring stringent \nprocess and output management with a participatory approach. Interagency coordination will be \naddressed by stipulating specific agency roles in the MOUs and providing necessary funding to \nsupport those roles. Output quality will be further enhanced through strengthened internal and \nexternal  quality  control  mechanisms  with  capacity  development,  including  (i)  a  sound  MIS \noperated by SMOs with proper programming, recording, and reporting in light of defined IWMP/ \nSIP targets; (ii) improved internal auditing mechanisms operated by the PMO; (iii) monitoring \nand confirmation of program delivery and outputs by WMAs; and (iv) external performance and \ntechnical auditing applied by the CAG office. On the other hand, O&M sustainability is pursued \nthrough comprehensive measures, including enhanced overall O&M budget and its improved \nscheme-wise management at the policy level, and increased WMA participation in O&M at the \nfield level. All measures will contribute to overall project sustainability.    \n62.  BWDB Management Capacity for Participatory Water Management. Past projects \nhave  generally  demonstrated  the  insufficient  capacity  of  BWDB  in  participatory  water \n ", "19 \nmanagement. However, BWDB is adopting decentralization, participation, client orientation, and \nmultisectoral coordination as key elements of its institutional vision, and has launched holistic \naction plans with the harmonized support of external funding agencies. In line with this, the \nProject will provide support for their effective implementation, with the objective of having BWDB \nprogressively  develop  the  capacity  to  operate  participatory  procedures,  arrangements,  and \nmanagement systems. To address the human resources gap, the Project will institutionalize \noutsourcing arrangements to private service providers to support the social mobilization process \nand other nonengineering functions, with the assistance of the ISPMS consultants. \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n63.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and BWDB have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n(i)  The Government will undertake all time bound policy and institutional actions as \nspecified in Appendix 5, agreed upon with ADB.  \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that all subprojects meet the selection criteria and \nimplementation arrangements and procedures as specified in Appendixes 8\u20139. \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that WMAs under the Project will be established in \naccordance with the Cooperatives Societies Act (2001) and Cooperative Societies \nRules (2004) as amended from time to time, and the GPWM, or any other legal \nframework satisfactory to ADB. \n(iv)  Upon  completion  of  a  subproject  program,  the  Government  will  transfer  to  the \nconcerned WMAs the O&M responsibility for the subproject\u2019s water management \nstructures with command area of less than 2,500 ha, or as otherwise agreed upon by \nthe Government and ADB. To support the process, the Government will ensure that \nthe  implementation  agreement  with  the  WMA  is  signed  only  after  achieving  (a) \nmembership  enrollment  of  over  70%  of  direct  beneficiary  households,  (b)  full \ncollection  of  up-front  cash  contribution  equivalent  to  annual  O&M  costs  of  the \nfacilities to be managed by the WMA, and (c) agreement among members on the \noperational rules of water control structures.   \n(v)  The Government will ensure that the share of ADB and the Government of the \nNetherlands funding for infrastructure O&M will be phased out starting from 60% in \nyear 3 of loan effectiveness and reduced by 20% in year 5 and year 7, respectively.  \n(vi)  The Government will ensure that land acquisition and resettlement activities are \nimplemented  in  accordance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nGovernment, and ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement, as set out in the agreed-\nupon RF and RP. The Government will ensure that, in case of any discrepancies \nbetween Bangladesh\u2019s laws, regulations, and/or procedures and ADB\u2019s requirements \nincluding the Policy on involuntary resettlement, ADB\u2019s policy will apply. BWDB will \nensure  that  (a)  the  PMO  and  SMOs  have  resettlement  staff  throughout  project \nimplementation; (b) Narail and Chenchuri Beel subproject RPs are updated based on \ndetailed technical design, disclosed to APs, and submitted to ADB for approval; (c) \nother subproject RPs are prepared based on detailed technical design, disclosed to \nAPs and the ADB website, and submitted to ADB for approval in accordance with the \nRF agreed upon by ADB and the Borrower; (d) the PMO will submit the progress and \ncompletion reports on land acquisition and resettlement that will be included in the \nfinancial audit statements for each subproject; and (e) the external monitor\u2019s contract \nstates that monitoring reports will be submitted simultaneously to ADB and BWDB. \nBWDB will not award contracts for any construction work unless the concerned RP \n ", "20 \nas required has been submitted to and approved by BWDB and ADB. BWDB will not \naward any contract unless the RP has been fully implemented.  \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that adequate environmental mitigating measures are \nincorporated  into  the  subproject  design,  construction,  O&M,  and  monitoring \narrangements in the form of environmental management plans in accordance with \n(a) the Environmental Policy of the Asian Development Bank (2002), and (b) the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental laws and regulations, and following the EIA prepared \nfor  the  sample  subprojects,  including  semiannual  progress  reporting  of \nenvironmental issues. The Government will ensure that the IEE/EIAs are included in \nthe  subproject  feasibility  study  reports.  The  IEE/EIA  will  be  endorsed  by  the \nGovernment. The EIA will also be sent to ADB for concurrence.  \n(viii)  The Government will ensure (a) achievement of at least 33% representation by \nwomen  in  WMAs  on  average,  (b)  implementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  in \nAppendix  15,  and  (c)  due  representation  of  diverse  stakeholders  in  WMAs  in \naccordance with the household distribution in the subproject areas. \n  \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness  \n64.  In  addition  to  the  general  conditions,  the  Government  will  have  (i)  approved  the \ndevelopment project proposal satisfactory to ADB, through the Executive Committee to the \nNational Economic Council; (ii) established the PCO and PMO with the designation of the \nproject  coordinator  and  the  project  director,  along  with  other  key  executive  staff;  and  (iii) \nobtained confirmation from the Government of the Netherlands that the Netherlands grant has \nbeen approved.   \nC.  Conditions for Withdrawal from the Loan Account  \n65.   No withdrawals from the loan account will be made until the grant fund provided by the \nGovernment of the Netherlands has become effective.

Background and Issues  \n \n1.  Bangladesh is in an alluvial deltaic floodplain in the confluence of three major rivers\u2013the \nGanges (Padma), Brahmaputra (Jamuna), and Meghna\u2013which have a catchment area of 1.74 \nmillion square kilometers (km2). The rivers cause substantial seasonal variability of flows, posing \nkey physical challenges of (i) severe flooding, which not only inundates up to two thirds of the \ncountry  but  also  fills  river  channels  with  sediment  and  erodes  riverbanks,  causing  social \nhardships to the people along the rivers; (ii) limited water during the dry season and expanding \nwater  demand;  (iii)  saline  intrusion  and  environmental  degradation;  (iv) cyclones  and  tidal \nsurges  that  decimate  lives  and  property  in  the  coastal  areas;  and  (v) widespread  arsenic \ncontamination of groundwater. With the dense population and high poverty incidence, water \nmanagement is further complicated by diverse interests among traditional livelihood activities of \nthe rural poor including agriculture, fisheries, transportation, industries, and water supply, with \nwhich poverty is deeply associated. Water is also essential for the country\u2019s vulnerable natural \necosystems. Hence it is paramount for the country to manage this critical resource in an \nintegrated and strategic manner ensuring stakeholder participation. \n \n2.  The National Water Resources Council (NWRC), chaired by the Prime Minister, is the \nhighest authority governing water resources management. The key agencies include the Water \nResources Planning Organization (WARPO), which is responsible for policy formulation and \nmacrolevel planning and coordination; the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB),1 \nresponsible for water resource projects exceeding 1,000 hectares (ha) of command area and \nhydrology monitoring; and the Local Government Engineering Department (LGED), responsible \nfor projects below 1,000 ha.2 In general, there is a dire need for sound and integrated water \nresources management; however, the country\u2019s sector policies and institutional framework and \ncapacities have been unable to meet the diverse challenges effectively. Key institutional issues \ninclude (i) weakness in participatory, integrated, and strategic planning; (ii) lack of agency \ncapacity  to  implement  water  resource  interventions  with  sufficient  support  to  participatory \nprocesses while ensuring the quality of outputs; (iii) lack of coordination in delivering necessary \nsupport services to achieve intended economic benefits in agriculture and fisheries; (iv) deficient \noperation and maintenance (O&M) due to lack of beneficiary participation and chronic shortage \nof funds for O&M; and (v) insufficient operational transparency and accountability. \n \nB.  Government\u2019s Policy, Strategy, and Reform Initiatives  \n \n3.  In 1995, the Government launched a major initiative toward establishing a sound policy, \nplanning, institutional, and legal framework for the sector. The critical need was recognized  \nafter the outcome of the Flood Action Plan (FAP) studies and pilot projects, which involved \ncoordinated assistance from 16 external funding agencies including ADB between 1990 and \n1995. Accordingly, the National Water Policy (NWP) was prepared and approved in 1999. It \n                                                 \n1  Under the policy guidance of the Governing Council, BWDB is headed by a director general (DG) and comprises \nfive departments (finance, administration, planning, and two operation and maintenance [O&M] divisions). Field-\nlevel operations are executed by its 60 hydrological division offices across the country through their subordinate \nsub-divisional offices, which are under 19 superintending engineers, seven chief engineers, and two additional \nDGs for O&M. There are 1,016 class I posts (mostly engineers and account staff, and a small number of non-\nengineers) and 7,844 other posts.   \n2  LGED is responsible for all types of local government infrastructure, including rural roads. It is headed by a chief \nengineer (CE) at its headquarters having two additional CEs and six subject matter superintending engineers for \ntechnical backstopping and quality control. Projects are executed by its 61 district-level executive offices through \n465 subdistrict offices placed under 10 superintending engineers. There are 9,628 posts.   \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \nestablished the sector goals and guidelines to effectively manage these critical resources, and \nadopted the principles of integrated water resources management (IWRM) with emphasis on \nstakeholder participation, strategic planning, decentralization, sound management of social and \nenvironmental issues, sustainable O&M through management transfer to water management \nassociations (WMAs), and autonomy, transparency, and accountability of sector institutions. \nBWDB institutional reforms have made certain progress, including (i) restructuring of the board \nof directors into a governing council that includes stakeholder representatives to decide on \npolicy issues; (ii) long-term assignment of leadership; (iii) staff rationalization (from 18,032 to \n8,860  between  1999  and  2006);  and  (iv)  diversification  of  the  skills  mix  to  increase  non-\nengineers  such  as  agronomists,  fishery  and  environment  specialists.  LGED  has  also \nestablished an Integrated Water Resources Unit while strengthening the skills mix to meet the \ndiverse socio-environmental needs of the stakeholders. On the legal and regulatory side, a \nnational water act under preparation will comprehensively govern the use and management of \nwater. Guidelines for participatory water management (GPWM) have been finalized, stipulating \nmanagement transfer and for local participation arrangements in water resources schemes.  \n4.  The Government also prepared and approved in 2004 a national water management \nplan (NWMP), which provides a framework for short-(5 years), medium-(10 years), and long-(25 \nyears) term strategy and priority programs. Building on the NWP, the NWMP established eight \nfocal agendas3 and identified 84 national-level programs proposed for implementation over the \nnext 25 years. In the short term, it heavily focuses on institutional development and an enabling \nenvironment, along with critically urgent investment programs. Building on the NWMP, the \nGovernment\u2019s  National  Strategy  for  Economic  Growth,  Poverty  Reduction  and  Social \nDevelopment (March 2003), or interim poverty reduction strategy paper, prioritized (i) promoting \nrational management and optimal use of water resources; (ii) improving the quality of life by \nensuring equitable, safe, and reliable access to water for production, health and hygiene; and \n(iii) ensuring availability of clean water in sufficient quantities for multiple uses, and preserving  \nthe aquatic and water-dependent ecosystems. Investment priorities specified for the rural water \nresources sector include (i) saving properties and lives by controlling river erosion, monsoon \nflooding, and saline water intrusion; (ii) improving irrigation and reducing drainage congestion, \nand  mitigating  drought  by  reexcavating  canals  and  watercourses;  (iii)  rationalizing  existing \nprojects while promoting stakeholder participation and multiple uses of flood embankments; and \n(iv) mitigating the impacts of arsenic contamination of groundwater. \nC.  ADB\u2019s Experience and Activities of Other Development Partners \n5.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided 33 technical assistance and 19 loan \nprojects amounting to $20 million and $675 million, respectively, since 1977. Recent assistance \nafter 1995 has increasing focus on improving the policy and institutional environment in support \nof  the  development  of  critical  infrastructure;  drainage  improvement  in  coastal  areas; \nimprovement of large-scale flood control, drainage/irrigation (FCD/I) schemes; application of \nlower cost erosion mitigation in major rivers to protect  agricultural lands; and stakeholder-driven \nsmall-scale water resources infrastructure. Performance has been generally mixed\u2013large-scale \nprojects  had  faced  weak  stakeholder  participation  and  O&M,  although  there  are  signs  of \nimprovement  along  with  the  progress  of  BWDB  reforms.  On  the  other  hand,  small-scale \ninterventions executed by LGED has been more satisfactory, having developed an increasing \nnumber of well-performing schemes with sound WMA management.  \n                                                 \n3  Including (i) institutional development, (ii) enabling framework, (iii) main river development, (iv) towns and rural \nareas, (v) major cities, (vi) disaster management, (vii) agriculture and water management, and (viii) natural \nenvironment and aquatic resources.  \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n6.  ADB has played an important role in promoting the recent sector reforms, in cooperation \nwith other development partners. Specifically, ADB\u2019s assistance for small-scale water resources \ndevelopment encouraged the Government to decentralize such schemes to local governments \nand WMAs, which step was adopted as a key principle of the NWP. The WMA legal framework \nwas  established  through  an  amendment  of  the  Cooperatives  Act.  Its  procedures  and \narrangements were also used as a model followed in the GPWM. The ongoing assistance for \nmitigating river erosion also aims to establish a leading model to apply key NWP principles, \nincluding cost recovery in irrigation O&M, and a transparent and accountable joint management \nframework among BWDB, local governments, and WMAs. The impacts of ADB investments \nhave also been positive, resulting in increased agricultural production and livelihood security \nfrom natural disasters such as floods, although they were less than anticipated at appraisal in \ngeneral and call for more effective integration with other essential support services such as \nagriculture and fisheries extension. Environmental impacts were evaluated as either benign or \npositive, but the early projects that substantially altered floodplain regimes had negative impacts \non open water fisheries despite large agricultural benefits and livelihood security.  \n \n7.   The World Bank has provided 27 loans amounting to about $1.045 billion. Recent \nassistance focused on the preparation of the draft NWMP, rehabilitation of medium- to large-\nscale coastal embankments and of inland FCD/I schemes, and riverbank protection along the \nright bank of the Jamuna River. Significant emphasis has been placed on policy dialogues for \npreparing the NWP, and reforms in the organizational structure of BWDB. The World Bank is in \nthe final process of approving the Water Management Improvement Project (WMIP), which aims \nto assist further institutional reforms of WARPO and BWDB with capacity development, and to \nimprove the existing medium- to large-scale FCD/I schemes while establishing WMAs that will \ntake over the O&M of smaller facilities from BWDB, though a sector project modality.  \n \n8.  The Government of the Netherlands has also been a major development partner in the \nsector  since  1975.  Recent  efforts  have  substantially  increased  emphasis  on  policy  and \ninstitutional development while supporting three strategic subsectors: (i) socioeconomic and \nenvironmental restoration of the Ganges-dependent area, (ii) integrated coastal zone planning \nand management, and (iii) small-scale water resources development in partnership with ADB. A \nmajor contribution being provided is to jointly develop and implement a 5-year action plan to \nfurther  BWDB  reforms  in  seven  key  agendas,  through  a  twinning  arrangement  with  the \nconcerned ministry in The Hague. The action plans have provided a common and practical \nframework to improve the organizational management of BWDB, and are now pursued in all \nongoing  and  planned  assistance  by  external  funding  agencies.  The  Government  of  the \nNetherlands is also to provide cofinancing to WMIP and the proposed Project, and is also \npromoting further expansion of the action plan to install sound planning, prioritization, and \nmanagement systems beyond which a sectorwide program approach of support is envisaged.   \n \nD.  ADB\u2019s Strategy \n \n9.  Over the last 5 years, Bangladesh has put in place a sound NWP, prepared a draft 25-\nyear NWMP, and initiated organizational reforms of the key sector institutions. The country has \nthus  entered  into  a  phase  of  consolidating  the  reform  efforts  to  effectively  institutionalize  \nimproved policy, planning, and institutional frameworks into sound sector operations.  \n \n10.  Under the circumstance, ADB\u2019s sector strategy is to support the Government\u2019s efforts in \nthat  direction.  Specifically,  ADB  will  support  further  development  of  sound  policies  and \ninstitutional framework, and the capacities and management systems the sector institutions to \nimplement the framework. The aim will be to implement integrated water resources planning \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \nand  management,  and  sustainable  service  delivery,  with  decentralization  and  stakeholder \nparticipation and empowerment including O&M contribution. Emphasis will also be on strategic \nplanning  and  coordinated  delivery  of  essential  services  (such  as  agriculture  and  fishery \nextension) to ensure the intended benefits, and addressing the concerns of the poor in water \nsector interventions. Support for critical investments is provided following the NWMP priorities, \nand  demonstrated  progress  of  essential  reform  actions  and  their  operations.  During  this \nprocess, particular attention will be paid to strengthen partnership among the Government, \nexternal  funding  agencies,  and  the  private  sector  including  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs)  and  stakeholders.  More  specific  agendas  and  the  strategy  of  ADB\u2019s  water  sector \nassistance are as follows.  \n  1.  Policy and Institutional Reform  \n11.  Policy and institutional reform, and its full implementation are the major focus of ADB\u2019s \nsupport for the water resources sector. ADB\u2019s assistance in the reform process is given in a \nprogressive manner based on agreed-on goals, and with emphasis on national ownership of the \nreform process. Issues to be pursued include the following: \n(i)  Improving the policy, planning, and legal framework. While the NWP and NWMP \nprovide  an  effective  framework  for  IWRM  and  sustainable  service  delivery, \nprogressive  improvements  are  needed,  with  regular  sector  operational  review. \nLikewise,  a  comprehensive  national  water  act  is  awaited,  in  which  appropriate \nregulatory institutions for managing water quantity and quality should be defined.  \n(ii)  Fostering  IWRM  and  water  conservation.  Issues  include  (a)  establishing  an \ninstitutional framework for IWRM including integrated planning, water quantity and \nquality management including affluent disposal standards, and floodplain zoning; and \n(b) improving guidelines such as GPWM and those for environmental examination. \n(iii)  Improving service delivery and sustaining O&M. Issues include (a) operating \ninstitutional  mechanisms  for  management  transfer  and  local  O&M  financing;  (b) \ndefining effective roles of local governments in this context; (c) further developing an \nappropriate  WMA  institutional  modality,  including  a  legal  framework;  and  (d) \nimproving budgetary management mechanisms for sound O&M performance. \n(iv)  Improving  governance.  Issues  include  (a)  enhancing  transparency  and \naccountability  in  agency  operations;  (b)  strengthening  anticorruption  efforts  with \nenhanced internal and external quality control for infrastructure and other services; \nand (c) improving the regulatory framework of WMA management to provide annual \nsocial, technical, and financial audit.     \n2.  Investments \n12.  Investments in software and hardware will be guided by the following considerations. \n(i)  Integrated water resources planning and management. Following the NWP and \nthe NWMP, support will be provided for integrated water resources planning at local \nlevels and priority investments identified, with necessary measures to ensure their \nsustainable O&M, and focus to meet the needs of the poor and the vulnerable.4  \n(ii)  Small-scale water resources development. Support for further consolidation of \nsmall-scale interventions will be prioritized, with added attention to their strategic \nimplementation following subregional plans, and delegation of increasing power of \nproject operations to local governments, with further reorganization of LGED. \n                                                 \n4  In this context, assistance for rural mitigation of arsenic in groundwater is also considered, to promote the \nidentification and adoption of water supply options. \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n(iii)  Improvement and management transfer of BWDB\u2019s FCD/I schemes. This thrust \nis supported building on the lessons in small-scale schemes, and strengthening \nWMA for sustainable O&M. Support for irrigation schemes is contingent on the sound \nprogress of O&M cost recovery in ongoing projects. \nE.  Implications for the Present Project Design \u2013 Implementing Policy Framework with \nCapacity Strengthening \n13.  Following the sector strategy, the proposed Project is designed to meet the critical \ninvestment thrusts in selected subregions in the southwest area by building on and furthering \nthe policy and institutional reforms (specific actions are in Appendix 5). Despite the progressive \ndevelopment of the policy and institutional framework in recent years, however, there is still a \nwide gap between the framework and individual sector agency operations, calling for careful \ncapacity strengthening support to address the critical weaknesses as pointed out in paragraph \n2, viz., agency capacities to implement the improved framework are still at the early stages of \ndevelopment. Accordingly, the following specific measures are pursued under the Project\u2013with \nintensive support by the consultants\u2013to institutionalize them within BWDB: \n(i)  Participatory and coordinated planning and implementation. In each scheme, a \njoint management committee (JMC) will be formed with the assigned staff of BWDB, \nline departments, LGIs, and WMAs. At the outset, an integrated water management \nplan  (IWMP)  and  individual  subunit  implementation  plans  (SIPs),  prepared  with \nconsultant support, will set out clear program schedules, institutional responsibilities, \nand output targets.5 Those plans and their periodic work plans will be endorsed by \nJMC and its SIP subcommittees, particularly the concerned WMAs, based on which \nspecific programs will be delivered through the designated agencies following the \nIWMP and SIPs. \n(ii)  WMA strengthening and sustainable O&M. To address critical managerial and \nresource constraints in BWDB, WMAs will be formed and strengthened by engaging \nlocal community organizers and NGOs trained through the consultants. To ensure \nsufficient  WMA  development  and  attention  by  agency  staff,  WMAs  will  have  to \nachieve  specific  institutional  development  targets  as  set  out  in  the  SIPs  at \npreconstruction stage, including enrollment by over 70% of beneficiary farmers, full \nachievement of financial contribution to establish an O&M reserve fund, and genuine \norganizational  management.  WMAs  will  be  trained  in  system  operation,  and \nmonitoring,  planning,  and  implementing  maintenance  works  with  O&M  fund \nreplenishment. Sustainability of scheme-level O&M will be attained through generic \npolicy  and  operational  measures  which  are  being  pursued  with  other  externally \nassisted programs and to be operated nationwide.  \n(iii)  Monitoring  and  quality  control. The subproject management office (SMO) will \nregularly hold progress review meetings with the JMC and its subcommittees with \nthe participation of the concerned WMAs, which are designated to monitor and \nconfirm the quality of the delivered services. For quality control purposes, the SMO \nwill duely record and report on subproject progress that is monitored and audited by \nthe project management office, in the light of the IWMPs and SIPs that specify clear \ninput, process, and output indicators and targets. Along with these, an external \nperformance  and  technical  audit  will  be  undertaken  through  the  Office  of  the \nComptroller and Auditor General. \n                                                 \n5  A generic memorandum of understanding will also be established between BWDB and line departments to specify \nthe collaboration sought from the latter and specific resources provided through BWDB.   \n ", "30  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO RURAL WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT \n(after 1995)a \nFunding Amount ($million)\nProject Title Year\nSource Grant  Loan\nADB Southwest Area Water Resources Management Studyb 3.8 \u2013 1991\nSouthwest Area Water Resources Development c 0.3 3.2 1993\nSmall-scale Water Resources Development Sector \u2013 32.0 1995\nCommand Area Development \u2013 30.0 1995\nFlood Damage Rehabilitation d \u2013 20.0 1998\nSouthwest Flood Damage Rehabilitation d \u2013 13.2 2000\nSecond Small-scale Water Resources Development Sector \u2013 34.0 2001\nJamuna-Meghna River Erosion Mitigation \u2013 42.2 2002\nEmergency Flood Damage Rehabilitation d \u2013 31.8 2005\nCanada Kalni-Kushiyara Community Development 1.8 \u2013 1997\nModernization of BWDB's Accounting Phase II 1.7 \u2013 1997\nDampara Water Management 2.9 \u2013 1998\nModernization of MOWR Financial Management 2.2 \u2013 1999\nEnvironmental Monitoring Information Network 3.7 \u2013 2003\nDenmark Flood Forecasting and Warning 3.2 \u2013 2000\nGermany Riverbank Protection and Training Phase II 2003\nJapan Narayanganj Narsingdi FCDI Phase III Study 0.3 \u2013 1998\nNetherlands Small-scale Water Resources Development Sector 6.8 \u2013 1996\nMeghna Estuary Study 7.5 \u2013 1996\nEnvironmental GIS Support Phase II 7.6 \u2013 1997\nGorai River Restoration 45.0 \u2013 1998\nChar Development and Settlement Support Phase II 9.0 \u2013 1998\nSecond Small-scale Water Resources Development Sector 24.3 \u2013 2001\nIntegrated Coastal Zone Management Program 1.9 \u2013 2001\nIntegrated Planning for Sustainable Water Management 34.6 \u2013 2003\nWater Management Improvement e 20.0 \u2013 2005\nUnited Kingdom Integrated Coastal Zone Management Program 1.9 \u2013 2001\nWorld Bank Riverbank Protection \u2013 121.9 1996\nCoastal Embankment Rehabilitation \u2013 53.0 1996\nGorai River Restoration \u2013 3.0 1998\nCoastal Embankments (supplementary) \u2013 16.5 1999\nRiverbank Protection (supplementary) \u2013 45.0 1999\nWater Management Improvement e \u2013 81.5 2005\n\u2013 = not available, ADB = Asian Development Bank, BWDB = Bangladesh Water Development Board; FCDI = flood \ncontrol, drainage and irrigation; GIS = geographic information system; MOWR = Ministry of Water Resources.\na Except for those relevant to the present Project.\nb Regional study under the flood action plan.\nc A technical assistance loan that undertook feasibility studies of seven flood control and drainage/irrigation schemes \nincluding Chenchuri Beel and Narail subprojects.

The Project includes the preparation (Figure A8) and subsequent implementation of \nintegrated  water  management  plans  (IWMPs)  in  other  flood  control  and  drainage/irrigation \n(FCD/I) schemes, based on a process approach and following the methodology adopted in the \nChenchuri Beel and Narail subprojects. Possible schemes are listed in Supplementary Appendix \nC, and will be reviewed more rigorously before selecting suitable areas for further study. The \nfollowing criteria will be used in the screening and selection process.   \n(i)  The selected schemes should not contain a significant proportion of new works and \nshould fundamentally consist of rehabilitation/upgrading of existing infrastructure and \nadditional works to address a number of internal water management problems.  \n(ii)  A scheme that requires minimal and straightforward rehabilitation and improvement \nworks, higher prospects of expanding irrigated areas, and higher economic return will \nbe given preference. In this context, schemes having problems associated with major \nriverbank erosion and/or with drainage congestion of outer channels will be avoided.  \n(iii)  The scheme\u2019s net benefited areas should not be greater than 14,000 hectares (ha). \n(iv)  As an initial economic assessment (in the absence of detailed information), the \nscheme\u2019s estimated cost should not be in excess of $400/ha of the benefited area.  \n(v)  Based on available statistics, the existing poverty level within the scheme should be \nabove the present national average figure.  \n(vi)  Beneficiaries\u2019  willingness  to  form  water  management  associations  (WMAs)  and \nassume designated operation and maintenance (O&M) responsibilities is confirmed, \nand is demonstrated by enrollment of over 70% of the beneficiaries and up-front \ncash contribution to the civil works cost equivalent to annual O&M cost (1.5% of \nstructures and 3% of earthworks for the facilities to be fully managed by the WMA). \n(vii)  Elaborate IWMP is prepared through a consultative approach stipulating specific \nprogram  and  output  targets  encompassing  WMA  institutional  development, \ninfrastructure,  agriculture  and  fishery  development,  livelihood  enhancement,  and \nscheme O&M, and arrangements for their implementation including coordination and \ndemarcation of works between the Bangladesh Water Development Board and Local \nGovernment Engineering Department.   \n(viii)  The subproject must be technically feasible, financially and economically viable with \nan economic internal rate of return of over 14%, based on the detailed economic and \nfinancial  analyses  undertaken  following  the  sample  subproject  analysis.  The \nsubproject must also be robust under sensitivity and risk analysis. \n(ix)  Works required will not cause any significant adverse environmental or social impact. \nAdequate  environmental  mitigating  measures  must  be  incorporated  into  the \nsubproject design. Following the relevant policy of the Government and the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB),  initial  environmental  examination  and  environmental \nimpact assessment as applicable will be prepared and cleared by the Government \nand ADB.  \n(x)  The  subproject  will  have  no  or  minimal  land  acquisition  and/or  involuntary \nresettlement impact. In the event that land acquisition is required, resettlement plans \nwill be prepared and implemented following the resettlement framework and sample \nresettlement plans (Appendix 16). \n ", "

Objective \n1.  Consulting  services  for  institutional  strengthening  and  project  management  support \n(ISPMS) will support the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB), Water Resources \nPlanning Organization (WARPO), and other implementing agencies to fill the critical institutional \ngaps in delivering the intended project outputs while institutionalizing the process of identifying, \nplanning, implementing, and managing water with the establishment of water management \nassociations (WMAs) from an integrated and cross-sectoral perspective. From the lessons of \nsmall-scale water resources development sector projects assisted by the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), the ISPMS consultants will have a clear exit strategy and emphasize creating, as \ntheir distinct output target, a pool of highly qualified engineering and nonengineering staff who \ncan  manage  the  process  with  progressively  reduced  external  consultancy  inputs.  Specific \nperformance targets for individual staff positions will be established and closely monitored \nduring the implementation process. At the same time the consultants will support relevant policy \nand institutional actions to provide an enabling sector environment. While the project agencies \ngenerally have technical capacities to design and construct water management structures, the \nnew mandates of the national water policy (NWP) generally call for changes in the management \nsystem and behavior of the agencies, from traditional implementer to genuine service-oriented \nfacilitators. Such changes call for long-term support. \n \nB.  Scope \n2.  The task of the ISPMS consultants include support for (i) preparing a participatory \nintegrated  water  management  plan  (IWMP)  of  further  selected  flood  control,  drainage  and \nirrigation (FCD/I) schemes; (ii) strengthening WMAs and joint management committees (JMCs) \nas  viable  institutions  to  sustain  and  enhance  project  benefits;  (iii)  operating  an  integrated \napproach of water management to meet diverse stakeholder concerns; (iv) coordinating the \ndelivery  of  structures  and  services  responding  to  specific  local  needs;  (v)  developing  and \nregularly improving procedures and arrangements for a scheme management cycle from IWMP \nformulation  to  sustainable  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M);  (vi)  devising  and  operating \neffective management systems for monitoring and quality control of the process and outputs; \n(vii) identifying and advising on specific policy, institutional, legal and regulatory actions required \nby the concerned agencies to operate the above functions (Appendix 5); (viii) strengthening the \ncapacity of BWDB, WARPO, and other implementing agencies to meet their new roles with on-\nthe-job support; and (ix) providing project management support with monitoring and quality \ncontrol. Activities will be closely coordinated with the policy and institutional support provided \nthrough the Water Management Improvement Project (WMIP) assisted by the World Bank and \nthe  Government  of  the  Netherlands  and  the  twinning  missions  supported  by  the  latter \nGovernment, among other programs. \n \n3.  Over  the  7-year  project  implementation  period,  the  ISPMS  consulting  services  are \nestimated  to  total  72  person-months  of  international  and  532  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services, costing about of $4.0 million comprising $0.7 million for preparing the \nIWMPs and $3.3 million for capacity strengthening and management of their implementation.  \n \n4.  ISPMS consultants will be engaged through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic \nconsultants  through  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  procedures.

Objective  \n \n1.  The objective of the analysis is to assess the two representative subprojects (Chenchuri \nBeel and Narail subprojects,1 covering about 57,000 hectares [ha]), in terms of (i) economic \nviability, and (ii) financial impacts on farmer incomes and affordability/sustainability of operation \nand  maintenance  (O&M).  While  both  schemes  have  a  marketable  surplus  of  most  crops, \nproductivity is low compared with their potentials due to the degraded main infrastructures and \nlack of minor control facilities to address localized water management problems. In the analysis, \nbeneficial  impacts  of  improved  flood  control  and  drainage/irrigation  (FCD/I)  works  and \nnonengineering  support  (including  that  for  agriculture  and  fishery  extension  and  capacity \nstrengthening) are weighed against the capital and O&M costs. Infrastructure improvements \ninclude work on embankments, regulators and other water control structures, reexcavation of \nsilted canals, and upgrading of embankment roads. This analysis can be seen as representative \nfor the remaining subprojects, or 43,000 ha of FCD/I areas to be selected during the project \nimplementation period.  \n \nB.  Approach and Major Assumptions \n \n2.  To determine the expected direct benefits of the subprojects in question, quantifiable \neffects are valued by comparing \u201cpresent\u201d, \u201cfuture without project\u201d and \u201cfuture with project\u201d \nscenarios.2 The input-output coefficient of farm production, including cropping patterns, crop \nyields, fertilizer usage, and labor costs, was estimated based on data from the Department of \nAgriculture Extension and farm-level surveys during the project preparatory stage, and cross- \nchecked with data reported in similar projects in Bangladesh. The subprojects analyzed were \nassumed to have an economic life of 30 years, and to achieve the full benefits in the third year \nafter completion. The analysis uses a world price numeraire, and economic prices for traded \ninputs and commodities (rice, wheat, sugarcane, jute, and fertilizer) were based on the World \nBank Commodity Price Projections. The prices of other crops and farm inputs were based on \nmarket prices in the subproject areas in August 2004. A standard conversion factor of 0.90, and \na shadow wage rate of 0.85 for agriculture labor and 0.84 for construction labor were used.  \n \nC.  Estimated Costs and Benefits \n \n3.  Costs. The investment costs were estimated based on the basic design data, whereas \nO&M costs were based on field data and the concerned department guidelines. Total financial \ncosts of the Chenchuri Beel and Narail subprojects amount to Tk618 million ($10.0 million) and \nTk617 million ($10.0 million), respectively, whereas annual O&M costs amount to Tk16.5 million \nin Chenchuri Beel and Tk12.4 million in Narail.  \n \n4.  Benefits \u2013 Increased Crop Production. Crop production is expected to increase as a \nresult of improved water management within the FCD/I systems, because of (i) change in \ncropping intensity and pattern in response to improved flood protection, drainage, and irrigation; \nand (ii) increased yields. At present, about 60%, 75%, and 55% of net cultivated area (NCA) in \n                                                 \n1  The two subprojects were built in the early 1980s with the support of the World Bank and the Government of the \nNetherlands, and have been functional without major damage or further external assistance. Chenchuri Beel and \nNarail subprojects cover about 25,000 hectares (ha) and 32,000 ha of gross area, respectively, and 17,900 ha and \n23,400 ha of net cultivated area, respectively.  \n2  The \u201cfuture without Project\u201d case was differentiated from \u201cpresent\u201d case in production pattern, to take into account \nthe ongoing expansion in private tubewell irrigation and related cropping pattern changes. \n ", "  Appendix 13  49 \nthe two subproject areas is cropped in the monsoon, winter, and spring seasons, respectively. \nPaddy is most dominant across the year, yet some 30% of cultivated land is cropped with \nnoncereals during the dry season. The Project will reduce the monsoon flood risk, inducing \nfarmers  to  intensify  paddy  production  from  broadcast  to  transplanted  high  yielding  variety \nanticipated in about 10% of NCA where the broadcast variety is currently planted). Improved \ndrainage conditions will allow timely cultivation of winter crops, thereby increasing cropping \nintensity and diversity. Increased access to irrigation water retention with  control structures and \ncanal reexcavation will also expand cropping intensity/diversity, particularly that of high-yield \nvarieties of winter paddy (by about 10% of NCA) and some other high-value crops (by some \n1.5% from 9\u201310% of NCA without the Project). Overall, cropping intensity is anticipated to \nincrease by 15% and reach 220% compared with the without-Project condition. Crop yields are \nalso expected to increase because of more reliable flood protection and irrigation that will \ninduce farmers to increase the use of modern inputs, with extension support provided under the \nProject.3 As a result, production of food grains and that of other edible crops (except for jute and \nsugarcane) are expected to grow from 178,000 tons (t) and 112,000 t without the Project to \n218,000 t and 132,000 t, an increase of 22% and 18%, respectively.  \n5.  Reduction  in  Losses  due  to  Floods.  Flood  control  structures  (strengthening  of \nembankments and riverbank protection) will also reduce crop losses from flooding. To estimate \nvalue of the crop losses, data on the average crop damage over a 20-year period were used for \nthe without-Project situation.4 The net value of estimated annual crop loss is Tk6.1 million in \nChenchuri Beel and Tk8.0 million in Narail, whereas no loss is expected under the level of \nfloods observed during the same period under conditions with the Project. The Project will also \nreduce flood damage to public and private assets.5 The estimated annual reduction in such \ndamage is Tk1.5 million in Chenchuri Beel and Tk2.0 million in Narail subproject, respectively.   \n6.  Incremental Culture Fisheries Production. The Project will provide fishery extension \nservices to the concerned water management organizations in the subproject areas with a focus \non the poor, covering ponds (about 200 ha), canals (50\u2013100 ha), and paddy-cum-fish culture \n(200\u2013300 ha) for each subproject. Incremental benefits were estimated from local data on \nproduction and input-output coefficients, and crosschecked with those brought about in similar \nprojects.6 The  estimated  culture  fishery  annual  incremental  production  in  the  with-Project \nscenario amounts to 560 t (valued at Tk10.2 million) in Chenchuri Beel subproject and 660 t \n(valued at Tk11.6 million) in Narail subproject.  \n7.  Nonquantified Benefits. Apart from quantified benefits, the Project has a number of \nnonquantified benefits, including (i) improved planning capacities for preparing integrated water \nmanagement plans; (ii) improved water management infrastructure and  related service delivery \nmechanisms  with  transparent  and  accountable  governance;  (iii)  establishment  and \nempowerment of water management associations (WMAs); and (iv) improved management \ninformation  system  for  hydrological  data,  water  user  coordination,  and  FCD/I  scheme \n                                                 \n3  While the Project aims to achieve the high potential yield levels for the concerned crops reported in local agriculture \nresearch stations, a yield increase of modest level was assumed for aman (9%) and boro (6%) only, with other \ncrops assumed to have the same yields except for locally minor potato and winter vegetables.    \n4  It was estimated that about 50% of the crop would be lost in the affected area, with the same amount of inputs \nexcept for 25% of the labor costs (corresponding to harvesting and threshing).  \n5  Given the unavailability of data, valuation of these losses was based on an average of 25% of annual crop losses, \nwhich corresponds to the estimates made in the flood action plan studies.  \n6  No impact was assumed for capture fisheries, given the offsetting impacts of obstruction by additional structures \n(such as water retention) and increased water body associated with water retention and canal reexcavation.  \n ", "50  Appendix 13 \nperformance monitoring and planning. Benefits derived from strengthening the policy, planning, \nand institutional framework will have wider impacts at national and field levels.7  \n \nD.  Assessment of Economic Returns \n \n8.  Results of the economic analysis (Table A13) show that the economic internal rate of \nreturn (EIRR) is 16.5% for Chenchuri Beel and 21.2% for Narail, and the net present value at a \ndiscount rate of 12% is Tk151 million and Tk295 million, respectively. Switching values were \nestimated for certain risks including benefit decrease, cost increase, decreases in crop prices, \nlife of the project, and delayed benefits. Overall, neither subproject is strongly susceptible to \nmost of the risks examined. Reduction of the project life to 12.5 years in Chenchuri Beel and 11 \nyears in Narail  would still yield an EIRR of above 12%. For Chenchuri Beel, however, a fall in \nfood grain prices could threaten economic viability. The economic returns are expected to be \nrobust.   \nE.  Assessment of Financial Returns \n \n9.  Household Returns. Farm budget analysis was conducted for typical farm households \nin the two subproject areas. Table A13 summarizes the gains in farm net income as a result of \nthe Project, including the farmer\u2019s share of the financial contribution to the Project, i.e., annual \nO&M costs. In Chenchuri Beel and Narail subprojects, there are about 39,800 and 45,600 \nhouseholds, among which 62% and 56% are functionally landless (owning less than 0.3 ha),8 \n13% and 12% marginal (0.3\u20130.8 ha), 13% and 18% small (0.8\u20131.5 ha), 10% and 11% are \nmedium (1.5\u20133.5 ha), and 2% and 3% are large farmers (3.5 ha or more). All households \nengaged in farming and/or agriculture labor will benefit from the Project, with an average annual \nincome  increase  of  Tk4,245  for  Chenchuri  Beel  and  Tk4,400  for  Narail,  representing  an \nincrease of 18% and 16%, respectively, compared with the without-Project conditions. The \nincrease  for  functionally  landless  and  marginal  farmers  engaged  in agriculture amounts  to \nTk2,745 in Chenchuri Beel and Tk2,795 in Narail.    \n10.  Poverty  Impacts.  The socioeconomic survey done in 2004 found the poor 57% at \nChenchuri Beel and 56% at Narail, higher than the national average of 50% recorded in 2000. \nIncremental financial benefits expected to accrue to the poor were calculated to be 46% in \nChenchuri  Beel  and  43%  in  Narail,  based  on  the  estimated  present  value  of  incremental \nhousehold income items (crops, prevented flood loss, fishery, and labor including agriculture \nand construction labor) for individual household categories and their poverty head count ratio. \nPoor people will particularly benefit from increased opportunities for family and hired on-farm \nlabor,  as  well  as  construction  labor.  Annual  on-farm  labor  opportunities  are  anticipated  to \nincrease by 1.45 million days for the two sample subprojects, of which at least 0.44 million days \nwill be hired almost totally from landless and marginal farmers, with an estimated incremental \nincome of about Tk600 per concerned household.  \n11.  The Project will also improve food security, particularly for functionally landless and \nmarginal farmers. Among functionally landless and marginal farmers, an average household \nhaving an operational size of 0.23 ha with 40% of sharecropped land will increase food crop \nproduction from the present 120\u2013150 kilograms (kg) per capita to 160\u2013190kg after the Project, \nthereby substantially meeting the annual food requirements. Once food security is addressed, \nfarmers will be ready to grow more profitable crops such as vegetables and spices.  \n                                                 \n7  Besides, benefits generated from embankment road improvement were not quantified due to data unavailability. \n8  About 20% of the total population are not engaged in farming or agriculture labor.  \n ", "  Appendix 13  51 \nF.  Sustainability \n12.  The O&M responsibility of subproject infrastructure rests with WMAs for local facilities \nhaving an impact area of less than 2,500 ha, whereas other facilities are jointly managed by the \nGovernment (Bangladesh Water Development Board [BWDB]) and the WMAs (with the latter \nresponsible only for minor repair works), following the national water policy. As part of project \npreparation, the financial sustainability of subproject O&M was analyzed. The O&M costs to be \nborne by the WMAs and BWDB amount to Tk3.7 million and Tk12.9 million, respectively, in \nChenchuri Beel, and Tk5.3 million and Tk7.1 million, respectively, in Narail.  \n13.  WMA-Managed  Facilities. About 50 WMAs  are expected to be formed in the two \nsubproject areas, following the cooperatives legal framework. These WMAs need to generate \nnecessary funds to cover the O&M costs of the delegated facilities along with administrative \ncosts  to  play  its  water  management  functions.  The  annual  O&M  financial  requirement \ncorresponds to Tk205/ha in Chenchuri Beel and Tk224 in Narail, or 4\u20138% and 3\u20137% of the \nincremental income brought about by the Project among different farmer categories, with the \nlarger farmers bearing more (due to smaller per ha incremental income). While the WMAs may \nrequire a nominal administrative cost that could increase the farmer contribution (by 10\u201315%), \nthe required amount is deemed affordable to the concerned farmers, and is well within the range \npracticed  in  an  Asian  Development  Bank-assisted  project  to  support  small-scale  FCD/I \nschemes.9 The same project experience indicates that due motivational efforts and time are \nneeded to encourage WMAs to undertake sufficient O&M. To support a smooth transition, the \nProject  will  establish  O&M  reserve  fund  through  up-front  beneficiary  contribution  of  fees \nequivalent to the annual O&M requirement. This will be enhanced through further collection \nduring implementation, and WMAs will be trained to establish a practice of sufficient O&M with \ndue fund replenishment.10  \n14.  Government-Managed Facilities. BWDB does not have any revenue generated in the \ntwo subproject areas;11 thus, the total required amount of Tk20.0 million has to be borne mostly \nthrough the Government budget. While the nationwide allocation of BWDB\u2019s repair budget \nremains about half of the total requirement, the Government has been significantly increasing \nthe  maintenance  budget  allocation  to  BWDB  by  some  15%  each  year  since  FY2004,  in \nrecognition of the need for full maintenance funding and of recent BWDB reforms such as staff \nrationalization (by over 50%), initiatives of infrastructure management transfer to WMAs, and for \nincreasing  irrigation  O&M  cost  recovery.12 To  further  support  sustainable  O&M  of  BWDB \ninfrastructure, the Project will support, in conjunction with other externally assisted projects, the \nestablishment  and  nationwide  operation  of  a  management  information  system  for  O&M \nperformance monitoring and planning, covering all BWDB-managed FCD/I schemes. On the \nbasis of this, BWDB will introduce performance-based O&M budget management, under which \nthe  maintenance  fund  allocation  is  prioritized  to  schemes  having  better  performance,  in \nparticular the performance of local WMAs in terms of sustaining the O&M of WMA-managed \nfacilities and cost recovery of irrigation operations. These measures are expected to lead to duly \nimproved O&M performance of BWDB-managed facilities, particularly those where effective \nWMAs are established and operated under the Project and similar externally assisted projects.  \n                                                 \n9  Footnote 7 in the main text.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a National Priority in  Yes  Sector identified as a National Priority  Yes \nCountry Poverty Analysis?    in Country Poverty Partnership \nAgreement?   \nBangladesh remains one of the poorest countries in the world with an annual per capita income of $389 (in 2003), poverty \nincidence of 50% (in 2000), and child malnutrition rate of 48% (in 2001). Poverty is predominantly a rural phenomenon, as \nmore than 85% of the poor live in rural areas. Given that over 85% of the poor live in rural areas and engage in agriculture and \nrelated nonfarm activities, enhancing agricultural and rural development is a key to reduce poverty in the country. For the rural \npoor, access to and control of water are fundamental importance as water is the foundation for many livelihood activities, \nincluding agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and water supply. \n \nLocated at the confluence of three major river systems that bring about massive monsoon floods (that inundate some 30% of \nthe land on average), drainage congestion, riverbank erosion, dry season water scarcity, natural disasters such as cyclones, \nand widespread groundwater arsenic contamination (that is affecting some 30-50% of the population), access to water and \ntheir effective management are fundamental for the livelihood of the rural population. In Bangladesh this challenge is further \ncomplicated by diverse and complex stakeholder interests, including agriculture (interests varying in different elevations), \nfisheries, boat transport, industries, and drinking water. Water is also vital for the country\u2019s rich natural biodiversity and \necosystems. Thus, it is paramount for the country to manage water resources through an integrated, participatory, and \ndecentralized approach with due attention to water security for the poor. Improving water resource management has been \ngiven high priority in the poverty partnership agreement between the Government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \nThe national water policy and the draft national strategy for accelerated poverty reduction, or poverty reduction strategy paper \n(PRSP) emphasize programs related to water sector development. Flood management, irrigation, drainage control, erosion \nprotection, land reclamation, integrated management of coastal polders, river flow augmentation, sharing of water from \ntransboundary rivers, and wet land conservation through the participation of stakeholders are considered important not only for \nhuman beings but also for agriculture, fisheries, and biodiversity. The PRSP has flagged the interface between water and \npoverty so that required intervention is designed properly. \n \nThe Project will contribute to increased agricultural production, improve food security, and address the viability of poor rural \npeople  through  effective  water  management.  The  rehabilitation  of  the  flood  control  and  drainage/irrigation  (FCD/I) \ninfrastructure, including embankments, regulators and retention structure, sluices, canal reexcavation and riverbank protection, \nwill expand the irrigated area, and improve crop yields and fisheries production. The Project will contribute to improving the \nrural economy by enhancing agricultural production, fisheries development, social forestry and income-generating activities. \nThe Project will help increase the household income of the landless and poor women. Furthermore, providing safe water supply \nto safeguard the people in the project area from arsenic poisoning will improve living conditions of the population with respect \nto health. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nOverall Status and Causes  \nTo assess the expected socioeconomic impact of the Project socioeconomic analysis was carried out in two sample subproject \nareas, where over 85,400 households (0.4 million people) live. The majority of the farmers in the subproject areas are landless \npeople and marginal farmers (68-75%), followed by small farmers (13-18%), and medium-sized (10-11%) and large (2-3%) \nholdings. Poverty incidence is 56-57%. Landless and marginal farmers live below the extreme poverty line and the majority of \nsmallholders fall below the moderate poverty line. Poverty in the subproject areas is reflected in low standards of living, poor \nhealth, lack of education, abandonment of women and children, and vulnerability of most households to floods. The basic \ncauses of poverty are lack of access to productive resources (mainly water and land), to public resources such as health \nprovisions, education, and transport and employment. The lack of social protection measures, participatory governance, \nentrepreneurship, and alternative livelihood opportunities makes marginal farmers, the landless, and women particularly \nvulnerable.  \n \nThe main problems in the two subproject areas, as represented by the landless and marginal farmers, are shortage of land and \nincome opportunities. The community expectations of the benefits and impacts of the Project are (i) increased agriculture and \nfish production, (ii) more opportunities for disadvantaged groups to become involved in farming and nonfarming activities, and \n(iii) increased income opportunities. All women interviewed expected to benefit from the Project mainly by employment and \nincome generation through improved postharvest work, livestock and fish production, farm and homestead production, cottage \nindustries, improved water supply and sanitation services, and access to credit.   \n \nAdditional data is required during implementation to identify specific needs and interests of the poor so that appropriate support \ncould be designed in terms of access to resources including skills, finance, and organizations.  \n \n ", "54  Appendix 14 \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder Analysis  Prepared: Yes  \nA participatory process was used during the project preparatory stage and discussions were carried out with women, \nfishermen, the landless, and other vulnerable groups in the two subproject areas using participatory rapid rural appraisal \n(PRRA) techniques. An inventory of local needs was prepared, encompassing problems/constraints related to (i) water \nresources in relation to domestic agriculture, fisheries, transport, environment, and other uses; (ii) possible solutions to resolve \nthe constraints identified including their positive and negative impact on various local interest groups; (iii) implications of \nsolutions for poverty reduction; and (iv) prioritizing water resources needs compared with other development needs. The role of \nservice providers, people\u2019s willingness to contribute to operations and maintenance (O&M), and the scope of enhancing \nimpacts of water interventions with others such as microcredit, and extension services were also discussed. Nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) were engaged to facilitate this process. The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) identified \nthe future course of action and mechanisms to institutionalize community participation in the expected implementation areas. \n \nAgricultural benefits constitute the largest part of the total project benefits and are likely to accrue mainly to landowners. \nHowever, the project design ensures that the poor, including the landless, marginal farmers, and women, at least share equally \nin the distribution of the income growth benefit from the Project through increased agricultural production and employment \nopportunities.  \n \nThe poor will benefit from shared cropping and labor income as the land area will increase and the poor will be hired on a wage \nbasis to cover the increased labor needs of medium-sized and large landholders. In addition, labor for earthworks and other \nproject-related construction and maintenance work will be drawn from poor households, with preference for destitute women.  \n \nParticipatory Social Development Strategy Prepared:  Yes \nThe Project will continue to be driven by the needs and demands of the communities that recognize the importance of water \nresource management to protect and improve their livelihood activities. The Project will ensure a social development strategy \nthat  (i)  allocates  sufficient  time  and  resources  to  establish  viable  local  organizations  particularly  water  management \nassociations (WMAs); (ii) provides a legal status for these organizations; (iii) promotes partnership among Government \nagencies, local government, and civil society groups; and (iv) defines and puts into place a process and procedures to ensure \nmeaningful beneficiary participation in all stages of the Project. \n \nThe social development strategy will include the following:  procedures and guidelines for selecting beneficiaries for WMA \nmembership, employment, credit access; participation of  WMAs in designing, planning, implementing and monitoring the sub-\nproject activities and drafting the WMA by-laws; a comprehensive capacity-building plan highlighting training for project staff, \nWMAs, and village groups; guidelines and procedures for social activities such as poverty reduction, conflict resolution, anti-\ndowry drives, women repression and voting rights; procedures for networking and linkages among WMAs and service-providing \nagencies; and regular project-level coordination meetings with representatives of project staff, NGOs, and WMA members.  \n \nThe strategy will also establish consultative platforms at the village level in conjunction with the district administration, local \ngovernment institution, and NGOs before appropriate interventions are designed for water infrastructure improvement, farming \nand  nonfarming  production,  and  income  generation.  NGOs  will  provide  leadership  and  confidence-building  training  for \norganizational and capacity building among the poor and women\u2019s groups in preparation for developing independent WMAs \ncapable of managing and operating their FCD schemes. Furthermore, village facilitators will be selected and trained to provide \na  sustainable  mechanism  for  continued  community-based  management  and  development.  The  Project  will  establish \nprocedures for close coordination among district administration and NGOs for effective service delivery.   \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \nWomen in Bangladesh remain particularly vulnerable to living in poverty. Socially prescribed roles have limited women\u2019s \naccess to economic resources such as capital, skill and marketing know-how. These same social norms limit women\u2019s \nparticipation in political and other forms of decision making that affect their lives. The restrictions are particularly hard to \novercome for women who head households, whether as widows or through divorce or abandonment. Women workers earn \nconsiderably less than male workers and there is persistent lower average calorie consumption for females, indicated by higher \nsevere malnutrition, mortality, and morbidity rates for girls and women than for males. There is, however, no analysis of \nhousehold economy that provides the link between the gender gaps identified and their causes. Differences in poverty levels \nbetween households headed by males and females highlight the difficulties women face in benefiting from economic growth. \nThe average monthly income of female headed households in rural areas is approximately 35% lower than that of male headed \nhouseholds and is 33% less than in urban areas.1 This corroborates assumptions that female headed families have difficulties \naccessing both the assets required for adequate income and benefiting from services, or other programs that generally target \nmale household heads. \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2004.

Manila.  \n ", "  Appendix 14  55 \nWomen are important producers of homestead crops and livestock, and their postharvest activities contribute over 50% of the \nvalue of crop produce (footnote 1). The division of labor is prescribed by social norms that by tradition limit women to remaining \nin seclusion in the immediate household area. Women therefore do not take produce to market or interact in public with men. \nThese restrictions on women\u2019s mobility also limit their capacity to control the proceeds from their labor or to access extension \nservices, especially when male officers deliver services. Women also have little or no access to land other than through their \nrelationship with male family members. \n \nA gender action plan (GAP) has been developed to ensure that gender concerns are addressed and dealt with in the most \neffective and efficient manner. The Project will give specific attention to employment of female staff at all levels and train field \nstaff in gender-sensitive and participatory planning and project implementation. Furthermore the GAP will ensure employment \nopportunities generated by the Project and O&M works; train women to be involved in WMAs and all aspects of O&M; support \nwomen's work in farm and homestead production; strengthen the extension system to be gender-equitable to ensure its \neffectiveness; identify and respond to women's agricultural and household needs for technology in close collaboration with \nimplementing agencies and NGOs; support women in their home-based postharvest production and marketing activities by \nproviding local market information and linkages, improving transportation and storage facilities, improving processing and \npackaging techniques, enhancing credit facilities; provide women with training in crop and horticulture production, postharvest \noperations, poultry and small livestock rearing, social forestry; and fisheries production and processing, credit, seed production, \nnutrition education; and identify gender-specific monitoring indicators. One gender specialist will be posted in the project \nmanagement office to further develop and implement the GAP for the Project, and to supervise four social development and \ngender specialists engaged through NGOs who will be posted at each subproject management office to implement and monitor \nthe GAP. \n \nGender Action Prepared: Yes \nRefer to the GAP in Appendix 15. \n \nE.

Summary Resettlement Framework \n \n1.  Scope and Impacts. The resettlement framework (RF) outlines the policy, procedures, \nand institutional requirements for preparing and implementing resettlement plans (RPs) for the \ntwo sample subprojects as well as for future subprojects selected under the Southwest Area \nIntegrated  Water  Resources  Planning  and  Management  Project.  The  Project  includes \nrehabilitation  and  improvement  of  existing  flood  control  and  drainage/irrigation  (FCD/I) \ninfrastructure, and involves resectioning, widening, and new construction of flood embankments; \nplacement of revetment along eroding riverbanks; reexcavation of canals; and installment of \nwater control structures including regulators, inlet/outlet pipes or sluices under embankments, \nand check structures within canals, for which the concerned land strips would need to be \nacquired by the Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB).  \n \n2.    Resettlement Policy. Resettlement will be implemented in accordance with the policy \non  involuntary  resettlement  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  following  the \nGovernment\u2019s Acquisition and Requisition of Immovable Property (ARIP) Ordinance 1982 and \nEast Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act (1951, revised 1998).  \n \n3.  Resettlement  Principles,  Entitlements,  and  Procedures.  The  RF  applies  to  all \ninvoluntary resettlement effects\u2013including displacement of nontitled people\u2013arising from land \nacquisition or conversion, or any other effects that arise from the project works, including the \neffects on people with no title to the land.

Institutional  Responsibilities  and  Procedures.  The  project  management  office \n(PMO)\u2013under the responsibility of the chief resettlement and environmental manager with the \nrank of senior executive engineer, and guidance of the project director\u2013has overall planning, \nfinancing, and supervisory responsibility for preparing and implementing the RPs, with the \nsupport of the consultants, including capacity strengthening and monitoring. The specific works \nwill  be  carried  out  by  the  subproject  management  offices  (SMOs)  through  a  resettlement \ncoordinator with the rank of executive engineer or senior subdivisional engineer. The PMO will \nengage  experienced  non-government  organizations  (NGOs)  to  assist  the  process  with  the \nsupport of the consultants. For future subprojects, the concerned SMO will undertake social \nimpact assessment with the consultants based on preliminary technical designs, and prepare \nfull or short RPs in compliance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement and other social \nsafeguard guidelines. The full and short RPs will be reviewed by BWDB and submitted to ADB \nfor approval. For all subprojects, RPs will be further developed upon completion of the detailed \ndesign, and must also be submitted to ADB for approval. APs should be fully compensated \nbefore award of the relevant civil works contracts. BWDB will ensure that resettlement budgets \nare delivered on time to the deputy commissioner\u2019s office and the implementing NGOs.   \n \n5.  Disclosure,  Consultation,  and  Grievances.  Each  RP  will  be  prepared  and \nimplemented  in  close  consultation  with  the  stakeholders  and  will  involve  focus  group \ndiscussions and meetings with the APs, with disclosure of resettlement information in the form \nof brochures written in the local language. Copies of the RF and draft RPs will be distributed \namong NGOs and community groups prior to finalizing the engineering design. The two sample \nsubproject RPs, updated based on detailed technical design and future subproject RPs, will be \ndistributed  to  APs,  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website,  and  submitted  to  ADB  for  approval.  A \ngrievance redress committee (GRC) will be established with representatives from the SMO, \nAPs, and local government institutions (LGIs) through official gazette. The GRC will resolve AP \ngrievances with non-legal complications. People\u2019s participation will also be ensured through a \nresettlement advisory committee established at the local level involving local leaders including \nmen and women.  \n \n6.  Monitoring and Evaluation. BWDB, with assistance from the resettlement specialist, \nwill establish a monthly monitoring system involving PMO, SMOs, and implementing NGOs, and \nprepare progress reports on all aspects of land acquisition and resettlement (covering staff \nappointment  and  capacities,  planning,  scheduling  and  budgeting;  delivery  of  entitlements \nincluding  income  restoration  activities;  consultation,  grievance,  and  other  issues;  and \nresettlement impacts) in the quarterly reports, including identification of significant issues. An \nannual report stipulating all efforts and outcome will be submitted to ADB. External monitoring \nwill also be assigned to an independent domestic expert, who will review the progress and \nperformance  of  RP  preparation  and  implementation  and  report  the  findings  and \nrecommendations simultaneously to BWDB and ADB.  \n \n7.  Resettlement Cost. The cost of land acquisition and resettlement is estimated at Tk204 \nmillion ($3.4 million) including NGO services. The Government will provide the entire fund for \nland acquisition and resettlement, and will guarantee meeting unforeseen obligations in excess \nof the budget estimate to meet the resettlement objectives.  \n   \nB.  Summary Resettlement Plans \n \n8.  Scope  and  Impact.  Table  16.2  shows  the  scope  and  resettlement  impacts  of  the \nrehabilitation and improvement of two sample FCD/I schemes. \n ", "60  Appendix 16 \nTable A16.2.

Socioeconomic Status of Affected Persons. According to the stated income, 17% and \n45% of the households affected in their homestead, shops, ponds, and shrimp ghers have \nincome below the poverty line in Chenchuri Beel and Narail subproject, respectively, with nine \nand seven households headed by women, respectively. Among the persons losing agriculture \nland, 19% fall below the poverty line in both subprojects, with 9 and 11 tenant farmers in \nChenchuri Beel and Narail subproject, respectively.   \n \n10.  Stakeholder Consultation and Entitlements. During the project preparatory stage, the \nGovernment, with the assistance of the consultants undertook consultation using participatory \nrural appraisal and focus group discussions, distributed copies of a local language brochure and \nfollowed  the  entitlement  matrix  shown  in  Table  A16.1.  After  the  consultation,  appropriate \nmitigating measures and compensation packages were devised, following the RF. The RP as \nprepared will be refined further at the time of detailed design, submitted to ADB for approval, \nwith full disclosure to APs and on the ADB website. The Project will encourage \u201cself-relocation\u201d \nby affected households, selecting replacement homestead land in the vicinity of their own. \nAdditional measures will be taken to provide appropriate support to the livelihood restoration \naspects  of  the  project-affected  people,  with  a  focus  on  poor  and  vulnerable  households,  \nparticularly those with female heads, with priority participation in the livelihood enhancement \ncomponent of the Project, and targeted provision of employment for civil works and other \nopportunities created under the Project. \n \n11.  Implementation Responsibilities and Cost Estimates. The arrangement described in \nthe RF is followed, including the implementation arrangements (engagement of local NGOs with \nsupervision and support with the assistance of the consultants); disclosure, consultation, and \ngrievance mechanisms, and monitoring and evaluation. The estimated cost for acquisition of \nland and assets, and the cost associated with involuntary resettlement are Tk25.2 million ($0.43 \nmillion) for Chenchuri Beel and Tk86.0 million ($1.47 million) for Narail. The Government will \nprovide the entire fund for land acquisition and resettlement. The APs will receive compensation \nprior to award of civil works contracts.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20051125123725+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20051102163731+08'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R293-05.doc", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "AJ3", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0 (Windows)"}}
