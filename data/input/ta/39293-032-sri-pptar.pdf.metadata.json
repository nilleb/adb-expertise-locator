The education sector has always played an important role in Sri Lanka with both parents \nand Government alike emphasizing the need to obtain a high quality education as a priority for \nall youth. Whilst there has been success in achieving strong primary education enrolment and \nhigh literacy levels, this foundation must now be harnessed and converted to an asset for the \nfuture. The end of the civil conflict and the anticipated rapid economic growth has made this a \nmore urgent and necessary condition. In particular, the improvement of survival rates through \nsecondary education and the increase in relevance of the knowledge and skills to meet the \nrequirements  of  the  private  sector.  The  Government\u2019s  Education  Sector  Development \nFramework and Plan (ESDFP) 2012-2016 envisages a wide-ranging set of initiatives to address \nthese challenges. The technical assistance (TA) will assess existing challenges and develop a \nproject that is anchored in the Government\u2019s ESDFP and is suitable for ADB financing in all \ndimensions: technical, financial/economic, institutional, sector policy, and safeguards; aligned \nwith the new country partnership strategy and built on lessons learned from the previous ADB \ninvestments in the education sector in Sri Lanka. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n \n2.  The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will deliver a number of outputs: (i) \nidentification of priority activities for ADB support under the Multitranche Financing Facility \n(MFF), as well as specific results indicators against which disbursement would be made; (ii) \nvalidation of the school mapping process to select schools for the 1,000 school program in the \nprovinces that will receive ADB support; (iii) technical assessment that includes the design for \nthe proposed revisions to the school based assessment (SBA) system including a detailed \nprocess  mapping  of  the  existing  system  for  collecting  and  reporting  SBA  test  scores;  (iv) \ncapacity assessment including a review of the provincial education system, that includes the \ndesign and implementation plan for the revision of the Education Management Information \nSystem (EMIS) and detail options for introducing more regular, relevant and timely reporting to \nsupport  decision  making;  and  program  for  strengthening  of  the  zonal  offices  in  providing \nclassroom-based  training  support  to  teachers;  (v)  design  options  for  provision  of  school \ndevelopment  grants  that  encourage  autonomy  and  sustainability  at  the  school  level;  (vi) \ngovernance assessment and action plan, integrating the fiduciary assessment and capacity \nassessment  of  the  education  system;  (vii)  design  options  for  the  project\u2019s  financing  and \ndisbursement mechanisms to provide financing against meeting of results indicators to the \nGovernment\u2019s own program.  \n \n3.  The  PPTA  will  also  prepare  the  facility  administration  manual  to  guide  overall \nimplementation of the proposed Education Sector Development Program (ESDP) MFF, and the \ndetailed first tranche design.  An economic and financial analysis will be carried out; as well as a \nfiduciary risk assessment.
