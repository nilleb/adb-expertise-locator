INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Government of \nKazakhstan and the Ministry of Finance (MOF) State Borrowing Department (SBD) in improving \npublic  debt  management  and  developing  the  government  securities  market.  The  TA  will \n(i) develop a debt management strategy for optimizing debt risks, costs, and coverage of public \nsector debt; (ii) prepare an action plan to develop the government securities market, including \nexpanding the domestic and international investor base; and (iii) prepare a plan to improve \ngovernment agency coordination for cash and debt management. The TA will also strengthen \nMOF capacity for issuing and managing government debt, and identify further reforms for \ninclusion  in  a  potential  subsequent  policy-based  loan.1 The  TA  is  included  in  the  country \noperations business plan, 2019\u20132021 and is consistent with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \ncountry partnership strategy for Kazakhstan, 2017\u20132021.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Countercyclical fiscal policy response to economic crises. Gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth decelerated to 1.2% (2015) and 1.1% (2016) following a decline in oil prices and \nrecession in the Russian Federation.3 Significant budget expenditure increases from stimulus \npackages and a slowdown in revenue caused rapid increases in the overall fiscal deficit, reaching \n6.3% in 2015 and 5.4% in 2016.4 The non-oil fiscal deficit5 expanded from 8.3% of GDP in 2013 \nto 10.0% in 2016 and 12.6% of GDP in 2017.6 The GDP growth rate rose to 4.1% in 2017 as oil \nprices continue to recover and the pass-through benefits of government stimulus spending are \nrealized. However, economic recovery is still fragile as growth is forecast to lower to 3.7% in 2018 \nand 3.9% in 2019.7 In 2018 the government has moved toward fiscal consolidation following the \nlarge stimulus packages, and public expenditure is projected to reduce to relatively low levels of \n19% of GDP for 2018 and 2019.8 \n \n3.  Public  borrowing  to  finance  macroeconomic  stimulus.  The  government  issued \nsovereign bonds (eurobonds) of $6.5 billion in 2014 and 2015, and increased borrowing from \ninternational  financial  institutions  ($7  billion  outstanding  in  2018).  Direct  expenditures  and \ntransfers from the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan (NFRK) to the budget also \nsignificantly increased. As of January 2018, government debt was 19.6% of GDP (Table 1) and \ntotal public sector debt, including state-owned enterprise (SOE) debt, was 53.6% of GDP. The \nproportion of public sector debt that is external has increased to 47.2%. Government debt, \nexcluding National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) debt, is expected to remain stable at 20% of GDP \nin 2018 (footnote 6). New regulations will reduce guaranteed transfers from NFRK to the budget, \nto be fixed at T2 trillion ($6.1 billion) from 2020, and off-budget lending from NFRK to SOEs has \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the website of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on \n3 October 2018. \n2  ADB. 2017.

Lack of public debt strategy. A debt strategy is important to ensure that government \nfinancing needs for the budget are met, while minimizing debt service costs and reducing fiscal \nrisk exposure and vulnerability to economic shocks.10 Debt servicing costs are projected to \nexceed the government\u2019s threshold of 15% of gross annual revenue by 2022. Fiscal risks are not \nsuitably addressed in the debt portfolio, including market risks (i.e., impact of exchange rate \nfluctuations on foreign currency debt), refinancing risks, interest rate risks (45% of outstanding \ndebt has interest rates adjusted within 1 year), and the realization of contingent liabilities. \nSignificant  currency  depreciation  since  the  floating  of  the  tenge  in  2015  has  highlighted \nKazakhstan\u2019s exposure to foreign currency debt and the need to improve debt management \ncapacity.11 \n \n5.  State-owned enterprise borrowing. The three main SOE holding companies\u2014Samruk-\nKazyna, Baiterek, and Kaz-agro\u2014are able to raise debt on international markets. SOE debt \nreached 26.9% of GDP in January 2018, of which 58.5% is external debt (Table 1). Although \noutstanding government debt to GDP is modest by international standards, fiscal risks from SOEs \nare  significant  and may  increase further,  based  on  a  planned gasification  project  and the \ngovernment\u2019s plans to build a fourth oil refinery (footnote 6). Fiscal risks from SOE debt are not \ncurrently addressed as part of a comprehensive public debt management plan. The potential debt \nburden from realizing the government\u2019s contingent liabilities (including guaranteed debts of SOEs \nand other implicit contingent liabilities) are also not taken into account.12 The Ministry of National \nEconomy has developed new legislation for limiting external debt accumulation by key SOE \nholding companies. \n \n6.  Government  securities  market  undeveloped.  The  investor  base  for  domestic \ngovernment debt is concentrated, with 45% of domestic debt owned by the unified pension fund \nas of April 2018 and 34% of domestic debt held by commercial banks. For external government \n                                                \n9  Presidential Decree 825 of 8 December 2016. \n10 International  Monetary  Fund  and  World  Bank.  2009.  Managing  Public  Debt:  Formulating  Strategies  and \nStrengthening Institutional Capacity. Washington, DC. \n11 The World Bank Joint Economic Research Program prepared policy notes for the government related to debt \nmanagement, government securities analysis, and SOE debt. \n12 If they occur, contingent liabilities will increase the government\u2019s total liabilities or debt, including explicit contingent \nliabilities (i.e., with a contract such as government guarantees or deposit insurance) and implicit contingent liabilities \ni.e., an expected but not formal obligation, such as bank bailouts and financial support to SOEs in case of default). \n ", "3 \ndebt, 47% comprises eurobonds and 51% is from international financial institutions.13 MOF issues \nmostly medium- and long-term bonds with an average maturity of 8.7 years. MOF Treasury bills \n(short-term debt) are undeveloped. The absence of a government yield curve creates difficulty for \naccurate pricing. Auctions for government securities are often unpredictable, arranged at short \nnotice, and sometimes cancelled (e.g., 6 out of 17 auctions cancelled in 2015). This is not \nconducive to market development where stable and predictable issuance is key. \n \n7.  Institutional  coordination  issues.  MOF  issues  government  securities  for  budget \nfinancing requirements and NBK issues notes (short-term debt) as a tool for liquidity management. \nHowever, coordination is weak, with recent large issuances of NBK notes crowding out demand \nfor MOF securities and vice versa.14 The Committee for Treasury, which is responsible for cash \nmanagement, plays a key role in deciding the securities auctions timing (together with SBD) and \ncutoff prices. As a result, domestic borrowing tends to be volatile throughout the year. Transfers \nfrom the NFRK to the budget are front loaded in the first half of the year, which affects the \nregularity of government securities issuance. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: effective fiscal policy to support economic \ngrowth.15 The TA will have the following outcome: public debt management improved.16 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n9.  Output 1: Medium-term debt strategy prepared. The TA will support SBD in developing \na comprehensive medium-term debt strategy (MTDS) and borrowing program. This will guide \nstate borrowing to meet the government\u2019s financing needs at least cost, based on the desired risk \nprofile and diversification of the debt portfolio and composition (i.e., increased share of domestic \ndebt), while ensuring compliance with the government\u2019s fiscal rules. The MTDS will cover public \nsector debt (including SOE debt) and estimate the risk to public debt from government contingent \nliabilities (including from SOEs and other sources, e.g., systemically important banks). The TA \nwill also provide training and workshops to strengthen SBD staff capacity for preparing and \nimplementing the MTDS, and identify reforms required to operationalize the MTDS and improve \ndebt management. \n \n10.  Output 2: Institutional coordination plan developed. The TA will assist to improve \ninstitutional coordination between MOF and NBK related to debt management, and coordinate \nfiscal and monetary policy objectives (i.e., finance sector liquidity management). The TA will (i) \ndevelop an agreed coordination plan (consistent with the MTDS) for scale and timing of securities \nauctions  to  avoid  conflicting  objectives;  (ii)  improve  consultation  and  dialogue  related  to \ngovernment securities development (e.g., through an MOF\u2013NBK working group); and (iii) provide \ncapacity building to enable SBD to take a lead role in domestic securities issuance and improve \ncoordination with cash management under the Committee for Treasury. \n \n11.  Output 3: Action plan for developing government securities market prepared. To \nsupport MOF and other stakeholders in developing the government securities market, the TA will \n                                                \n13 MOF SBD debt data. \n14 NBK notes issuance increased substantially from T0.4 trillion in 2015 to T5.5 trillion in 2017 (MOF). \n15 Government of Kazakhstan. 2017.

Astana. \n16 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nprepare an action plan and build capacity through training and workshops for SBD to expand and \ndiversify the investor base (including resident and nonresident investors). The action plan will \nalign with SBD\u2019s plans to relocate issuance of MOF securities from the Kazakhstan Stock \nExchange to the new Astana International Exchange (majority owned by MOF) and assess \ninfrastructure needs. The TA will support SBD in holding regular securities auctions, developing \ninvestor relations, and meeting other preconditions to encourage securities market development. \nA more developed domestic government securities market will reduce portfolio risks, increase \naccess to funds, reduce financing costs, and provide greater resilience to financial crisis. A more \nliquid government bond market will enable greater borrowing and lending options for the private \nsector and increase competition with the banking sector. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $850,000, of which $750,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2. \n \n13.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation and supplies, secretarial assistance, domestic transportation, and other in-kind \ncontributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  through  its  Central  and  West  Asia  Department,  Public \nManagement, Financial Sector and Trade Division, which will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants; organize discussions; and provide staff to act as resource persons as required. \nADB\u2019s Kazakhstan Resident Mission will provide local administrative and coordination support as \nneeded. \n \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2. \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  October 2018\u2013December 2020 \nExecuting agency  Ministry of Finance, State Borrowing Department \nImplementing agencies  ADB\u2019s Central and West Asia Department, Public Management, \nFinancial Sector and Trade Division \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual consultant  International expertise  $573,320 \nselection  (18 person-months) \nand national expertise \n(28 person-months) \nDisbursement  The technical assistance resources will be disbursed following \nADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n16.
