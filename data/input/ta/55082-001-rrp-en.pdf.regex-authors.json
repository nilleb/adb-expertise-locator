THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed loans to \nIndia for the Responsive COVID-19 Vaccines for Recovery Project under the Asia Pacific Vaccine \nAccess Facility (the project).1 The report also describes the proposed administration of a loan to \nbe provided by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) for the project, and if the Board \napproves the proposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the loan.   \n \n2.  The project will benefit significantly from an abbreviated consideration period by the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) Board of Directors since it supports the Government of India\u2019s rapid \nvaccination rollout to contain the ongoing pandemic and the severity of a possible third wave as \nwell as the loss of lives. The government has already placed orders for Asia Pacific Vaccine \nAccess Facility (APVAX)-eligible vaccines and incurred substantial costs from the accelerated \npace of vaccination since August 2021.2 Timely ADB support would add value by helping meet \nurgent financing needs for delivering APVAX-eligible vaccines for priority population, and allow \ngovernment resources to procure the planned non-APVAX eligible vaccines.3 Vaccine financing \nwould also safeguard essential expenditure on emergency response needs, strengthen the \nresilience of health systems, and contribute to the country\u2019s commitment to an earlier resumption \nof vaccine export.  \n \n3.  The project will provide the government with timely financing to procure safe and effective \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines based on an agreed list of eligible expenditures under \nthe rapid response component (RRC) of the APVAX. Ongoing technical assistance (TA) will \ncomplement the project by strengthening the vaccine delivery system.4  \n \n4.  The project is aligned with four of the operational priorities of ADB's Strategy 2030: \n(i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in gender \nequality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing \nenvironmental  sustainability;  and  (iv)  fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  It  is \nconsistent  with  ADB's  country  partnership  strategy,  2018\u20132022  for  India,  which  prioritizes \nimprovements in quality health care delivery and gender equality.5 \n \n5.  India has met all APVAX access criteria by (i) demonstrating the adverse impact of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic; (ii) completing a needs assessment, including a vaccination allocation and \nprioritization plan and an incremental medical waste management plan, acceptable to ADB; \n(iii) providing a governor's letter confirming the government's commitment to implement the plans \nand ensuring compliance with revised APVAX eligibility criteria for ADB financing;6 and (iv) setting \nup an effective development partner coordination mechanism with a clear role for ADB.  \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2020.

Unemployment \nincreased to 20.9% in April\u2013June 2020, from 9.1% in the previous quarter.c The impact on \nwomen has been severe because more women lost jobs than men, and women also faced \na greater burden of family care and domestic violence. \nNeeds assessment  A needs assessment using WHO\u2019s vaccine introduction readiness assessment tool \ncompleted   highlighted India\u2019s high level of readiness for COVID-19 vaccination. d In addition, the \n  government developed detailed COVID-19 vaccine operational guidelines and a \ncomprehensive communication strategy for COVID-19 vaccine deployment to guide the \nnational vaccination program. ADB due diligence identified the need for further \nstrengthening in BMWM, risk communication and community engagement, private sector \nengagement, and monitoring and evaluation systems.  \nNational vaccination  The National Deployment and Vaccination Plan, approved on 12 January 2021, prioritizes \nallocation plan  health care workers, other essential frontline workers, and older people\u2014in line with the \nWHO SAGE framework. e The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for \nCOVID-19 and the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization provide guidance \nfor priority population groups based on emerging epidemiological evidence and global best \npractices. The government adopted a dynamic mapping model considering the availability \nof vaccines and coverage of priority groups. \nIncremental BMWM   The BMWM Rules 2016 outline the requirements for BMWM. The guidelines on BMWM \nunder the Universal Immunization Programme 2021 provide additional guidance for \nimmunization activities. Further, the CPCB issued detailed guidelines for COVID-19 \nimmunization focusing on reduction, segregation, disinfection, and transport of waste; and \ndisseminated them to states and union territories on 23 December 2020.

THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale   \n \n1.  The Pandemic \n \n ", "3 \n6.  Background. Since the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed in India on 30 January \n2020, 34,377,113 cases were confirmed and 461.389 people have died from the virus as of 10 \nNovember 2021.7 The pandemic resulted in very high costs to the country's overall health, well-\nbeing, and economy. India faced a devastating second wave starting March 2021, which peaked \nwith a record high of 414,188 new COVID-19 cases on 7 May 2021.8 This was about 32% higher \nthan the world\u2019s previous peak reported by the United States in 2020.9 The second wave in India \noverwhelmed hospitals and exhausted health workers, who were increasingly becoming infected. \nDespite the containment measures with localized lockdowns and social distancing, increased \ntesting capacity (over 2.2 million samples a day) to detect cases, and a national vaccination drive, \nthe possibility of a third wave looms large because of highly contagious variants.  \n \n7.  Equitable access to safe and effective vaccines has proven to be lifesaving and is critical \nto ending the COVID-19 pandemic. Recognizing this need, the government started rolling out \ninoculations on 16 January 2021. More than 1.09 billion vaccine doses had been administered in \nmore than 11.07 million sessions by 9 November 2021.10 India aims to inoculate 944.7 million \npeople (68.9% of its total population). Given the devastating second wave and the threat of a third \nwave, the government allocated significant financing to strengthen health systems, which further \nstrained its resource envelope.11 The government requires immediate financing to inoculate the \ntarget population and limit the impacts of the pandemic. \n \n2.  Impact of the Pandemic \n \n8.  Costs to the economy. India\u2019s economy faced its worst contraction in fiscal year (FY) \n2020 since World War II, contracting at 7.3%.12 Its gross domestic product (GDP) will remain \nbelow the pre-pandemic trend in GDP despite projected growth of 10.0% in FY2021 and 7.5% in \nFY2022.The fiscal deficit widened significantly as the government confronted the pandemic and \nbegan supporting economic and social recovery. The fiscal deficit as a share of GDP increased \nto 9.2% in FY2021 amid falling revenue and higher expenditure, from 4.6% of GDP in FY2020.13 \nThe ratio of public debt to GDP increased substantially in FY2021 and will continue to remain \nelevated in the medium term. As COVID-19 cases fell and lockdown measures eased, the \neconomy started to recover, but the looming threat of a third wave remains. Extensive and \naccelerated vaccine deployment is key to India's economic recovery. \n \n9.  Disproportionate  impact  on  the  vulnerable  and  women.  COVID-19  has  had  a \nsignificant impact on lives and livelihoods. During the first wave, unemployment as measured by \nthe weekly status increased to 20.9% between April and June 2020, from 9.1% in the previous \nquarter.14 Although the unemployment rate fell in the next two quarters, earnings for those re-\nemployed may not have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. The impact on women has been \nsevere in terms of wage inequality and the burden of unpaid care. In the informal sector, women \nfared even worse. Between March and April 2021, rural Indian women in informal jobs accounted \n \n7  Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Unemployment estimates are based on current weekly status.  \n \n ", "4 \nfor 80% of job losses.15 Women\u2019s share of unpaid care work grew by nearly 30% and India \nrecorded 2.5 times increase in domestic violence between February and May 2020.16 India\u2019s \npandemic response relies heavily on women frontline health workers, which puts them at a greater \nexposure to COVID-19 and increases vulnerability. In terms of access to vaccines, women's \ncoverage was 46.8% as of 10 August 2021, which is lower than the proportionate population of \nwomen. Therefore, more efforts are needed to ensure equitable access for women. As economic \nactivities  resume,  protecting  the  vulnerable,  including  informal  workers  and  women,  with \nvaccination should be prioritized, and access to free public vaccination is a key strategy for that.  \n \n10.  Impacts on the health system. The pandemic has enormously strained health care \ndelivery systems in India, exposing long-standing gaps and exacerbating inequities. With five \nhospital beds and nine physicians per 10,000 people,17 the country was not equipped for a crisis \nof this scale. The sudden unprecedented surge in cases during the second wave resulted in an \nacute shortage of medical oxygen\u2014and several Indian states reported a crisis.18 Response \nefforts were further constrained by the lack of adequate health care staff such as specialists, \ndoctors,  nurses,  and  paramedics.  The  supply-side  disruptions,  and  reduced  health-seeking \nbehavior for fear of contracting COVID-19 and mobility restrictions also hampered the delivery of \nessential and emergency health care services. Facility-based outpatient care declined by 33% \nand inpatient care fell by 21% compared with pre-pandemic levels.19 There was a staggering 22% \ndecline in institutional deliveries, elevating the risk of infection and maternal complications from \nunsafe childbirth methods. \n \n3.  Government Response \n \n11.  Measures introduced to control the pandemic. The government adopted the whole-of-\ngovernment approach and took proactive and preemptive measures to contain the pandemic \nsince its onset in 2020. A stringent nationwide lockdown for 21 days was declared on 24 March \n2020 and subsequently extended three times until 31 May 2020. India strengthened points of \nentry and public information and awareness campaigns, and quickly adopted digital solutions \nsuch as the Aarogya Setu application for contact tracing, hotspot mapping, and information \ndissemination. To fortify health systems, the government implemented a COVID-19 emergency \nresponse and health system preparedness package over two phases, totaling $5.22 billion. \nSeveral development partners, including ADB, supported phase 1 of the package.20 As a member \nof the South Asia Association of Regional Cooperation, India committed $10 million to an \nemergency fund. It also donated 7.85 million doses of vaccines to its neighboring countries before \nApril 2021.21 The government initiated the COVID-19 vaccination campaign on 16 January 2021. \n \n15 UN Women. 2021.

India is leveraging the \nexisting systems, infrastructure, and human resource capacity under its Universal Immunisation \nProgramme (UIP) for the rollout and expansion of the COVID-19 vaccination campaign.22 The \ncountry has a high level of readiness to implement the COVID-19 vaccination program based on \nthe World Health Organization (WHO) vaccine introduction readiness assessment tool and given \nthe ongoing vaccine rollout. The systems are described in paras. 13\u201323. However, given the scale \nof  the  vaccination  program,  some  improvements  are  needed,  such  as  (i)  increasing  the \ninvolvement of the private sector in COVID-19 vaccination; (ii) strengthening the monitoring of \nbiomedical waste management (BMWM); (iii) improving the monitoring of vaccination sites, \nincluding adverse events following immunization (AEFIs); and (iv) continuing efforts in risk \ncommunication and community engagement to ensure equitable access for all eligible population \ngroups. ADB TA is helping the government fill these gaps.23  \n \n13.  National  vaccine  road  map,  prioritization,  and  allocation  plan.  The  government \nformulated  the  National  Deployment  and  Vaccination  Plan (NDVP)  for  COVID-19  vaccines \nsupported by WHO and the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF).24 The National Expert \nGroup on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) has been guiding the government\u2019s \nvaccine deployment efforts since August 2020, and the National Technical Advisory Group on \nImmunization has been providing guidance in technical areas such as vaccine selection and \ncontradictions  for  vaccine  administration.  The  NDVP,  coupled  with  the  COVID-19  vaccine \noperational guidelines and the COVID-19 vaccine communication strategy, presents a robust and \ncomprehensive approach covering all key elements for vaccine deployment. The government also \nintroduced  various  measures  to  ensure  equitable  vaccination  for  all.  ADB's  Sustainable \nDevelopment and Climate Change Department issued a memo on 20 April 2021 confirming that \nIndia\u2019s NDVP meets the APVAX access criteria.  \n \n14.  The government aims to inoculate 944.7 million individuals aged 18 years old and older, \nwhich is 68.9% of the population. It is estimated that more than 1,988 million doses of vaccines \nwill be required for this purpose, based on the assumption of two vaccine doses per person and \na 5% wastage rate. The vaccine prioritization plan was divided into three phases (Table 2). The \nproject will support the vaccine needs for the eligible population in project states.25  \n \nTable 2: Vaccine Prioritization Plan for India \nEligible  No. of Doses \nPhase and Start  Population  % of Total  Required \nDate  Priority Group  (million)a  Population  (million) b \n \n1a  16Jan 2021  Health care workers  10.00  0.73%  21.05 \n1b  2 Feb 2021  Frontline workers  20.00  1.46%  42.11 \nSenior citizens (\u2265 60 years) \nand those aged 45\u201359 years \n2a  1 Mar 2021  with defined comorbidities  138.06  10.07%          290.65 \nc\n2b  1 Apr 2021  Population aged 45\u201359 years   209.32  15.27%          440.67 \n3  1 May 2021  Population aged 18\u201344 years  597.33  43.57%       1,257.54 \n    Total      944.71  68.91%       1,988.86 \na  The number of health care and frontline workers is counted in their respective age category, too. \n \n22 In 2015, the government also launched Mission Indradhanush targeting pockets of low immunization coverage and \nhard-to-reach areas of which experience and established systems provided a solid foundation to India\u2019s COVID-19 \nvaccine rollout efforts. \n23 Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24 NDVP in Annex III of National Vaccine Allocation Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2) \n25 The project states include Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya \nPradesh,  Rajasthan,  Karnataka,  Gujarat,  Odisha,  Kerala,  Jharkhand,  Assam,  Punjab,  Telangana,  Haryana, \nChhattisgarh, and Delhi, which have over 10 million eligible population. \n \n ", "6 \nb  Assuming a two-dose regime and 5% wastage.  \nc  People aged 45\u201359 years with comorbidities became eligible for vaccine access on 1 March 2021, along with the \npriority group of senior citizens (60 years and older); followed by all citizens 45 years and older from 1 April 2021. \nSource: Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  \n \n15.  Vaccine regulatory  pathways.  All  COVID-19 vaccines  in  India,  either  domestically \nmanufactured or imported, must comply with the requirements and guidelines specified in the \nDrugs and Cosmetics Rules 1945, New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules 2019, and other applicable \nguidelines published by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, the national regulatory \nauthority. The government also issued special regulatory guidelines for the development of \nCOVID-19  vaccines.26 Further,  regulatory  requirements  were  eased  for  vaccines  that  were \ngranted  emergency  approval  for  restricted  use  by  the  United  States  Food  and  Drug \nAdministration, European Medicines Agency, Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory \nAgency of the United Kingdom, and Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency of Japan, or \nwhich are recognized under the WHO Emergency Use Listing Procedure. This will help facilitate \nthe availability of imported vaccines, as well as the import of bulk drug material and optimal use \nof domestic fill-and-finish capacity.  \n \n16.  Vaccine  options.  India\u2019s  National  Vaccine  Policy  2011  outlines  the  criteria  for  the \nintroduction of vaccines, such as (i) safety and efficacy; (ii) affordability and financial sustainability; \n(iii)  program  capacity,  including  cold  chain  capacity;  and  (iv)  available  vaccine  production \ncapacity. As per the recommendations of the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization, \nIndia has been using the Covishield vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and the \nCovaxin vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech International Limited. In addition, Sputnik V, \ndeveloped by Gamaleya Research Institute, is being imported by Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories for \ndeployment  in  private  sector  facilities.  As  of  12  September  2021, three  additional  vaccine \ncandidates (Moderna, Janssen, and ZyCov-D) have emergency use authorization  from the \nCentral Drugs Standard Control Organization. Several other domestic vaccine candidates, such \nas Covovax, are in late-stage trials. However, the central government's current portfolio lists only \nfive vaccines\u2014Covishield, Covaxin, Sputnik V (domestic), ZyCov-D (being developed by Zydus \nCadila), and Corbevax (being developed by Biological E). Covishield and Covaxin are being \nconsidered for APVAX support.27 \n \n17.  Financing needs and funding sources. Vaccination of India's eligible population is \nestimated to cost $7,532 million (including $1,260 million in operational costs).28 Vaccine supplies \nare procured by the central government, the state governments, and the private sector, or \nreceived through donations. The central government launched the vaccination program with \n76 million donated doses.29 State governments supplied 45.6 million doses between 1 May and \n21 June 2021. When several states faced difficulties in procuring vaccines and expressed fiscal \ndistress, the central government decided to cover all public sector vaccine supplies, which \ndrastically increased its financing requirements. As of 12 September 2021, it had ordered \n \n26 Government  of  India,  Central  Drugs  Standard  Control  Organisation.  2020.  Draft  Regulatory  Guidelines  for \nDevelopment of Vaccines with Special Consideration for COVID-19 Vaccine. Delhi. \n27 Covishield and Covaxin have received WHO EUL meeting APVAX vaccine eligibility criterion 2. \n28 Operational costs are estimated at $0.19 per beneficiary for the central government component, at about $1.00 for \nthe state component, and at $2.05 for private sector use. The central component includes the cost of the Winning \nOver COVID-19 (Co-WIN) web portal (para. 21), SafeVac software for AEFI management, and associated call \ncenters. The state component has seven programmatic areas: (i) enumeration and microplanning, (ii) capacity \nbuilding, (iii) human resources, (iv) logistics and personal protective equipment, (v) cold chain and vaccine \ndistribution, (vi) information education activities, and (vii) monitoring.  \n29 Donated by the Prime Minister's Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations (PM-CARES) Fund \n(66 million doses) and the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) initiative (10 million doses). \n \n ", "7 \n1,245 million doses of Covishield and 355 million doses of Covaxin (covering 80.4% of the total \nvaccine doses needed). The order might further increase if private sector delivery continues to \nlag or if younger population groups are eventually included. The proposed project will help the \ncentral government meet its large and increasing financing requirements.  \n \n18.  Vaccine planning and coordination. India uses a whole-of-government approach to \nsupport the vaccine rollout. It also has a robust cascading system of decentralized planning, \ncoordination, and implementation arrangements (from central to state to district to block) with \nclearly defined roles and responsibilities. NEGVAC advises on all aspects of the COVID-19 \nvaccines, while the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MOHFW) supports the states in \nimplementing the national vaccination program. State, district, and block task forces were set up \nunder the guidance of state steering committees, and clear budget outlays are earmarked for \neach level. All levels run 24-7 operational control rooms. Overall AEFI management requires a \nhigh level of capacity to act upon emerging situations and possible trends. While the national AEFI \ncommittee has been reinforced, state and district AEFI committees require additional medical \nspecialists since COVID-19 vaccines still only have emergency use authorization and cover a \nwider population with different comorbidity profiles, which increases the risk of adverse events. \nADB TA through WHO is supporting this area.30 \n \n19.  Cold chain and logistic capacity. India has a fully operational cold chain system under \nthe UIP with four centrally run medical depots, 37 state vaccine stores, 118 regional vaccine \nstores, 726 district vaccine stores, and 28,575 subdistrict cold chain points in community health \ncenters,  primary  health  centers  (urban  and  rural),  and  subcenters.  Based  on  the  needs \nassessment conducted by UNICEF, cold chain gaps were bridged with domestic resources and \nsupport  from  Gavi,  the  Vaccine  Alliance  (Gavi),  KfW,  and  the  Government  of  Japan. \nManufacturers supply vaccines via air, rail, or insulated vans based on MOHFW\u2019s periodic \nguidance (roughly every 2 weeks) to four regional depots and 56 consignee points for further \ndelivery. Manufacturers also  transfer vaccines to private providers. The national cold chain \nmanagement information system and the electronic vaccine intelligence network system monitor \nreal-time cold chain capacity, availability of vaccine stock, and storage temperatures. \n \n20.  Service delivery. India has 234,772 COVID-19 vaccination centers (CVCs), of which \n215,927 are government-run and 18,845 are private. These are operated flexibly to also manage \nroutine services. The system has sufficient human resource capacity31\u2014with the option to engage \nadditional human resources on a temporary basis by mobilizing retired auxiliary nurse midwives, \nretired staff nurses or nursing assistants, pharmacists, lab technicians, and nursing students. At \nleast five people are required in each team to undertake verification and crowd management, \nensure COVID-19-appropriate behavior, monitor vaccination procedures, and watch out for any \npotential AEFIs. A supervisor is responsible for three to five vaccination sites. All private facilities \nempaneled under various insurance schemes and any other private facilities that meet the \noperational requirements have been engaged. However, private sector delivery is lagging the \nplanned contribution rate (7% instead of up to 25%). The World Bank and ADB TA are advising \non how to improve private sector engagement and are supporting capacity building.32  \n \n21.  Digital systems for vaccination. Winning Over COVID-19 (Co-WIN) is an end-to-end, \ncloud-based electronic solution for the planning, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of \n \n30 ADB. 2020.

It is used in \nsync with the electronic vaccine intelligence network under the UIP. Registration on this platform \nis mandatory to record vaccination data and ensure transparency and accountability. The use of \nCo-WIN also ensures that (i) verifiable data is available on the number of persons vaccinated, \n(ii) a second dose of the same vaccine is provided, (iii) the prescribed time between doses is \nmaintained, (iv) vaccine certificates are generated, (v) the vaccine is administered only after \nverification of the individual's identity, and (vi) the data is useful for future pandemic research and \nplanning. Co-WIN also allows the program managers to (i) monitor real-time vaccination progress \noverall or for a specific state, district, or population group; (ii) monitor vaccine availability and \nutilization for improved planning; (iii) assess vaccine wastage and take measures to minimize it; \nand (iv) offer ease of reference for future interventions, such as administration of booster doses. \nCo-WIN is linked to other systems such as Aarogya Setu (mobile app), DigiLocker (digital wallet), \nand Umang (pan-Indian e-government services) for the download of vaccination certificates. The \nsystem is also integrated with the WHO-supported SafeVac for monitoring AEFIs. This allows for \nAEFI cases to be analyzed by using both automated data-mining and appropriate statistical \nmethodologies to detect concerning trends. The Co-WIN system handles more than 1 billion visits \ndaily and recorded 3.1 billion visits in one day to book vaccine slots. Since 2020, ADB TA has \nbeen supporting the data analytics-driven \u2018war room\u2019 that developed Co-WIN dashboards for \nbetter monitoring and evaluation (footnote 30). Co-WIN will be audited by the Comptroller and \nAuditor General of India to ensure system and data integrity and to identify areas for further \nimprovement, lessons, and best practices. \n \n22.  Immunization waste management. Any health care activities will generate biomedical \nwaste (BMW), including immunization waste. India has 202 common biomedical waste treatment \nfacilities (CBMWTFs) in operation, and 35 additional facilities are under construction. They can \nhandle about 840 tons of BMW per day. The country currently generates about 619 tons per day \nof overall BMW, including COVID-19-related BMW. In addition to CBMWTFs, health care facilities \nalso  have  captive  BMW  treatment  systems.  India  has  an  extensive  regulatory  framework \ngoverning  the  management  of  BMW  (BMWM):  the  BMWM  Rules  2016  (and  subsequent \namendments)  outline  the  overall  compliance  requirements  in  BMW  generation,  storage, \ntransportation, disinfection, treatment, and disposal, while the BMWM guidelines under UIP 2021 \nfocus on waste from the COVID-19 immunization program. Regular training sessions on BMWM \nare conducted for health care and frontline workers with WHO support, and the Central Pollution \nControl Board provides regular training on the maintenance and evaluation of CBMWTFs. In \naddition, the Supreme Court has made the use of a BMW tracking application (COVID19BWM) \nmandatory for  all  waste  generators,  transporters,  and  operators  of treatment  and  disposal \nfacilities. However, monitoring compliance at CVCs with the various guidelines for adequate and \nsafe source segregation is a challenge, as are the varying levels of management capacity across \ndifferent states. ADB TA is monitoring CVCs\u2019 compliance with guidelines and associated capacity \nbuilding efforts (footnote 32). \n \n23.  Reaching all and overcoming vaccine hesitancy. India\u2019s COVID-19 communication \nstrategy pays particular attention to equitable access to vaccines for all. For those without access \nto the internet or smartphones, registration on Co-WIN can be done onsite at CVCs or through \nthe 1075 helpline call center, and in more than 267,000 common services centers. About 78% of \ndoses are administered after onsite registration, 56% are administered in rural areas, and the \nvaccination ratio in tribal areas is higher than the national average. States also conducted more \nthan 920,000 sessions in CVCs within easy reach of senior citizens, differently abled people, and \nrural residents by 12 September 2021. Some states or municipal corporations provide additional \nservices such as beneficiary transportation. Special vaccination sessions are also conducted for \n \n ", "9 \npeople without identification or with other restrictions.33 Moreover, all the vaccination sites or \noutreach centers have at least one female health worker or volunteer to assist women\u2019s access.34 \nMOHFW leads the vaccine communication hub with support from UNICEF, WHO, and other \npartners that help monitor media reporting and respond to misinformation. However, to achieve \nfull vaccination coverage, including in hard-to-reach areas, and mitigate the risk of vaccine \nhesitancy, ADB TA is supporting dynamic data analysis as well as targeted risk communication \nand community engagement activities in rural and remote areas that help overcome demand-side \nbarriers, especially among women and other vulnerable population segments. \n \n4.  Development Partner Coordination  \n \n24.  A development partner coordination mechanism led by WHO has been very effective in \ncoordinating ongoing and planned technical and financial support for the pandemic response. A \nsubgroup specific to the COVID-19 vaccine rollout was formed and includes ADB, Gavi, the \nUnited  Nations  Development  Programme,  UNICEF,  WHO,  and  the  World  Bank.  ADB  has \ncoordinated loan and TA support to the government since the COVID-19 outbreak. In addition to \nvaccine finance from partners such as ADB and AIIB, technical support is being provided by WHO, \nUNICEF,  United  Nations  Development  Programme,  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, Gavi, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, KfW, Japan International Cooperation \nAgency, the Government of Japan, and the Global Fund.35  \n \nB.  Project Description   \n \n1.  Impact and Outcome \n \n25.  The project is aligned with the following impact: accelerated health, social, and economic \nrecovery from COVID-19 in India. It will have the following outcome: eligible population safely \nvaccinated  against  COVID-19  in  project  states  (footnote  25);  the  aim  is  to  cover  at  least \n317 million beneficiaries, 47.5% of them women.36 \n \n2.  Outputs \n \n26.  Output: Safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines supplied for eligible population in \nproject states. The project will support the procurement of safe and effective vaccines against \nCOVID-19 through APVAX's RRC. It will procure at least 667 million doses of vaccines, which will \nbe administered to a target population by 2024 in accordance with the current NDVP for COVID-\n19 vaccines and any subsequent guidelines. The eligible vaccines will be procured through \nbilateral arrangements with vaccine manufacturers or distributors.  \n \n27.  Value addition. Ongoing ADB TA (footnote 32) is supporting the national COVID-19 \nvaccination program implementation by (i) augmenting the project management capacity of its \nImmunization Division with consultants on the monitoring, reporting, and evaluation of the vaccine \nrollout; (ii) assisting the vaccination site monitoring; (iii) carrying out dynamic analysis of data \n \n33 Nomads, prison inmates, patients in mental health institutions, citizens in old-age homes, roadside beggars, people \nresiding in rehabilitation centers or camps, and any other individuals found eligible. More than 821,000 individuals \nhave received vaccines without identification as of 12 September 2021. \n34 Vaccination sites are supported by community mobilizers and outreach workers, including more than 1 million women \naccredited social health activists, 1.4 million Anganwadi workers (Anganwadi is a type of rural childcare center), 1.28 \nmillion Anganwadi helpers, and 100,000 nongovernment and civil society organizations.  \n35 Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n36 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "10 \nsegregated by gender, rural and urban, and priority groups to aid decision-making; (iv) assisting \nprivate providers (both workplace and independent vaccine providers) with capacity building and \nmonitoring  their  compliance  with  guidelines;  (v)  supporting  vaccination-related  BMWM  and \ndisposal  monitoring;  (vi)  increasing  awareness  of  and  willingness  for  vaccination  among \nvulnerable people, especially women; and (vii) strengthening the capacity for monitoring and \nmanaging AEFIs. All TA activities are designed to underpin national and state government efforts, \nensure equitable access, and build the capacity of stakeholders, including women, while creating \nsynergy with the proposed vaccine financing as well as other health sector interventions of ADB. \nThe TA activities are supported by WHO and UNICEF through their respective administrative \narrangements with ADB, under the overall coordination of the Immunization Division of MOHFW. \n \n3.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan  \n \n28.  Project proposal. The project is estimated to cost $2,057.77 million, including vaccine \ncosts, taxes, contingencies, interest, commitment charges during implementation, and other \nfinancial  charges.  The  summary  cost  estimates  are  in  Table  3.  The  project  will  finance \nexpenditures in relation to the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines that meet the APVAX eligibility \ncriteria.

Loan  financing  from  ADB  and  Asian  Infrastructure  Investment  Bank.  The \ngovernment requested a loan of $500 million and a loan of $1 billion, both from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources, to help finance the vaccine procurement. The first loan will have a 10-year term, \nincluding a grace period of 3 years; the second loan will have a 5-year term, including a grace \nperiod of 3 years; both with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such \nother terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan agreements. The government has also \nrequested a loan of $500 million from AIIB to help finance the vaccine procurement.38 Its terms \nand conditions will be described in a loan agreement between the government and AIIB. ADB will \npartially administer the AIIB loan as per a co-lenders' agreement between ADB and AIIB. \n \n30.  Government contributions.

Key findings from debt sustainability analysis. The fiscal deficit widened to 9.2% of \nGDP in FY2021 as the government focused on mitigating the effects of the pandemic and \nsupporting economic recovery. This widening and the contraction of the economy contributed to \nan increase in the ratio of public debt to GDP from 72.2% in FY2020 to 89.1% in FY2021. The \nratio is expected to remain elevated (above 80%) in the medium term, but with risks broadly \ncontained. GDP growth is expected to be 10% in FY2022, 7.5% in FY2023, and 6.5% in the \nmedium term. The fiscal deficit is budgeted at 6.8% for FY2022, and the government plans to \nreduce it gradually to below 4.5% of GDP by FY2026. Further, India\u2019s public debt is predominantly \nheld by domestic residents and is denominated largely in domestic currency, which helps reduce \nexternal financing risks. Nevertheless, improving the fiscal conditions and domestic resource \nmobilization should remain a priority for the government beyond the pandemic. This assessment \non debt sustainability is consistent with the recent International Monetary Fund analysis.39 \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n32.  MOHFW  will  be  the  executing  agency,  and  its  Immunization  Division  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The division will coordinate all aspects of project implementation with other \nMOHFW divisions and units, other agencies, and the project states, which will strengthen project-\nspecific planning, monitoring and evaluation, reporting, and coordination requirements,  and \nsatisfy ADB's project administration requirements. \n \n33.  Procurement will be undertaken following simplified and expedient procedures permitted \nunder the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).40 As per APVAX policy, \nADB member country eligibility restrictions will be waived. Since the vaccine supply has been \nlimited to a few vaccine manufacturers globally and given the urgent need to vaccinate a large \npopulation, MOHFW has procured and will procure the vaccines through direct contracting by \n \n39 International Monetary Fund Assessment Letter.

The project will finance a portion of these \ncontracts for APVAX-eligible vaccines. MOHFW has engaged a procurement agent funded by the \ngovernment to support procurement, contract management, and delivery of the vaccines (para. \n38). Before confirming eligible expenditure under the project, ADB will review all relevant vaccine \nagreements. Value for money in procurement will be achieved by (i) selecting vaccines that are \nbest suited to the domestic supply chain; (ii) identifying vaccines that will efficiently meet the \nproject  disbursement  conditions;  (iii) engaging  with  manufacturers  that  have  advantageous \nvaccine delivery timelines; and (iv) entering into agreements on terms and conditions that are \nreasonable,  noting  the  currently  constrained  vaccine  market  globally.  ADB's  Anticorruption \nPolicy41 (1998, as amended to date) will apply to all contracts to be financed under the project. \n \n34.

The COVID-19 pandemic is a health, economic, and social crisis resulting in loss of lives, \nan increase in morbidity, loss of livelihood, a slowdown of the economy, and disruptions to \neducation and human capital development for long-term economic growth. In the absence of \nvaccinations, the costs of the pandemic could be prolonged and exacerbated. The potential \ncontribution toward herd immunity against COVID-19 through vaccinations will substantially \nreduce mortality and morbidity and help resume economic activities and thus restore livelihoods. \n \n \n41 ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy. Manila. \n42 Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "13 \nB.  Governance  \n \n36.  The  national  COVID-19  vaccination  program  has  well-structured  and  functioning \ngovernance arrangements despite the complex federal setting. The program systems, supported \nby strong digital platforms, are adequate to ensure that the resources are used for equitable and \npriority-based allocation of vaccines and can transparently track vaccine doses and beneficiaries. \nGiven  the  importance,  the  national  COVID-19  vaccination  program  is  subject  to  intensive \noversights by NEGVAC, the Prime Minister\u2019s office, the Parliament as well as the Supreme Court, \nin addition to the usual oversight mechanisms. Various oversight and independent assurance \nactivities will prevent and detect key integrity risks. Various mechanisms for grievance redressal \nare in place to deal with beneficiary concerns. The Comptroller and Auditor General will carry out \na performance audit of the national vaccination program to provide additional assurance of sound \ngovernance, effectiveness, efficiency, and economy of the program.  \n \n37.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary  measures  are \ndescribed in the PAM (footnote 42).  \n \n38.  Strategic procurement planning was carried out, including a capacity assessment of the \nexecuting, and implementing agencies. Under the guidance of NEGVAC, MOHFW has directly \nprocured COVID-19 vaccines from manufacturers, and engaged HLL Lifecare Limited (HLL), a \ngovernment-owned enterprise under MOHFW, as a procurement agent to support procurement \nand contract management. HLL has the knowledge, capacity, experience, and track record to \nprovide the required services. Based on the overall assessment, the project\u2019s procurement risk is \nrated  substantial,  mainly  because  of  the  unprecedented  scale  and  complexity  of  vaccine \ndeployment that may strain MOHFW capacity. To mitigate this risk, MOHFW will continue using \nthe services of HLL, financed by the government, to manage the vaccine supply contracts. \n \n39.  ADB conducted a financial management assessment for the project. The pre-mitigation \nfinancial management risk is substantial primarily because of the unprecedented scale and \ncomplexity of vaccine deployment. The project will follow the existing country systems and \nleverage the existing financial management capacity of MOHFW. The ongoing ADB TA will assist \nMOHFW  in  meeting  ADB-specific  financial  management  requirements.  The  key  financial \nmanagement risks identified are (i) the lack of a dedicated sub-budget head for the project, which \nmay lead to inconsistent financial monitoring and reporting; (ii) non-inclusion of the project in the \nannual internal audit workplan, which may result in funds or vaccines being misused; and (iii) \ndelay in submitting audited project financial statements to ADB. These risks will be mitigated by \n(i) establishing a sub-budget head for the project, (ii) including the project in the annual internal \naudit workplan, (iii) ensuring timely submission of project financial statements to the Comptroller \nand Auditor General for timely audit, and (iv) monitoring quarterly progress reports, including audit \nobservations and the status of implementation of audit recommendations. \n \nC.  Poverty, Social, and Gender  \n \n40.  Poverty and social considerations. The COVID-19 pandemic has reversed many gains \nmade by India in poverty alleviation and health outcomes, and exacerbated inequality. Affordable \nvaccines and equitable access are critical. While the government offers free vaccination in public \nfacilities, demand-side constraints such as lack of awareness, hesitancy, and other barriers \nshould be removed to ensure that all eligible individuals benefit. The government is implementing \nthe COVID-19 vaccination communication strategy with support from various partners; introduced \nseveral flexible delivery modes such as near-to-home vaccination, workplace vaccination, and \n \n ", "14 \ncommunity outreach; and has been guiding the states on how to handle different types of barriers \n(e.g., lack of a recognized identity card). The states also provide additional support to those faced \nwith access barriers.  \n \n41.  Gender equality and social inclusion. The project is categorized effective gender \nmainstreaming. A gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan has been agreed with \nMOHFW. The project aims to achieve the vaccination of about 317 million people, at least 47.5% \nof them women. Vaccination will allow women to reestablish their income-earning activities and \naccess health care services and will lessen their burden of care work. The project will also build \nwomen's capacity for vaccination-supporting activities. The GESI action plan targets include (i) a \n50% increase in knowledge  about COVID-19 prevention and management, and COVID-19 \nvaccines among vulnerable population groups\u2014e.g., the poor, aged, disabled, those from rural \nand remote areas, and disadvantaged minorities\u2014with a special focus on women, in 10 out of 19 \nproject  states;  (ii) at  least  20  partner  institutions  or  networks  working  with  disadvantaged \ncommunities,  especially  women,  trained  as  master  trainers  to  facilitate  the  country-wide \npromotion  of  COVID-19-appropriate  behaviors,  and  the  dissemination  of  COVID-19-related \ninformation and vaccine communication; (iii) at least 2,000 staff involved in BMW generation, \nmanagement, and disposal (at least 40% of them women) trained; and at least 200 civil society \nand nongovernment organizations trained in amplifying the message of environmentally sound \nBMWM; and (iv) dynamic analyses of Co-WIN data (disaggregated by location, gender, priority \nvulnerable groups) to support timely policymaking. The Immunization Division, AIIB, and ADB will \njointly monitor progress in implementing the GESI action plan. \n \nD.  Environment and Social Safeguards  \n \n42.  In compliance with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009),43 the project's safeguard \ncategories are as follows.44 \n \n43.  Environment (category C). The project supports the procurement and delivery of COVID-\n19  vaccines  and  does  not  entail  activities  with  potentially  adverse  environmental  impacts. \nHowever, the administration of vaccines will generate BMW, which will require safe treatment and \ndisposal. ADB carried out due diligence on the current regulatory framework governing BMW, and \nthe capacity for adequate management and disposal of BMW generated by the vaccination \nprogram.45 The incremental increase in BMW from the vaccination program is estimated at \n50 tons per day, or 4.2% of total BMW generation in the country. Project states have adequate \nexisting and planned capacity to handle the incremental waste. In addition, ADB TA has been \nsupporting (i) the monitoring of CVCs' compliance with BMWM and source segregation standards, \n(ii) training of more than 2,000 staff involved in BMWM, (iii) the formulation of guidelines for safe \ndeep burial or incineration, and (iv) training of nongovernment and civil society organizations in \nraising awareness of safe BMWM and advocating sustained public interest in this issue. \n44.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). The project does not involve civil works and will \nnot  require  any  land  acquisition.  It  will  not  result  in  any  involuntary  resettlement  impacts.  \n \n45.  Indigenous peoples (category C). While indigenous communities are present in the \ncountry, they will not be targeted as distinct and vulnerable indigenous peoples as a group, as \ndefined by ADB\u2019s applicable safeguard policies, but they may benefit as individual indigenous \n \n43 ADB. 2009.

The project will ensure that members of indigenous groups will not be excluded and will \nnot suffer any disadvantages in targeting because they belong to an indigenous people group. \nThe proposed loan is not expected to have any direct or indirect impacts on the dignity, human \nrights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples, or the territories or natural or cultural \nresources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as an ancestral domain or asset. \n \nE.
