Technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for New Models for \nCivil  Society  Participation  in  Poverty  Reduction  was  included  in  ADB\u2019s  2008  nonlending \nprogram for the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) following the Government\u2019s request made \nduring the April 2007 PRC Country Program Midterm Review Mission. Dialogue with the State \nCouncil Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development (LGOP), Ministry of \nFinance,  China  Foundation  for  Poverty  Alleviation  (CFPA),  and  other  government  and \nnongovernment entities at the central level, as well as during a mission to Jiangxi Province \n(26\u221229 July 2008), clarified the policy and institutional context and priorities for ADB support. \nAgreement  was  reached  with  the  Government  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  PRC  has  made  significant  progress  in  poverty  reduction,  decreasing  absolute \npoverty from roughly 250 million people in 1978 to 14.8 million in 2007 (using the official annual \nper capita income line of CNY785). Persistent and emerging challenges remain, however, as \nreflected in a deceleration in poverty reduction despite rising government support. Inasmuch as \npoverty is increasingly concentrated in hard-to-reach and vulnerable groups (e.g., women and \nthe elderly, ethnic minorities, and those living on remote and/or degraded land), better targeting \nand innovative new approaches that broaden and deepen grassroots participation are required.  \n \n3.   In  light  of  global  experience,  the  government  increasingly  recognizes  the  largely \nuntapped potential of civil society actors\u2014including nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and \nnascent volunteerism and corporate social responsibility (CSR)\u2014as partners in state-supported \npoverty work. Developing new models and mechanisms for mobilizing civil society in poverty \nprograms  will  also  be  central  to  achieving  national  goals  of  people-centered  development \ntowards  a  \u201charmonious  society.\u201d  To  date,  however,  the  lack  of  a  supportive  institutional \nenvironment and workable mechanisms has limited the extent and efficacy of civil society\u2019s role \nin poverty reduction in the PRC. With notable exceptions (e.g., civil society\u2019s response to the 12 \nMay  2008  Wenchuan,  Sichuan  earthquake),  contributions  by  NGOs,  volunteers,  and  CSR \nactors in poverty-related areas have tended to be smaller than in many other Asian countries \nand are generally not coordinated with state programs. Evidence on the impact of civil society \nparticipation is needed to support related policy dialogue and development of viable approaches.  \n \n4.  The TA is identified in, and directly supports, ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the \nPRC (2008\u20132010)2, which identifies promoting partnerships between the government and civil \nsociety in poverty reduction and other programs as a key ADB niche area. It builds on prior and \nongoing initiatives supported by ADB3 and other organizations.4  In particular, it embeds the \nresults  of  ADB  assistance  to  LGOP  and  the  Jiangxi  Province  Poverty  Alleviation  and \nDevelopment Office (PADO) to explore new ways of mainstreaming NGOs into village poverty \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 July 2008.  \n2   ADB. 2008. Country Partnership Strategy (2008 - 2010): People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n3  These include prior ADB support to LGOP on poor village identification and participatory projects, and ongoing \nsupport to the Ministry of Civil Affairs (which is responsible for registering NGOs in the PRC) to assess international \nmodels and policy options for outsourcing public services to NGOs. ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for Facility for Reform Support and Capacity Building. Manila (TA 4790-PRC). \n4  These range from World Bank-coordinated support on community-driven development to initiatives by such NGOs \nas Asia Foundation and Give2Asia, Ford Foundation, and Youcheng Chinese Social Entrepreneurship Foundation. \n ", "2   \nalleviation and development planning (VPADP), the PRC\u2019s flagship grassroots poverty program. \nEarlier TA regarding NGO-government partnerships in village-level poverty alleviation5 designed \nand  successfully  pilot  tested  viable  methods  and  procedures  to  support  the  PRC\u2019s  first \nsystematic channeling of budgetary poverty funds through competitively selected NGOs that \nfacilitate the villager-driven VPADP and work closely with local governments. Monitoring and \nevaluation (M&E) under that TA identified key advantages of NGO-government cooperation,6 as \nwell as areas for further improvement. As a second generation of that pilot in Jiangxi Province, \nthe proposed TA will introduce three complementary innovations, helping the Government to  \n(i)  refine and pilot test improved modalities pioneered under TA 4580-PRC for NGO-\nGovernment  partnership  within  VPADP,  including  via  enhanced  operational \nguidelines and applied capacity building to better tap NGOs\u2019 and local governments\u2019 \ncomparative advantages;  \n(ii)  develop mechanisms to mobilize financial and human resources from other civil \nsociety actors (i.e., volunteers and CSR actors) within national poverty reduction \nefforts; and  \n(iii)  explore the introduction of a second wave of interventions in order to shift from a \none-shot VPADP to a sequential two-pronged approach to village poverty reduction \nthat further enhances villager self-development capacities and sustainable impacts.  \nFindings  from  this  pilot  test,  along  with  broader  institutional  analysis  and  international \nexperience, will feed into national-level policy dialogue and recommendations for reform.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The impact of the TA is reduced rural poverty, with NGOs and other civil society actors \nmainstreamed within more effective, responsive, targeted, and sustainable poverty reduction \nprograms across the PRC. The TA\u2019s outcome is formulation and demonstration of replicable \nmodels (and mechanisms) for civil society participation in national poverty reduction programs.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The TA will have three components, with the core outputs and deliverables noted below.    \n \n7.  Component  1:  Analysis  and  Framework  Formulation. The core output will be a \nframework for civil society participation in national poverty reduction programs that incorporates \ndemonstrated models and mechanisms plus concrete recommendations for institutional and \npolicy reform. Early in the TA, an inception report will analyze key issues (e.g., institutional7 and \ncapacity-related  barriers),  as  well  as  ways  to  link  potential  support  from  civil  society  and \ngovernment actors for meeting needs in poor areas. Building in particular on findings regarding \nNGOs  from  TA  4580-PRC,  the  report  will  assess  international  experience  and  models  for \nmobilizing volunteers and CSR actors within poverty-related programs. It will propose specific \nmechanisms for inclusion in the pilot test (component 2). The TA\u2019s first major workshop will then \njointly  (i)  launch  competitive  selection  of  NGOs  for  the  VPADP  sub-pilot,  and  (ii)  discuss \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Nongovernment Organization-Government \nPartnerships in Village-Level Poverty Alleviation. Manila  (TA 4580-PRC, to be completed in October 2008).  \n6  Evidence from TA 4580-PRC demonstrates that NGO-Government cooperation boosts participation and poverty \ntargeting under the VPADP, which directs state funds to such villager-identified subprojects as local roads, \nirrigation, and support for income-generation activities. The new pilot will explore further enhancements. \n7  For example, while the China Rural Poverty Alleviation and Development Outline (2001\u20132010) calls for NGO \nparticipation, there is no clear framework to support broader civil society engagement in poverty programs. \n ", "  3\nanalysis to date and review design work for the second sub-pilot (see para. 9[ii]). The main \ndeliverables will be a final report and focused synopsis monograph (targeted at policymakers \nand distilling key policy and institutional recommendations), which will be finalized after review \nby the TA\u2019s final policy forum. \n \n8.  Component 2: Support for Two-Pronged Pilot Test. The output is a successfully \ncompleted pilot test that proves new mechanisms are viable in target localities. Supporting this \noutput, the TA will (i) develop operational guidelines for the pilot test (see para. 9), (ii) build key \ncapacities among government and civil society proponents (via training and other modalities), (iii) \ndevelop networks and launch a public advocacy campaign, and (iv) disseminate operational \nguidelines and core resource materials to support replication. \n \n9.  Building  on  and  refining  mechanisms  developed  under  TA  4580-PRC,  the  TA  will \nsupport a second-generation pilot test that focuses on the roles of NGOs, engages an array of \nother civil society actors in building villagers\u2019 self-development capacities, and enhances the \nsustainability of poverty reduction interventions. The pilot will support LGOP and Jiangxi PADO \nin (i) further refining the existing VPADP program to improve targeting, participation by women \nand the poor, and the impact of VPADP investments; and (ii) introducing the noted new second \nwave of interventions. The TA will thus include two sub-pilots, focused on the following: \n(i)  Comprising the first wave, an enhanced VPADP will lay a foundation for pro-poor \ndevelopment  by  providing  village-level  infrastructure  (i.e.,  \u201chardware\u201d;  see \nfootnote  6)  and  empowering  villagers  and  instilling  basic  self-development \ncapacities, providing key \u201csoftware\u201d building blocks. \n(ii)  As  elaborated  in  Appendix  2,  the  second  wave  of  interventions  specifically \nfocuses on software\u2014namely, capacity building for villagers and village-level \norganizations and support for grassroots initiatives (e.g., self-help groups and \nmicrofinance) to reduce local poverty. It builds on the foundations created by the \nfirst wave\u2019s participatory VPADP process while enhancing the sustainability of \nthose benefits from the government\u2019s initial VPADP investment.  \n \n10.  In the first of two sub-pilots, the TA will further refine the model developed under TA \n4580 for NGO-government partnership within the VPADP, replicating this improved model in \ntentatively eight villages in up to three counties of Jiangxi (selected from Le\u2019an, Ningdu, and \nXingguo counties). Under the second sub-pilot, the TA will develop and test a model and \nmechanisms for the second wave. This will include the design and launch of a new facility for \npoverty reduction via villager development (PRVD). The PRVD facility will provide a platform for \nmobilizing civil society (NGO, volunteer, and CSR) human and financial resources for village-\nlevel software initiatives, and it will include an open charitable fund (see Appendix 2). Findings \nfrom component 1 analysis and close dialogue with potential partners8 will guide the design and \nlaunch of various mechanisms linked to the PRVD facility, including advocacy and information \ndissemination,  networking  and  fundraising,  fund  management,  volunteer  mobilization,  and \nbroader capacity building. A multi-stakeholder midterm workshop will assess progress, refine \nthe pilot-test model, and seek to mobilize additional funding and partnerships under the PRVD \nfacility. Under the TA, ADB and Jiangxi PADO will provide seed funding to initiate this facility. \nDuring  and  beyond  the  TA\u2019s  completion,  the  facility  would  be  administered  by  CFPA  and \npotentially could be expanded to other villages in Jiangxi and/or other provinces.9     \n                                                 \n8  These include national and international NGOs and other organizations, various CSR actors, and the media. While \npreliminary and non-committal, discussions with the Asia, Ford, and Youcheng foundations and Give2Asia suggest \nprospects for collaboration. \n9  Midterm and final reports under component 1 will assess options for replication to other localities both during the \nTA\u2019s latter half and after the TA.   \n ", "4   \n \n11.  Component 3: Monitoring and Evaluation. The core output will be an M&E report for \nthe pilot test. Independently prepared by an M&E consultant, the report will assess the extent, \nefficacy, and impact of civil society participation in state-supported poverty programs. The M&E \nstrategy will include a baseline and four subsequent surveys as well as detailed case study \ninvestigations to capture both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of processes and impacts. \nThe consultant terms of reference (Appendix 3) outline key aspects of the M&E strategy.    \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $1,300,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will contribute an estimated $800,000 equivalent, \nincluding (i) in-kind contribution for counterpart staff, office space in Jiangxi PADO and local \nsites, administrative support, local transportation, and the like; (ii) budgetary poverty alleviation \nfunding for NGO-facilitated, villager-driven projects in VPADP sub-pilot villages; and (iii) seed \nfunding to support the PRVD facility under sub-pilot 2 in parallel with ADB funding. CFPA will \nprovide an estimated $100,000 equivalent, principally in-kind, including counterpart staff and \nallowances,  travel  (excluding  a  TA-financed  portion),  field  offices,  plus  logistical  and \nadministration costs. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  LGOP will be the Executing Agency for the TA, which is expected to be implemented \nfrom November 2008 to November 2010. LGOP will directly oversee policy-related and other \ncentral-level activities, delegating responsibilities to Jiangxi PADO and/or CFPA as appropriate. \nReporting to LGOP, Jiangxi PADO will oversee day-to-day implementation of the pilot test \nsupported under component 2, guiding CFPA and the TA experts (see para. 15 and Appendix 3). \nJiangxi PADO will also facilitate analysis, local policy dialogue, and pilot test implementation, \nincluding  coordination  across  bureaus  and  levels.  Through  Jiangxi  PADO,  as  appropriate, \nLGOP will ensure (i) timely provision of (a) budgetary poverty alleviation funds, (b) a project \noffice at Jiangxi PADO, and (c) other agreed government counterpart inputs noted above and in \nAppendix  4;  (ii)  sound  administration  of  certain  ADB  TA  funds;10  and  (iii)  cross-agency \ncoordination, including efforts to mobilize technical support and human and financial resources \nfrom  other  agencies  and  entities  and  facilitating  access  to  information  and  government \ncommunication  channels.  LGOP  will  chair  a  central-level  policy  review  group  to  facilitate \ninteragency coordination and review TA findings at key junctures11 to help ensure accuracy and \npolicy relevance while promoting cross-agency support for actualizing final recommendations on \npolicy,  strategy,  and  reforms.  Jiangxi  PADO  will  conduct  vertical  and  horizontal  liaison  as \nneeded.  It  will  chair  meetings  of  a  provincial  coordination  group12  to  support  pilot  test \npreparation and implementation, and it will facilitate policy dialogue and sharing of lessons. \nNear TA completion, LGOP will  spearhead advocacy and intra-government consultation to \npromote post-TA replication of successfully piloted elements and broader reform. \n                                                 \n10 Subject to prior agreement by ADB, this includes certain workshops and other activities. LGOP may also delegate \nadministration of these activities to CFPA, as needed.  \n11 Maintaining dialogue under TA 4580-PRC, the group tentatively will include representatives of LGOP, Ministry of \nFinance (providing the vice chair), Ministry of Civil Affairs, and National Development and Reform Commission. It \nwill meet shortly after TA inception, during midterm review, prior to the final policy forum, and otherwise as needed.   \n12 This tentatively will include representatives of (i) provincial bureaus under the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Civil \nAffairs, and National Development and Reform Commission; (ii) CFPA; as well as (iii) county-level PADOs and \nother agencies, as needed.  \n ", "  5\n \n14.  LGOP has appointed CFPA, a leading national-level NGO and cofinancing partner, to \nact as implementing agency for the pilot test supported by the TA. CFPA will coordinate directly \nwith ADB and report to LGOP and Jiangxi PADO, as needed. CFPA has demonstrated capacity \nin transparent fund management and implementing programs ranging from microfinance to \nparticipatory poverty reduction, including to act as implementing agency for the Jiangxi pilot test \nunder TA 4580. LGOP, Jiangxi PADO, and CFPA will contribute skilled staff as part of their \ncounterpart support. Working closely with ADB staff, consultants, and resource persons, CFPA \nwill take lead responsibility in (i) finalizing the design of the VPADP sub-pilot and PRVD facility \nsub-pilot,  including  via  workshops  and  other  multi-stakeholder  development  processes;  (ii) \nimplementing (with support as needed from ADB-fielded experts) capacity building programs in \nparallel for (a) civil society actors and communities, and (b) local governments to support \ninitiatives under each sub-pilot; (iii) independently and transparently administering funds for both \nsub-pilots,  including  government  VPADP  funds,  ADB  counterpart  contribution,  and  multi-\nstakeholder  contributions  to  the  PRVD  facility  that  is  expected  to  be  sustained  after  TA \ncompletion; and (iv) coordinating other aspects of pilot implementation according to procedures \nto be formulated and agreed with LGOP and ADB early in the TA. CFPA will also provide basic \nstaffing and facilities in selected localities to support TA-funded activities and complementary \nCFPA  activities  (e.g.,  microfinance).  At  least  biannually,  CFPA  will  provide  ADB  progress \nreports, as well as activity proposals outlining expenses eligible for TA funding related to (i) \nbasic  equipment; 13   (ii)  materials  development,  production,  and  dissemination;  and  (iii) \nworkshops, field investigations, and other agreed activities.14  \n \n15.  ADB funds administered by LGOP, Jiangxi PADO, and CFPA for workshops, pilot test \nsupport, capacity building, and other agreed activities will be based on budgeted work plans. To \nfacilitate  implementation,  ADB  will  establish  separate  advance  payment  facilities  for  these \nentities in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as \namended from time to time). To build on CFPA and other partners\u2019 capacity and ownership, \nADB will recruit (i) two national consultants (6 person-months each) to support policy dialogue \nand pilot-test design under component 1 and to provide external and independent M&E under \ncomponent 3, respectively; and (ii) flexibly deployed resource persons (estimated at 30 person-\ndays international and 50 person-days national) to advise on mechanism design and policy \nbased on international best practice, support CFPA-implemented capacity building linked to the \npilot test, and provide other needed expertise. The international and national consultants will be \nselected and engaged as individuals according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Their terms of reference and principal deliverables are in \nAppendix 3. In addition to a CFPA-hosted project website and the advocacy campaign and \ndissemination  supported  under  component  2,  broad  dissemination  of  key  policy  and  M&E \nreports (in English and Chinese) will support policy dialogue. CFPA will procure equipment in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for New Models for Civil Society Participation \nin Poverty Reduction, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n13 Tentatively includes two laptop computers and other basic computer equipment to support pilot administration and \noversight. These are to be transferred to LGOP or allocated by LGOP at TA completion.  \n14 This may include lodging and travel allowances for local government participants in workshops, transportation and \naccommodation for CFPA and (adding basic honoraria) non-CFPA facilitators for agreed activities, etc. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicatorsa   Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nImpact      Assumptions \nReduced rural poverty,  By 2015:    \u2022  Steady government \nwith nongovernment  \u2022  Legislation, policy, and  Tracking of policy reform and  support for \norganizations (NGOs)  strategy in place for  disaggregated figures for  participatory poverty \nand other civil society  integrating civil society  poverty reduction budgeting,  reduction strategies, \nactors mainstreamed  actors in state poverty  including funds channeled  and acceptance of new \nwithin more effective,  programs  through NGOs  role proposed by TA  \nresponsive, targeted, and  \u2022  NGOs and other civil       \u2022  Continued deepening \nsustainable poverty  society actors effectively  M&E systems expected to  of PRC civil society \nreduction programs  involved in government- embed elements developed   \nacross the People\u2019s  supported poverty  under the technical  Risk \nRepublic of China (PRC)  reduction work in at least  assistance (TA);

Under  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  Nongovernment  Organization-Government \nPartnerships in Village-Level Poverty Alleviation (footnote 5, main text), the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  supported  the  State  Council  Leading  Group  Office  of  Poverty  Alleviation  and \nDevelopment (LGOP), Jiangxi Province Poverty Alleviation and Development Office (PADO), \nand China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation (CFPA) in developing and successfully field-\ntesting viable methods for mainstreaming competitively selected nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) within the government\u2019s village poverty alleviation and development planning (VPADP) \nprogram.1 The TA\u2019s external monitoring and evaluation2 (M&E) clearly demonstrated that NGO-\ngovernment  cooperation  enhanced  (i)  the  breadth  and  depth  of  villager  participation,  thus \nimproving equity and efficacy while also empowering villagers; (ii) the extent to which the \nprocess and subprojects targeted the needs of the poor, women, and other marginalized groups; \n(iii) the transparency of fund use; and (iv) the likely sustainability of project interventions via \nincreased quality control (e.g., by including villagers\u2019 close oversight of construction) as well as \nvillagers\u2019 sense of ownership and acquisition of basic knowledge and skills.  \n \n2.  As noted in the main text, the new TA will support CFPA in implementing\u2014under LGOP \nand Jiangxi PADO oversight\u2014a second-generation pilot and support its feeding in to national \npolicy dialogue. It will help the government to more fully actualize the precepts of participatory, \nvillager-driven development set down in the China Poverty Alleviation and Development Outline \n(2001\u20132010)  and  promote  broader  national  objectives  of  harmonious,  people-centered \ndevelopment and the construction of a new socialist rurality3. The pilot test will build on work \nunder TA 4580-PRC and introduce three further innovations, thereby helping the government to \n(i) refine and pilot test improved modalities for NGO-government partnership within VPADP; (ii) \ndevelop mechanisms to mobilize other civil society actors (i.e., volunteers and corporate social \nresponsibility (CSR) actors) within national poverty reduction efforts; and (iii) develop a second \nwave of interventions to reinforce and enhance the sustainability of VPADP interventions by \nbolstering villager capacities. These will be operationalized and demonstrated through the two \nsub-pilots noted in the main text:   \n(i)  Starting in 2009 in eight villages, sub-pilot 1 will test an enhanced VPADP, \nserving as the first wave intervention and laying a foundation of village-level \ninfrastructure (contributing to economic and social outcomes) while building basic \nvillager capacities in participatory development. \n(ii)  Starting in 2009 in 10 former TA 4580-PRC villages, sub-pilot 2 will launch and \ntest a poverty reduction via villager development (PRVD) facility linked to a new \nsecond wave of interventions focused on such \u201csoftware\u201d as capacity building for \nvillagers and village-level organizations and support for grassroots innovations to \nreduce local poverty. The model will be iteratively developed, with an improved \nmodel replicated in the eight villages noted above4 and potentially others in 2010.    \n    \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Working \nclosely with local governments, NGOs in 16 pilot villages managed CNY500,000 of state VPADP funds and \nfacilitated villager-driven planning and participatory plan implementation. \n2  The TA 4580-PRC pilot test embedded an experimental design allowing external M&E to compare VPADP \nprocesses in villages using NGO-government cooperation against a government-only model in specified control \nvillages.   \n3  The latter refers to the government\u2019s drive in recent years to develop and modernize rural areas.  \n4  In coordination with continued implementation of NGO-facilitated VPADP interventions, these villages will, in 2010, \nintroduce second-wave PRVD initiatives developed during 2009 in the noted 10 former TA 4580-PRC villages.  \n ", "  Appendix 2       11 \n3.  LGOP has appointed CFPA to oversee the pilot test and act as implementing agency for \ncomponent 2 of the TA. The TA (as well as additional ADB staff and/or staff consultants) will \nassist CFPA in detailed design work and implementation of the planned two-pronged pilot test. \nIn addition to support from TA-funded consultants and resource persons, the TA will support \nCFPA in close stakeholder dialogue, networking, and partnership-building, particularly linked to \ndesign and launch of the PRVD facility under sub-pilot 2. The PRVD is foreseen to include an \nopen  charitable  fund,5  mobilizing  contributions  from  a  variety  of  civil  society  actors  (e.g., \ncharitable  foundations,  CSR  sponsors,  and  individual  sponsors)  to  support  village-level \ninitiatives.

The specialist will complete tasks including the following: \n                                                 \n6  This should include aspects such as a shift, where appropriate, in governments\u2019 roles (such as via outsourcing to \nNGOs) to focus on coordinating civil society participation, including budgeting, planning and guidance, supervision, \nand M&E for quality control. \n ", " 16  Appendix 3 \n(i)  Based on a review of the M&E systems developed under TA 4580-PRC and \nother programs (e.g., a Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit-supported \npoverty monitoring project in Jiangxi), propose to ADB the design for an external \nM&E  strategy  for  the  pilot  test.  The  design  should  include  a  baseline  and \nsubsequent surveys as well as detailed case study investigations to capture both \nquantitative and qualitative dimensions. It should utilize proxies and indicators for \nwhich accurate data can realistically be obtained, and it should capture both \nprocesses and outcomes under the sub-pilots. \n(ii)  Submit a detailed design for the baseline study to provide pre-pilot information on \nvillages foreseen for inclusion in both sub-pilots. This should incorporate key \nbaseline information requested by PADO and CFPA to ensure external M&E is \nconsistent with internal tracking of resource inputs and physical outputs. \n(iii)  Propose to ADB, mobilize, train, and supervise local survey collectors to support \nperiodic data collection and research assistants for data entry, etc. \n(iv)  Implement the baseline study and an agreed program of periodic7 M&E of project \nprocesses and outcomes.  \n(v)  Present draft midterm and final (see para. 6 below) M&E reports for review at the \nmulti-stakeholder midterm workshop and final forum, evaluating both processes \nand emerging impacts. \n(vi)  Develop an exit strategy for M&E to sustain post-TA tracking of the sub-pilots \nand support retention and potential replicability of M&E best practices developed \nunder the TA. The strategy should focus on a sustainable (if simplified) system, \nembedding  key  elements  of  the  TA\u2019s  M&E  strategy  and  aimed  at  capturing \nlonger-term  measures  of  impact  in  pilot  villages.  The  specialist  will  provide \nhands-on  capacity  building  to  PADO,  CFPA,  and  broader  stakeholders  (as \nappropriate) to ensure skill transfer. This will include face-to-face sessions and \ndevelopment of a self-contained toolkit of printed and computer-based tools.  \n(vii)  Provide recommendations for a broader framework for monitoring and evaluating \ncivil society participation in poverty reduction efforts, including guidelines for a \nmanagement information system that is minimalist (appropriate to priority needs \nand existing human resources) but has flexibility to adapt and expand. \n \n6.  The final process and impact evaluation report will be submitted for review by LGOP, \nPADO, CFPA, and ADB. It will then be finalized after presentation at the final policy forum. An \nM&E summary monograph will support incorporation of policy-relevant and objective evidence \nfrom M&E into the final policy report (component 1) and dissemination of key findings. This final \nM&E report and M&E summary monograph will include  \n(i)  key processes associated with the pilot test (e.g., capacity building, community \nengagement  facilitated  by  NGOs  and  volunteers,  equity  in  beneficiary \nparticipation and impacts, civil society actors\u2019 cooperation with village committees \nand local governments, stakeholder attitudes); \n(ii)  verified  and  emerging  impacts  in  reducing  poverty,  increasing  incomes, \nempowering communities, and other outcomes; and \n(iii)  challenges,  shortfalls  (e.g.,  remaining  capacity  gaps),  and  issues  affecting \nsustainability and replicability, as well as viable recommendations for actions by \nPRC government and civil society actors and (secondarily) international agencies \nand other external actors to address these.  \n \n                                                 \n7  The M&E strategy will indicatively involve biannual survey sweeps, with timing set taking into account seasonal \nfactors and the predicted timetable for sub-pilot implementation. \n ", "  Appendix 3  17\nB.  Resource Persons \n \n7.  ADB will additionally recruit short-term resource persons\u2014indicatively 50 working days \ntotal of national and 30 working days of international resource persons, each not exceeding 10 \nworking days\u2014to flexibly provide focused inputs for policy dialogue and advice to CFPA and \nADB on the pilot-test design.  \n \n8.  Inputs from national resource persons will be identified during work plan discussions at \nTA inception, the midterm review, and as needed. Indicatively, these will include review of key \ndraft reports and/or provision of specific written inputs (e.g., sub-reports), inputs to workshops, \ndeveloping materials for capacity building, and assistance to CFPA to draft detailed procedures \nand protocols for the pilot test.  \n \n9.  Indicatively, the TA will support three international resource persons (up to 10 working \ndays each), who will work closely with the national policy expert and CFPA. To support pilot-test \ndesign, the first two resource persons will prepare concise and focused input papers that distill \nkey  relevant  international  experience,  models,  and  mechanisms  for  (i)  NGO-government \npartnerships, and (ii) mobilization of corporate social responsibility and volunteerism. These \npapers will \n(i)  summarize and provide case studies on international lessons and best practice \nmodels, ranging from concrete operational, funding, and reporting mechanisms \nto broader institutional reforms to support civil society mobilization in poverty-\nrelated programs; \n(ii)  identify key civil society-government complementarities (based on comparative \nadvantage)  but  also  mismatches,  constraints  to  partnership,  and  options  for \nresolving these; and \n(iii)  include  an  annotated  bibliography  of  key  reference  materials  and  studies  to \nsupport more detailed investigation by the national policy expert. \n \nTowards TA completion, a third international resource person will support the policy expert in \ndeveloping recommendations on policy, institutional reform, and concrete modalities for the final \nreport. That person will also participate in the final forum. \n \n ", "18  Appendix 4            \n \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nA.
