During the 2003 Country Programming Mission, the Government of Indonesia requested \nproject preparatory technical assistance (TA) for the productivity enhancement for tree crops \nproject,  to  invigorate  the  smallholder  tree-crop  subsector  and  increase  the  incomes  of \nsmallholder tree-crop farmers, reduce poverty, and increase the contribution of tree crops to the \nnational economy. The Fact-Finding Mission visited Indonesia in July 2003 to develop the scope \nof work and implementation arrangements with the Government. The Mission held detailed \ndiscussions  with  the  National  Development  Planning  Agency  (BAPPENAS),  Ministry  of \nAgriculture (MOA), and Ministry of Finance (MOF), as well as other relevant agencies, on the \nrationale, objectives, scope, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and financing plan \nfor the TA. The Mission also met with representatives of the Food and Agriculture Organization \n(FAO)  and  other  external  funding  agencies,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and \nstakeholders to discuss the TA. It is in line with the Government's priorities and anticipated \ninitiatives, as well as with the strategic priorities of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in \nIndonesia. The TA is included in ADB's 2003 country strategy and program for Indonesia.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  About 24 million hectares (ha), 19% of Indonesia\u2019s land area, is under agriculture. Of \nthis, estate crops\u2014including rubber, oil palm, coconut, cocoa, coffee, tea, sugar cane, cotton, \ntobacco, cloves, pepper, and other minor crops\u2014are grown on almost 15 million ha and provide \na substantial portion of income to more than 13 million households. Estate crops account for \nabout 50% of agricultural export earnings and 18% of non-oil exports. In 2002 estate crops \ngenerated foreign exchange earnings of more than $3 billion. Indonesia is the second largest \nproducer of rubber after Thailand, and of oil palm after Malaysia. \n \n3.  Over  the  last  25  years  public  and  private  investment  in  smallholder  tree-crop2 \ndevelopment has been high. The Government has borrowed $3.2 billion from external sources \nand mobilized an equivalent level of domestic resources in the sector, much of which has \nsupported smallholder development and created substantial income-generating assets for small \nfarmers in the form of trees. Investment has also been large in associated processing facilities \nand in a wide variety of up- and downstream activities that have created many jobs and \ncontribute substantially to household incomes, the national economy, and exports.  \n \n4.  Since 1985 ADB has provided 18 loans amounting to $935 million to the tree-crop \nsector. Many ADB-financed projects in the environment, forestry, and natural resources sectors \nhave  included  components  to  reduce  rural  poverty  and  enhance  income.  Other  external \nagencies funding tree-crop sector projects include the World Bank, International Fund for \nAgricultural Development, and Japan Bank for International Cooperation. A recent sector study3 \nand project completion report4 concluded that investments have, for the most part, substantially \nincreased the incomes and well-being of smallholders, providing secure incomes, lifting families \nout of poverty, and securing livelihoods for several decades to come. However, productivity in \nthe smallholder tree-crop sector remains well below potential, compared not only with research \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 31 July 2003. \n2  Tree crops are a subsector of the estate-crop sector, and refer to perennial crops. The term smallholder refers to \nsmall tree crop farmers, with holdings of 1-5 ha, which account for 90% of the total area under tree crops. \n3  ADB. 1999.  Technical Assistance to the Republic of Indonesia for Sustainable Management Systems for Tree \nCrops. Manila (TA No. 3384-INO, initiated April 2001, ongoing). \n4  ADB. 1991. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nRepublic of Indonesia for the Tree Crop Smallholder Project. Manila (Loan No. 1118-INO, implemented March \n1992\u2013March 2001). \n ", "2      \n     \n     \nstation  results,  but  also  with  the  performance  of  neighboring  countries.  For  example,  the \nsmallholder yield of rubber is 0.65 ton (t)/ha, compared to 1.50\u20132.00 t/ha in Thailand. For palm \noil, smallholder yield is 2.5 t crude palm oil (cpo)/ha, compared to 6.0 t cpo/ha in Malaysia. Apart \nfrom low productivity, many tree-crop products suffer from low quality and inefficient processing \nand marketing. Products such as coffee and cocoa also face export restrictions due to sanitary \nand disease factors, which further reduce the farm-gate price. The main factors causing low \nproductivity  of  smallholder  tree  crops  are  old  age  of  trees  (rubber,  coconut,  coffee,  tea); \ngenetically low-yielding planting materials (rubber, coconut, coffee, cashew, tea); low use of \ninputs; and poor crop maintenance. \n \n5.  Past assistance has focused on physical development of plantations, infrastructure, and \nprocessing facilities rather than building institutional capacity and empowering farmers. Lessons \nlearned indicate that mallholders do not readily adopt new technologies and lack information on \nall aspects of production, processing, and marketing. Limited human resources and facilities, \nexacerbated  under  decentralization,  constrain  extension  services  to  smallholders. \nDissemination of research findings and transfer of technology should be improved to encourage \nfarmers to adopt new technologies, especially to improve and distribute planting materials to \nassure higher productivity. Older trees should be replanted, and smallholders helped to adopt \nand  implement  new  technologies,  improve  cultural  practices,  and  enhance  marketing \nopportunities.  Markets  should  be  allowed  to  function  freely,  and  the  interaction  among \ngovernment, the private sector, and smallholders should be strengthened.  \n \n6.  Since 2002 the Directorate General of Estate Crops and Production (DGECP) has been \npromoting  a  \u201cnew  paradigm,\u201d  establishing  Tree-Crop  Industry  Stakeholder  Development \nProgram (KIMBUN)5 areas to bring the benefits of downstream development to smallholder \nfarmers.  The  pilot-scale  Farmer  Empowerment  Program,  developed  under  the  TA  for \nSustainable Management Systems for Tree Crops (see footnote 3) supports institution building \nof public sector institutions that help smallholders, focusing on developing viable, self-help \ncommunity-based organizations of smallholder farmers to interface with regional government \nagencies and the private sector. MOA recently adopted this model for its farmer empowerment \nprograms. The TA sector study proposes a major, continuing role for the Government in \ndeveloping smallholder tree crops. Production, exports, and tax revenue must be increased; \npoverty reduced in a sustainable manner; and rural economies made less vulnerable to shocks. \nSustainable mechanisms must be encouraged to finance research, promotion, and replanting. \nThe Government\u2019s core functions are facilitator, stimulator, and regulator, although success will \nrequire a change in the way government institutions operate and allocate budgets, taking \naccount  of  devolution  of  responsibilities  to  the  regions.  While  the  smallholder  credit \nrequirements should be met by the domestic financial institutions, public sector investments will \nstill be required for infrastructure and technology development, and capacity building. \n \n7.  ADB  assistance  to  rural  development  is  increasingly  concentrating  on  the  poorest \nregions  to  help  strengthen  regional  government  capacities  to  aid  agricultural  and  rural \ndevelopment. An ADB-financed agriculture and rural development strategy study6 that started in \nJune 2003 to review domestic policies and study the responses to the international trade policy \nenvironment  in  the  agricultural  sector  will  support  TA  preparation  and  implementation. \nContinued public sector investment is considered important to restructure support services for \nthe  smallholder  sector  under  decentralization;  finance  replanting  of  aging  trees;  promote \n                                                 \n5  Includes  strengthening  farmer  institutions;  empowerment  and  training;  productivity  improvement,  including \nextensification, rehabilitation, intensification, and diversification, and intermediate activities such as processing, \ndistribution, and marketing; and improving farmers\u2019 associations. \n6  ADB. 2002.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to prepare an investment project with the primary goals of \nincreasing the contribution of tree crops to the national economy and reducing poverty of \nsmallholders by increasing their incomes. The TA study will (i) identify and analyze sectoral \nissues and constraints; (ii) identify alternative intervention options; (iii) provide information to \ncompare  and  choose  among  options,  assessing  their  likely  impacts;  and  (iv)  prepare  an \ninvestment project. \n \n9.  The investment project will aim to increase the incomes of smallholder tree-crop farmers \nand to remove constraints on tree-crop subsector productivity. The project will improve support \nand  regulatory  services,  targeting  the  poor,  through  district-level  interventions.  Specific \nobjectives  include  (i)  restructuring  of  support  services  for  the  smallholder  subsector;  (ii) \npromotion of diversified and sustainable farming systems among small tree-crop farmers; and \n(iii) provision of infrastructure to encourage the development of integrated tree-crop production, \nmarketing,  processing,  and  manufacturing,  through  private  sector  investment,  state-owned \nenterprises, and cooperatives.  \n \n10.  Specific TA outputs will (i) prepare an investment project to achieve the stated objectives \nconsistent with Ministerial Decree (KEPMEN) 35/2003 and other regulations relevant to fund \nchanneling, (ii) prepare districts (particularly local government agencies and local parliaments) \nand communities to participate in the investment project, and (iii) establish nurseries to provide \nreplanting materials. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n11.  The  investment  project  will  focus  on  perennial  tree  crops.  Historically,  ADB  has \nsupported rubber, oil palm, cashews, cocoa, coconut, tea, and coffee, and this project will aim to \nenhance the productivity of previous investments. The Government has requested expansion of \nthe range of crops to include pepper and other tree crops. The project will take a farming \nsystems  approach7  rather  than  a  commodity-based  approach  to  identify  appropriate \ninterventions, recognizing that the technology and opportunities are different for each tree crop \nand location. For example, replanting is important for rubber and coconut; rehabilitation for \ncoffee and tea; and intensification for oil palm, cocoa, cashew, and pepper. Income-enhancing \nactivities such as intercropping during replanting and diversification will be analyzed. \n \n12.  During the TA\u2019s inception stage, target districts will be identified using a geographic \ninformation system-based analysis of data on poverty, existence and distribution of smallholder \ntree crops, ethnic representation, fiscal condition of the districts, and consideration of ADB\u2019s \ngeographic focus. Approximately 30 districts are expected to be included under the project, \ndistributed in four of the major island groups. \n \n                                                 \n7  A farming systems approach considers the whole farm rather than individual elements, recognizing that the system \nis driven as much by the overall welfare of farming households as by yield and profitability. The approach also \nrecognizes the influence of the external environmental and political, economic, institutional, and social factors. \n   ", "4      \n     \n     \n13.  The next phase of the TA will review policy, legislation, regulations, and lessons learned. \nStudies will assess: (i) constraints on and opportunities for production, processing, marketing, \nand infrastructure; (ii) farmer empowerment needs; and (iii) skills, financial capacity, training, \nand staffing needs of regional administrations and NGOs to provide services for tree-crop \nfarmers. Studies will also identify mechanisms to finance research, promotion, and replanting; \nassess working and investment capital requirements of smallholders and identify options and \nsources of credit; propose selection criteria and processes for inclusion of smallholders; and \nidentify target farmer groups.  \n \n14.  The final stage of the TA will prepare a detailed plan of activities, including costs and \nimplementation  arrangements,  for  each  district  in  consultation  with  district  government \nagencies, and prepare a detailed feasibility study for the investment project. \n \n15.  The feasibility study will consider the many complex and diverse issues that affect the \ntree-crop sector: (i) economic factors such as (a) overall industry structure and functioning; (b) \nfarm  household  and  estate  worker  resources  and  livelihoods;  (c)  changing  domestic  and \ninternational prices and behavioral responses of producers, processors, traders, and buyers; \nand  (d)  public  and  market-related  institutions;  (ii)  industry  and  government  incentives  to \nencourage smallholders to invest in tree crops, recognizing their long gestation period; (iii) \nmechanisms  to  fund  commodity  research,  promotion,  and  replanting;  (iv)  improvement  of \ncollection, processing, and marketing efficiency; and (v) the role of the private sector and \ncommodity associations in improving commodity performance. \n \n16.  Districts will help prepare the project through regional-  and  district-level workshops \ninvolving  district  government  agencies  and  local  communities.  Local  stakeholders  will  be \nconsulted throughout the process, aiming to result in a letter of commitment by the district \ngovernment to participate in the project, provide counterpart budgets, and comply with national \ngovernment  financing  requirements.  To  prepare  for  early  implementation  of  replanting \nprograms, the TA will also establish nurseries in strategic locations to form the basis for \ndistributing improved planting material. A project framework for the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.443 million equivalent, of which $483,000 is \nthe foreign exchange cost and $960,000 equivalent the local currency cost. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $800,000 equivalent, consisting of $338,000 in foreign exchange \ncosts and $462,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Investment \nCentre of FAO (FAO-IC) will finance $343,000 equivalent on a grant basis.8 The Government \nwill finance the remaining $300,000 equivalent of the local currency costs, and has assured the \navailability of counterpart services and facilities by the expected commencement date of the TA. \nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. The Government has been advised that approval of \nthe TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The DGECP of MOA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. DGECP will work in close \ncooperation with MOA\u2019s Directorates of Agricultural Facilities (DGAF) and Agricultural Product \n                                                 \n8  Cost-sharing arrangements are 70% ADB and 30% FAO, as outlined in the memorandum of understanding \nbetween ADB and FAO, 4 August 1981 (Doc. R77-81), and amended on 22 March 2001. FAO-IC will administer its \nown funds and bill ADB for its portion, plus 10% administrative expense on remuneration. \n   ", "  5\nProcessing and Marketing Development (DGAPPMD), MOF, and BAPPENAS. DGECP will \nappoint a project manager and appropriate counterparts for day-to-day TA coordination under \nthe direct supervision of the director general of DGECP. Its counterparts will work closely with \nthe  consultants  and  be  responsible  for  liaison  with  regional  governments  in  each  target \nprovince, especially provision of local counterparts and arrangement of field trips. DGECP will \nprovide office accommodation and logistical support for the TA study, and adequate budgetary \nsupport for staff travel and per diem. DGECP will coordinate and collaborate with external \nagencies and stakeholders, including national and international forestry and tree-crop research \ninstitutions, industry associations, and NGOs. The TA will be implemented in a fully participatory \nmanner, including by holding stakeholder workshops to discuss the approach with key central, \nprovincial and district agencies; target communities (including ethnic groups); external agencies; \nNGOs; research organizations; and other stakeholders The summary initial poverty and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 3. \n \n19.  A TA steering committee (TASC), chaired by a senior officer in DGECP, and comprising \nsenior representatives from BAPPENAS, DGAF, DGAPPMD, MOF, and other relevant agencies \nand stakeholders, will be established and meet monthly to review the progress, and guide TA \ndirection and outputs, including selection of target districts. TASC will invite stakeholder inputs \nby involving key individuals, NGOs, and associations representing indigenous peoples, target \ndistricts, and the private sector.  \n \n20.  ADB and FAO-IC will implement the TA in accordance with the long-standing working \narrangements between FAO and ADB (see footnote 8). FAO-IC has an institutional advantage \nand is well qualified through its wide experience in preparing development projects, worldwide \nexpertise in agriculture, and, particularly, ongoing implementation of the TA for Sustainable \nManagement Systems for Tree Crops (footnote 3).  Consultants or experts hired by FAO-IC will \nbe  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  or  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Participation of \nFAO-IC staff and consultants will be subject to technical clearance by ADB. Goods will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, for handover to DGECP on TA \ncompletion. \n \n21.  The  TA  consulting  team  will  comprise  7  international  and  12  domestic  specialists. \nExpertise will be required in tree-crop agronomy and research, economics, finance and credit, \ncommunity development, international trade and marketing, industry and processing, policy and \ninstitutions, environment, infrastructure, land titling, monitoring and evaluation, and geographic \nand management information systems. In total, 102 person-months (21 international and 81 \ndomestic) input will be required. The FAO-IC team leader will work full-time in Indonesia for the \nduration of the TA study. The outline terms of reference for the TA and person-months of \nspecialist inputs are in Appendix 4. \n \n22.  The TA is expected to commence in January 2004 and be completed in September \n2004. An inception report will be prepared in the 6th week, an interim report in the 20th week, \nand a draft final report in the 34th week. Tripartite meetings between the Government, FAO-IC, \nand ADB will be held within 2 weeks of submission of the reports to discuss the findings. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Indonesia  for  preparing  the  Productivity  Enhancement  for  Tree  Crops \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n   ", "6 Appendix 1     \n     \n     \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nProject Goal   (To be refined during TA)  (To be refined during TA)   \nIncrease the contribution of   Improved levels of   Monitoring of local and  Existence of appropriate \ntree crops to the national  production and quality of  national price, trade, and  government policies and \neconomy  products from the  production data  regulations to support \n  smallholder tree-crop    smallholder farmers, and \n  subsector     effective implementation \n       \nReduce poverty by  Increased smallholder  National, regional, and local  Continued and consistent \nincreasing farmers\u2019 incomes  farmers\u2019 incomes  socioeconomic surveys and  commitment of government \n    data  to poverty reduction, and for \n  farmers through appropriate \npolicy and services, \nincluding credit \n \nGood governance and \neffective decentralization \nProject Purpose   (To be refined during TA)  (To be refined during TA)   \nIncrease the incomes of   Increased income of   Monitoring of household  Willingness of smallholder \nsmallholder tree-crop  smallholder farmers,  incomes of smallholder tree- farmers and districts to \nfarmers   indicating reduced poverty in  crop farmers  support and participate in \n  target districts    project \n       \n       \nRemove constraints on tree- Measures of productivity,  Monitoring of data, inputs,  Effective technologies and \ncrop subsector productivity  quality, and price of  marketing information, local  information available to \ncommodities at district and  government funding and  smallholder farmers \nnational levels  staffing, nongovernment   \n  organization (NGO) activity,   \nMeasures of inputs,  and existence of supporting  Effective implementation of \nservices, infrastructure, and  policy and regulations at  local and national policies \ninstitutional arrangements to  district and provincial level  and regulations conducive to \nsupport smallholder tree- enhancement of smallholder \ncrop farmers   farmer production and \n  incomes \nTechnical Assistance (TA)       \nOutputs   Preparation of TA inception,     \nPrepare an investment  interim, and final reports  Regular  TA Steering  Timely TASC meetings, and \nproject to achieve the stated    Committee (TASC) meetings  TA supervision missions \nobjectives in accordance  Identification of financing or   \nwith Ministerial Decree  cofinancing for project  TA inception, interim, and \n(KEPMEN) 35/2003 and  implementation  final tripartite meetings;

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in country  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty  \npoverty analysis? YES  partnership agreement? YES \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \nPoverty is high in rural Indonesia, where an estimated 20.2% of the population lives below the poverty line, \ncompared with 15.1% in urban areas (1999). Many communities, particularly smallholder tree-crop farmers, are \nincluded in this category. The project goals are to increase the contribution of tree crops to the national economy \nand to reduce poverty levels by increasing farmer incomes. The project purposes are to increase the incomes of \nsmallholder tree-crop farmers and to remove constraints on tree-crop subsector productivity by promoting \nincreased on-farm productivity and improving farm incomes, and facilitating the marketing of tree-crop commodities \nby smallholder farmers. The project will empower farmers and make institutional arrangements for government and \nnongovernment support to smallholder tree-crop farmers.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: Poverty Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nDuring the initial phase of the project preparatory technical assistance (TA), the consultants will compile data on \npoverty and smallholder tree crops throughout Indonesia, using geographic information system mapping techniques \nto link the information for use in selecting target provinces, districts, and communities, and to provide a baseline \ndatabase for subsequent project monitoring. The consultants will also review and document ongoing and completed \ntree-crop projects to identify successful schemes, and then identify needs and interventions to prepare the investment \nproject. \n \nA poverty and social analysis will be undertaken to estimate the expected impact of project interventions on poor \ncommunities, other stakeholders (including intermediaries and nongovernment organizations, and national and local \ngovernments. The analysis will examine the distribution of project costs and benefits, in financial and economic \nterms, allocated to various stakeholders, assess the social impact, and estimate the distribution of project effects to \nthe poor to determine the poverty impact, as outlined in ADB\u2019s Handbook for Integrating Poverty Impact Assessment \nin the Economic Analysis of Projects and ADB\u2019s Handbook on Poverty and Social Analysis. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nStakeholder analysis: During the review of ongoing and completed tree-crop projects, and preparation of districts to \nparticipate in the project, the consultants will identify and consult with a cross-section of stakeholders to determine \ntheir roles, functions, and needs and to understand supply chains to markets for tree-crop commodities. The outcome \nof this analysis will form the basis to identify mechanisms and interventions for target districts to be included under \nthe project.  \n \nParticipation strategy required: The TA will be implemented in a fully participatory manner, and the consultants will \norganize participatory stakeholder workshops during TA implementation at the national, island-group, and district \nlevels to discuss the approach and findings with key central, provincial, and district agencies; representatives of \ntarget communities; external agencies; NGOs; research organizations; and other interested parties. The TA will \nprepare districts (particularly local administrations and local parliaments) to participate in the investment project in \naccordance with Ministerial Decree (KEPMEN) 35/2003. \nD.

General \n \n1.  The TA consulting team, to be assembled by the Investment Centre of the Food and \nAgricultural Organization (FAO-IC), consisting of 7 international and 12 domestic consultants, \nwill  work  in  close  collaboration  with  the  Directorate  General  of  Estate  Crops  Production \n(DGECP) of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The team will also work with other directorates \nwithin MOA, Ministry of Finance, National Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) and other national \nagencies, and with provincial and district governments and agencies in target areas, to prepare \nthe investment project. \n \n2.  The TA will be implemented in a fully participatory manner, involving all agencies and \nbeneficiaries.  The  TA  team  will  organize  one  national  workshop  and  several  subsequent \nregional workshops to discuss the approach and options for the design of the project with key \nnational, provincial, and district agencies. These workshops will also allow representatives of \ntarget  communities,  external  and  nongovernmental  agencies,  and  research  and  industry \norganizations to help design and prepare the project. The team will also organize a final \nworkshop to disseminate the TA recommendations and reach an agreement on all aspects of \nthe project with the agencies involved in its implementation. \n \n3.  The TA inception phase will concentrate on preparing an overview of smallholder tree-\ncrop production and poverty, establishing selection criteria, and selecting districts to be included \nin the project. Then detailed preparation of project activities for each district will begin. The \ninterim phase will determine and reach agreement on the policy and long-term objectives of \nnational and local government assistance to smallholder tree-crop farmers. During the final \nphase,  detailed  district-level  preparation  and  analysis  will  be  completed  for  each  district, \nincluding  letters  of  commitment  from  district  governments  to  participate  in  the  project. \nStakeholders will be prepared and trained to implement of the project. National project activities \nwill also be identified. A feasibility report for the project will be prepared in a format suitable for \nappraisal  of  the  project  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB), containing the required \nanalyses and assessments.  \n \n4.  Following each TA phase, a report will be prepared for discussion at tripartite meetings \nbetween the Government, FAO-IC, and ADB. An inception report will be prepared in the 6th \nweek, an interim report in the 20th week, and a draft final report in the 34th week. Tripartite \nmeetings will be held within 2 weeks of submission of the reports to discuss the findings. The \nTA team will submit 10 printed copies of the inception, interim, and draft final reports, and 20 \nprinted copies of the final report. The executive summary of each report will be prepared in \nBahasa Indonesia and an electronic copy of the full report on compact disc (CD-ROM) will be \nprovided to each participating province and district.  \n \nB.
