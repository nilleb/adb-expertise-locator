The capacity development technical assistance (TA) is included in the 2013 nonlending \nassistance pipeline  of the  approved  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  country  operations \nbusiness plan, 2013\u20132015 as Capacity Building for New Energy City Demonstration in Hebei.1 \nThe concept paper was approved on 4 November 2013.  \n \n2.  During the TA fact-finding mission, the TA title was changed to Strengthening Capacity \nfor Promoting Distributed Renewable Energy Utilization in Hebei Province to better reflect the \nscope  of  the  TA,  the  impact  and  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost \nestimates, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference as agreed with the Hebei provincial government \nand the Ministry of Finance.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In recognition of the climate change impacts and local environmental problems caused \nby increasing use of fossil-fuel-based energy sources in the PRC, the central government has \ninitiated several measures to reduce the energy intensity of the economy and to pare back the \npredominance of coal in energy supply. To meet the challenges posed by the rapid rise in \nenergy consumption and associated emissions, the government is committed to achieve 40%\u2013\n45% carbon intensity reduction by 2020, compared with the 2005 level. 4 The government also \nset specific targets to (i) reduce energy intensity by 20% in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan, 2006\u2013\n2010 and by 16% in the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015; (ii) reduce carbon intensity by 17% \nduring the 12th plan; and (iii) increase the renewable energy contribution in the primary energy \nsupply to 15% by 2020, from 8.9% in 2010.  \n \n4.  As a result of these policy measures, the PRC has emerged as the leading producer of \nwind power in the world with a grid-connected capacity of over 62 gigawatts (GW) by 2012. The \nrapid development of large-scale and centralized solar photovoltaic and wind power capacity is \nposing new challenges to grid stability due to the intermittent nature of power supplied by these \nplants. Furthermore, environmental and grid stability concerns have sparked increased interest \nin small-scale, \u201cdistributed\u201d sources of renewable electricity generation, such as building  \nintegrated solar photovoltaic and waste- and biomass-based electricity generation. 5 \n  \n5.  In contrast to the rapid deployment of renewable energy technologies for electricity \ngeneration,  the  PRC  has  so  far  not  widely  applied  renewable  energy  to  heat  production. \nAlthough the PRC is the world\u2019s largest market for solar water heating, the concentrated solar \nthermal  technology  is  not  widely  deployed  for  heating  applications.  There  is  also  a  large \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2013. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2013\u20132015. Manila.   \n2  The TA fact-finding mission was held on 13\u201314 November 2013. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 November 2013. \n4  Carbon intensity is defined as amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of gross domestic product. National \nEnergy Administration. 2011. Report on PRC\u2019s Energy Development for 2011. Beijing: Economic Science Press.  \n5  \u201cDistributed\u201d renewable energy systems generate clean, renewable electricity on-site, i.e., where that energy will be \nused. The term distinguishes these systems from the large, centralized power plants that provide the vast majority \nof the nation\u2019s power. Distributed renewable energy systems can take many forms, including geothermal systems, \nmicro-hydroelectric systems, solar panels, and wind turbines. There are many programs and policies that can \neither help or hinder the adoption and integration of distributed energy systems. \n ", "2 \npotential for using biomass and municipal solid waste to produce electricity and heat, especially \nin urban areas. Geothermal energy for space heating has large untapped potential to replace \nthe coal boilers in urban areas of the northern PRC, such as Hebei province where coal is the \nfuel of choice for heating.  \n \n6.  Hebei  Province,  which  borders  the  Beijing  and  Tianjin  municipalities,  ranks  second \namong  the  PRC  Provinces  in  overall  energy  consumption.  The  energy  intensity  of  the \nprovince\u2014at 1.583 tons of coal equivalent per CNY10,000 in 2010\u2014is 1.5 times the national \naverage. Moreover, coal contributes 90.5% of primary energy supply in Hebei Province, against \nthe corresponding national figure of 68%. Given the highly energy-intensive nature of Hebei's \neconomic structure, the provincial government has taken concerted efforts to improve energy \nefficiency and increase renewable energy penetration in its primary energy mix. \n \n7.  The energy consumed for space heating contributed to 7.3% of the final energy demand \nin Hebei Province. Its centralized heating systems covered about 580 million square meters (m2) \nin 2012, and this is expected to increase to 780 million m2 by 2020. Coal-fired combined heat \nand power plants meet the heat demand of 250 million m2 in the larger cities in the province, \nwhile heat-only boilers are supplying 330 million m2 in county-level cities. In addition, natural gas \nis used for providing heating to 20 million m2 in neighboring areas of Beijing municipality. \nAlthough Hebei has both shallow-ground (i.e., less than 200 meters below the ground level) and \ndeep-ground geothermal resources, the utilization of geothermal energy for space heating is \nlimited to 2 million m2 at present.     \n \n8.  The increasing concern about air pollution in Beijing has prompted the government to \nboost the use of natural gas for power generation and heat production in Hebei Province, as \ncoal burning in Hebei is found to be one of the major contributors to air pollution in Beijing. \nThere is scope to further reduce carbon emissions and air pollutants by complementing natural-\ngas-based combined heating with renewable energy technologies such as wind-based electric \nheating, shallow-ground geothermal energy, and waste-to-energy conversion. In addition, the \ndistributed renewable energy sources can also be used for electricity generation subject to \navailability of adequate feed-in tariffs and grid connectivity.  \n \n9.  Hebei has emerged as one of the leading wind power basins in the PRC and a major \nmanufacturing base of solar photovoltaic panels, but renewable energy is not widely used for \nmeeting  the  non-electricity  energy  needs  of  urban  areas.  There  is  significant  potential  for \nincreasing  the  use  of  renewable  energy  in  urban  areas  for  residential  and  commercial \napplications, including heating. The installed wind power capacity in Hebei is more than 7.5 GW \nand wind power curtailment is prevalent due to excess wind power generation over and above \nthe wind power absorption capacity of the transmission grid.6 This excess wind energy is not \nutilized for local application such as space heating in large wind-power-producing counties in \nZhangjiakou and Chengde prefectures of Hebei Province.      \n \n10.  There  is  lack  of  understanding  of  the  availability  of  geothermal  resources  in  close \nproximity to population centers, technical and financial viability of geothermal energy as a heat \n                                                 \n6  Absorption of power generated by solar photovoltaic and wind power plants into the grid requires more grid \nflexibility to fully utilize the variable and intermittent output from these plants. In addition, the PRC\u2019s interregional \npower market is relatively underdeveloped, inhibiting trade of electricity between regional power grids. In certain \nregions of the PRC this resulted in the curtailment of wind power, which is as high as 40% compared with less than \n5% in the United States. \n \n ", "3 \nsource, and use of geothermal energy for heating in combination with heat pumps and natural \ngas backup. In addition, developing geothermal energy for productive use requires multiple \nregulatory approvals. Similarly, municipal and agricultural waste is not widely used for electricity \ngeneration and heat production due to lack of clarity on institutional responsibilities and financial \nincentives.  Innovative  technologies  such  as  plasma  combustion  and  gasification  can  be \ndeployed to produce heat and electricity in an environmentally sustainable manner in urban \nareas.   \n \n11.  Small-scale  distributed  renewable  energy  investments  in  both  electricity  and  heat \nproduction are appropriate for private sector investments. However, it would also be necessary \nto structure public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) to boost private sector interest in these projects, \ntaking into account the specific risk profiles of different renewable technologies. The provincial \ngovernment agencies in Hebei need to develop their capacity to structure PPP transactions and \nto provide technology-specific financial incentives that will attract private investors to these \nprojects.  \n \n12.  The integration of distributed energy sources based on a range of renewable energy \ntechnologies  for  heat  and  electricity  production  poses  various  technical,  institutional,  and \nfinancial  challenges  for  provincial  authorities.  The  investment  models  to  be  adopted  for \nmobilizing investments in large number of relatively small renewable energy projects would be \nradically different from the state-owned-enterprise-led approach deployed in developing large-\nscale power plants, including wind power, in the PRC. It would also be necessary to create an \nenabling  environment  through  appropriate  policy  incentives  such  as  transparent  regulatory \nregime, feed-in tariffs, and tax incentives to attract investments in distributed renewable energy \nprojects.    \n \n13.  The utilization of the renewable energy for non-electricity applications such as heating has \nnot been widely deployed in Hebei Province as well as in other provinces in the PRC.  Although \nthere is good potential for increasing the renewable energy in heat supply, there are institutional, \ntechnical and capacity issues that are preventing the increased use of renewable energy for \nnon-electricity applications  in Hebei Province.  The proposed TA is designed to address these \nbarriers.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n14.  The TA will support the central government\u2019s strategy to de-link economic growth and \ngreenhouse gas emissions and to increase the use of renewable energy. The TA is also a \ntimely response to the urban air pollution in northern PRC and will support the regulations \nissued by the National Energy Administration in 2013 to increase nonpolluting energy sources \nfor heat supply. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 also prioritized ADB support for \ninnovative technologies and institutional arrangements to mitigate climate change and protect \nthe  urban  environment,  and  to  promote  private  sector  participation  in  delivery  of  public \nservices.7 The TA will strengthen the capacity of provincial government agencies for using \ndistributed renewable energy for heat supply in urban areas by assessing the feasibility of \ngeothermal energy and wind power as a potential heat source in the context of Hebei Province. \nIn addition, the TA will provide capacity building to provincial agencies to structure PPPs to \nattract private sector investments to these distributed renewable energy projects.  \n \n                                                 \n7 ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2011\u20132015. Manila \n ", "4 \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the TA will be greater use of distributed renewable energy in Hebei \nProvince. The outcome of the TA will be stronger capacity of the government agencies in Hebei \nProvince to promote the use of distributed renewable energy.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The  TA  will  be  undertaken  in  close  collaboration  with  Hebei  provincial  government \nagencies responsible for promoting the use of renewable energy for heat supply. The TA \nconsultants will work closely with these agencies to confirm the availability of renewable energy \nresources  such  as  excess  wind  energy,  biomass,  municipal  solid  waste,  and  geothermal \nenergy, and to ascertain the feasibility of using these resources to meet the energy needs of \nurban centers in the province. In addition, demonstration projects deploying these technologies \nwill be selected and institutional arrangements to implement these projects as PPPs will be \nproposed. The TA will have the following outputs:  \n(i)   The geothermal resource availability in secondary cities in Hebei Province and \nthe feasibility of using geothermal energy for heat supply are assessed. \n(ii)   The technical and financial feasibility of using excess wind energy and biomass \nfor heat supply in Hebei Province is confirmed. \n(iii)   Several distributed renewable energy projects are selected for implementation, \nand  the  capacity  of  provincial  government  agencies  to  promote  PPPs  to \nimplement these projects is strengthened. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $400,000 equivalent, of which $300,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The \ngovernment will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, facilities and \nremuneration of counterpart staff, studies, reports, data, and other in-kind contributions. The \ncost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  The Hebei provincial government will be the executing agency for the TA. The Demand \nSide Management Center under the Hebei Development and Reform Commission will be the \nimplementing agency. The implementing agency will maintain close coordination with the Hebei \nBureau for Energy and the Hebei Bureau of Housing and Urban Development.   \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months, from 1 January 2014 to 31 December \n2014. It will be carried out by a team of national consultants with extensive knowledge and \nexpertise  in  (i)  geothermal  resource  assessment  and  geothermal  power  development  for \nheating,  (ii)  distributed  renewable  energy  technologies  and  implementation  models  for \ndistributed renewable energy projects, (iii) structuring of PPP projects for renewable energy, and \n(iv) institutional and financial regulations pertaining to wind power and heat supply in the PRC.   \n \n20.  ADB will recruit consultants through a national consulting firm in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time) using the quality- \nand cost-based selection method. Because of the importance of the technical aspects of the \nconsulting services, a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20 is proposed. Interested consulting firms will be \nrequired to submit a simplified technical proposal covering work plan, team composition, task \n ", "5 \nassignments, work and personnel schedules, and curriculum vitae of the proposed consultants. \nThe  national  consultancy  firms  in  the  PRC  have  adequate  expertise  to  undertake  this \nassignment, and the relatively small TA budget and the requirement for extensive fieldwork do \nnot warrant the inclusion of international firms in the short list. Furthermore, the local knowledge \nis important for developing distributed renewable energy projects.  \n \n21.  All procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2013, as amended from time to time). All equipment purchased under the TA will be turned \nover to the implementing agency after TA completion. TA funds will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \n \n22.  The consultants will be required to maintain a close working relationship with ADB and the \nexecuting and implementing agencies. Tripartite meetings between ADB, the executing and \nimplementing agencies, and consultants will be conducted at the TA inception, midterm, and \nupon submission of the draft final report to provide guidance to the consultants and to review \ntheir reports. Workshops and seminars will be held to collect comments and discuss consultants\u2019 \nreports. The TA\u2019s main findings will be largely disseminated.   \n \nIV.
