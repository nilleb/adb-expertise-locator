The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested that the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) provide technical assistance (TA) to the Ministry of Railways (MOR) \nto support policy reform related to accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). A Fact-\nFinding Mission visited the PRC in December 2003, and reached an understanding with the \nGovernment on the TA\u2019s objectives, scope, terms of reference, cost estimates, financing plan, \nand implementation arrangements. The TA is included in the ADB 2004 country program for the \nPRC.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Economic growth in the PRC was rapid over the past two decades, reaching 9.1% in \n2003. The rapid economic growth has resulted in a 9.2% annual growth in passenger transport \nand a 7.1% growth in freight transport from1978 to 2002. During that period, railway freight grew \nfrom 35 billion tons/kilometer (km) to 1,552 billion tons/km, equivalent to an annual growth rate \nof 4.4%, and passenger traffic grew at 6.6% annually. Despite this growth in traffic, the railway \nlost modal share for both freight and passengers. By late 2002, the PRC\u2019s railway system \ncomprised 72,000 route-km, and carried about a third of the PRC\u2019s freight and passenger traffic.  \n \n3.  The Government\u2019s railway development policy focuses on (i) removing constraints and \nexpanding the railway system, (ii) encouraging construction of joint venture local railways to \npromote the development of local economies, (iii) improving the railway system\u2019s efficiency by \nusing new technology and modern management tools for planning and operations, (iv) reducing \noperating subsidies through appropriate pricing and commercialization of services, (v) initiating \ninstitutional  and  structural  reforms  to  increase  MOR\u2019s  autonomy  and  accountability,  and  \n(vi) encouraging nongovernment investment in infrastructure and related services.  \n \n4.  The  Tenth  Five-Year  Plan  (2001\u20132005)  identifies  transportation,  including  railway \ndevelopment, as a priority. The plan envisages (i) building 6,000 km of new lines to access \npreviously unserved areas, with the network reaching 74,000 km; (ii) providing 3,000 km of \ndouble lines, and electrifying 5,000 km of key lines to increase capacity; and (iii) increasing \noperating speeds on 5,000 km, with the total length of such lines reaching 15,000 km. The plan \nfor the railway sector includes an investment of CNY350 billion, including CNY270 billion for \ncapital  construction  and  CNY80  billion  for  rolling  stock.  To  complement  expansion  of  that \ncapacity, the Government has emphasized the need to accelerate reforms in the railway sector.  \n  \n5.  ADB's strategy for the railway sector focuses on (i) expanding the railway system by \nconstructing new lines in unserved areas that are less-developed and poor; (ii) modernizing and \nincreasing the capacity to improve transport efficiency on key routes of the national railway \nsystem;  (iii)  commercializing  railway  operations  to  sustain  efficient  operations;  and  \n(iv) increasing railway competitiveness in the transport sector through restructuring and reform.  \n \n6.  Japan is the major source of external financing in the PRC railway sector, followed by \nthe World Bank and ADB. Since 1979, Japan has provided about Y558 billion for 15 railway \nprojects to expand rail transportation capacity. Since 1984, the World Bank has provided nine \nloans totaling more than $2.2 billion for (i) eight national railway projects to expand railway \ncapacity  on  high-priority  corridors,  modernize  system-wide  technology,  and  strengthen \ninstitutional capabilities; and (ii) one local railway project. ADB has focused on the development \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 10 January 2004. ", "2 \nof railways in less-developed inland provinces to promote sustainable economic growth and \nreduce poverty. ADB has provided 11 loans totaling $2.06 billion to finance the construction of \nabout 1,754 km of provincial railways operated by joint ventures with MOR, and 4,138 km of \nnew railway lines under four national railway projects.  \n \n7.  Policy dialogue has been a major element of ADB assistance to the railway sector, and \nhas complemented the lending operations. Since 1989, nine TAs totaling $4.2 million have been \nprovided for institutional development of local railways, tariff and organizational studies for the \nJing  Ju  railway,  enhancing  commercial  and  business  operations,  marketing  and  business \ndevelopment, developing human resources, and improving systems of financial management \nand accounting. Progress has been achieved as MOR has adopted a structured approach to \nrailway  reform.  A  new  management  concept,  the  Asset  Operating  Liability  System,  was \nintroduced  as  a  pilot  project  in  1999.  Under  this  system  MOR  entered  into  management \ncontracts with railway administrations to improve profitability. The management contracts helped \nimprove the operational and financial performance of the railway administrations. The system \nhas since been extended to all 14 railway administrations. Separation of core and non-core \nbusinesses is a key element of MOR\u2019s restructuring program. The total number of employees in \nthe core transportation business has been reduced from 1.89 million in1997 to 1.48 million in \n2002. In the non-core transportation business, five large companies employing 616,500 staff \nhave been divested. To provide jobs for redundant staff, by the end of 2002 MOR had set up \n7,681 diversified businesses (independent of the core transportation business), employing more \nthan 400,000 staff to supply equipment, goods, and services to the railway industry. In 1998, \nMOR initiated a cost-sharing scheme for health insurance and pensions for railway employees. \nSince  2000,  44  educational  institutes  and  10  universities  have  been  transferred  to  local \ngovernments and 120 branch lines comprising 7,800 km of route have been separated to \nimprove productivity and reduce operating losses. \n \n8.  MOR  has  taken  several  measures  to  improve  the  operational  and  management \ninformation  systems  for  the  railways,  including  the  development  and  introduction  of  the \nTransportation  Management  Information  System;  computerized  ticketing  systems  in  700 \nstations and 7,000 ticket sales points, accounting for 95% of the passengers; and use of an \ninterline revenue settlement system. MOR will introduce a state of the art dispatch management \ninformation system in all 14 railway administrations and 70 major trunk lines by 2005, and will \nintroduce centralized traffic control on several trunk lines by 2007. Consistent with growth in \nmulti modal transport, container transport in the railway sector has grown at three times the rate \nof ordinary freight traffic. MOR plans to set up an independent container company by the end of \n2005, and plans to build 18 large container terminals by 2007.  \n \n9.  Although the State Council regulates the tariff changes, MOR has been given flexibility \nto levy charges and fix tariffs within a defined range. In 1991, MOR was permitted to levy a \nseparate construction surcharge to most commodity tariffs, which is credited to a separate \nrailway construction fund. In 1993, the Government approved the policy of \u201cnew line, new tariff\u201d \nto generate revenue for cost recovery and to service the debt incurred to finance construction of \nnew lines. MOR was also authorized to levy a separate charge on traffic moving on electrified \ntracks. On the passenger side, MOR can levy a surcharge of 50% on fully airconditioned train \nservices, and can charge 30% higher fare during the peak season. In 1999, the freight tariff \nstructure was reclassified, and a new commodity-based tariff structure and additional charges \nfor freight loading and unloading were introduced.  \n \n10.  MOR  is  in  a  transition  phase  from  building  transport  capacity  to  institutional \ndevelopment. The Government has broadly defined the framework of railway restructuring to ", "    3 \nseparate government functions from enterprise functions; separate rail from non-rail functions; \nrationalize staff in core transportation, spinoff peripheral operations, and noncore operations; \nand reform the railway investment and financing system. ADB has enhanced its policy dialogue \nwith MOR, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the Ministry of \nFinance  (MOF).  The  World  Bank  and  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and \nDevelopment (OECD) have also been engaged in dialogues on many policy issues concerning \nthe PRC railways. OECD2 considered possible approaches to restructuring the PRC railways. \nThe conclusion was that, considering that rail reform takes time, determination of the reform \npath for the PRC railways should start now if the railway sector is to be effective by 2010.  \nThere is broad agreement on reforms in the transport sector for further railway development. \nMOR is preparing a Railway Development Plan that will set major goals to 2020, in consultation \nwith NDRC. The reform agenda that MOR has proposed for this plan seeks to (i) study and \nlearn from worldwide experience, (ii) clearly identify core operations and separate core and non-\ncore  transportation  businesses,  (iii)  rationalize  and  reduce  staff,  (iv)  reform  the  railway \ninvestment and financing system, and (v) establish specialized transportation companies.  \n \n11.  The PRC\u2019s December 2001 accession to WTO poses new challenges to the railways. \nCompetition among various modes will intensify, and the structure of transport demand will \nchange. Under the WTO rules, the General Agreement on Trade in Service (GATS) sets a \ncommon rule governing trade in services among member countries. The agreement includes \nprovisions  on  obligations,  general  principles,  and  exceptions.  GATS  includes  important \nobligations on monopoly regulation, franchises for service provision, national treatment, market \naccess,  and  domestic  regulation.  Disclosure  is  a  key  principle  of  multilateral  liberalization \nbecause it makes it easier for service providers to access and compete in markets of WTO \nmember countries. As part of the agreed obligations for market liberalization, GATS stipulates \nthat when market access is granted, the member countries must treat foreign and local services \nand service providers equally within the commitment framework.  \n \n12.  The Government is committed to following WTO rules and to opening railway freight \nmarkets and other services such as warehousing and freight forwarding to foreign partners.  \nThis  necessitates  a  study  that  will  help  service  providers  identify  business  opportunities.  \nThat involves determining what commitments the PRC has made under WTO in the railway and \nrelated sectors, and reviewing the regulations, domestic legal systems, and laws on investment \nand nondiscrimination to enable service providers to identify business opportunities. There is \nalso a need to study how MOR can accelerate changes in railway management, transform the \noperating mechanisms of railway enterprises, and establish policies and regulations to regulate \nmarket competition. Such a study will include review of previous studies by MOR, the PRC \nGovernment, and multilateral institutions; review of experiences of other international railways; \nand  consultation  with  other  stakeholders  such  as  MOF,  NDRC,  the  State  Council,  and \ngovernment officials. During the 2003 country-programming mission, the Government requested \nthat ADB provide a TA grant to examine the impact of WTO accession on other railways, and to \nhelp MOR prepare a policy reform plan consistent with its overall restructuring as described in \nthe Tenth Five Year Plan. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2  Summary and recommendations of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and \nDevelopment Research Center seminar on Railway Reform in Beijing 28\u201329 January 2002.

The objective of the proposed TA is to help MOR review potential impacts of the PRC \naccession to WTO, assess MOR\u2019s preparedness to address these impacts, and recommend \naction and policy reform support to meet these challenges. To achieve this objective, the TA will \nreview the impacts of WTO accession on the PRC railway sector and examine (i) management \nfunctions and how to separate enterprise and government functions; (ii) access to railway \nmarkets, including the current status of the PRC railway in the transport market, and challenges \nit faces due to competition and pricing; (iii) analyses of differences and gaps between current \nrailway management functions (including regulations) and methods, based on WTO rules; and \n(iv) the suitability of laws and regulations for safety, access to railway markets, service quality, \nprice, and investments. The study would enable utilization of the experiences in reform of other \ninternational railways, and would involve active participation of the PRC railway management.  \nA policy reform plan that MOR can implement will be the output. Appendix 1 gives the TA \nframework. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n14.  ADB  will  engage  a  team  comprised  of  an  international  consulting  firm  assisted  by \ndomestic consultants, using the quality and cost-based selection methods in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The TA will require about 26 months of consulting \nservices spread over 7 months. It will comprise about 14 person-months of international and  \n12 person-months of domestic consultants. The international consultants will have expertise in  \n(i) transport policy, regulations, and legal issues for railways; (ii) transport economics, including \nfiscal planning and pricing; and (iii) railway transportation and management. The international \nconsultants will be encouraged to use domestic consultants with expertise in (i) railway policy, \nregulations,  and  legal  issues;  (ii)  transport  economics;  and  (iii)  railway  transportation  and \nmanagement. Key activities will include review of the existing studies by MOR, the Government, \nother multilateral institutions; data analysis; and consultation with other stakeholders, including \nMOF, NDRC, and government officials. An overseas training program, a workshop, and a \nseminar will be organized to learn from experiences of other international railways, and to \ndisseminate findings of the TA. The consultants will procure equipment in accordance with \nprocedures acceptable to ADB.  Appendix 2 gives terms of reference. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $515,000 equivalent, comprised of $325,000 in \nforeign exchange and $190,000 equivalent in local currency (Appendix 3). ADB will provide \n$400,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $75,000 equivalent of local currency \ncosts. ADB will finance the TA on a grant basis from ADB's TA funding program. MOR will \nprovide the remaining $115,000 equivalent in local currency for counterpart staff, office facilities, \nand support services.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MOR, as the Executing Agency (EA), will appoint suitable counterpart staff who will \nsupervise and coordinate day-to-day TA activities, including monitoring of progress, resolving \nproblems, arranging meetings, and liaising with concerned government agencies, including ", "    5 \nMOF and NDRC. MOR and other appropriate ministries will provide policy guidance to the \nconsultants. MOR and concerned ministries will meet to discuss the consultants\u2019 report at \ninception, interim, and final draft stages. A workshop and a seminar will be held to review \nfindings  at  the  interim  and  final  stages  of  report  preparation.  Those  meetings  will  include \nrepresentatives of MOR, MOF, NDRC, other relevant agencies, ADB, and the consultants.  \nA final report will be published when the TA ends.  \n \n17.  The consultants are expected to begin work in July 2004 and to complete activities by \nJanuary 2005. The Government and MOR have agreed to provide assistance required for TA \nimplementation. MOR will make available to the consultants (i) all relevant reports, including \nrules and regulations, studies, and information required for TA implementation; (ii) offices and \nqualified  counterpart  staff;  and  (iii)  other  needed  assistance,  including  liaison  with  the \nGovernment and local authorities. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People's Republic of China for World Trade Organization-Policy Reform \nSupport to the Ministry of Railways, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nGoal       \n       \nTo promote an efficient,  (cid:131) Review of operating  (cid:131) People's Republic of China   \nreliable, and competitive  data   (PRC) railway statistics \nrailway transport system     \n(cid:131) Operating ratio of          \nless than 1 \n \nPurpose       \n       \nTo develop a policy reform  (cid:131) Increased traffic  (cid:131) PRC railway statistics  Government \nplan to enhance the  volumes    commitment to \ncompetitiveness of railway  (i)   Freight-kilometer    development of railway \ntransport due to World Trade  (ii) Passenger-   infrastructure and \nOrganization (WTO)  kilometer    reform of Ministry of \naccession      Railways (MOR) \n(cid:131) Enhanced customer  (cid:131) Reduced travel time \nsatisfaction    \n \nOutputs       \n       \n(cid:131) Technical assistance (TA)  (cid:131) TA report and  (cid:131) Consultants\u2019 technical  (cid:131) Policy reform plan is \nstudy completed  recommendations  assistance completion  consistent with the \n  submitted by January  report  Tenth Five Year Plan \n  2005    and will have \n    (cid:131) Asian Development Bank  government support \n    (ADB) and Government   \n    review of consultants\u2019  (cid:131) MOR is willing to \n(cid:131) Enhanced management  (cid:131) Training program  reports   adopt/adapt lessons \nskills   completed by    learned from \n  November 2004  (cid:131) ADB mission report  international \n      experiences \n  (cid:131) Workshop after     \n  interim report in  (cid:131) Government \nOctober 2004, and  nominates qualified \nfinal draft report in  and competent staff  \nDecember 2004     \n \nActivities       \n       \n(cid:131) TA inception    (cid:131) Starts July 2004, and  (cid:131) TA consultants\u2019 inception,  (cid:131) Coordinated inputs \n  is completed August  interim, and final reports  from Government   \n  2004     \n       \n(cid:131) TA interim review and  (cid:131) Starts September  (cid:131) ADB inception mission,  (cid:131)  Government and \nworkshop   2004, and is  interim review mission, and  ADB monitor TA \n  completed October  tripartite meeting   implementation \n  2004    closely  \n     \n(cid:131) TA final review and  (cid:131) Starts December \nseminar   2004, and is \n  completed January \n  2005 \n   \n(cid:131) Training program   (cid:131) November 2004 \n   ", "  Appendix 1  7 \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets    and Risks \n   \nInputs  ADB total: $400,000     \n       \n(cid:131) ADB consultants  $279,000  (cid:131) ADB\u2019s TA disbursement  (cid:131) Qualified consultants \n  (cid:131) International, 14  documents  can be hired in a \n  person-months,    timely manner \n  (cid:131) Domestic, 12 person     \n  months  (cid:131) Good government \n     cooperation and \n    timely availability of \n    counterpart staff \n     \n(cid:131) Training     (cid:131) Key officials are \n                     available, and can \nOverseas training    participate in study \nprogram  $35,000  tour and workshops \nWorkshops and     \nseminar  $17,000  (cid:131) Counterpart funding \n    is available in a \n(cid:131)  MOR counterpart funding   $115,000  timely manner   \n     \n(cid:131) Total funding   $515,000 \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, MOR = Ministry of Railways, PRC = People's Republic of China, TA = technical \nassistance. \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS \n \nA.  Objective \n \n1.  The objectives of the proposed technical assistance (TA) are (i) to help the Ministry of \nRailways  (MOR)  review  the  potential  impacts  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China\u2019s  (PRC) \naccession  to  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO),  (ii)  to  assess  MOR\u2019s  preparedness  to \naddress those impacts, and (iii) to recommend actions and policy reform support needed to \nmeet these challenges.  \n \n2.
