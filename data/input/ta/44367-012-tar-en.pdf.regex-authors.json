INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of India has asked that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) continue \nproviding policy advisory technical assistance (TA) for knowledge management activities.  This \nrequest follows two previous knowledge management TA projects that met the government\u2019s \nexpectations  regarding  ADB\u2019s  role  as  a  knowledge  provider  by  supporting  analytical \nassessments in critical areas of development and reform, documentation, and dissemination.1 \nWhile the earlier TA included capacity building, the government has asked that this TA focus on \nknowledge management activities in knowledge creation, dissemination, and partnerships. The \nTA will aim to provide advisory inputs for government policy and projects related to achieving \ninclusive growth, especially in areas relevant to ADB\u2019s India program.  ADB and the government \nhave reached agreement on the impact, outcome, implementation arrangements, and cost and \nfinancing arrangements of the TA.2 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \n2.  The knowledge management activities of this TA align with ADB\u2019s commitment to being \na primary source of development knowledge in the Asia and Pacific region. This commitment \naims to improve the quality of ADB operations and enhance the capacity of developing member \ncountries.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020 identifies help for developing countries to gain knowledge as an \nimportant driver of change.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The  TA  is  designed  to  use  knowledge  management  activities  to  support  the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts at promoting inclusive growth. Under the government\u2019s Eleventh Five-Year \nPlan (April 2007\u2013March 2012), inclusive growth involves a broad-based improvement in living \nstandards and requires not only that economic growth be high and sustainable but that it also be \ndispersed by region and sector and both generate and be driven by good quality employment \nfor the workforce at large. \n \n4.  In its pursuit of inclusive growth, the government has put a priority on tackling India\u2019s \ninfrastructure deficit, spurring growth in lagging states, reinvigorating the rural economy, and \nenabling manufacturing and services to generate good jobs on a large scale. These efforts to \nexpand economic opportunities are being complemented by a critically important stepping-up of \ninvestments  in  education  and  health  and  a  host  of  targeted  social  and  livelihood-related \nprograms for the poor. The government also recognizes the need to ensure that growth is \nenvironmentally sustainable. \n \n5.  The TA will seek to help answer many questions about the effectiveness of these efforts, \nwith a view to using the knowledge to improve future policy and planning for inclusive growth \nand ADB\u2019s own operations including support for ADB\u2019s knowledge management action plan.4 \nThese questions are particularly important at this juncture, given the government's ambitious \ninclusive growth program and its recent willingness to use innovative mechanisms to finance \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to India for Knowledge Management and Capacity Building. Manila (TA 4780-\nIND, for $2,000,000, approved on 17 April); ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to India for Knowledge Management \nfor Enhanced Operational Effectiveness. Manila (TA 7092-IND, $1,000,000, approved on 27 June, closing on 30 \nJune 2011). \n2  The TA was not included in the country operations business plan 2011\u20132013 but has been included in the 2010 \ncountry program, based on discussions with the government. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities \nsection of ADB\u2019s website on 23 November 2010.  \n3  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila.  \n4 ADB.2009. Enhancing Knowledge Management Under Strategy 2020: Plan of Action for 2009-2011. Manila \n ", " 2 \nand manage initiatives under this agenda.  For example, investment in agriculture\u2014for too long \na  lagging  sector  in  India\u2014has  increased  in  a  significant  way,  while  the  Prime  Minister\u2019s \nGrameen Sadak Yojana (a central government program for building all-weather roads in rural \nareas), which has been supported by ADB, has improved rural road connectivity.  What is the \nimpact  of  these  interventions  on  development  outcomes?    Are  there  complementary \ninterventions that can raise their effectiveness\u2014for example, improving access to finance for \nrural entrepreneurs and providing skills development programs? The government is also relying \non or considering the use of public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs) to alleviate both financial and \nmanagerial  constraints  across  a  broad  range  of  sectors,  including  transport  and  energy \ninfrastructure and education and skills development. What are the emerging lessons from the \nuse of PPPs in different sectors and contexts? \n \n6.  Answering questions such as these is also crucially important to ADB's India operations. \nADB's India country partnership strategy, 2009\u20132012 and the draft country operations business \nplan, 2011\u20132013 have been designed to support the government\u2019s efforts at promoting inclusive \ngrowth.5 Prior to 2003, ADB had operations in states that are relatively better-off, such as \nGujarat, Karnataka, and Kerala. ADB assistance has since been extended to states such as \nAssam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Rajasthan that suffer from \none or more of the following problems: high poverty incidence, low levels of social development, \nweak capacity, and poor infrastructure.  In addition, the recent expansion of operations into new \nsectors such as agribusiness, water resources management, and support for the development \nof rural cooperatives and micro, small, and medium enterprises will make ADB\u2019s support for the \ngovernment\u2019s inclusive growth agenda more direct. Knowledge management activities, including \nknowledge creation, dissemination, and partnerships, will be critical for ensuring that these and \nfuture efforts are highly effective.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The expected impact of the TA will be to raise the development effectiveness of policy \nand project interventions in sectors that are identified by the government as crucial for achieving \ninclusive growth and are of operational relevance to ADB.  The TA aims to do this through its \nexpected outcome\u2014improved understanding of the types of policy and project interventions that \nare  effective  in  promoting  inclusive  growth  and  the  dissemination  of  the  TA  outputs  that \ncontribute to this improved understanding. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will generate and disseminate evidence on the types of policy and project \ninterventions that are effective in promoting inclusive growth through three types of activities: \n \n1.  Knowledge Creation \n \n9.  The TA will support studies aimed at promoting a better understanding of the impact and \neffectiveness of different types of policies and projects.  The studies will focus on sectors and \nissues that are identified by the government as crucial for achieving inclusive growth and are of \noperational relevance to ADB.  While there will be flexibility on the types of studies carried out, \nthe  three  main  categories  include  in-depth  studies  on  selected  sector  or  thematic  issues, \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: India, 2009\u20132012. Manila. \n ", "  3\nscoping  studies  that  conduct  an  initial  analysis  on  a  given  topic  or  issue,  and  shorter \ndevelopment briefs.6 \n \n10.  While  development  briefs  will  focus  on  distilling  lessons  from  ADB  operations  on \noperational effectiveness and development outcomes, and include assessments of operational \nrisk as necessary, the topics and scope of the other two types of studies will be broader. \nProspective topics include options for promoting financial inclusion; understanding the nature of \nskill deficits and modalities for reducing these; raising agricultural productivity and improving \nrural livelihoods through, for example, water and natural resource management; determining \nefficient and feasible approaches for providing low-cost housing in urban areas; fostering the \ndevelopment of small and medium-sized enterprises; and the efficacy of PPPs in areas such as \nrural health and education services.   \n \n11.  Some studies are expected to focus on documenting how key development outcomes \nhave  evolved  over  time  and  across  India  and  selected  states  and  on  understanding  the \nchannels that influence the evolution of these development outcomes.7  Some studies may also \nfocus on macroeconomic issues that set the context in which ADB's India program operates and \ndirectly impinge on selected ADB operations, such as ADB's involvement in fiscal reforms in \nselect Indian states.  Macroeconomic issues also often have direct effects on the government's \nability  to  make  growth  more  inclusive.  Regional  cooperation  and  environment  and  climate \nchange issues will be incorporated, as required and feasible. \n \n12.  The methodologies to be used by the studies will be driven by their scope. Thus, studies \nare expected to be based variously on desk reviews, field visits, comparative analyses, and the \nanalysis of survey and administrative data, among other approaches.  Both qualitative analysis \n(for  example,  case  studies  using  key  informant  interviews)  and  quantitative  analysis  (for \nexample, analysis of survey data using statistical and econometric tools) will be employed, \ndepending on need and feasibility. Both pre- and post-policy or project impact assessment \nmethods will be considered.  High standards of rigor will be maintained in all cases.  \n \n13.  The  specific  topics  and  issues  that  will  be  studied  will  be  determined  through \nconsultations with the government, ADB sector specialists, and external experts. An advisory \ncommittee (detailed in para. 22) will make the final decision on which studies will be carried out \nunder the TA. The studies will be undertaken in-house; through national and/or international \nconsultants; by accredited institutions or firms; and/or in partnership with research institutions \nthrough memorandums of understanding (MOUs) under guidance of the advisory committee. \n \n2.  Knowledge Dissemination \n \n14.  Conferences,  seminars,  workshops,  and  other  knowledge-sharing  activities. \nBesides  events  to  disseminate  study  findings  among  stakeholders,  the  TA  will  support \nconferences,  seminars,  and  workshop  events  on  a  focused  basis.  These  will  be  in  areas \nrelevant to ADB operations in India. Resource persons will collate outcomes and synthesize \nhighlights of learning events for broader dissemination, when necessary.  \n                                                 \n6  Scoping studies typically involve a brief survey of the state of knowledge on a given topic or issue.

Publications. Studies carried out under the TA and by ADB, conference outcomes, \ngood  practices,  and  other  material  that  will  enhance  value  added  and  awareness  through \nknowledge dissemination will be considered for publication. The publications will be in line with \nADB goals and cleared by the Department of External Relations in accordance with ADB \nprocedures. \n \n16.  Internal knowledge enhancement through cross-learning. To encourage creation \nand sharing of knowledge and experiences, knowledge enhancement events will be supported \nfor staff on development effectiveness issues. \n \n17.  Visits to best-practices sites (national, regional, or international) for learning by \nseeing. The TA will support hands-on learning through visits to sites of successful initiatives by \ngovernment officials who are directly concerned with project design and implementation. Sector \nspecialists or mission leaders of the various ongoing and proposed ADB-supported projects will \nprepare requests for such site visits. Participating officials from executing agencies will be \nrequired to prepare and provide a two-page report on how they propose to operationalize the \nlessons from the study tours and will conduct a dissemination seminar for other members in the \nexecuting agencies and sector departments.  \n \n18.  Web-based  electronic  facility.  The  TA  will  support  the  creation  of  a  web-based \nelectronic facility and the use of information technology for knowledge sharing. This will include \nhardware  and  software  components  (i.e.,  enablers  such  as  document  repositories,  portal \ndevelopment, and online conference tools).  \n \n  3.  Knowledge Partnerships and Networking \n \n19.  The TA will also support partnerships and networking activities through MOUs between \nADB and such knowledge partners as senior policymakers, public nonprofit research institutions \nof  national  importance,  civil  society  stakeholders,  individual  experts,  and  opinion  makers. \nSupport  to  and  collaboration  with  academic  and  research  institutions,  think  tanks,  and \ndevelopment partners will be undertaken on identified issues.  MOUs will be signed for studies \nthat will forge linkages and develop networks for dialogue and to disseminate findings. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The estimated cost of the TA is equivalent to $1,875,000, of which, the equivalent of \n$1,500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund \n(TASF-other sources). The government will finance the equivalent of $375,000 in kind.  The cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The  Department  of  Economic  Affairs  (DEA)  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the \nexecuting agency for the TA.  The DEA will partner closely with ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission in \nimplementing  the  TA.    In  addition  to  providing  counterpart  staff  and  assisting  with \ndocumentation  requirements,  the  DEA  will  consult  with  government  agencies  on  their \nknowledge management needs.  The resident mission will coordinate overall implementation of \nthe TA. \n \n ", "  5\n22.  The TA will be guided by an advisory committee co-chaired by the country director of the \nIndia  Resident  Mission  and  the  joint  secretary  (multilateral  institutions)  of  the  DEA.  The \ncommittee will comprise the ADB project officer and sector specialists at the resident mission.  \nInputs from sector directors of ADB South Asia Department and representatives from ADB \nRegional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  and  ADB  Economics  Research \nDepartment will be sought, when appropriate. The advisory committee will meet as needed to \nmonitor progress of TA activities. \n \n23.  The  TA  approval  mechanism  is  designed  to  ensure  timely  response  to  operational \nrequirements. For proposals involving major knowledge creation activities, such as in-depth \nstudies, the advisory committee will be responsible for endorsement and approval. The country \ndirector, India Resident Mission will be responsible for endorsement and approval of (i) minor \nknowledge-creation  activities  involving  scoping  studies  and  low-cost  desk  studies;  (ii) \nknowledge  dissemination  activities  such  as  workshops,  seminars,  and  conferences;  (iii) \nmeetings and retreats; and (iv) learning events. Feedback from peer reviewers and national and \ninternational experts will be sought to evaluate studies and ensure quality.  Subcommittees of \npolicymakers and experts may be constituted for some of the more detailed in-depth studies.  \n \n24.  The TA will require about 154 person-months of consulting services, consisting of 10 \nperson-months of international inputs, 96 person-months of national inputs, and 48 person-\nmonths of survey and associated study inputs by a firm.  It will be implemented over a 3-year \nperiod (36 months), with an additional 3 months for TA closing. International and national \nindividual consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). In addition, the TA will also \nfinance a survey-based study by a firm or institution engaged through consultants\u2019 qualification \nselection  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  The  choice  of \nconsultants\u2019 qualification selection stems from the relatively small budget for the survey work \n($100,000) and the straightforward but specialized nature of the work. Disbursements under the \nTA will be made in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). \n \n25.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  a  3-year  period,  from  15  December  2010  to  14 \nDecember 2013. TA outputs will be disseminated thorough publication of discussion papers, \nbooks, reports, conference and seminar briefings, etc., and will also be posted on the intranet.  \n \nIV.
