The Government of India (the Government) has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to support integration of knowledge management \ninto various aspects of ADB operations in India to enhance their effectiveness. This has been \nthe  outcome  of  consultations  between  the  Government  and  ADB,  and  the  positive \ndemonstration effect provided by the Knowledge Management and Capacity Building TA1, \nwhich closes on 30 June 2008. Subsequent to consultations, ADB and the Government reached \nan agreement on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, and cost and \nfinancing arrangements for this follow-on TA.2 The design and monitoring framework for the TA \nis in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB is committed to being a primary source of development knowledge in the Asia and \nPacific region. To fulfill this mandate, it has adopted both external and internal approaches. The \nexternal  approaches  include  creation  of  knowledge  products,  knowledge  hubs,  knowledge \npartnership funds, and active promotion of public communications. Its internal approaches have \nfocused on its various communities of practice, incentive systems, and eminent speaker forums. \n \n3.  This commitment to become a learning organization aims to improve the quality of ADB \noperations and enhance the capacity of developing member countries. To do this, knowledge \nmanagement  activities  need  to  be  linked  closely  to  ADB\u2019s  core  lending  and  nonlending \nprocesses. 3   ADB  operations  and  services  should  reside  in  finance,  knowledge,  and \ncoordination.4 The long-term strategic framework (Strategy 2020)5 identifies helping developing \ncountries gain knowledge as an important driver of change. \n \n4.  India is well positioned to take advantage of the knowledge revolution to accelerate \ngrowth and competitiveness, primarily because of the skill and labor capacity of its citizens and \nits information and communication technology capabilities.6 \n \n5.  The TA is designed to support the strategic development focus of the Government and \nADB  of  creating  an  enabling  environment  for  sustainable  and  inclusive  growth  through \nknowledge management, aimed at enhanced operational effectiveness. The ADB portfolio in \nIndia has aimed at poverty reduction and inclusive growth through support for creation of \nphysical and social infrastructure. It has expanded to include pro-poor sectors such as rural \nroads, rural finance, and water resource development. There has also been increased focus on \nrelatively poorer states or those with weaker institutional and financial capacities. With strategic \nchanges in the country program, there is a strong need to analyze linkages and impacts to \nensure enhanced operational efficiencies7.  \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to India for Knowledge Management and Capacity Building. Manila (TA 4780-IND, \nfor $2,000,000, approved on 17 April). \n2 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 May 2008. \n3 ADB. 2007.

Capacity  development  through  knowledge  transfer  is  necessary  for  enhanced \noperational effectiveness. The TA will address the strongly felt needs of the Government and \nensure client responsiveness by supporting capacity enhancement in poorer states with weaker \ncapacities. In many of the ongoing projects, one of the causes cited for operational delays is the \nlack  of  adequate  information  and  understanding  of  ADB  policies  and  procedures  in  the \nexecuting agencies (EAs), including social safeguards, procurement, and consultant recruitment. \nThe TA will address this gap.  \n \n7.  The TA will be a sequel to the Knowledge Management and Capacity Building TA and \nthe earlier Integrating Poverty Reduction in Programs and Projects TA8, which demonstrated \nthe  importance  of  a  flexible  approach  and  systematic  capacity  development  for  enhanced \ndevelopment outcomes. Both these TA projects were supported under the United Kingdom \nCooperation Fund (Poverty Focused) for Technical Assistance (Trust Fund).  \n \n8.  An in-house assessment of the Knowledge Management and Capacity Building TA and \nfeedback from the Government reveals that TA 4780 greatly added value to the knowledge \nmanagement  process.  Portfolio  review  meetings  supported  under  TA  4780  have  helped \nenhance portfolio performance substantially in 2006 and 2007, increasing disbursements from \n$641 million in 2005 to $701 million in 2006 and about $1.4 billion in 2007. Many analytical \nstudies (including key areas such as urban poverty) and publications have emerged out of TA \n4780. The conferences and seminars component supported dialogue and engagement with key \ngovernment, civil society, and private sector stakeholders on development themes of current \nand emerging relevance including public-private partnerships in infrastructure development. \nSmall-scale, innovative projects have been supported under the poverty reduction component. \nADB has entered into knowledge partnerships with other donors.  ADB is partnering the United \nNations solution exchange initiative in India and has supported the functioning of \u201ccommunities \nof  practice\u201d  on  the  themes  of  poverty,  health,  environment,  disaster  management,  and \ninformation  and  communication  technology  for  development.  ADB  also  entered  into  a \npartnership with the World Bank in India to support its small grants program, India Development \nMarketplace 2007, to finance grassroots initiatives for the protection and management of natural \nresources. Given the positive impacts on ADB\u2019s India program and portfolio management, as \nwell as the high priority attached to this TA by the Government during fact-finding, this TA is \nbeing processed as a sequel to Knowledge Management and Capacity Building TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The expected impact of the TA is to create an enabling environment for sustainable and \ninclusive growth through knowledge management and capacity enhancement. The outcome will \nbe reflected in the enhanced operational effectiveness of ADB\u2019s India operations from effective \nknowledge creation, dissemination, capacity enhancement, and partnerships. This creation and \nintegration of knowledge will focus on key areas of operational relevance in the ADB India \nprogram such as transport, energy, urban infrastructure, financial sector, and water resources. \nFocus will be on sectors important for inclusive growth and poverty reduction as identified by the \nGovernment9 and those identified by ADB in Strategy 2020. It will also support knowledge \nmanagement at the state level, especially in states where ADB has operations. Under capacity \nenhancement, the TA will support knowledge sharing activities, dissemination of best practices, \nand capacity development. \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2002.

Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will promote enhanced operational efficiency of ADB operations in India by \nsupporting  the  following  components:  (i)  knowledge  creation,  (ii)  knowledge  dissemination, \n(iii) knowledge for improved operational effectiveness, and (iv) knowledge partnerships and \nnetworking. \n \n11.  The activities and outputs under these components will include the following: \n \n  1.  Knowledge Creation \n12.  Studies, Impact Assessments, Evaluation Studies, and Appraisals in Important \nAreas of Inclusive Growth and Operational Relevance. The TA will support undertaking of \nneed-based analytical and sector studies, and impact assessments. These will be in the key \noperational sectors relating to the ADB program in India. The studies will include national and \nstate level studies, desk reviews, and field studies. The TA will cover about 3\u20134 such studies \nwith costing about $25,000\u2013$30,000 each. The studies will be focused on the ongoing and \nfuture program of ADB in India, and will be carried out by accredited institutions or firms. The \nterms of reference for the proposed work and its documentation plan will be provided by the \nsector division requesting the work. A memorandum of understanding will be signed with each \nof the institutions undertaking the studies to ensure, among others, agreement on the terms of \nreference and manner of presentation of the outcomes of the study. Partnerships with research \nand knowledge-based institutions will be supported, as required, under this activity. Efforts will \nbe made to identify operationally relevant reports for wider dissemination in coordination with \nADB\u2019s Department of External Relations. \n \n13.  Consulting Services to Provide Value Added to Knowledge Creation. Individual \nnational consultants will be engaged over the period of the TA on a needs basis to provide \nspecialized inputs in the operational sectors, states, and crosscutting themes.  \n \n2.  Knowledge Dissemination \n14.  Conferences, Seminars, Workshops, and Other Knowledge-Sharing Activities. The \nTA will support conferences, seminars, and workshop events on a focused basis. These will be \nin areas of relevance for ADB operations in India. The relevance of the events will be clearly \nspelled out. Visibility for ADB and its partners will be aimed at, where feasible. Resource \npersons will be tasked to collate outcomes and highlights of various learning events for broader \ndissemination as deemed necessary.  \n \n15.  Publications to Support Such Dissemination. Publication of studies undertaken both \nunder the TA and by ADB, conference outcomes, good practices, and other material that will \nenhance value added and awareness through knowledge dissemination, will be considered for \npublication. The publications will be in keeping with ADB\u2019s goals, and will receive the necessary \nno objection clearances from ADB\u2019s Department of External Relations in accordance with ADB \nprocedures.  \n \n16.  Internal Knowledge Enhancement through Cross-Learning. To encourage creation \nand sharing of knowledge and experiences, events targeting knowledge enhancement among \nstaff on key development and operational issues will be supported.  \n \n3.  Knowledge for Enhanced Operational effectiveness \n \n17.  Capacity  Development  of  EAs  on  Important  Operational  Matters.  Capacity \ndevelopment under the TA will cover operational issues pertaining to both old and new EAs and \n ", "4   \nstates.  It  will  support  capacity  building  on  various  aspects  of  project  processing  and \nimplementation, but it will be need-based and identified by the EA and ADB. The EAs/mission \nleaders  processing  project  preparatory  TA  projects  or  implementing  projects  may  provide \nfeedback to the Government and the India Resident Mission (INRM) on identified capacity \nbuilding requirements, and the advisory committee will decide.  \n \n18.  Support  for  Portfolio  Reviews  and  Tripartite  Meetings  to  Ensure  Critical \nKnowledge Exchange on Operational Issues: Meetings and Retreats on Portfolio Matters. \nADB operations in India have been expanding both in terms of new states and sectors. As a \nresult,  several  operational  matters  emerge  that  need  to  be  discussed,  brainstormed,  and \nresolved. Meetings with various EAs in the sectors of ADB operations serve as an important \ncross-learning platform for agencies and states. About 4\u20135 such meetings and retreats are \nproposed to be held during the 2-year duration of the TA, averaging about $30,000 each.   \n \n19.  Visit to Best Practice Sites (National, Regional, or International) for Learning by \nSeeing  Successful  Initiatives.  There  are  sector-related  and  state  level  experiences  from \ncompleted projects within the country, and experiences in the Asia region and internationally. \nThe Government (central and state) greatly values such cross-learning. The TA will support \nhands-on  learning  through  site  visits  by  those  directly  concerned  with  project  design  and \nimplementation. Sector specialists or mission leaders of the various ADB-supported ongoing \nand proposed projects will prepare requests for such site visits, which will add value to project \ndesign and implementation. Participating officials from EAs will be required to prepare and \nprovide a two-page report on how they propose to operationalize the lessons from the study \ntours,  and  conduct  a  dissemination  seminar  for  other  members  in  the  EAs  and  sector \ndepartments. All study tour proposals will be endorsed by the advisory committee set up under \nthe TA or by the country director of INRM. \n \n20.  Knowledge  Technologies  and  Enablers.  The  TA  will  improve  the  efficiency  of \nknowledge creation, processing, and sharing, through both hardware and software components. \nSuch enablers have been created in ADB, including C-Cube (communication, coordination, and \ncollaboration); creation of the skills database; document repositories; and portal development. \nThese  help  in  real-time  sharing  of  information,  while  passwords  protect  access  to  ensure \nsecurity. Other examples of enablers include online meeting and conference tools, and project \nmanagement tools. \n \n  4.  Knowledge Partnerships and Networking \n \n21.  Select Innovative Projects for Inclusive Growth, including Civil Society Projects. \nThe TA proposes to support innovative projects by developmental nongovernment organizations \nand community-based organizations, which promote inclusive growth. These projects will have \nlinkages to ADB\u2019s operations in India. The projects will typically be in the range of $10,000\u2013\n$20,000.  Requests  received  will  be  reviewed  based  on  relevance  to  the  stated  purpose. \nSelection will be endorsed by the country director of INRM and the advisory committee. \n \n22.  Knowledge Partnerships with Development Partners. In keeping with the goal of \nharmonization in knowledge creation and sharing, knowledge partnerships with development \npartners will be supported through memorandums of understanding. Such partnerships will \naddress  various  aspects  of  knowledge  management,  and  seek  to  enhance  efficiencies  in \nknowledge  creation  and  sharing.  Instances  of  such  partnerships  under  the  Knowledge \nManagement and Capacity Building TA are in paragraph 8.  \n \n23.  Public-Private or Public-Community Partnership Pilots and Models. Partnerships \nwith the private sector and communities are highly beneficial. Public-private partnerships help ", "  5\nsupplement resources and combine strengths to achieve development goals. Partnerships with \ncommunities help in effective community needs assessments and resource mapping, which \nhelp  design  and  implement  inclusive  projects.  The  TA  hopes  to  support  innovative  pilot \npartnership projects for infrastructure creation or service delivery. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n24.  The total estimated cost of the TA is $1,250,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  Government  will  provide  counterpart \ncontributions in kind estimated at $250,000. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n25.  The Department of Economic Affairs of the Government will be the EA for the TA. The \nEA will be a proactive partner in the implementation of this TA and it will consult various \nimplementing agencies, as required and nominate staff for participation in the various capacity \nbuilding events. INRM will coordinate overall implementation of the TA.   \n \n26.  An advisory committee, headed by the country director of INRM and cochaired by the \njoint secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs, will be constituted. It will comprise ADB\u2019s \nproject officer, sector specialists at INRM, sector directors in the South Asia Department, and \nrepresentatives  from  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  and  the \nEconomics Research Department, as necessary. The advisory committee will meet at least \nonce every 6 months, with representatives from ADB headquarters joining via videoconference. \nTo ensure a timely response to operational requirements, the approval mechanism will be as \nfollows. For activities such as analytical work, impact assessments, and small grant projects that \ncan be identified and planned in advance, the advisory committee will endorse inclusion of such \nproposals. The country director of INRM will be responsible for endorsement and approval of \nactivities  such  as  workshops,  seminars,  and  conferences;  meetings  and  retreats;  learning \nevents;  and  capacity  building.  No  objection  concurrence  of  the  EA  will  be  obtained  for \nrecruitment of consultants. These approval mechanisms have been designed to ensure the \ntimely response of the TA to various operational requirements.  \n \n27.  Recruitment  of  Individual  Short-Term  National  Consultants.  Individual  national \nshort-term  consultants  (3\u20134)  will  be  hired  on  a  need  basis,  depending  on  operational \nrequirements. International expertise will be co-opted in the form of resource persons, as and \nwhen required. The short-term consultants engaged under the TA will be recruited by ADB in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nMore information on consulting services is in Appendix 3.   \n \n28.  The TA outputs will be spread over the period of implementation of the TA\u2014from 1 July \n2008 to 30 June 2010. They will be disseminated through (i) study reports, (ii) publications, \n(iii) reports on study tours, (iv) reports on capacity building and relevance, (v) project reports on \nsmall grant activities, (vi) seminars within ADB, and (vii) briefs on the INRM website and/or \nSouth Asia Department intranet. \n \nIV.
