INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed cluster capacity development technical assistance (TA), supported on a \ngrant basis under the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund (UCCRTF), aims to improve \ninstitutional capacities of the Government of India to identify, plan, invest in, and respond to \nclimate change and disaster-related risks in vulnerable cities and towns across India. The key \nobjectives of the TA are to (i) mainstream urban climate change resilience in policies, strategies, \nand plans at the national, state, and city levels; (ii) strengthen structural and nonstructural \ninvestments in selected cities; and (iii) build strong government institutions across the central, \nstate, and local levels. Cities highly vulnerable to climate change will be targeted, particularly \nthose in coastal areas and river basins. \n \n2.  The TA will provide direction to the government in developing well-planned cities which \nare livable, sustainable, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and resilient to climate-change-\nrelated risks. The TA builds from the country partnership strategy, 2013\u20132017 for India of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), which supports (i) energy efficiency (e.g., smart grids, efficient \npumps); (ii) sustainable transport systems; and (iii) efficient and sustainable water management, \nincluding  advice  on  policy  and  institutional  reforms.1 ADB's  urban  program  focuses  on \nexpanding the coverage, quality, and continuity of inclusive basic services while embracing the \nprinciples of resilience and efficiency. The government confirmed the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference through \nconfirmation of the aide-m\u00e9moire of the TA fact-finding mission.2 \n \n3.  The  TA  promotes  convergence  with  various  government  flagship  national  missions \nincluding smart cities, new and renewable energy, \u201cmake in India\u201d, clean India, housing for all, \nand urban transport initiatives. Considering the multifaceted demands for building resilience, the \nTA will support various sectors, i.e., urban, water, energy, transport, and natural resources \nmanagement. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Projected temperature changes in India are 0.6\u00b0C\u20132.4\u00b0C in 2030, 1.1\u00b0C\u20133.5\u00b0C in 2050, \nand  1.9\u00b0C\u20136.2\u00b0C  in  2080,  with  warming  pronounced  in  western  and  central  parts  of  the \ncountry.3 Such increases in temperature would result in precipitation increase of more than 20%, \nsea-level rise, and more extreme weather events. Recent examples of climate-related disasters \ninclude  flashflooding  in  Uttarakhand  in  2012,  and  Cyclone  Phailin  in  Odisha  and  Andhra \nPradesh in October 2013. Within Asia, 24% of deaths are due to disasters that occurred in India. \nThis high percentage is a result of the country\u2019s size, population, and vulnerability, where the \npoor and women are disproportionately affected. Cities in coastal areas and along rivers are \nespecially vulnerable to flooding, which results in significant losses and damage to (i) property, \ninfrastructure, and services; and (ii) energy, transport, and food systems. This threatens the \nsafety, livability, and overall economic growth of urban areas. \n \n5.  A 2014 study conducted by ADB predicted that climate change impacts would result in \n1.8% loss of India\u2019s annual gross domestic product (GDP) by 2050 (footnote 3). Considering the \nmajor contribution of cities to GDP (more than 60% of India\u2019s GDP is from cities, and this is \nexpected to increase to 75% by 2020), there is an urgent need to strengthen urban climate \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2013.

A resilient city would have the institutional and physical \ncapacity to withstand the impacts of climate change and disasters, while mitigation efforts would \nhelp reduce climate impacts.4 \n \n6.  Cities  in  India  are  not  ready  to  cope  with  the  impacts  of  climate  change.  Large \ninfrastructure deficits in drainage, flood control, water supply, solid-waste management, energy, \nand  public  transport  systems  exacerbate  sensitivity.  High  urbanization  creates  additional \npressures on existing infrastructure designed for smaller populations, forcing residents into \nmarginal and often vulnerable parts of cities. Infrastructure planning needs to consider climate \nchange  to  ensure  investments  deliver  intended  benefits.  There  is  also  an  urgent  need  to \nstrengthen  urban  governance  and  management  through  institutional  reforms.  Local \ngovernments  lack  capacity  to  plan  and  control  land  use  and  development;  design  and \nimplement early warning systems; promote community awareness and participation, especially \nfor the poor and women; and ensure financial sustainability of public assets. \n \n7.  Given the wide range of institutional capacities across urban India in strategic planning \nand project preparation, coupled with limited knowledge and understanding of climate change, a \ncomprehensive and focused intervention through a cluster TA approach is appropriate. A cluster \nTA is justified over a stand-alone TA for two reasons: (i) strengthening urban resilience requires \na series of interventions over time with comprehensive support from multiple sectors\u2014urban, \nenergy, transport, and water resources management; and (ii) customized TA support is required \nin  parallel  at  different  administrative  levels\u2014central,  state,  and  city\u2014to  build  required \ninstitutional capacity. Although mandates to manage cities are largely decentralized to city \ngovernments, significant policy, spatial planning, and capital investment decisions are retained \nat the central and state levels. Therefore, the TA needs to (i) support the Ministry of Urban \nDevelopment and other central ministries with influence on urban areas; and (ii) in parallel, \nsupport selected states and cities. Some institutions require limited support in the form of \nincremental consulting services for project preparation or capacity support in specialized areas \nof resilience planning; some require policy and advisory TA; some need conventional project \npreparatory  TA,  especially  for  climate-change-resilient  infrastructure;  while  many  require \nextensive all-round support. The cluster TA approach offers flexibility to meet diverse and fast-\nemerging requirements, and will be relevant, responsive, and results oriented. \n \n8.  Approval of the ADB Board of Directors is requested to include project preparatory TA in \nthe cluster capacity development TA on an exceptional basis to (i) address the considerable \ncapacity gap in preparing urban climate-change-resilient investment projects, and (ii) enhance \nthe  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  India  program  in  addressing  a  critical  cross-sector \ntheme.5 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The overall impact will be urban climate change resilience in selected states in India \nmainstreamed. The expected outcome will be capacity of government to successfully implement \nurban  climate-change-resilient  projects  enhanced.  The  outputs  include:  (i)  climate  change \nresilience  in  urban  policies  and  plans  mainstreamed;  (ii)  climate  change  resilience  of \n                                                \n4  Carbon dioxide reduction occurs through the use of renewable energy sources (solar power street lights, water \npumps); optimization of existing infrastructure and networks for improved energy efficiency; or use of biogas from \nsludge, landfill gas recovery, avoidance of methane gas from organic composting, and waste-to-energy facilities. \n5  Safeguard policy requirements applicable to project preparatory TA will be maintained. \n ", "3 \ninfrastructure and project development supported; and (iii) institutional capacity, community \nawareness,  and  knowledge  for  sustaining  climate-change-resilient  cities  strengthened.  TA \noutputs will be achieved primarily through the following activities: (i) comprehensively assessing \nand selecting policy instruments which promote urban climate change resilience, (ii) conducting \ninstitutional and sector analyses, (iii) conducting risk and vulnerability assessments in selected \ncities, (iv) preparing city-level climate-change-resilience plans, (v) supporting feasibility studies \nfor identified projects, and (vi) delivering climate change awareness programs. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The UCCRTF subproject selection criteria (Supplementary Appendix 1) will guide cluster \nTA subproject designs and city selection to be finalized during the TA implementation. The key \ncriteria include geographic vulnerability of urban area, government buy in, and local capacity \nand ownership. The TA will (i) reduce the number of stand-alone TA projects, (ii) support project \nreadiness  of  projects  through  advanced  preparation,  and  (iii)  integrate  best  practices  into \nstructural and nonstructural investment components. The government\u2019s capacity to successfully \nimplement urban climate-change-resilient projects will be significantly strengthened through TA \noutputs, including policy advisories, improved urban and investment planning, and awareness \nbuilding and knowledge exchange. \n \n11.  Key  activities  to  be  supported  under  the TA  include  (i)  assessing  and  advising  on \nstrategies, policies, and regulations at the central and state levels; (ii) conducting hazard risk \nand vulnerability analyses; (iii) preparing city-level climate change resilience plans and early \nwarning  systems;  (iv)  developing  good  models  and  case  studies  and  disseminating  best \npractices; (v) undertaking community awareness raising and skill training; (vi) building capacity \nof government officials; (vii) project scoping and investment planning; (viii) conducting feasibility \nstudies  with  preliminary  engineering  designs  and  cost  estimates; 6  and  (ix)  supporting \nimplementation of related activities. The responsibility for identifying and implementing these \nactivities will rest with respective project officers of the TA subproject. An indicative list of TA \nsubprojects  discussed  with  the  government  and  expected  outputs  are  in  Supplementary \nAppendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $8.75 million, of which $7 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the UCCRTF7 under the Urban Financing Partnership Facility and administered by \nADB. The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation,  studies  and  surveys  already  conducted,  and  other  in-kind  contributions \nincluding taxes and duties, if any. The value of the government contribution is estimated to \naccount for 20% of the total TA cost. \n \n13.  The TA will finance the cost of expert services and related operational activities including \ntraining and development, but will not include pilot testing. The scope of assistance complies \nwith the principles outlined in para. 3 of the Staff Instruction on Due Diligence and Reporting \nRequirements for Technical Assistance.8 \n \n                                                \n6   Feasibility studies for investment projects will include ADB safeguards due diligence. \n7  Financing partners: the Rockefeller Foundation and the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States. \n8 ADB.  2013.

The Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) of the Ministry of Finance is the executing \nagency of the TA. A TA steering committee, chaired by DEA, will be constituted and comprise \nthe country director of ADB\u2019s India Resident Mission, sector directors of ADB\u2019s South Asia \nDepartment (SARD) or sector specialists, the project officer of the TA, and representatives of \nthe relevant ministries and states, as required. The steering committee will screen and endorse \nsubproject proposals for further ADB processing and review overall status of TA implementation. \nTA subprojects will be approved by the SARD director general as and when they are ready to \nbe  implemented.  Ministries  and  states  selected  for  TA  support  will  be  the  implementing \nagencies for the respective TA subprojects. Implementing agencies will support TA subproject \ndesigns and day-to-day implementation, including government coordination. The TA and its \nsubprojects are expected to be implemented from November 2015 to September 2018. \n \n15.  SARD\u2019s  Urban  Development  and  Water  Division  (SAUW)  will  be  the  principal \nadministrator of the TA responsible for overall coordination. Respective project officers will be \nresponsible for managing and delivering relevant outputs under TA subprojects, including (i) \nrecruitment and management of consultants, (ii) implementation oversight, (iii) accountability for \nthe outputs, and (iv) reporting and communicating with stakeholders. Disbursements under the \nTA will be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, \nas amended from time to time). \n \n16.  Each TA subproject will require a team of international and national consultants to be \nengaged  separately.  Indicative  cost  estimates  for  consulting  services  were  prepared  in \nconsultation with project officers of the TA subprojects. However, these are indicative and \nestimates  will  be  finalized  in  consultation  with  the  government  during  follow-up  missions. \nSimilarly, the requisite fields of expertise (detailed in Appendix 3) will also be finalized during \nfollow-up missions and reflected in the individual TA subproject proposals. \n \n17.  Firms (or consortia of firms) and/or individual consultants will be recruited based on the \nrequirements of each TA subproject. Consulting firms will be engaged following the quality- and \ncost-based selection method, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 using full or simplified technical \nproposal  procedures,  consultant\u2019s  qualification  selection,  or  fixed  budget  selection,  as \nappropriate. Individual consultants will be selected using the individual consultant\u2019s selection \nmethod, and will be engaged to provide specialized technical and administrative inputs to fulfill \nADB due diligence requirements and enhance project readiness. Recruitment of all consultants \nunder the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time). Lump-sum or output-based contracts will be considered \nfor consulting services under the TA consistent with ADB\u2019s Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 \nAction Plan (actions 2.9.2 and 2.10.2) to reduce administrative burden and improve economy, \nefficiency, and value for money.9  \n \nE.  Governance \n18.  The TA implementation team will consist of SARD sector and resident mission staff and \nTA  consultants  with  sector  and  urban  climate  change  resilience  expertise.  The  TA \nimplementation team will regularly communicate TA progress to ADB Management, the DEA, \nand UCCRTF financing partners. The TA will be monitored through regular internal ADB review \nmeetings and  timely delivery of quality outputs. Overall TA results will be disseminated through \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 Action Plan. Manila (as updated periodically). \n ", "5 \nADB\u2019s  website.  Annual  audit  reports  will  be  prepared  in  accordance  with  the  UCCRTF \nimplementation guidelines. \n \n19.  The DEA is the nodal agency for ADB on all lending and nonlending projects, including \nthose being implemented by central ministries and state governments and those of central \npublic sector undertakings and financial institutions. All government agencies wishing to avail \nthemselves of external assistance are required to prepare proposals and forward them to the \nDEA for approval. The DEA ensures all foreign assistance supports the government\u2019s priorities, \nand receives budgetary and administrative clearances at appropriate stages. \n \n20.  ADB provided two cluster TA projects to the Government of India with the DEA (in 2006 \nand 2009) as an executing agency. The first cluster TA was financed by the Department for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom for $15 million and supported 24 cluster TA \nsubprojects.10 The ADB Board of Directors approved a request for a waiver of the inclusion of \nproject preparatory TA under that cluster TA. The TA completion report rated the cluster TA \nsuccessful, the performance of the executing agency and implementing agencies was rated \nsatisfactory,  and  achieving  outcomes  and  impacts  was  rated  highly  effective.  The  DEA \nexpressed  tremendous  appreciation  for  this  modality.  The  subsequent  Department  for \nInternational Development\u2013ADB Partnership for India (2009\u20132013) covered the ongoing cluster \nTA for Advanced Project Preparedness for Poverty Reduction with an overall allocation of $22 \nmillion in two phases.11 It comprised a total of 30 TA subprojects and was extended up to \nDecember 2015. The cluster TA facilitates enhanced project preparedness of ADB-supported \nprojects, especially in lagging states and pro-poor sectors. It reduced the need for stand-alone \nTA and increased the government\u2019s ownership of follow-up projects. The TA projects improved \nthe quality and delivery of ADB\u2019s assistance program for India. Cluster TA subprojects were \nselected to ensure representation of the poorest states or pro-poor activity sectors. Considering \nthe positive experience of past cluster TA projects with the DEA as an executing agency, the \ndepartment is well positioned to serve this role for the proposed TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n21.  The President recommends that the Board approve (i) ADB administering the cluster \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $7,000,000 to the Government of India to \nbe financed on a grant basis by the Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund under the \nUrban Financing Partnership Facility for Strengthening Climate Change Resilience in Urban \nIndia; and (ii) in respect of the cluster technical assistance, the waiver of the policy concerning \nexclusion of project preparatory technical assistance, as proposed in paragraph 8 of this report. \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2006.

The consultancy will be multipronged, with various components being implemented in \nparallel as follows: \n \n1.  Output  1:  Climate  Change  Resilience  in  Urban  Policies  and  Plans \nMainstreamed \n \na.  Institutional and Policy Support \n \n(i)  Assist  the  Ministry  of  Urban  Development  (MOUD)  and/or  states  or  related \nagencies to set up advisory groups related to urban resilience. Support MOUD in \nbuilding partnerships to draw knowledge from academic institutions and think \ntanks,  maximize  dissemination,  and  ensure  scientific  consensus  (e.g.,  Asian \nCities Climate Change Resilience Network). \n(ii)  Devise a draft implementation strategy and action plan to enable delivery of \nclimate-change-resilient city goals by MOUD in selected states and cities. On this \nbasis, finalize the plan and prepare a work program outlining required resources \nat various implementation levels. Support MOUD in presenting and securing \napproval for the work program and its rollout. \n(iii)  Building on MOUD strategic documents and the new flagship missions of the \ngovernment to assess whether revisions to original documentation are required, \nreflect  climate  change  resilience,  and  ensure  consistency  and  maximize \nsynergies among programs. \n(iv)  Prepare advisories and implementing guidelines to enhance and mainstream \nresilience and adaptation covering all urban infrastructure areas, including areas \nfor mainstreaming climate proofing, under MOUD guidance at the state level. \n(v)  Comprehensively assess and select policy instruments which collectively may \npromote urban climate change resilience. Partial variations may apply across the \ncountry given its vast breadth. Conduct consultations with other stakeholders, \nincluding  other  National  Action  Plan  for  Climate  Change  agencies,  National \nSustainable Habitat Mission focal agencies, states and cities, and think tanks. \nEnsure active participation of women in the decision-making process. \n(vi)  Disseminate  information  on  TA  implementation  to  central,  state,  and  local \ngovernment departments and agencies; communities; the private sector; and \ndevelopment partners. \n \nb.  Technical Assistance Implementation \n \nProvide  TA  management  and  implementation  support  to  the  Department  of \nEconomic  Affairs,  MOUD,  and  states  or  cities  through  TA  management, \nmonitoring, and reporting. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \nc.  Technical Assistance Evaluation \n \n(i)  Based  on  the  above  key  steps,  develop  a  program  performance  monitoring \nsystem and build a smart platform for communications with clear accountability \nmechanisms at all levels. \n(ii)  Set up model reporting and baseline forms for preparation at the local level and \nconsolidation by MOUD. Assist MOUD with consolidation and reporting at the \nnational level. \n(iii)  Prepare guidelines for program evaluation at the state level upon completion \n(including recommendations for climate proofing). Assist MOUD in preparing an \nevaluation report for the entire mission in early 2018. \n(iv)  Extract  lessons  from  TA  implementation  and  provide  recommendations  for \nscaling up and replication in selected states or cities of India. \n \nd.  City Climate-Change-Resilient Action Plans \n \n3.  The consultant will deliver urban climate-change-resilient action plans for at least five \ncities to be finalized in agreement with ADB and the Government of India. 2 These plans should \nbe integrated, to the extent possible, into existing city plans including upcoming programs and \nprojects to be supported by ADB.3 In doing so, the consultant will do the following: \n(i)  Stakeholder  engagement.  Conduct  institutional  and  sector  analyses  and \nstakeholder  consultations,  particularly  in  understanding  how  the  city  works, \nexamining its current status, and future trends (such as population growth and \neconomic development). Apply known processes and tools for building urban \nclimate change resilience. Ensure active participation of women in the decision-\nmaking process. \n(ii)  Climate  scenario  and  impact  assessment.  Conduct  risk  and  vulnerability \nassessments  (sex-disaggregated  and  gender-related)  based  on  exposure, \nhazard or disaster frequency and intensity, level of preparedness, infrastructure \nadaptation.  Climate  projections  will  be  used  to  determine  direct  and  indirect \nclimate impacts. This process will involve collecting and analyzing data related to \nthe following: \n(a)  Hydrometeorology and hydrogeology. Assess these factors (e.g., river \nand sea levels, river flow, rainfall, cyclone frequency and intensity, storm \nsurges, river and urban flooding, temperature, groundwater extraction, \nand  water  salinity)  and  the  outputs  of  various  modeling  results  and \nanalyses in the target areas. Review and assess projections of future \nwater withdrawal upstream. Utilize reliable secondary data as much as \npossible. Assess plausible climate scenarios (sea-level rise, increased \nintensity of rainfall and cyclones, storm surges) for 2030 and 2050. While \nanalyzing  the  data  and  simulation  results  available,  including  the \nscenarios  prepared  in  the  fifth  assessment  report  of  the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, make the best professional \njudgment  in  assessing  future  climate  scenarios.  Prepare  at  least  two \nscenarios.  Prepare  digital  maps  of  the  assessment  results  using \ngeographic information system (GIS) technology. The GIS-based digital \n                                                \n2  Cities will be selected based on a multipronged approach combining (i) climate change exposure and vulnerability, \n(ii) urban local body willingness and commitment to climate change resilience, (iii) implementation readiness, (iv) \nADB\u2019s presence in the state, (v) government priorities and implementing capacity, and  (v) coordination with \ndevelopment partners.   \n3  Consultants should refer to ADB publication on urban climate change resilience. \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nmap will show flooded areas and duration, salinity intrusion, and other \nimpacts of climate change under various model results. \n(b)  Existing infrastructure and future plans for extending and/or upgrading \nclimate-resilient city urban infrastructure including water supply, sanitation \nand  sewerage  structures,  storm  water  drainage,  power  supply,  street \nlights,  transport,  pedestrian  environments.  Data  to  be  collected  can \ninclude the type, location, and capacity of water supply; drainage and \nwastewater  treatment  assets;  water  service  coverage;  and  sewage \ndisposal and sanitation systems coverage. \n(c)  Collect available socioeconomic and physical data, including population \ndensity; population trends; the location of slums; damage caused by past \nextreme weather events; and data related to public health, such as the \nincidence  of  disease  related  to  extreme  weather  events,  such  as \nwaterborne  diseases.  Data to  be  collected  on physical  characteristics \ninclude topography, land use, and land subsidence. Collect historical and \nprojected  data  and,  where  data  are  insufficient,  take  actual \nmeasurements as needed. \n(d)  Review urban land-use plans, policies, and current local practices for \ncoping with climate variability and extreme weather events, such as early \nwarning systems and evacuation planning. \n(e)  Assess social and economic impacts on water supply, sanitation, and \nsewage  and  drainage  systems,  both  qualitatively  and  quantitatively, \nincluding their public health implications and impacts on the poor. \n(iii)  Vulnerability assessment. Vulnerability assessments (sex-disaggregated and \ngender-related) will determine those populations within the city which will face \nhigh  exposure  and  risk  to  climate  impacts,  and  which  have  limited  coping \ncapacity to manage these impacts. Identify hotspots and key opportunities for \nresilience building. \n(iv)  Determine  investment  requirements  and  costs  for  building  resilience. \nBased  on  the  vulnerability  assessment,  identify  structural  and  nonstructural \noptions to build resilience while considering resilient city principles. This process \nwill require the identification of the infrastructure investment requirements for \nfuture  ADB  support.  Consultants  should  utilize  proven  methodologies  in \ndetermining this requirement in consultation with various institutions working in \nthis area (National Institute of Urban Affairs, Rockefeller Foundation). Provide \noptions on the bases of a review and analysis of international best practices and \nproposed  potential  adaptation  interventions  such  as  the  implementation  of \nprotection measures, changes in land use, emergency response mechanisms, \nand strengthening the regulatory framework. Consider, for example, relocating \nthe  intake  of  the  proposed  water  treatment  plant,  assessing  the  abstracted \nvolume of groundwater, optimizing the design of drainage systems, and selecting \nthe  location  of  sanitation  facilities.  Make  a  preliminary  assessment  of  the \nfeasibility  of  each  option,  with  due  consideration  of  effectiveness,  urgency, \nassociated benefits and costs, and social acceptability; and identify the agencies \nresponsible for implementation. Analyze the pros and cons of each proposed \nintervention and preferred options through a participatory approach. \n(v)  City  resilience  strategy  development.  Prepare  a  city-level  climate-change-\nresilience strategy, including aspects of improved risk preparedness and disaster \nrisk management. Consider recommendations in areas such as social resilience, \nland use planning, urban ecosystems and upgrading, and integration of resilience \nin  the  project  cycle.  In  all  cases,  assess  the  application  and  relevance  of \n ", "Appendix 3  13 \ninformation and communications technology-based systems (global positioning \nsystem-enabled, GIS). \n(vi)  Prepare  city-level  action  plans.  Prepare  city-level  action  plans  for \nmainstreaming climate resilience, considering the following areas: (a) water cycle \nmanagement,  (b)  low-carbon  transport,  (c)  energy  management  (including \nenergy  efficiency  in  buildings  and  street  lighting,  emergency  power  supply \nsystems,  (d)  communications,  and  (e)  other  city  services  (e.g.,  solid-waste \nmanagement). The city-level action plan should comprehensively tackle policy, \ninstitutional, and resourcing in addition to infrastructure provision. \n \n2.  Output  2:  Climate  Change  Resilience  of  Infrastructure  and  Project \nDevelopment Supported \n \n4.  A key activity of the TA is support for project scoping, and preparation for scaling up \nsuch plans to fill infrastructure and service delivery deficits so as to build urban resilience \nthrough future ADB support. Consultants will deliver prefeasibility studies and feasibility studies \nfor selected cities covering areas of urban climate change resilience.4 \n \n3.  Output 3: Institutional Capacity, Community Awareness, and Knowledge \nfor Sustaining Climate-Change-Resilient Cities Strengthened \n5.  The TA will prepare and deliver capacity building and education programs for various \nstakeholders (city managers, population, women\u2019s groups). Training programs will target mainly \nkey central, state, and local government officials to improve their capacity for assessing and \nresponding to climate change impacts and risks, and include the following activities: \n(i)  Plan and conduct training programs and workshops for key stakeholders to raise \nawareness of and develop skills for better adapting to climate change. \n(ii)  Disseminate  information  on  TA  implementation  to  relevant  central  and  local \ngovernment departments and agencies, communities, the private sector, and \ndevelopment partners. Ensure effective participation and conduct workshops in \nDelhi and selected states and/or cities. \n(iii)  Ensure that information and education for the community (under output 4) is \napplied equally to men and women of different groups. This may imply using \ndifferent messages, channels of communication, and languages depending on \nfactors such as education level. \n(iv)  Incorporate environmental and social safeguards into urban planning. \n(v)  Provide recommendations for further capacity building and awareness raising \nprograms. \n(vi)  Develop  at  least  one  knowledge  product  highlighting  lessons  learned  in  the \ndevelopment of urban resilience in India. \n(vii)  Evaluate  capacity  building  programs  undertaken  during  the TA, and  prepare \nfuture programs to be carried out during the implementation of priority actions. \n(viii)  Prepare printed and web-based knowledge and communication materials with \nrecommendations for scaling up and replication in other areas of India. \n(ix)  Design city twinning partnerships for peer-to-peer learning and operationalize \nthem. \n(x)  Organize and execute foreign exposure visits related to urban resilience which \nmay be replicated using the Indian context. \n                                                \n4  Studies will include safeguards due diligence in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). \n "], "metadata": {"Author": "Asian Development Bank", "CreationDate": "D:20151013174950+08'00'", "Creator": "PDF24 Creator", "Keywords": "49106, india, r106-15, cluster ta, uccrtf, urban climate change resilience trust fund, climate change, flood protection, energy efficiency, sustainable transport system, sustainable water management, adb technical assistance, approved technical assistance, adb technical assistance ta report", "ModDate": "D:20151106111823+08'00'", "Producer": "GPL Ghostscript 9.16", "Subject": "Technical Assistance Report", "Title": "49106-001: Strengthening Climate Change Resilience in Urban India"}, "author_page": " \n \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 30 September 2015) \nCurrency unit  \u2013  Indian rupee/s (Re/Rs) \nRe1.00  =  $0.015 \n$1.00  =  Rs65.934 \n \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  DEA  \u2013  Department of Economic Affairs \n  GDP  \u2013  gross domestic product \n  GIS  \u2013  geographic information system \n  MOUD  \u2013  Ministry of Urban Development \n  SARD  \u2013  South Asia Department \n  SAUW  \u2013  Urban Development and Water Division \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n  UCCRTF  \u2013  Urban Climate Change Resilience Trust Fund \n \n \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \nVice-President  W.
