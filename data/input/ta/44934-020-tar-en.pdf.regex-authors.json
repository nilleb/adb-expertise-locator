The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee \nProgram (MFP) is a credit-enhancement initiative designed to address market gaps by sharing \nrisks to facilitate local currency lending to low-income people, predominantly women. With a \nprogram limit of $340 million that is operationalized on a revolving basis, the MFP has supported \n$1.15 billion in new local currency loans since its inception, benefiting almost 6 million borrowers, \nmostly women, across ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs). \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n2.  The peri-urban and urban poor often reside in densely populated settlements, bearing the \nbrunt of poor housing conditions that are highly vulnerable to climate change-induced extreme \nweather  events.1 This  situation  is  compounded  by  deteriorating  access  to  basic  services, \nespecially water and sanitation.2 Furthermore, given the geographical locations and their lower \nlevel of economic activity and prosperity, resources and institutional capacities in these locations \nare often limited. In many instances, interventions made by the government are inadequate and \naffordable commercial solutions are rare. There is an opportunity to build the resilience of \nhouseholds by funding home improvements and improved access to water and sanitation services \nthrough affordable, commercially structured solutions. In Bangladesh, for example, the estimated \nannual demand for urban housing microfinance is BDT 17.27 billion ($0.22 billion).3  The capital \nrequired for home improvements and safe water and sewage connections is typically provided by \nmicrofinance  institutions  (MFIs)  via  group-based  lending.  Collective  decision-making  within \nneighborhoods also helps build resilience in the urban communities. \n \n3.  A  critical  condition  for  financing  home  improvements  is  an  existing  well-functioning \nmicrofinance channel. MFIs are usually well-placed to cover the targeted population. While \nwholesale banks have the resources to support these activities, constraints at both the partner \nfinancial  institution  (PFI)4 and  MFI  levels  impede  these  entities  from  contributing  to  more \nsignificant outcomes. These constraints relate to: (i) PFIs\u2019 inability to assess and review the risks \nassociated with long-term loans; and (ii) MFIs\u2019 limited technical and operational capacities to \nstructure appropriate loan products, work with the micro-borrowers to budget the capital outlay, \nand oversee the design, material-sourcing, and construction activities. There is also significant \nrisk aversion at both the PFI and MFI operating levels in the absence of technical support and \nsystematic hand-holding from the loan product design to the demand assessment and market \nmapping, and the final scaling-up stage. \n \n4.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) will help the MFP continue to address market \ngaps while strengthening financing for upgrading housing and access to water supply and \nsanitation  through  the  provision  of  loan  loss  guarantees  targeting  these  micro-home \n \n1  United Nations Climate Change. The hazardous areas are typically the low-lying areas, which are prone to flooding \nor  coastal  erosion  and  are  often  without  access  to  in-house  permanent  access  to  clear  water  and \nsanitation. https://unfccc.int/climate-action/momentum-for-change/urban-poor.  \n2  United Nations Human Rights Office of the High Commissioner.

The TA will target disaster-prone peri-urban settlements in Bangladesh, \nIndonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, the Philippines, and Vietnam. The TA will also provide MFP with \nfunds to conduct institutional strengthening of participating MFIs that will include knowledge \ndissemination, beneficiary training, formulation of enabling policies, and progress monitoring. The \nproposed TA addresses bottlenecks by providing first-loss guarantees on loans that PFIs extend \nto MFIs specifically targeted at these micro-home improvements and by engaging reputable \ntechnical partners to work with MFIs to build their skills for delivering such loans to target \nbeneficiaries. \n \n5.  Component 1. First Loss Guarantee. The first loss guarantee funded by the TA will \ncover up to 10% of the principal of eligible loans provided by PFIs to qualified MFIs for specific \npurposes. The remaining 90% of the loan (the senior risk) will be shared equally between the PFI \nand the ADB MFP. The first loss guarantee will build on the MFP platform, which has already \nestablished  significant  outreach  to  PFIs  and  MFIs  in  the  target  countries.  With  this \ncomplementarity, the first loss guarantee is expected to rapidly generate significant leverage by \nexpanding the PFIs\u2019 risk tolerance towards longer-term financing to MFIs. This will also incentivize \nMFIs to provide affordable longer tenor micro-housing loans to the targeted households5 and \nimprove the asset-liability management of the MFIs. \n \n6.  Component 2. Institutional Strengthening of MFIs. The TA will also provide capacity \nbuilding to MFIs covering: (i) product development, market-scoping and project planning; (ii) \ntraining of MFI staff; (iii) establishing guidelines for climate-resilient model housing and materials; \nand (iv) creating local language content knowledge-dissemination and training materials. The \nsuccessful delivery of the long-term micro housing loans requires an MFI to structure appropriate \nlending products and improve its interface with the beneficiaries by covering the capital outlay \nand technical design, material-sourcing, construction of the home unit and water and sanitation \nfacilities within realistic debt service targets.  \n \n7.  ADB will engage the consulting services of an experienced consulting firm (technical \npartners to provide technical advice for participating MFIs). Qualified organizations include but \nare not limited to the following organizations: World Habitat, Build Change, Habitat for Humanity, \nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, SKAT Consulting Ltd., and \nGawad Kalinga. Required expertise includes detailed market mapping, loan product design, roll-\nout of appropriate policies, training of MFI loan officers in budgeting, development of standardized \nlocal language content for micro-housing activities, and project monitoring and evaluation to \ncomplement the outreach of selected qualified MFIs. ADB will also explore the possibility of \nobtaining cofinancing through a challenge selection process of technical partners.  \n \n8.  The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 supporting three of its operational priorities. \nThe first loss guarantee component addresses poverty reduction. The TA creates an enabling \nenvironment for microfinance to promote access to finance for the poor and foster inclusive \ngrowth. In the area of gender equality, the TA incorporates guiding principles for MFIs to be \nsupportive  of  women  inclusion  and  protection.  Integrating  climate  change  adaptation  in \nmicrofinance  demonstrates  focus  on  building  climate  and  disaster  reliance  and  enhancing \nenvironmental sustainability. \n \n \n5  While the housing assets do only generate cash inflows via borrower cost savings over the medium-term, longer \nmaturity loans (ranging from 24-26 months) are required to meet the borrowers\u2019 debt service capacity.  \n ", "3 \nB.

As the first loss guarantee is a contingent claim and there is no certainty that ADB will \nneed to pay out under the obligation, the unutilized funds will be re-deployed in these specified end-uses; on a \nrevolving basis. In order to have proper tracking, reporting, and end-usage control and oversight, these funds will be \nset aside in the Catalytic Fund, which will be maintained by ADB. \n ", "4 \nhousing/home-improvement  targeted  loans  provided  by  PFIs;  and  (ii)  microfinance  related \noutreach and capacity building from the non-utilized (and the post-default recovery) portion of the \nTA.
