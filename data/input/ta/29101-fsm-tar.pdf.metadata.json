INTRODUCTION\n1. At the request of the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia\n(Government), the Bank agreed to provide technical assistance (TA) to strengthen\nagricultural support services at the national and federal levels. A Bank Fact-Finding\nMission visited the four states of FSM from 2 May to 29 May 1995 and reached an\nunderstanding with the federal and state governments regarding the objectives, scope,\nterms of reference, and implementation and financing arrangements for the TA. This TA\nReport was prepared on the basis of the findings of the Mission and the understandings\nreached with the Government1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) consists of the four states of\nChuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap; the federal capital is located on Pohnpei. The country\nis more than 2,900 kilometers (km) wide, and includes over 600 individual islands spread\nacross more than 2.5 million square km (km 2) of ocean in the Northern Pacific. The total\nland area is 700 km2; Pohnpei has nearly half the total land area, with the rest almost\nequally divided between the other three states. The population was estimated at 105,500\nin 1994, with a net annual growth rate of only 1 percent; however, significant out-\nmigration takes place. FSM was part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific administered by\nthe United States (US) from 1946 until 1986 when the US relinquished its trusteeship and\nFSM became a self-governing nation. After independence, the US continued to provide\ngrant aid through an arrangement known as the Compact of Free Association (the\nCompact).\n3. The federal and state governments have prepared outline strategies for\ndeveloping the agriculture, livestock, and forestry sectors in the short and medium term,\nparticularly after the cessation of funding under the Compact in the year 2001. The grant\naid received through the Compact is channelled through the public sector for a wide\nrange of uses such as capital improvements, operations, public sector salaries, and\nsocial services. The public sector is the most significant employer. It provides about 25\npercent of total employment, and, by virtue of its size, creates high levels of demand for\nimported goods, including food products. In 1993, imports totaled $109.5 million\ncompared with total exports of $34.2 million, of which $25.2 million was exports of fish.\nFood imports totaled $31.2 million in 1993, or 29 percent of total imports, whereas\nagricultural exports amounted to only $1 .7 million.\n4. The agriculture sector provides the greatest opportunity for employment\n(48 percent of total employment in 1989). However, the rigid land tenure system and\nfarm family structures affect attitudes to investment and the ability to acquire land. The\nrestrictive land tenure systems combined with a high population density determine the\npredominance of subsistence agriculture, together with some semicommercial farming.\nThe generally favorable temperatures and rainfall combined with the adequate, shallow\nsoils on the high islands provide suitable conditions for the production of a wide variety\nof crops, such as breadfruits, taro, yam, coconut, banana, papaya, and a range of other\nfruit trees, usually grown under traditional agro-forestry techniques. However,\nincreasingly, the upper slopes of the hilly volcanic islands are used for production which\nThe TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in March 1995.", "2\ndamages the watersheds. The conditions on the low-lying sandy atolls of Chuuk,\nPohnpei, and Yap states are much harsher than on the high islands, with poor, thin soils,\nand a limited water supply. Traditional production on the atolls also consists of\nbreadfruit, taro, coconut, and bananas, but production levels are much more susceptible\nto weather variations than on the high islands, including dry spells and typhoons, and\nsaline toxicity following occasional intrusions by the sea.\n5. Despite the limitations of land availability and farm size, the existence of\na subsistence market surplus and semicommercial production of local crops such as\nbanana, betel nut, citrus, sakau1, and to a lesser extent taro, are examples of\nsuccessfully expanded and private sector-driven production and trade. In addition, there\nis significant unmet local demand for other commodities including fruits and vegetables\nfor the urban centers, restaurants, and hotels that presently depend largely on imports\nfor their supplies. The availability of, and dependence on, relatively cheap and\nconvenient imported foods in all the states has had an undesirable impact on the national\nnutritional status. There has been a marked rise in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)\nfollowing the development of preferences for nutritionally inferior imported foods (e.g.\ncanned fish and meats, and poor quality frozen poultry products), coupled with changing\nattitudes and lifestyles.\n6. Federal and state government polices and strategies in both the First and\nSecond National Development Plans (NDP),1985-1996, placed a high priority on\nimproving subsistence and semicommercial production and self-sufficiency by increasing\nthe production of selected cash crops and livestock. Attention is given to improving\nnutritional status by increasing the supply of fresh food products in local markets. Market\ndevelopment is to be supported through the selective development of small-scale\nprocessing and packaging enterprises, and improvements to the storage and\ntransportation of produce. State governments are also responsible for fostering the\ndevelopment of selected products through tariff and import quota protection. Export\npromotion is to be encouraged through the provision of improved information on export\nmarket opportunities and the improvement of quarantine services.\n7. Many of the policies and strategies described in the Second NDP remain\nrelevant, but have been only partially addressed as the end of the plan period\napproaches in 1996. Development plans prepared by the individual states are generally\nambitious, and in the absence of operational plan details, except for externally financed\nprojects, expected outputs are often unclear. In all states there is an increasing concern\nto ensure greater self-sufficiency before the end of the Compact. Specific measures and\nprograms require elaboration, including the identification of commodity emphasis and\nappropriate approaches. The expansion of commercial production for export is a second\npriority; in those cases where exports have succeeded, the emphasis has been on\nproduction aspects, and consideration for marketing requirements has been limited.\nMost exports have focussed on the Guam market and are subject to United States\nDepartment of Agriculture quarantine regulations.\nPiper methysticum, known as \"kava\" in the South Pacific.", "3\n8. Policy and strategy implementation is the responsibility of the Department\nof Resources and Development (DRD), Agriculture Division, at the federal level, and\nrespective agriculture departments (ADs) at the state level. The structures, size and\nfunctions of the ADs vary between states. In all cases the ADs are responsible for crop\nand livestock production extension and research, forestry, and quarantine services. A\nfew staff at management level have received degree training in general agriculture, but\nvery few have specialist training in areas such as veterinary science, entomology, plant\npathology or soil science. The sections of the department are headed by a supervisor\nwho usually has diploma training from a regional college, and may have had some\nsupplementary short-term overseas training. Each section has technical specialists\n(typically agriculturalists and livestock specialists), extension agents, extension aides and\nother support staff. State AD access to broad-based technical information and relevant\nresearch results and new approaches is mainly limited to that provided by externally\nsupported projects with resident or visiting advisory staff. Combined with the fairly low\nlevel of extension agents' technical skills, the service is generally reactive in nature, and\ncash crop orientated. The Department of Commerce and Industry (DCI) in each state is\nresponsible for assessing the business, processing, and market promotion aspects of\nagricultural products, including the preparation of business profiles and plans\nincorporating farm budgets.\n9. A range of externally supported and nongovernment efforts to support\nagriculture are being implemented and address specific issues. Among others, the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) -financed Integrated Atoll Development\nProject, completed in 1991, promoted, among other components, integrated community-\nbased food production systems. The Bank-financed Community Watershed Management\nProject1 has achieved a significant impact in promoting watershed protection through\ncommunity based management of the upland forests.\nll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n10. The objective of the TA is to promote economic self-reliance and growth\nin FSM, arising out of the need for increased food production and productivity for self\nsufficiency and export, and to strengthen the capacity of the Government agricultural\nsupport services. The TA will: (i) focus services on viable agricultural commodities to\nincrease self sufficiency, \u00e7enerate surpluses for sale on the domestic market, import\nsubstitution and export; (ii) improve access to market information; (iii) enhance the\nextension approaches used to support production for self-sufficiency and increase\nmarketable surpluses; (iv) upgrade the skiHs of station and extension staff to more\neffectively support subsistence, semicommercial and fully commercial producers; (v)\nimprove farmers' access to technical information and FSM nongovernment agricultural\nservice resources, and; (vi) streamline the operational planning of existing agricultural\nsupport services including promoting greater integration with nongovernment services.\nUnder TA No. 2PSM: Watershed Monagemont and Environment. for 585.00O, approved fl", "4\nB.\t Scope\n11. The scope of the TA will involve: (I) examining the policy environment and\nother factors which limit the role of the private sector in agricultural production and\nmarketing; (ii) identifying agricultural commodities produced from surplus subsistence,\nsemi or fully commercial sources which are financially and economically feasible\nsubstitutes for imports and which have potential as competitive exports, and also\nidentifying potential export destinations; (iii) identifying constraints and requirements for\nmarketing, processing, transport and import at destination; (iv) establishing a basic\nmarket information system; (v) introducing or replicating successful extension approaches\nfor targeting and involving subsistence and semicomrnercal producers in crop and\nlivestock development including the eftective involvement of communities and women in\nagricultural development; (vi) identifying, developing and delivering training programs for\nstation and extension stall in key technical topics, extension methods, and program\ndelivery and management: (vii) identifying FSM and international sources of relevant\ntechnical information and establishing a functional system for delivering and responding\nto department information needs; (viii) promoting linkages and involvement with\nnongovernment agricultural research, extension and training related services and other\nlocal resources; (ix) examining the potential for promoting private sector extension\nservices, and the willingness of farmers of farmers groups to pay for such services, and;\n(x) supporting operational planning within the ADs.\nC\t Cost Estimate and Financing Plan\n12. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $598,000 equivalent, comprising\n$486,000 in foreign exchange and $112,000 in local cost. The Bank will finance $560,000\nequivalent of the cost on a grant basis, including the total foreign exchange costs of the\nconsultant services and one vehicle1, computers and other equipment, and $74,000\nequivalent of the local costs, mainly training expenses. The TA will be charged to the\nBank-funded TA program. The Government will finance the remaining $38,000 equivalent\nof the local currency costs, consisting of counterpart and secretarial staff, office supplies,\nfarm equipment operation and maintenance, provision of labor for demonstrations and\ntrials, domestic travel for counterpart staff, and domestic communications. The cost\nestimates are set out in detail in Appendix 1.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n13. The TA will be implemented over 18 months, commencing in April 1996\nand ending in November 1997. It will require the services of two individual consultants\nwith expertise in agricultural economics and marketing for 8 person-months, and\nagricultural extension for 10 person-months, for a total of 18 person-months. The\nagricultural economics and marketing specialist, who will be the team leader, will\ninvestigate production and market aspects and will initiate the establishment of a basic\nmarket information system and support federal and state project operational planning.\nThe agricultural extension specialist will review approaches to extension, and design and\ndeliver training that builds on successfully applied approaches within the FSM, as well\nBecause of the long duration of the TA, a vehicle will be purchased rather than hired.", "5\nas supervise field implementation. The training programs will encourage the involvement\nof FSM institutions in building a local training capacity for the ADs. The extension\nspecialist will also support extension program management and the improvement of\ncoordination between federal and state ADs, especially technical information flows. The\nconsultants will be engaged by the Bank on an individual basis and in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The detailed terms of reference for the\nconsultants are in Appendix 2.\n14. The Executing Agency for the TA will be the DRD at the federal level and\nthe Secretary of DAD will be responsible for coordinating its implementation. The\nconsultants will work with the AD of DRD, which will ensure the provision of counterpart\nstaff at the federal and state levels and the arrangements for working closely with\nagriculture staff including extension agents. In addition, DRD will facilitate collaboration\nwith the DCI at the Federal level and its equivalent in all states for the marketing studies.\n15. The TA will provide equipment, planting materials, training materials, and\ntraining funds. Items will be procured by the Executing Agency in accordance with\narrangements acceptable to the Bank. Provision will also be made for engaging third\nparty trainers at the discretion of the Executing Agency and the consultants in\naccordance with the Bank's procedures. The DAD and state ADs will be responsible for\nproviding relevant data and information for the consultants and will make the necessary\narrangements to facilitate their work.\n16. The agricultural economist, as the team leader, will prepare a report on the\nresults of the marketing investigation and market information system at the end of the first\nfour month assignment, and will return later on for a second four month assignment to\nsupport further work on the market information system and project operational planning.\nThe agricultural extension specialist will spend the first two months reviewing existing\ninformation on agricultural production and assessing existing extension approaches, and\nabout two months in each of the four states establishing improved approaches and\nmanaging and conducting in-service training. The precise timing and duration of each\ninput will be reviewed as the TA progresses, and may be amended as necessary and as\nagreed by the Executing Agency, the consultants, and the Bank.\n17. The impact of the TA will be measured by assessing the degree of\nutilization of the agricultural commodity market information by producers and Government\nplanners, and the establishment and utilization by support services and staff of extension\napproaches that more effectively motivate communities and producers to produce for\nself-sufficiency, surpluses for the local market, import substitution, and export where\nviable.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n18. The President, acting under the authority delegated to him by the Board,\nhas approved the provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government\nof the Federated States of Micronesia in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$560,000 for the purpose of the Strengthening of Agricultural Support Services Project,\nand hereby reports his action to the Board.", "\t\t\t\t\n\t\n6\nAppendix 1\nDETAILED COST ESTIMATES\n($)\nItem\t Foreign Local Total\nCost Cost Cost\nA.

INTRODUCTION\n1. At the request of the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia\n(Government), the Bank agreed to provide technical assistance (TA) to strengthen\nagricultural support services at the national and federal levels. A Bank Fact-Finding\nMission visited the four states of FSM from 2 May to 29 May 1995 and reached an\nunderstanding with the federal and state governments regarding the objectives, scope,\nterms of reference, and implementation and financing arrangements for the TA. This TA\nReport was prepared on the basis of the findings of the Mission and the understandings\nreached with the Government1.\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) consists of the four states of\nChuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, and Yap; the federal capital is located on Pohnpei. The country\nis more than 2,900 kilometers (km) wide, and includes over 600 individual islands spread\nacross more than 2.5 million square km (km 2) of ocean in the Northern Pacific. The total\nland area is 700 km2; Pohnpei has nearly half the total land area, with the rest almost\nequally divided between the other three states. The population was estimated at 105,500\nin 1994, with a net annual growth rate of only 1 percent; however, significant out-\nmigration takes place. FSM was part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific administered by\nthe United States (US) from 1946 until 1986 when the US relinquished its trusteeship and\nFSM became a self-governing nation. After independence, the US continued to provide\ngrant aid through an arrangement known as the Compact of Free Association (the\nCompact).\n3. The federal and state governments have prepared outline strategies for\ndeveloping the agriculture, livestock, and forestry sectors in the short and medium term,\nparticularly after the cessation of funding under the Compact in the year 2001. The grant\naid received through the Compact is channelled through the public sector for a wide\nrange of uses such as capital improvements, operations, public sector salaries, and\nsocial services. The public sector is the most significant employer. It provides about 25\npercent of total employment, and, by virtue of its size, creates high levels of demand for\nimported goods, including food products. In 1993, imports totaled $109.5 million\ncompared with total exports of $34.2 million, of which $25.2 million was exports of fish.\nFood imports totaled $31.2 million in 1993, or 29 percent of total imports, whereas\nagricultural exports amounted to only $1 .7 million.\n4. The agriculture sector provides the greatest opportunity for employment\n(48 percent of total employment in 1989). However, the rigid land tenure system and\nfarm family structures affect attitudes to investment and the ability to acquire land. The\nrestrictive land tenure systems combined with a high population density determine the\npredominance of subsistence agriculture, together with some semicommercial farming.\nThe generally favorable temperatures and rainfall combined with the adequate, shallow\nsoils on the high islands provide suitable conditions for the production of a wide variety\nof crops, such as breadfruits, taro, yam, coconut, banana, papaya, and a range of other\nfruit trees, usually grown under traditional agro-forestry techniques. However,\nincreasingly, the upper slopes of the hilly volcanic islands are used for production which\nThe TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in March 1995.", "2\ndamages the watersheds. The conditions on the low-lying sandy atolls of Chuuk,\nPohnpei, and Yap states are much harsher than on the high islands, with poor, thin soils,\nand a limited water supply. Traditional production on the atolls also consists of\nbreadfruit, taro, coconut, and bananas, but production levels are much more susceptible\nto weather variations than on the high islands, including dry spells and typhoons, and\nsaline toxicity following occasional intrusions by the sea.\n5. Despite the limitations of land availability and farm size, the existence of\na subsistence market surplus and semicommercial production of local crops such as\nbanana, betel nut, citrus, sakau1, and to a lesser extent taro, are examples of\nsuccessfully expanded and private sector-driven production and trade. In addition, there\nis significant unmet local demand for other commodities including fruits and vegetables\nfor the urban centers, restaurants, and hotels that presently depend largely on imports\nfor their supplies. The availability of, and dependence on, relatively cheap and\nconvenient imported foods in all the states has had an undesirable impact on the national\nnutritional status. There has been a marked rise in noncommunicable diseases (NCDs)\nfollowing the development of preferences for nutritionally inferior imported foods (e.g.\ncanned fish and meats, and poor quality frozen poultry products), coupled with changing\nattitudes and lifestyles.\n6. Federal and state government polices and strategies in both the First and\nSecond National Development Plans (NDP),1985-1996, placed a high priority on\nimproving subsistence and semicommercial production and self-sufficiency by increasing\nthe production of selected cash crops and livestock. Attention is given to improving\nnutritional status by increasing the supply of fresh food products in local markets. Market\ndevelopment is to be supported through the selective development of small-scale\nprocessing and packaging enterprises, and improvements to the storage and\ntransportation of produce. State governments are also responsible for fostering the\ndevelopment of selected products through tariff and import quota protection. Export\npromotion is to be encouraged through the provision of improved information on export\nmarket opportunities and the improvement of quarantine services.\n7. Many of the policies and strategies described in the Second NDP remain\nrelevant, but have been only partially addressed as the end of the plan period\napproaches in 1996. Development plans prepared by the individual states are generally\nambitious, and in the absence of operational plan details, except for externally financed\nprojects, expected outputs are often unclear. In all states there is an increasing concern\nto ensure greater self-sufficiency before the end of the Compact. Specific measures and\nprograms require elaboration, including the identification of commodity emphasis and\nappropriate approaches. The expansion of commercial production for export is a second\npriority; in those cases where exports have succeeded, the emphasis has been on\nproduction aspects, and consideration for marketing requirements has been limited.\nMost exports have focussed on the Guam market and are subject to United States\nDepartment of Agriculture quarantine regulations.\nPiper methysticum, known as \"kava\" in the South Pacific.", "3\n8. Policy and strategy implementation is the responsibility of the Department\nof Resources and Development (DRD), Agriculture Division, at the federal level, and\nrespective agriculture departments (ADs) at the state level. The structures, size and\nfunctions of the ADs vary between states. In all cases the ADs are responsible for crop\nand livestock production extension and research, forestry, and quarantine services. A\nfew staff at management level have received degree training in general agriculture, but\nvery few have specialist training in areas such as veterinary science, entomology, plant\npathology or soil science. The sections of the department are headed by a supervisor\nwho usually has diploma training from a regional college, and may have had some\nsupplementary short-term overseas training. Each section has technical specialists\n(typically agriculturalists and livestock specialists), extension agents, extension aides and\nother support staff. State AD access to broad-based technical information and relevant\nresearch results and new approaches is mainly limited to that provided by externally\nsupported projects with resident or visiting advisory staff. Combined with the fairly low\nlevel of extension agents' technical skills, the service is generally reactive in nature, and\ncash crop orientated. The Department of Commerce and Industry (DCI) in each state is\nresponsible for assessing the business, processing, and market promotion aspects of\nagricultural products, including the preparation of business profiles and plans\nincorporating farm budgets.\n9. A range of externally supported and nongovernment efforts to support\nagriculture are being implemented and address specific issues. Among others, the\nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) -financed Integrated Atoll Development\nProject, completed in 1991, promoted, among other components, integrated community-\nbased food production systems. The Bank-financed Community Watershed Management\nProject1 has achieved a significant impact in promoting watershed protection through\ncommunity based management of the upland forests.\nll. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n10. The objective of the TA is to promote economic self-reliance and growth\nin FSM, arising out of the need for increased food production and productivity for self\nsufficiency and export, and to strengthen the capacity of the Government agricultural\nsupport services. The TA will: (i) focus services on viable agricultural commodities to\nincrease self sufficiency, \u00e7enerate surpluses for sale on the domestic market, import\nsubstitution and export; (ii) improve access to market information; (iii) enhance the\nextension approaches used to support production for self-sufficiency and increase\nmarketable surpluses; (iv) upgrade the skiHs of station and extension staff to more\neffectively support subsistence, semicommercial and fully commercial producers; (v)\nimprove farmers' access to technical information and FSM nongovernment agricultural\nservice resources, and; (vi) streamline the operational planning of existing agricultural\nsupport services including promoting greater integration with nongovernment services.\nUnder TA No. 2PSM: Watershed Monagemont and Environment. for 585.00O, approved fl", "4\nB.\t Scope\n11. The scope of the TA will involve: (I) examining the policy environment and\nother factors which limit the role of the private sector in agricultural production and\nmarketing; (ii) identifying agricultural commodities produced from surplus subsistence,\nsemi or fully commercial sources which are financially and economically feasible\nsubstitutes for imports and which have potential as competitive exports, and also\nidentifying potential export destinations; (iii) identifying constraints and requirements for\nmarketing, processing, transport and import at destination; (iv) establishing a basic\nmarket information system; (v) introducing or replicating successful extension approaches\nfor targeting and involving subsistence and semicomrnercal producers in crop and\nlivestock development including the eftective involvement of communities and women in\nagricultural development; (vi) identifying, developing and delivering training programs for\nstation and extension stall in key technical topics, extension methods, and program\ndelivery and management: (vii) identifying FSM and international sources of relevant\ntechnical information and establishing a functional system for delivering and responding\nto department information needs; (viii) promoting linkages and involvement with\nnongovernment agricultural research, extension and training related services and other\nlocal resources; (ix) examining the potential for promoting private sector extension\nservices, and the willingness of farmers of farmers groups to pay for such services, and;\n(x) supporting operational planning within the ADs.\nC\t Cost Estimate and Financing Plan\n12. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $598,000 equivalent, comprising\n$486,000 in foreign exchange and $112,000 in local cost. The Bank will finance $560,000\nequivalent of the cost on a grant basis, including the total foreign exchange costs of the\nconsultant services and one vehicle1, computers and other equipment, and $74,000\nequivalent of the local costs, mainly training expenses. The TA will be charged to the\nBank-funded TA program. The Government will finance the remaining $38,000 equivalent\nof the local currency costs, consisting of counterpart and secretarial staff, office supplies,\nfarm equipment operation and maintenance, provision of labor for demonstrations and\ntrials, domestic travel for counterpart staff, and domestic communications. The cost\nestimates are set out in detail in Appendix 1.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n13. The TA will be implemented over 18 months, commencing in April 1996\nand ending in November 1997. It will require the services of two individual consultants\nwith expertise in agricultural economics and marketing for 8 person-months, and\nagricultural extension for 10 person-months, for a total of 18 person-months. The\nagricultural economics and marketing specialist, who will be the team leader, will\ninvestigate production and market aspects and will initiate the establishment of a basic\nmarket information system and support federal and state project operational planning.\nThe agricultural extension specialist will review approaches to extension, and design and\ndeliver training that builds on successfully applied approaches within the FSM, as well\nBecause of the long duration of the TA, a vehicle will be purchased rather than hired.", "5\nas supervise field implementation. The training programs will encourage the involvement\nof FSM institutions in building a local training capacity for the ADs. The extension\nspecialist will also support extension program management and the improvement of\ncoordination between federal and state ADs, especially technical information flows. The\nconsultants will be engaged by the Bank on an individual basis and in accordance with\nthe Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The detailed terms of reference for the\nconsultants are in Appendix 2.\n14. The Executing Agency for the TA will be the DRD at the federal level and\nthe Secretary of DAD will be responsible for coordinating its implementation. The\nconsultants will work with the AD of DRD, which will ensure the provision of counterpart\nstaff at the federal and state levels and the arrangements for working closely with\nagriculture staff including extension agents. In addition, DRD will facilitate collaboration\nwith the DCI at the Federal level and its equivalent in all states for the marketing studies.\n15. The TA will provide equipment, planting materials, training materials, and\ntraining funds. Items will be procured by the Executing Agency in accordance with\narrangements acceptable to the Bank. Provision will also be made for engaging third\nparty trainers at the discretion of the Executing Agency and the consultants in\naccordance with the Bank's procedures. The DAD and state ADs will be responsible for\nproviding relevant data and information for the consultants and will make the necessary\narrangements to facilitate their work.\n16. The agricultural economist, as the team leader, will prepare a report on the\nresults of the marketing investigation and market information system at the end of the first\nfour month assignment, and will return later on for a second four month assignment to\nsupport further work on the market information system and project operational planning.\nThe agricultural extension specialist will spend the first two months reviewing existing\ninformation on agricultural production and assessing existing extension approaches, and\nabout two months in each of the four states establishing improved approaches and\nmanaging and conducting in-service training. The precise timing and duration of each\ninput will be reviewed as the TA progresses, and may be amended as necessary and as\nagreed by the Executing Agency, the consultants, and the Bank.\n17. The impact of the TA will be measured by assessing the degree of\nutilization of the agricultural commodity market information by producers and Government\nplanners, and the establishment and utilization by support services and staff of extension\napproaches that more effectively motivate communities and producers to produce for\nself-sufficiency, surpluses for the local market, import substitution, and export where\nviable.\nIV.
