I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Social Protection Development Project.1 \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of Pakistan\u2019s national social safety net program, \nthe Benazir Income Support Program (BISP). The project will enable the expansion of the cash \ntransfer program (paid to the female head of targeted poor families) by registering an additional \n2.4 million eligible families and contributing to financing their cash transfers. In addition, it will \nsupport  the  strengthening  and  phased  expansion  of  the  pilot  health  insurance  and  skills \ndevelopment programs to increase income and good health for targeted families. The project \nwill provide technical support and finance part of the scaling-up costs of both programs using a \nperformance-based allocation. The substantial fiduciary risk of the project will be mitigated \nthrough the strengthening of BISP financial management systems and capacity.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  latest  official  estimates  of  poverty  incidence  were  released  in  Pakistan  in \n2005/2006, with the headcount index for poverty reported at 22.3%.3 Since 2007, Pakistan\u2019s \neconomy has faced difficult challenges, including external and domestic economic shocks, \neconomic uncertainty, and security problems. Annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nrates post-2007 averaged about 3%, while inflation averaged 13.8%, resulting in lower living \nstandards. A recent study, using district-based poverty profiles, estimated poverty incidence for \nall households in the country may have risen up to 33%.4 \n \n4.  Starting  in  2007,  the  government  significantly  increased  its  spending  on  social \nprotection,  established  a  new  institutional  framework,  and  approved  the  National  Social \nProtection Strategy.5 In October 2008, the government launched the BISP as the national social \nsafety net program. The immediate objective was to decrease the adverse impact of food, fuel, \nand  financial  crises  on  low-income  families.  The  broader  goal  was  to  implement  the \ngovernment\u2019s redistributive policy by providing regular cash income support to the poor. The \nmain BISP intervention is a cash transfer program providing PRs1,000 per month to the female \nhead of the family.6 The government\u2019s social safety net spending increased from 0.3% of GDP \nin FY2004 to 0.9% in FY2011 after introducing the BISP.7  \n \n5.  The  BISP  uses  a  transparent  and  objective  methodology  to  select  beneficiaries.  It \nidentified  7.2 million  eligible  poor families  (23%  of the total  population)  on the  basis  of a \nnationwide  poverty  scorecard  survey  using  a  proxy-means test  approach.  Initial  evaluation \nfindings demonstrate that it is a credible targeting system, covering a substantial number of the \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

The \nwoman in the family holds a computerized national identity card (CNIC) or has applied for one. \n7  World Bank. 2012. Pakistan. Towards an Integrated National Safety Net System. Washington, DC. \n ", "2  \npoorest in Pakistan. 8 However, 2.4 million eligible poor families are not yet receiving the cash \ntransfer because the female head does not hold a CNIC, which is the key eligibility criterion \n(footnote 6). Pending families are the most difficult to reach and likely to be the most destitute.9  \n \n6.  The introduction of a national safety net program and the availability of the poverty \nscorecard database can potentially lead to more efficient use of resources and better targeting \nand  coordination  with  the  provincial  social  safety  net  programs.  A  well-managed  targeting \nsystem will enable the replacement, over time, of other inefficient social safety net programs \nand untargeted subsidies that are still pervasive in Pakistan. 10 \n \n7.  The BISP piloted several initiatives to help the poor graduate from poverty, including \nhealth insurance, skills development training, small business development loans, and primary \neducation  co-responsibility  cash  transfers. 11  These  programs  aim  to  support  human \ndevelopment  and  economic  opportunities  for  beneficiaries,  and  reduce  the  likelihood  of \nintergenerational transfer of poverty. The first two of these graduation initiatives are of special \nrelevance for social protection: \n(i)  Almost  70%  of  total  health  expenditures  are  paid  out-of-pocket  by  families, \ndriving about 4% of the population into poverty every year.12 Unexpected severe \nhealth problems are the most prevalent shock for families. In addition to income \nloss from being unable to work, medical costs alone can push households into \npoverty. Health insurance for the poor that covers catastrophic risks and major \ncosts such as births can provide significant financial relief and protection to the \nmost vulnerable families, while improving access to health facilities.  \n(ii)  More than 53% of the target population depends on casual labor as their major \nsource of income\u2014it is insecure and risky.13 Beneficiary family members have \nextremely  low  literacy  and  numeracy,  affecting  confidence  and  social \nparticipation. Rural employment opportunities (both wage employment and self-\nemployment) could be enhanced through skills training. This will improve poor \nfamilies\u2019 income-generating capacity and boost their resilience to shocks.  \n \n8.  In April 2012, the BISP launched a health insurance program, Waseela-e-Sehet (WES), \non a pilot basis to provide protection against catastrophic health expenditure to registered \nbeneficiary families in Faisalabad district in Punjab Province through the State Life Insurance \nCorporation. The insurance package covers full hospitalization for all age groups with an annual \nmaximum benefit cap of PRs25,000 per family. It covers preexisting conditions as well as \nhospitalization for maternity and child health. So far, 37,575 families have been insured and \nprovided access to WES registered private hospitals on a cashless and paperless basis. Of \nthese expenditures, 40% were maternity related. \n                                                \n8  BISP. 2011. Baseline Survey Report of the Benazir Income Support Program. Islamabad. Of the total number of \neligible households, 73% are below the national poverty line; 27% are between 100% and 125% of the poverty line. \n9  Other major achievements of the BISP are (i) creation of the National Socio-Economic Registry to manage data \nsharing of the poverty scorecard survey results using a data-sharing protocol; (ii) application of technology-based \nsolutions for verification and payment to ensure efficiency and transparency; and (iii) establishment of a nationwide \ntechnology-based network of grievance redressal offices. Every process is independently monitored and results \nare evaluated annually. \n10  For example, power subsidies were PRs464 billion (2.25% of GDP) in FY2012. The largest share of the subsidy \nwent to the richest sections of society, and only PRs4 billion went to lifeline consumers. \n11  These \u201cgraduation\u201d programs are not to be understood as following the \u201cgraduation model\u201d being piloted in different \ndeveloping economies to target the extreme poor, which follows a specific sequence of (i) nutrition support,  \n(ii) productive asset transfer (on a grant basis), (iii) skills training and self-confidence building, (iv) financial literacy \ntraining, and (v) credit support (if needed by the targeted family, and if the family has \u201cgraduated\u201d). \n12  World Bank. 2010.

The Waseela-e-Rozgar  (WER)  was  launched  in  July  2011  to  provide  center-based \nformal skills training to any selected family member of a beneficiary. In FY2013, 56,600 trainees \ngraduated from both public and private training centers providing 4\u20136 month programs out of a \nlist  of  52  pre-selected  professions,  including  welder,  auto  mechanic  and  receptionist.  The \ncurrent WER is very costly. The average cost of PRs53,000 limits outreach of the program. \nMost courses are taught beyond the absorptive capacity of BISP potential nominees, who are \nlargely illiterate or semiliterate. Training delivery and competency assessment and certification \nhave fundamental problems. While the impact of current training provision on employability is \nlimited, the reputational risks of current training delivery arrangements and weak monitoring are \nhigh. \n \n10.  Under the 18th Constitutional Amendment (30 June 2011), several subjects\u2014including \nhealth,  education,  and  social  welfare\u2014became  a  shared  responsibility  of  the  federal \ngovernment and the provinces. The federal government continues to play a critical role in \nensuring  that  long-term  poverty  reduction  and  social  protection goals  are met.  A  centrally \noperated safety net program is better placed to ensure equal chances for the poor to qualify for \nthe  cash  transfer  program,  and  to  coordinate  consistent  program  standards  for  provincial \ngraduation programs. The provinces play a key role to develop and implement complementary \ngraduation programs, especially highly customized graduation interventions (footnote 11). \n \n11.  Several development partners are supporting the BISP in the design and implementation \nof its programs. The World Bank provided a $60 million technical assistance (TA) credit for the \ndevelopment of a transparent targeting and delivery mechanism. The United States Agency for \nInternational Development provided $160 million of budget support for the payment of cash \ngrants  to  beneficiaries  identified  using  the  poverty  scorecard  survey.  The  World  Bank  is \nproviding $150 million and the Department for International Development (DFID) of the United \nKingdom \u00a3300 million to support expansion of the cash transfer program coverage to up to  \n5.5 million beneficiary families by sharing a small part of the total cost of the cash transfer, and \nthe introduction of a co-responsibility cash transfer program on education. GIZ is providing TA \nfor the health insurance pilot program. \n \n12.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been a BISP partner since its inception. Under \nthe Accelerating Economic Transformation Program (AETP) Subprogram 1, ADB supported the \nlaunching of the BISP to mitigate the social impact of the food and fuel crises of 2007 and \n2008.14 Under the AETP Subprogram 2, ADB allocated $150 million equivalent in counterpart \nfunds for the BISP to provide cash transfers to beneficiaries identified by the poverty scorecard \nsurvey.15 The Office of the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) audited the FY2012 financial \nstatements for this subprogram and issued a modified audit opinion.16 The BISP contested the \naudit opinion and clarified the payment process through partner banks.17 In response, AGP \nindicated that the audit opinion could be revisited in light of any additional information provided \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n15  ADB. 2009. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loans for \nSubprogram 2 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Accelerating Economic Transformation Program. Manila. \n16  The  AGP  audit  opinion  states  that  approximately  16.78%  of  the  counterpart  funds  were  paid  to  ineligible \nbeneficiaries who did not possess a CNIC or a valid CNIC. \n17  Transfers to partner banks for eligible beneficiaries include a buffer sum for those who are awaiting CNIC \nregistration. An initial review of the audit report commissioned by ADB confirmed that payments under ADB funding \nwere made to eligible beneficiaries in line with the eligibility definition in the BISP Operations Manual. As an \nadditional mitigating measure  for  the  project,  ADB commissioned  an additional  review  of  the  payments  to \nbeneficiaries to provide further confirmation that ADB funds were released to eligible, registered, and verified \nbeneficiaries. This review is currently ongoing. \n ", "4  \nby the BISP. The BISP provided further documentation supporting the payments in question. \nADB is working closely with the Ministry of Finance and the BISP to seek AGP review of the \nadditional supporting documentation. Resolution of this issue within a specified timeframe is a \ncovenant for the proposed loan for the project requiring either the revision of the audit opinion or \nthe repayment of the transfers made to the ineligible beneficiaries by the government to ADB, if \nany. In addition, DFID and the World Bank are providing substantial strengthening of financial \nmanagement systems under their ongoing and concurrent projects, and further support will be \nprovided by the project (see paras. 33 and 40). Strengthening of the social safety net system is \nincluded in the ADB country partnership strategy, as support for the transition from inefficient \nsubsidy schemes to targeted cash transfer programs.18 The project is included in the country \noperations business plan.19 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.   The impact of the project will be reduced income and nonincome poverty. The outcome \nwill be increased resilience for BISP female beneficiaries and their families.  \n \nC.  Outputs \n14.  The project will support the full expansion of the BISP\u2019s cash transfer program to eligible \nfamilies, and the improvement and expansion of two graduation programs: the health insurance \nprogram and the skills development program. Expansion of the three programs will be rigorously \nmonitored and evaluated at regular intervals to encourage improvements based on lessons \nidentified. BISP financial management and control systems will be strengthened. \n \n15.  Output 1: Cash transfer program coverage expanded. The output will support the \nenrollment of all traceable, female headed, eligible beneficiary families. The provision of the \ncash  transfer  through  the  female  head  and  linking  the  benefit  to  possession  of  and \nunderstanding the CNIC empowers the role of women in the family. Currently, approximately \none-third  of  eligible  beneficiaries  do  not  receive  the  cash  transfer  because  registration  is \npending. The case management system and appeals process have been adding an average of \n100,000 eligible beneficiaries per month to the program since September 2012. This rate of new \nenrollments will slow as case management teams work with eligible beneficiaries who are more \ndifficult to locate and enroll. Eligible beneficiaries will be reevaluated and rescored as part of a \nrecertification process by May 2016.  \n \n16.  The  project  will  finance  the  first  5  quarters  (at  PRs3,000  per  quarter)  of  the  cash \ntransfers to all newly enrolled beneficiaries.20 The project will mobilize survey teams to sensitize \nand complete the information on pending beneficiaries. The National Database Registration \nAuthority will field mobile and semimobile teams to issue the CNICs. The BISP subdistrict \n(tehsil) offices will ensure clear beneficiary understanding of their CNIC and BISP rights and \nresponsibilities. The project will closely monitor the timely delivery of the cash transfers to the \nnew  beneficiaries,  using regular  spot  checks. The  payment  release for  cash transfers  will \ndepend on the results of the spot checks and other financial and performance monitoring. \n \n17.  Output 2: Health insurance program refined and rolled out. This output will support \nthe strengthening and expansion of the WES health insurance program in a phased manner. \nBISP beneficiaries in pilot districts will receive health insurance protection against catastrophic \n                                                \n18  ADB. 2009.

", "5 \n \nhealth costs, and support to access hospitals in case of reproductive or other serious health \nproblems.  \n \n18.  The WES has developed a detailed implementation plan and strategic framework for \nexpanding the health insurance program to achieve national coverage as soon as practical. \nApproval of this plan is a prerequisite for ADB support and will be presented first to the BISP \nboard. The medium-term expansion is divided into two phases. In the first phase, the WES will \nbe expanded to 5 more districts, and information will be gathered on the actual cost of the \ninsurance  package  as  utilization  increases.  A  more  detailed,  preparatory  design  will  be \ncompleted by mid-2014 and the expansion will be launched to 10 more districts by late 2016. A \npotential third phase may be prepared at the end of the project, based on the findings of the \nmonitoring and evaluation reports and other related studies. \n \n19.  The project will provide technical support under an ADB, GIZ and WES common detailed \nimplementation  plan.  The  project  will  finance  the  development  and  implementation  of  a \nmonitoring and evaluation system for stakeholders through a web-based information technology \nplatform. The platform will interface with the National Database Registration Authority\u2019s CNIC \ndatabase and allow insurers to track claims, investigate suspicious claims, and transfer funds to \nproviders. The project will support capacity building for the WES and its partners, and help raise \nawareness in the expansion districts through communication campaigns and a call center to \nmanage complaints and contact beneficiaries after discharge. The project will provide cash \npayment to beneficiaries for transport upon discharge from hospital. The project will support an \nimpact evaluation near the end of each phase. Based on the findings of the midterm review, the \nproject may provide cofinancing for the actual premium (para. 24). \n \n20.  Output 3: Skills development program strengthened. This output will help implement \nimportant  modifications  to  the  WER  skills  development  program  to  increase  beneficiaries\u2019 \nemployability  and  make  the  program  more  cost-effective,  financially  transparent,  and \naccountable. The target beneficiaries will be offered improved, targeted skills training in forms \nthat  match  their  personal  circumstances,  and  provide  better  matches  to  wage  and  self-\nemployment  opportunities  that  exist  within  their  districts.  The  training  will  be  provided  to \nbeneficiaries  or  their  family  members  in  communities,  companies,  and  training  centers, \ndepending on the needs and abilities of trainees and skill demands in their locations.  \n \n21.  During phase 1, the project will finance a survey of employment opportunities and skills \nneeds in the 13 districts identified by the BISP for pilot programs during 2014\u20132016. The project \nwill develop and implement a complete monitoring and evaluation framework (including external \nmonitoring arrangements), with a dedicated management information system for the WER to \nenhance BISP oversight and control capabilities. The project will strengthen the existing center-\nbased modality on a priority basis by addressing current contractual and delivery flaws. The \nproject  will  also  support  training  course  standardization  for  high-demand  skills,  and  the \nengagement  of  a  social  mobilization  organization  to  match  BISP  nominees  with  training \nopportunities.  In  parallel  two  additional  modalities,  community-based  and  enterprise-based \ntraining, will be added to the WER. They will provide shorter and less expensive courses that \nare more relevant to beneficiaries\u2019 circumstances, especially female beneficiaries in rural areas.  \n \n22.  Implementation of the two new modalities will start during phase 2 in 2015. The new \ntraining methods will be rolled out based on a strategic road map, which will be presented first to \nthe BISP board. The gradual redistribution of resources will allow the training of many more \nbeneficiaries  within  the  existing  WER  budget.  In  phase  3,  the  program  can  be  gradually \nexpanded to cover more districts. Depending on the findings of the first impact evaluation and a \nmidterm review, the project could provide additional cofinancing support (para. 24).  \n ", "6  \n23.  Output  4:  Financial  management  and  control  systems,  and  policy  research \nimproved.  This  output  will  help  develop  transparent  financial  management  and  adequate \nmonitoring systems in the BISP. It will strengthen the financial management wing, and introduce \nmodern tools and practices in the area of budget preparation, cash forecasting, and financial \nreporting. It will support the internal audit wing by providing resources and training on modern \ninternal audit tools and practices. It will strengthen the social policy research unit, providing \nsupport for engendered (gender focused), evidence-based policy and planning. \n \n24.  Performance  allocation  for  graduation  programs.  This  allocation  will  enable  the \nproject to finance the scaling-up challenges that the programs supported by outputs 2 (health \ninsurance) and 3 (skills development) will eventually face. Resources will remain unallocated \nuntil a thorough midterm review is conducted. The performance allocation enables the project to \n(i) provide additional support for related procurement or fiduciary risks in the two pilots before \ncommitting to fund part of the main costs involved in scaling-up WER and WES activities (actual \npremium or training delivery fees); (ii) encourage good implementation performance in both \ncomponents toward agreed targets; and (iii) base conditions for project financing of actual \ninsurance and training service delivery on efficient, effective, and transparent implementation of \nboth programs during the first part of the project. \n \n25.  Midterm project review. The midterm review, scheduled for the third quarter of 2016 \nwill  assess  the  progress  of  project  activities,  outputs,  and  outcomes.  The  performance  of  \noutputs 2 (health insurance) and 3 (skills development) will be reviewed in detail to determine \nachievement of quantitative targets indicated in the design and monitoring framework, and \nqualitative  goals  described  in  detail  in  the  project  administration  manual.21 Based  on  the \nfindings, the midterm review will recommend use of the performance allocation fund designated \nfor  the  two  graduation  programs  during  the  second  part  of  the  project.  The  $40  million \nperformance  allocation  fund  will  only  be  used  after  the  midterm  review  is  successfully \ncompleted; and the government, BISP, and ADB have agreed on the use of the loan for this \ncomponent and its implementation arrangements. \n \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n29.  The BISP will be the executing agency for the project. A project management unit will be \nshared with the World Bank. The ADB section will comprise a project manager, a financial \nmanagement specialist, an internal auditor, and a procurement specialist who will be hired \nthroughout the project period to support project implementation. \n \n30.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Economic and Financial \n31.  All three programs supported under this project are expected to have positive impacts on \nthe beneficiaries\u2019 family income and capacity to withstand shocks. The cash transfer program \nand the health insurance program smooth family consumption and mitigate the impact of health-\nrelated shocks. Cash transfers will improve the nutritional status of the family, particularly of \nchildren. Better nutrition for children is an important determinant of cognitive development, \nschool attainment, and return to schooling. In the long term, skills training can significantly \nincrease beneficiaries\u2019 earning potential, especially in Pakistan where the unskilled\u2013skilled labor \nwage  gap  is  significant.  In  the  longer  term,  investments  in  social  protection  can  yield \ngovernment savings, as the poorest households become more resilient to shocks and build their \nhuman capital; they are able to improve their employment potential, thus graduating from BISP \nprograms.  \nB.  Governance \n32.  The ADB financial management assessment rates the premitigation risk substantial and \nidentifies several weaknesses in the BISP financial management system. The following were \nfound to be of direct relevance for the project: (i) weak processes for reconciliation with Pakistan \nPost and no regular reconciliation of beneficiary payments made through the banking system; \n(ii) absence of audited financial statements; (iii) weak institutional capacity; and (iv) delays in \nreleases from the federal government. The BISP is required, through the BISP Act 2010, to \nhave its financial statements audited on an annual basis by AGP. To date, the BISP has not \nprepared annual financial statements. At the request of ADB, DFID, and World Bank, the BISP \nis preparing its financial statements for FY2012 and FY2013. The FY2013 financial statements \nwill be audited by AGP and provided to ADB prior to the loan being declared effective. For \nconcerns about financial management and reporting, the corruption risk is rated substantial. \n \n33.  ADB, DFID, and World Bank are working closely with the BISP on an ongoing basis to \nidentify and mitigate fiduciary risks. The BISP now processes quarterly cash payments using a \nmanagement  information  system-based  payment  mechanism  that  avoids  duplication  of \npayments. TA provided by the World Bank (which is significantly involved in day-to-day financial \nmanagement operations) helps mitigate the fiduciary risks. Ongoing ADB TA helped to resolve \nbank and Pakistan Post reconciliations and other issues. Initially all payments were transferred \nthrough Pakistan Post. Since 2012, the BISP has been issuing debit cards, and by the start of \nthe project most payments will be made through private banks. This allows for management \ninformation system-based account reconciliation on a monthly basis. The project will reimburse \nthe BISP for payments through Pakistan Post and through banks for the first quarterly payment \nto new beneficiaries after reconciliation. To reduce corruption risk, the BISP maintains a website \nwhere individual beneficiaries can log in and check their entitlements and payment status. The \nBISP is partnering with Transparency International to monitor BISP procurement processes.  \n \n34.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  BISP.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual (footnote 21). \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n35.  Poverty and social impacts. The cash transfer program is highly successful in reaching \nthe poorest families (footnote 8). The quarterly payments provide a regular income to poor ", "9 \n \nfamilies and help smooth consumption. The transfer amounts to around 7% of monthly family \nexpenditure, and would require an increase to substantially change consumption patterns. While \nthe cash transfer bridges some of the gap between actual income and the amount needed to \nmove out of poverty, the payment does not create any undesirable dependency. \n \n36.  Gender impacts. The project contributes to gender empowerment as the major thematic \npurpose of the intervention. The project design is based on gender analysis from many sources \nincluding an extensive BISP baseline evaluation study and focus group discussions. Women in \neach eligible household are the recipients of the cash transfers. The necessary preconditions of \nthe CNIC and the provision of a dedicated bank account add to the empowerment potential. \nWomen are the primary health insurance cardholders, with family member eligibility linked to \nthem.  Community-based  training  is  more  likely  to  draw  women  participants.  All  of  these \narrangements have been shown to increase the \u201cfelt worth\u201d of women in poor households, and \nhave the potential to improve women\u2019s role in intrahousehold management of resources, ability \nto make decisions, and contribution to the household economy. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n37.  The project is classified as category C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples in accordance with the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The BISP \nis an inclusive program that does not discriminate based on indigenous status. The program \nbeneficiaries are selected based on the results of a poverty scorecard survey using proxy \nmeans  testing.  No  questions  are  included  on  religion,  language,  or  ethnicity,  to  ensure \nparticipation and inclusion of all poor irrespective of tribe, subtribe, or minority status. Since the \nproject will not support any physical intervention, no land acquisition will be required. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  While  systems  are  in  place  to  ensure  transparency  and  funds  delivery  to  the \nbeneficiaries in a timely manner, institutional capacity will need to be strengthened to make \npayments a low-risk intervention.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized  as \nfollows, and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.22  \n \n39.  The overall risk rating is substantial. The key risks are specific weaknesses in BISP \nfinancial management: (i) lack of regular reconciliation of the cash transfer program, (ii) absence \nof annual financial statements for the program, (iii) absence of annual audit of the program \nfinancial  statements,  (iv)  outstanding  issues  arising  from  the  audit  of  the  project  financial \nstatements of the AETP Subprogram 2, (v) weak institutional capacity (including weaknesses in \nfinancial reporting and internal audit), and (vi) delays in releases from the federal government.  \n \n40.  In consultation with DFID and World Bank, risk mitigation actions were identified to \naddress financial management weaknesses: (i) ADB, DFID and World Bank assisted in the \nreconciliation of all funds transferred through FY2013 by Pakistan Post and partner banks; the \nBISP adopted a timely and acceptable reconciliation process for future transfers; (ii) the BISP \nwill prepare annual financial statements for audit starting with FY2012 and FY2013; (iii) the \nBISP will have audited financial statements prepared from FY2013 onward; (iv) the resolution of \nthe issue with the AETP Subprogram 2 audit opinion within a specified timeframe is a covenant \nfor the loan; (v) ADB, DFID, and World Bank are providing support for financial management \n                                                \n22 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10  \nand internal audit, and helping to ensure a sufficient number of qualified staff for long-term risk \nmitigation; and (vi) the timely release of government funds is listed as a covenant.  \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n41.  The government and the BISP have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n42.  The government and the BISP have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nproject, which are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. The government and \nthe BISP also agreed to the following conditions for effectiveness:  \n(i)  The BISP board will establish an audit committee of the board to oversee the \nfinancial reporting and audit of the BISP, which includes the review of internal \naudit reports. Such a committee will include a nongovernment member of the \nboard, preferably with audit oversight experience.  \n(ii)  The  BISP  will  provide  to  ADB  (a)  BISP\u2019s  unaudited financial  statements for \nFY2012 and FY2013 by 30 September 2013 and (b) BISP\u2019s audited financial \nstatements for FY2013 (with the associated audit report and management letter) \ntogether with an action plan, satisfactory to ADB, to address any deficiencies \nidentified in the audit. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n43.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various \ncurrencies equivalent to SDR283,776,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Social \nProtection Development Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge \nat the rate of 2% per annum during the grace period and thereafter; for a term of 25 years, \nincluding a grace period of 5 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan and project agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \n     President \n27 September 2013 ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nImpact  By 2023    Assumption \nReduced income  Extreme income poverty  Pakistan social and  Economic growth is \npoverty and  reduced   living standards  sustained. \nnonincome poverty  Baseline: 33% in 2012,  measurement survey \nfor poor families in  target: 30% \nPakistan  Maternal mortality ratio  Pakistan social and  Risk \nreduced (number of  living standards  Fiscal policy constrains \nmothers dying per 100,000  measurement survey   government \nlive births)   Multiple indicator cluster  expenditure \nBaseline: 300 in 2011,  survey \ntarget: 120 \nOutcome       \nIncreased resilience  Average per capita  Household integrated  Assumption \nof female BISP  consumption expenditure of  economic survey  Labor market (wage \nbeneficiaries and  beneficiaries increased  BISP impact evaluation   and self-employment) is \ntheir families  Baseline: PRs1,575 = 100  able to absorb skilled \nin 2012, target: 105 in 2018  labor trained under the \nproject. \n  Beneficiaries with health  Internal monitoring    \ninsurance using health  Impact evaluation of  Risk  \nservices for catastrophic  health insurance  Specific weaknesses in \nhealth event increased  program  financial management \nBaseline: 0.39% in 2012,  lead to \nmidterm: 0.97%,   underachievement of \ntarget: 1.37% in 2018  targets, high transaction \ncost, and unsatisfied \nbeneficiaries. \n  Skilled employment rate of  Survey on economic   \ntrained beneficiaries in pilot  opportunities and skills \ndistricts within 3 months of  needs \ntraining increased   Impact evaluation of \nBaseline: 34% in 2012,  skills development \nmidterm: 37%, target: 42%  program \nin 2018, of which at least \n35% are women \nOutputs      Risk \n1.
