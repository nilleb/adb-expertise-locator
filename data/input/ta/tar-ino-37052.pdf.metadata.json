To support its efforts in poverty reduction and coastal fisheries resource management, \nthe Government of Indonesia (the Government) has requested the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for technical  assistance  (TA)  to  prepare  the  Integrated  Coastal  Fisheries  Resource \nManagement (ICFRM) Project. The TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Indonesia in April 2004 and \ndiscussed  the  project  concept  with  representatives  of  Government  agencies,  regional \ngovernments, nongovernment organizations (NGOs) and coastal communities. The Mission \nreached understandings with the Government on the objectives, scope and components, cost \nestimates  and  financing  plan,  implementation  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants for the TA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s 2004 country assistance program for \nIndonesia.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Indonesia is the world\u2019s largest archipelagic nation. Its 81,000-kilomenter (km) coastline, \nthe second longest in the world, is a critical lifeline that anchors the country\u2019s social, economic, \nand environmental development. The coastal zone is a highly productive ecosystem that serves \nas an important base for the country\u2019s growth. Whether measured in economic or environmental \nterms, or by the more fundamental standard of output of consumable food protein, Indonesia\u2019s \ncoastal area contributes significantly to its overall productivity. The coastal zone provides food \nand livelihood to the country\u2019s coastal communities and hosts numerous economic activities,  \nincluding  capture  fisheries  and  aquaculture,  which  supply  the  bulk  of  the  country\u2019s  fish \nrequirements. The coastal waters contribute over 55% of the national fish harvest and food \nfish provide about 67% of the animal protein consumed by the population. The fisheries sector \ncontributed 2.3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2002. In addition, some of the richest \nareas of biodiversity occur in the coastal zone of the country and include coral reefs, mangrove \nswamps, seagrass beds, lagoons, and estuaries. \n \n3.  However, the Indonesian marine and fisheries sector is beset with a number of problems \nthat need to be addressed to ensure its sustainable development and management. Foremost \namong  these  are  the  two  critical  and  interrelated  issues  of  pervasive  poverty  in  coastal \ncommunities  and  resource  degradation  due  to  habitat  degradation,  overfishing,  pollution, \nerosion,  and  siltation.  The  sector  continues  to  suffer  from  policy,  legal,  and  institutional \nconstraints affecting marine and fisheries resource management.  \n \n4.  To address the problems of resources management and poverty in the coastal areas, in \n1999 the Government created the Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF), to be the \nlead agency in coastal resource management. MMAF prepared the Strategic Plan (2005-2009) \nfor  sustainable  management  and  use  of  coastal  and  marine  ecosystems  and  fisheries \nresources. The plan emphasizes the following strategies: (i) development and management of \nthe coastal and fisheries sector to contribute to national economy and food security, (ii) coastal \ncommunity empowerment and participation in the ICFRM process, (iii) provision of alternative \nlivelihood  and  basic  services  to  increase  income  and  improve  living  conditions  of  coastal \ncommunities, (iv) pollution and erosion control, and (v) development of an ICFRM program and \ncapacity building on sustainable management of marine and fisheries resource. The legal basis \nfor coastal fisheries resource management is articulated in several laws, the most important of \nwhich are the Law No.9/1985 on Fisheries, Law No. 5/1990, Conservation of Living Natural \nResources and the Environment, Law No. 22/1999 on Regional Governance and Law No. \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 11 May 2004. \n ", " 2  \n25/1999 on Financial Balance between Central and Regional Governments, as well as relevant \nministerial decrees of MMAF. However, no single law or regulation officially recognizes the \nICFRM Project as a management approach.  \n \n5.  Since the 1990s, various measures and programs were adopted in 80 coastal districts all \nover  the  country  to  promote  the  ICFRM  Project.  However,  these  measures  emphasized \nresearch, resource evaluation and planning, and pilot field implementation rather than resource \nmanagement. Their impacts on coastal resources management have been limited due to lack of \nan integrated approach and broad-based participation by stakeholders.  \n \n6.  ADB has actively supported the Government\u2019s efforts in marine and coastal resource \nmanagement and fisheries development through loans and TAs. In the last 10 years, MMAF has \nimplemented five ADB marine and coastal fisheries resource management projects.2   \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s  projects  have  played  critical  role  in  promoting  Indonesia\u2019s  coastal  resource \nmanagement and demonstrating an integrated approach for coastal community development \nand fisheries resource management. The projects have produced a number of impacts and \nbenefits, including (i) strengthened capacity and increased awareness of poverty in the coastal \nareas and of the imperatives of sustainable fisheries resource management, among national \nand  regional  government  officials,  the  private  sector,  and  NGOs  and  local  communities \nnationwide; (ii) an improved coastal resource base in the project areas, such as coral reefs, \nmangroves, and coastal fish stocks; and (iii) increased income and improved living conditions of \npoor coastal communities in the project areas. \n \n8.  The lessons learned highlight the (i) importance of the long-term process of coastal \nresource management and poverty reduction; and (ii) need for (a) strong leadership and a \ncapable implementation agency; (b) comprehensive analysis and assessment of operational \nrequirements, barriers, and risks;  (c) an integrated approach, and well-designed program to \naddress  simultaneously  environmental  and  social  issues  in  coastal  areas; \n(d)  active  participation  of  the  private  sector  and  communities  in  project  preparation  and \nimplementation;  and  (e)  provision  of  social  and  technical  services  and  tangible  economic \nactivities for poor coastal communities. \n \n9.  To implement an effective national ICFRM program, additional efforts and elements \nmust be set in place. Action plans need to be developed to link market-based instruments to \nreflect proper fisheries resource pricing. National policy should emphasize the critical roles of \nthe regional governments in the ICFRM Project and provide adequate technical and financial \nsupport.  The  existing  administrative  structure  needs  strengthening  to  implement  national \npolicies on the ICFRM Project. A robust ICFRM program should be based on a truly integrated \napproach that simultaneously addresses management of coastal ecosystems, pollution, and \npoverty. To be holistic, an ICFRM program should also deal with the provision of basic social \n                                                \n2  ADB. 1992.

The magnitude of Indonesia\u2019s problems in the coastal and fisheries sector requires that \ncurrent programs of assistance be continued and expanded to cover a wider geographic area \nfollowing an ecosystem approach to benefit a larger population. The proposed ICFRM Project is \nenvisaged to cover nine districts of eight provinces.3 The poverty incidence in the nine districts \nis estimated at 30%, compared to national poverty incidence of 18%. The districts to be covered \nby the feasibility study will be selected using the following criteria: (i) high incidence poverty;  \n(ii)  necessity  for  continuation  of  Loan  No.  1570/1571(SF)-INO:  Coastal  Community \nDevelopment and Fisheries Resource Management in the old sites and expansion into new \nareas;  (iii)  importance  of  coastal  resources  and  globally  significant  biodiversity;  and  (iv) \ninitiatives and commitment of the regional government, private sector, and communities to \nimplement the ICFRM Project. The ICFRM Project will build on the previous coastal fisheries \nresource management initiatives through replication of successful approaches, implementation \nof policies, and effective use of management interventions. The proposed ICFRM Project is in \nline with the Government\u2019s long- and medium-term development objectives as well as ADB\u2019s \noverarching goal of poverty reduction and its medium-term operational strategy, which focuses \non poverty reduction, natural resource conservation, and environmental protection.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The goal of the ICFRM Project is to support the Government initiatives for poverty \nreduction and sustainable natural resource management in coastal areas.  The TA will assist in \npreparing the ICFRM Project, which will improve the condition of coastal and marine fisheries \nand  related  resources  and  reduce  poverty  in  coastal  communities  by  improving  the \nmanagement  of  coastal  resources  and  ecosystems,  minimizing  threats  to  their  ecological \nintegrity, and providing income generation and alternative livelihood opportunities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will adopt a participatory and consultative approach as a basic strategy to \ninvolve potential beneficiaries and stakeholders in (i) policy and institutional review and sector \nupdate; and (ii) detailed technical, economic, financial, social, and environmental studies. The \nTA will examine all risks faced by potential beneficiaries, and ensure compliance with social and \nenvironmental assessment and safeguards. Relevant information, data, technical approaches, \npolicy recommendations, and lessons learned from previous ADB-funded projects and other \nrelevant projects will be key inputs in the TA study. The TA will conduct participatory rapid \nappraisals, poverty analysis, and socioeconomic assessment in nine districts of eight provinces \nand organize and conduct stakeholder workshops to discuss on the ICFRM project design and \nimplementation arrangements. \n \n13.  The TA will review and update the status of marine and coastal fisheries resources in the \ncountry,  determine  major  problems,  and  identify  opportunities  and  strategies  to  achieve \n                                                \n3  The  ICFRM  Project  will  be  implemented  in  nine  districts  including  five  districts  covered  under  Loan  Nos. \n1570/1571(SF)-INO: Coastal Community Development and Fisheries Resource Management Project (footnote 2) \n(viz., Tegal, Central Java; Prigi and Muncar, East Java; Bengkalis, Riau; and East Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara) \nand four expansion sites, namely: Pandeglang, Banten; Belu, East Nusa Tenggara; Pantura, Gorontalo; and \nTernate, North Maluku. \n ", " 4  \nsustainable management of fisheries resource. The TA will use surveys, questionnaires, and \nfocus group discussions to collect baseline data, and protocols for monitoring and evaluation. \nThe  TA  will  engage  in  coalition-building  activities,  such  as  workshops  and  seminars,  to \nengender  project  ownership  and  facilitate  prioritization  of  proposed  interventions  by \nstakeholders.  \n \n14.  The  TA  will  formulate  an  investment  project  with  four  components:  (i)  policy  and \ninstitutional strengthening for national and regional coastal resource management; (ii) coastal \nfisheries resource management, including rehabilitation and protection of fisheries resources \nand related ecosystems through regional governments; (iii) provision of sustainable livelihoods \nassistance4 for income generation for coastal communities and fishers; and (iv) small-scale \ninfrastructure development, including fish landing facilities to reduce production losses and \nprovide environmental and social investments in pollution control, environmental protection, \nprovision of social services, marketing facilities and infrastructure, and population management. \nThe project framework will be developed as part of the process to facilitate project design. \n \n15.  The  institutional  assessment  will  include  an  analysis  of  roles,  responsibilities,  and \ncapabilities of national and regional agencies, coastal communities, and private sector/NGOs in \nthe ICFRM Project. Policy analysis under the TA will include the potential use of market-based \ninstruments for paying for resources, and further development of property rights and licensing \nsystems. Particular emphasis will be placed in delineating the private sector\u2019s role in project \ndesign and implementation through appropriate public-private partnership programs. \n \n16.  The TA will assess proposed ICFRM project activities and formulate technical guidelines \nand methods for implementing the activities, taking into consideration technical, environmental, \nand ecological conditions; local initiatives; and the availability of major inputs and support \nfacilities.  The  TA  will  identify  economically  viable  and  environmentally  sound  alternative \nlivelihood developments for demonstration and replication by community-based organizations \nand the private sector. The output will be a range of options from which people can select and \ndesign the system that most effectively meets their needs and best fits the opportunities and \nconstraints of the local environment. The TA will conduct environmental impact assessments for \nthe proposed development activities, identify any positive and negative environmental impacts \nof the investment project, and recommend measures to mitigate possible negative impacts.  \n \n17.  The TA will (i) analyze relevant economic information, estimate costs and benefits for the \nproposed ICFRM Project and components, (ii) estimate economic rates of return and financial \nbenefits, (iii) conduct economic valuation of environmental impacts and analyze the financial \nviability of the proposed ICFRM project activities, (iv) analyze project risks, (v) review the \nmanagement mechanisms for public funds and recommend suitable financial arrangements in \naccordance with the policy on regional development and decentralization for the subsequent \nICFRM Project, (vi) assess the financial capacity of participating regional governments, and (vii) \nconduct marketing study for the livelihood products.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.09 million equivalent, comprising $560,000 in \nforeign exchange cost and $530,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The Government of \nUnited Kingdom will finance $790,000 equivalent on a grant basis, covering the entire foreign \n                                                \n4  The ICFRM Project will not have a specific credit component, but will facilitate access of beneficiaries to existing \ncredit schemes. ", "    5\nexchange  cost  of  $560,000  and  $230,000  equivalent  of  the  local  currency  cost.  The \nGovernment will contribute the balance of the local currency cost of $300,000 equivalent to \ncover local travel, survey, and expenses for the office and counterpart staff. The Government \nhas been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nThe detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Directorate General of Capture Fisheries (DGCF) of MMAF will be the executing \nagency  (EA)  for  the  TA  and  will  be  responsible  for  overall  TA  administration  and \nimplementation. DGCF has extensive experience and capable staff, and implemented ADB-\nfinanced projects well. DGCF\u2019s central office will provide office facilities for the administration of \nTA activities, and other administrative support services. Interagency coordination, monitoring \nand review of TA progress, and guidance to the consultants will be ensured by a steering \ncommittee  to  be  chaired  by  the  director  general  of  capture  fisheries  and  will  include \nrepresentatives  of  government  agencies  concerned,  such  as  the  National  Development \nPlanning Agency (BAPPENAS), Ministry of Finance (MOF), MMAF, DGCF, and other director \ngeneral, of MMAF. \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented over a 6-month period, from January to June 2005, by a \nteam of international (20 person-months) and domestic consultants (32 person-months). The \nexpertise  will  include  policy  and  institutional  development,  coastal  fisheries  resource \nmanagement, social and community development, microenterprise development, infrastructure \ndevelopment,  information  management,  environmental  management,  and  economics  and \nfinance. Consultants will be selected by ADB according to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants using quality- and cost-based selection. The outline terms of reference of the \nconsultants are given in Appendix 3. Simplified technical proposals will be required from short-\nlisted consulting firms. All procurement under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines for Procurement.  \n \n21.  DGCF will provide counterpart staff from MMAF and DGCF to work with the team of \nconsultants. The counterpart staff will work closely with the team of consultants to formulate and \nevaluate strategies and components for the proposed ICFRM Project and prepare detailed \nassessments  of  selected  strategies  for  ICFRM  project  interventions.  Active  involvement  of \nstakeholders, NGOs, and communities in the design of the proposed ICFRM Project will be \nsought throughout the course of the TA through workshops and focus group discussions, \nmidterm and final review missions, and regular communication.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Indonesia: \n \nAbout 36 million people are estimated to live below the poverty line in Indonesia, of whom 75% live in rural \nareas (2000). Poverty is widespread in the coastal villages, with coastal households composed mostly of \nsmall fishers, fish processors, and workers in the fishing industry and allied fields. Most of the coastal \nvillagers are highly dependent on fishing for their livelihood, with many claiming that their income from fishing \nis not sufficient to meet even their basic subsistence needs. They have limited capacity to explore new fishing \ngrounds or other opportunities for increasing fish catch and income, have limited facilities to store fishery \nproducts, lack marketing channels, and have limited transportation services. Human development is weak; \ncoastal residents have limited education and limited access to health and other basic social services such as \npotable water supply, sewerage and sanitation, electricity, and transportation. The goal of the Integrated \nCoastal Fisheries Resource Management (ICFRM) Project is to reduce poverty among coastal communities, \nimprove the management and condition of coastal and marine fisheries resources, protect the coastal and \nmarine  environment,  and  facilitate  the  participation  of  the  private  sector,  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs), and coastal communities in ICFRM and social development activities. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Poverty  \n    Classification \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?    \n   \nThe project preparatory technical assistance (TA) will assess the requirements of the \ncoastal communities and other beneficiaries for financial and technical assistance in \nICFRM interventions, particularly in microenterprise and social infrastructure development, \nand analyze the feasibility of proposed strategies and activities in poverty reduction. The \nTA will ensure that the project framework will allow for interventions and monitoring \nmechanisms to improve human development, including income, nutrition, and general \nsocial welfare. A poverty analysis will be undertaken to estimate the expected impact of \nthe Project on poor coastal communities, other stakeholders (including NGOs, community \norganizations, and other local groups), and government agencies, particularly regional \nand district governments. The analysis will include an evaluation of distribution of project \nbenefits and impacts across income groups and estimate the distribution of project effects \non the poor, as outlined in the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Handbook for Integrating \nPoverty Impact Assessment in the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nDuring the review of ongoing and completed projects, the consultants will identify and consult with all \nstakeholders and determine the roles and functions of the target groups. In particular, the consultants will \nundertake a participatory rapid appraisal (PRA) or similar approaches to gather background information on \nthe study communities, meet with key individuals and local groups, and engage them in dialogue to identify \ndevelopment needs and constraints. The outcome of the analysis will form the basis for proposing selection \ncriteria and specific mechanisms for the inclusion of communities and the identification of target groups under \nthe proposed Project. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \n \nThe TA will be implemented in a fully participatory manner. The consultants will organize and conduct a \n ", "16  Appendix 4 \nseries of stakeholder workshops at the national level and focus group discussions at each selected Project \nsite during TA implementation to solicit stakeholder inputs in the assessment of the current situation and the \ndesign of Project strategies and specific activities for incorporation in the proposed Project. \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nGender-disaggregated data will be collected during the baseline surveys to be conducted under the TA. The \npotential role of women in ICFRM and microenterprise development will be given focus, especially their \npotential role in small business development and management, strengthening of existing or creation of new \ncooperatives, and coastal and fisheries resource management initiatives. The TA will ensure that women are \nprovided with equal opportunities in training and microenterprise development, especially in the area of fish \nprocessing and marketing and other livelihood activities. \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nA gender plan will be prepared by the consultants as part of project design. The gender plan will be based on \na prior assessment of gender issues in the selected project sites and include specific interventions and \nactivities aimed at addressing identified gender issues. \n \nE.
