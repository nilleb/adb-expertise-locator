The proposed advisory technical assistance project1 is to assist the Government of the \nIslamic Republic of Pakistan to establish an integrated energy model for analyzing the impacts \nof various strategies for meeting national energy requirements. The factors addressed cover \nfinance, economics, energy supply, national resources, energy use, environmental impacts, \ntechnologies, energy efficiencies and sociopolitical impacts. National policy makers will be able \nto identify the various strategies to be examined and the modeling will support optimal decision \nmaking.  \n \n2.  A monitorable condition of the second tranche of Loan 2270-PAK (Private Participation \nin Infrastructure Program)2 calls for Pakistan\u2019s Government to complete the development of an \nintegrated energy model. The Government has requested ADB assistance to establish such a \nmodel.   \n \n3.  A  technical  assistance  (TA)  concept  note  was  circulated  on  15  May  2007.  After \nincorporation of comments, it was approved by management of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) on 22 June 2007. The Government concurs with the expected impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements and terms of reference. A notice \nrequesting  expressions  of  interest  from  consulting  firms  was  posted  on  ADB\u2019s  business \nopportunities website in July 2007.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector  includes  separate  ministries  of  Petroleum  and  Natural \nResources; Water and Power; Planning and Development; and Environment, Transport and \nCommunications. It also includes the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission. There are separate \nregulatory bodies for oil and gas, and electric power. No single ministry or regulatory body has \noverarching responsibility for energy.   \n \n5.  Pakistan\u2019s energy planning is unlikely to be optimal, or at least it is not demonstrated to \nbe so. Pakistan is a net energy importer, with energy needs supplied from multiple sources. As \nsuch,  country  energy  analysts  believe  there  is  scope  for  optimization  through  integrated \nplanning. This view is consistent with the approach of other developing and developed countries \nwhere least-cost energy plans are developed through a rigorous integrated process.   \n \n6.  Sophisticated  computer  software  applications  that  are  available  in  the  international \nmarketplace  can  model  a  country\u2019s  overall  energy  demand  and  supply  situation.  These \nintegrated energy models can help planners to assess the impacts of various policy scenarios \nand support good decision making within defined constraints. Pakistan currently does not use \nsuch an integrated energy modeling tool. \n \n7.  Pakistan\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Framework  2005\u20132010  (MTDF)  sets  out  a \nchallenging  program  to  achieve  8%  annual  growth  in  gross  domestic  product.  Associated \ngrowth in energy consumption is forecast at 12% a year, which can be compared with an annual \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 6 June 2007. \n2  ADB. 2005.

This expected growth will put pressure on all \nsectors of Pakistan\u2019s primary energy supplies. \n \n8.  Pakistan\u2019s primary energy supplies totaled 58 million tons of oil equivalent (toe) in 2005\u2013\n2006. The supplies comprise natural gas (50%), oil (28%), hydro electricity (13%), coal (7%), \nnuclear energy (1%) and liquefied petroleum gas (less than 1%). All domestic natural gas \nproduction is consumed and, without higher production, growth will need to be met through \nimports. The combination of rising oil consumption and flat oil production has led to rising oil \nimports. In addition, a lack of refining capacity leaves Pakistan heavily dependent on petroleum \nproduct imports. Electricity supply is limited due to insufficient generation availability, with an \nestimated 1,500 megawatts (MW) of demand unmet. Meanwhile, electricity demand is forecast \nto grow by 8% a year during 2005\u20132015. \n \n9.  Pakistan is responding to this energy development challenge by pursuing a wide range \nof domestic and imported energy projects. Growth in domestic gas production is not forecast to \nmeet demand. Several international gas pipeline projects are under development while liquid \nnatural gas import options are being investigated. Development of the significant but challenging \ncoal reserves in Tharparkar (Thar) Desert is being studied by the Government. Consideration is \nalso being given to 2,000 MW of power-generation projects in the private sector, using imported \ncoal. Further, the Government intends to proceed with a large multipurpose dam project on the \nIndus River to cater for irrigation needs and to supply about 8,000 MW of electric generating \ncapacity, and investigations are being conducted currently into the Central Asia South Asia \nRegional Electricity Market (CASAREM) project to import more than 2,000 MW of electricity \nfrom Tajikistan and Kyrgyz Republic via Afghanistan. Renewable energy projects are being \npromoted, with a target of 10% of energy mix to be met from such sources by 2015. Several \nenergy efficiency projects are at an early stage of development.  Meanwhile, a lack of energy \nefficiency standards has contributed to high carbon dioxide intensity.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA will support optimal energy sector development that will facilitate economic \ngrowth. The outcome will be a functioning energy planning unit producing regular integrated \nanalysis of strategic energy options. A trained energy planning team will be established. It will (i) \noperate and maintain the model and (ii) propose strategies for meeting energy requirements at \nthe least cost and in a manner that is technically and financially sustainable and environmentally \nacceptable, for consideration by national policy makers.   \n \n11.  Outputs of the energy model will be simulation results identifying the following. \n \n(i)  Least-cost energy systems.  \n(ii)  Cost-effective responses to restrictions on emissions.  \n(iii)  Long-term energy balances under different scenarios.  \n(iv)  Impact of new technologies.  \n(v)  Effects of regulations, taxes and subsidies. \n, Board (ovf iD) irectBoresn, eMfiatsn aogfe rmegeinot,n oarl  sctoaoffp, aenradt imonay.  be preliminar \n \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  Data  across  Pakistan\u2019s  energy  sector  will  be  reviewed.  This  will  include  economic, \nfinancial and technical data on (i) import and domestic energy supplies based on gas, oil, coal, \nand nuclear, as well as renewable supplies based on hydro, biomass, wind and solar; (ii) energy \nconsumption by sector and type; and (iii) environmental, efficiency, and sociopolitical matters. \nAny data omissions and/or inconsistencies will be rectified and a set of base historical and \nprojected data required as input for the integrated energy model will be produced.   \n \n13.  The consultant will review, evaluate and extract the lessons learned by similarly situated \ncountries which have used energy planning and optimization models. \n \n14.  Leading international suppliers of integrated energy models will be identified together \nwith  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  the  various  model  types  based  on  Pakistan\u2019s \nparticular needs. The options available will be reported, as will the estimated hardware and \nsoftware set-up and running costs.   \n \n15.  Should a specific model or a complementary set of models be selected, then single \nsource procurement will be used. Should several suitable alternative models be identified, then \ntender inquiry documents will be prepared and issued to pre-qualified suppliers. Procurement \nwill be (i) carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time) through limited international bidding or direct contracting; and (ii) delegated to \nthe executing agency with the full support of the TA consultant.    \n \n16.  The supplier of the integrated energy model will provide training on the model for the \n \ncounterpart team and support services during commissioning and operations. The consultant \nwill provide training on general energy planning.   \n \n17.  The consultant, together with the counterpart team, will utilize the model to examine a \nrange of alternative scenarios for energy sector development and to produce medium and long-\nterm energy plans. The consultant will coach the counterpart team to ensure an energy planning \nunit is functioning on completion of the consultant\u2019s contract. Thereafter, the energy planning \nteam  will  conduct  continuous  reviews  of  the  sector  and  issue  regular  national  integrated \nplanning reports. It is envisaged that these will be annual reports in the early years. \n   \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n18.  The TA cost estimate is $2.5 million, of which $2 million will come from ADB and $0.5 \nmillion from the Government. The ADB component will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program. See Appendix 2 for details of the cost estimates and financing plan.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  Pakistan\u2019s Planning Commission will be the executing and implementing agency. The \ncommission has sufficient resources to make offices and counterparts available for the project \nand is a possible permanent location for the future planning team.
