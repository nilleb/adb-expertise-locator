In June 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved technical assistance (TA) \nfor  capacity  building  to  the  State  Committee  for  Statistics  for  improving  the  collection  and \nanalysis of poverty data in Azerbaijan.1 In December 2001 ADB provided a second TA, for               \npreparation of a national poverty reduction strategy.2 The national strategy was subsequently \nprepared by the Government\u2019s National Program for Poverty Reduction (NPPR) Secretariat and \nendorsed  at  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Conference  held  in  Baku,  Azerbaijan,  on  25 \nOctober 2002. Prior to this conference, in May 2002, the Government of Azerbaijan requested \nADB  to  consider  a  new  TA  that  will  support  the  Government\u2019s  NPPR  Secretariat  in \nimplementing  the  new  strategy.3  The  scope,  technical  requirements,  and  implementation \narrangements of the TA were discussed and agreed with various stakeholders in Azerbaijan \nbefore  and  during  the  National  Poverty  Reduction  Conference  in  October  2002.    The  TA \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Azerbaijan had a relatively diverse economy during Soviet times, with oil, oil equipment, \nagriculture, manufacturing, and textiles as some of the main sectors. The domestic economy \nwas characterized by high unemployment and a relatively low standard of living. Economic \ndevelopment suffered a serious setback during 1991\u20131996 due to political turmoil, a military \nconflict with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh, and severe economic dislocation associated with \nthe breakup of the Soviet Union. As a consequence, real output and income fell dramatically, \ninflation was rampant, government financial resources shrank sharply, and the poverty level \nworsened significantly. Following the return of political stability in 1993 and the Government\u2019s \neconomic stabilization program in 1995, initial structural reforms began in 1996, and the overall \neconomic decline was quickly arrested. The economy has grown since then at a relatively \nrobust rate of 8.5% per year during 1996\u20132001. Real gross domestic product (GDP) grew by an \nimpressive 9.9% in 2001, and the year-on-year growth rate was 8.3% during the first half of \n2002.  This  recent  economic  growth  has  been  almost  entirely  driven  by  the  resumption  of \nproduction in the oil and oil-related sectors. \n \n3.  The main challenge for the Government in the new millennium is how to consolidate and \nbuild from these gains, while addressing the serious poverty situation in the country. According \nto latest data from the 2001 household survey, the poverty head count was 49% in 2001. In \naddition, the new data indicate that an estimated 17% of Azerbaijanis lived in extreme poverty in \n2001. The findings of the survey have been used to build up a poverty profile for Azerbaijan, \nwhich indicates that (i) the poverty head count appears to have improved somewhat since the \nlast income survey in 1995, but direct comparison is not possible due to differences in the \nmethodology used; (ii) individuals in urban households have a higher risk of being poor than \nthose in rural households; (iii) gender does not appear to be a significant factor, with males and \nfemales having an almost equal probability of being poor; and (iv) households headed by a \nperson with internally displaced or refugee status have a significantly higher risk of poverty than \nother households. \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Technical Assistance to Azerbaijan for Preparation of the Medium-Term National Poverty Reduction \nStrategy, Manila. TA 3788 for $150,000.  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities, Internet Edition, on 21 November 2002.  ", "2 \n4.  Despite good economic progress and decreased poverty in recent years, the quality of \nlife appears to be deteriorating in Azerbaijan. Although, Azerbaijan\u2019s human development index \nimproved marginally from 0.738 in 1999 to 0.741 in 2000,4 social indicators have not improved \nsignificantly in recent years. The main reason for the lack of improvement is the continuing \ndecline in the budget for social services, in particular for health care and education, compared to \nthe levels existing during the Soviet period. For instance, the Government budget for health care \nrepresented only 1.0% of GDP in 1999, compared to 1.5% in 1996 and 2.6% in 1990. Likewise, \nstate education expenditure in 1999 was 3.4% of GDP, a decline from 6.9% in 1990. Better \nquality  public  services  and  efficient  allocation  of  budgets  are  needed  to  sustain  the \nachievements in the past and improve human capital development in the country. \n \n5.  To address the poverty and quality of life situation in the country, the Government \nformally launched the National Program for Poverty Reduction (NPPR) in June 2001. An NPPR \nsecretariat was established to guide the process of preparing the NPPR and 15 sector working \ngroups were formed to prepare the sector inputs for the NPPR. The final NPPR5 was prepared \non the basis of these inputs and unveiled at the National Poverty Reduction Conference held in \nBaku, Azerbaijan, on 25 October 2002. The NPPR was formally approved by a Presidential \nDecree on 20 February 2003. The NPPR covers a 3-year implementation period (until the end \nof 2005) and presents a comprehensive set of policy measures to tackle poverty in the country. \nADB assisted the Government in preparing the final document, through the NPPR secretariat \nand five of the sector working groups, as well as financing of a national workshop and the \nconference.6 Overall, despite difficulties in securing the inputs in some sectors, a significant \namount of capacity has been built during the preparation phase, particularly in areas such as \npoverty  monitoring  and  public  participation.  Just  as  importantly,  the  Government  has \ndemonstrated a reassuringly strong commitment to the poverty reduction strategy process. \n \n6.  The Government has been preparing for the implementation phase of the NPPR. For \nthis  phase,  a  new  secretariat,  the  State  Programme  for  Poverty  Reduction  and  Economic \nDevelopment (SPPRED) Secretariat, was created in January 2003. The new secretariat, within \nthe  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  (MOED),  has  been  strengthened  to  have  overall \nresponsibility  for  coordinating  and  monitoring  the  NPPR  implementation  process.  This \nsecretariat will be responsible for: (i) coordinating the NPPR policy measures among various \ngovernment  agencies,  and  coordination  of  externally  funded  activities  in  support  of  the \nimplementation of the NPPR; (ii) monitoring the implementation of the NPPR policy measures; \n(iii)  overseeing  the  work  of  the  poverty  monitoring  unit,  which  will  be  incorporated  in  the \nSPPRED secretariat; (iv) continuing the participatory process initiated in the preparation phase \nof the NPPR to build greater stakeholder awareness; and (v) ensuring a close link between \nNPPR policy measures and macroeconomic policies. \n \n7.  To fulfill the above roles, the SPPRED secretariat will require considerable capacity \nbuilding  in  poverty  monitoring,  sectoral  policy  development,  human  capital  development, \nresettlement of internally displaced persons and refugees, macroeconomic, the financial sector, \ndecentralization and municipal development, social protection, and participatory approaches. In \nterms  of  staffing  requirements,  the  Government  estimates  that  seven  international  long-to-\n                                                 \n4  United  Nations  Development Programme. 2001.

", "    3 \nmedium-term experts, a series of short-term experts, eight local experts, and five local support \nstaff, will be required during the implementation period. \n \n8.  The TA is being proposed to help the Government implement its medium-term poverty \nreduction strategy through capacity building of the new SPPRED secretariat. ADB has closely \ncoordinated with other funding agencies that are likely to be involved in the implementation \nphase to ensure all the assistances are complementary.  A joint aide memoire was signed by \nADB,  the  World  Bank  (WB),  and  the  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  in \nOctober  2002  and  set  out  a  coherent  operational  framework  and  financing  plan  for  the \nimplementation phase of the NPPR. \n \n9.  In parallel with the proposed assistance for the implementation of the SPPRED, ADB is \ninitiating its poverty reduction partnership process in Azerbaijan. A poverty reduction partnership \nagreement is scheduled for finalization in the second half of 2003. The proposed TA will assist \nin this effort through inputs by the international expert and building government capacity for \nsubsequent poverty reduction partnership agreement implementation and monitoring. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n10.  The  long-term  goal  of  the  TA  is  to  reduce  poverty  in  Azerbaijan  through  the \nimplementation of a comprehensive  medium-term poverty reduction strategy. The purpose of \nthe TA is to support the Government in implementing this medium-term strategy, ensuring \nbroad-based participation of the major stakeholders in the strategy implementation process. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The goal and purpose of the TA will be pursued by: \n \n(i)  assistance to develop a well-functioning SPPRED secretariat capable of fulfilling \nits  functions,  including  monitoring  of  the  implementation  of  the  NPPR  policy \nmeasures; \n \n(ii)  provision of cross-cutting support in areas such as assistance to refugees and \ninternally displaced persons, trade and poverty, social development and poverty, \nenvironment and poverty, and macroeconomic issues; \n \n(iii)  support for a training program to enhance the skills of the SPPRED secretariat \nstaff, particularly in pro-poor budgeting, standard poverty analysis techniques, \nand other areas identified in the training needs assessment; and \n \n(iv)  support to the participatory process through assistance for organizing regional \nseminars and meetings to further the dialogue between policy makers and civil \nsociety and build stakeholders\u2019 awareness of the importance of implementing the \nNPPR. \n \n12.  Specific policy areas to be addressed may include in-depth studies on poverty-related \nissues related to agriculture and rural development, social sectors, and internally displaced \npersons.  The TA outputs will be disseminated through publication of annual and quarterly \nreviews and meetings and seminars. ", "4 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The  estimated  TA  cost  is  $815,000  equivalent,  of  which  $578,000  is  the  foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $237,000  equivalent  is  the  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance $650,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost of \n$578,000 and $72,000 equivalent of local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost equivalent of $165,000 by providing office space, staff support, and other in-kind \ncontributions. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The MOED will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The Implementing Agency will be \nthe SPPRED secretariat, under MOED, which is responsible for the day-to-day implementation \nof the TA. To guide the work of the SPPRED secretariat, the Government will establish an \nadvisory board. The advisory board will be chaired by the minister of economic development, \nand will comprise members from Government, funding agencies, and civil society. Given ADB\u2019s \npast assistance to poverty reduction in Azerbaijan, the Government is very likely to offer ADB a \npermanent seat on the advisory board. In January 2003, the Government issued a resolution \ncreating the SPPRED Secretariat. Shortly after the commencement of activities of the SPPRED \nSecretariat in the first quarter of 2003, the Government will appoint the advisory board. The TA \nis expected to be completed by 30 June 2005. \n \n15.  In continuation of the NPPR secretariat\u2019s role, the new SPPRED secretariat has taken \nthe lead in coordinating external assistance in the NPPR implementation process. The main \nfunding  agencies  (UNDP,  WB,  and  ADB)  have  agreed  to  coordinate  their  activities  in  the \nimplementation of the SPPRED. Specifically, UNDP\u2019s assistance will focus on supporting the \npoverty monitoring unit attached to the SPPRED secretariat. WB, through the Swiss Trust Fund, \nwill finance short-term experts and fund two conferences and a number of workshops. ADB staff \nwill  continue  to  liaise  with  WB,  UNDP,  and  other  major  fund  agencies,  to  ensure  close \ncoordination. \n \n16.  Consulting services for 66 person-months are required (18 for international and 48 for \ndomestic consultants) in the areas of poverty reduction strategy implementation, agriculture and \nrural development, and human capital development. The consultants will be engaged on an \nindividual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The consultants \nwill  follow  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines for Procurement  when  procuring  equipment.  The international \nconsultant  is  expected  to  work  fulltime  during  the  first  year  of  TA  implementation  and \nintermittently during the second year. The two domestic consultants will work fulltime during the \nimplementation period. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  As the team leader, the international consultant will be responsible for regular reporting \nof TA activities during the implementation period, as follows. First, the international consultant \nwill submit an inception report within 2 weeks of commencement of assignment and will provide \nprogress reports on a quarterly basis to MOED, the SPPRED Secretariat, and ADB. Second, \nthe international consultant will submit two interim reports to coincide with the work to be \naccomplished for the annual review of implementation of the NPPR at the end of each calendar \nyear.  Third,  the  international  consultant  will  submit  special  reports  in  advance  of  periodic \ntripartite assessments or following completion of key activities, as needed. These reports will ", "    5 \nform the basis for ADB review missions to engage the Government on issues affecting TA \nimplementation. Finally, the international consultant will consolidate the final reports of all the \nconsultants and submit this to the Government and ADB upon completion of the TA. This report \nwill include the accomplishments of the TA and assessment of the results achieved in meeting \nthe TA objectives. Detailed information on reporting requirements is provided in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Azerbaijan  for  Capacity  Building  for  Medium-Term  Poverty  Reduction \nStrategy Implementation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \n     \nPoverty reduction in  Reduction of poverty  National household \nAzerbaijan  incidence by 2010  surveys \n     \nImprovement in non- Regional surveys \nincome poverty \nperformance by 2010  \nImprovement in \ndelivery of social \nprotection measures to \ntargeted vulnerable \nand socially excluded \ngroups \nPurpose       \n       \nSupport the  Formulation and  Periodic tripartite  Continued strong \nGovernment in the  passage of decrees,  assessment by  political commitment \nimplementation of its  resolutions, and/or  representatives from  for the implementation \nmedium-term poverty  other legislation that  the Government, Asian  of the national poverty \nreduction strategy  pertain to improving  Development Bank,  reduction strategy \n  living standards and  and stakeholders \nthe implementation   \nphase  Technical completion \n  report \n \nOutputs       \n1.
