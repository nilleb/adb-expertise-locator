The  Government  of  Uzbekistan  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \nprovide technical assistance (TA)1 for capacity development to strengthen (i) the monitoring \ncapacity for projects financed by ADB, other international financial institutions, and foreign \ninvestors; and (ii) debt management capacity.  \n \n2.  In August 2012, ADB fielded a fact-finding mission to discuss possible ADB assistance \nwith the Ministry for Foreign Economic Relations, Investments, and Trade (MFERIT) and the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF). The government and the mission reached an understanding on the \nscope, impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, \nand terms of reference for the consultants. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix \n1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Uzbekistan's economy has been growing strongly since 2004. Diversifying the economy \nthrough industrial development, especially through private sector mobilization, has become the \ncountry\u2019s priority. To meet the needs for physical infrastructure development and nonphysical \ninstitutional strengthening, Uzbekistan is significantly increasing borrowing from ADB and other \ninternational financial institutions.  \n \n4.  Since 1996 when ADB began lending to Uzbekistan, 44 public sector loans totaling $3.3 \nbillion have been approved.2 The current country portfolio contains 20 projects with 24 active \nloans for $2.21 billion that provide support to seven sectors. The transport sector accounts for \nthe  largest  share  of  ADB  assistance  (40%),  followed  by  energy  (23%),  water  supply  and \nsanitation (13%), agriculture and natural resources (11%), multisector (9%), finance (3%), and \neducation (1%). ADB has recently expanded its operation, and provided four public loans ($655 \nmillion)  in  2010  and  six  public  loans  ($878  million)  in  2011.  Meanwhile,  the  World  Bank \napproved three loans totaling $291 million in 2011, which is the largest amount it has provided \nin a single year. The Japan International Cooperation Agency resumed its loan operation in \n2010 and has provided $250 million on average in each fiscal year since then. \n \n5.  To ensure timely delivery of results under the increased operations, greater efforts are \nrequired to improve project monitoring and portfolio management. Though the government has \na high-level portfolio monitoring structure in place, performance is shown to be on track in only \nhalf of the ADB-funded projects in 2012. Further efforts are required to strengthen the project \nmonitoring  and  portfolio  management  capacity.  The  Department  of  Monitoring  of \nImplementation on Foreign Investments and Projects (DMIFIP) of the MFERIT is responsible for \nmonitoring, reviewing, and analyzing portfolio performance on a quarterly basis to identify key \nimplementation issues.3 However, the current monitoring system requires manual collection of \ninformation  in  spreadsheets  from  executing  agencies.  The  DMIFIP  needs  to  develop  a \nmonitoring database, since it is of great importance to ensure appropriate and efficient use of \nforeign funds in implementing the strategic objectives of the government\u2019s development policy. \nTimely acquisition of data on project implementation progress and prompt addressing of issues \nare crucial to achieving better portfolio management.  \n                                                \n1 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 July 2013. \n2 As of 31 December 2012. \n3 The Ministry of Economy takes overall responsibility for portfolio management covering both domestic and foreign-\nfunded  projects.  The  MFERIT  is  responsible  for  foreign-funded  project  performance  and  reports  on  project \nimplementation issues to the Ministry of Economy. \n ", "2       \n6.  To assist the government in improving its portfolio performance monitoring system, it is \nimportant  to  strengthen  the  DMIFIP\u2019s  capacity  to  coordinate  with  executing  agencies  and \ndevelop  a  unified  monitoring  system.  This  system  will  enable  the  DMIFIP  and  executing \nagencies  to  (i)  establish  a  database  of  foreign-assisted  projects  to  monitor  and  improve \nperformance, and (ii) identify causes of delays in project implementation in a timely manner, \nenable resolution of the issues, and bring the project back on schedule, and (iii) give priority to \nimproving overall portfolio performance of foreign-assisted projects in a sustainable manner.    \n   \n7.  Given the country\u2019s growing debt portfolio and shift to less-concessional funding, there is \nalso  a  need  to  strengthen  Uzbekistan\u2019s  public  debt  management.  The  government  has \nintroduced a number of measures to strengthen the capacity of the MOF by building a strategic \nand operational framework for debt management. The role of the Public External Debt Division \n(PEDD) of the MOF in accounting, auditing, and fund flow management has expanded, and its \naccountability as a service provider to line ministries is becoming more clearly defined. Effective \nmanagement of data on domestic and external public debt is crucial. This will necessitate the \ncompilation and processing of all debt-related data to enable reliable and complete internal and \nexternal  reporting  on  debt  and  related  issues.  However,  information  is  currently  manually \nrecorded and maintained, which is not suitable for real-time debt management and analysis.  \n \n8.  There is therefore a need for appropriate information technology systems to support \neffective  debt  management.  Strengthening  the  capacity  of  the  PEDD  and  adopting  an \ninternationally recognized and used debt management system, such as the Debt Management \nand Financial Analysis System (DMFAS),4 will enable the MOF to develop a debt database \ncontaining detailed and aggregated data on loan contracts, bonds and grants, real operations \n(disbursements and debt service), as well as future operations. As the system can process large \nquantities of data, more time and energy can be deployed on analytical and management tasks.  \n \n9.  The TA will address the need to improve the project monitoring management capacity, \nand improve the advanced debt management system to support the country\u2019s macroeconomic \nobjectives. The TA is aligned with ADB's country partnership strategy, 2012\u201320165 and is \nincluded in the country operations business plan, 2012\u20132014 for Uzbekistan,6 which highlights \nthe need for capacity development in the overall management of the development process. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The impact of the proposed TA will be improved aid management in Uzbekistan. The \nfocus will be on the portfolio of foreign-assisted projects and debt management recording. The \noutcome will be strengthened capacity for project and debt management within the government.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The TA will have the following components: (i) an established project management \ninformation system (PMIS) for ADB-funded projects and other foreign-assisted projects, and \n                                                \n4  The DMFAS is a software package that can be used for recording, monitoring, reporting, and analysis. Usually \ninstalled in the finance ministry and/or central bank, it supports both external and domestic public debt (loans and \nsecurities), whether this be short, medium, or long term. It also provides coverage for private debt, grants, and \nonlent loans. The DMFAS program is a world leader in provision of technical cooperation and advisory services in \nthe area of debt management.   \n5  ADB. 2012.

Manila. \n ", "  3 \n (ii) updated debt management recording of the MOF through use of the DMFAS.  \n \n12.  Component 1 of the TA will support the following key activities: (i) review and select the \nproposed computerized PMIS based on inputs from the technical working team (para. 16) and \nreports available in the MFERIT, (ii) procure hardware and software for the PMIS, (iii) establish \na project database, (iv) establish an online monitoring system for line ministries\u2019 evaluation of \nforeign-assisted project performance, and (v) train relevant agencies in preparing data and \nrunning the system. A new monitoring framework will be established with development partners \nfor effective portfolio management. \n \n13.  Component 2 will support the following key activities: (i) review the current workload of \nthe MOF to transfer the existing debt management system to the DMFAS; (ii) procure software \nand hardware to employ the DMFAS; and (iii) migrate all data to the DMFAS and conduct \nworkshops and training for local staff on the debt analysis functionality of the DMFAS. The \nMOF, through the new debt management system, will be able to provide debt information \nregularly and more frequently, and start to analyze debt portfolio in depth for debt sustainability. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which $900,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office and workshop spaces, and other in-\nkind contributions. The government will also bear the cost of taxes and duties for imported \nequipment. The details of cost estimates are in Appendix 2. All disbursements under the TA will \nbe  made  in  accordance  with  the  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  The MFERIT will be the executing agency and will act as the overall coordinator of the \nTA, which will start in September 2013 and run for 12 months. The deputy minister of the \nMFERIT will be appointed as project director and oversee TA implementation. The MFERIT will \nestablish  the  project  management  unit  (PMU)  in  its  head  office  to  manage  project \nimplementation. The executing agency will (i) coordinate with ADB the schedule and process of \nprocurement and recruitment of consultants, (ii) prepare periodic progress reports based on \ninputs from project coordinators, (iii) monitor and evaluate the TA activities, and (iv) develop a \ntraining  program together  with  the  software  provider. The  deputy  minister  of  the  MFERIT, \nassisted by the PMU, will lead coordination with the MOF to implement the TA. A working group \nwith members representing the MOF will be established for component 2 coordination.  \n \n16.  For component 1, the MFERIT will be the implementing agency and will assign one of its \nstaff as project coordinator. The project coordinator will undertake the following: (i) financial \nmanagement for component 1, (ii) preparation of periodic reports to be submitted to the PMU, \nand (iii) training on project monitoring and portfolio management for the MFERIT and project \nexecuting agency officials. The implementing agency will deploy the following counterpart staff \nto work with the PMU: (i) project coordinator for component 1, (ii) hardware specialist, (iii) \napplication software administrator, (iv) policies development and implementation staff, and (v) \ntraining staff (two persons). All the staff will be permanently assigned to sustain the system and \noperate the database established under the TA. The role of the project coordinator will change \nafter completion of the TA, when the coordinator will become the manager for the PMIS. The \ntechnical working team will be established with members from all relevant departments within \nthe MFERIT and line ministries managing foreign-assisted projects. The technical working team \n ", "4       \nwill meet routinely, but at least once a month, to work on PMIS technical matters. The PMIS will \nbe developed based on inputs from the technical working team, recommendations from the \nneeds assessment, and other available reports in the MFERIT. The implementing agency, with \nassistance from the PMU consultants, will coordinate with ADB the procurement process of the \nsoftware  and  hardware  for  the  PMIS,  conduct  training  and  workshops  as  part  of  the  TA \nimplementation, and run the PMIS trial and dissemination. \n \n17.  A  lesson  learned from previous  TA  projects7 is  to  avoid  selecting  an implementing \nagency such as cabinet of ministers which only has a coordinating role. The MFERIT is an \noversight ministry but has clear responsibility for overall portfolio performance of foreign-funded \nprojects and can be further involved in procurement processes of those projects at various \nstages. The MFERIT is considered the most appropriate agency to implement the TA. \n \n18.  For component 2, the MOF will be the implementing agency and will assign one of its \nofficials as the project coordinator. The project coordinator will be responsible for implementing \ncomponent 2, including financial management, preparing periodic reports, and assuring the \nquality of information to be provided to the PMU. The PEDD will establish a technical working \nteam, if needed, with members from all relevant agencies involved in debt management. The \nimplementing agency, with assistance from the consultants, will be responsible for coordinating \nwith  ADB  the  procurement  process  for  software  and  hardware  for  the  DMFAS.  The \nimplementing agency, with assistance from the consultants and the software supplier, will be \nalso responsible for conducting trainings and workshops as part of the TA implementation, and \nmaintaining and running the DMFAS program to produce required outputs on debt information \nand analysis. The role of the project coordinator will change after completion of the TA, and the \ncoordinator will become the manager for the DMFAS.  \n \n19.  Each  implementing  agency  will  hold  separate  responsibilities  for  (i)  efficient  and \ncomprehensive  financial  management for  each  component,  and  (ii)  high-quality  and  timely \ndelivery of the necessary reporting for each component. The project coordinators, who are \nauthorized persons from the implementing agency, will undertake these responsibilities. \n \n20.  ADB will engage one international consultant (2.5 person-months) as a team leader, and \none national consultant (9.0 person-months) as a deputy team leader; they will both assist in the \nimplementation of components 1 and 2. Consultants will be recruited on an individual basis in \naccordance with the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime). Consultancy services will be delivered intermittently. \n \n21.  The international consultant, acting as the team leader, will assist in implementing the \nTA in close consultation and coordination with the executing agency. Responsibilities of the \nteam leader include (i) preparing the implementation plan; (ii) preparing the inception, final, and \nother  reports  to  be  submitted  to  ADB;  (iii)  monitoring  overall  TA  implementation;  and  (iv) \ntogether  with  the  software  provider,  developing  a  training  program  on  project  portfolio \nmanagement for MFERIT and executing and implementing agency officials; and (iv) providing \nguidance on the procurement process. The national consultant acting as the deputy team leader \nwill assist the team leader with day-to-day TA activities and implementation of components 1 \nand 2.  \n \n22.  Procurement of hardware and software with related services will be made by ADB and \ncarried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to \n                                                \n7  ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n ", "  5 \ntime).  All  software  and  equipment  will  be  handed  over  to  implementing  agencies  upon \ncompletion of the TA. The government assures that necessary operation and subscription costs \nwill be borne by the government and the hardware and software will be maintained and updated \nat its own expense. \n \n23.  Component  1.  The  procurement  of  software,  hardware,  and  related  services \n(installation, testing, and training) for the MFERIT will be carried out by ADB in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The MFERIT will supervise test running of the hardware and \nsoftware conducted by the suppliers. The implementing agency for component 1 will issue the \ncertificate of acceptance after installation and running tests are satisfactorily completed.  \n \n24.  Component 2. The DMFAS, the software, and related services (installation, testing, and \ntraining) for the MOF will be procured directly9 from the United Nations Conference on Trade \nand  Development  (UNCTAD)  for  the  following  reasons:  (i)  the  DMFAS  is  internationally \nrecognized debt management software which meets the government\u2019s technical requirements; \n(ii) the DMFAS is the only major debt management software which has been installed in former \nSoviet Union countries; (iii) the DMFAS has strong partnerships with all major international \norganizations in debt management (such as the International Monetary Fund and the World \nBank), reflecting their initiatives to improve debt management; (iv) sensitivity of handling debt \ndata in Uzbekistan requires that parties involved in the procurement and implementation of \ncomponent 2 are neutral and confidential, and their number is kept to a minimum (UNCTAD \nmeets this requirement); (v) preparation of a bidding document involving private consultants and \ndisclosure of the debt-related information to bidders for the procurement may be considered \nundesirable because of the sensitivity of the data; (vi) UNCTAD is the only debt management \nsoftware package supplier which is neither a private firm nor a foreign-government-related \nagency; (vii) the DMFAS is the only software currently available in a Russian version; (viii) the \nDMFAS can only be used with an agreement with UNCTAD; and (ix) UNCTAD is the sole \nsupplier of the DMFAS. The TA will support the subscription costs of using the DMFAS for 3 \nyears. The implementing agency for component 2 will issue the certificate of acceptance after \ninstallation and running tests are satisfactorily completed. \n \n25.  The DMFAS is a package which includes training and other related services which are \nclosely linked to the debt management software itself. Thus, it is not efficient to separate the \ncapacity development component from the software procurement package. The  completion \nreport for Capacity Building of the Development Aid and Debt Management\u2019s Debt Management \nUnit10 recommends combining three interventions, where software procurement and subsequent \ntrainings (direct contracting with the software supplier) were separately granted, into one TA \nproject for reasons of cost effectiveness.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION  \n \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Uzbekistan for Improving Portfolio and Debt Management System, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.   \n                                                \n9  Following  clause  3.6  (Direct  Contracting)  and  clause  3.9  (Procurement  from  Specialized  Agencies)  of  the \nProcurement Guidelines. \n10  ADB. 2006.
