INTRODUCTION\n1. The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  its  Microfinance  Development\nStrategy  (MDS)  in  June  2000.1  The  MDS  emphasizes  the  importance  of  developing\nsustainable  microfinance  to  fully  harness  the  potential  of  microfinance  for  poverty\nreduction in the Asian and Pacific Region. The extent of poverty reduction impact of\nmicrofinance will depend mainly on the scale and scope of services. The outreach of\nservice providers can be expanded on a sustainable basis only if they adopt a commercial\napproach. However, neither the commercialization, defined as the expansion of profit-\ndriven, market-based financial institutions serving the microfinance market, nor its various\nfacets and implications for the microfinance industry are well understood by microfinance\nstakeholders in the Region. This paper outlines a regional technical assistance (TA)\ndesigned  to  facilitate  a  better  understanding  of  the  process  of  commercializing\nmicrofinance, and its many facets and implications.\n2. The TA paper is based on a review of the microfinance market developments in\nthe  Region  carried  out  during  the  preparation  of  the  MDS.  Further  information  for\npreparation of the paper was gathered during the TA Fact-Finding Mission during 12\u201325\nJuly  2000  in  Bangladesh  and  Indonesia.2  The  Fact-Finding  Mission  conducted\nconsultations  with  microfinance  practitioners,  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),\npolicymakers,  and  representatives  of  other  funding  agencies  on  the  concept  of\ncommercialization and the scope of the TA.3\nII.          BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Microfinance is considered an important tool in poverty reduction. Microfinance\ncan make a potentially significant contribution to poverty reduction by, among other things,\nenabling an increasing number of poor households to access financial services on a\ncontinuing  basis  to  make  better  use  of  investment  opportunities,  build  assets,  and\nsmoothen household consumption (footnote 1, pp. 2-3). Currently, it is estimated that,\ndespite the growth of microfinance operations over the last two decades, no more than 10\npercent of poor households in the Region have access to institutional sources of finance.\nOver 90 percent of clients with access to institutional microfinance are concentrated in\nBangladesh and Indonesia.4 Many microfinance institutions (MFIs), including those in\nBangladesh and Indonesia, still provide only limited services. For example, few MFIs\nprovide microinsurance services. Microcredit operations of many microfinance or credit\ninstitutions are also limited in scope. In many cases, initial loan amounts and subsequent\nincreases to the loan amounts are predetermined by the lending institutions and applied\nuniformly to all borrowers. The maturity of loans is fixed by the lending institutions without\ntaking into account client preferences. The menu of credit products is not diversified to\nreflect the diversity of demand. Often loans are not given for purposes such as housing\nand consumption. It is also generally recognized that even microenterprises have been\nexcluded from the services of many MFIs, with the exception of the unit desas of the Bank\n                                                \n1 R106-00: Finance for the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy, 6 June.\n2 Fact-finding  missions  to  the  Philippines  and  Sri  Lanka  were  considered  not  necessary  because  a\nsubstantial amount of information was collected on the microfinance industry of these countries by the\nmission during formulation of the MDS in 1999.\n3  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities in December 1999.\n4 It is tentatively estimated that about 7 million in Bangladesh and 10 million households in Indonesia have\naccess to institutional microfinance services.", "2\nRakyat Indonesia, in part due to self-imposed loan ceilings.5 Many MFIs adopt lending\nmethodologies that impose high transaction costs on their clients.\n4. Most MFIs do not adopt a commercial approach to pricing their products and\nservices, and consider their operations as commercial. The dominant view among the\nservice providers in many developing member countries (DMCs) appears to be that social\nconsiderations  should  predominate  and  overshadow  profit  concerns  because  their\noperations target poor households. As a result, interest rates charged by many MFIs are\ninsufficient to cover their operating costs. The pricing policies do not aim to protect the\nerosion  of  capital  from  inflation.6  Similarly,  the  emphasis  on  operational  efficiency  is\ninadequate. Therefore, many MFIs require continued subsidies if they are to remain in\nbusiness.  Another  important  aspect  is  the  heavy  reliance  on  concessional  funds  for\nlending operations. For example, by 31 December 1999, such funds accounted for about\n43 percent of the loanable funds for the microfinance industry in Bangladesh. The policy\nenvironment in some DMCs is also an impediment to adopting commercial practices. The\nceilings on interest rates in the People\u2019s Republic of China and Viet Nam for microcredit\nare a case in point.\n5. The  supply-driven  approach  is  coming  under  increasing  pressure  in  countries\nwhere  competition  in  the  market  place  has  improved.  Thus,  in  Bangladesh,  client\ndesertion has become a serious problem for some major MFIs. The clients appear to\nshow little loyalty to the institution when it does not fully meet their demand and there are\nbetter alternatives at low switching costs. Also in a competitive environment, clients tend\nto obtain credit from a number of institutions and become overindebted with adverse\nconsequences on their loan repayment capacity. Some MFIs in Bangladesh have thus\nbeen experiencing a decline in their loan recovery rates, which have been generally over\n95 percent and the hallmark of their operations.\n6. MFIs are also being subjected to increasing pressure to improve the depth of their\noutreach in line with increasing concerns for poverty reduction. The call to enhance the\ndepth of outreach is made in a context where financial sustainability is also emphasized.\nThe strong demand for financial viability of service providers suggests that the long-term\nprospects for concessional external funding for MFIs that are not committed to achieving\nfinancial  viability  may  be  bleak.  Traditionally  the  MFIs  in  the  Region  have  not  been\nsubjected to this kind of pressure. Many operated in a noncompetitive market situation\nwith relatively easy access to concessional funding. They perceived the potential market\nas unlimited, given the extensive use of informal sources by the poor for their financial\nservices and the very high interest rates charged on microcredit by the informal sector\nsuppliers. The MFIs primarily see their mission as a social one based on paternalistic\napproaches.  High  loan  recovery  rates  were  seen  as  an  adequate  measure  of  their\noperational efficiency.7 This perception of their operations did not require MFIs to adopt\ncost recovery interest rates or pursue operational efficiency with a significant commitment.\n7. The microfinance industry in most countries in the Region began with grant funds\nor funds provided at highly concessional interest rates by various funding agencies and\n                                                \n5 A  few  large  NGOs  in  Bangladesh  have  recently  introduced  new  programs  to  provide  loans  to\nmicroenterprises.\n6 Calmeadow. 2000. The Microbanking Bulletin, No. 4. Calmeadow, Washington, DC.\n7 However, many MFIs did not correctly measure and report loan recoveries. See CGAP. 1999. Measuring\nMicrocredit Delinquency: Ratios Can be Harmful to Your Health.  Occasional  Paper  No.  3.  CGAP,\nWashington, DC.", "3\ngovernments.  Most  MFIs  continue  to  rely  on  such  funds  to  sustain  their  operations.\nHowever,  this  approach  does  not  encourage  them  to  achieve  financial  viability.  As\nhighlighted  in  ADB\u2019s  Rural  Asia  Study,8  it  is  evident  that  a  commercial  approach  is\nessential for microfinance development if the services are to be expanded to reach a\nmajority of the excluded clients and to provide a wide array of services to those who\ncurrently  have  access  to  a  limited  range  of  services  on  a  sustainable  basis.  In  the\nabsence of commercial approaches, the prospects of reaching a majority of the potential\nclients with quality and diverse services on a permanent basis will decline over time.\n8. Although the commercialization of microfinance can potentially contribute to the\nexpansion of the outreach over time, it is not a simple, straightforward process of rapidly\nincreasing  the  degree  of  market  reliance  of  MFIs  and  replacing  their  supply-driven\napproach with a demand-driven approach. Commercialization means dramatic changes\nfor  existing  MFIs  in  their  approach  to  the  provision  of  microfinance  services  and\nmobilization of resources; internal organizational structure including delivery mechanisms,\ntype  of  services,  and  governance;  and  pricing  policies.  The  domestic  resource\nmobilization through public voluntary deposits raises major operational and legal issues in\nparticular where NGOs play a dominant role in the industry.\n9. The commercialization of the Region\u2019s microfinance industry may also require new\ninstitutions to enter this market based on its profit potential. Although it has generally been\nassumed that the increasing level of competition in the formal banking sector will drive the\ntraditional  regulated  financial  institutions  to  enter  this  segment  of  the  market,  these\ninstitutions have been slow to penetrate this market segment. In most countries the\nregulated financial institutions with private risk capital do not seem to show a noticeable\ninterest  in  this  market.9  Many  MFIs  have also  not  been  able  to  establish  significant\ncommercial links with private commercial banks.10 It is possible that this may be due to the\nlack of knowledge of commercial prospects in the market by the traditional regulated\ninstitutions, or predominance of noncommercial operators that undermine the incentives\nfor private capital to enter the market. Obviously, MFIs with access to adequate grants or\nsubsidized funds have little incentive to establish commercial links.\n10. Given the status of the microfinance industry, three broad sets of issues appear to\nbe important for commercializing microfinance in the Region. The first set relates to how\nthe existing microfinance NGOs can be motivated to increase their commercial orientation\nwhile  expanding  their  services  to  the  poor.  The  second  set  relates  to  how  private,\ncommercially oriented financial institutions can be encouraged to enter this market based\non its profit potential. The third set relates to the impact of commercialization on providing\nservices to an increasing segment of the poor. To address these issues, MFIs, potential\ninvestors,  and  funding  agencies  require  a  better  understanding  of  the  process  of\ncommercialization with its implications and challenges.\n                                                \n8 ADB. 2000.

Bank Dagang Bali entered this\nmarket in 1970 and has been playing a significant role particularly in mobilizing microsavings. See ADB.\n2000.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n11. The  objectives  of  the  TA  are  to  (i)  carry  out  a  thorough  analysis  of\ncommercialization  of  the  microfinance  industry;  (ii)  provide  an  opportunity  for  the\nstakeholders in microfinance to discuss the issues involved in commercialization; and (iii)\nmake  recommendations  on  appropriate  approaches  to  the  commercialization  of\nmicrofinance. The TA framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nB.  Scope\n12. The TA covers four countries: Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines, and Sri Lanka.\nThese countries are selected to represent ADB\u2019s East and West regions and different\nstages of commercialization. The TA consists of three components: (i) country studies on\nthe status, process, and implications of commercialization of microfinance; (ii) in-country\nworkshops to discuss the country studies and country-specific institutional experience in\nthe commercialization of microfinance; and (iii) a regional workshop to discuss each\ncountry-study and institutional experiences in a comparative context.\n13. The country studies will focus on the historical process and the current status of\nthe commercialization of the microfinance industry; major factors that have influenced the\nprocess;  constraints  on,  and  prospects  for,  commercialization;  and  the  medium-term\noutlook  for,  and  the  implications  of,  commercialization.  The  country  studies  will  also\nexamine different perspectives of major stakeholders on commercialization through focus\ngroup discussions.\n14. The  country-level  workshops  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  a  broad  range  of\nmicrofinance stakeholders in each country included in the TA to discuss the respective\ncountry studies and country-specific institutional experiences with commercialization. The\nspecific institutional experiences will be presented by key staff of the concerned MFIs at\nthe invitation of ADB.\n15. The regional workshop will focus on comparative aspects of the commercialization\nof microfinance in the four countries covered by the TA. For this purpose, a comparative\nstudy paper will be prepared for presentation at the regional workshop, based on the\ncountry studies. The regional workshop will also discuss a selected case study from each\ncountry to enrich the discussion on comparative aspects and make recommendations on\nappropriate approaches to promote the commercialization.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The total cost of the TA is estimated at $700,000 and will be financed by ADB on a\ngrant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. Detailed\ncost estimates are given in Appendix 2.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n17. ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA.  The  Agriculture  and  Rural\nDevelopment Division West (AWAR) will be responsible for TA implementation. AWAR will\ncoordinate closely with the Agriculture and Social Sectors Department East, and other", "5\ndepartments and offices involved in microfinance operations in the respective countries.\nADB\u2019s resident missions in each of the countries included in the TA will assist AWAR in\norganizing the country workshops. In addition, the Indonesia Resident Mission will assist\nAWAR in organizing the regional workshop to be held in Indonesia.\n18. The country studies and the comparative regional study will be placed on the ADB\nweb site to provide access to the studies to a wide audience. The country-level workshops\nwill allow for wider participation of stakeholders in microfinance including NGOs, potential\nprivate sector investors, and service providers. Representatives of other funding agencies\ninvolved  in  microfinance  operations  in  the  respective  countries  and  staff  of  the\nConsultative Group to Assist the Poorest will be invited to the workshops.\n19. The regional workshop will be held in Indonesia for three days. About 40-45 DMC\nrepresentatives will participate. About 25 of these participants will come from the four\ncountries in which country studies will be conducted, while the rest will come from about\nfour other DMCs where ADB is involved in microfinance development operations. About 8\nrepresentatives of other funding agencies will also be invited to participate in this regional\nworkshop. The DMC participants will be identified by AWAR staff in consultation with the\nother concerned departments and offices and the relevant resident missions. The results\nof the country studies and regional study will be disseminated to ADB staff through the\nmicrofinance newsletter and seminars.\n20. The TA will require about 10 person-months of international and 8 person-months\nof domestic consulting services. The consultants will be experts in microfinance and\nselected on an individual basis. The international consultant will carry out the country\nstudies and conduct the country workshops in association with the domestic consultants\nof the respective countries. The international consultant will also prepare the comparative\nstudy  and  conduct  the  regional  workshop.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  for  the  TA\nconsultants are given in Appendix 3. In addition, four domestic resource persons will be\nengaged  to  assist  in  conducting  each  country  workshop.  ADB  will  invite  a  selected\nnumber  of  MFIs  to  prepare  and  present  specific  case  studies  on  their  institutional\nexperience  with  commercialization  at  the  country  workshops.  Two  internationally\nrecognized  microfinance  resource  persons  will  be  invited  to  assist  the  international\nconsultant  in  conducting  the  regional  workshop.  The  selection  and  engagement  of\nconsultants will be carried out by ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of\nConsultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic\nconsultants. The TA is expected to commence in March 2001 and be completed in April\n2002.\nIV.         THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n21.
