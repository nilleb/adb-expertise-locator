INTRODUCTION \n1.  Improved  public  procurement  systems  add  to  increased  trust  and  support  for \ngovernment operations. Technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nthe Asia Pacific Procurement Partnership Initiative has demonstrated the importance of such \nenhancements. 1 \n \n2.  The  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  embarked  upon  implementing  an \ne-procurement system as one of its key policy initiatives in 2012, and requested ADB TA \nsupport. In March 2012, ADB provided support to (i) conceptualize an e-procurement reform \nstrategy, (ii) initiate the stakeholder consultation process, and (iii) provide technical advice on \nimproving the e-procurement portal developed by the government.2 In October 2012, ADB\u2019s \nfact-finding mission reached an understanding with the government on the objectives, scope, \ncost  estimates,  financing,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  TA.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In the Kyrgyz Republic, public procurement accounts for about 6% of gross domestic \nproduct. Public procurement spending for 2011 was SOM16 billion ($340 million),4 of which 33% \nwas spent by budget entities, 17% by local government entities, and the remaining 50% by \nstate-owned enterprises with more than 50% of state share. Public procurement accounted for \nabout 20% of the budget for 2011. Thus, savings resulting from increased efficiency in public \nprocurement operations would be significant. The joint procurement assessment of ADB and the \nWorld  Bank  reported  a  serious  need  for  procurement  reform  to  improve  efficiency  and \ntransparency and specific measures to prevent and detect fraud and corruption.5  \n \n4.  Governments that have implemented e-procurement have reported the following key \nmeasurable benefits: transactional efficiency in tendering, increased competition, and enhanced \nuser satisfaction. In addition to the measurable benefits, e-procurement enhances transparency \nand  reduces  fraud  and  corruption  in  public  procurement.  When  transactions  are  handled \nelectronically  by  all  procuring  entities  using  the  unified  e-procurement  system,  national \nanalytical reports can be generated with minimal effort.  \n \n5.  Suppliers will be able to learn about public procurement opportunities from a single \ncentralized  source  of  information  and  also  transact  (i.e.  submit  their  bids  and  invoices \nelectronically) with multiple procuring entities using the e-procurement system. E-procurement \nwill also enable the creation of a national database of suppliers and the automatic generation of \nsupplier  performance  reports.  Furthermore,  e-procurement  will  build  capacity  among \ngovernment  officials  and  suppliers  in  using  information  and  communication  technology \ninfrastructure for handling procurement transactions. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for the Asia Pacific Procurement Partnership Initiative. Manila (TA 7437-REG, \n$1.3 million).  \n2  The Kyrgyz Resident Mission, supported by the Central Operations Services Office, fielded an international \nconsultant for 3 person-months to assist the government in preparing an e-procurement reform strategy and \nimplementation plan.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 29 October 2012.  \n4  Government of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Ministry  of  Finance.  2012.  Public  Procurement  Report  2011.  Bishkek \n(prepared by the Public Procurement Methodology and Analysis Department).  \n5  The draft report on the country procurement status review prepared by a joint assessment team of ADB and the \nWorld Bank was shared with the government in August 2012. The dissemination workshop was conducted in \nOctober 2012 in Bishkek.  \n ", "2 \n \n6.  The  national  development  strategy  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  emphasizes  governance \nreform,  in  particular  public  sector  reforms  and  anticorruption  measures.  Development  and \nadoption of a nationwide e-procurement system is one of the key public sector management \nreform initiatives of the current government. In September 2012, the government approved the \nPublic  Procurement  Development  Strategy,  2012\u20132014, 6  which  reflects  government \ncommitment to and ownership of the reform.  \n \n7.  Implementation of a unified end-to-end system is included in the procurement strategy, \nwherein all government agencies will use a single software system to handle their procurement \nactivities from planning to payment. The first functionality of the e-procurement system (e-\npublication) has been implemented, using the government\u2019s internal resources and in-house \nexpertise. The TA will build on the reform achievements and provide inputs to overcome the \ndeficiency in goods and services required for implementing the fully functional e-procurement \nsystem. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n8.  The TA will help the government develop and roll out the e-procurement system. The TA \nwill support establishment of a management system, the making of rules, system analysis, \nbuilding hardware and software platforms, building capacity of all stakeholders, phased testing \nand installation, and monitoring during the trial period.   \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be increased efficiency and trust in public sector spending. Transparency \nand  efficiency  gains  created  by  a  unified  e-procurement  platform  will  contribute  to  better \ngovernance in public sector management. The outcome will be improved transparency and \nefficiency of the public procurement system. Successful implementation of e-procurement will \nincrease market confidence in the public procurement system. A 50% increase in the average \nnumber  of  bidders  participating  in  public  procurement  is  expected.  A  30%  reduction  in \nprocurement transaction costs and time taken by the procuring entities, and improved ability to \ngenerate real-time and analytical reports on procurement spending by the central government, \nare the real benefits of the efficiency of the public procurement system. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  have  three  outputs:  (i)  a  phased  development  and  rollout  of  the \ne-procurement system by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) for procuring entities, (ii) enhanced \ntechnical skills of the MOF for development and implementation of the e-procurement system, \nand (iii) improved awareness and capacity of end users of the e-procurement system. \n \n11.  In achieving the outputs and outcome, two key risks are identified. First, the system \ndesign may not be fully effective in ensuring bidder participation across the country, as internet \naccess is not yet comprehensive. Second, there may be delays and lags due to capacity \nproblems  in  software  maintenance  and  management,  and  government  infrastructure  for \ninformation technology (IT). Phased introduction of e-procurement, in-house capacity building \nactivities, and the system sustainability model will mitigate these risks.  \n                                                \n6  ADB assisted the government in developing the procurement strategy based on the recommendations of the \ncountry procurement status review.  \n ", "3 \n12.  Phased implementation. Shifting from manual procurement to e-procurement denotes \na major change that will require significant efforts. Under the TA, the unified end-to-end system \nwill be implemented in phases according to the roll-out plan in the following dimensions:  \n \n(i)  Geography. The use of the e-procurement system will be expanded to new \nprocuring entities.  \n(ii)  Functional components. The use of e-tendering, pre- and post-tendering, and \ne-shopping functionality will be gradually expanded.  \n(iii)  Time.  Expansion  in  using the  e-procurement system  is  planned for  every  6 \nmonths.  \n \n13.  According to the MOF analysis, 85 procuring entities published 1,880 unlimited tenders \nin 2011. In the roll-out plan, procuring entities are prioritized by the number of tenders published, \nand agencies with a higher number of tenders will be the first to use the system. The TA will fill \nthe gap in hardware and internet access of the government end users, especially in oblasts \n(provinces).  \n \n14.  Key functional components of the e-procurement system and estimated dates for their \nreadiness are as follows: (i) e-publication: June 2012 (completed by the government); (ii) e-\ntendering and e-auction: December 2013; (iii) pre- and post-tendering workflows: June 2014; \nand (iv) e-shopping: December 2014. The full-fledged system will be rolled out to all procuring \nentities (more than 75 will use all functional components) within 3 years.  \n \n15.  Government  ownership  and  sustainability.  It  is  assumed  that  the  government \nremains committed to e-procurement implementation. A single e-procurement software system \nwill be used as government shared infrastructure. The TA will (i) augment the government\u2019s \nongoing initiative, where required, to empower the government in implementing the full-fledged \ne-procurement system; and (ii) strengthen government in-house capabilities to maintain the \nsystem.  \n16.  Article  14  of  the  Public  Procurement  Law,  2004  refers  to  an  authority  on  public \nprocurement and defines its main functions. Government resolution confirms the MOF\u2019s role to \nact  as  the  public  procurement  authority  referred  to  in  the  law  and  establishes  the  Public \nProcurement Methodology and Analysis Department (PPMAD) under the MOF with a mandate \nto implement legal and institutional reforms. A dedicated project management unit (PMU) will be \nset up under the PPMAD to develop, introduce, and maintain the e-procurement system.  \n17.   The TA will finance critical inputs required to develop the system and transition users \nfrom manual procurement to e-procurement. The handling of transactions using e-procurement \nwill produce cost savings, which can be used for sustaining the TA outcome. The procurement \nstrategy  envisaged  that  the  government  will  charge  small  fees  for  efficient  handling  of \nprocurement transactions using the e-procurement system. These transaction fees could be \nused to sustain the e-procurement system, thus ensuring long-term viability of the reform. The \ngovernment procedure on the use of e-procurement (to be approved in 2013) should specify the \nmechanism for ensuring the security and service quality of its operation. \n \n18.  Software  development.  Info-System,  a  state-owned  enterprise  under  the  MOF,  is \nengaged to develop the preliminary e-procurement software. The government will commission \nInfo-System to set up a dedicated software development unit (SDU) to develop the full-fledged \nend-to-end e-procurement software. The TA will finance additional open-source software and \n ", "4 \nserver  infrastructure  including  rack  servers  and  virtualization  software  within  the  TA  funds \nbudgeted for equipment. \n \n19.  Establishment of digital signature center. The TA will support the creation of a digital \nsignature center7 specifically to address digital signature requirements in the e-procurement \nsystem. Digital signatures will be enabled in the e-procurement software platform and used by \ngovernment users and contractors to authenticate, verify integrity, and enable non-repudiation \nof electronic transactions. In addition, USB tokens will be used to store and access digital \nsignature certificates from special hardware for 5 years. The digital signature center will be \ndesigned to handle the issuance of certificates for up to 10,000 users.8    \n \n20.  Call center software solution. By launching the e-procurement system, Info-System \nintends to expand the capacity of the call center and help desk system it established in 2010. \nThe  TA  will  finance  additional  software  and  hardware  modules,  licenses,  IP-phones,  and \nconnection to a digital data stream to enable the call center system to serve all users of the e-\nprocurement system. A dedicated telephonic help desk supplemented by the call center will \nguide  suppliers  and  government  officials  using  the  e-procurement  system  and  receive \ngrievances about e-procurement and public procurement in general.     \n \n21.  Capacity building and change management. Capacity development activities for the \nPMU and SDU teams will include a study tour and two specialized training programs abroad.9 \nSystematic and dedicated training programs will be created in cooperation with the training \ncenter of the MOF to upgrade the skills of procurement specialists in using the e-procurement \nsystem and in overall public procurement. Hands-on e-procurement software training will be \nprovided. Training programs and public awareness campaigns will be conducted specifically to \neducate suppliers about e-procurement and public procurement initiatives. \n22.  The TA will support IT infrastructure and internet connectivity of government offices on a \ngap-filling basis to enable end use of the e-procurement system. The PPMAD should complete \na needs assessment and IT penetration survey in oblasts by January 2013. The survey will \nupdate the plan to roll out the e-procurement system and establish support centers in oblasts.    \n \n23.  Under the TA, government end users will receive support in using the e-procurement \nsystem. Suppliers will also receive support from e-procurement support centers to ensure a \nsmooth transition from manual procurement to e-procurement.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n24.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,300,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space for consultants, and other in-\nkind contributions. \n                                                \n7  Info-System has obtained prior approval from the State Committee on National Security on the scheme for creating \na digital signature center. A government decree will be issued accordingly in line with its creation. Info-System will \noperate the digital signature center.  \n8  The government will create suitable legal provisions such that certificates issued by the digital signature center and \ndocuments signed using such certificates with the root certificate of the digital signature center will be deemed \nlegally valid. The TA will finance hardware equipment and USB tokens to support the establishment of the digital \nsignature center. \n9 The location for the study tour and suitable international training programs will be identified during the TA \nimplementation.  \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n25.  The MOF will be the executing agency and will lead the TA implementation. It will \nestablish a dedicated PMU and SDU to implement the TA with full ownership and smooth \nintegration with pre- and post-TA activities. A working group with representatives from procuring \nentities, supplier communities, and civil society organizations constituted by the government will \nprovide guidance to the MOF in implementing the e-procurement system. Office space, furniture, \ncounterpart  staff  salaries,  and  other  support  costs  required  for  project  management  and \nsoftware development teams will be provided by the government.  \n \n26.   The following individual national consultants will be hired for a total of 468 person-\nmonths:  technical  and  operations  director  (30  person-months),  two  business  analysts  (30 \nperson-months each), trainer (30 person-months), six field assistants (21 person-months each), \naccounts and administration specialist (30 person-months), module lead and senior developer \n(30  person-months),  three  developers  (24  person-months  each),  testing  lead  (30 person-\nmonths),  document  writer  (30  person-months),  and  application  and  operating  system \nadministrator (30 person-months). An individual international consultant (6 person-months) will \nbe hired on an intermittent basis for 3 years to review and monitor the TA status and to provide \ntechnical advice on the implementation of e-procurement. Terms of reference for the individual \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. An international firm for third-party software audit will be hired \nthrough the consultants\u2019 qualifications selection method.10 Consultants will be hired by ADB in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). \nIT system infrastructure equipment and hardware will be procured through the Shopping method \naccording  to  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nequipment procured will be used for the implementation of the e-procurement system and will \nbe handed over to the executing agency upon TA completion. Disbursements under the TA will \nbe made according to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  36  months,  from  January  2013  to \nDecember 2015. \n \n27.    TA progress will be assessed according to the performance targets and indicators in the \ndesign and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). A baseline study will be conducted at the outset \nto benchmark performance in the manual procurement system, and the same study will be \nrepeated after implementation to evaluate the impact of the e-procurement system. \n \n28.  Lessons  from  implementing  the  TA  will  be  documented  during  the  midterm  and \ncompletion reviews, disclosed on ADB\u2019s website, and presented in regional workshops and \nprocurement forums organized among ADB developing member countries.  \n  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n29.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government  of the  Kyrgyz  Republic for Implementing  the  e-Procurement  System,  and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n10  Security audit of software is a specialized activity, typically done by the information systems practice of large \nmultinational firms. Given the specialized nature of this engagement, and considering that the cost allocated for the \nsame is $74,500, adoption of the consultants\u2019 qualifications selection  method is proposed. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines a  Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nEfficiency and trust  Public perception on trust  MOF\u2019s baseline study of  The government \nin public sector  (i.e. less corruption) in  manual system in 2012,  remains committed to \nspending increased  government procurement  and survey report on  e-procurement \nimproved by 50% by end of  e-procurement system  implementation in public \n2017a   in 2018  sector management  \n \n20% increase in government  E-procurement system-\nprojects implemented  generated reports on \naccording to the approved  bids and results issued \nannual budget and  by the MOF on quarterly \nprocurement plan by end of  basis \n2017a \nOutcome      Assumption \nTransparency and  50% increase in average  MOF\u2019s baseline study of  One e-procurement \nefficiency of the  number of bidders by end of  manual system in 2012,  software system will be \npublic procurement  2015a  and survey report on  used as shared \nsystem improved  e-procurement system  infrastructure by all \nin early 2016  government agencies  \n \n   \n  30% reduction in the time  Report by TA PMU,  Risk \ntaken for average  MOF\u2019s survey report  The system design may \n \nprocurement transaction by  about e-procurement  not be fully effective in \nend of 2015a  system among  ensuring participation of \nstakeholders in early  bidders across the \n2016  country, as internet \ncoverage is not 100% \nOutputs      Risk \n1.
