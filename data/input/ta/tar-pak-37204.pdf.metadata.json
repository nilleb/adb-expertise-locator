The  2004  Pakistan  country  strategy  and  program  update  (CSPU)  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  reaffirms  the  strategy  of  supporting  good  governance,  pro-poor \neconomic growth, and inclusive social development, with a major focus on good governance. \nThe CSPU commits ADB to deepening ongoing assistance in support of governance reforms by \n(i) \u201cdecentralizing\u201d assistance to the province level; (ii) ensuring that design of ADB projects is \nconsistent with the new governance structures and procedures created under laws concerned \nwith devolution and related reforms; and (iii) supporting the Government\u2019s efforts to ensure \nbetter coordination of external funding agencies at the operational level, particularly including \nprovincial  and  local  governments.  This  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  assist  the \nGovernment and ADB to meet these commitments.  \n \n2.  The volume of ADB lending impacted by devolution places unprecedented demands on \nthe  Government,  ADB  mission  leaders,  and  Pakistan  Resident  Mission  (PRM).  The  TA  is \ndesigned to help the Government align and coordinate its operations, including those financed \nby external funding agencies, with policy on devolution, gender, and social development. The \nobjective, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and \nterms of reference of the TA2 were designed during dialogue with the Government and donor \npartners  for  the  CSPU  (March-May  2003)  and  subsequently  refined  during  preparation  of \nlending operations (January-May 2004). The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Devolution Reform and Poverty Reduction. The federal Government published the \npoverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP)3 in December 2003, and provincial governments have \npublished  draft  PRSPs.  Devolution  is  central  to  the  federal  and  all  provincial  PRSPs. \nResponsibility for delivery of the bulk of social and productive services and for regulation of civil \nsociety,  natural  resources,  labor,  and  commercial  activity  has  been  devolved  to  local \ngovernments.  New laws in support of devolution also provide an unprecedented opportunity for \nimproving relations between governments and organized elements of civil society in all aspects \nof  service  delivery,  justice,  and  social  regulation  at  the  local  level.  Major  reorientation  of \nprovincial governments is also required now to ensure their effective policy, fiscal, technical, and \nregulatory support for service delivery. The challenge for donors is to ensure that support for the \nPRSP  is  delivered  in  a  manner  consistent  with  the  new  local  institutional  arrangements, \nsystems, and procedures created under the local government ordinances (LGOs) 2001, the \nPolice Order 2002, and associated legislation governing justice, civil society, gender, and social \ndevelopment. In the past, the Government relied on donor assistance for approximately 60% of \nits development spending. Failure to quickly realign donor assistance modalities could both \ndelay  and  disrupt  the  capacity  building  necessary  for  provincial  and  local  governments  to \nassume the new responsibilities and accountabilities envisaged under devolution. In turn, this \nrisks public dissatisfaction with the progress of devolution and could undermine implementation \nof the poverty reduction strategy.  \n \n4.  Implications of ADB\u2019s Devolution Focus and Provincial Strategy. PRM\u2019s assistance \nto the poverty reduction strategy has placed ADB in a leading role in the donor community\u2019s \nsupport for poverty reduction through governance reforms. During 2001 and 2002, the ADB \n                                                 \n2  The TA is in the 2004 Country Program and first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 \nFebruary 2004.  \n3  The national PRSP is available at http://www.finance.gov.pk/poverty/prsp_03.pdf ", "2    \nBoard of Directors approved two major program loans to governance reforms in Pakistan, both \nof which are classified as core poverty interventions: the Access to Justice Program4 (AJP) and \nthe Decentralization Support Program5 (DSP). Through these programs, ADB is also engaged in \na  range  of  new  initiatives  with  civil  society,  especially  Pakistan\u2019s  nongovernmental \norganizations, to build a broad-based constituency for these reforms and to help them capitalize \non new opportunities for relations between states civil society provided for in the LGOs and PO, \nas well as associated legislation governing consumer rights, freedom of information, defamation \nand contempt, pro-poor law reform, management of environmental assets, and promotion of \nhuman rights.  \n \n5.  Recently, ADB and the Government agreed to prepare and implement province-focused \npublic sector reform programs as part of a wider strategy to establish policy dialogue and \npartnerships at the provincial level and to consolidate support to devolution: the ongoing Punjab \nPublic Resource Management Program6 and the proposed Balochistan resource management \nprogram.7  These  programs  will  also  impact  directly  on  ADB\u2019s  assistance8  to  the  health, \neducation, water and sanitation, and rural development sectors by helping define the planning, \nfiscal, and regulatory arrangements through which the province will communicate its policy \npriorities to local governments. ADB will also assist the four provincial devolved social services \nprograms  (DSSP)  (Sindh  2003,  Punjab  2004,  Balochistan  2005,  and  North-West  Frontier \nProvince  2006)  that  aim  to  strengthen  provincial  and  local  government  commitments  to \nimproved social service delivery. As a result of the CSPU refinement of ADB\u2019s strategy, the \nshare of governance programs in the total lending program has increased from 9% in the \ncountry strategy and program to 23% in the CSPU, and 45\u201355% of all lending will be affected by \nthe commitment to design all future ADB projects in a manner consistent with devolution and to \nbuild effective province-focused support.  \n \n6.  The Government has recently announced a donor coordination strategy. The TA will (i) \nhelp the planning and coordination agencies of federal and provincial governments develop  \ninnovative strategies and operations to implement investment projects; (ii) provide technical and \ncapacity-building  support  to  provincial  and  local  governments,  whose  skillful  adoption  and \nimplementation of the new devolved systems will be crucial to the success of the larger poverty \nreduction strategy; and (iii) help the Government refine the donor coordination strategy and \nrealign the ongoing external assistance to the imperatives of devolution. The TA\u2019s stakeholders \nwill include private-sector service providers, civil society, community-based organizations, and \n                                                 \n4   ADB. 2001.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Outputs \n7.  The objective of the TA is to help integrate donor-supported poverty reduction and \ngovernance reform initiatives at the program and project levels. The TA will have three primary \noutputs:  (i) better coordination and alignment at the provincial levels for new and existing \nprojects  in  key  PRSP  sectors  (e.g.,  health,  education,  water  and  sanitation,  and  rural \ndevelopment):  (ii)  greater  consistency  between  devolution  policy  and  procedures  and  the \ninstitutional  and  financial  design  features  of  ADB  ongoing  and  pipeline  TA  and  lending \noperations: and (iii) manuals, guides, and training events for sector managers and policymakers \nin the Government.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.   The TA will augment the capacity of the federal Planning Commission (PC) and the \nprovincial planning and development departments (P&D) to coordinate and monitor the effective \nuse of external development assistance supporting the devolution plan. The TA will supplement \nprovincial program support offices (PPSO) created under the DSP to provide technical advice to \nthe P&Ds and line departments supporting local government delivery of devolved services. This \nassociation between the TA and DSP will ensure direct linkage between the systems and \nprocedures for devolution developed under the DSP and key sector operations that are the \nfocus of the TA. The TA will engage expertise to  (i) manage programs in support of poverty \nreduction and devolution reforms in the provinces, including design of intergovernmental fiscal \nand other institutional arrangements; (ii) review and contribute to the design of sector-wide \nreform  strategies  (in  particular,  for  health,  education,  water  and  sanitation,  and  rural \ndevelopment)  consistent  with  devolution;  and  (iii)  establish  databases  and  coordinative \narrangements to help provincial governments realign vertical programs to devolution policy and \nprocedures.   \n \n9.  Domestic consultants in long-term provincial positions and short-term resource persons \nwith considerable experience in key sectors will be engaged to provide technical support to \nfederal  and  provincial  governments,  as  required,  in  aligning  development  operations  to \ndevolution. In particular, the TA will help build operational liaison between the DSP, DSSPs, and \nother ADB programs in support of public resource management and devolved service delivery.9 \nA technical support pool will allow the Government to respond to particular issues requiring \nintensive  coordination  and  problem  solving,  as  well  as  provide  training  and  capacity \ndevelopment support.  \n  \n1.  Component 1: Poverty and Governance Reform Program Management \n \n10.  A key responsibility of the P&Ds is to support intergovernmental linkages and overall \ncoherence in administering development assistance to provincial and local governments. The \nkey areas for support at the provincial level are (i) poverty reduction, devolution, and local \ngovernment  reforms;  (ii)  intergovernmental  fiscal  restructuring,  revenue  management,  and \nexpenditure planning; (iii) physical asset management; (iv) technical assistance management, \n                                                 \n9 The operational details will be worked out during the inception mission. \n ", "4    \nfocusing on capacity development; and (v) gender mainstreaming through devolution reforms. \nTo enhance the P&Ds\u2019 capacity, the TA will engage long-term domestic consultants in each \nprovince to provide expertise in these five areas to government officials responsible for ADB\u2019s \nongoing and pipeline TA and lending operations from 2004 to 2006. Their ongoing operations \nwill be coordinated by the program director, PPSO of the DSP.  \n \n2.  Component 2: Sector-wide Reform Strategies and Operations \n \n11.  Existing arrangements for planning, budgeting, and financing service delivery need to be \nreoriented from a vertical program approach (wherein delivery arrangements are controlled by \nfederal and provincial agencies) to one governed through intergovernmental fiscal transfer rules \nand  procedures  in  support  of  local  government  service  delivery.10  While  the  LGOs  define \nresponsibilities of local governments and mandate province finance commissions (PFCs) to \ndesign  and  monitor  these  new  intergovernmental  fiscal  arrangements,  the  LGOs  do  not \nexplicitly stipulate the new corresponding roles of provincial governments. Although provinces \nno longer have the power to command and control the delivery performance of local authorities, \nit is not clear how to reform existing sector policy, planning, and financing arrangements in a \nway that is consistent with devolution and allows provinces to effectively communicate their \npolicy priorities. However, provincial departments are beginning to introduce sector-wide policy11 \nand donor coordination approaches that need further encouragement and linkage with PRSP \ncommitments and medium-term budget frameworks.  \n \n12.  Short-term  inputs  will  be  provided  by  various  resource  persons  under  a  technical \nresource pool to (i) help the Government review existing provincial institutional arrangements for \nplanning, financing, and delivering social services; (ii) help PFCs design modalities for fund flow \nmanagement, thereby aiding the transition from a vertical program to an intergovernmental \ngrant system approach; and (iii) provide basic orientation to enable government officials to \nincorporate the changed approaches in design and implementation.  \n \n3.  Component 3: Operational and Design Support  \n13.  This component will provide government official\u2019s direct support to address the CSPU \ncommitment  to  design  pipeline  lending  and  to  revisit  recently  approved  lending  to  ensure \nconsistency with devolution policy, laws, and procedures. This component will help the PC and \nprovincial P&Ds maintain accurate databases of donor activities to support policy dialogue and \ndesign of province-wide donor coordination strategy for sector-wide and specific large-scale \nmultidonor programs. Such institutional realignment also requires civil-society engagement to \nensure sustained policy dialogue and build ownership for ongoing reforms. Of particular note \nare two imperatives: (i) strengthening coordination between the federal and provincial planning \nagencies and civil society; and (ii) facilitating tripartite linkages between the Government, ADB, \nand civil society. At the provincial level, these imperatives will be addressed through civil-society \ncoordinators who will organize, facilitate, and document project-specific consultations. The TA \nwill assist provincial P&Ds by engaging short-term civil-society coordinators in the provinces to \nfacilitate ADB-Government-civil-society cooperation and policy exchange and help refine ADB\u2019s \nongoing and pipeline operations from 2004 to 2006. \n \n                                                 \n10  This  need  was  identified  as  urgent  priority  in  the  Devolution  in  Pakistan  report  series.  Available  at \nwww.adb.org/prm.   \n11 ADB-assisted Gender Reform Action Plans include proposals on formulation of gender and development strategies \nfor key sectors.  The component will support this process. ", "    5\n14.  Precise details of the priority activities to be supported in each province will be defined \nthrough periodic consultation with the PC and P&Ds, in the context of the ongoing DSP and \nDSSP  quarterly  work-planning  process  and  annual  performance  reviews  (APRs).  This  will \nensure that consultant inputs are closely linked with actual priorities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $560,000 equivalent, comprising all local currency. ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program will finance $450,000 of this on a grant basis, and the Government will \ncontribute the remaining local currency of $110,000 equivalent to provide office accommodation, \ncounterpart staff, facilities for seminars and meetings, and administrative support. Appendix 2 \nsummarizes the cost estimates.                                                                                                                               \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n16.  The PC will be the Executing Agency for the TA and the provincial P&Ds will be the \nimplementing agencies. The PC has nominated as TA project director a senior official who \nrepresents the PC on the DSP national program steering committee (NPSC). An inception \nmission and quarterly meetings of the PC, consultants engaged under the TA, the chair of the \nNPSC, and ADB, chaired by the PC, will review TA implementation progress. The quality of \noutputs from the TA consultants will be evaluated through the standard consultant annual \npersonnel performance review and the APR process. \n \n17.  The TA is scheduled to be implemented over 18 months, from December 2004 to June \n2006. A team of domestic consultants will provide a total of 80 person-months of consulting \nservices. The consultants will be engaged by ADB on an individual basis in accordance with its \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. The team \nwill  be  managed  by  the  team  leader  of  TA  4207\u2013PAK:  Support  to  Implementation  of \nDecentralization II (SID II) who will be responsible for the quality of consultants\u2019 performance. \nModifications to the scope, terms, and activities of consultants recruited under this TA will be \ndecided jointly by the team leader of TA 4207-PAK and the TA project director. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.       The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Pakistan for Strengthening Coordination and Alignment of Government \nOperations to Devolution, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n ", "6 Appendix 1   \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n       \n Design Summary  Performance  Monitoring Mechanisms Assumptions and Risks \nIndicators/Targets   \n \nGoal       \nImproved efficiency in donor-\nassisted investments in poverty \nreduction strategy priorities and \noutcomes \nPurpose:      Risk \nStrengthen integration of poverty  Provincial planning and  National Program Steering Resources are not provided in a \nreduction and devolved governance  development departments Committees (NPSC) and  sufficient, timely, or predictable \nreform approaches at the program  (P&Ds) provide quality  ADB records  fashion. \nand project levels   information and technical \nadvice to the provincial \nand national steering \ncommittees and ADB \nOutput 1      Risks \nDesign of alternative subnational  Annual work plans,   NPSC minutes  The Government fails to provide \nmodalities for delivery of technical  budgets, and reports  qualified staff and incentives. \nassistance (TA) and lending in key  approved by NPSC  Aid partners refuse  \npoverty reduction strategy paper    Government's requests for \nsectors (e.g., health, education,  Annual performance   NPSC minutes  coordinated support. \nwater and sanitation, rural  review (APR) conducted   \ndevelopment)   Independent audit reports are \nAnnual external audit   NPSC minutes  delayed. \nconducted   \nProvince finance           PFC annual reports  Provincial governments invest \ncommission (PFC)  insufficiently in PFC capacity. \ndesigned grants systems\nActivities       \nTA to assist and develop PC and \nP&D capacity to \n(i)  analyze existing modalities for \ndesign, funding, and \nimplementation of service \ndelivery at subnational level, \nincluding federal and province \nvertical programs;

The Government of Pakistan is mobilizing and directing an unprecedented array of \ntechnical, institutional, and fiscal resources in support of devolution in the context of its poverty \nreduction strategy paper (PRSP). Direct support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nthis process is through the Decentralization Support Program (DSP) and Access to Justice \nProgram (AJP) at federal level, and public-sector resource-management programs in the Punjab \nand Balochistan. ADB is committed to ensuring that all future TA and lending operations will \nsupport and be consistent with devolution. ADB has agreed to revisit recently approved lending \nprojects to determine whether redesign of these projects is warranted. \n \n2.
