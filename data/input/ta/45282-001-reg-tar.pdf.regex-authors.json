INTRODUCTION \n1.  The technical assistance (TA), which is anchored on the core components of Strategy \n2020,1 responds to the inherent demands of developing member countries (DMCs) for greater \napplication of knowledge in Asian Development Bank (ADB) operations and for enhancement of \ntheir  own  knowledge  of  relevant  ADB  guidelines,  rules,  and  regulations.  Continuous \nengagement with DMC governments in the region has shown the need for robust knowledge \nmanagement in development operations. The TA thus stems from the need for ADB to better \nengage  with  DMCs  in  generating  and  sharing  knowledge  that  will  help  enhance  the \neffectiveness of development operations. \n \n2.  The governments of the South Asian DMCs concur with the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementation  arrangements,  costs,  financing  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The key issue for knowledge-driven development emanates from the core precept of use \nof  knowledge  solutions3 to  better  design  and  implement  policy  reforms  and  development \nprograms and projects. In this context, DMCs need knowledge from ADB that is evidence-based \nand that guides them on what works and what does not. They need critical analyses of risks that \nthey face, and how others may or may not have adequately addressed them.  \n \n4.  DMC officials in core ministries (such as finance, treasury, planning) and in sector line \nministers  (such  as  health,  education,  local  development)  are  not  always  aware  of\u2014and \nengaged in\u2014the intellectual debate on development thinking, shifts in development paradigms, \nplanning methodologies, cross-jurisdictional good practice in public management, and current \neconomic trends and political economy considerations. While these issues have often been an \nafterthought, jurisdictions that have had significant learning experiences in development have \ngenerally made investments in incorporating knowledge in development efforts (for instance, \nNew Zealand and Singapore). \n \n5.  What is important is that ADB involvement in DMC development efforts also mandates \nthat it too enhance knowledge solutions in this work.4 The value-addition that ADB provides to \nDMCs is not just in making financial resources available but also in offering advice on technical \nissues and policy reforms (the so-called \u201cfinance ++\u201d concept). This implies that ADB staff must \n                                                 \n \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. Available: www.adb.org/strategy2020/ \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 August 2011. \n3  For purposes of this TA, the term is taken to mean inputs to solving development problems that make use of \ninformation from guides, tools, methods, approaches, and practical experience. At the core of this term is the \nconcept of use of information and knowledge that is practical. \n4 This is particularly true for SARD whose DMCs are diverse in size and characteristics, as implied by (i) their \nborrowing status (India\u2013ordinary capital resources (OCR) only; Bangladesh and Sri Lanka\u2013blend OCR and Asian \nDevelopment Fund (ADF); Nepal\u2013ADF loans and grants, and Bhutan and the Maldives\u2013ADF loans); (ii) area and \npopulation  (from  India  with  almost  1.2  billion  people  to  the  Maldives  with  just  314,000);  (iii)  degree  of \nimplementation capacity in bureaucracy (from rather high in Bhutan to very low in Nepal); and (iv) variance in \ndegree of portfolio performance. Hence, a one-size-fits-all approach is not likely to succeed here, and country-\nspecific knowledge, and application of such knowledge, is paramount in operations work in DMCs of the South \nAsia Department. \n \n ", "2  \nbe  knowledgeable  on issues  that impact  DMC  development  efforts.  ADB\u2019s  recent  drive  to \nenhance staff skills so that development of DMCs is fostered is a good reflection of this. \n \n6.  Internal reviews of project success and analysis of why some development efforts have \nnot had positive results show two key relevant factors: (i) lack of capacity of DMC officials and \nproject staff; and (ii) poor quality at entry, including lack of proper initial assessment of the \nsituation on the ground and prior lessons, inadequate technical analysis, and lack of more \ndetailed sector analysis work in program or project design. Both have deep implications for \nknowledge management. With proper dissemination of knowledge (e.g., of ADB procedures and \nrequirements), DMC officials and project staff would be more skilled and knowledgeable to \nbetter manage programs and projects. With better and more complete knowledge, quality at \nentry  in  program  and  project  development  would  be  that  much  more  rigorous  (e.g.,  due \ndiligence would be more realistic and complete). With better programs, based on accurate \ninformation and analysis (including of risks), coupled with more capable staff, the probability of \nsuccessful program outcomes that contribute to poverty reduction will increase\u2014the vision of \nADB for the region. \n \n7.  Thus,  knowledge  management  work  is  critical,  and  the  application  of  knowledge \nsolutions to the development and policy planning work of DMCs will ensure that they are able to \nattain their development objectives effectively.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the TA will be evident in more relevant and sustainable development \nefforts in the DMCs of South Asia.5 The outcome is better informed development policies and \nstrategies in these DMCs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will capitalize on DMC demand for specific knowledge products and services, \nsupport operations-based knowledge creation in the DMCs of South Asia, and utilize research \nwork carried out in the design of programs and projects. The TA also involves the wide sharing \nof knowledge among the DMCs and ADB staff. Outputs expected from the TA and relevant \nactivities, include the following: \n \n(i)  Knowledge  products.  These  will  provide  in-depth,  relevant,  and  timely \nassessments, policy proposals, and recommendations so that the DMCs can \naddress immediate and long-term development issues. In particular, this includes \nworking papers; research reports on subjects of topical interest; proceedings of \nconferences,  symposiums,  forums,  and  workshops;  program  and  policy \nevaluation compendiums; and others, including risk assessments, books, policy \ntoolkits, blogs, seminar presentations, research alerts, and newsletters. \n \n                                                 \n \n5  The concepts of \u201crelevance\u201d and \u201csustainable\u201d are drawn from the analytical framework used by, among others, the \nIndependent Evaluation Department. Cases where ADB interventions are assessed as relevant and sustainable \nalways include strong evidence of rigorous due diligence and great awareness of the development situation. Both \nof these are intrinsically tied to the application of knowledge management in ADB  work. Appendix 1 and  \nAppendix 4 detail the project design and problem analysis work. \n ", "  3\n(ii)  Knowledge events. Within ADB and the DMCs of South Asia, these events will \nhelp  generate,  share,  and  apply  knowledge.  They  include  (a)  economists\u2019 \nconference with participation of DMC officials; (b) eminent speakers\u2019 forum on \nissues faced by DMCs in South Asia, including on public policy and political \neconomy; (c) policy workshops with DMC officials; and (d) others, such as site \nvisits with, and study visits for, relevant DMC officials. \n \n(iii)  Active  regional  knowledge  partnerships  and  networks.  These  are  to \ngenerate and disseminate knowledge to the DMCs and help share knowledge \nwith them. While partnerships in South Asia have been developed6 (and these \nwill be sustained), more value-addition needs to be generated to expand these to \na premier institute (or institutes) in Asia and the Pacific. This partnership can help \nelevate  discussions  and  debate  on  economic  and  financial  trends  and \ndevelopment paradigms as well as link up with institutions across regions to \nbegin a wider partnership on knowledge sharing. \n \n(iv)  Project implementation on time and within budget. This is related to project \nmanagement and is generated for every project. \n \n10.  The TA has no risks related to social and environmental concerns, public financial \nmanagement, procurement, or corruption. Risks related to the project are detailed in the design \nand  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1).  The  TA  makes  certain  assumptions  about  the \noperating environment for knowledge management in the DMCs. Four that are relevant to the \nTA work at hand include (i) no extraneous adverse conditions impact development efforts (this \nis  an  important  assumption  since  well-designed  development  programs  and  projects  are \nexpected to yield positive impacts); (ii) rigorous due diligence exercises are not prohibitive by \nway of cost and time; (iii) DMC demand for knowledge products and events from ADB continues; \nand (iv) project staff members in the DMCs have opportunities to participate in knowledge \nevents so that they can be more aware of, and knowledgeable about, ADB procedures. \n \n11.  The TA has four risks: (i) political considerations may undermine effectiveness of some \ndevelopment efforts, and thus take away from the rigor of the program and project; (ii) DMC \ngovernments may refuse to internalize risk assessment work, which is not an insignificant issue \nsince risk assessments, by their very nature, highlight some difficult choices to be made by \ngovernments; (iii) reports and assessments available for DMC review may not be deemed \nrelevant when completed, i.e., knowledge management work could tend to be merely an ivory \ntower exercise; and (iv) regional knowledge networks may have different research interests or \ncapacity mismatches during the TA period, a risk that would emerge if sufficient due diligence is \nnot carried out prior to contracting the relevant knowledge partner(s). \n \n12.  The primary risk mitigation measure will be continuous engagement with governments \n(including through resident missions as needed) to address the political considerations risk and \nthat of lack of internalization of risk assessment work. Other risk mitigation measures will \ninclude: (i) engaging with DMCs early on in the programming cycle (such as during the country \npartnership  and  strategy  exercise);  (ii)  constantly  monitoring  the  quality  of  the  knowledge \nproducts  and  events;  and  (iii)  ensuring  that  the  DMCs  are  involved  in  their  design  and \nimplementation, which will minimize the risk of knowledge work being considered an ivory tower \n                                                 \n \n6  For example, the South Asia Center for Policy Studies and South Asia Network of Economic Research Institutes. \n ", "4  \nexercise. Engagement could be in the form of involvement in missions related to portfolio review, \ncountry programming review, and country partnership and strategy design exercises.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.5 million equivalent. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF); $500,000 from TASF-IV \nand $1,000,000 from TASF-others (Appendix 2). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  Executing and implementing agencies. ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. \nThe  South  Asia  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations  Coordination  Division  (SARC),  the \nimplementing agency, will coordinate closely with the DMCs of South Asia participating resident \nmissions and sector divisions, and other departments in ADB (such as the Economic Research \nDepartment, Office of Regional Economic Integration, Strategy and Policy Department, and \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department). \n \n15.  Project steering committee. A project steering committee (PSC) will be established to \nbe chaired by the SARC director and comprising members who are knowledge focal points in \nthe sector divisions and resident missions (these focal points have already been designated). \nThe committee will meet every 4 months, at which time representatives from the non-SARD \ndepartments may be invited to join, as deemed necessary. Day-to-day TA operations will be \nunder  the  guidance  of  SARC\u2019s  principal  knowledge  management  specialist  with  active \ninvolvement of a knowledge management coordinator (individual national consultant). \n \n16.  Project duration. The project will run from December 2011 to December 2014. \n \n17.  Consultancy inputs. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Details on the consultants and \ntheir terms of reference are available in Table 1 and Appendix 3. No procurement of any goods \nis envisaged. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n18.  Complementary inputs. Other ADB inputs to the TA include (i) research publications, \nreports, software, and database(s) necessary to undertake research activities; (ii) office space \nand facilities, as may be required to carry out the research; (iii) conference and forum venues \nfor all knowledge activities organized at headquarters and in the resident missions; and (iv) peer \nreview provisions for research work to be carried out as part of the TA. Complementary inputs \nfrom  DMC  governments  will  include  venues,  as  needed,  for  seminars  and  symposiums \norganized by DMC governments; counterpart staff to be involved in knowledge management \nwork; and local transport for DMC officials involved in TA-related research and analyses. \n \n19.  Project  monitoring,  peer  review,  and  reporting. The PSC will monitor and guide \nproject  implementation  progress.  The  quarterly  PSC  meeting  will  monitor  project  progress \nbased  on  the  agreed  pipeline  of  outputs  identified  during  consultations  with  government \nagencies, research organizations, and development institutions. Peer review within ADB and by \nother research and academic institutions will be used as a tool to evaluate the quality and depth \nof  analysis  of  working  papers,  policy  briefs,  and  other  studies.  A  progress  report  will  be \nprepared for discussion at each PSC meeting (i.e., every 4 months). A TA completion report will \nevaluate TA achievements against the targeted outputs.  \n ", "  5\n \nTable 1.

SARC will closely monitor deadlines set for all publications work, including timely printing \nand delivery. For the knowledge products, the Economic Research Department, Regional and \nSustainable Development Department, and Office of Regional Economic Integration, among \nothers within ADB, will play a key role in monitoring quality and providing peer review, as \nneeded, to enhance quality. \n \n21.  Good practices and lessons from the TA will be disseminated through (i) several policy \nforums,  workshops,  and  seminars  to  share  the  results  of  relevant  knowledge  generation \nactivities; (ii) policy briefs and other documents provided to DMC governments and others to \nconsider for incorporation when formulating development policies; (iii) websites of ADB and \nDMC governments; and (iv) publication in relevant practitioner and academic-based knowledge \nsources, such as peer-reviewed journals. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis \nfor Strengthening Knowledge-Driven Development in South Asia, and hereby reports this action \nto the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets and  Data Sources and  Assumptions and Risks\nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselinesa  Reporting Mechanisms    \nImpact  (Both targets by 3 years after     \nMore relevant and  project completion)    Assumption \nsustainable development      No extraneous adverse \nefforts in the DMCs of  At least 80% of completed ADB  Program Completion  conditions impacting \nSouth Asia  programs and projects in South Asia  Reports and validation  development efforts \nDMCs rated successfulb (2010  ratings   \nbaseline: 72%)  IED evaluations  Risk \nMaintain 100% of all completed     Political considerations may \nCPSs in South Asia DMCs rated    undermine some \nsuccessful (2010 baseline: 100%)  development efforts \nOutcome  (All targets by December 2014)     \nBetter informed      Assumption \ndevelopment policies  All programs, projects, and strategies  SARD end-of-project  Rigorous due diligence \nand strategies in DMCs   for South Asia DMCs have rigorous  survey of RRPs and  exercises are not prohibitive \n  risk assessments carried out in  whatever strategies that  by way of cost and time \n  conjunction with government (2011  include risk assessments   \n  baseline: 33% [estimate])    Risk \nAt least 80% of operational staff  SARD annual reports  DMCs refuse to internalize \n(males/females) of programs and    risk assessment work \nprojects for South Asia DMCs have     \nbeen trained on ADB guidelines,   \nprocedures, and assessment   \nmethods (2011 baseline: 60%   \n[estimate])  SARD annual reports \nAt least 75% of all projects for South   \nAsia DMCs include knowledge \nsharing (e.g., seminars, publications) \n(2011 baseline: less than one-third \n[estimate]) \nOutputs   (All targets by December 2014)     \n1.
