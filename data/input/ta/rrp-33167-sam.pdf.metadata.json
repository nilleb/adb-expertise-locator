The  Project  will  (i)\nsupport  the  expansion  of  the  small  business  loans\nguarantee  scheme  (SBLGS)  utilizing  the  existing\nmanagement  framework  that  exists  through  the  Small\nBusiness Enterprise Centre (SBEC); (ii) support a pilot\nmicrofinance  facility  onlent  through  the  Development\nBank  of  Samoa  (DBS)  to  approved  participating\norganizations;  (iii)  establish  a  Small  Business\nDevelopment  Fund  (SBDF)  to  purchase  additional\nbusiness advisory and training services from approved\nbusiness development service (BDS) providers; and (iv)\nsupport the Government\u2019s ongoing efforts to improve the\nlegal and regulatory environment for the corporate sector\ngenerally,  in  particular  in  those  areas  that  impact  the\nMSE sector. In addition, as part of the Project, the Asian\nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  will  consider  making  an\ninvestment in a venture capital facility targeting MSE.\nClassification Economic Growth\nEnvironmental Assessment Category C. Environmental implications were reviewed,\nand no significant adverse environmental impacts were\nidentified.\nRationale Over 80 percent of all businesses in Samoa have five or\nfewer employees. Most of these enterprises do not have\nadequate skill levels to create, manage, and increase the\nsize of their enterprises. These enterprises lack equity\nand access to bank borrowings to provide a sustainable\nfinancing basis for their development. With at least 80\npercent of land under customary communal ownership,\nwhich cannot be alienated either by sale or mortgage,\nmost  business  enterprises  have  limited  choices  of\nacceptable  securities  that  they  can  offer  to  access\nfinancial  services.  The  limited  freehold  land  that  is\navailable for securing borrowings from commercial banks\nis concentrated around the Apia urban area. Therefore\nthe  problem  of  access  to  financial  services  is\ncompounded  for  rural  and  Savai'i-based  business\nenterprises. Use of alternative securities for freehold land\nhas  been  limited.  Although  chattels  were  used\nextensively for security,  the  commercial banks no longer", "place reliance on such security because of enforceability\nproblems and the state of the relevant registries.\nSince 1996, the Government has embarked on a process\nof economic reform and liberalization, which recognizes\nthe private sector as the engine of growth. The reform\nprocess has resulted in an environment that is conducive\nto economic growth.\nThe Government's statements of economic strategy have\nconsistently  reinforced  the  partnership  between  the\nprivate sector and Government. After focusing on major\nmacroeconomic  reforms,  the  Government  is  now\ndeveloping strategies to broaden the spread of benefits of\neconomic  growth.  ADB  has  supported  these  efforts\nthrough Financial Sector Program loan. A key component\nof these strategies is the development of infrastructure of\nthe  village  economy,  which  centers  around  MSEs.\nImproving MSEs access to credit, supported by improved\naccess  to  services  provided  by  business  development\nservice providers, will contribute to growth in employment\nand  income  earning  opportunities  in  this  sector.  The\nProject reflects the ADB poverty reduction strategy.\nObjectives and Scope The Project's goal is to generate income and employment\nopportunities by expanding the MSE sector by improving\naccess  of  MSEs  to  credit,  and  business  training  and\nadvisory services. The Project has four components: (i)\nexpand the small business loans guarantee scheme, (ii)\nsupport a pilot microfinance facility, (iii) enhance business\nadvisory and training services, and (iv) improve the policy\nand  legislative  environment  for  small  business\ndevelopment.\nCost Estimates The total cost of the Project is estimated at $4.5 million\nequivalent including taxes and contingencies.\nFinancing Plan ADB loan financing is proposed at $3.5 million equivalent\n(78 percent of the total costs). Government financing will\namount to $1.0 million equivalent (22 percent).\nLoan Amount and Terms The equivalent in various currencies of Special Drawing\nRights 2,697,000 ($3.5 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds\nresources, with a maturity of 32 years, including a grace\nperiod of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0 percent\nper annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per\nannum thereafter, to be paid semiannually.\nEquity Investment ADB will subscribe up to the equivalent of 25 percent of\nissued and paid-up capital in a Samoan venture capital\nfund (VCF). ADB\u2019s investment will be up to $400,000.", "The overall size of the VCF is proposed at $1.6 million.\nOther  primary  shareholders  are  likely  to  be  the\nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC), the Australia and\nNew  Zealand  Banking  Group  Ltd,  DBS,  and  Samoa\nNational Provident Fund. The target market for the VCF\nwill be venture capital investments of up to $100,000.\nProject size is expected to range from roughly $67,000 to\n$400,000  equivalent,  with  a  majority  being  expansion\nprojects. The life of the VCF is proposed at 10 years. Exit\noptions  for  the  VCF  will  be  existing  shareholders  of\ninvestee companies. Commercial financiers will provide\ntake-up  when  the  specific  business  matures  and\nbecomes bankable under conventional criteria.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2006.\nExecuting Agency Treasury Department\nImplementation Arrangements The  Treasury  Department  will  constitute  a  project\nsteering  committee  (PSC)  at  project  start-up,  with  the\nsecretary of finance as the chair. The PSC will establish a\nsubcommittee  to  manage  the  SBDF.  The  PSC  will\nestablish  a  project  management  unit  (PMU),  with  a\nmanager recruited from the private sector. DBS will be\nthe Implementing Agency (IA) for the onlending of the\npilot microfinance component. The Women in Business\nFoundation  (WIBF)  will  be  the  initial  participating\norganization for the microfinance component. SBEC will\nbe the IA for the SBLGS component. Business training,\nmonitoring, and advisory services  components  to  be\nfunded under the SBDF will be awarded to accredited\nparticipating  organizations  (initially  identified  as  SBEC\nand WIBF), based on medium-term work plans submitted\nby  the  participating  organizations,  and  approved  for\nfunding from the SBDF.\nProcurement All  procurement  under  the  Project  will  follow  ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement. The PMU will be responsible\nfor all procurement. Vehicles, computers, and other office\nequipment  will  be  procured  subject  to  international\nshopping procedures or direct purchase, depending on\nthe contract amounts involved.\nConsulting Services A PMU manager will be engaged for the duration of the\nProject.  Furthermore,  a  systems  specialist  will  be\nengaged  for  6  person-months.  A  small  business\ndevelopment expert will be engaged for up to 5 person-\nmonths, and auditors on an annual basis. Furthermore,\nLegal experts may be engaged as required to facilitate\ndrafting  of  various  agreements  under  the  Project.  All\nconsultants to be financed out of the loan proceeds will", "be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory\nto ADB.\nEstimated Project Completion 28 February 2006.\nDate\nBenefits and Beneficiaries The Project will contribute to poverty reduction through\nimproving  access  of  micro-  and  small  enterprises  to\ncredit,  and  business  development  services,  thus\nfacilitating income-generating activities. It is expected that\nduring  the  five  years  of  project  implementation,  the\nProject  will  directly  create  an  additional  1,400  direct\nincome and employment opportunities, benefiting at least\n5,600 people.\nThe specified target group for this Project includes rural\nhouseholds with residences outside of urban Apia, and\nno direct income stream from paid employment in Apia.\nThere are no specific poverty areas or geographic areas\nthat would require priority support. The most important\ntarget groups in this Project are small entrepreneurs, both\nmale and female, that would like to expand or consolidate\nexisting  businesses  and  require  additional  financial\nresources for this purpose.\nThe Project will facilitate diversification of the financial\nsector  in  Samoa,  logically  extending  policy  dialogue\ninitiated  under  the  Financial  Sector  Program.  Also,  by\nimproving the legal and regulatory environment pertaining\nto  entrepreneurship  development,  the  Project  will\nfacilitate private sector-led economic growth.\nRisks Risk areas for the Project include continuing adherence\nof the Government to public sector reforms and private\nsector development in the aftermath of the parliamentary\nelections  scheduled  for  the  first  half  of  2001.  More\nspecifically, issues related to customary land reforms may\nprove to be sensitive. Also, while current macroeconomic\nconditions are quite stable, underpinned by robust private\nsector  growth  and  continuing  strong  remittances  from\nabroad, these conditions may deteriorate, either because\nof the slower growth in exports, due to market changes,\nor  decline  in  remittances.  Samoa  will  always  be\nvulnerable to natural disasters similar to the devastation\ncaused by the two major cyclones in 1990 and 1991, and\nthe adverse impact of taro leaf blight disease in 1992-94.\nFurther risks could arise from the weak demand for the\nSBEC  credit  guarantee  scheme,  slow  take  up  of\ninvestments by the VCF, and unforeseen weakening of IA", "institutional capacities. An additional risk is that VCF will\nnot materialize despite all the preparatory work.\nThese risks are considered acceptable due to the recent\nrecord  of  the  SBEC  credit  guarantee  scheme,  and\ndemand  assessments  conducted  during  the  VCF\nfeasibility study. Risks related to the VCF will be mitigated\nby the fact that any actual investment of ADB in the VCF\nis  contingent  on  IFC  participation,  as  a  lead  investor.\nAlso, continuing strong growth of Samoa's economy will\nunderpin  demand.  The  Project  will  include  mitigating\nmeasures  directed  at  institutional  strengthening  of  the\nIAs.\nTechnical Assistance ADB will provide technical assistance (TA) for Capacity\nBuilding  of  Financial  and  Business  Advisory\nIntermediaries.  The  TA  will  support  (i)  policy  and\nlegislative  reviews;  (ii)  institutional  strengthening  of\nSBEC, DBS, WIBF, and other participating institutions;\nand (iii) the setting up an upgraded chattels registry and a\nnew  credit  reference  scheme.  Consultants  will  be\nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants.\nThe  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $575,000  equivalent,  of\nwhich  $365,600  is  the  foreign  exchange  cost  and\n$209,400  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will\nprovide $365,600 to finance foreign exchange costs, and\n$134,400 equivalent for local currency costs, on a grant\nbasis from the ADB-funded TA program. This will cover\nconsulting  services,  training,  and  equipment.  The\nremaining  local  currency  costs  will  be  met  by  the\nGovernment, through the provision of office space and\nfacilities, and counterpart staff.", "", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on (i) a proposed\nloan to the Independent State of Samoa for the Small Business Development Project; and (ii) a\nproposed  equity  investment  in  a  Samoa  venture  capital  fund.  The  report  also  describes\nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Capacity Building of Financial and Business Advisory\nIntermediaries, and if the proposed loan and equity investment are approved by the Board, I,\nacting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall approve the TA.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. During the 1999 Country Programming Mission to Samoa, the Government requested\nTA to develop a small business development project for the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nfinancing in 2000.1 ADB was to examine the feasibility of different components for such a\nproject, including (i) a dedicated credit line and/or guarantee scheme for micro- and small-\nenterprises (MSEs); (ii) a pilot microfinance scheme; (iii) capacity building through the provision\nof business advisory services; and (iv) an equity participation in a proposed venture capital fund\n(VCF) being developed with the help of the South Pacific Project Facility (SPPF).2 The TA was\nincluded in the 1999 country program, and the TA consulting team commenced work in Samoa\nin March 2000. The ADB Appraisal Mission3 visited Samoa from 31 July to 9 August 2000. The\nproject framework for the proposed Small Business Development Project is in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA. Sector Description\n1. Macroeconomic Context\na. Country Background\n3. Samoa is an archipelago of seven islands located in the South Pacific, approximately\n2,400  kilometers  (km)  northeast  of  New  Zealand.  The  total  population  of  the  country  is\nestimated at 170,000. The average population density is 56 persons per square kilometer (km2),\nalthough a large majority live in the coastal areas of the two main islands of Upolu (72 percent\nof the population) and Savai'i (27 percent). About 35,000 (over 20 percent of the population) live\nin Apia, the capital, on the island of Upolu. Because of the geographically compact nature of the\ncountry and the existence of a good road and shipping network, transport between and within\nislands is relatively easy, and access to Government services is generally good.\n4. Samoa has a total land area of 2,820 km2, with an exclusive economic zone of 98,000\nkm2, the smallest in the Pacific. About 43 percent of the land area is classified as arable, and\napproximately 75 percent of the population still use land and coastal resources as a main or\nsupplementary source of income. However, Samoa is ecologically fragile and vulnerable to\n                                                          \n1\nTA 3262-SAM: Small Business Development, for $150,000, approved on 24 September 1999.\n2\nSPPF was established in 1990 by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) with additional funding from\nAustralia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, and IFC. SPPF\u2019s mission is to assist and accelerate the development of\nproductive, self-sustaining, small and medium-sized, private sector entrepreneurs in Pacific island countries. ADB\nalso  supports  SPPF  through  RETA  funds  (TA  5891-REG: South Pacific Project Facility II: Private Sector\nDevelopment Support, for $300,000, approved on 23 December 1999).\n3\nThe Mission comprised E. Zhukov, Financial Sector Specialist and Mission Leader; R. Clendon, Sr. Counsel; C.\nKim, Investment Officer; V.V. Cuong, Financial Analyst; and W. Parr, consultant.", "2\nenvironmental degradation and cyclones. An estimated 30 percent of agricultural production\ntakes place in areas with severe soil limitation and the clearing of steeper slopes increases the\nvulnerability to erosion.\nb. Public Sector/Financial Sector Reforms\n5. The Government has been engaged in extensive public sector reforms since the mid-\n1990s.  Recent  reforms  have  emphasized  improving  the  budget,  supporting  the  strategic\nplanning system, devolving some responsibilities to line agencies, introducing performance-\nbased budgeting, and restructuring state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Between 1987 and 1996,\n21 SOEs were liquidated or privatized. More recent reforms included privatization of Samoa\nBreweries Ltd, Samoa Iron and Steel Ltd, and BOC Gases Ltd. The Government corporatized\nthe Post and Telecommunications Department into Samoa Communications Ltd in July 1999.\n6. With the ADB-financed Financial Sector Program (FSPL),4 since 1998 the Government\nhas been introducing far-reaching financial sector reforms. These reforms include (i) removing\nall credit ceilings and interest rate controls as of 1 January 1998; (ii) phasing out the liquid\nassets ratio as of September 1999, (iii) using of auctions as the primary monetary policy\ninstrument of the Central Bank of Samoa (CBS); (iv) allowing commercial banks to make\nforward exchange contracts from mid-1998, and removing a 1 percent levy on foreign exchange\nsales from January 1998; (v) partially removing foreign exchange controls on current account\ntransactions; (vi) allowing approved entities to operate as foreign exchange dealers effective\nfrom mid-1999; (vii) closing the export financing facility, which provided funds for exporters at\nsubsidized rates; and (viii) strengthening the capacity of CBS, to manage liquidity and undertake\nprudential supervision, and of the National Provident Fund (NPF) and the Development Bank of\nSamoa (DBS).\nc. Recent Economic Performance and Prospects\n7. In 1999, the growth rate of the Samoan economy accelerated to 5.3 percent, from 3.4\npercent in 1998. This reflected a 7.3 percent expansion in the tertiary sector, which accounted\nfor 56 percent of gross domestic product (GDP); a 4.4 percent expansion in the secondary\nsector, which accounted for 23 percent of GDP; and a 2.4 percent expansion in the primary\nsector,  which  accounted  for  21  percent  of  GDP.  Within  the  tertiary  sector,  strong  growth\noccurred in hotels and restaurants (17.8 percent), largely as a result of a 9 percent increase in\ntourist  arrivals  attributable  to  end  of  the  millennium  celebrations.  Transportation  and\ncommunication, also stimulated in part by tourism growth, increased output by 13 percent; while\ncommerce increased output by 8.4 percent, continuing the steady growth that has made it the\nlargest sector of the economy since 1997. Public administration maintained its share of GDP,\ngrowing by 5.1 percent, and personal and other services grew by 4.7 percent. Within the\nsecondary sector, notable growth of 13.4 percent was recorded in the construction sector, as\nboth  public  and  private  sector  projects  took  output  to  a  record  level.  Food  and  beverage\nmanufacturing declined slightly as a result of temporary closure of the coconut oil mill; but other\nmanufacturing increased output by 1.3 percent as the Yazaki automotive assembly operation\nrecovered from the effects of the Asian crisis, and a new garment factory began production.\nWithin the primary sector, fishing grew at 6.1 percent, compared with 31.8 percent in 1998,\nwhile  agriculture  production  was  down  by  1.1  percent.  The  growth  acceleration  was\naccompanied by a drop in the inflation rate to 0.3 percent, from 2.2 percent in 1998. Declining\n                                                          \n4\nLoan 1608-SAM (SF): Financial Sector Program, for $7.5 million, approved on 19 February 1998.", "3\nlocal food prices more than offset a rise in import prices attributable to tala depreciation and\nhigher prices of Samoa\u2019s major suppliers.\n8. The balance of payments remained in overall surplus of ST0.01 million in 1999, with a\ncapital account surplus just exceeding a current account deficit of ST58.3 million (8.1 percent of\nGDP). The latter, more than double the 1998 deficit despite tourism growth and a 14 percent\nincrease in private remittances, reflected a 22 percent surge in imports driven by the growth in\ndomestic demand and the one-off import of a Government vessel. Merchandise export earnings\nwere  stagnant  in  aggregate:  although  domestic  export  earnings  rose  10  percent,  reexport\nearnings fell from the unusually high level of 1998. Net foreign assets reached ST183 million,\nproviding 6.3 months of import cover. The Government\u2019s external debt declined to ST431.2\nmillion at the end of 1999, or 60 percent of GDP; while debt servicing costs as a percentage of\nmerchandise exports reached 17.9 percent.\n9. Government finance statistics show that, for the fourth fiscal year in succession, the\nGovernment ran an overall budget surplus in 1998-99, equivalent to 0.3 percent of GDP,\nalthough an overall deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP was budgeted. Revenue was slightly below the\noriginal budget estimate because of a shortfall in tax revenue, but the current balance was close\nto expectations because of below-budget current expenditure. Externally funded development\nexpenditure was also below the budgeted level because of delays in the start-up of some\nprojects. As a result of the surplus, the Government increased its net deposits in the banking\nsystem, reinforcing the absence of crowding out pressure on the private sector. In fiscal year\n1999/2000, an overall deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP was budgeted, to be financed by external\nborrowing. Revenue and current expenditure were projected to rise by 8.2 percent and 6.6\npercent leaving a current surplus of 3.4 percent of GDP. Budget outturns for the first half of the\nfiscal year were broadly in line with budget estimates. However, it was questionable if above-\nbudget tax revenue collections would continue to offset a shortfall in nontax revenue, and if the\nGovernment would be able to achieve the targeted improvement in its net credit position with\nthe banking system.\n10. Broad money supply (M2) increased by 13 percent in 1999, compared with 5 percent in\n1998. This expansion was entirely attributable to a rise in net domestic assets, with credit to the\nprivate sector growing by 17.6 percent. Credit extended to public institutions increased by 4.2\npercent;  while  Government  reduced  its  net  credit  position  by  5.8  percent,  partly  to  make\nadvance payments on overseas debt to avoid possible year 2000 computer problems. All\ncategories of commercial bank loans to the private sector showed significant growth, including\nloans to agriculture, forestry, and fisheries. This last development demonstrated the impact of\nfinancial sector liberalization. Historically, banks were reluctant to lend to the primary sector, not\nonly because of problems in obtaining acceptable security for loans, but also because direct\ncontrols on interest rates prevented the charging of a sufficient risk premium in lending rates.\nWith the removal of direct controls in the financial sector, loans to agriculture, forestry, and\nfisheries have grown from ST1.50 million in 1997 to ST4.5 million in 1999. The weighted\naverage lending rate of commercial banks fell slightly to 12.6 percent in 1999, from 12.8 in\n1998, while the weighted average deposit rate remained at 5.1 percent. The interest rate spread\nthus declined to 7.5 percent in 1999 and has remained at that level in 2000 as lending and\ndeposit rates both fell by 0.2 percent.\n11. In the context of ongoing stability in the macroeconomic environment, and continued\nimprovement in the microeconomic policy environment, an economic growth rate of around 4\npercent is expected in 2000. Allowing for the seasonal downturn in economic activity that\ncharacterizes the first quarter of the year, tourism remained robust early in the year; and a", "4\nsubstantial public investment program will stimulate the construction sector. Agriculture is likely\nto continue to depress the aggregate growth outcome by stagnating or declining for the fourth\nyear  in  succession,  underlining  the  importance  of  its  prioritization  in  the  Government\u2019s\nStatement of Economic Strategy 2000\u20132001 (SES).\n2. The Small Business Sector\n12. Most of the private sector enterprises in Samoa are MSEs. The Business Activity Survey\nfor 1994, largely covering enterprises registered with NPF, showed that there are about 586\nMSEs in Samoa. Formal private sector enterprises (excluding the Yazaki plant) employ a total of\n7,643. About 80 percent of these enterprises employ less than 20 employees. A more recent\nstudy commissioned by the Department of Trade, Commerce and Industry (DTCI), which also\nincluded self-employed people with business licenses, identified a total of 1,528 businesses,\nwith over 80 percent having 5 employees or less.\n13. Government policies do not differentiate between various sizes of businesses other than\nthrough  the  value  added  goods  and  service  tax  (VAGST)  Act  1998,  which  principally\ndifferentiates on the basis of turnover. The VAGST threshold is currently set at ST52,000. The\nformal  private  sector  characteristics  can  be  determined  in  general  terms  through  various\nsources  of  data  collection,  principally  business  licenses,  VAGST  registrations,  and  NPF\ncontributions. Over 50 percent of all businesses operating in the formal sector are owner or\nfamily operated, with no employees, with a further 39 percent having 5 or less employees.\n14. The formal sector is dominated by retail trade activities, with a total of 1,071 businesses\nregistered for VAGST as of 31 March 2000. This represents a 49.3 percent increase over the\n717 businesses identified in the 1997 Bioglobal Pacific/DTCI study. The hotel and restaurant\ntrade, at 138 businesses, recorded a 40.8 percent increase in the two years following the\nBioglobal study. Substantial growth has occurred in fisheries, with in excess of 400 aluminum\nboats now operating in the tuna industry. GDP grew by 7.0 percent, at current market prices\nover the six years from 1994 to 1999, with most of that occurring since 1996. The low entry\ninvestment cost for boats, high returns, and the resolution of issues relating to market access by\nestablishing a number of fish processing plants has led to this prolific growth. The private sector\nclaims the credit for fisheries development. However, because fishing activities are exempt as a\ntaxable income, Inland Revenue does not capture data.\n15. Because agricultural producers do not need a license and are exempt from taxation, no\nsubstantive data exists from which the size and nature of the informal MSE sector can be\nestimated.  However,  some  data  sources  can  be  used  to  make  provisional  assumptions.\nNationally,  11.2  percent  of  all  annual  household  income  comes  from  the  sale  of  surplus\nproducts or handicrafts; only 3.3 percent of income from the individual businesses. Although a\npercentage of the population rely heavily on the sale of home-grown or produced items as their\nmajor source of income, the implication here is that generally, Samoans do not regard such sale\nas a business activity, but rather a surplus from subsistence-type lifestyles. Table 1 provides a\nsummary of household income sources.", "5\nTable 1: Sources of Household Income\nSource of Income Value % of Total\n(ST\u2019000)\nPaid Employment 130,665 53.7\nSale of Fish 6,421 2.6\nSale of Coconuts 5,312 2.2\nSale of Handicraft 13,796 5.6\nOther Home-Grown Sales 2,035 0.8\nMoney from Business 8,056 3.3\nRemittances\n\u2013Abroad cash or in kind 39,699 16.4\n\u2013Local, cash or in kind 12,705 5.2\nPensions in Samoa 4,597 1.9\nOther Sources 19,634 8.0\nTotal 242,918 100\nSource: 1998 Household Survey.\n16.

Comprehensive data is not available to assess the nature of activities undertaken by the\nmicroenterprise sector. The Small Business Enterprise Centre (SBEC) is the only organization\noperating within the definition of the MSE as used for this Project. SBEC has a cross-sectoral\napproach, as opposed to the Women in Business Foundation (WIBF), which has a very specific\nfocus.

Recent economic reforms and liberalization have created a new, private sector-oriented\nclimate, and new opportunities. A new generation of youth is growing up with aspirations other\nthan working on the land. Rural society in Samoa is still in the earliest stage of being affected\nand  mobilized  by  the  new  climate  created  by  macroeconomic  reforms.  The  potential  for\nentrepreneurship development is considerable.\n3. Financial Services\n19. The main players in the financial sector are three commercial banks, two major nonbank\nfinancial institutions\u2014DBS and NPF\u2014and a small network of about 20 active credit unions.\nLoans for small enterprises are also extended by a few private finance companies and a few\ninformal types of financing arrangements. The Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Bank (Samoa)\nis the largest among the commercial banks, followed by the Pacific Commercial Bank, which is\na joint venture between Westpac Banking Corporation and the Bank of Hawaii, and the National\nBank of Samoa. Among the nonbank financial institutions, NPF is the dominant player in the\ndomestic credit market (Table 3 illustrates the distribution of financial assets and loans).\nTable 3: Total Assets and Loans and Advances\n(as of 31 December 1999, ST million)\nInstitutions Total Assets Loans and Advances\nCommercial Banks\nANZ Bank (Samoa) Ltd 226 146\nPacific Commercial Bank 103 56\nNational Bank of Samoa 23 14\nTotal Commercial Banks 352 216\nNonbank Financial Institutions\nNational Provident Fund 175 108\nDevelopment Bank of Samoa 59 53\nNational Pacific Insurance 22 0\nSamoa Life Assurance 22 11\nPublic Trust Office 9 7\nHousing Corporation 13 12\nTotal Nonbank Financial Institutions 300 191\nTotal 652 407\n20. The three commercial banks comprise only a little more than half of the total loan assets\nheld by financial institutions generally, the remainder are held by nonbank financial institutions\nsuch as NPF, DBS, insurance companies, and also a largely invisible, but widely spread,\nsystem of credit unions. Among the three commercial banks, ANZ Bank, as the successor to the\nBank of Western Samoa, holds a dominant share in terms of total assets. It is a full service\nuniversal bank catering to the whole range of retail and commercial clients, including customers\nfrom the small enterprise sector. The Pacific Commercial Bank (PCB) focuses primarily on high\nnet worth clients, while the National Bank of Samoa is the smallest and most recent entry into\nthe Samoan banking system, wholly owned by private Samoan individuals, and positioned as\nthe bank catering for indigenous Samoans and clients from the lower retail end of the market.\nThe  National  Bank  of  Samoa  has  a  sizeable  part  of  its  current  portfolio  outstanding  with", "7\nSamoan small entrepreneurs. Considerable experience with development loans also rests with\nDBS, which is currently undergoing a restructuring with ADB support (Table 4 provides the\nportfolio composition of the financial institutions).\nTable 4: Portfolio Composition of the Financial Institutions\nNonbank Financial\nComponent Commercial Banks (%) Institutions (%)\n1998 1999 1998 1999\nBuilding, Construction, Land Purchase 39.7 38.5 48.9 50.0\nManufacturing 17.4 13.4 5.0 3.9\nTrade1 13.5 17.5 12.2 12.0\nAgriculture, Forestry, Fisheries 2.0 2.4 14.2 13.5\nTransportation, Storage,\n     Communication 6.2 5.8 2.9 4.3\nProfessional and Business Services 11.1 12.1 4.0 3.7\nOther Activities\nTotal 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0\n1 Including personal loans not classified elsewhere.\nSource: Central Bank of Samoa. 2000. Bulletin, March.\n21. The  financial  sector  reforms,  together  with  an  open  market  environment  and  the\npresence of a diversity of financial institutions, provide the background for the design of the\nproposals for project financial services arrangements. At the same time, while financial sector\nreforms have increased opportunities for financing of small businesses, gaps remain in the\nkinds of financing available. Thus, commercial banks remain constrained in their ability to\nprovide longer-term debt financing to small businesses, due to the short-term nature of their\ndeposit products. Without sources of longer-term funds, available liquidity cannot be used to\nextend longer-term maturities. In addition, due to the nature of the land tenure system in\nSamoa, where over 80 percent of the land is customary land held in accordance with Samoan\ncustom and usage, commercial banks often have a problem obtaining satisfactory security.\nFurthermore, venture capital financing of small businesses is difficult to obtain. While regional\nsources of financing exist, such as the Kula Fund and the Pacific Islands Investment Facility,\nnone cover enterprises of the small size common in Samoa.\n22. Against this background, the basic rationale of proposals to strengthen financial services\nfor small enterprises is to expand the quantity and quality of longer-term debt and equity, and\nassociated  financial  services  to  small  entrepreneurs  with  an  effective  demand  for  these\nservices. Specifically, the concurrent emergence of a less regulated and more competitive\nfinancial  sector  environment,  and  the  increasing  demand  for  investment  capital  for  MSEs\nprovide the justification for a focused initiative in this area. A more detailed review of the\nfinancial sector is presented in Appendix 2.\n4. Nonfinancial Business Development Services\n23. Several  organizations  are  involved  in  providing  nonfinancial  business  development\nservices  in  Samoa,  including  DTCI,  Samoa  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry,  Samoa\nManufacturers' and Exporters' Association, SBEC, and WIBF.\n24. SBEC, a major provider of business advisory services, was established by a deed of\ntrust in 1994 pursuant to an agreement between the Samoan and New Zealand governments.", "8\nIndependent of the Government, and currently with a staff of 23, SBEC is a major actor in small\nbusiness  promotion  in  Samoa  and  has  a  good  reputation.  Funding  from  New  Zealand  is\npresently secured up to June 2001, with an annual aid budget of $636,300 and around 10\npercent own earnings by SBEC. With its head office in Apia, a recently opened branch office on\nSavai'i, SBEC is presently active on Upolu and Savai'i islands. The SBEC's target clientele are\npotential and existing entrepreneurs throughout Samoa, in urban and rural areas. Target clients\nare categorized into size categories, with the smallest (enterprises with less than ST20,000\ninvestment, up to ST200 daily turnover, and up to 5 employees) accounting for 95 percent of\nclients. These small enterprises have received services free of charge.\n25. SBEC  services  are  in  the  fields  of  credit  guarantees,  business  planning,  and\nmanagement-related and business start-up training and consultancies. The credit guarantee\nscheme is implemented through the three commercial banks and DBS. Technically, loans of up\nto ST20,000 and up to two years duration are covered by a guarantee on the principal loan\namount. Guarantees are normally linked to participation in SBEC training and business planning\nprograms. In training, SBEC conducts basic management and business start-up courses such\nas  the  International  Labour  Organization's  Start  Your  Business  program,  retail  shop\nmanagement,  customer  services  programs,  special  courses  for  established  businesses  in\nfinancial management and marketing, as well as programs at the request of special groups,\ne.g., action planning and business planning for nongovernment organizations (NGOs). Around\n50  percent  of  small  entrepreneurs  attending  training  programs  become  regular  clients  of\nSBEC's advisory services later on. The SBEC's advisory services presently have 187 active\nclients.\n26. WIBF was established in 1990 as an NGO by a group of women who were facing\ndifficulties securing loans for their economic activities. WIBF's main objectives are to promote\nand advocate women\u2019s interests in business, to stimulate small business initiatives, and to\nprovide advisory and training services for MSEs in rural and urban areas. In practice, WIBF\npromotes microenterprise and income-generating activities by women and their families, mainly\nin rural areas of Samoa. From a small start in the early 1990s, the organization has grown is\nnow active in 81 villages; 16 villages are said to be on a waiting list for future activities. The\norganization thus is an important player in microenterprise promotion. WIBF maintains two\noffices, one in Apia and one on Savai'i. It is governed by a board of directors, has an executive\ndirector, and employs five full-time small business trainers, and two technical advisers for bee-\nkeeping  and  oil  extraction.  Six  local  consultants  are  employed  on  an  assignment  basis.\nRegional craft experts have been invited to teach or revive artisanal skills. WIBF has secured\nfunding from a variety of sources. The executive director indicated that over the last three years\nthe organization has received a total of about $270,000 for administration, vehicles, projects,\ntraining, and loan funds from the Canada Fund, New Zealand Official Development Assistance\n(NZODA), and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Apart from promoting\nincome-generating activities, WIBF is also involved in other fields such as the Junior Achievers\nProgram, a forum on suicide, counseling for young unmarried mothers, and the ECOWOMAN\nmovement based in the Fiji Islands. With improved focus, WIBF could probably develop and\ncapitalize on its strengths in microenterprise training and advisory services.\n5. Key Constraints\n27. Lack  of  information  on  the  MSE  sector  and  policy  formulation.  The  political\nenvironment is generally supportive of private sector development. While a special and separate\nMSE  promotion  policy  does  not  exist,  there  are  policies  related  to  and  relevant  for  small\ninvestment projects. In general, information on major parameters of businesses in Samoa and", "9\ntheir problems and needs is lacking, in particular on unregistered informal sector activities.\nWhile data for the formal sector of registered businesses indicate that around 80 percent of\nenterprises  have  up  to  5  employees,  no  data  is  available  for  unregistered  businesses  in\nagriculture and fisheries, cottage industries and handicrafts, some microscale trading, and other\nincome-generating activities.\n28. Land tenure. About 80 percent of the land is customary land. With freehold land as the\nmajor type of collateral required by banks, the land tenure system is a constraint in terms of\nenterprise  financing.  Related  to  this  is  the  value  of  long-term  land  leases  as  collateral\nsubstitutes.  While  long-term  leasing  of  plots  is  possible  and  common  outside  of  Apia,\nmortgaging these leasehold interests and using them as security for loans, is generally not\nconsidered permissible or practical at present under existing law. Land tenure is also a factor to\nbe considered when new premises are needed for a business or for expansion of agricultural\nproduction. While reform of the land tenure system is necessary and would be beneficial for\nbusiness and commercial agriculture development, other considerations, social and cultural,\nneed to be considered.\n29. Chattel mortgages. Because of the unsatisfactory nature of the registries recording\nsecurities granted over personal property (i.e., chattels), the commercial banks have been\nmoving away from the use of chattels as collateral, thereby reducing the options available to\nMSEs to obtain lines of credit. Financial institutions identify the Chattels Transfer Act 1975 and\nthe Companies Act 1955 as having several unsatisfactory features in this regard; both are\ncurrently being reviewed with a view to major amendment or repeal.\n30. Social  and  cultural  factors.  Particularly  in  rural  areas,  MSEs  are  operating  in\nenvironments characterized by traditional village and family authority and leadership, as well as\nhigh financial demands for social and cultural events, strong mechanisms of redistribution within\nextended family structures, and support to churches. Target incomes of rural households are\noften met by a mixture of subsistence production, some wage income, and some remittances of\nfamily members working abroad. Keeping money in the business can be difficult due to social\nreciprocity and redistribution requirements. This environment does not necessarily encourage\nbusiness activity; but rather provides disincentives for entrepreneurship.\n31. Markets  and  business  opportunities.  In  a  small  country  with  a  limited  domestic\nmarket, lack of markets and opportunities is a major constraint for enterprise development. The\nsmall enterprise sector can only grow if at the same time new and additional domestic as well as\nexport niche markets are identified and developed. For example, the existence of large Samoan\ncommunities abroad is an opportunity that hasn't been fully exploited. The same is valid for the\ntourist market in Samoa where the possibilities of raising the tourists\u2019 interest in cultural and\nhandicraft products seems to be far from fully exploited. There are other potential and new\nmarkets, e.g., in fishing, organic agriculture, agricultural processing, cut flower production, and\nexports, which provide potential for increased participation of small entrepreneurs.\n32. Entrepreneurship and business management capabilities. Some of the local social\nand cultural factors tend to discourage rather than encourage entrepreneurship. At the same\ntime, macroeconomic reforms and liberalization have created a new, private sector-oriented\nclimate, and new opportunities. The young are growing up with aspirations other than working\non the land. However, rural society is still in the earliest stage of being affected and mobilized by\nthe new climate created by macroeconomic reforms. The potential for entrepreneurship and\nbusiness development is unexploited. Due to lack of business experience, potential and existing", "10\nMSE  entrepreneurs  lack  entrepreneurial,  marketing,  production,  and  financial  management\nskills and competencies.\n33. Debt financing. In principle, credit is available for investment funding through products\nsuch  as  small  loans,  personal  loans,  or  term  loans  from  commercial  banks  and  nonbank\nfinancial institutions in all size categories up to around ST500,000. The constraints lie in the\nterms at which loans are given: repayment periods and collateral requirements.\n34. Credit  reference  facility.  The  absence  of  a  credit  reference  facility  also  frustrates\ncommercial lending institutions' processing of requests for finance by these small enterprises,\nparticularly  where  third  party  personal  guarantees  form  an  essential  aspect  of  security\narrangements.\n35. Equity financing. Representatives of the Samoa Chamber of Commerce and Industry\nand the Samoa Manufacturers' and Exporters' Association, as well as bankers, have repeatedly\nnoted that small enterprises need access to longer-term maturity funding rather than short-term\nloans, and in particular to equity rather than only credit. Equity needs of medium-size business\nmay have been catered to by some regional initiatives, but smaller enterprises have basically no\naccess to venture capital. This is the rationale behind the proposed Samoan VCF; Government,\nprivate sector, and representatives have repeatedly advocated improved provision of venture\ncapital to Samoan enterprises.\n36. Microfinance service providers. The introduction of the Grameen Bank approach with\nloans exclusively to women, and through joint collateral and the group mechanism was not\nsuccessful in Samoa. Apart from the WIBF, no specialized microfinance institutions exist in\nSamoa. Along with training and other services, WIBF provides some microfinancing but has\nbarely enough capacity to handle the current level of incoming external funding. However, there\nare institutions that provide financial services that fall in the microfinance bracket. A lack of\ncapacity among the pilot organizations to account and monitor the lines of credit, coupled with\nrestrictions imposed on the lending institutions, has prohibited them from offsetting the high\nrisks associated with lending to the target group with higher interest rates, and thus limited their\nparticipation in such schemes.\nB. Government Policies and Plans\n37. The Samoan economy is emerging from a process of transition, with a more market-\noriented environment now in place. The Government has embarked on a partnership with the\nprivate sector, with public sector policies and programs increasingly focusing on creating an\nenabling environment for the private sector. The Government is reinforcing this partnership by\nproviding  funding  to  the  Samoa  Chamber  of  Commerce  and  Industry  and  the  Samoa\nManufacturers' and Exporters' Association to purchase professional assistance to prepare policy\nsubmissions for Government consideration.\n38. The Government\u2019s policies are elaborated in the biannual SES (para. 11). The most\nrecent SES, covering 2000-2001 reinforces the Government\u2019s intention to achieve a more\nequitable distribution of economic benefits nationally, in particular to the rural areas and the\nvillage  economies.  Consolidation  of  Samoa\u2019s  position  as  a  competitive,  enterprise-based\neconomy will be pursued to ensure sustained economic growth. This growth is to be based on a\nstrong and diversified private sector. The SES emphasizes that the creation of employment\nopportunities through village and urban-based enterprises will be essential to sustain growth\nand spread the benefits throughout the economy.", "11\n39. In terms of policies to facilitate private sector-led growth, the Government proposes the\nfollowing measures: (i) improve availability of land for investment and utilize customary land as\ncollateral; (ii) provide a sound financial and business environment conducive to a thriving private\nsector; and (iii) support SBEC to provide assistance and training to small enterprises in urban\nand rural areas.\n40. Major reforms relevant to small business development have taken place in the areas of\ntax  and  tariff  reduction  and  simplification,  liberalization  of  the  financial  sector,  removal  of\nincentives, and corporatization or privatization of public sector assets. These reforms are having\na  positive  impact  on  the  economy.  As  part  of  freeing  up  the  economy,  the  Government\nintroduced a series of policy initiatives. Tariffs on imported goods have been streamlined and\nsimplified, with a smaller range of tariffs of up to 20 percent being imposed. The private sector\nhas responded positively to this move. The company tax was reduced to 29 percent, effective 1\nJanuary 2000, and as a trade-off for the removal of government incentives and tax relief\nholidays, accelerated write-off of depreciation is possible for new assets. The threshold below\nwhich no personal income tax is deducted was increased from ST8,000 to ST10,000.\n41. The Government also liberalized the financial sector, under its Financial Sector Program.\nBanks have generally responded favorably, and are now pricing credit according to the risk\nprofile of the applicant.\n42. The VAGST threshold was increased from ST30,000 to ST52,000, in recognition of the\nhigh compliance cost burden on microenterprises and difficulties in policing, but with higher\npenalties being imposed on those continuing to evade taxes. Business licenses were simplified\nby the Business License Act 1998. Inland Revenue now is the only institution involved in\nprocessing and issuing licenses. License fees have increased from ST200 to ST300 per annum,\nand generally no distinction is made on the size of the business. Fishing and agricultural\nactivities have been exempted from holding a business license or from paying VAGST.\nC. External Assistance to the Sector\n43. Under the NZODA bilateral aid program with Samoa, SBEC has received annual funding\nof  approximately  ST400,000  for  its  operational  costs  to  cover  the  delivery  of  a  range  of\nsubsidized or free-of-fee training and business advisory services to the MSE sector, with an\nemphasis on rural sector businesses with an asset base of less than ST20,000. Funding is\nsecured through until the 2001/02 fiscal year.\n44. To address some of the constraints facing small enterprises, NZODA also made loan\nguarantee scheme available to provide a guarantee for up to 90 percent5 of ST20,000 for a new\nor expanding business venture that is promoted by an SBEC client. The guarantee facility\ncovers 90 percent of the principal only, and the lenders are required to take the final risk for the\nremaining 10 percent, plus accrued interest charges on any default. The loan scheme is almost\nfully subscribed, with over 50 loans being guaranteed to date. The total guarantee fund is\napproximately ST600,000.\n45. In  Samoa,  NZODA  also  promotes  the  Pacific  Islands  Investment  and  Development\nScheme. The scheme provides ST1.8 million annual funding for the region, which includes both\n                                                          \n5\nNormal cover is up to 80 percent for two years, but with SBEC's director having the discretion to increase the\nguarantee up to 90 percent.", "12\nthe equity grant and development component. Proposals are submitted three times a year from\nthroughout the region and are assessed by a committee. Most rounds are highly competitive,\nand therefore only the best proposals from within the region go on to receive funding. NZODA\nalso supports WIBF, by (i) providing annual grants of ST75,000 to help with operational costs,\nand (ii) contributing to the microfinance facility.\n46. The Canada Fund has assisted village community microenterprise activities such as the\ndirect microextraction coconut oil process, and honey production projects of WIBF. Funding is\nfor asset purchases, such as vehicles and computers.\n47. UNDP implemented a $100,000 Microenterprise Financing and Savings Mobilization\nProject in 1996, initially using the Department of Women's Affairs as the executing agency. The\nproject was redirected to WIBF in 1997. WIBF is currently completing the final report on the\nproject, which was completed in December 1999.\n48. SPPF provides specialist assistance to entrepreneurs to source funding for commercially\nviable projects, generally in the ST150,000 plus range. However, in recognition of the size of\nprojects generally promoted in the Pacific, SPPF is now assisting projects valued as low as\nST100,000.\nD. Lessons Learned\n49. Several important lessons learned arising from ADB-financed projects in Asia and the\nPacific are relevant to the proposed Project. First, legal and regulatory reforms should precede\nor  at  least  accompany  direct  project  interventions.  Provision  of  lending  from  development\nfinance  institutions  has  been  less  than  successful.  Innovative  approaches  are  needed  to\nimprove the quality of financial services in the Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs).\nProject interventions in the financial sector have to be accompanied by reforms pertaining to\nland-related issues. While these reforms have proved to be a challenge, they can not be\navoided in the long term. An important lesson learned is that funding should be provided only to\ninstitutions  that  are  fully  autonomous  in  their  decision  making  and  management;  have\nidentifiable  performance  indicators;  and  are  accountable  for  their  performance  in  terms  of\nprofitability, efficiency, and risks reported under commercial financial management covenants.\nInstitutional strengthening of participating financial institutions is very important.\n50. Furthermore, financial services by themselves are not sufficient to facilitate growth in\nrural  areas.  Business  advisory  and  training  services  are  important.  Although  agencies  do\nprovide training and business advice to microentrepreneurs, including government agencies,\nbusiness advisory centers, NGOs, and business development units of development banks,\nthese services are not coordinated.\n51. In terms of Samoa, the most successful of the models dealing with access to credit has\nbeen the SBEC Small Business Loans Guarantee Scheme (SBLGS). To date, there have been\nno drawdowns against the guarantee facility despite it operating since 1994. The SBLGS has a\nstrong link between pre and post loan approval support, through a combination of training,\nbusiness  advice,  and  monitoring.  The  scheme's  strength  is  that  the  lending  institutions\nrecognize it as a guarantee of last resort, and therefore, any client must meet all normal bank\nlending criteria, other than collateral. The banks' involvement in the approval and subsequent\nmonitoring of repayment is a specific strength. The SBEC approach of combining training with\nbusiness advice, mentoring, and a loan guarantee scheme is a model that is working well in the\nPacific, although measures of performance continue to be based more on activities (number of", "13\ntraining courses held, number of clients seen) rather than a more qualitative approach of\nmeasuring the impact of the project. SBEC emphasizes training, but lacks human resources to\nprovide adequate and regular follow-up of its client base.\n52. SPPF has a good track record with the lending institutions, providing them with a full\nbankable document, covering all aspects of the business, including a full market and technical\nassessment. SPPF involvement in a project lends weight to the banks' favorable consideration\nof the loan request. SBEC feeds larger projects into SPPF and vice versa.\n53. WIBF  has  a  unique  holistic  approach  at  the  microenterprise  level,  which  combines\ntechnical  training,  basic  entrepreneurship  training,  and  microfinance.  WIBF  uses  a  project\napproach (for example, honey production or coconut oil), and takes the position of market\nintermediary, thereby resolving market access issues for low production capacity individuals.\nThe WIBF microcredit facility is an adaptation of the Grameen Bank model, and incorporates a\nsavings component.\n54. The microcredit scheme to the poorest of the poor provided by the International Fund for\nAgricultural Development (IFAD), in areas most affected by the devastating cyclones of 1990\nand 1991, only had limited success because of the narrow focus of its target group, which\nimposed a high delivery cost structure on the financial institutions involved: DBS, Samoa Credit\nUnion League, and commercial banks). The commercial banks did not have the distribution\nnetwork to be able to reach the target group, and DBS only achieved modest outreach to this\ngroup. Thus, the participating financial institutions (PFIs) were faced with high delivery costs, a\nnarrow focus group, and a capped interest rate. To qualify for access to loans, the applicant\ncould not have a regular income.\nE. ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n1. Operations\n55. Apart from the Financial Sector Program loan (para. 6), ADB has been supporting other\noperations in the financial sector over the last two and a half decades. ADB provided five credit\nlines to DBS in 1975, 1976, 1978, 1981, and 1984.6 Six TAs for a total of $950,000 were\nprovided  to  strengthen  DBS's  institutional  capacity.  All  five  development  finance  institution\nprojects with DBS were postevaluated. The projects were affected by adverse external events,\nincluding cyclones, economic recession, and fluctuating prices of agricultural goods. Partly as a\nresult of these but also because of internal weaknesses, DBS's operations suffered from large\narrears and unsatisfactory collection. Nevertheless, all ADB loans to DBS were rated as partly\nsuccessful in realizing loan objectives due to the high loan utilization rate and associated\nsocioeconomic benefits from its lending operations, DBS\u2019s ability to mobilize sponsors' funds,\nand its operational flexibility.\n                                                          \n6\nThe five lines of credit provided by ADB to DBS were (i) Loan 218-SAM(SF): Development Bank of Western\nSamoa, for $1.0 million, approved on 18 March 1975; (ii) Loan 287-SAM(SF): Second Development Bank of\nWestern Samoa, for $3.0 million, approved on 16 December 1976; (iii) Loan 366-SAM(SF): Third Development\nBank of Western Samoa, for $4.0 million, approved on 21 November 1978; (iv) Loan 527-SAM(SF): Fourth\nDevelopment Bank of Western Samoa, for $4.0 million, approved on 29 September 1981; and Loan 707-SAM(SF):\nFifth Development Bank of Western Samoa, for $4.0 million, approved on 15 November 1984.", "14\n56. Since 1987, ADB has provided five TAs for SOE privatization.7 With ADB assistance, the\nGovernment privatized and/or liquidated 25 SOEs over the last 15 years.\n2. Strategy\n8\n57. ADB\u2019s new poverty reduction strategy  states that enterprise development will be one\nway  to  enhance  poverty  reduction.  Enterprise  development  will  likely  be  handled  through\nintermediary institutions, themselves usually in the private sector. ADB will explore innovative\napproaches to encourage the private sector to extend financial services and marketing support\nto groups currently excluded. Private operators could be enabled to increase their participation\nin providing infrastructure and public services and in projects targeting the poor. However,\nregulatory  reform  will  need  to  precede  sector-specific  approaches  such  as  privatization,\ncontracting-out, and private-public partnerships. ADB will also seek to influence the quality and\nterms of employment by promoting better corporate governance and responsibility.\n58. ADB\u2019s strategy of assistance to Samoa is fully compatible with the Government\u2019s own\ndevelopment strategy. ADB is supporting the Government\u2019s reform measures, which are aimed\nat making the economy more private enterprise based and competitively structured. ADB will\ncontinue to support public sector reform, liberalization of the financial sector, promotion of\nprivate  sector-led  growth,  corporatization  and  privatization  of  SOEs,  improvement  of  the\nmanagement  of  power  and  urban  infrastructure  facilities,  and  reduction  of  inefficiencies  in\neducation, including the private sector demand-driven development of skills.\n59. Policy reforms and market infrastructure will be promoted to encourage the emergence\nof sustainable financial institutions geared to better serve the needs of medium, small, and\nmicroenterprises.  Sound  and  efficient  banking  systems  and  capital  markets  will  also  be\npromoted,  since  they  are  indispensable  for  providing  macroeconomic  stability,  mobilizing\nsavings, and ensuring availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor\ngrowth.\nF. Policy Dialogue\n60. The  Government  has  introduced  a  host  of  successful  reforms  in  the  areas  of\nmacroeconomic  management,  public  sector  restructuring,  privatization,  and  financial  sector\nliberalization. ADB continues to support9 Government efforts in these areas.\n61. Apart from supporting financial sector reforms, policy dialogue in areas relevant to the\nproposed Project has included issues related to (i) streamlining and updating company law and\ninsolvency law; (ii) streamlining dispute resolution arrangements, (iii) reforming the land law, (iv)\n                                                          \n7\nPast ADB assistance for privatization of SOEs as provided under: (i) TA 788-SAM: Rationalization and Privatization\nof Selected Government Corporations and Activities, for $310,000, approved on 5 August 1986; (ii) TA 1062-SAM:\nImplementing Privatization of Selected Government Corporations and Activities, for $270,000, approved on 10\nNovember 1988; (iii) TA 1234-SAM: Privatization of State-Owned Enterprises, for $365,000, approved on 28\nNovember 1989; (iv) TA 1631-SAM: Implementation of Privatization Exercise, for $320,000, approved on 24\nDecember 1991; and (v) Implementation of Privatization Strategy, for $600,000, approved on 7 June 1997.\n8 R179-99: Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development\nBank, 19 October.\n9\nTA 2788-SAM: Implementation of Privatisation Strategy, for $600,000, approved on 7 June 1997; TA 2989-SAM:\nInstitutional Strengthening of Government Financial Institutions, for $950,000, approved on 19 February 1998; TA\n2985-SAM: Strengthening Macroeconomic Policy and Planning Capacity, for $960,000, approved on 2 February\n1998, and TA 3311-SAM, Strengthening Macroeconomic Policy and Planning Capacity (Phase IV), for $690,000,\napproved on 25 November 1999.", "15\nreforming the legal framework related to security over moveable property; and (v) removing\nlegal barriers to competition. Most of these reforms have been endorsed by the private sector\nand are being considered by the Government.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n62. Since 1996, the Government has embarked on a process of economic reform and\nliberalization that recognizes the private sector as the engine of growth. The reform process has\nresulted in an environment that is conducive to economic growth. The Government SES has\nconsistently  reinforced  the  partnership  between  the  private  sector  and  Government.  After\nfocusing on the major macroeconomic reforms, the Government is now developing strategies to\nbroaden the spread of benefits of economic growth. A key component is the development of\ninfrastructure for the village economy, which centers on MSEs.\n63. Financial sector liberalization, together with the introduction of tax and tariff reforms, has\ncreated an environment more supportive of enterprise growth. The Government\u2019s increased\nemphasis  on  more  equitable  distribution  of  economic  benefits  nationally  is  leading  to\nimprovements in rural infrastructure. However, barriers still exist that could frustrate economic\ngrowth, particularly at the MSE level. The Project will seek to address these barriers through two\nparallel, but integrated lines of activity aimed at improving access to credit for MSE start-up,\nexpansion, and diversification, supported by business development service providers, who will\nbenefit from increased capacity and expansion of their existing services. Eighty-two percent of\nall businesses in Samoa have five or fewer employees.\n64. The potential for MSE development is considerable, particularly in the rural environment.\nA generation of youth is growing up whose aspirations are no longer satisfied by living in\nvillages and working on the land. Youth unemployment has emerged as a new phenomenon.\nWhile this is certainly somewhat an artificial phenomenon as long as extended families have\nenough land available, it reflects social and cultural change of Samoan society and changing\naspirations. Improved availability of financial and nonfinancial business development services\nwill result in the creation and expansion of MSEs and thereby contribute to the generation of\nadditional income and employment opportunities. The Project reflects ADB's poverty reduction\nstrategy and private sector development strategies. The Government is committed to forging a\nworking partnership with the private sector; this should be encouraged by ADB.\nB. Objectives and Scope\n1. Objectives\n65. Consistent with the Government's strategic objectives and SES, the project goal will be\nto generate income and employment for MSEs. The Project will have two parallel, but integrated\nobjectives for MSEs: (i) growth through improved availability of financial services, and (ii) MSE\ngrowth through improved access to business development support services.\n66. While facilitating and diversifying financial intermediation in Samoa, the Project will seek\nto address systemic issues related to faster market development, in particular by fostering an\nenabling environment for companies and a more fluid land market.", "16\n2. Scope\n67. The following four broad components are proposed for the Project: (i) expanded small\nloans guarantee scheme; (ii) pilot microfinance scheme; (iii) enhancement of business advisory\nservices; and (iv) improvements to the policy and legislative environment for small business\ndevelopment. In addition, an equity investment by ADB is proposed for a Samoa VCF.\na. Expanded Small Business Loans Guarantee Scheme\n68. The current credit guarantee scheme, SBLGS, administered by SBEC, which is now\nalmost fully committed, will be enhanced under the Project to accommodate increasing demand.\nThe SBLGS will be promoted and managed by SBEC, and be open to DBS and the three\ncommercial banks. The guarantee fund will be held by CBS; the funds will be owned by the\nGovernment. Interest earned on the principal invested will be reinvested as further capitalization\nof  the  guarantee,  and  should  be  sufficient  to  cover  any  defaults.  SBLGS  operation  and\nindemnity from liability for SBEC will be covered in a memorandum of agreement entered into\nbetween CBS and SBEC. Individual guarantees to entrepreneurs will be underwritten by the\nfunds held in trust by CBS. The director, SBEC will have the delegated authority and discretion\nto offer guarantees up to ST20,000. The guarantee will provide partial guarantee cover on the\nprincipal sum only, for approved, commercially viable ventures. Borrowers will be expected to\nmeet all other normal bank lending criteria. The SBLGS will be available to both clients of SBEC\nand any other participating organizations. Banks will be encouraged to copromote the scheme\nthrough their own client base, and to refer clients to the SBLGS for consideration. SBEC will be\nfunded through the SBDF to provide regular loan and client monitoring and support to clients.\n69. The existing scheme, which is almost 100 percent subscribed (up to the level currently\nagreed to by the board of trustees), has an upper limit of ST20,000 per guarantee (80 percent of\nprincipal)  over  two  years.  Recent  demand  for  the  SBLGs,  directly  associated  with  the\npenetration into the rural sector, exceeds supply. Discussions with financial institutions has\nidentified that although the scheme is generally well accepted, there is some concern that term\nloans in excess of two years are not covered for the life of the loan. Up to now, no guarantees\nhave been called in. The SBLGS will be modified so that guarantees issued will coincide with\nthe loan tenure, up to a maximum of five years.\n70. A  gap  exists  in  the  market  for  loans  ranging  from  ST20,000-ST50,000,  where\nbusinesses moving into second phase expansion have insufficient security to offer banks, and\nare therefore being restricted in their capacity to expand the business, thus limiting the creation\nof employment opportunities. The Project attempts to resolve this by making a second-tier\nguarantee available within the ST20,000-ST50,000 range, specifically targeting only existing\nbusinesses in an expansion and diversification mode, with the loan being covered by guarantee\nfor up to five years. Targeting the existing businesses will reduce the risk factor associated with\nthe higher guarantee level, as borrowers will need to demonstrate a proven track record in\nmanaging an existing business over a minimum time period in order to qualify. In both cases,\nthe proposal will need to meet all other normal bank lending criteria, including adequate debt to\nequity ratio, working capital, and demonstrated viability. Support for feasibility studies for the\nlarger projects could be provided by SPPF, given the limited capacity of SBEC to undertake a\nfull feasibility study to the bankable document stage. The director, SBEC will have the delegated\nauthority and discretion to offer guarantees up to ST20,000. Individual credit guarantees in\nexcess of ST20,000 will be submitted to a credit committee to be established within the project\nmanagement unit (PMU) for approval.", "17\n71. The fund will be invested in secure investments within the domestic financial markets,\nwith the interest earned being sufficient to cover any call on the guarantees. The guarantee will\nbe conditional on the payment of an application fee payable by the applicant on the sum\nguaranteed. Income  earned  from  the  application  fee  will  be  reinvested  into  the  guarantee\nscheme.\n72. PFIs will utilize their own funds for lending covered under the SBLGS. Final approval\nresponsibility for applications under this scheme will remain with the PFIs, with clients expecting\nto meet all normal bank lending criteria other than on the issue of collateral. The director, SBEC,\nwill be delegated the responsibility for offering credit guarantee support on amounts up to\nST20,000. A credit committee, comprising the manager of the PMU, a representative of the\nTreasury Department, and the director of SBEC, will approve requests for guarantees in excess\nof this amount. Access to the SBLGS will be limited to applicants who have an established\nongoing  relationship  with  SBEC,  and  are  agreeable  to  committing  to  regular  monitoring\nthroughout the guarantee period. SBEC will be funded through the SBDF to provide regular\nfollow-up and monitoring of entrepreneurs covered under the SBLGS.\n73. Services to be provided through the SBLGS include guarantees of up to 80 percent of\nprincipal with a minimum of ST5,000 and a maximum of ST20,000 with a term commensurate to\nthe term of the loan, at rates determined by the PFIs, with an application fee as determined by\nthe director of SBEC during periodic reviews in consultation with the project steering committee\n(PSC). The PSC delegates authority for approving guarantees up to ST20,000 to the Director.\nThe target group for this service will be both existing and first time MSEs. The SBLGS will also\nprovide  guarantees  of  up  to  80  percent  of  the  principal  within  the  range  of  ST20,000  to\nST50,000 with a maximum repayment term of five years at rates determined by the PFIs, with\nan application fee as determined by the SBEC director during periodic reviews in consultation\nwith the PSC. A credit committee will approve guarantees over ST20,000. The target group for\nthis service will be enterprises wanting to expand and diversify with a proven track record of\nprudent management of their enterprise. In each case, the guarantee will be considered a\nguarantee of last resort. The following eligibility criteria will apply for the SBLGS:\n(i)  Geographic Area. Guarantees can be granted for projects anywhere in Samoa.\n(ii)  Purpose. Guarantees can be issued only for legitimate and commercially viable\nbusiness  purposes  with  no  detrimental  environmental  or  social  impact.\nCommercial viability will be determined by SBEC and be revalidated by the PFI\nextending the loan. A commercially viable project should be able to demonstrate\nthe minimum following parameters:\n(a)  sensitivity analysis of the major project variables (normally income and\ncosts) will demonstrate that the project has the capacity to maintain a\nminimum of 1.0 x debt service cover after a 10 percent change in the\nmajor variables;\n(b)  minimum owners equity of 20 percent;\n(c)  minimum 10 percent net profit after tax by year two;\n(d)  adequate  market  research  to  confirm  the  availability  and  size  of  the\nmarket for the product/service proposed;", "18\n(e)  adequate management skills of the project sponsor; and\n(f)  financial  projections  are  used  to  formulate  realistic  underlying\nassumptions.\n(iii)  Borrowers. Guarantees can only be issued to permanent residents of Samoa.\nApplicants will be screened to ensure that they would not otherwise qualify for a\nbank loan.\n(iv)  Sectors. Guarantees can be extended to any sector, subject to periodic reviews\nas directed by the PSC from time to time, based on priority sectors determined\nby the Government in the SES.\nb. Microfinance\n74. CBS will set up a revolving fund facility and contract its management to DBS. The\nfacility\u2019s borrowing cost is estimated at 6.5 percent in tala. During the first two years of the\nexperimental period, DBS will borrow from the facility and finance the approved projects, which\nhad been prepared by WIBF and/or other participating organizations. The lending rate charged\nto  beneficiaries  is  expected  to  range  from  18-20  percent  per  annum.  WIBF  and  other\nparticipating organizations will get a flat commission fee of 5 percent of the principal for their\nassistance (project identification, advice, screening, appraisal, and monitoring services), while\nDBS will assume the credit risks of the microfinance portfolio. At the end of the experimental\nperiod, based on the Project\u2019s review mission conclusion as well as the result of the pilot\nprogram, the option to transfer the microfinance portfolio from DBS to WIBF and/or other\nparticipating organizations will be decided.\n75. DBS  will  assess  the  participating  organizations,  and  DBS  and  the  participating\norganizations will agree on a training and capacity building program. Upon the completion of\nthese training activities, the participating organizations will have the capacity, systems, and\nskills necessary to directly identify and manage a microfinance portfolio. The proposed training\nprogram will be submitted to a subcommittee of the PSC for consideration for funding and\nutilizing the SBDF. Opportunities to include other community-based institutions will be explored\nduring  the  process  of  the  first  two  years  of  the  experimental  period.  The  participating\norganizations should meet the following minimum criteria:\n(i)  Savings.  The  participating  organizations'  savings  mobilization  scheme  is\ncurrently operating and its client base is growing at least 10 percent per year,\nwith the client\u2019s average saving account balance not less than ST50.\n(ii)  Management.  The  participating  organization  must  have  a  sound  history  of\nmanaging microfinance loans and savings products, and be subject to annual\nexternal audits. At least one management officer should have trained or been\nretrained in a DBS training program under the business advisory service of this\nProject.  Key  project  and  business  advisers  must  have  been  trained  and\naccredited in the DBS program.\n(iii)  Geographic  Area.  The  participating  organization  must  have  the  potential  to\ncover  rural  and  urban  areas  nationwide  and  this  should  be  reflected  in  its\nbusiness/strategic plan.", "19\n(iv)  Purpose.  The  participating  organization  must  have  an  express  purpose  of\nhelping develop MSEs, and be capable of providing follow-up, monitoring, and\nsupport activities. Loans must therefore specifically focus on the enterprises\u2019\nproductive development, rather than consumption.\n(v)  Accreditation. The participating organization must satisfy DBS with regard to\nsystems, management capacity, application of detailed operational procedures\nfor loan application processing, monitoring, and supervision.\n(vi)  Loan. The microfinance facility must approve loans up to ST5,000, with a typical\nloan being in the ST1,000-ST2,000 range for an average period up to 3 years.\n(vii) Performance. The participating organization should target to have operational\nsustainability during the first three years of its operations and reach financial\nsustainability in year seven.\nc. Enhancement of the Business Advisory Services\n76. The Project will establish an SBDF, with the fund held by the Government, and invested\nin investment instruments. Management of the SBDF will be through a subcommittee of the\nPSC, comprising Treasury, DTCI, and DBS. The capital of the fund will be replenished on an\nannual  basis  throughout  the  five-year  life  of  the  project.  The  SBDF  will  purchase  support\nservices and training from participating organizations.\n77. The purpose of the SBDF is to provide a secure source of funding to expand the\ncapacity of NGO business development service (BDS) providers to deliver business training,\nadvice, and monitoring in response to the needs of the MSE sector.\n78. Existing  BDS  providers  have  expanded  their  services  into  the  rural  area,  although\npenetration and outreach is limited, largely as a result of a lack of resources to meet the needs\nand demands of MSE entrepreneurs. Both WIBF and SBEC have offices operating in Upolu and\nSavai'i, and both undertake regular field trips to monitor clients, provide training (both technical\nand  training),  and  in  the  case  of  WIBF,  manage  a  microfinance  facility.  With  combined\nexperience in excess of 15 years working in the MSE sector, both organizations recognize the\nneed to combine access to credit with other nonfinancial support services, if MSE enterprises\nare to succeed. However, delivery of services to the rural sector is time consuming and costly,\nand funding is insufficient to meet all the demands.\n79. The SBDF will purchase services from SBEC, WIBF, and other accredited POs on a fee\nfor service basis, based on agreed medium-term work plans, with measurable performance\nindicators.  Performance  indicators  will  emphasize  outputs  and  outcomes,  rather  than  just\nactivities. Services for funding consideration will include loan monitoring and follow-up of clients\nutilizing  either  the  guarantee  scheme  or  microfinance  facility.  The  BDS  providers  will  be\nexpected to recover a portion of the total cost of servicing the expanded client base through\nfees charged to the client.\n80. Annual contracts to training organizations for the provision of training, business advice,\nand mentoring, appropriately justified in relation to needs and demand, provided to a recognized\nstandard, will be funded through the SBDF. Only submissions from accredited or certified\nproviders will be accepted for consideration. Accreditation or certification will be handled by\nSBEC. Contracts will be approved on a competitive bid basis.", "20\n81. The following indicative benchmarks could be used to determine accreditation. (i) proven\ntrack record of professional competency in the delivery of entrepreneurial training or support, (ii)\nprofessional or academic qualifications of staff, and (iii) ability or willingness to bear 10 percent\nof the delivery cost either through their own resources or by a levy on the client base.\n82. The SBDF will link the activities of the microfinance facility and the loans guarantee\nscheme. Both organizations will use the fund to identify opportunities and develop programs\ntargeting the client base, in particular for training, advice, and loan monitoring support (Appendix\n3).\nd. Policy and Infrastructure Development\n83. Evaluation, review, and adoption of policy needs for the small business sector will be the\nmain output of this component. The component will concentrate on the creation of a better\nenabling environment for small business with an emphasis on reforms to corporate law, land law\n(particularly as it relates to customary land), and chattels. A new credit reference scheme will be\ncovered under this component.\n(i)  Company law. The Project will support the Government\u2019s ongoing overhaul of\ncompany law being conducted within the Justice Department;\n(ii)  Land law. The Project will seek to build on the recommendations made in a 1999\nUNDP  commissioned  report  including  revisions  to  existing  registration\nprocedures  for  customary  land  leases,  with  a  view  to  simplifying  these\nprocedures to facilitate the more economic use of customary land.10 A system of\nvaluation will be developed and the use of customary land leases as security will\nbe promoted among financial institutions;\n(iii)  Chattels registry. The registration of security interests for personal property is\ngenerally recognized as being in need of reform. The amendment or repeal of the\nCompanies Act 1955 will hasten that reform. Under the Project, the Chattels\nTransfer Act 1975 will be reviewed and recommendations made for legislative\nand administrative amendments. A new computerized system for registration of\nvehicles charged as security for loans will be introduced, perhaps in conjunction\nwith the ongoing modernization of the police recording system for vehicles.\n(iv)  Credit reference facility. The Project will promote establishing a database for a\ncredit reference facility; and the systems and rules for operating such a facility,\nan operational manual is to be produced for the database. A self financing model\nfor the proposed credit facility will be developed, and the facility will be set up\nwithin the private sector through the three commercial banks, the DBS, and NPF.\n                                                          \n10\nThis situation was identified by the Government in 1999 in considering the UNDP Report on Samoa: Legal and\nRegulatory Environment for the Corporate Sector to provide a basis for the clear use of customary land leases as\ncollateral for borrowings, particularly by the rural-based MSEs. The Alienation of Customary Land Act 1965\nprohibits Samoans without a Matai title to \u201clease or licence any customary land for agricultural or pastoral\npurposes\" (refer Section 3 of the Act). Such a prohibition could inhibit the development of MSEs in agricultural\nprojects.", "21\nC. Proposed Equity Investment\n84. The proposal for a VCF in Samoa arose as a result of the review of SPPF by the\nInternational Finance Corporation (IFC)/Admiralty Study on Pacific Islands Financing Needs\n1998. The study identified some generally available venture capital facilities in the region from\nsources including IFC's Pacific Island Investment Facility, and the Papua New Guinea and Fiji\nIslands-based Kula Fund. However, the former has a minimum investment limit of $100,000\n(approximately ST300,000), and the latter also supports larger projects and had until recently\nconfined itself to Melanesia. Preparatory work to define the modalities of such a fund has been\ndone by SPPF and IFC itself (more details are provided in the Appendix 4).\n1. Facility and Its Management\n85. The recommended structure is a 100 percent equity-financed facility, investing by way of\na range of equity and quasi-equity instruments with the preferred instrument being venture\ncapital loans. The internal rate of return for this structure is 8.6 percent, which is below what is\nexpected  in  more  mature  markets,  but  this  is  partly  attributable  to  (i)  very  conservative\nassumptions about the earnings of the typical investee company, (ii) delayed returns while the\ninvestee overcomes initial losses, and (iii) high provisions for losses on equity investments.\nLogically, a true VCF is preferably financed from equity. For Samoa, the proposed VCF is\nforecast to be substantially funding expansion projects, at a somewhat lower risk than true\nventure capital, and therefore some level of gearing is acceptable and lower loan losses are\nmore realistic.\n86. With VCF investments likely to be primarily in established businesses, projected loan\nlosses should be significantly less than might be the case with mainly seed capital or true\nventure investments. However, for the purpose of the model, a very conservative 25 percent\nloan loss provision has been allowed for the outstanding portfolio. This produces revenue losses\nfrom year 1, which may be too conservative an assumption when calculating internal rate of\nreturn, but is a prudent safety factor.\n87. The proposal is for the VCF to invest $240,000 (ST898,000) annually for seven years,\nusing total funding of $1,600,000 (ST5,987,000) from shareholders plus retained earnings. The\nprimary  shareholders  have  been  assumed  as  IFC,  ADB,  DBS,  NPF,  and  ANZ,  with  the\ncontributions from the DBS and NPF at 12.5 percent each, ADB at 25 percent, IFC at 40\npercent and ANZ 10 percent.\n88. A  two-tier  structure  of  two  legal  entities  is  proposed:  the  fund  (VCF)  and  a  fund\nmanagement company (FMC). An FMC is being formed in Samoa and structured in line with\nother  management  companies  operating  small  funds  elsewhere  in  the  world,  under  IFC\nsupervision. In addition to this and in line with IFC policy on skills and technology transfer and\ncapacity  building  in-country,  this  FMC  is  being  established  with  the  view  to  becoming  a\nstanding-alone facility in the long term and as a vehicle to attract local Samoan investors to\nsupplant  the  original  shareholders  over  time.  The  FMC  will  be  a  special  purpose  vehicle\nnominally capitalized by the investors and subsidized by assistance agencies. It will have a\nmanagement contract to oversee the VCF. The VCF board members will be appointed pro rata\nto shareholding, with ordinary shares carrying preemptive rights to enable primary sponsors to\nmaintain control of shareholding in the early years. FMC support staff will include three business\nanalysts and an administrative secretary. Two of the analysts are to be seconded for one to two\nyears from the DBS and the Samoa National Provident Fund to learn best practice equity and\nquasi-equity investment and transfer those skills back to their organizations.", "22\n89. The original base case assumes that the aid agencies will meet the cost of the chief\nexecutive officer's remuneration package, and other cash operating costs, for the first three\nyears, and the remuneration package thereafter. A model was prepared, which shows that the\nportfolio size will need to roughly double, to $3.3 million (ST12,349,000), to produce comparable\nreturns if all costs are borne by the VCF. As the structure is under review, these costs and how\nthey  are  to  be  met,  are  not  yet  finalized.  However,  the  Australian  and  New  Zealand\ngovernments have made an agreement in principle on meeting the original base-case operating\ncosts and salaries on a 50:50 basis for the first three years with a review for any additional\nsubsidies.\n2. Target Market and Investment Instruments\n90. VCF investments are likely to be primarily in established businesses. The target market\nfor the VCF is venture capital investments of less than $100,000 (ST374,200). Recommended\nlimits are ST50,000-ST250,000 with an upper limit of 50 percent of the total equity (including the\nVCF contribution) for existing businesses and 40 percent for new ventures. Project size is\ntherefore expected to range from roughly ST200,000-ST1,200,000 with between 70-80 percent\nlikely to be expansion or diversification projects. The investment focus will be on projects that\ncontribute to economic growth and, in particular, earn or save foreign exchange.\n91. The preferred investment instrument will be straight debt instruments\u2014venture capital\nloans\u2014because of the relatively small size of the investments, the cost of putting investments in\nplace, and to simplify exit options. While this is the simplest instrument, the VCF will be able to\nuse all other normally accepted equity and quasi-equity instruments subject to well-documented\ncriteria. The financial model is based on the venture loan option, which is likely to be used in the\nmajority of cases. The original base case recommended interest to be 20 percent per annum on\nventure capital loans to reflect the risk involved in unsecured investments. Commercial interest\nrates have been decreasing in Samoa, and the base will be adjusted to better reflect the market.\nOther income will be earned from application and establishment fees, each 1 percent of the\namount invested.\n3. Development Value\n92. There is a clear gap in the market for equity and quasi-equity funding for the large group\nof undercapitalized businesses. No formal mechanism exists for businesses to obtain venture\ncapital funding of less than $100,000 (ST374,200). This is placing a severe constraint on the\nability of the Samoan business community to generate growth in the economy. Therefore the\nVCF has the capacity to make a substantial impact on desired growth sectors generally, and\nwith particular emphasis on fishing, tourism, food processing, and manufacturing.\n93. Total investment by the VCF over 7-8 years of $1.7 million-2.7 million (ST63.5 million-\nST10 million), at the normal contributions of sponsor equity, could have a multiplier effect by\ncreating up to $10 million (ST37,420,000) of new investment over the period. That level of total\ninvestment would be expected to create a substantial number (estimated minimum 500, likely\nconsiderably more) additional jobs, vital to an economy where job creation is lagging well\nbehind other growth projections and is a major policy aim for the Samoan Government.", "23\nD. Cost Estimates\n94. The total cost of the Project is estimated at $4,464,000 equivalent. The cost estimates\nand financing plan are summarized in Table 5 with further details provided in Appendix 5. The\ntotal cost of the Project includes physical and price contingencies. The price contingency rate is\nassumed to be 4 percent of the base cost, while that of physical contingencies is 11 percent.\nTable 5: Summary of Project Costs, Equity Investment, and Financing Plan\n($'000)\nComponent Government ADB Total\nA.

ADB funding is proposed to include a loan of $3.5 million equivalent, from the Special\nFunds resources, and an equity investment of $400,000 from ordinary capital resources. The\nloan will have a maturity of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest\ncharge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nThe Borrower will be the Independent State of Samoa. The Government, as a counterpart\ncontribution, will finance the balance of $964,000 equivalent. The financing plan is summarized\nin Table 5 and details are presented in Appendix 5.\nF. Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Organization\n96. The Executing Agency for the Project will be the Treasury Department. The Treasury\nDepartment will constitute a PSC at project start-up, with the financial secretary or nominee as\nthe chair. Foundation members of the PSC will comprise all current members of the project\npreparatory TA advisory group, which are representatives from Treasury, DTCI, CBS, DBS,\nSBEC, ANZ, PCB, NBS, WIBF, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Samoa Manufacturers' and", "24\nExporters' Association. The PSC will be responsible for the overall guidance and direction of the\nProject  and  will  guide  to  the  PMU  on  coordinating  activities  between  the  various  Project\nimplementing agencies. The PSC will meet once every three months and give directions on\nproject implementation. The PSC chair will liaise with ADB on all project matters requiring the\nreallocation of project funds (Appendix 6 provides the organization chart).\n97. The  PSC  will  establish  a  three-member  subcommittee  to  oversee  the  SBDF.  The\nsubcommittee will likely comprise three members from within the PSC, who have no potential\nconflict of interest regarding SBDF operation, i.e., representatives of the Treasury Department,\nDTCI, and DBS. The PMU will be responsible for the day-to-day execution of the Project,\nadministration and financial reporting, coordinating the inputs of implementing agencies (IAs)\nand  TA,  and  providing  secretariat  functions  for  the  PSC  and  its  subcommittees.  Lessons\nlearned  in  Samoa  would  indicate  that  the  limited  capacity  of  Government  departments\nnecessitates the contracting out of selective PMU functions. The PSC will tender out PMU\nservice provision to the private sector, with the Treasury retaining management oversight and\nPMU monitoring. The PMU will need to ensure that ADB reporting requirements are satisfied\n(Appendix 7 includes the terms of reference for the PMU manager).\n98. DBS will be the IA for the onlending of the pilot microfinance component. WIBF will be\nthe  initial  participating  organization  for  the  microfinance  component.  DBS,  with  its  present\nexperience with the IFAD facility, will resume the lead in managing the pilot microfinance\ncomponent. The revolving fund will be available for DBS at a lending rate of 6.5 percent. The\nproposal of terms and conditions for funding applications will be stipulated in a memorandum of\nunderstanding signed by CBS and DBS.\n99. SBEC will be the IA for the expanded SBLGS with the participating organizations being\nthe three commercial banks, plus DBS. The IAs to provide business advice, monitoring, and\ntraining components, funded by the SBDF, will be accredited participating organizations, initially\nidentified as SBEC and WIBF. TA selection will be based on medium-term work plans submitted\nby the participating organizations, and approved by PSC for funding under the SBDF. To\nqualify,  the  participating  organizations  must  have  completed  the  institutional  strengthening\nprogram under the SBDF; clarify their target training, and advisory activities for intended clients;\nand estimate their achievable target with the time frame of the proposal. SBEC will follow up on\nproposals  and  report  the  results  to  the  PMU.  Based  on  the  participating  organizations\nproposals, SBEC will develop a fund-releasing plan, and submit it to the PMU. The PMU will\nreport to ADB on fund usage.\n100. The participating organizations that intend to use the fund should submit their proposals\nincluding the scale of the intended training programs and curricula for MSEs, outreach (urban\nand rural) and impact (direct and indirect, income and employment generation) of the program,\ncost-effectiveness analysis of the training programs, and their sustainability. A verification and\nimpact analysis will be made of major training activities after two months, and a summary of the\nimpact will be included in periodic reports to ADB.\n101. Policy implementation will be primarily enacted through DTCI, with support from the\nTreasury Department, in terms of the SES. The Justice Department will be the IA for the\nupgrading of the chattel registry, and a newly established independent agency representing\ninterested commercial banks will be the IA for the new credit reference facility. The collation and\nsummaries of pertinent indicators/data from various collection points (CBS, IRD, NPF, BDSs,\netc.) will initially be the responsibility of the PMU. Data will be analyzed and evaluated in\naccordance with the agreed monitoring and evaluation performance indicators for the Project as", "25\nset out in the project framework, and refined at project start-up. The database accumulated for\nthese indicators by the PMU will, prior to Project completion, be passed to the MSE policy area,\nproposed to be a function within DTCI.\n2. Project Performance Monitoring\n102. ADB will review progress with Project implementation through quarterly progress reports,\nto be submitted by Treasury Department, and regular review missions. The PMU will establish a\nproject monitoring and evaluation system based on the benchmarks and indicators specified in\nthe project framework within six months of loan effectiveness. The Government and ADB will\ncarry out a comprehensive midterm review of the Project at the end of the second year. The\nreview will assess the progress and achievements of the Project against its objectives, identify\ndifficulties being encountered, and recommend remedial actions if required.\n3. Project Implementation Schedule\n103. The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years,  starting  in  January  2001.  Project\ncompletion is expected in February 2006. The proposed project implementation schedule is\nsummarized in Appendix 8.\n4. Procurement\n104. All procurement under the Project will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The\nPMU will be responsible for all procurement. Vehicles, computer equipment, and other office\nequipment will be grouped into appropriate packages to elicit advantageous bids taking into\naccount the after-sales services and availability of spare parts. Indicative procurement packages\nare shown in Appendix 9.\n5. Consulting Services\n105. A PMU manager will be engaged for the duration of the Project, a systems specialist for\n6 person-months, a small business development expert for up to 5 person-months, and auditors\non an annual basis. Legal experts may be engaged as required to facilitate drafting of various\nagreements under the Project. All consultants to be financed out of the loan proceeds will be\nengaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other\narrangements satisfactory to ADB. Expanded terms of reference for the PMU manager and\nmanagement information system consultant are summarized in Appendix 7.\n6. Disbursements\n106. An imprest account will be established in CBS for the disbursement of loan proceeds.\nThe initial amount to be deposited will not exceed the equivalent of $350,000. Government\ncontributions to the Project will be maintained in a separate counterpart account. Items eligible\nfor financing under the imprest account are the local currency expenditures for the following\ncomponents: (i) SBLGS, (ii) microfinance, and (iii) business advisory services. Statement of\nexpenditures procedures will be used for the categories covered by the imprest account. The\nGovernment will establish four separate imprest fund subsidiary ledgers. These subsidiary\nledgers will cover (i) Part A - the SBLGS, (ii) Part B - the SBDF, (iii) Part C - the pilot\nmicrofinance facility, and (iv) the establishment and operation of the PMU. The subsidiary\nledgers will be used exclusively to record funds coursed from the imprest account for these\nseparate purposes, and will be reconciled on a monthly basis. After the initial deposit, the", "26\naccount will be simultaneously liquidated and replenished on a regular basis to ensure that\nsufficient funds are available for project implementation. For the proposed VCF, disbursement\nprocedures will be specified in the investment agreement.\n7. Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n107. The PMU will prepare quarterly progress reports for the Project for the periods ending 31\nMarch, 30 June, 30 September, and 31 December of each year, and submit them to ADB\nthrough the Treasury Department no later than 30 days after the end of the relevant period. The\nreports will be in a format acceptable to ADB and will include (i) information on the progress of\nproject implementation, (ii) implementation issues encountered and measures adopted for their\nresolution, and (iii) information on the status of compliance with loan covenants. The reports will\nalso include information on operation and performance of PFIs under the Project. The PMU will\nalso submit to ADB (i) brief monthly reports on project progress via fax or e-mail, and (ii) all\nreports prepared by consultants.\n108. The Government, acting through Treasury, will maintain consistent records and accounts\nadequate to identify goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. Treasury Department\nwill (i) maintain separate accounts for the Project; and (ii) ensure that accounts and related\nfinancial statements are audited annually in accordance with international accounting standards\nby auditors acceptable to ADB. Accounts of the VCF will be audited on an annual basis. The\nPMU will submit to ADB certified copies of the audited accounts and financial statements in\nEnglish within six months after the end of each fiscal year. The annual audit report will include\nthe audit of the imprest account and statement of expenditure procedures; and a separate audit\nopinion on the use of the imprest account and procedures. The annual audit of the SBDF by a\nfirm approved by ADB will be undertaken and forwarded to ADB within three months after the\nend of the half-year and fiscal year. Detailed quarterly reports of the financial position of the\nfunds, with itemized income and disbursements, will be sent to ADB every four months, within\none month after period end. A project completion report will be prepared three months after\nproject completion.\nG. Environment and Social Measures\n1. Environment\n109. The  potential  for  possible  negative  environmental  impact  from  the  Project  was\nexamined, and no significant adverse impacts were identified. Existing BDS provider activities\n(SBEC and WIBF) are governed by environmental policies promulgated by the various and\nagencies with which they work. Adequate systems exist to alert management of these BDS\nproviders to possible environmental implications from projects proposed by their client base.\nIntroduction of the environmental assessment guidelines for the SBLGS and microfinance loans\nwill be discussed with participating institutions.\n2. Social Analysis\n110. Initial social analysis was carried out during project preparatory TA (Appendix 10).\n111. The human development index for females in Samoa is 3 percent higher than that for\nmales, largely reflecting a higher life expectancy of 67 years, compared with 65 years for males.\nWomen\u2019s status as measured by the human poverty index is the same as men\u2019s. The primary\nand secondary enrolment ratios for females are 94 and 75, respectively; while total and teenage", "27\nfertility rates are relatively low by Pacific standards, at 4.2 and 26. Women constitute 32 percent\nof the workforce, but only 19 percent are in paid employment, although women occupy a\nnumber of senior positions in the public sector. There are currently two women members in\nParliament and one female minister. In general, women play a significant role in community\norganization and management; and distinctions drawn on the basis of gender are relatively less\ncommon in Samoa compared with other Pacific island countries. This partly reflects the high\nimportance placed on gender issues by the Government. In 1991, the Government established\nthe  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs  to  promote  the  advancement  of  the  social  and  economic\nposition of Samoan women; and in 1994, Samoa endorsed the Pacific Platform for Action,\nmaking an international commitment to promoting the advancement of women in practical and\nstrategic areas of development. Despite these favorable circumstances, economic participation\nby  women  is  constrained  by  such  factors  as  limited  access  to  credit.  This  issue  will  be\naddressed under the Project.\nH. Technical Assistance\n112. ADB  will  provide  TA  for  Capacity  Building  of  Financial  and  Business  Advisory\nIntermediaries. The TA will provide assistance to support (i) policy and legislative reviews; (ii)\ninstitutional strengthening of SBEC, DBS, and WIBF and other participating institutions; and (iii)\nthe setting up an upgraded chattels registry and a new credit reference scheme. Consultants\nwill be recruited in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n113. The TA is estimated to cost $575,000 equivalent, of which $365,600 is the foreign\nexchange cost and $209,400 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will provide $365,600 to\nfinance foreign exchange costs, and $134,400 equivalent for local currency costs. The TA will\nbe financed on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program, and will cover consulting\nservices,  training,  and  equipment.  The  remaining  local  currency  costs  will  be  met  by  the\nGovernment, through the provision of office space and facilities, and counterpart staff. The\ndetailed cost estimates and terms of reference are provided in Appendix 11.\nV. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Financial and Economic Analyses\n1. The SBLGS and Microfinance Components\n114. Financial and economic analyses were carried out for a typical range of projects to be\ncovered under the SBGLS, or financed through the microfinance facility, based on an evaluation\nof the client portfolio of WIBF and SBEC, and field visits by the project preparatory TA team.\nThe sample should be regarded as indicative only as other sub-borrowers activities will be\nincluded for financing under the Project. The analyses were undertaken to ensure that those\nsubprojects considered most likely to be financed under the Project could generate sufficient\nincome for subborrowers to repay their loans and generate surplus income.\n115. The selected subprojects are diversified to reflect the Project's intended geographic\ncoverage. Six subprojects have been chosen out of numerous rural finance proposals. Three of\nthe six focus on agricultural production, another two are applicable for both rural and urban\nareas, and the sixth focuses on commercial business in rural areas. The financing scope of\nthese subprojects ranges from the lowest initial investment of ST2,403 for a cocoa plantation to\nthe highest of ST38,500 for beach resort building activities. To compare the subproject, their\nfinancial plans were transformed into 10-year undertakings. In general, the summary of financial", "28\nanalysis confirms potential demand for sustainable funding in rural areas. Financial internal\nrates of return were estimated for selective subprojects with multiyear investments and returns.\nThe subprojects are delivering a range of acceptable returns from 17 percent to 169 percent. (A\nsummary  of  the  financial  and  sensitivity  analysis  of  selected  subprojects  is  available  in  a\nsupplementary appendix).\n116. Economic analysis was carried out for the same subprojects as identified for the financial\nanalysis,  and  for  the  same  time  span  assumptions.  For  nontradable  prices,  the  standard\nconversion factor of 0.8 was applied. The economic cost of labor was estimated using an\nappropriate  defined  shadow  rate  for  expensive  family  labor  of  0.85,  which  includes  both\nmanagement and normal labor cost. Economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) were calculated,\nshowing a range from 18 percent (cattle fattening) to 147 percent (taro planting). The EIRRs\ndemonstrate  the  subprojects'  economic  viability.  The  main  EIRR  increases  for  the  retail\nsubproject can be justified on the basis of the large import input costs associated with this\nproject.\n117. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out to test the financial viability of subprojects.\nProject sensitivity was tested on two variables (i) a 10 percent decrease in revenues, (ii) a\nsimilar rate increase in overall costs, and (iii) the potential benefits delayed by one year. The\nthree tested scenarios show that retail, taxi, and cattle fattening subprojects become very\nsensitive to the first two assumptions, but all subprojects subsequently have adverse impacts of\nbenefits and revenues being delayed by one year. The taxi subproject could easily be financially\nunsustainable, and cattle fattening turns out to be economically unacceptable in the third tested\nscenario. All subprojects are more susceptible to changes in revenue than cost increases, which\nare characteristic of rural finance activities.\n2. Venture Capital Fund\n118. The market study estimated some 250 businesses (60 percent of which were identified\nexisting businesses) could take advantage of venture capital investment funds. In a market of\nless than 1,000 commercial-sized businesses, this is a substantial percentage. If businesses are\nnot able to undertake the expansion of which they are capable, then the economy as a whole\nexperiences serious commercial loss. A relatively small outlay on the part of the VCF sponsors\ncould make a significant contribution to closing this investment gap.\n119. Total investment by the VCF over 7-8 years of $1.2 million-$2.7 million (ST5 million-ST8\nmillion), at the normal contribution of sponsor equity and debt, could have a multiplier effect of\ncreating up to $10 million (ST30 million) of new investment over the period. That level of total\ninvestment would be expected to create a substantial number of additional jobs (an estimated\nminimum of 500, likely well in excess of this) vital to an economy where job creation is lagging\nwell behind other growth projections and is a major policy aim for the Samoan Government.\n120. The proposed equity investment in the VCF is a logical extension of the policy dialogue\nconducted under the Financial Sector Program, aimed at liberalizing the financial sector and\nincreasing the range of financial instruments and players. ADB investment will play a catalytic\nrole and attract participation from other multilateral and local financial institutions. It will be also\ndemonstrational, and if successful, will create a model for other PDMCs to follow. Setting up of\nthe VCF coupled with the recent liberalization of the financial sector under the Financial Sector\nProgram will facilitate development of capital markets in Samoa.", "29\n3. Nonquantifiable Benefits\n121. A  substantial  number  of  nonquantifiable  benefits  will  accrue  from  the  Project.  The\ninstitutional strengthening of SBEC and WIBF, along with the establishment of more sustainable\nfunding  arrangements  for  BDS  providers,  will  ensure  improved  access  to  these  services.\nImproving the management skills and instilling a business-like discipline among entrepreneurs\nwill enhance overall success of the business sector. With the anticipated financial and economic\nbenefits generated within the target group, the standard of living will increase.\nB. Social Dimensions\n122. The Project will have a positive social impact on employment and the rural village\neconomies. The most important target group in functional terms to benefit from the Project will\nbe  MSE  entrepreneurs  who  require  additional  finance  to  start,  expand,  or  diversify  their\nenterprises. The results of field surveys are included in a supplementary appendix.\n123. Within the specified target groups, rural households, and in particular the women of\nthese households, residing away from the urban areas, with no direct source of household\nincome  derived  from  regular  wages,  will  be  primary  beneficiaries  from  the  financial  and\nsupplemental technical and business training and advice provided through the Project. Project\ncollaboration with WIBF will directly impact on the economic status of these women and young\npeople as part of the more vulnerable subtarget group.\n124. The Project will also have specific positive benefits for the people of Savai'i by retaining\na portion of the SBLGS specifically for enterprises located on Savai'i. The BDS providers\nselected  for  participation  in  the  Project  have  strong  distribution  mechanisms  to  and\nrepresentation on Savai'i.\n125. The  Government  is  committed  to  achieving  a  more  equitable  spread  of  economic\nbenefits from the liberalization and structural reforms that have already been enacted. These\nreforms  have  created  a  more  enabling  environment  for  entrepreneurial  development.  The\nProject will contribute to the Government objective by improving access of MSE entrepreneurs,\nparticularly in the rural sector, to financial, business training, and business advisory services,\nthus allowing more rural households to develop income-generating activities.\n126. Overall, the Project is expected to contribute to poverty reduction by improving access of\nMSE entrepreneurs to credit, and business development services, thus facilitating income-\ngenerating activities. During the five years of project implementation, without taking into account\nperipheral effects, the Project is expected to directly create an additional 1,400 income and\nemployment opportunities, benefiting 5,600 people.\nC. Impact on Poverty\n127. In general, absolute poverty has not been regarded as a problem in Samoa. GDP per\ncapita is in excess of $1,200. Private remittance flows from Samoans living abroad have been\nsubstantial;  and  the  extended  family  system  has  functioned  as  an  effective  means  of\nredistributing income. Samoa\u2019s human poverty index is the fourth lowest among the PDMCs\nafter  Tonga,  the  Cook  Islands,  and  the  Fiji  Islands.11  The  index  score  of  5.9  reflects  the\nrelatively low percentage of people not expected to survive to the age of 40 (10.3 percent); the\n                                                          \n11UNDP. 1999. Pacific Human Development Report 1999: Creating Opportunities.", "30\nlow illiteracy rate (4.3 percent); the low percentage of people without access to safe water (10\npercent); the fact that all have access to health services; and the relatively high percentage of\nchildren under 5 years of age who are underweight (17 percent). A poverty analysis was\nundertaken as part of the UNDP Poverty Strategies Initiative Project in Samoa.12 Studies were\nconducted to assess food poverty, basic needs poverty, and relative poverty. Using a model diet\nformulated by the Department of Health\u2019s Nutrition Center, the food poverty analysis concluded\nthat 48 percent of households did not have sufficient income to meet their estimated food\nrequirements.  Of  these,  the  majority  were  in  the  rural  areas  of  Savai'i,  and  Upolu,  with\nhouseholds in the urban Apia area faring slightly better. The relative poverty analysis also\nhighlighted the rural areas of Samoa as being most vulnerable to poverty, with Savai'i as the\nregion of most concern. However, the survey data were of questionable value because of\nsampling problems, and the food poverty line was set unusually high. The Government intends\nto conduct another survey in 2001 to provide reliable data for poverty measurement.\n128. Poverty is not mentioned in the SES, and no actions are provided to reduce poverty.\nPoverty is not seen, in the absolute sense, as a critical issue in the Samoan context. At the\nsame time, the concept of relative poverty has applicability. The Government is seeking to\nfacilitate broader based, and thus more inclusive, economic growth by implementing its current\neconomic strategy. High priority is given to improving access to education and health services,\nand to revitalizing the agriculture sector. The Government\u2019s rural development program aims to\nimprove infrastructure (power, transport, and communications) throughout the country, thereby\ncreating opportunities for those living in rural areas.\n129. Sustainable  improvements  in  livelihoods  will  always  be  threatened  by  Samoa\u2019s\nvulnerability to external economic shocks and natural disasters, over which there is virtually no\ncontrol.  Poverty  and  vulnerability  are  linked  as  the  latter  threatens  the  sustainability  of\nlivelihoods.  The  United  Nation\u2019s  Conference  on  Trade  and  Development  has  calculated  a\ncomposite  vulnerability  index  that  placed  Samoa  in  20th  place  among  111  developing\ncountries.13 The Commonwealth vulnerability index ranks Samoa in the group of countries\ncharacterized by high vulnerability.14 Market-based economic diversification may reduce the\nextent  of  aggregate  export  instability,  and  good  economic  management  can  prevent  the\ntranslation of such instability into general macroeconomic instability.\nD. Risks\n130. Risk areas for the project include continuing adherence of the Government to public\nsector reforms and private sector development in the aftermath of the parliamentary elections\nscheduled  for  the  first  half  of  2001.  Given  the  broad  consensus  in  Samoa  regarding  the\neconomic policy, current market-oriented policies are likely to be sustained irrespective of what\nGovernment is in place. At the same time, land-related issues remain sensitive in Samoa, as\nwell as in many other PDMCs. While the Project calls for reforms related to the economic use of\ncustomary  land,  these  issues  are  unlikely  to  be  fully  resolved  within  five  years  of  project\nimplementation.\n                                                          \n12UNDP. 1997. Household Income and Expenditure Survey. Apia.\n13The composite vulnerability index is a weighted aggregate of openness as measured by export dependence,\neconomic diversification as measured by the organization's diversification index, and susceptibility to natural\ndisasters as measured by the proportion of population affected by the disasters during 1970-1996.\n14World Bank. 2000. Small States: Meeting Challenges in the Global Economy. Report of the Commonwealth\nSecretariat/World Bank Joint Task Force on Small States. Washington, DC.", "31\n131. While current macroeconomic conditions are quite stable, underpinned by the robust\nprivate sector growth, and continuing strong remittances from abroad, these conditions could\ndeteriorate,  either  because  of  the  slower  growth  in  exports,  due  to  the  change  in  market\nsituation, or decline in remittances. These risks are considered acceptable given the latest\npositive developments in the economy. Furthermore, Samoa will always be vulnerable to natural\ndisturbances similar to devastation cause by the two major cyclones in 1990 and 1991, and the\nadverse impact of taro leaf blight disease in 1992-1994.\n132. Risks could arise from the weak demand for the SBEC credit guarantee scheme, slow\ntake up of investments by the VCF, and unforeseen weakening of institutional capacities of the\nIAs.  These  risks  are  considered  acceptable  due  to  the  recent  record  of  the  SBEC  credit\nguarantee scheme, and demand assessments conducted during the feasibility study for the\nVCF. Continuing strong growth of Samoa\u2019s economy will underpin the demand. Furthermore,\nthe Project will include mitigating measures directed at institutional strengthening of the IAs.\n133. The key country risk for external investors appears to be acceptable in view of the stable\npolitical environment and the fiscally responsible stance of the Samoan Government. The prime\nmarket risk is the small market size, and the relatively undeveloped secondary industry sector.\nFurther risk arises from the importance of expatriate remittances and aid agencies\u2019 contributions\nto the Samoan gross national product (10-20 percent each). However, both contributions have\nbeen stable over time. Clear independence from Government intervention is also a desirable\nstate,  especially  if  Government  institutions  are  represented  among  the  shareholders  and\ndirectors.  Investee  risk  in  small-scale  businesses  is  largely  within  the  management  of  the\nbusiness, i.e., the management is the risk. The main mitigating factors will be the objectivity,\ncompetence, and analytical skills of VCF management and staff, and tight investment criteria to\neliminate the higher risk applicants. Liquidity should be adequate if the shareholders set up and\nfund the VCF as proposed.\n134. There is a risk that while preparatory work is being done, and IFC has confirmed its\ncontinued interest in the VCF, the VCF may not materialize. The structure and shareholding\ncould change in the process of preparatory work. The current indication is that IFC, which does\nnot need board approval for the investment of the proposed magnitude, will make a decision\nbefore the end of 2000. Risks will be mitigated by the fact that any actual ADB investment in the\nVCF  is  contingent  on  IFC  participation,  as  the  lead  investor.  ADB  will  continue  close\nconsultations with SPPF and IFC on VCF structure and shareholding.\n135. The participating organizations, particularly at the grassroots level, have very limited\ncapacity to support additional demands that could arise as a result of this Project. Unless the\ninstitutional strengthening components result in improved capacity and sustainability of the\nparticipating organizations, the implementation of all programs proposed for the Project could\nactually weaken them. Grassroot organizations are particularly susceptible to staff turnover\nbecause of low staff numbers.

Background\n1. The financial system of Samoa comprises the Central Bank of Samoa (CBS), three\nprivate commercial banks (two foreign-owned and one locally owned), and six nonbank financial\ninstitutions  (NBFIs).  Under  the  Financial  Institutions  Act  of  1996,  CBS  performs  a  normal\nprudential regulation role (including on-site inspection of the three locally commercial banks,\nwhich are all locally incorporated; is responsible for conducting monetary and exchange rate\npolicy;  and  manages  part  of  the  country\u2019s  foreign  exchange  reserves.  Under  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank's (ADB) Financial Sector Program loan (FSPL), CBS is being strengthened.\nImprovements are taking place in management information and accounting systems and CBS\u2019s\nbudgetary reporting is being strengthened to support key responsibilities and provide greater\ntransparency. Public sector management reforms, including a corporate plan and performance\nand output-based budgeting are key initiatives for CBS over the next two years.\nB. Legal and Regulatory Environment\n2. Monitoring and supervision takes place in the Financial Institutions Department of CBS;\nsupervision is currently confined to the commercial banks. The prudential guidelines issued in\nMarch 1996 by CBS are consistent with the Financial Institutions Act 1996 and with standards\nadopted worldwide. Compliance with these guidelines is being monitored by CBS. CBS is also\nstrengthening monitoring of bank compliance with these guidelines with assistance from ADB\ntechnical assistance (TA). Compliance with core principles agreed by the Basle Committee of\nSupervisors  (BIS)  is  also  satisfactory.  The  capital  adequacy  ratio  (CAR)  as  a  minimum\npercentage of risk-weighted assets and other exposures has been set at no less than 15\npercent. Tier 1 capital can be no less than 7.5 percent while tier II capital cannot exceed 100\npercent of tier 1 capital.\n3. Commercial banks are subject to a system of detailed regular reporting with reports\nanalyzed  in  relation  to  prudential  standards  as  detailed  above.  The  two  foreign-owned\ncommercial banks exceed the minimum while the locally owned National Bank of Samoa (NBS)\nhas  a  capital  ratio  of  about  the  minimum.  The  net  open  position  of  banks  is  now  fully\nimplemented with prudential procedures and data monitored on a weekly basis. The prudential\nstatement on provisioning increasing general provisions from 1 to 2 percent is proceeding.\nBanks are also permitted to lend an equivalent of no more than 25 percent of capital to any one\nborrower.\n4. The NBFIs are not subject to prudential guidelines at present. The FSPL calls for CBS to\nextend its prudential supervision to nonbank financial institutions to better protect the stability of\nthe financial system (requiring amending the legislation). These institutions engaged in banking\nactivities should be subject to the same supervisory and prudential framework as banks, so as\nto ensure a level playing field. Although agreement in principle has been reached to having the\nDevelopment Bank of Samoa (DBS) and the National Provident Fund (NPF) report to CBS\nunder its prudential supervision requirements, the necessary statutory changes are still awaited\nfor the Financial Institutions Act.\n5. CBS is being reorganized so that departmental responsibilities are more focused to a\nliberalized  financial  system.  As  part  of  this,  procedures  in  CBS  are  being  strengthened,\nincluding  supervision  procedures  and  strengthening  prudential  matters  including  liquidity\nrequirements are being considered by the Financial Institutions Department. The capacity of", "44\nAppendix 2, page 2\nCBS to conduct banking supervision is currently being enhanced through technical assistance\n(TA) provided by the FSPL. Nevertheless the Financial Institutions Department is small, the\naverage length of experience of its staff is short, and ongoing staff training is needed.\nC. Commercial Banks\n6. The assets of the commercial banks comprised 42.4 percent of the ST703 million total\nassets compared with the 40.5 percent share of the nonbank financial institutions as of June\n1999 (Table A2.1). There are three privately owned commercial banks, namely, the ANZ Bank\n(Samoa) Ltd (ANZ); Pacific Commercial Bank Ltd (PCB), which is jointly owned by Westpac\nBanking Corporation and Bank of Hawaii; and NBS, which is locally owned by private sources.\nTheir shares in total assets of commercial banks were 62.8 percent, 28.7 percent, and 8.5\npercent respectively as of June 1999.\nTable A2.1: Total Assets or Liabilities of Major Financial Institutions, 1994-1999\n(in percentage of total assets/liabilities)\n Institutions 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999a\nTreasury 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.3\nCentral Bank of Samoa 21.1 20.9 21.2 20.7 18.8 16.7\nCommercial Banks 36.5 37.4 38.8 40.8 40.4 42.4\n  Australia New Zealand Bank Ltd 27.1 25.6 26.5 28.5 26.5 26.7\n  Pacific Commercial Bank Ltd 9.3 10.8 10.3 9.7 10.4 12.2\n  National Bank of Samoab 0.0 0.9 2.0 2.6 3.5 3.6\n   \nNonbank Financial Institutions 41.9 41.0 39.6 38.1 40.4 40.5\n  National Provident Fund 21.5 21.4 21.3 21.6 23.2 23.5\n  Development Bank of Samoa 10.5 10.0 9.3 7.8 8.1 8.2\n  National Pacific Insurance Ltd 3.1 3.1 2.6 2.4 2.8 2.6\n  Samoa Life Assurance Corp. 3.1 3.3 3.2 3.1 3.2 3.2\n  Public Trust Office 1.4 1.4 1.3 1.3 1.2 1.2\n  Housing Corporation 1.8 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.9 1.8\nSource: Central Bank of Samoa. 1999. Bulletin, September. Apia.\na As of June 1999.\nb National Bank of Samoa came into operation in December 1995.\n7. The smallness of the Samoan economy has led to an oligopolistic commercial banking\nsubsector; the largest bank, ANZ, which held 63 percent of total bank assets as of June 1999\ncould be assumed to play the role of market leader. However, ANZ\u2019s market share has fallen\nfrom 74 percent in 1994 indicating that there is some competitiveness in the system and the\nshares of both PCB and NBS have risen over that period. The size of total assets of the\ncommercial banks largely reflects the length of time each bank has been in existence. ANZ\nopened in 1959 and became a wholly owned subsidiary of the ANZ Banking Group Ltd after the\nGovernment relinquished its 25 percent shareholding in 1995. PCB commenced operations in\n1987 as an entirely private bank, with Westpac Banking Corporation and the Bank of Hawaii\neach holding 43 percent equity stake and private domestic interests holding the remaining 14\npercent. NBS commenced operation in December 1995 when the Government disposed of its\nentire shareholding in the former Post Office Savings Bank to local interests. The two foreign\nbanks are mostly involved in trade financing, term financing, and letters of credit; almost all\nlending in Samoa is asset backed.", "45\nAppendix 2, page 3\n8. ANZ has a full branch in Apia, four bank-staffed agencies, one foreign exchange airport\nagency, and two mobile vans. PCB has a head office, one bank-staffed agency and two foreign\nexchange airport agencies. NBS has a head office, five bank-staffed agencies, and one foreign\nexchange airport agency. As in most other Pacific developing member countries, the urban\nareas are provided with much better banking facilities than the rural areas1 where there is less\nbanking access to banking facilities or services. In 1999, there was one branch or agency for\nevery 10,500 people (as measured by the ratio of population to bank branches or agencies).\n9. The state-owned NBFIs, the National Provident Fund (NPF), DBS, Housing Corporation\nof Samoa (HCS), Samoa Life Insurance (SLI), and Public Trust Office (PTO) dominate the\nnonbank financial sector\u2019s assets, which accounted for 93.76 percent of the total nonbank\nfinancial sector\u2019s assets as of June 1999. NPF, the largest NBFI, holds 23.5 percent of the total\nassets of the financial system, almost as much as the share of ANZ. NPF is a compulsory\nretirement scheme covering all paid employees in Samoa. DBS accounts for 8.2 percent of total\nassets of the financial system. DBS does not take deposits and is solely funded by Government\nequity and lines of credit provided by international development agencies. The major insurance\nproviders  are  the  Samoan  Life  Assurance  Corporation  and  the  National  Pacific  Insurance\nLimited, in which the Government has a 30 percent equity stake. The Housing Corporation of\nSamoa provides small housing finance but is a small player in the financial system with less\nthan a 2 percent share.\n10. Commercial banks accounted for 50.8 percent of credit to the private sector in June\n1999  compared  with  49.2  percent  provided  by  NBFIs.  The  share  of  credit  provided  by\ncommercial banks to the private sector has increased since the financial sector was liberalized.\nBanks and nonbanks have minimal claims on the Government and state-owned enterprises.\nThe informal credit market in Samoa is very small. Money transfers are also available, the\nbiggest providers being Xpresstrac, Western Union, and four foreign exchange dealers were\napproved by CBS in October 1999. Credit unions are an established part of the financial\nsystem, and provided by solicitors and moneylenders provide small amounts of credit in the\ninformal market.\n11. The market for deposits is dominated by the commercial banks particularly after the\nestablishment of NBS, which took over the Post Office Savings Bank. The deposit structure\nwithin the banking system in 1999 reflected the interest rate structure; around 27 percent of\nfunds were held in short-term deposits (less than 3 months); almost 48 percent of funds were\nheld in deposits with maturities of between 3 and 12 months; 25 percent were held in deposits\nwith maturities of 12 to 24 months, and little or no funds were held in maturities beyond 24\nmonths. This reflected the fact that interest rates remained at 7.5 percent for both 12- and 24-\ndeposits month.\n12. Commercial bank lending is focused on building, construction, and the purchase of land,\ntogether with manufacturing and trade. These sectors make up nearly 77 percent of total\ncommercial bank lending. Whereas nonbanks, primarily DBS and NPF, are the main lenders to\nthe primary industry sector. At present nearly 15 percent of their lending goes to the agriculture\nsector as compared with commercial banks with only 1 percent of their lending. These figures\nare based on tala amounts, if the number of loans are considered, the percentage would be\nmuch higher, particularly for DBS.\n                                                          \n1 There are two automated teller machines in downtown Apia and most banking outlets are in the urban areas.", "46\nAppendix 2, page 4\nTable A2.2: Financial Intermediation Statistics, 1994-1999\n Items 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999\n  (ST million)\nMoney Supply (M2) 138.1 168.2 176.8 200.2 210.2 214.8\n Narrow Money (M1) 47.20 60.94 61.14 69.02 66.53 68.07\n Currency Outside Banks 16.82 21.60 20.96 24.88 24.82 19.41\n Demand Deposits 30.38 39.34 40.18 44.14 41.71 48.66\n Quasi Money 90.88 107.30 115.69 131.17 143.67 146.70\n Savings Deposits 18.64 26.02 29.80 28.73 30.38 33.01\n Time Deposits 72.24 81.28 85.89 102.44 113.29 113.69\n(in percent)\n Growth of Demand Deposits 0.0 29.5 2.1 9.9 (5.5) 16.7\n Growth of Time Deposits 0.0 12.5 5.7 19.3 10.6 0.4\n Growth in Private Sector Credit (2.2) 30.4 18.2 17.5 18.8 37.3\n  (in percent of GDP)\n Currency in percent of GDP 3.6 4.5 4.0 4.1 3.9 2.8\n Demand & Time Deposits in percent of GDP 21.8 25.3 23.8 24.2 24.1 23.6\n Narrow Money in percent of GDP 10.0 12.8 11.6 11.4 10.3 9.9\n Broad Money in percent of GDP 29.3 35.3 33.4 33.1 32.6 31.3\n  (in percent)\n Private Sector Credit (percent of GDP) 16.3 21.0 22.4 23.0 25.7 26.1\n Private Sector Credit (percent of M2) 55.7 59.6 67.1 69.6 78.7 83.4\n Private Sector Credit (percent of total credit) 191.3 160.5 178.8 212.8 264.6 210.2\n   \n Currency (per cent of broad money) 12.2 12.8 11.9 12.4 11.8 9.0\n Narrow Money (percent of broad money) 34.2 36.2 34.6 34.5 31.7 31.7\n Quasi Money (percent of broad money) 65.8 63.8 65.4 65.5 68.3 68.3\n Demand Deposits (percent of narrow money) 64.4 64.6 65.7 64.0 62.7 71.5\n Total Domestic Credit/Banking Assets 38.6 56.0 53.7 49.3 48.5 72.6\n   \n Currency in circulation per capita 4.1 5.0 5.0 5.2 4.7  \nSource: Central Bank of Samoa. 1999.

The improvements in financial deepening in Samoa can be attributed largely to the\nfinancial sector reforms, which the authorities are putting into place under the FSPL, which\nliberalized  interest  rates,  replaced  direct  instruments  of  monetary  control  with  indirect\ninstruments,  promoted  money  and  foreign  exchange  markets,  strengthened  CBS  and  its\noperational autonomy, strengthened the prudential and regulatory framework, and strengthened\nNPF and DBS.\n14. From 1 January 1998, interest rates on both deposits and lending were liberalized;\ncommercial banks are now free to set their own interest rates; credit growth is controlled\nthrough open market operations of central bank instruments. Prior to 1998, maximum rates on\nloans and overdrafts were set at 12 percent, minimum savings rates at 3 percent, and the\nminimum rate on 1 month to 2-year term deposits ranged from 4.5 to 7.5 percent. Since the\nliberalization, interest rates have not fluctuated significantly, with lending rates averaging around\n12.7 percent and deposit rates 5 percent (from January 1998 to June 1999). Spreads to date\nhave not fallen significantly reflecting the lack of competition and significant liquidity in the", "47\nAppendix 2, page 5\ncommercial  banking  system.  Following  the  removal  of  interest  rate  controls,  quasi  money\nincreased 9.5 percent in 1998 reflecting an increase in time deposits.\n15. Excess liquidity, which was a feature of the banking system, has declined with financial\nsector reforms. The gap between broad money, in percent of the gross domestic product\n(GDP), which shows the amount of liquidity available and private credit in percent of GDP,\nprovides a rough indication in Samoa of the excess liquidity in the system. This measurement\nhas fallen from 13 percent in 1994 to just under 7 percent in 1998 and an estimated 5 percent in\n1999,  indicating  that  excess  liquidity  has  declined  considerably  over  that  period.  However\nliquidity in the market is affected by the actions of both NPF and ACS. ACS has recently\nconstructed a new building and has built up large term deposits in the banking system. Now it is\npaying builders, it is withdrawing these deposits, and much of the funds are going overseas.\nD. Nonbank Financial Institutions\n1.  National Provident Fund\n16. NPF was established under the NPF Act of 1972. The act does not include specific\nguidelinesm, but places NPF board in the position of trustee. The board has interpreted this to\nmean that they should be ultra cautious in their investments. Their major investment areas are\n(i) property loans (residential and commercial); (ii) members loans (e.g., housing, school fees);\nand (iii) freehold property loans. However in December 1998, several amendments to the NPF\nAct were passed by Parliament, including: (i) that members\u2019 interests are to be paramount in the\nadministration of the fund; (ii) the fund can now invest up to 10 percent of its investment funds\noverseas, and invest for terms longer than 12 months without prior approval of the minister of\nfinance;  and  (iii)  an  amendment  to  allow  members  to  withdraw  their  account  balance  at\nretirement in one lump sum from age 55, as well as allowing withdrawal prior to this age under\ncertain circumstances.\n17. NPF has about 25,000 active members (members who have made a contribution in the\nlast 30 days) out of a potential workforce of 50,000-60,000. Members and their employers\ncontribute 5 percent of salary. At age 55, members can take either a lump sum or a pension.\nUntil December 1998 they could only take a pension. Now virtually everybody takes the lump\nsum. The reason for offering a lump sum was (i) the pension was very small as most members\nhad balances between ST10-ST30,000, and (ii) the members wanted a lump sum to start a\nsmall business; however there is no evidence that the lump sum is being used for this purpose.\n18. Less than 5 percent of NPF\u2019s investments are in equity. This is so small because there\nis no secondary market and no price transparency. NPF currently has investments in two\ncompanies, both of which were recommended by South Pacific Project Facility (SPPF). At\npresent,  equity  investment  in  NPF,  are  essentially  locked  in.  As  of  December  1997,\ncontributions to the fund stood at ST107 million, with a growth over the previous year of some\nST11 million. Although NPF recently obtained permission to invest up to 10 percent of its\nportfolio overseas, no foreign investments have been made. ANZ has been trying to set up a\nregional meeting in Melbourne so that provident funds in the region can work together to\nestablish an overseas fund.\n19. The strengthening of NPF has been part of financial sector reforms in Samoa. As part of\nthese reforms, NPF has undertaken a major reorganization and continued its strong growth, a\ncorporate plan has been developed, and an actuarial review is now ongoing. NPF has moved to\nimplement a market-based interest rate policy for loans to its members. Prior to the reforms", "48\nAppendix 2, page 6\nNPF charged 9 percent for all loans regardless of risk; it has now adopted a base rate of 10.5\npercent  with  risk-weighted  margins  of  up  to  6  percent;  a  matrix  of  risk  factors  has  been\ndeveloped together with guidelines for their application. The average interest rate for NPF loans\nis now between 12 to 13 percent per annum, and is comparable with rates being charged in\nother financial institutions.\n2. Development Bank of Samoa\n20. Since its establishment in 1974, DBS has relied almost exclusively on soft loans from aid\nagencies such as ADB, and the European Investment Bank (EIB), together with funding from\nthe  Government  of  Samoa  as  its  main  sources  of  capital  and  finance.  In  general  this  is\nconsistent with how all development banks throughout the region have raised capital. Farmers,\nfisherfolk, and business people in the rural areas have very limited access to credit and banking\nservices. Often they depend on informal sources of credit at high cost. Rural borrowers are\nhampered by lack of collateral, little or no equity, very few business skills, and inadequacies in\nproject ideas. Private commercial banks do not have branches in the rural areas and their\nlending to rural-based borrowers is minimal\u2014approximately 1 percent of their lending according\nto the most recent CBS figures. In this environment, DBS has played a crucial role in assisting\nborrowers in these areas in the development of their businesses.\n21. Agriculture has been the major focus of lending for DBS in both 1997 and 1998, and it is\nexpected to remain a major focus of DBS lending. Within this sector, fishing has been the major\ngrowth area. Fisheries has enjoyed very buoyant times in recent years and DBS has had major\nexposure to the industry, with the growth of new entrants impressive. However, many may not\nsurvive due to the stricter licensing requirements recently brought down by Government.\n22. Under the reform program, DBS moved to a policy of fully market-based interest rates in\nJanuary 1998. It has eliminated the concessionary rates for agriculture (formerly 8 percent per\nannum), and has established a risk matrix and guidelines for assigning risk weightings to\ninterest rates, with a base rate of 10.5 percent and a range of up to 13.5 percent. Average rates\nare now equivalent to open market rates and have been budgeted between 12 and 13 percent.\nIn addition, small loans have been more appropriately priced by adopting flat rates of 10 percent\nminimum for this class of loan (equivalent to around 18 percent per annum) to reflect the high\nappraisal and administrative cost of the loans.\n23. DBS has performed consistently over the last few years. With various ADB TA, DBS has\naddressed most of its key operational areas.\n24. DBS's strategic plan was approved by its board in December 1998. The plan's major\nfocus to streamline loan-processing procedures and strengthen the recovery of bad loans by\nestablishing a loan recovery unit. DBS has also made significant progress international best\npractice of its credit policies and procedures, and has established board-approved credit policy\nguidelines.  The  identification  and  establishment  of  a  range  of  performance  indicators  has\nprovided management and the board with the means of monitoring performance in the critical\nareas of DBS operations. The performance indicators and targets over the planning period\nreflected in the financial and other objectives were developed as part of the corporate plan and\ntaking into account other development banks in the region as well as attempting some best\npractice principles.\nE. Microfinance", "49\nAppendix 2, page 7\n1. Demand for Microfinance in Samoa\n25. The  growth  in  demand  for  microfinance  services,  especially  for  informal  financial\nservices is an indication of the unmet demand for financial services, especially by low-income\nhouseholds and people in rural areas who have limited access to formal financial services.\nDemand for microfinance services is increasing in Samoa as a result of vulnerability to poverty,\nunemployment and the burgeoning informal sector, and lack of access by the poor to formal\nfinancial services.\n26. In Samoa, as in many countries in the Pacific, poverty remains a sensitive issue. It is\nbelieved that one never goes without in Samoa because of the fa\u2019asamoa, which is a kind of a\nsafety net that protects and provides for all members of an extended network of family and\nfriends. However, this support system is now being threatened by the transition from traditional\nto modern society. Evidence indicates that social systems are being undermined in these\ntransitional times as seen by increased crime rates, rising incidence of family disputes and\nmarriage breakups, and emergence of relative poverty. The 1998 Samoa household income\nand expenditure survey found that one in three households could not properly meet their basic\nneeds and, therefore, were poor relative to standards of living in Samoa.\n27. Unemployment is on the rise in Samoa. Private sector employment has been in decline\nfalling by 0.56 percent and 1.26 percent in 1997 and 1998 respectively (Data from National\nProvident Fund). The situation in not likely to improve over the foreseeable future. The waged\nsector will not expand at a sufficient rate to provide jobs to meet present demands of the more\nthan 4,000 annual school leavers, and those that will be affected by reforms in the public sector.\nThe people in informal employment increased from 27,400 in 1986 to 29,000 in 1991; while\nthose working in the formal sector were 45,500 in 1986 increasing to 47,900 in 1991. Estimates\nare that the urban informal market has grown by around 10 percent annually, and involves 500-\n600 households. Women, in particularly, are more actively involved in informal sector activities\nto  augment  the  family  income.  Approximately  90  percent  of  women  traders  at  the  food,\nhandicraft, and flea markets are women.\n2. Supply of Microfinance\n28. The  few  providers  of  microfinance  services  in  Samoa  include  nongovernment\norganizations (NGOs), credit unions, DBS, or commercial banks. Only one NGO, the Women in\nBusiness Foundation (WIBF), is involved in microfinance; it is implementing a microfinance\nscheme with funding provided by UNDP but on a very limited scale. Other NGOs have already\nsignified interest in microfinance, but there is no legal framework allowing NGOs to engage in\nmicrofinance. The current laws are silent on whether NGOs can provide credit and accept\nsavings. NGOs, including WIBF, need institutional strengthening, in terms of TA and training, to\nbe able to effectively expand their outreach and to achieve operational self-sufficiency in the\ndistant future.\n29. The longstanding providers of microfinance services in Samoa are the credit unions who\noffer both savings facilities and credit. Credit unions have provided substantial loans to their\nmembers and have mobilized a significant amount of savings from members; some of them\nearn  income  from  their  operations,  especially  those  whose  office  bearers  are  extending\nvoluntary services, because of the very low operational costs.\n30. The DBS also provides small loans but its loans are subject to the usual lending polices\nof the DBS making it difficult for low-income people to have access to their loans. Commercial", "50\nAppendix 2, page 8\nbanks  and  finance  companies  also  provide  financial  services  but  cater  to  those  gainfully\nemployed or with regular sources of income. Some of the requirements and the relatively high\namount of the loan make it difficult for microentrepreneurs and low-income households to have\naccess to their services. Their services are also quite expensive considering the various fees\ncharged to clients.\n31. Substantial financial transactions (credit and savings) are likely flowing in the informal\nfinancial  system  in  Samoa.  However  the  savings  and  loans  are  mainly  used  for  meeting\ntraditional and family obligations and rarely utilized for productive purposes or enterprises. The\nsources of credit and savings for the marginal sector of society come from the informal financial\nsystem, semiformal financial system, and formal financial system.", "51\nAppendix 3, page 1\nSMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT FUND\nA. Objective\n1.  The objective of the Small Business Development Fund (SBDF) is to provide sustainable\nfunding for business development activities directed at the micro- and small-enterprise (MSE)\nsector, with an emphasis on rural enterprises. The SBDF will be used to purchase business\ntraining, advisory, and monitoring services from accredited business service providers working\nclosely with the target groups, in support of other project components. Accredited business\nservice providers are initially identified as the Women in Business Foundation (WIBF) and the\nSmall  Business  Enterprise  Centre  (SBEC).  SBEC  will  be  responsible  for  confirming\naccreditation of other potential participating organizations.\nB. Funding Base\n2.  The SBDF will be financed initially through a $0.8 million grant to be made from the\nAsian Development Bank loan account. The potential exists for any balance remaining in the\nSBDF to be converted to a trust fund toward the end of the five-year project lifespan. Initial\nexpressions of interest in this regard came from the New Zealand Overseas Development\nAssistance (NZODA) and the Government of Samoa.\nC. Structure\n3.  The SBDF will be held in a specially designated escrow account with the Central Bank of\nSamoa (CBS). The SBDF will be managed by a subcommittee of the project steering committee\n(PSC), comprising one representative each from the Treasury Department, the Department of\nTrade, Commerce, and Industry (DTCI); and the Development Bank of Samoa (DBS). It is\nproposed that the financial secretary or nominee, on behalf of the Government and the Treasury\nDepartment,  chair  the  subcommittee.  Other  development  partners  interests  could  be\nrepresented on the subcommittee if necessary. Details of the main workings of the SBDF will be\ndocumented in a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Treasury Department and\nCBS, the MOU to be in form and content acceptable to ADB.\n4.  Participating organizations and implementing agencies who are likely to benefit from the\nSBDF will be excluded from serving on the subcommittee to avoid any conflict of interest.\nD. Functions\n5.  The  functions  of  the  subcommittee  will  include  (i)  operation,  supervision  and\nmanagement of the SBDF, (ii) investment and distribution of the SBDF resources, and (iii)\nauthorization and conclusion of agreements on behalf of the PSC. The subcommittee will meet\nat  least  biannually  to  consider  work  plans  and  funding  requests  from  accredited  service\nproviders,  and  quarterly  to  receive  monitoring  reports  and  approve  quarterly  advances  to\nparticipating organizations.\nE. Income\n6.  Under the Project it is envisioned that the SBDF will be annually replenished by the\nGovernment from its budget, and by ADB loan proceeds to the amounts specified in Table A4.2.", "52\nAppendix 3, page 2\nF. Distribution of Income\n7.  SBEC and WIBF are to be invited to submit fully costed and detailed medium-term work\nplans  annually  for  funding  consideration.  Proposals  must  demonstrate  how  the  funding  of\nactivities will enhance the prospects for achieving the project goal of increasing income and\nemployment in the MSE sector, emphasizing the rural sector. The SBDF will initially support\nWIBF and SBEC, but could expand its support to other participating organizations as they\nbecome accredited.\n8.  Proposals must demonstrate a clear separation between the activities currently funded\nunder other aid activities, and those proposed to be funded under the SBDF.\n9.  Proposals must demonstrate a clear demand for the proposed activities. While the\nproposals will likely not be fully funded through the SBDF, a portion of the total cost will be paid\nfor either through a contribution from the participating organizations, or through the charging of\na levy on the target group.\n10.  Proposals will be considered on a competitive bid basis, and the SBDF can accept or\nreject any or all proposals. The decision of the subcommittee will be final.\n11.  Work plans must include detailed performance measures, which will form the basis of a\ncontract between the SBDF and the participating organization concerned. Contracts will be on a\nfixed fee basis, and clearly linked to outputs.\n12.  Adequate monitoring mechanisms and systems must be put in place by the participating\norganizations to provide an audit trail and monitoring of the activities, outputs, and impact of\nprograms funded out of the SBDF.\n13.  In  recognition  of  the  funding  constraints  experienced  by  participating  organizations,\nquarterly advance payments may be made against the contract to the commonly participating\norganization concerned. The payment of quarterly advances will be conditional on achieving the\nmilestones agreed to for the prior quarter, and will be based both on project performance and\nfinancial audits.\nG. Operation and Administration\n14.  The project monitoring unit (PMU) will provide administration support for the SBDF, in a\nmanner acceptable to ADB. Administration would consist of maintaining the books of account,\nmaintaining the bank accounts, evaluating and summarizing proposals for consideration by the\nsub-committee,  receiving  income,  negotiating  contracts,  making  payments,  and  preparing\nfinancial and other operational statements.\n15.  Monitoring the activities of the participating organizations contracted to deliver services\nwill be undertaken by the PMU, with summary reports presented to the subcommittee of the\nPSC on a quarterly basis. Progress reports by the POs will form part of the contract agreed to\nby the parties.", "53\nAppendix 3, page 3\nH. Audit\n16.  A reputable auditing company, domiciled in Samoa, will audit the SBDF on an annual\nbasis. Major responsibilities of the auditors will include confirmation that the investments are\nheld in the designated bank account, that all income has been received, that all payments have\nbeen properly authorized and recorded, that bank accounts have been verified, and that all\nfinancial information presented to the subcommittee is accurate.", "54\nAppendix 4, page 1\nSAMOA VENTURE CAPITAL FUND\nA. Background\n1. The proposal for a venture capital facility (VCF) in Samoa arose as a result of the South\nPacific Project Facility (SPPF) aid review undertaken in November 1998 of the International\nFinance Corporation (IFC)/Admiralty Study on Pacific Islands Financing Needs 1998. The study\nidentified some generally available VCFs in the region from sources including Pacific Island\nInvestment Facility (PIIF) (IFC), and the Papua New Guinea/Fiji Islands based Kula Fund.\nHowever, the former has a minimum investment limit of $100,000, and the latter also supports\nlarger projects and had until recently confined itself to Melanesia. Other funding sources such\nas New Zealand\u2019s Pacific Island Investment Development Scheme (PIIDS) have constraints\nrelating to participation by aid country nationals.\n2. A  clear  gap  exists  for  financing  below  ST300,000  for  locally  based  projects.  In\nconsultation with SPPF, the Government of Samoa expressed a keen interest in piloting a VCF\nthat operates in this lower range. As a result, an indicative feasibility study was commissioned\nby SPPF (Review of Feasibility) and extensive market research completed. The final step in the\nprocess was the development of an investment memorandum for submission to the proposed\nsubscribers: (i) IFC; (ii) Asian Development Bank (ADB), (iii) Australia New Zealand Bank\n(ANZ), (iv) Development Bank of Samoa (DBS), and (v) Samoa National Provident Fund (NPF).\nB. Structure of Facility and Return on Investment\n3. The recommended structure is a 100 percent equity financed facility, investing by way of\na range of equity and quasi-equity instruments with the preferred instrument being venture\ncapital loans. The internal rate of return (IRR) for this structure is 8.6 percent, which is below is\nexpected  in  more  mature  markets,  but  this  is  partly  attributable  to  (i)  very  conservative\nassumptions about the earnings of the typical investee company, (ii) delayed returns while the\ninvestee overcomes initial losses, and (iii) high provisions for losses on equity investments.\nLogically, a true VCF is preferably financed from equity. For Samoa, the proposed VCF will fund\nexpansion projects, at a somewhat lower risk than true venture capital, and therefore some level\nof gearing is acceptable and lower loan losses are more realistic.\n4. With VCF investments likely to be primarily in established businesses, projected loan\nlosses should be significantly less than might be the case with mainly seed capital or true\nventure investments. However, for the purpose of the model, a very conservative 25 percent\nloan loss provision has been allowed for on the outstanding portfolio. This produces revenue\nlosses from year 1, which may be too conservative an assumption when calculating the IRR, but\nis a prudent safety factor. A typical investee company forecast has been prepared based on a\nconservative, agricultural model, paying interest at 20 percent per annum on its venture capital\nloan.\nC. The Facility and its Management\n1. Investment and Shareholder Contributions\n5. The proposal is for the VCF to invest $240,000 annually for 7 years, using total funding\nof  $1,600,000  from  shareholders  plus  retained  earnings.  The  primary  shareholders  are", "55\nAppendix 4, page 2\nassumed to be IFC, ADB, DBS, NPF, and ANZ, with the contributions from DBS and NPF at\n12.5 percent each, ADB at 25 percent, IFC at 40 percent, and ANZ 10 percent.\nTable A4.1: Shareholders\u2019 Subscriptions\nTotal Subscription\nPayment $'000\nImmediate 480\nYear 3 320\nYear 5 320\nYear 6 480\nTotal 1,600\n2. Corporate Structure\n6. Revisions to the original base case for the Project are being developed to better reflect\nbest practice. A two-tier structure of two legal entities is proposed: the fund (VCF) and a funds\nmanagement company (FMC). An FMC is being formed in Samoa and is being structured in line\nwith other management companies operating small funds elsewhere in the world, under IFC\nsupervision. In addition to this and in line with IFC policy on skills/technology transfer and\ncapacity building in-country, this FMC is being established with the view to it becoming a stand-\nalone facility in the long term and as a vehicle to attract local Samoan investors to supplant the\noriginal shareholders over time.\n7. The FMC will be a special purpose vehicle nominally capitalized by the investors and\nsubsidized by assistance agencies, that will operate under a management contract for the VCF.\nThe VCF board members will be appointed pro rata to shareholding, with ordinary shares\ncarrying preemptive rights to enable primary sponsors to maintain control of shareholding in the\nearly years. Management to be described in Table A4.2.\nTable A4.2: Proposed Corporate Structure\nEntity Role and Function\nThe Board Policy, corporate governance, major decisions\nCredit Committee Credit decisions within policy, advisory role to FMC\nFMC Fund management\nFMC = funds management company.\n8. The credit committee will comprise two local board members or alternates, together with\nthe chief executive officer, an international expert, will be engaged as chief executive officer.\nSupport staff in the FMC will be three business analysts and an administrative secretary. Two of\nthe analysts are to be seconded for one to two years from DBS and the NPF to learn best\npractice equity and quasi-equity investment and transfer those skills back to their organizations.\n3. Target Market\n9. The target market for the VCF is venture capital investments of less than ST300,000.\nRecommended limits are ST50,000-ST250,000 with an upper limit of 50 percent of the total\nequity (including the VCF contribution) for existing businesses and 40 percent for new ventures.\nProject size is therefore expected to range from roughly ST200,000-ST1,200,000 with between", "56\nAppendix 4, page 3\n70 to 80 percent likely to be expansion and diversification projects. The investment focus will be\non projects that contribute to economic growth and, in particular, earn or save foreign exchange.\n4. Investment Instrument\n10. The preferred investment instrument will be straight debt instruments\u2014venture capital\nloans\u2014because  of  the  relatively  small  size  of  the  investments,  and  the  cost  of  putting\ninvestments in place and simplifying exit options. It will therefore be unsecured subordinated\ndebt, a normal loan instrument but without collateral security and documented to rank (or be\nsubordinated) behind other debt. While this is the preferred simple instrument, the VCF will be\nable to use all other normally accepted equity and quasi-equity instruments subject to well-\ndocumented criteria. A financial model has been based on the venture loan option as it is\nanticipated this will be instrument used in the majority of cases.\n5. Interest on VC Loans\n11. The original base case recommended interest to be 20 percent per annum on venture\ncapital loans to reflect the risk involved in unsecured investments. Commercial interest rates\nhave been dropping in Samoa, and the base will be adjusted to better reflect the market.  Other\nincome will be earned from application and establishment fees, each 1 percent of the amount\ninvested.\n6. Life of the Facility\n12. Some of the investments will still be maturing in years 10-15, and therefore the life of the\nVCF will need to be 10 years or more.\n7. Exit Options\n13. Exit options for VCF investments are likely to primarily involve existing shareholders,\ntogether with their families and associates. Commercial financiers will provide take-out where\nthe specific business matures and becomes bankable under conventional criteria. Public issues\nare a remote prospect. The proposed base case venture capital loan structure will make it\nsimple for exit to take place at any time, as the take-out will only need to cover loan principal\nand accrued interest, and no equity valuation issues will be involved.\n8. External Support for Operating Costs\n14. The original base case assumes that the aid agencies will meet the cost of the chief\nexecutive officer's remuneration package, and other cash operating costs, for the first three\nyears, and the officer's package thereafter. Another model shows that the portfolio size will need\nto roughly double, to $3.3 million, to produce comparable returns should all costs be borne by\nthe VCF. Projections for first-year operating costs, based on a stand-alone office, are presented\nin Table A4.3.", "57\nAppendix 4, page 4\nTable A4.3: First Year Operating Costs Projection\nCost $\nCEO Package 80,000\nOther Operating Costs 65,500\nTotal 145,500\nCEO = chief executive officer.\n15. As the structure is under review, these costs and how they are to be met are yet to be\nfinalized. However, agreement in principle has already been made by the Australian and New\nZealand governments to meet the original base case operating costs and salaries on a 50:50\nbasis for the first three years with review a for any further subsidies.\n9. Regulatory Environment and Taxation\n16. There are no obvious barriers to the establishment and operation of the VCF, and the\nGovernment of Samoa should welcome it. The VCF will come within the ambit of the Central\nBank Act and the Financial Institutions Act, and will need to comply with those acts and\nassociated guidelines where applicable. Clarification will be needed from the Central Bank of\nSamoa on the extent of compliance required.\n17. The  major  taxation  issue  will  be  the  potential  double  taxation  of  distributions  to\nshareholders  in  the  VCF  from  retained  earnings  already  taxed.  A  secondary  issue  is  the\npossible taxation of profits on sale on investments, where the VCF\u2019s investment is by way of\nshares rather than loans. Those instances are expected to be rare, but the taxation issues\npertaining to the VCF need to be clarified.\n10. Development Value\n18. There is a clear gap in the market for equity or quasi-equity funding for the large group of\nundercapitalized businesses. No formal mechanism exists for businesses to obtain venture\ncapital funding of less than ST300,000. This is placing a severe constraint on the ability of the\nSamoan business community to generate growth in the economy. The VCF therefore has the\ncapacity to make a substantial impact on desired growth sectors generally, and with particular\nemphasis on fishing, tourism, food processing, and manufacturing.\n19. Total investment by the VCF over 7-8 years of $1.7 million-2.7 million (ST6.4 million-\nST10 million), at the normal contributions of sponsor equity could have a multiplier effect of\ncreating up to $10 million (ST37.4 million) of new investment over the period. That level of total\ninvestment would be expected to create a substantial number (estimated minimum 500, likely\nconsiderably more) of additional jobs, vital to an economy where job creation is lagging well\nbehind other growth projections and is a major policy aim of the Samoan government.\n11. Investor Considerations and Risk Factors\n20. The key country risk for external investors appears to be acceptable in view of the stable\npolitical environment and the fiscally responsible stance of the Samoan Government. The prime\nmarket risk is the small market size, and the relatively undeveloped secondary industry sector.\nFurther risk arises from the importance of expatriate remittances and aid agencies\u2019 contributions\nto the Samoan gross national product (10-20 percent each). However, both the contributions", "58\nAppendix 4, page 5\nhave  been  stable  over  time.  Clear  independence  from  Government  intervention  is  also  a\ndesirable state, especially if Government institutions are represented among the shareholders\nand directors.\n21. Investee  risk  in  small-scale  businesses  is  largely  within  the  management  of  the\nbusiness, i.e., the management is the risk. The main mitigating factors will be the objectivity,\ncompetence, and analytical skills of the VCF\u2019s management and staff, and tight investment\ncriteria to eliminate the higher risk applicants. Liquidity should be adequate if the shareholders\nset up and fund the VCF as proposed.\n12. Implementation Issues and Timetable\n22. Obtaining  confirmed  shareholder  participation,  undertaking  establishment  tasks,  and\nrecruiting the necessary management and staff is likely to take at least six months. Critical\nissues will be getting the local shareholders on board, agreeing on the modus operandi, and\nobtaining an appropriately qualified chief executive officer.", " 59 Appendix 5, page 1\nTable A5.1: Detailed Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n($)\nComponents Government ADB Total\nPolicy and Infrastructure, Institutional Strengthening 48,100 163,000 211,100\n  -  DTCI Staff Contribution 2,100 0 2,100\n  -  Database, Office for Chattels Registry 33,400 0 33,400\n  -  Office Rental for Credit Reference Facility 12,600 0 12,600\n  -  Computer Systems 0 33,000 33,000\n  -  MIS International Consultants 0 130,000 130,000\nSmall Business Development Fund 200,000 800,000 1,000,000\nSmall Business Loan Guarantee Scheme 400,000 1,120,000 1,520,000\n  -  Vehicle 0 20,000 20,000\n  -  Guarantee Fund 400,000 1,100,000 1,500,000\nPilot Microfinance 1,000 320,000 321,000\n  -  Revolving Fund 0 300,000 300,000\n  -  Vehicle 0 20,000 20,000\n  -  Promotion Costs 1,000 0 1,000\nProject Management Unit 208,551 623,049 831,600\n  -  PMU Director and Manager 123,951 341,049 465,000\n  -  International Consultants 0 120,000 120,000\n  -  Vehicle and Office Supplies 5,000 72,000 77,000\n  -  Travel Expenses 55,000 20,000 75,000\n  -  Review and Periodic PSC, PMU meetings 24,600 0 24,600\n  -  Auditing Requirements 0 50,000 50,000\nInterest Charge 0 99,416 99,416\n         Subtotal 857,651 3,125,465 3,983,116\nPrice Contingency 58,010 204,280 262,290\nPhysical Contingency 48,339 170,255 218,594\n              Total for Loan 964,000 3,500,000 4,464,000\nB.

The social assessment analyzed information on social patterns that have a bearing on\ntarget  group  preferences  and  constraints  in  the  context  of  the  proposed  Small  Business\nDevelopment Project.  Data used originate from the interviews conducted during the course of\nthe  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  and  from  a  few  other  sources,  mostly\nethnological and anthropological studies and consolidated documents of assistance agencies\nsuch as Australian Agency for International Development and the World Bank.\n2. Samoa is a relatively compact archipelagic group, consisting of two main islands\u2014Upolu\nand Savai'i, and five smaller islands, with land area covering a total of 2,820 square kilometres\n2 2\n(km ), and an exclusive economic zone of 120,000 km .  Samoa belongs to the Polynesian part\nof the Pacific, together with Cook Islands, Tonga, and French Polynesia.\n3. The country is relatively mountainous, with about 40 percent of Upolu and 50 percent of\nSavaii characterized by steep slopes descending from volcanic crests. The physically compact\nnature of the country makes it very easy for communities to communicate with each other, in\nsharp contrast to islands in Melanesia, which stretch over thousands of kilometres of sea.\n4. The two main islands are serviced by good road infrastructure, and daily ferry and air\nservices connect the two islands.\n5. The urban rural divide is relatively unpronounced on the main island of Upolu. Daily\ncommuting into Apia for work, particularly from villages in northwest Upolu, means that a\nsubstantial number of the population interchange daily between urban and rural life. Increasing\nurbanization is causing a shift in family patterns. The concept of the extended family as an\noperational unit becomes less prominent as they move from rural to urban areas. However,\nextended families still feature significantly in terms of collective support to meet obligations on a\nlarger scale.\n6. The urban drift, coupled with continuing losses from out-migration has led to a shortage\nof labor for agricultural activities and support for communal village-based activities.\n7. Agricultural production remains the main source of livelihood security for almost 70\npercent of the population, with the smallholder family producing goods for household needs, for\nsale, and for use in customary exchanges.  Formal employment in registered businesses was\n7,643 as of March 2000, excluding the Yazaki factory. Most paid employment opportunities are\nin the Apia urban area. Remittances from overseas continue to be a major source of cash\nincome within the family household.\n8. Over 80 percent of all land is customary land, which is under traditional matai control.\nThe land provides the major source of income for nearly 70 percent of the economically active\npopulation. Alienation of customary land is prohibited by law (land cannot be transferred or\nmade freehold), although lease arrangements are possible.\n9. Samoans generally are well integrated into the cash economy. Most households have\nfamily overseas who send regular remittances. In many cases, this is the only major source of\ncash  income  other  than  the  sale  of  surplus  produce.  Although  women  are  the  traditional", "71\nAppendix 10, page 2\nproducers of handicraft, the men more often obtain the income from the proceeds of any sale.\nWomen are the savers, while men control and determine the distribution of the household\nincome.\n10. Social Organization. Samoans live in villages, made up of the local members of a\nnumber of \u2018aiga, usually beteen 20 and 40, with each \u2018aiga headed by a matai who is effectively\nthe head of the family, managing its lands and house sites, allocating labor and other resources,\nand representing the group in the village council, or fono. The traditional Samoan village is\norganized according to matai, the aualuma (daughters of the village), faletua and tausi (wives of\nthe matai), and aumaga (untitled men). Authority, defence, and the production of food are the\nresponsibilities of the men, while moral authority, ceremony, hospitality, and the production of\nexchange valuables are the work of women.\n11. The Pulenu\u2019u (village mayor) is the official link between the government and the village.\nEach village elects a representative to the Pulenu\u2019u committee for a three-year term. The final\ndecision whether to accept or reject proposed development programs rests with the village\ncouncils.\n12. Villages operate as semiautonomous polities under the leadership of the council of\nchiefs, and the womens committee. Every family is represented on these two bodies. The\nvillage council decides issues affecting village law and order, land issue and use, and food\nsecurity. Their decisions are binding, and sanctions can be harsh.\n13. The  adoption  of  Christianity  in  the  nineteenth  century  brought  about  fundamental\nchanges to Samoan life and ideals. Villages become congregations through a covenant dividing\nlocal governance between the secular realm controlled by the matai councils, and the religious\nrealm, presided over by resident pastors.  The arrangement persists in every Samoan village to\ntoday.\n14. Pastors are highly honored and respected, but the relationship between a pastor and a\nvillage sets the pastor apart from other leaders. The pastor has authority over church affairs but\nno formal say in the secular affairs of a village. It is part of the covenant, that pastors may not\ntake matai titles.\n15. Pastors are called by village congregations, which the pastor's family with a house, gifts\nof food, a money income, lands for planting, etc. The money income comes from regular\ndonations from the congregation, which are publicly announced. Thus a very strong element of\ncompetition between the various aiga of a congregation exists, the outcome of which can affect\nthe status of the aiga  both in the church and the village life.\n16. Besides supporting the pastor (and family), the congregations also build and maintain\ntheir  own  churches  and  other  facilities  such  as  meeting  places.  Churches  are  generally\nelaborate and the largest of structures in the rural area. Funds are raised through special levies\non the matai of a congregation, including those living overseas, and through organized parties\ntraveling to the migrant communities in New Zealand.\n17. Most churches open with a substantial debt burden as church loans are commonly\nfavored over enterprise loans because of the good repayment record. The key to repayment is\nthe ceremonial church opening, which draw large crowds, the village as a whole and church\nmembers from other villages, all bear contributions.", "72\nAppendix 10, page 3\n18. Thus,  these  social  and  traditional  practices  influence  the  control  of  resources  and\neconomic  decision  making  at  the  household  level.  The  land  tenure  system  and  social\nconsiderations, as related to credit, savings, and enterprise development, are taken from the\ngeneral context and analyzed in greater detail. The final part of the social analysis lists the\nmajor issues and options related to social analysis.\nB. Land Tenure\n19. Some 80 percent of the land in Samoa is held under customary tenure, being divided\namong descent groups known as aiga, each of which is headed by a matai or chief, chosen by\nthe members of the aiga. The alienation of customary land is prohibited by law (land cannot be\ntransferred or made freehold), although lease arrangements are possible.\n20. The Land and Titles Court is one of the fundamental institutions of the Samoan social\nand political life. The origin of the court lies in the 1889 Berlin Treaty\u2019s prohibition of the sale of\nthe  customary  land  outside  of  Apia  boundaries.  It  also  established  a  land  commission  to\ninvestigate claims. The Land and Titles court established in 1903 continued the policy regarding\nalienation of customary land, and took on responsibility for adjudicating rival Samoan claims to\nland and matai titles.\n21. Under New Zealand administration, the prohibitions were further endorsed, and the 1962\nConstitution  laid  the  legal  framework  for  the  present  situation  whereby  land  is  held  \u201cin\naccordance with Samoan custom and usage and the law relating to Samoan custom and\nusage.\u201d The currently relevant law is the Land and Titles Court Act of 1981, which provides that,\nin all matters brought before it, the court will apply (i) customs and usage, and (ii) the law\nrelating to customs and usage.\n22. The Court\u2019s jurisdiction is exercised by a President and at least two Samoan judges and\ntwo Samoan assessors; no less than four are on the bench for any court hearing. There are no\nwritten or oral opinions, which might constitute a body of legal precedent. Each case is decided\n\u201con its own merits,\u201d having regard for both general opinion and acceptable local variations to\ncustom.\n23. There is some evidence that on-the-ground village practices have for some time been\ndiverging from what the court would regard as proper custom. There has been a considerable\ndegree of individualization, with people also being allowed to pass on lands to their immediate\nchildren, without any rights to dispose of the land through sale.\n24.  No transition freeholding of customary land is implied by the changes, although the\nsituation is further confused by the process of title-splitting and the creation of new titles for\nvoting purposes, which has been ongoing at the same time as the alleged \u201cindividualization\u201d that\nis taking place.\n25. The most recent Agricultural Survey (1993) identified that over 25 percent of agricultural\nhouseholds controlled less than the two hectares considered to be the minimum amount of land\na household would require access to, if they were to derive their total livelihood from agriculture.\nThe Apia Urban Youth Survey (1995) showed that 32 percent of youth felt that agriculture was a\nway to improve their economic life but access to land was a constraint.\n26. In summary, customary land tenure in Samoa is tied into the social organization of\nSamoans. The alienation of customary land is, and will remain, a challenging issue to tackle, as", "73\nAppendix 10, page 4\nland is the source of family identify and security. Although leasing of customary land is possible,\nthe financial Institutions reluctance to accept land leases as security has an impact on access to\ncredit.  Long-term  security  of  tenure  is  an  essential  precondition  to  extensive  agricultural\ndevelopment, which features a heavy investment in fixed assets.  With a continuing rural urban\nmigration drift, there is increased pressure for land. Demand for land is leading to the loss of an\nestimated  900  hectares  of  forest  annually  to  land  clearance  for  gardens  and  commercial\nplantations, leading to the degradation of watersheds, and increased run offs. The family matai\nallocates land to ensure that all members share the good as well as the poorer quality land, so\nland holding usually consists of a number of small parcels, not always contiguous. The division\nof such land, and the physical distance at times from the village, creates problems in working\nthe land economically.\nC. Role of Women\n27. Although women have no say in land allocation, or the village law and order, they\nnevertheless hold a strong and effective position of informal power within the village affairs.\nWomen are considered the dominant influence in terms of village development. The women\u2019s\ncommittee provides the energy, drive, and staying power that often sees a village project\nthrough to fruition.\n28. In the village ceremonial affairs, there is a clear distinction between the unmarried\nwomen (usually young and born in the village), who together make up the aualuma, and those\nwho have married in, who are collectively known as faletua ma tausi. As \u201csisters\u201d to the men of\nthe  village,  the  aualuma  have  some  status,  as  shown  by  the  part  they  play  in  the  kava\npresentations, which mark formal intervillage gatherings. The in marrying \u201cwives\u201d have a much\nlesser formal status on such occasions, and are considered subservient to their husbands.\n29. Both categories of women join the village women\u2019s committee, which is run by its own\ncouncil, with each woman filling a ranked position according to the rank of her husband.\n30. In addition to their family and household chores, women also engage in other income\nearning activities to supplement the family income. In the 20-29 year age group, an average of\n9.8 hours per week1 is devoted to the production of handicrafts, which subsequently are used as\nceremonial gifts or sold for cash.\n31. Women are the majority of informal traders. A visit to the vegetable market at Fugaleii\nand the handicraft market confirms women operate the majority of stalls. However, the control of\nthe income clearly lies with the male of the household.\n32. The labor economy and division of labor within the household resembles at other areas\nof Polynesia. The men of the household take prime responsibility for undertaking household\nagriculture, farming, and fishing, while the female devotes her time to cooking, washing, looking\nafter children, and handicraft production. Women do not provide substantial inputs into the\nproduction of agricultural crops or produce, although the contribution of women and children to\nthe small family units is becoming more significant with the labor shortage. The women are\nresponsible for managing the family budget relative to the payment of school fees, etc.\n                                                \n1 1997 Household Income and Expenditure Diary entries Table 5.1.", "74\nAppendix 10, page 5\n33. At marriage, a woman will generally move to her husband\u2019s village. She does not,\nhowever, lose membership of her natural aiga, and can still become involved in meetings\nconcerned with title bestowals in the same way as other members do.\nD. Village Business Enterprises\n34. Pisinisi, the Samoan word for business, has been an established part of most villages\nsince the beginning of the century, when retail stores were set up, which also acted as buyers of\ncopra for urban interests. In more recent years, they have been joined by bus operators, taxis,\nand small beach fale enterprises aimed at the domestic and international lower-priced tourist\nmarket.\n35. Pisinisi carries prestige, distinguishing a person from other villagers, who are generally\npleased to make use of the services provided. Credit sales is an ever-present risk, and is a\nmajor cause of business failure within the rural sector. Field work carried out during the TA\nidentified that although a village-based business might collapse as a result of credit not being\nrepaid, the members of the village who brought about the collapse through not repaying, felt no\nshame, while the entrepreneur whose business failed often felt acutely embarrassed, with\nseveral examples being cited where the entrepreneur left the village completely.\n36. There is an expectation that village businesses will contribute generously to village\nactivities,  with  the  villagers  reciprocating  through  increased  loyalty  and  support  for  the\nentrepreneur. Such success can be readily converted into worthwhile matai titles.\n37. The long-term ambition of such businessmen is to become a member of Parliament for\ntheir district, cashing in the obligations, loyalties, and trust they have built up over the years.\n38. A  lack  of  exposure  to  new  ideas  has  led  to  a  copy  cat  mentality  among  rural\nentrepreneurs, as evidenced by the number of small retail food stores that can sometimes be\nfound in one single village of 300-400 people. The four essential elements for microenterprise\ndevelopment  are  access  to  finance,  markets,  management,  and  technical  training.  A\ndiversification  of  the  economic  activities  at  the  village  level  is  an  essential  element  for\ndeveloping this sector.\n39. Remittances in cash and in kind from overseas are often a high component of total\nincomes received in rural households. The 1998 household income and expenditure survey\nidentified, on a national basis, in excess of 12 percent of all household income comes from\noverseas remittances. This component of total income is highest on the island of Savai'i, where\n19.4 percent of total income is derived from overseas. The Women in Business Foundation\nidentify this as a specific disincentive at the village level for starting microenterprises. Within a\nnational context, remittances are expected to maintain their long-term growth trend rate of\naround 3 percent in 2000.\nE. Savings and Credit\n40. Within the Samoan culture, it is rare for an individual to accumulate wealth. Instead,\npeople are expected to give money, goods, and services to meet the social obligations of their\nfamilies through fa\u2019alavelave. The family matai is responsible for distributing these items on\nbehalf of the family. Obligations under fa\u2019alavelave can be demanding and immediate, often\nrequiring families to contribute to the costs of funerals and weddings at very short notice.", "75\nAppendix 10, page 6\nIgnoring these responsibilities can result in being ostracized within the family and cut off socially\nfrom the village.\n41. Negative  saving  has  prevailed  since  1985,  largely  the  result  of  high  levels  of\nconsumption induced by substantial inflows of personal remittances from overseas. Previous\nstudies have concluded that \u201cSamoans do not save,\u201d although this needs to be considered in\nthe context of social and cultural obligations imposed through fa\u2019alavelave.\n42. Fa\u2019alavelale does represent a form of obligation on the part of the party receiving the\nbenefits of fa\u2019alavelave to reciprocate in kind at some yet to be determined time in the future.\nWithin the villages, a number of business entrepreneurs provide a form of in-kind credit to rural\nhouseholds, either taking security over a fine mat or similar, or trading credit for copra, thus\nexpanding their clientele.\n43. The absence of a reliable, and regular source of income among village households,\nplaces further obligations on wageearners to act as personal guarantors to those wishing to\naccess credit for business purposes. The change in emphasis by the Development Bank of\nSamoa from debt servicing being met from the proceeds of the microenterprise, to one of\nserviceability coming from regular income of the borrower and guarantors further reinforces\nthese obligations.", "76\nAppendix 11, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\nCAPACITY BUILDING OF FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS ADVISORY INTERMEDIARIES\nA.  Objectives and Scope\n1.
