INTRODUCTION \n1.  The country partnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nKazakhstan highlights the need to apply knowledge solutions effectively and adopt global best \npractices to become a more diversified, competitive, and inclusive economy, and to go beyond \nthe middle-income country stage.1 In 2013, the government and ADB agreed to establish the \njoint  Knowledge  and  Experience  Exchange  Program  (KEEP)  aimed  at  facilitating  various \ncutting-edge strategic knowledge options and global best practices to equip Kazakhstan to \nrespond to the current and emerging development opportunities and challenges in a well-\ninformed and timely manner. The KEEP framework (outlining the objective and scope, areas of \nfocus, implementation arrangements, and monitoring and evaluation measures) is defined in a \nmemorandum of understanding (MOU) between the government and ADB signed in June 2013. \nThe MOU commits the parties to share the cost of activities during the implementation of the \nprogram\u2019s three phases; total financing amounts to $2,500,000, and the government will finance \n50% of the cost.2 The MOU is in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n2.  The implementation of the first phase of KEEP began with a technical assistance (TA) \nproject approved in July 2013.3 The policy and advisory TA proposed now will finance the \nsecond phase of KEEP in 2015\u20132018. It is included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, \n2015\u20132017 for Kazakhstan.4 Details of the TA were discussed with the government in several \nmeetings throughout 2015 in line with the TA design and monitoring framework in Appendix 1.5 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Since its independence in 1991, Kazakhstan has transitioned rapidly from a low-income \ncountry  to  an  upper  middle-income  country  and  has  rated  highly  in  many  socioeconomic \nindicators. Over the last two decades, Kazakhstan\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) increased \ndramatically from $24.9 billion to $231.9 billion, making Kazakhstan the largest economy in \nCentral Asia and the second largest in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Accordingly, \nGDP  per  capita  increased  ninefold  from  $1,512  to  $13,611.6 This  impressive  economic \nperformance  was  primarily  supported  by  expanding  oil  production  and  high  oil  prices. \nKazakhstan also made significant progress in maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment, \nbeing ranked particularly high on economic environment indicators such as government budget \nbalance, gross national savings, inflation, government debt, and country credit rating.7 \n \n4.  Despite the economic performance, Kazakhstan still faces development challenges and \nvulnerabilities which, if not resolved in an efficient and timely manner, may undermine the \ncountry\u2019s  socioeconomic  development  and  expose  it to  external  shocks. These  challenges \ninclude (i) the economy\u2019s high dependence on extractive industries, which is mainly expressed \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012.

Moreover, \nthe  ongoing  regional  and  global  integration  processes,  such  as  Kazakhstan\u2019s  anticipated \naccession to the World Trade Organization and membership in the Eurasian Economic Union, \ncall for better-informed policy decisions. \n \n5.  Recognizing these challenges, the Government of Kazakhstan has formulated national \nstrategic plans\u2014the Kazakhstan\u20132030 Strategy and the Strategic Development Plan of the \nRepublic of Kazakhstan till 2020.8 In 2012, President Nursultan Nazarbayev announced a new \nlong-term vision, Kazakhstan\u20132050, of turning the country into one of the top 30 developed \nnations  by  2050.9 It  emphasizes  the  importance  of  developing  not  only  traditional  sectors \n(extractive industries, manufacturing, services, and agriculture) but also new, innovative areas \nto help transform Kazakhstan into a knowledge-based economy. Key milestones are: (i) the \nshare of non-oil exports in the country\u2019s total exports to double by 2025, and to triple by 2040; \n(ii) the share of agricultural production in GDP to increase fivefold by 2050; and (iii) renewable \nenergy to account for up to 50% of domestic energy consumption by 2050. Particular attention \nis paid to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as an engine of \neconomic growth, diversification, and inclusion\u2014their share in the domestic economy is to \ndouble by 2030. \n \n6.  Against the backdrop of difficult external conditions (i.e., slowing world economic growth, \nfalling oil prices, and an economic slowdown in the Russian Federation), the government has \ntaken  stimulus  measures  to  prevent  negative  consequences  on  the  domestic  economy. \nAdditional funds have been allocated from the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan in \n2014 to finance the development of SMEs, new economic zones, and infrastructure, and the \nresolution of nonperforming loans. In addition, a new economic policy\u2014Nurly Zhol\u2014has been \nlaunched to support key structural reforms to the economy, further infrastructure and SME \ndevelopment,  and to  stimulate  the transformation  to  a knowledge-based  economy.  Further \nemphasis is given to the development of the service sector as a mean to enable economic \ndiversification and inclusive growth; the aim is to increase the share of services in GDP from the \ncurrent 54% to 70%. \n \n7.  Achieving  these  ambitious  goals  would  require  not  only  strong  commitment  and \ncoordination within the government, but also substantial human resources development through \nknowledge and experience exchange and effective policy advice. The government signed the \nPartnership Framework Arrangement (PFA) with ADB during the 47th Annual Meeting in Astana \nin 2014. The PFA aims to help accelerate the diversification of the economy and increase the \ncompetitiveness of exports and the ability to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. Through \nthe PFA, ADB will assist the government in implementing its development program by providing \neffective stewardship of the resources of the National Fund of the Republic of Kazakhstan. \n \n                                                \n8  Government of Kazakhstan. 1997.

In this context, KEEP has become an important vehicle for supplementing the analytical \nwork under the PFA: it supports just-in-time knowledge requests prioritized by the government \nbut not financed through longer-term TA funds. Phase 1 of KEEP has helped the government \nwith studies in six areas: (i) market concentration and competition, (ii) economic diversification \nwith a focus on the services sector, (iii) support for the development of the government\u2019s new \neconomic policy, (iv) economic costs of road traffic accidents in Kazakhstan, (v) procurement of \nperformance-based road maintenance services, and (vi) capacity building for SME financing. \nThe government highly appreciates this TA modality, which helps meet emerging policy and \nadvisory, and capacity development requirements, bringing best global practices and knowledge \nand  tailoring  them  to  Kazakhstan\u2019s  context.  The  government  and  ADB  have  defined  new \npotential areas for support\u2014e.g., public management, audit, and finance\u2014for which funding will \nbe required in 2015\u20132018. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact is aligned with the government\u2019s objectives of achieving a more competitive \nand  inclusive  economy,  developing  human  capital,  and  enhancing  institutions  and \ngovernance.10 The outcome will be the strengthened government capacity and awareness of \nbest practices in selected areas. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  follow  the  implementation  approach  used  for  the  first  phase  of  KEEP \n(footnote 3). The scope of the TA covers the following main themes: (i) inclusive growth and \neconomic diversification, (ii) institutional and policy development, (iii) regional cooperation and \nintegration, and (iv) competitiveness and efficiency enhancement. The TA will support macro, \nsector,  and  thematic  subprojects  that  enable  or  promote  knowledge  solutions,  capacity \ndevelopment,  and  exchange  of  best  practices.  Due  to  the  dynamic  nature  of  government \ndemand for advisory and other knowledge products and services, the selection of subprojects \nand the implementation approach will be flexible so as to respond to the knowledge requests \nquickly and effectively. \n \n11.  The subprojects to be financed will therefore remain tentative to provide the scope for \nadjustment and allow for quick responses. While some subprojects have been discussed with \nthe government during TA processing, other subprojects will be firmed up during implementation. \nA list of potential subprojects will be finalized within 1 month after the TA is approved and will be \nreviewed as necessary. A tentative list of proposed subprojects is in Supplementary Appendix B. \n \n12.  The criteria for selecting subprojects would be that the subproject (i) supports priority \ngovernment  policy  reforms  and  is  consistent  with  the  country  partnership  strategy;  (ii)  is \nsupporting the implementation of the government development strategy; (iii) is considered an \nemerging, urgent, and high-priority area where ADB can add the greatest value; (iv) shows \nevidence of strong government ownership; and (v) complements or synergizes the knowledge \nsupport of other development partners. \n \n                                                \n10  Government of Kazakhstan. 2014. Concept of the Republic of Kazakhstan's Entry into the Top 30 Developed \nCountries. Astana. \n ", "4 \n13.  The main outputs of the TA will fall under the categories of (i) policy and advisory and (ii) \ncapacity development, and include analytical reports that will serve as background materials for \nthe government\u2019s policymaking and the capacity-building and learning events. \n \n14.  Effective  coordination  of  the  executing  agency  with  stakeholders  is  important  for  a \nsuccessful implementation of the TA. The related potential risks are (i) ineffective use of policy \nrecommendations because of frequent turnover of officials, (ii) weak collaboration and support \nfrom all stakeholders, and (iii) unavailability of reliable and accurate data and information. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, which ADB will initially allocate on a grant basis \nfrom ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources). The government will \nreimburse 50% of the total TA cost by transferring $500,000 to ADB\u2019s TASF account after \nADB\u2019s approval of the TA. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The Ministry of National Economy (MNE), through its Department for Investment Policy \nand  Public\u2013Private  Partnership  Development, will  be  the  executing  agency  responsible for \nsupervising and monitoring the TA activities. The ministries or agencies responsible for initiating \nthe  specific  subprojects  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  ADB,  through  its  Kazakhstan \nResident Mission, will administer the TA. Counterpart staff at ADB headquarters will contribute \nto the management of subprojects, where necessary. \n \n17.  The KEEP Coordinating Committee (KCC), comprising representatives of the MNE and \nADB, was set up to oversee KEEP implementation. Since the implementation of phase 1 of \nKEEP began, the KCC has had several meetings to discuss and update the list of subprojects, \nand the main implementation issues. All agreements reached by the MNE and ADB during the \nmeetings were recorded, and the subproject list was updated accordingly. Selected subprojects \nand proposed working plans with cost estimates were approved by the vice-minister of the MNE \nand the country director of ADB\u2019s Kazakhstan Resident Mission. The policy and advisory TA will \nfollow the same pattern. The KCC Secretariat supports the KCC by smoothing its functioning, \nsupervising  and  coordinating  day-to-day  KEEP  activities,  monitoring  the  implementation \nprogress, resolving issues, if any, arranging meetings, and liaising with ministries and agencies. \nAn overview of the KCC and its secretariat is in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \n18.  Monitoring  of  the  TA  will  be  results-oriented.  A  main  measurement  for  subproject \noutcome is to see if recommendations emanating from the TA are used by the government. \nMonitoring will be done by the KCC through its secretariat. The KCC Secretariat will coordinate \nclosely with all agencies carrying out the subprojects and make sure that issues are dealt with \nas they arise. Under the overall direction and guidance of the KCC, the KCC Secretariat shall \nprepare quarterly progress reports and a TA completion report. The final evaluation of the TA \nwill be based on performance indicators outlined in the design and monitoring framework. \n \n19.  The KCC will disseminate good practices and lessons learned through reports and \nworkshops, as well as ADB and government websites. The KCC will see to it that these good \npractices and lessons are adequately reflected in subsequent KEEP subprojects, and relevant \ngovernment and ADB projects. \n \n ", "5 \n20.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  32  months,  from  July  2015  to  March  2018. \nEngagements of consultants under KEEP will be in line with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2013, as amended from time to time). Disbursements will be in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n21.  The TA will use an estimated 24 person-months of national and 18 person-months of \ninternational consulting inputs to support research, workshops, and other agreed subproject \nactivities. The nature of the needed expertise and inputs will be determined case by case for \neach activity or subproject determined and approved jointly by the MNE and ADB. The inputs of \nconsultants as well as short-term resource persons will serve to introduce international best \npractices; provide in-depth local knowledge; and advise on policy options, challenges, and the \nimplications of various courses of action. The selection method for consultants will be chosen \nduring implementation depending on what is best suited to the respective terms of reference \n(TOR).  If  the  TA  requires  the  services  of  a  consulting  firm,  the  firm  will  be  recruited  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. All consultants and experts will \nbe engaged based on their expertise and proven experience in the subproject areas. \n \n22.  The  detailed  TOR,  including  duration  and  expected  results,  will  be  discussed  and \nprepared as soon as the proposed subprojects are finalized and cleared by ADB and the \ngovernment. KCC will also coordinate with ADB departments to engage the most experienced \nADB staff in the implementation of subprojects. The generic outline of the scope of work to be \ncarried out by consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a reimbursable \nbasis, as discussed in para. 15, to the Government of Kazakhstan for the Joint Government of \nKazakhstan and the Asian Development Bank Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program, \nPhase 2, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the technical assistance is aligned with: \n \nAchieving a more competitive and inclusive economy, developing human capital, and enhancing \ninstitutions and governance (Concept of the Republic of Kazakhstan's Entry into the Top 30 \nDeveloped Countries, 2014)a \n \n \nData Sources or \nPerformance Indicators with  Reporting \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nGovernment  By 2018, recommendations  a.
