INTRODUCTION \n1.  Since starting its operations in India in 1986, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \napproved 115 projects for $24 billion. These totals include regular project and program loans \nand multitranche financing facilities (whose amounts have been calculated on a full-facility \nbasis). Initially, most loans were to finance national projects, but since 1998 more ADB loans \nhave financed state projects. ADB\u2019s active portfolio in India as of 1 July 2010 consisted of 14 \nloans each in energy and transport, 13 in urban development, 9 in finance and governance, and \n2 in agriculture. Almost half of the net loan amount was to state governments or state agencies, \nspread across 18 states. In recent years ADB operations have expanded rapidly to such states \nas  Chattisgarh,  Jharkhand,  Orissa,  Uttarakhand  and  the  north  eastern  states  (Meghalaya, \nMizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura). In 2010, Delhi, Goa, Haryana, Maharashtra, Punjab, \nand Uttar Pradesh are likely to join the India portfolio. Many of the executing agencies (EAs) \ninvolved in ADB projects have limited capacity to implement large development projects so ADB \nhas been providing capacity development technical assistance (TA) to conduct training for EA \nstaff and to mentor them.1 \n \n2.  So far, the TA provided by ADB has addressed specific themes or project needs. A \ncommon capacity development action plan that cuts across projects and covers the entire \nproject cycle is needed. The Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) of the Government of India \nand project EAs have asked ADB on various occasions, including during the tripartite portfolio \nreview meetings (TPRM) to conduct capacity development programs to enhance EAs\u2019 project \nimplementation  and  management  capacity  and  to  improve  project  readiness  at  entry.  In \nresponse, a new TA was included in the ADB country operations business plan, 2010. Following \na discussion with the DEA, a consensus was reached on the purpose, scope, implementation \narrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. The design and \nmonitoring framework for the TA is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The India Resident Mission has been conducting TPRMs since September 2005 to \nreview project performance, identify common and specific problems in project implementation, \nformulate  time-bound  action  plans  to  address  those  problems,  and  reach  agreement  on \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2009.

Important measures identified at TPRMs to \nimprove  the  portfolio  performance  include  (i)  improving  awareness  of  ADB's  procedures \ngoverning  procurement,  consultant  selection,  disbursement,  and  safeguard  procedures;  \n(ii)  increasing  the  participation  of  contractors  in  bidding  by  disseminating  procurement \ninformation through national and project-specific business opportunity seminars; (iii) improving \ncontract  management  of  EAs  through  capacity  development  in  contract  administration;  \n(iv)  streamlining  approvals  for  preconstruction  activities  and  environmental  clearances;  \n(v)  identifying  opportunities  for  public\u2013private  partnerships  under  ADB-financed  projects;  \n(vi)  conducting  joint  field  visits;  (vii)  focusing  on  the  reform  agenda  and  sustainability,  \n(viii)  improving  project  readiness  at  entry  through  a  checklist;  and  (ix)  disseminating  best \npractices and innovations in project implementation. \n \n4.  Since 2008, DEA, EAs and ADB have placed greater emphasis on achieving outputs \nand outcomes and in making progress with the reform agenda at the TPRM, in addition to \nreviewing the achievements of contract awards and disbursement against targets. This change \nin emphasis requires capacity development in areas that are central to achieving sector reforms. \n \n5.  The India Resident Mission conducted a training needs assessment survey in June 2008 \namong EAs of ongoing and future projects in consultation with the DEA. EAs identified a training \nrequirement for 6,400 EA staff in ADB policies on safeguards, contract administration, project \nmanagement, procurement, consultancy selection and disbursement, in addition to other topics \nsuch as detailed project report preparation, operation and maintenance, quality assurance, \ngeographical  information  systems  and  mapping,  construction  technologies,  design  of  flood \ncontrol  structures,  computer-aided  design  for  urban  projects,  tunneling  technologies, \nenvironmental management, community mobilization, and market research and surveying. A \nnew training needs assessment survey has been initiated to assess the training needs of EA \nstaff for 2010\u20132012. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the TA would be timely delivery of the project benefits. The outcome of \nthe TA would be improved capacities of EA staff in implementing ADB-financed projects.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  The TA is expected to deliver training programs to about 3,500 EA staff working on \nongoing and future ADB-financed projects.  A training calendar for 2010\u20132013 will list all training \ntopics pertaining to project implementation and thematic areas with tentative training dates. The \ntraining modules will be designed to improve awareness of existing government systems in \naddition to ADB procedures. The calendar will be disseminated to EAs and posted on the \nresident mission website to enable EAs to plan the participation of their staff in advance.  \n \n8.  Project implementation training programs will cover ADB procedures on procurement, \nconsultant  selection,  disbursement,  and  safeguard  procedures  in  addition  to  contract \nadministration using the Federation of International Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) conditions of \ncontract and project management. Staff from ADB\u2019s Central Operations Services Office will \nconduct sessions during these programs to address procurement issues raised by EA staff. The \ntraining will consist of national and project-specific programs.  The project management module \nwill include monitoring and evaluation techniques. About 24 national and 10 project-specific \nprograms  on  project  implementation  will  be  provided  to  about  2,800  EA  staff.  Project \nimplementation training programs will target middle and junior management.   \n ", "3   \n9.  Training in thematic topics will cover such topics as sector and institutional reform to \nimprove sector performance, service delivery, and sustainability. Specific issues that have been \nidentified  include  water  tariffs,  nonrevenue  water,  sewerage  charges,  power  sector  loss \nreductions,  carbon  credits,  road  safety,  sustainable  transport,  quality  control,  asset \nmanagement, public\u2013private partnership, and gender. About 14 programs will be provided to \nabout 700 EA staff. Thematic training programs will target senior management. \n \n10.  Cross-learning will be promoted by encouraging EA staff to visit project sites of projects \nthat are performing well to learn from their implementation experience. Best practices identified \nduring project preparation and implementation will be disseminated among the EAs and other \nstakeholders.  \n  \n11.  National and project-specific business opportunity seminars will be conducted to improve \nthe participation of contractors, consultants, and NGOs in ADB-funded projects. Information on \nprocurement  and  consultancy  opportunities  under  national  and  ADB  procedures  will  be \ndistributed.  \n \n12.  The resident mission will deliver the training programs through national and international \nagencies, academic institutions, training center at the resident mission and through national \nconsultants who will visit project offices. The national consultants will provide mentoring support \nto EAs as they prepare bid documents and evaluate bids. This mentoring support will be \nfocused on new projects where the loan consultants have not been engaged. Where loan \nconsultants have been fielded, the mentoring will not duplicate their inputs.   \n \n13.  Participants  and  project  directors  will  be  able  to  register  for  courses  and  provide \nfeedback via the resident mission website.  \n \n14.  The resident mission will identify national academic institutions to conduct the training \nprograms.  The  institutions  will  charge  the  EAs  fees  for  these  training  programs.  ADB,  in \nconsultation with the DEA, will encourage EAs to pay a portion of these fees from the training \nallocations under  their  loans.  This  will  improve  the  long-term  sustainability  of  the  capacity \nbuilding programs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is $2 million, of which $1.5 million will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \ncontribute $500,000 toward the travel costs, per diem, and salary of government agency staff \nparticipating  in  the  training  programs.  Expenditure  related  to  accommodation,  food  for  the \nparticipants,  training  venues,  travel  cost  of  ADB  resource  persons,  total  cost  of  non-ADB \nresource persons, and training materials will be paid from the TA. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The DEA, Ministry of Finance, Government of India will be the EA. The TA will be \nimplemented  from  15  September  2010  to  30  September  2013.  One  individual  national \nconsultant will be recruited for 24 person-months under the TA to conduct project-specific \ncapacity development programs on ADB\u2019s procurement and consultant selection procedures \nand to provide mentoring support to EAs as they prepare documentation. Individual international \nconsultants will be recruited for 16 person-days and one national consultant will be recruited for \n8 person-days to conduct training programs on the FIDIC conditions of contract through the \nConsulting Engineers Association of India (CEAI). One individual national consultant will be \nrecruited for 3 person-months intermittently to advice on structuring, delivery and evaluation of \n ", "  4\ncapacity development programs under the TA. The consultants will be engaged in accordance \nwith the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB \nwill also provide staff as resource persons, organize the training programs and provide training \nmaterials. The government will meet expenditure related to travel, per diem, and salary of EA \nstaff participating in the training programs. \n \n17.  The resident mission will organize the training programs on ADB procedures with the \nhelp of resource persons from ADB and national consultants. The travel cost of ADB resource \npersons and the total cost of non-ADB resource persons will be met from TA funds. Training \nprograms  on  thematic  topics  will be  conducted  with  the  help  of  national  and  international \nagencies or academic institutions with established expertise in these areas. The travel and \nrelated costs of resource persons for thematic topics will be met from TA funds. Programs on \ncontract administration will be outsourced to CEAI using single-source selection as it is the only \nFIDIC member in India and is authorized to conduct FIDIC-accredited training seminars under \nan agreement between CEAI and FIDIC. A respected academic institution will be selected to \ndesign and deliver a project management program that is relevant to government agency staff.  \n \n18.  The selection of EA staff for training programs will be done in consultation with the DEA.  \nFor project implementation training programs, preference will be given to middle and lower \nmanagement as these categories have a lower attrition rate. This will ensure continuity of \ntrained  staff  on  the  projects  during  implementation.  For  thematic  training  programs, \npreference will be given to senior management as the programs deal with policy issues. \nStaff from ongoing and future projects will attend the same sessions to encourage cross- \nlearning. Detailed selection criteria will be developed during implementation in consultation \nwith the DEA. \n \n19.  Under the TA, training material will be printed locally. This will reduce costs and simplify \nlogistical arrangements (currently training materials are shipped from Manila).  \n \n20.   An annual capacity development report will be prepared to document the improvement \nin the portfolio, the training programs conducted, feedback from participants, best practices, and \nsector  and  thematic  knowledge.  The  report  will  be  published  and  disseminated  to  all \nstakeholders.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION    \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of India for Capacity Development for Project Implementation and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n ", "5    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData Sources and/or \nDesign  Performance Targets  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nTimely delivery of benefits of  Project outcomes  Project Completion  EAs  will  remain  committed \nADB-funded projects  specified in Report and  Reports (PCR)  and willing to spare their staff \nRecommendations of the    for training  \nPresident (RRPs)   \n  Trained staff will be retained \nOutcome      in project posts \n       \nImproved capacity of EAs in  Shortened processing  Project documents  Risks \nimplementing ADB-financed  time of procurement,  pertaining to   \nprojects   consultancy selection and  procurement,  Lack  of  willingness  of \n  disbursement-related  consultancy selection,  identified  institutes  and \n  documents  disbursement and  resource persons to continue \n    safeguard issues  the  capacity  development \n  Improved compliance  programs after the closure of \n  level of safeguard-related  the TA \ndocuments \n \nOutputs     \n     \nCompletion of training  49 training programs  Training reports \nprograms as scheduled  conducted  submitted by the \n    resident mission every \n    6 months \n     \n  3,500 EA staff trained  Data on people trained \n    available on the \n    resident mission \n    website \n     \n     \nInstitutionalization of capacity  Written commitment from  MOU or agreement \nbuilding programs at   academic institutes to  with academic \nselected academic institutes  continue the programs  institutes \n \n \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n   \n1.1 Preparation of training calendar (September 2010)   \n  ADB                $1.500 million \n1.2 Selection of national consultants (November 2010)     Government    $0.500 million \n                           Total                $2.000 million \n1.3 Finalization of training material for ADB procedures (September  2010)           \n                           \n2.1.Organizing one national level training  program  on ADB Procedures (September   \n2010) \n \n2.2 Organizing four project specific training programs  (September-November 2010)   \n \n3.1 Organizing one national training  program  on ADB procedures (February  2011)  \n                                  \n3.2 Organizing two  programs on contract administration (FIDIC Conditions of \nContract) and one program on project management (June 2011)  \n                         \n3.3 Organizing one national training  program  on ADB procedures (Sept  2011) \n \n3.4 Organizing four project- specific training programs (April, July, Sept & Nov 2011)   \n ", "  Appendix 1  6\n                                            \n4.1 Organizing one national training  program on ADB procedures (February  2012) \n                                        \n4.2 Organizing two  programs on contract administration (FIDIC conditions of \ncontract) and one program on project management (June 2012)   \n       \n4.3 Organizing one national training  program  on ADB procedures (September \n2012)   \n                                            \n4.4 Organizing four project-specific training programs (April, July, September & \nNovember 2012)              \n \n5.1 Organizing two project-specific training programs (April, July 2013)    \n \n6.1   Agreement with academic Institutions (July 2013)                    \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \nSource: Asian Development Bank Estimates. \n \n \n \n ", "7    Appendix 2 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n \n  Total \nItem  Cost \nA.
