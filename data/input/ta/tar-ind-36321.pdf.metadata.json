Between 1951 and 1991, the urban population of India\u2019s cities more than tripled, from \n62.4 million to 217.6 million. Nearly two thirds of India\u2019s population live in urban areas, and \nnearly half of the urban population is concentrated in 23 metropolitan areas with populations \nexceeding 1 million. Urban planners and city governments have been unable to deal with all the \nresulting environmental and other problems. Residential colonies and commercial centers have \ncropped up in an unplanned manner with inadequate infrastructure to support their needs. Due \nto the absence of integrated urban planning, industrial areas have been developed close to \ntown centers and residential areas.  Furthermore, the number of diesel and gasoline fuelled \nvehicles has greatly increased. Increased urbanization, industrialization, and mobility have \ncontributed to poor air quality in many of the cities in India. The Government of India has \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) to help \nprepare a Project to provide clean fuels (essentially compressed natural gas [CNG] and natural \ngas) to six cities for transport, domestic, industrial, and commercial use to help reduce air \npollution in the selected cities. The TA is included in the India country strategy and program \n2003\u20132006.  The  Fact-Finding  Mission,  conducted  on  20  \u2013  29  June  2003,  resulted  in  an \nunderstanding with the Government on the components, scope, budget, and implementation \narrangements of the TA.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Urban areas in India are affected by two kinds of air pollution: ambient air pollution, \nespecially  fine  particulate  matter,  caused  by  emissions  from  mobile,  stationary,  and  area \nsources; and indoor air pollution. The growth in mobility has caused a huge increase in the \nnumber of petrol and diesel fueled vehicles on the roads. Congested living conditions combined \nwith  increasing  pollution  levels  have  resulted  in  chronic  health  problems.  The  number  of \nheart-related illnesses, acute respiratory infections, chronic obstructive lung diseases (such as \nasthma and bronchitis), lung cancer cases, and pregnancy-related problems have increased \nnoticeably. A 1997 World Bank study of New Delhi illustrates the positive significant relationship \nbetween particulate pollution and daily nontraumatic deaths, as well as deaths from specific \ncauses  for  certain  age  groups.  The  Study  projected  that  a  100  milligram  per  cubic \nmeter (mg/m3) increase in total suspended particles in New Delhi would result in a loss of about \n1,385 lives in a year. Another World Bank study concluded that air pollution in Mumbai causes \nair 2,800 cases of premature deaths, 60 million respiratory symptom days, and 19 million \nrestricted activity days, all of which are valued at a total cost of Rs18 billion a year. Similar \nstudies by other bodies have also indicated that ambient air pollution is leading to severe \nrespiratory  disorders.    The  recent  ban  on  diesel  buses  and  the  corresponding  massive \nconversion to CNG in New Delhi has demonstrated the impact fuel switching can have on air \nquality levels. Substantial reductions in especially particulate matter have occurred during the \nlast 2 years.2  \n \n3.  Taking cognizance of a public interest litigation application3 filed before it, the Supreme \nCourt of India has stressed the need for incentives to identify the polluting sources and launch \narea-wide action plans for pollution control. The court has directed the Government to prepare \n                                                 \n1  The TA was listed in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition), on 13 May 2003 \n2  According to monitoring by the Central Pollution Control Board, levels of suspended particulate matter (PM 10) in \nthe downtown area were found to have decreased by as much as 50% 5 days after the ban on diesel buses was \nimposed by the Supreme Court of India in 2002. This ban was applicable to 6,000 buses in Delhi.  \n3  PIL: An application filed before the Supreme Court of India by any citizen/groups/organizations when they are \nadversely impacted by any issue/activity that is not being addressed by the Government. ", "2 \naction to control pollution in cities and towns that do not meet national ambient air quality \nstandards. In an aggressive order, passed in May 2002, the Court has stated: \u201c \u2026we may note \nhere that there are, as per Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, at least nine other \n(than Delhi) cities in India where the air quality is critical. These cities are: (i) Agra, (ii) Lucknow, \n(iii) Jharia, (iv) Chennai, (v) Varanasi, (vi) Faridabad, (vii) Patna, (viii) Jodhpur, and (ix) Pune. \nBut there appears no effective plan to address the problem of the cities. If no immediate action \nis taken, then it may become necessary for some orders being passed so as to bring relief to \nthe residents of these cities.\u201d \n \n4.  While the Government has been aware of the increasing pollution levels, the Supreme \nCourt order provided the impetus for expeditious action.  As a follow-up of the Supreme Court\u2019s \ndirectives, the Government directed the Gas Authority of  India, Ltd. (GAIL) to identify the \npollution sources, assess the pollution load, and prepare for each city, an action plan for control \nof pollution levels from various sources and sectors, including automobiles, industries, and other \nsources. GAIL has conducted preliminary studies and has submitted an action plan for cleaning \nup the air in six cities: Agra, Faridabad, Kanpur, Kolkata, Lucknow, and Pune. The cities were \nselected based on a combination of air quality problems and the availability of CNG. \n \n5.  Despite a history of producing hydrocarbons for over 100 years, India is not a significant \nproducer of either oil or gas. Therefore, with a consistent gross domestic product (GDP) growth \nof  about  6%  in  the  last  decade,  the  demand  for  natural  gas  has  outstripped  domestic \nproduction. While domestic production has been hovering around 75 million standard cubic \nmeters (MMSCM) per year, the demand for natural gas is currently close to 120 MMSCM per \nyear.  GAIL  manages  India\u2019s  main  2,600  kilometers  (kms)  gas  transmission \nHazira-Bijaypur-Jagdishpur (HBJ) pipeline. In the last 10 years the Government has taken fresh \ninitiatives  to  enhance  private  sector  participation  in  the  exploration  and  production  of \nhydrocarbons. As a result, a major gas field was discovered in the eastern offshore area by the \nprivate sector but it will take 4  \u2013 5 years to fully appraise and develop this discovery. To \nenhance  availability  of  natural  gas  in  India,  the  Government  has  removed  all  licensing \nrestrictions and slashed duties for the import of liquefied natural gas (LNG). This has resulted in \ninitiatives by the private sector to import LNG into India. Such projects have, however, a long \ngestation period and therefore the HBJ is likely to be the most important source of natural gas \nsupplies in the country for the next few years. Hence, the cites selected by GAIL to be taken up \nin the first phase of the Project, with the exception of Kolkata and Pune, are those that close to \nthe HBJ pipeline. GAIL has assured that ADB supply of gas will be available for these two cities \nfrom independent sources.  \n \n6.  GAIL proposes to take up the proposed Project in two phases. The Board of Directors of \nGAIL has already approved phase 1 for Agra, Faridabad, Kanpur, Lucknow, and Pune. This will \ninvolve (i) setting up a main station with one or two substations for dispensing CNG to natural \ngas vehicles, (ii) providing gas supply to about 1,000 domestic customers, and (iii) providing \nnatural gas through pipelines to a few commercial establishments. As per initial calculations by \nGAIL, this phase of the Project, to be taken up in 2004, is estimated to cost $150 million. For the \nsecond phase, the supply network will be extended to larger parts of the cities (to the extent that \nlaying of pipelines is feasible) to cover homes, commercial and industrial establishments, and \nCNG supply stations will be set up for selling CNG for motor vehicles. This phase of the Project \nis estimated to cost an additional $150 million. No detailed estimates have been made  for \nKolkata; however, considering the size of the city, its population, and needs, the costs for \nKolkata will be substantial. GAIL has requested ADB to consider providing assistance to both \nphases of  the Project. GAIL is well experienced in managing natural gas and CNG supplies in \nurban areas. A relatively large network has been developed through joint ventures (with the ", "    3 \nprivate sector) in Delhi and Mumbai. Delhi has a network connecting 15,000 domestic and \n91 commercial customers. Also 110 CNG stations have been built catering to over 9,000 buses, \n5,000 mini buses, 14,500 cars and taxis, and 51,500 scooters.  The total cost of the Delhi \n(Indraprastha Gas, Ltd.) project is about $320 million of which $100 million has been spent. \nSimilarly in Mumbai about 170,000 domestic, 500 commercial, and 40 industrial customers have \nbeen connected to natural gas supplies. In addition 51 CNG stations are catering to 46 buses, \n29,000 cars and taxis, and 40,000 scooters.  About $83 million has been spent on the project in \nMumbai. \n \n7.  The Project conforms with ADB\u2019s strategy for India. The strategy focuses on improving \nthe urban environment by providing cleaner fuels to domestic and commercial users, and \nswitching urban transport users to CNG. Part of ADB\u2019s energy policy is also to develop pipe \nnetworks for natural gas distribution. Without ADB, GAIL would have designed a straightforward \ngas transmission and supply project; ADB\u2019s involvement will ensure mitigation measures are \nincluded for people who may be adversely impacted by the Project. One of the essential aims of \nthe Project is to contribute to poverty reduction and ensure that the benefits reach women, \nchildren, and other disadvantaged people. The environmental impact assessment, detailed \npoverty  and  social  analysis,  and  comprehensive  consultations  with  stakeholders  and \nbeneficiaries will assist the Project to serve the needs of the beneficiaries and adhere to ADB \nand Government requirements. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The purpose of the TA is to carry out a study for implementing a clean fuel project, with \ncomponents in six cities, namely, Agra, Faridabad, Kanpur, Kolkata, Lucknow, and Pune, the \nproject will help to decrease the air pollution levels in these cities. Components of the Project \nidentified under the TA, will help to reduce emissions vehicular, indoor, and industrial sources, \nthus making a substantial contribution protecting the health of the residents of these cities, \nespecially the poor. Improved air quality will reduce the costs of pollution to society.  \n \n9.  The TA will develop a strategic plan on the use of CNG to improve urban air pollution, \nincluding an investment plan, to provide the required clean fuel supply. The plan might also \nprovide the initial stock of cleaner vehicles, so enough of them are available to attract private \nsector investments to increase the outreach of the Project.  To promote the required private \nsector involvement, the TA will study the conditions required for private sector participation and \nthe bulk use of natural gas/CNG. The plan will include the possibility of banning diesel buses \nand/or providing preferential pricing for CNG-powered vehicles and cooking gas (versus coal \nand wood). New investments to be included in the scope of  study under the Project will be \n(i) natural gas transmission lines, (ii) natural gas distribution network and connections to the \nnew CNG filling stations, (iii) CNG filling and storage stations, (iv) kits for converting gasoline \nengines to CNG, (v) new CNG-based buses, (vi) stations for monitoring the ambient air quality, \nand (vii) an inspection and maintenance system to ensure compliance with vehicle emission \nstandards.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will assess existing laws and policies relating to ambient air quality and vehicular \nand indoor pollution in India. It will also study the existing clean fuel projects in New Delhi and \nMumbai, and other ADB projects in Dhaka and Jakarta. By considering lessons learned from ", "4 \nthese projects, the TA will be able to suggest plans for using the least cost and effective \nimplementation mechanisms that are better than those used in the past.  \n \n11.  The key activities under the TA will include (i) reviewing the project viability for the \ndevelopment of a city gas distribution system; (ii) assessing the current demand and investment \nrequirements;  (iii)  formulating  a  strategy  for  implementing  the  Project;  (iv)  assessing  the \neconomic and environmental benefits resulting from improved air quality;  (v) identifying the \nchanges required in laws, policies, and rules governing the gas sector, and laws and policies \ngoverning supply of fuels to urban and industrial areas; (vi) an assessment of Environmental \nand Pollution Control Laws; (vii) prepare capital and operating cost estimates and work out the \nfinancial viability of the Project; (viii) carrying out the economic analysis for the CNG-natural gas \ndistribution; (ix) training staff involved in the establishment and operation of infrastructure and in \nregulatory agencies; (x) assess the impact of the proposed Project design on poverty alleviation, \nand women and children; (xi) conduct an assessment of land acquisition and resettlement \nimpacts;  (xii)  assessing  social  and  poverty  impacts,  including  any  impacts on indigenous \npeople;  (xiii)  consulting  with  stake  holder  and  analyzing  their  input;  (xiv)  conducting  an \naffordability  analysis  (disaggregated  by  consumer  groups);  and  (xv)  carrying  out  an \nenvironmental assessment. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.250 million equivalent, comprising $ 755,000 \nin foreign exchange costs and $495,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The entire amount of \n$755,000  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $240,000  equivalent  of  local  currency  costs  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis from the United Kingdom Cooperation Fund (poverty-focused) for \nTechnical Assistance funded by the Government of the United Kingdom, established by ADB \nand the Department for International Development in July 2001. GAIL will finance the remaining  \n$255,000 equivalent of local currency costs in kind (para. 15). The Government and GAIL have \nbeen advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n13.  Any  computer  programs,  data  bases,  and  training  materials  developed  by  the \nconsultants during TA implementation will be provided to GAIL upon completion of the TA. The \nTA budget provides for surveys, vehicle rentals, workshops, and demonstration projects. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The TA will be carried out by a firm of international consultants with expertise in \n(i) energy economics and energy planning, (ii) gas infrastructure development and natural gas \ntransmission and marketing, (iii) transport economics and transport planning, (iv) environmental \nand safety issues related to CNG vehicles, (v) air quality monitoring and management, and \n(vi) social development and poverty reduction. Domestic consultants will be engaged by the \ninternational consulting firm, which will have the overall responsibility for the TA. The TA will \nrequire about 20 person-months of international and 57 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices to be provided by a firm. In addition, 4 person-months  of  individual  international \nconsultancy will be required for (i) stakeholder mobilization, and (ii) policy support for the air \nquality management dimension of the Project. An individual consultant will be needed in view of \nthe specialized skills required and to act as a liaison between implementing agency, Consultant \nand Project team. Consultants will be engaged by ADB using the simplified technical proposal \nprocedure and quality- and cost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants, and other arrangements satisfactory for the engagement of domestic \nconsultants. An international CNG and transport specialist will be the team leader and will ", "    5 \ncoordinate the activities of all the consultants, except that the individual consultant will report \ndirectly  to  the  ADB  team  leader.  The  domestic  consultants  will  assist  the  international \nconsultants in gathering and analyzing pertinent information and data, and in reviewing the \ndocuments provided by the concerned ministries and other agencies. The outline terms of \nreference of the consultants are provided in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  GAIL will be the Executing Agency for the TA. GAIL has set up a team of three senior \nstaff to manage and monitor the project.  GAIL will provide the consultants with adequate office \nspace  and  other  support  services.  The  consultants  will  hold  workshops  and  consultation \nmeetings to obtain inputs from various departments, state government bodies, and private \ngroups and NGOs. The consultants will develop workshop designs and identify participants in \nconsultation with the core group assigned by GAIL and focal points appointed by the city \ngovernments to ensure comprehensive participation. The TA will commence in November 2003, \nwill be implemented over a period of 8 months, and is expected to finish by June 2004. The \nconsultants will submit an inception report within 1 month, an interim report within 4 months, and \na draft final report within 6 months of the commencement of the TA. The draft final report will be \ndiscussed with the relevant ministries/organizations within the Government, concerned state \ngovernments, city authorities, ADB, and GAIL within 1 month of its issuance. The consultants \nwill submit the final report within 1 month after the meeting, incorporating the comments of all \ninvolved. The consultants will also design and organize two training courses for staff in GAIL \nand  other  relevant  agencies  involved  with  supporting  project  implementation,  including \npromotion of CNG/natural gas and the Project facilities. \n \n \nIV.
