THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The Proposal \n \n1.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) lending program in support of public management, \nthe  finance  sector,  and  trade  in  Southeast  Asia  is  expected  to  reach  $4.64  billion  during  \n2019\u20132021 from about $4.29 billion during 2016 2018.1 In addition to the expanded program size, \n\u2013\nthe ensuing programs and projects are becoming more complex in terms of reform areas and \nlending modalities. The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project \npreparatory  assistance,  including  policy  advice,  technical  support  and  inputs,  and  capacity \nbuilding2 to prepare the ensuing programs and projects. These programs cover a variety of areas \nincluding government reform programs to strengthen public financial management, to build \ndomestic  financial  sectors,  and  to  facilitate  increased  trade  in  ADB\u2019s  developing  member \ncountries (DMCs) in Southeast Asia.3 In addition, the TA facility will enable ADB to: strengthen its \nengagement with Southeast Asian DMCs\u2019 reform agendas, and to  shorten ADB\u2019s response times \nto address client requirements in the program and project preparation process.  \n \n2.  The TA facility contributes to ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 by addressing the remaining poverty \nand  reducing  inequalities  (operational  priority  1),  accelerating  progress  on  gender  equality \n(operational priority 2), strengthening governance and institutional capacity (operational priority 6), \nand fostering regional cooperation and integration (operational priority 7).4 The TA facility is \naligned with the findings and recommendations of ADB\u2019s evaluation of policy-based lending \nduring 2008\u201320175 that policy outcomes need to be further strengthened through substantive, \noutcome-oriented policy actions and designs that build upon ADB\u2019s engagement with reform \nagendas. \n \n2.  Development Challenges and Opportunities \n \n3.  Macroeconomic contexts. Southeast Asian DMCs have experienced remarkable growth \nand economic development since 2010. During 2010\u20132017, Southeast Asia\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) grew at an average 5.2% annually\u2015among the fastest-growing regions in the \nworld. GDP per capita nearly doubled from $2,716 in 2008 to $4,308 in 2017.6 The growth brought \nabout substantial poverty reduction and improved standards of living. The region\u2019s economic \nperformance has also been characterized by great dynamism. Indonesia and the Philippines are \namong  the  world\u2019s  fastest-growing  economies  and  have  become  domestic  demand-driven \nemerging markets. Malaysia, Thailand, and Viet Nam have established themselves as global \nmanufacturing  powerhouses.  Frontier  economies  such  as  Cambodia,  the  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, and Myanmar emerged from decades of central planning and have become \nintegral to regional trade and investment. \n \n4.  Good macroeconomic management and structural reforms have played a pivotal role in \nSoutheast Asia\u2019s economic performance. Since the Asian financial crisis in 1997, Southeast Asia \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Work Program and Budget Framework, 2019\u20132021.

The banking system was \nrestructured, financial regulations improved, and regulatory oversight strengthened. Fiscal policy \nhas become more prudent and targeted at achieving medium- to long-term national development \ngoals and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Industrial and trade policies have fostered \ninternational  trade  and  foreign  investment  and  improved  the  ease  of  doing  business. \nGovernments continue to tackle corruption and improve governance and institutions. As a result, \nfrom 2010 to 2018, the Global Competitiveness Index rankings of many Southeast Asian DMCs \nimproved, such as Indonesia (from 54th to 45th) and the Philippines (from 87th to 56th).7 \n \n5.  Development challenges. While sound economic fundamentals will continue to uphold \nan optimistic outlook, Southeast Asia\u2019s growth prospects are not preordained. The Gini coefficient, \na comprehensive gauge of economic inequality, is at an average of 42.0 and is the highest in Asia \nand the Pacific.8 Women remain behind in terms of labor force participation, poverty, financial \ninclusion,  entrepreneurship,  and  access  to  markets.  Openness  to  international  trade  and \ninvestment implies that the region is more exposed to external shocks. Climate change also \nmeans more frequent and severe natural disasters. These issues potentially undermine progress \ntoward poverty reduction and the SDGs. Policy reforms need to be strengthened to address the \nevolving development challenges and build resilience against emerging uncertainties. These \nchallenges include: (i) deepening capital markets to provide alternative sources of intermediation, \nand  increasing  financial  inclusion,  to  foster  equitable  growth;  (ii)  strengthening  public \nmanagement to improve service delivery; and (iii) expanding trade and competitiveness. \n \n6.  Deepening capital markets and financial inclusion. Since the Asian financial crisis, \nSoutheast Asian DMCs have made substantial progress in deepening capital markets. A variety \nof reforms have been implemented to encourage the use of domestic rather than international \nfinancial markets. Financial supervision, institutions, and regulations have been strengthened to \nmake the financial systems more resilient to financial shocks. Despite these advances, capital \nmarkets have not grown evenly throughout the region nor do they currently provide a significant \nsource of financing for infrastructure investments.9 Governments still rely on public funds and the \nbanking sector, which results in a maturity mismatch and potentially contributes to financial \ninstability.10 In addition, there is growing concern about financial inclusion. While large firms enjoy \nunfettered access to finance, small and medium-sized enterprises\u2015a key contributor to growth \nand employment\u2015experience limited access to finance and business opportunities, especially \namong businesses owned by women. \n \n7.  Strengthening public management and service delivery. Most Southeast Asian DMCs \nhave attained middle-income status and aspire to achieve high-income status by 2030. To \naccomplish this, governments will need to the ramp up the availability and quality of basic social \nservices and investments such as health care, education, access to digital technologies, and \nsocial protection systems. Therefore, governments will need not only to mobilize more tax and \nnontax revenues, but also to spend public revenues more effectively. However, tax revenue \nmobilization in Southeast Asian DMCs is low at about 12%\u201318% of GDP, compared with more \nthan 20% in middle-income countries in other regions and 30%\u201340% in advanced economies. \nThis is attributed to complex tax laws and exemptions; weak tax administration, especially in local \ngovernments; narrow tax bases; and costly tax compliance. Concurrently, the efficiency of public \n                                                \n7  World Economic Forum. 2018. Global Competitiveness Report 2018. Geneva. \n8  R. Kanbur, C. Rhee, and J.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nexpenditures has been plagued by a lack of medium- to long-term fiscal planning, budget \ngovernance and transparency, and international best practices for public procurement. \n \n8.  Expanding trade, industry, and competitiveness. Openness to trade and investment \nhas been a source of rapid industrialization and strengthened global competitiveness in Southeast \nAsia and will continue to be so. Southeast Asian DMCs need to push forward open trade policies \nand reduce entry barriers to foster a business environment that is conducive to fair competition. \nIn addition, concerns about skill mismatches are growing. Enterprises do not have a sufficient \npool of skilled workforce to innovate and stay competitive, and job seekers have difficulties finding \ndecent employment. Women in particular do not enjoy equitable access to business opportunities \nand jobs. Therefore, it will be increasingly important for the region to bring about reforms and skill \ndevelopment strategies that equip in-demand skills and facilitate employment, especially among \nwomen and youth. \n \n3.  Technical Assistance Facility Outcomes \n \n9.  The TA facility will support the preparation of the ensuing programs and projects and \nimprove the performance of ADB\u2019s operations by: (i) strengthening the substance of policy actions \nand  policy  designs;  (ii)  improving  the  timeliness  of  ADB\u2019s  responses  to  DMCs\u2019  requests; \n(iii) enhancing ADB\u2019s engagement and its value addition to the programs and projects; and  \n(iv) exploring innovative financial products and new reform areas to address DMCs\u2019 evolving \ndevelopment challenges. In addition, the TA will ensure that ADB\u2019s programs and projects are \nunderpinned  by  in-depth  analytical  work  and  diagnostics.  The  TA  facility  is  aligned  with \noperational priorities 1\u20132 and 6\u20137 of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 in terms of poverty reduction, gender \nequality, strengthening governance and institutional capacity, and fostering regional cooperation \nand integration. It will directly contribute to SDGs 1, 5, 8\u201312, and 16\u201317. It catalyzes resources \nand synergies to support program and project preparation through, policy advisory services, and \nrelated policy support activities. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Capital market and financial inclusion reforms supported. The TA facility \nwill support the preparation of programs and projects that create an enabling environment to \nsupport capital market development, enhance finance sector resilience and diversification and \nincrease access to finance. In Indonesia (project 1), the TA facility will support activities that \nincrease access to finance broadly, and specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises, \nincluding woman entrepreneurs. In the Philippines (project 3), the TA facility will support activities \nthat  lead  to  an  increase  in  intermediation  through  the  nonbank  financial  sector,  including  \nlong-term finance to fund infrastructure. While the specific activities to be supported will be \ndeveloped over time in consultation with the respective governments, this output will support the \nfollowing thematic areas: (i) increase intermediation from the nonbank sectors; (ii) encourage \npublic and private financing of infrastructure and social assistance through domestic capital \nmarkets; (iii) improve market surveillance and investor protection; (iv) promote the issuance of \nnew and innovative financial instruments; (v) foster financial inclusion; and (vi) explore high-\nimpact, innovative finance initiatives (e.g., disaster risk insurance pools and low-cost housing \ncredit guarantees). \n  \n11.  Output 2: Public finance management reforms supported. This output will support the \npreparation of programs and projects that enable governments to maintain sound fiscal positions \nand deliver social services effectively to achieve medium-term national development goals and \nthe SDGs. In the Philippines (project 4), the TA will enable inclusive growth by increasing budget \n ", "4 \nefficiency and improving service delivery at the local level. In the Lao People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic (project 5), the TA will improve public debt and expenditure management. Specific \nactivities to be supported will depend on the reform programs of the respective governments, but \nwill focus on the following areas: (i) improving public debt management; (ii) strengthening tax \npolicies and administration, including gender analysis; (iii) improving medium-term fiscal planning \nand  budgeting  with  sex-disaggregated  data;  (iv)  aligning  public  expenditures  with  SDGs;  \n(v) supporting local public service delivery; and (vi) promoting governance in public expenditure. \nGender  equity  will  be  enhanced  through  gender-responsive  budgeting,11 human  resources \ndevelopment for women in the public sector, and more targeted budget allocations to priority \nsocial sectors. \n \n12.  Output 3: Trade, industrial, and competitiveness policies supported. The TA facility \nwill support the preparation of programs and projects that help governments design and develop \nmodern trade and industrial policies, skills development, and employment facilitation strategies. \nIn Indonesia (project 6), the TA will improve the nation\u2019s competitiveness, and (project 7) reduce \ninequality and productivity by improving access to employment. This output will support project \npreparation activities in the following areas: (i) developing pro-growth enabling environments; \n(ii) facilitating cross-border trade and investment; (iii) improving the ease of doing business and \nreducing transaction costs; (iv) fostering fair competition through strong institution and legal \nframeworks; (v) maintaining a skilled workforce and improving employment facilitation services; \nand (vi) developing modern industrial policies in the era of the fourth industrial revolution. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $3,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) ($400,000 from TASF 6 and $2,600,000 from \nTASF-other sources). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The scope of the TA \nfacility may be expanded to cover additional activities, consistent with the outputs and outcome \nand be replenished from time to time as funds are required and identified.12 Governments will be \ninformed that approval of the TA facility does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. The TA activities for the ensuing projects will start only after \nthe ensuing project is included in the country operations business plan for the relevant country. \nThe TA facility is categorized complex because most of the ensuing projects are categorized \ncomplex. Southeast Asia Department\u2019s Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade (SEPF) \nDivision will select, administer, and evaluate consultants. Framework agreements will be used to \nensure the timely mobilization of the firm or individual experts required by Southeast Asian \nDMCs.13 Single-source selection of firms or individuals will be used on a case-by-case basis for \nspecialized fields of expertise not included in the framework agreements. The SEPF Division will \nmaintain  regular  contact  with  governments  and  consultants  to  ensure  that  work  proceeds \naccording to agreed schedules and expected outputs. \n \n15.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1. \n \n                                                \n11 Two aspects of the gender-responsive budgeting will be supported: (i) training and awareness raising among \ngovernment officials; and (ii) implementation among the ministries relevant to budget planning and preparation. \n12 The indicative total TA resource needs for the 3-year period (2019\u20132021) are $9,000,000. \n13 For firm engagement, up to three firms will be empaneled based on a closed framework agreement. For individual \nconsultant engagement, an open framework agreement will be used to allow for the possibility of adding new experts. \n ", "5 \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  July 2019\u2013June 2022  \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  Southeast Asia Department; Public Management, Financial \nSector, and Trade Division \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Firm: Framework  International:   $1,500,000 \nagreement  40 person-months \nNational: 20 person-\nmonths \n  Individual:  International:   $750,000 \nFramework  15 person-months \nagreement  National: 40 person-\nmonths \n  Firm or individual:  International:  $750,000 \nDirect selection  15 person-months \nNational: 40 person-\nmonths \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Not applicable \narrangement upon TA completion \nADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n16.

National  specialists  will  be  recruited  to  complement  the \ninternational expertise and ensure adequate knowledge of local conditions and regulations. \nProcurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nProcurement  Regulations  for  ADB  Borrowers  (2017,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nE.  Governance \n \n17.  ADB is the executing agency. So, the financial management, procurement, and integrity \nrisks during implementation are assessed to be low. However, the TA facility will conduct thorough \nrisk assessments of governance subjects as required for the ensuing projects. \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \n \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 on a grant basis for\nthe Southeast Asia Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Policy Facility, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem           Amount \nAsian Development Banka   \n1.
