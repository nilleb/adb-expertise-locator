THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to The University of the South Pacific (USP) for the Higher \nEducation in the Pacific Investment Program.1 \n \n2.  The proposed investment program will support USP in expanding access to higher \neducation in its 12 member Pacific island countries (PICs) by improving physical environments \nand learning programs.2 The investment program will include (i) expanding regional campuses \nand accommodation facilities in Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Fiji; (ii) enhancing information \nand communication technology (ICT)-based distance learning programs; (iii) improving student \nservices; and (iv) strengthening USP governance and management capacity. Improved access \nto quality higher education at USP will contribute to human resource and skills development in \nthe Pacific and will promote inclusive growth enabled by higher productivity and diversification of \nthe region\u2019s economy.3 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  Pacific  region  shares  common  challenges  for  sustainable  development  due  to \ngeographic remoteness, small domestic markets, and a narrow industrial base. Building resilient \nand  sustainable  economies  requires  a  strong  workforce  with  required  technical  skills  and \nmanagerial competencies. Currently, many countries in the region face shortages of trained \nprofessionals and technical personnel, who can adopt new technologies, drive innovation, and \nmanage business and government effectively. Of the total population of 2.3 million in the 12 \nPICs, more than half are under the age of 25. If adequately educated and trained, they can \nbecome critical drivers of sustainable development in the Pacific. Research indicates that higher \neducation  in  developing  countries  not  only  increases  individual  productivity  and  earnings \npotential, but it produces a professional work force, creates entrepreneurial activities with a \ngreater number of jobs, and strengthens governance, thereby leading to poverty reduction and \neconomic development.4     \n \n4.  Limited higher education opportunities. In the Pacific, the gross enrollment ratio for \nhigher education ranges from 10% in Fiji to 2%\u20135% in most other PICs.5 Low enrollment is \nattributable to several factors. Physical capacities and program coverage in higher education in \nthe region are limited. Many potential employers perceive that the quality of higher education \nprograms available in the Pacific is not sufficient to provide graduates with the relevant skills \nand competencies required in the labor market. Therefore, students seek opportunities to attend \nhigher education outside the region, such as in Australia and New Zealand. Such education is \nunaffordable  for  most  students,  especially  those  from  low-income  households;  only  5%  of \nstudents  seeking  an  overseas  education  can  obtain  government  scholarships  or  private \nsponsorship.  \n \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The 12 USP member countries are the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Samoa, Solomon \nIslands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Of these countries, Niue and Tokelau are not member countries of \nthe Asian Development Bank; these are small island countries with a combined total population of 2,800. Niue had \n57 students and Tokelau had 79 students enrolled at USP in 2011. \n3  ADB. 2009.

", "2 \n \n5.  Region\u2019s objectives for higher education. The Pacific Plan\u2014the region\u2019s high-level \nstrategy endorsed by Pacific Island Forum leaders in 2005\u2014regards an educated population as \na prerequisite to achieving the common goals of economic growth, sustainable development, \ngood governance, and security. The plan emphasizes strengthening regional cooperation and \nintegration to achieve these common goals and identifies the regional provision of public goods \nand services as an important area of regional cooperation. Services, such as higher education, \nthat are costly and inefficient for small island countries to provide at the national level will benefit \nfrom regional cooperation through economies of scale.  In this regard, USP is expected to play a \nleading  role  in  the  region\u2019s  collective  commitment  to  improve  access  to  quality  higher \neducation.6   \n \n6.  USP\u2019s regional leadership. USP was established in 1968 by the governments of 12 \nPICs to meet the regional challenges of higher education.7 USP\u2019s regional role is demonstrated \nby its 14 campuses across the 12 PICs, its student composition, governance, and approaches \nto education delivery. The USP council, currently chaired by Samoa, is the highest decision-\nmaking and governing body of USP and comprises 35 members from the 12 PICs, Australia, \nNew Zealand, and the Pacific Island Forum Secretariat. USP\u2019s main campus, located in Suva, \nFiji (Laucala campus), hosts the recently established Japan\u2013Pacific ICT Center, which will \ncoordinate and broadcast ICT-based distance and flexible learning (DFL) programs across the \n12 member countries.   \n \n7.  In 2011, approximately 22,000 students were enrolled in USP\u2019s predegree or degree \nprograms  across the member countries,  which  was  an  increase  of  10% from  2010. Total \nenrollment is expected to increase further by 16% in 2012. Although precise estimates are not \navailable, more than three-quarters of all higher education students across the 12 PICs are \nenrolled in USP. Students from Solomon Islands and Vanuatu constitute the second largest \nshares of USP enrollment (12% of total each), next to those from Fiji; students from Kiribati and \nTonga make up the next largest groups (4% of total each). Despite increases in enrollment from \nthese countries, attendees still represent only a small proportion of those in the 17\u201322 age \ngroup. As secondary enrollment has been increasing, there is growing demand for higher \neducation, but the USP regional campuses, such as in Kiribati and Solomon Islands, are limited \nin physical capacities and academic programs. ICT-based DFL programs with a high degree of \nflexibility will enable USP to reach out to remote parts of the Pacific and to those who cannot \nafford full-time studies. Currently, about 40% of USP students study through DFL programs. \n \n8.  Regional road map for higher education.8  To achieve the regional vision of the \nPacific Plan and to meet changing global and regional needs, USP has initiated a range of \nreforms. The USP Strategic Plan 2010\u20132012: Quality, Relevance, and Sustainability has been \nimplemented to enhance the quality and relevance of learning and teaching programs.9 The \nnew strategic plan for 2013\u20132018 aims to further reshape the strategic focus of USP, while \nexpanding its provision of quality higher education across the region. These strategic plans, \ntogether with the Pacific Plan, represent the regional road map for higher education. The \n                                                \n6  USP is a member of the Council of Regional Organization of the Pacific, which is the highest technical advisory \nbody responsible for facilitating the implementation of the Pacific Plan.  \n7  USP is a regional entity established by order of the Queen of Great Britain and the Commonwealth under the \nprerogative powers of the British Crown. Amendments to the USP charter are approved by the Privy Council. \nExpert review of USP\u2019s charter and statues concluded that USP may legally borrow money. Details of USP\u2019s legal \nand governance structure are provided in Summary Description of Legal Status of the University of the South \nPacific (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). A legal opinion from USP\u2019s counsel,  \nsatisfactory to ADB, will be submitted as a condition for loan effectiveness. \n8  The regional road map for higher education is included in the Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from \nthe list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9   The University  of  the  South Pacific. 2010.

Policy  support  at  the  national  level.  National  development  strategies  in  PICs \nrecognize the importance of education for inclusive and sustainable development. For example, \nthe  draft  Kiribati  Development  Plan  2012\u20132015  identifies  limited  opportunities  for  higher \neducation and training as a major constraint to increasing economic productivity, and prioritizes \nits commitment to enhance the relevance of higher education to local and overseas employment. \nKiribati has been urging USP to expand its local campus and extend undergraduate programs to \npermit Kiribati students to complete undergraduate studies in-country. Similarly, the National \nDevelopment  Strategy  2011\u20132020  for  Solomon  Islands  emphasizes  improved  access  to \neducation as an essential requirement for reducing poverty and improving the lives of Solomon \nIslanders. Recognizing the high costs of overseas education, the Government of Solomon \nIslands views the development of in-country training as a more cost-effective option over the \nlong term, and has proposed the establishment of a full USP campus in Solomon Islands that \nwill make an optimal use of technology to facilitate online and DFL programs. \n \n10.  ADB\u2019s strategic context. Aligned with the Pacific Plan and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020,10 \nADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014 sets regional cooperation and integration as a priority goal, \nalong with inclusive and sustainable growth and good governance.11 This investment program is \nconsistent with the direction of ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach. It represents ADB\u2019s first investment \nsupport for higher education at the regional level in the Pacific, building on past engagements in \nthe  education  and  training  sector  through  regional  technical  assistance  and  capacity \ndevelopment activities. ADB support will also complement the activities of other development \npartners supporting USP, such as the Australian Agency for International Development, the \nEuropean Union, the Government of India, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the \nNew Zealand Aid Programme.12  \n \n11.  By supporting USP\u2019s regional role in the provision of higher education, ADB will promote \nregional  integration  activities  in  the  Pacific  while  helping  PIC  governments  free  up  limited \nresources for investments in primary and secondary education. Enabling USP to expand the \nhighly skilled work force will contribute to human resource development in the region, which can \nfoster a private sector-driven economy, advance the business environment, and strengthen \ngovernance. Supporting USP\u2019s ICT-based DFL programs will also reinforce ADB\u2019s regional \nstrategy of enhancing connectivity and social service delivery through ongoing ICT investments. \n \n12.  Financing modality. An MFF is proposed as the financing modality, consisting of three \ntranches to be implemented over 8 years. The MFF modality is proposed, as it (i) provides long-\nterm support to USP for the phased implementation of individual projects based on project \nreadiness,  (ii)  allows  for  timely  arrangements  of  the  required  sovereign  guarantees  for \nsubsequent tranches, and (iii) aligns ADB support with assistance provided to USP by other \ndevelopment partners.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The expected impact of the investment program is that USP graduates will contribute to \nthe competitiveness and diversification of PIC economies. The expected outcome is expanded \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2008.

Outputs \n14.  The overall investment program has five outputs: (i) output 1: strengthened regional \ncampuses of USP, (ii) output 2: enhanced ICT-based education, (iii) output 3: improved USP \nstudent services, (iv) output 4: strengthened USP governance and management, and (v) output \n5: strengthened project management capacity of USP.  \n \n15.  Tranche 1 will support outputs 1, 2, 4, and 5, with the following major activities: \n \n(i)  Enhanced regional campus and ICT-based education in Kiribati. The USP \nKiribati campus will be expanded to accommodate the rapidly increasing number \nof  students  by  constructing  additional  classrooms,  an  ICT  studio,  a  student \ncafeteria, and administration facilities. New ICT equipment will be provided to \nconnect to other regional campuses, and deliver faster and more reliable ICT-\nbased learning courses, especially DFL courses. \n \n(ii)  Strengthened  USP  governance  and  management.  The  education \nmanagement information system will be enhanced by collecting, analyzing, and \ndisseminating  accurate and  timely  statistical  data  about  USP\u2019s  activities  and \nhuman  resources  (e.g.,  student,  faculty,  and  alumni  data)  to  support  USP \nmanagement and operations. All data will be disaggregated by sex. \n \n(iii)  Strengthened project management capacity. Project management capacity \nwill be supported by establishing a project implementation unit (PIU) within USP, \nwhich  will  manage  all  project  activities  (e.g.,  procurement,  accounting,  and \nmonitoring). \n \n16.  Subsequent tranches will support activities under outputs 1\u20135 with a focus on expanding \nthe Solomon Islands campus and enhancing student support services. The USP Solomon \nIslands campus will be expanded and upgraded with additional classrooms, an ICT studio, \nscience laboratories, dormitories, and faculty offices. The upgraded facilities will be provided \nwith ICT equipment allowing students to learn through face-to-face, DFL, or blended methods. \nAdditional e-learning materials will be produced and ICT connectivity improved to make a wide \nrange of courses available for students across USP regional campuses. \n \n17.  To improve student support services, pre-enrollment services will focus on providing \naccurate information about curricular choice. Career counseling services will be established to \nfacilitate  skills  assessments,  job  search  processes,  and  links  to  available  employment \nopportunities. A new dormitory will be constructed at the Laucala main campus to accommodate \nregional students at the degree or graduate levels, especially female students with families. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n18.  The investment program is estimated to cost $23 million, including taxes and duties of \n$1 million (Table 1).  USP has requested an MFF in an amount up to $19 million equivalent from \nSpecial Funds resources with a third party sovereign guarantee to help finance part of the \ninvestment program. The MFF will consist of three tranches, subject to USP\u2019s submission of \nrelated periodic financing requests (PFRs); availability of a sovereign guarantee; execution of \nthe  related  loan  agreement  for  each  tranche;  and  fulfillment  of  terms,  conditions,  and \nundertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement (FFA).13 Tranche 1 will have a 32-\n                                                \n13 Framework Financing Agreement (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Tranche 1. USP submitted the first PFR14 in line with the FFA. The tranche 1 project is \nestimated to cost $3.975 million equivalent, including taxes and duties of $300,000, physical \nand price contingencies, and interest charges during implementation. The PFR is for a loan in \nvarious currencies equivalent to SDR 1,692,000 from ADF resources to finance 65.5% of the \ntotal cost of the project.15 USP will provide counterpart financing of $0.375 million and the \nGovernment of Kiribati $1 million. \n \n20.  As a financing facility to a regional entity comprising ADB\u2019s Pacific developing member \ncountries  (DMCs)  and  other  members,  and  guaranteed  by  ADB  members,  the  proposed \nfinancing is classified as public sector financing. Direct lending to USP is consistent with the \nAgreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank (the Charter), which specifies that ADB \nmay  finance  international  or  regional  agencies  or  entities  concerned  with  economic \ndevelopment of the region, as well as with ADF regulations.16 USP is a regional entity that will \ndirectly contribute to the economic development of the Pacific region. The investment program\u2019s \nregional design and impact aim to benefit students particularly from economically vulnerable \nADF-eligible DMCs for an education sector intervention with high developmental priority.17  \n \n21.  The loan for the tranche 1 project requires a sovereign guarantee; the Government of \nKiribati has agreed to serve as a guarantor. ADB is in discussion with other Pacific DMCs and \nADB member countries to seek similar guarantee arrangements for subsequent tranches. USP \nwill provide counterpart financing of $2 million equivalent for the entire program. \n \n22.  Framework financing agreement. USP and the Government of Kiribati (as sovereign \nguarantor)  have  entered  into  an  FFA  with  ADB  that  includes  comprehensive  assurances, \nwarranties, and representations in relation to safeguards, governance, anticorruption, financial \nmanagement, procurement, and disbursement. As a condition to ADB accepting to act upon any \nPFR for tranche 1, the Government of Kiribati will ensure full compliance with the terms and \nconditions of the FFA.  \n \n23.  USP  has  requested  ADB  to  consider  providing  additional  resources  from  its  ADF \nresources for subsequent tranches. Any additional ADF allocation will be subject to the general \navailability of ADF resources from time to time. Tranche 2, which will support expansion of the \nUSP campus located in Solomon Islands, along with other project activities, is estimated to cost  \n$15.78 million with proposed ADF financing of approximately $13.55 million. Tranche 3, which \nwill support establishment of a dormitory for regional students at the Laucala main campus of \nUSP, will cost a total of $3.25 million with proposed ADF financing of $2.85 million.18   \n \n                                                \n14 Periodic Financing Request for Tranche 1 (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n15 ADB financing may cover transportation, insurance, and bank charges under tranche 1 and subsequent tranches. \n16 ADB. 1966.

Regulations of the Asian Development Fund. \nManila (Section 3.02: Eligible Recipients). \n17  ADB  policies  on  classification  and  graduation  of  developing  member  countries  and  on  performance-based \nallocation of ADF resources provide the eligibility criteria for ADF financing based on country-by-country economic \ndata, which would not be available for a regional entity borrower such as USP. The criteria under the performance-\nbased allocation policy for allocations from the regional pool do not address, but do not explicitly exclude, \nborrowers that are international or regional entities rather than countries, while requiring a demonstration of \n\u201ccountry ownership.\u201d In strong demonstration of country ownership, the governments of Kiribati and Solomon \nIslands have agreed to contribute $1 million each to cover taxes and duties, together with land contribution for the \nexpansion of USP campuses, although they are not recipients of the loan. USP will contribute $2 million, reflecting \nthe commitment of its broader membership in the investment program. ADB has informally consulted with ADF \ndonor members regarding the use of ADF funding for the proposed financing.  \n18 Tranche 3 will be conditional on the consideration of applicable ADB policies on ADF availability and other policies \nat the time of the request, as well as the availability of a sovereign guarantee at that time, and may take into \naccount the possibility of cofinancing or additional financing if suitable. ", "7 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  USP will be the executing agency. A project steering committee (PSC) will provide \noverall guidance for project implementation and facilitate cross-agency dialogue. The PSC will \nbe  chaired  by  the  USP  vice-chancellor  and  include  representatives  from  USP  member \ncountries. A PIU will be created within USP\u2019s Development, Marketing, and Communications \nDivision  with  responsibility  for  day-to-day  implementation  of  all  project  activities,  including \nprocurement, civil works, finance, and contract management. The implementation arrangements \nare summarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the facility administration manual.19  \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  July 2012\u2013 December 2019 \nEstimated completion date  Physical completion of the multitranche financing facility will be on  \n31 December 2019.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n25.  The investment program will fund the construction of additional facilities at the USP \nKiribati campus in Tarawa, the expansion of the USP Solomon Islands campus in a new \nlocation in Honiara, and the construction of a dormitory at the existing USP Laucala campus. \nThe Kiribati campus in Tarawa will be constructed on the existing USP site, which is located on \ngovernment-owned  land.  For  tranche  2,  the  Government  of  Solomon  Islands  will  provide \nassurance that the new campus site in Honiara is government-owned land, with valid legal title, \nfree from all encumbrances and controversies. The projects under the investment program will \nseek international firms to manage the design, construction, and equipping of the new facilities. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n26.  The economic and financial analyses show that the investment program will satisfy \nADB\u2019s economic and financial evaluation criteria, and that the tranche 1 project would have an \neconomic internal rate of return of 15.7% and a financial internal rate of return of 12.3%.20  \n \n                                                \n19 Facility Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \n \n27.  With the 2009 appointment of the current vice-chancellor who put forward the Strategic \nPlan  2010\u20132012,  USP\u2019s  financial  position  has  improved  significantly  in  recent  years.  The \nimprovement  resulted  from  rigorous  restructuring  efforts  that  included  payroll  cuts,  faculty \nconsolidation, and expansion and enhancement of revenue generating opportunities on USP \ncampuses. The  stronger financial  position  and  managerial  capacity  has,  in  turn,  prompted \nincreased  support  from  bilateral  development  partners.  Audited  financial  accounts  show \noperating surplus equivalent to about $3.4 million for 2008, $8.2 million for 2009, and $2.5 \nmillion for 2010. These surpluses represented 4.0%, 12.4%, and 3.4% of total operating income \nfor these 3 years, which contrasts with operating deficits earlier in the decade. The positive \nfinancial outcomes are expected to continue, with USP\u2019s operating surplus for 2011 estimated at \n$3.5 million. \n \n28.  Economic benefits of the tranche 1 project derive mainly from increased employment \nand higher salaries commanded by USP graduates compared with the labor market outcomes \nexpected for Kiribati youths without undergraduate education. Project economic benefits include \nan estimated value of positive externalities to Kiribati society from having a more educated \npopulation (e.g., more entrepreneurial activity, improved civil engagement, better public health \noutcomes), which is assumed modestly at 5% of the value of higher earnings. Records show a \nhigh attrition rate for Kiribati students at USP. This has been improving, and the analysis \nassumes that the upgrading of the USP Kiribati campus will reduce attrition rates modestly by \n4.5%.21 The actual campus upgrading is expected to bring more significant improvements in \nstudent completion rates, and hence the economic internal rate of return would be much higher. \n  \n29.  An assessment of USP\u2019s financial management capacity concluded that current financial \ncontrol mechanisms are robust and procurement capacity is adequate. For the investment \nprogram, a dedicated PIU, which will include a financial specialist, will be established within \nUSP\u2019s Development, Marketing, and Communications Division. The PIU will oversee technical, \nprocurement, and disbursement processes. ADB will provide capacity-building support to the \nPIU to ensure that all financial reporting and procurement procedures are in compliance with \nADB guidelines and procedures. \n \nC.  Governance \n30.  As the only regional higher education institution in the Pacific, USP is expected to \nprovide a model for good practice in governance and to operate ethical, transparent, and \neffective systems. In 2009, the USP council and management decided that a comprehensive \ngovernance and management enhancement strategy was required to position USP to meet the \noverarching goals in the Pacific. This view was translated into the strategic plans for 2010\u20132012 \nand 2013\u20132018, one priority of which is to \u201cincrease effectiveness of governance, administrative, \nand management systems.\u201d The investment program directly supports this priority as indicated \nin the road map. The appointment of a new vice-chancellor in 2009 also saw a marked shift in \nUSP direction and performance. The work of the USP governance committee was accelerated, \nand significant improvements were made in transparency, due diligence, and risk management. \n \n31.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith USP. An assessment of procurement capacity found that USP has a robust procurement \nsystem, knowledgeable staff, and clear guidelines. Additional support for capacity development \nwill ensure compliance with ADB guidelines and procedures. \n \n                                                \n21 Assumptions about graduation and employment rates of Kiribati students at USP are based on reported graduation \nrates in 2009 and 2010, and the results of the USP graduate destination surveys for 2009\u20132010 and 2011. ", "9 \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  The  expansion  of  USP  campuses  in  Kiribati  and  Solomon  Islands,  together  with \nextensive  outreach  activities,  will  allow  more  equitable  opportunities  for  higher  education, \nespecially for young people from poor and disadvantaged backgrounds. Higher education for \nthese young people will, in turn, improve their employment and earnings potential, providing \nthem with a greater ability to enhance economic conditions and social mobility. These individual \nbenefits will cumulate into improved quality of life in the region. The improved quality of the USP \nacademic programs will also increase the pool of qualified individuals who contribute to inclusive \neconomic  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in  the  region.  Recent  evidence  suggests  that \ninvestment in higher education produces both private and public benefits, such as improved \nhealth  status,  reduced  population  growth,  use  of  innovative  technology,  and  strengthened \ngovernance (footnote 4). Improved quality of higher education will also enable Pacific islanders \nto find overseas employment, and contribute to the home economy with remittances or by \nreturning to home countries with advanced knowledge and better entrepreneurial skills. \n \n33.  The tranche 1 project is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. To address \ngender-specific concerns in the project, a gender action plan was prepared for the investment \nprogram and for tranche 1. The plan for tranche 1 will promote increased enrollment for women \n(as well as men) in the USP Kiribati campus, especially in degree programs and e-learning DFL \nprograms. The target is for at least 30% of all registered female students in the Kiribati campus \nto be enrolled in degree programs by 2018. The project will also promote the participation of \nfemale staff in all USP management committees. During the construction of new facilities, \nemployment opportunities will be provided for women as well as men.  \n \nE.  Safeguards \n34.  Environment. The tranche 1 project is classified as category B in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). An initial environmental examination was prepared \nto assess and review the process for project implementation.22 Civil works under tranche 1 may \nhave  minor  adverse  environmental  impacts  such  as  noise  and  traffic  congestion  during \nconstruction. Measures to mitigate such impacts and monitoring and compliance tasks are \noutlined in the initial environmental examination in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement and all applicable environmental laws and regulations of Kiribati.  \n \n35.  Social safeguards. The tranche 1 project is classified as category C for both involuntary \nresettlement and indigenous peoples in accordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nThe project does not involve land acquisition or involuntary resettlement impacts. All civil works \nwill be undertaken on land currently being used by USP or on land provided by the government \nfree of any claims or encumbrances. The project is not expected to affect any distinct and \nvulnerable groups of indigenous peoples as defined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.23 \n                                                \n22 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n23  Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nUSP decides not to continue its  The proposed tranche projects under the investment program have already \nreform efforts outlined in the strategic  been approved by the USP council.

ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n37.  USP has assured ADB that implementation of the project will conform to all applicable \nADB  policies,  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures,  safeguards,  gender, \nprocurement,  consulting  services,  and  disbursement  as  described  in  detail  in  the  facility \nadministration manual and the loan documents. USP and the Government of Kiribati have given \nADB certain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific covenants \nagreed to by USP with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan \nagreement for the respective tranches. In addition, USP has agreed to the following specific \nassurances  with  respect  to  tranche  1,  which  will  be  conditions  for  loan  effectiveness:  \n(i) agreement with the Government of Kiribati on a sovereign guarantee for tranche 1; and (ii) a \nproject facilitation letter from the Government of Kiribati that assures land lease rights, in-kind \ncontributions  for  taxes  and  duties,  and  safeguard  compliance.  Finalization  of  a  site  lease \nbetween the Government of Kiribati and USP for the Kiribati campus where civil works are to be \nundertaken will be a condition for disbursement of the tranche 1 loan proceeds for such civil \nworks. \n   \nV.
