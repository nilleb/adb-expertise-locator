INTRODUCTION \n1.  In June 2006, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the United Nations Children's Fund \n(UNICEF),1 and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)2 agreed to jointly \ndevelop a regional HIV and AIDS data hub for Asia and the Pacific.3 The data hub is financed \nby ADB under a regional technical assistance (TA) for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the \nPacific4 and by the UNICEF East Asia Pacific Regional Office (EAPRO). The regional HIV and \nAIDS data hub was officially launched on World AIDS Day, 1 December 2008.5 \n \n2.  By July 2009, the data hub had recorded more than 56,000 hits. The data hub has now \nbeen functioning for a year and other UNAIDS regions have expressed interest in developing \nsimilar regional data hubs.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  HIV epidemics vary considerably from country to country, depending on the social, \ncultural,  and  economic  context,  and  continue  to  evolve.  In  Asia,  the  main  drivers  of  the \nepidemic\u2014unprotected  paid  sex,  sharing  of  contaminated  needles  and  syringes,  and \nunprotected sex between men\u2014put those involved in these risky behaviors, as well as their \nspouses and partners, at risk.6 Importantly, epidemiological models show that the characteristics \nof  HIV  epidemics  and  resources  in  Asia  make  it  possible  for  Asia  to  achieve  Millennium \nDevelopment Goal 6, Target 7 by 2015: To have halted and begun to reverse the spread of \nHIV/AIDS. But to achieve this, countries must allocate resources for the most cost-effective \ninterventions, targeting groups that are most at risk and, locally, are driving the epidemics. \n \n4.  Like other communicable diseases, HIV does not recognize borders. With improved \nconnectivity and enhanced regional cooperation offering new job opportunities, new complex \npatterns  of  internal  and  cross-border  migration  occur,  creating  new  risks  along  transport \ncorridors  and  in  cross-border  areas.  Conducting  joint  cross-border  monitoring,  sharing \nevidence-based good practices, and building cooperation among neighbors to respond to the \nthreat and fight the spread of HIV and AIDS will benefit everyone: it is a regional public good. \n \n5.  Responding  effectively  and  efficiently  to  local  HIV  epidemics  requires  up-to-date, \naccurate, and quality-assured information. The objective of the regional AIDS data hub is to \nprovide strategic information for national program improvement, taking into consideration the \nregional  context  and  what  is  happening  in  neighboring  countries.  The  data  hub  aims  to \nstrengthen data collection and analyses on HIV epidemics in the region (national and regional \nanalyses), and to facilitate comparison and exchange of information in the region. The data hub \ncovers 26 countries of Asia and the Pacific and contains the latest HIV and AIDS statistics and \ninternationally accepted standardized indicators for monitoring HIV interventions. The data hub \nhelps countries keep track of their epidemics and risk profiles in the regional context. It helps \nthem determine which interventions should be prioritized and how to strengthen partnerships \n                                                 \n1  The East Asia Pacific Regional Office of UNICEF, based in Bangkok. \n2  The UNAIDS Regional Support Team for Asia and the Pacific, based in Bangkok, and World Health Organization \nregional offices for the Western Pacific and for Southeast Asia are collaborating in the project. \n3  HIV and AIDS Data Hub for Asia-Pacific: Evidence to Action. http://www.aidsdatahub.org \n4  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific. Manila (TA 6321-REG). The \ntechnical assistance comprises 12 subprojects. The development of the data hub was a $500,000 component of \nthe $2,850,000 ADB\u2013UNAIDS joint subproject, evidence-based advocacy. \n5   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 7 April 2010. \n6  Commission on AIDS in Asia. 2008. Redefining AIDS in Asia. Oxford University Press. \n ", "2 \nwith nongovernment and community organizations. With this online resource, countries are in a \nbetter situation to design and implement cost-effective interventions. \n \n6.  The regional AIDS data hub is managed by a team of experts, located in Bangkok, who \nreport to UNICEF EAPRO, under the supervision of a steering committee comprising ADB, \nUNAIDS, and UNICEF representatives. A scientific technical advisory group (STAG), including \nmultidisciplinary HIV and AIDS epidemiologists and public health experts, provides technical \nguidance and accredits the process of data collection and analysis. \n \n7.  The joint ADB\u2013UNAIDS\u2013UNICEF project provided the necessary resources to develop \nthe  data  hub  and  assess  if  the  provided  services  would  be  appreciated  by  the  intended \nbeneficiaries. With the positive initial response, as reflected by the number of hits and informal \ndiscussions with national AIDS committees, the data hub is proving to be a useful resource for \nplanners and decision-makers. However, new financing resources are needed to maintain the \nfunctioning of the data hub. After discussions, the partners agreed that additional resources \nwould be mobilized on a short-term basis to consolidate results achieved from the first phase. \nThey also agreed that new options and financing mechanisms will be explored and a plan \ndeveloped to ensure long-term sustainability of the data hub. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  project  will  contribute  to  achieving  Millennium  Development  Goal  6  by  using \nstrategic information to develop and implement cost-effective national and regional responses to \nHIV  epidemics.  The  objectives  are  to  (i)  consolidate  results  and  build  on  the  successful \nexperiences  and  institutional  structures  established  during  the  first  phase,  and  (ii)  identify \nsustainable and long-term financing mechanisms, and mobilize new funds through appropriate \nadvocacy. The outcomes will be (i) a user-friendly regional data hub on HIV and AIDS providing \nstrategic information in support of well-defined strategies for targeted and cost-effective regional \nand national interventions, and (ii) sustainable funding mechanisms and partnership strategies \nidentified  to  ensure  long-term  sustainability  of  the  data  hub.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The  project  resources  will  be  used  to  consolidate  results  from  the  first  phase  by \nmaintaining the team of experts who are managing the regional data hub, collecting data, \nchecking their accuracy, and preparing data analyses. The project will continue advocating \nevidence-based planning and allocation of resources, and the benefit of sharing experiences \nwithin the region. This implies participation in conferences and workshops where the data hub \nconcept is explained and demonstrated. Based on the feedback received from the countries and \nthe recommendations of the STAG, the data hub team will develop targeted capacity building \nactivities for data collection and analyses, both online and through field visits to national AIDS \ncommittees. With approval of the steering committee, project resources will be used for regional \nand national training workshops and on-the-job supervision and training in data collection and \nanalyses, in a regional context.  \n \n10.  The composition and role of the STAG will be carefully evaluated and revised as needed. \nA broader representation of beneficiary developing member countries in the STAG will facilitate \ncollaboration, minimize political risks, and increase the credibility of the data hub. UNAIDS and \n ", "  3\nUNICEF will proactively market the use of data through their country and regional offices in \nclose  partnership  with  the  Asia\u2013Pacific  United  Nations  Regional  Directors\u2019  Team.  Their \ninvolvement is crucial to ensure coordination with the national strategic planning process and \nidentification of regional and national information gaps. \n \n11.  The memorandum of understanding between ADB and UNAIDS endorses support for \ninterventions of this nature. ADB and UNICEF are currently finalizing a similar memorandum of \nunderstanding, which recognizes the data hub as a good practice and a possible area for further \ncollaboration. The World Health Organization is also an active partner and participates in the \nSTAG meetings. ADB and its partners plan to expand the partnership base that is supporting \nthe operations of the data hub. A regional meeting will be organized to discuss the broadening \nof the partnership base, with new potential members such as the Global Fund, United Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP), and the World Bank. \n \n12.  The  project  will  deliver  the  following  outputs:  (i)  high-quality  data  available  and \naccessible to inform national and regional decision-making; (ii) easy access to data to facilitate \nstandard  reporting  and  regional  coordination;  (iii)  strengthened  capacity  for  national  and \nregional data collection and analysis; (iv) a data hub that is widely recognized as a source of \nhigh-quality data helping improve the quality of evidence-based planning and monitoring (as a \nresult of marketing and quality of data and analyses); and (v) identified alternatives to ensure \nlong-term financing of the data hub. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB from the Regional and Integration Cooperation Fund under the Regional \nCooperation  and  Integration  Financing  Partnership  Facility.7 UNAIDS  and  UNICEF  have \ncommitted to mobilize additional resources and ensure that the regional data hub will continue \nbeyond the 2011. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The  project  will  be  implemented  from  May  2010  to  April  2012.  The  existing \nimplementation  arrangements  for  the  regional  data  hub,  as  developed  under  ADB  TA  for \nFighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific will be maintained. ADB's Poverty Reduction, Gender \nand Social Development Division, Regional and Sustainable Development Department, will be \nthe executing agency. The UNICEF EAPRO, in close collaboration with the UNAIDS Regional \nSupport Team for Asia and the Pacific, will be the implementing agency. A project steering \ncommittee  including  ADB,  UNAIDS,  and  UNICEF  representatives,  will  meet  twice  a  year, \norganize the STAG meetings, and provide guidance to the data hub secretariat. \n \n15.  A secretariat consisting of a team of international and local experts has been set up in \nBangkok  with  UNICEF  assistance.  The  secretariat  is  responsible  for  the  day-to-day \nmanagement of the data hub under the supervision of UNICEF EAPRO, and ensures regular \nconsultations with all the steering committee members (ADB, UNAIDS, and UNICEF). The data \nhub secretariat reports to the steering committee.  \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2007.

Manila (established by \nADB). \n ", "4 \n16.  UNICEF, in consultation with ADB and UNAIDS, recruited the existing team of experts \n(consultants) in accordance with the Letter of Agreement, Article IV signed by ADB and UNDP \nfor the first phase. The current team, still under contract with UNICEF, includes (i) a data hub \nmanager, (ii) a research marketing and resources mobilization officer, (iii) an administrative \nassistant, and (iv) a research assistant. The terms of reference are in Appendix 2. If new \nconsultants need to be recruited, or if the existing consultants' contracts need to be renewed, \nthese  consultants  will  be  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \n \n17.  Disbursement under the project will follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement \nHandbook.8 Advance  payment  procedures  for  training,  seminars,  and  conferences  will  be \nadopted  to  allow  timely  implementation  of  activities.  If  appropriate,  an  extension  of  the \nAgreement between ADB and UNDP for the ADB TA for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the \nPacific will be considered. \n \n18.  UNICEF, in partnership with ADB and UNAIDS, will continue to ensure quality assurance \nand timely reporting as part of its management role for the data hub secretariat, and submit \nconsolidated narrative semiannual progress reports to ADB. The reporting for the first phase \nwas considered to be satisfactory and in line with ADB regulations. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nEvidence-Based Advocacy for Fighting HIV/AIDS in Asia and the Pacific: Regional HIV/AIDS \nData Hub, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2008.
