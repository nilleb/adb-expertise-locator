I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Inner Mongolia Road Development Project. The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Restoration of Wetlands in Dalai \nLake  National  Nature  Reserve  of  Inner  Mongolia  Autonomous  Region,  and  if  the  Board \napproves  the  proposed  loan,  I,  acting  under the  authority  delegated to me  by  the  Board, \napprove the TA.1 \n2.  The following activities will be undertaken under the project: (i) upgrade a section of the \nprovincial highway in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR) of the PRC, (ii) upgrade rural \nroads, (iii) facilitate cross-border transport and trade, (iv) support community-based sustainable \ntourism and environmental conservation, and (v) strengthen institutional capacity.2  \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  IMAR is the third-largest administrative region of the PRC in terms of land area and is \nwell endowed with natural resources. As a result of mining, IMAR\u2019s economy has been growing \nrapidly, with gross domestic product increasing at 18% per annum from 2003 to 2011. The \nproposed project is located in Hulunbeier, one of the fast-growing areas of IMAR.3 Hulunbeier \ncovers  253,000  square  kilometers  and  is  very  sparsely  populated  (fewer  than  4  million \ninhabitants). It borders the PRC\u2019s Heilongjiang province, the Russian Federation, and Mongolia. \nIts economy depends heavily on resource extraction industries (coal, oil, and various minerals), \nanimal husbandry, trade with the Russian Federation and to a lesser extent Mongolia, and a \ndeveloping tourism industry. Considerable infrastructure improvements are needed to support \nfurther economic growth. \n4.  The demand for transport in IMAR has grown in line with economic growth. Rail freight \nincreased from 181 million tons in 2005 to 646 million tons in 2011. Similarly, highway freight \ntraffic increased from 510 million tons in 2005 to more than 1 billion tons in 2011. Road \nconditions  in  IMAR  are  lagging  behind  the  rest  of  the  PRC.  In  2010,  the  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region Department of Transport (IMDT) estimated that only 58.5% of the region\u2019s \nroads were in good or excellent condition, against the national average of 75.8%. There is a \nbacklog of roads needing rehabilitation or upgrades. IMAR needs to prioritize upgrades to cater \nfor increased traffic and increase maintenance financing to ensure sustainability. \n5.  Provincial highway S203. The main road in Hulunbeier is provincial highway S203, \nwhich starts at Manzhouli city and is 496 kilometers (km) long. The section from Manzhouli to \nAlatanemole conforms to PRC highway class III standard4 and is in relatively poor condition. \nThere  are  numerous  sections  where  the  pavement  is  buckling  and  settling,  which  limits \noperating speeds. Traffic on the road is mainly trucks to and from regional land ports; trucks \ncarrying timber, coal, and other minerals; agricultural vehicles; tourist and local buses; and local \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance. ADB. 2009. Technical \nAssistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Inner Mongolia Road Development Project. Manila. \n3  Hulunbeier is governed as a prefecture-level city. Its administrative center is located at Hailar district, its largest \nurban area. \n4  See Technical Note on Highway Classification System in the People\u2019s Republic of China (accessible from the list of \nlinked documents in Appendix 2). ", "2 \nprivate vehicles. The development of a new industrial park south of Manzhouli is expected to \nlead to further traffic growth, including heavy trucks on the provincial highway. The existing road \nwill not be able to handle the projected volume of traffic.  \n6.  Regional integration and cross-border transport. The principal border-crossing point \nfor the region is on the Russian Federation\u2019s border at Manzhouli, which handles 60% of the \nPRC\u2019s  overland  trade  with  the  Russian  Federation.  The  two  border-crossing  points  with \nMongolia\u2014at  Arihasate  and  Ebuduge\u2014are  well  established  and  are  expected  to  grow \nsignificantly in the future. PRC-based companies are actively pursuing potential projects across \nthe border in Mongolia, which is expected to lead to increased import traffic. However, within \nIMAR, connectivity with these border crossings is inadequate. Existing roads are narrow and in \npoor condition and cannot support movement of heavy trucks. The roads to the border-crossing \npoints also need to be improved because they include links to the Asian Highway network.5 The \nChoibalsan\u2013Manzhouli\u2013Chita  corridor,  mainly  consisting  of  provincial  highway  S203,  is \npotentially a key conduit between Asian highway routes AH6 and AH32, giving shippers more \nroute choices and motivating countries to compete for transit traffic. The planned extension of \nthe Alatanemole\u2013Arihasate road to Choibalsan and beyond to Ulaanbaatar in Mongolia will \nstrengthen regional links as it will connect to Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \ncorridor 4b, which is also Asian highway route AH3. \n7.  Road safety. Road safety is a major problem in the PRC, with an estimated 210,000 \naccidents and 62,000 fatalities in 2011. In IMAR, the accident rate in 2009 was 9.4 fatalities per \n100,000 people, nearly twice the PRC average of 5.1. Accidents are also more severe in IMAR, \nwith the ratio of fatalities to injuries being four times higher than in the rest of the PRC. Road \nconditions are a major determinant of IMAR\u2019s higher accident rates, particularly on medium-\nclass roads (class III). Because of the flatness of the plains, these roads have good geometry, \nenabling  speeds  of  up  to  120  km  per  hour.  However,  they  also  tend  to  be  narrow,  lack \nshoulders, and are elevated above the plain without safety barriers. These factors make them \npotentially dangerous, especially when high speeds are involved.  \n8.  Rural roads. The region is home to a number of ethnic minorities who live in small \nvillages and towns, most of which can only be accessed via unpaved roads which become \ntreacherous during winter. The hardships of extreme cold are compounded by the occurrence of \nsnowstorms  and  blizzards.  The  low  population  density  implies  that  the  region  requires  a \nrelatively large stock of road infrastructure compared to other parts of the PRC in order to \nensure access for isolated communities. However, road density per 1,000 square kilometers is \nonly 139 km, as against the PRC average of 426 km. Providing paved roads will improve access \nto jobs, education, and health services for poor rural communities. \n9.  Environmental conservation. Hulunbeier has some of the largest and most significant \ngrassland  and  wetland  ecosystems  in  the  region.  A  major  geographical  feature  in  the \nHulunbeier landscape is Dalai Lake, one of the five largest freshwater lakes in the PRC. Dalai \nLake and associated wetland and grassland ecosystems form part of the Dalai Lake National \nNature Reserve (NNR). Since 2000 there has been a general pattern of falling water levels in \nDalai lake and shallow water wetlands and marshes have become desiccated. Increases in the \nnumbers of visitors and tourists entering the NNR are also expected to increase pressure on \nnatural resources, habitats, and species within the reserve. The Dalai Lake National Nature \n                                                \n5  The Asian Highway network aims to promote development of international road transport in the region. The \nnetwork includes 141,000 km of standardized roadways in 32 Asian countries with linkages to Europe. \n ", "3 \nReserve Management Bureau (NNR Bureau) needs to strengthen protection and conservation \nof the reserve and promote sustainable tourism activities. \n10.  Climate change. Hulunbeier is in the southernmost area of the northern hemisphere \npermafrost zone and has discontinuous and/or sporadic permafrost.6 It is expected that climate \nchange will lead to thawing of permafrost which can threaten the structural integrity of road \ninfrastructure. Infrastructure projects in the region need to factor-in climate change during the \nplanning and design phases to ensure that the projects are climate resilient. \n11.  The  project  will  address  aforementioned  regional  development,  transport,  and \nenvironmental  needs.  It  will  also  support  the  government\u2019s  Western  Region  Development \nStrategy7 and Northeast Region and Other Old Industrial Bases Revitalization Strategy.8 It is in \nline with ADB\u2019s objectives in the country partnership strategy9 and its support for road safety, \nrural  roads,  environmental  conservation,  and  cross-border transport  aligns  it  with  the  core \nobjectives of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative.10  \n12.  Lessons  from  recent  road  projects  in  the  PRC  have  included  the  need  to  provide \ncapacity  building  support  for  implementation  units,  particularly  on  procurement  and \nsafeguards,11 and for incorporating complementary support to local communities by providing \nassistance to improve community facilities.12 These lessons were reflected in the project design \nin  that  (i)  guidance  was  provided  to  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  on  ADB \nprocedures  on  safeguards  and  procurement;  (ii)  extensive  community  consultation  was \nundertaken during project preparation; and (iii) facilities for communities, such as procurement \nof rescue and relief equipment for use during extreme weather events, were included in the \nproject design.  \n13.  The project design also drew upon ADB\u2019s 2007 sector assistance program evaluation \nrecommendation  of  prioritizing  value  adding  in  PRC  road  projects.13 The  project  has  the \nfollowing value-addition components: (i) safer road designs to ensure that project roads and \nbridges conform to best practices in road safety, (ii) upgrades of roads to border-crossing points \nand trade facilitation to improve regional trade links, (iii) bus terminals and bus stops in project \narea  to  promote  public  transport,  (iv) measures  to  promote  sustainable  tourism  and \nenvironmental conservation, and (v) training in road safety audits and road maintenance.  \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The impact of the project will be the efficient, inclusive, and safe movement of people \nand goods in IMAR and across the borders of the Russian Federation and Mongolia. The \nproject outcome will be the development of a safe and efficient road transport network that \nsupports environmental conservation and sustainable tourism. \n                                                \n6  Permafrost is defined as ground (soil or rock and included ice or organic material) that remains at or below 0 \ndegrees Celsius for at least 2 consecutive years.  \n7  The strategy covers six provinces and five autonomous regions including the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \n8  Five eastern prefectures of Inner Mongolia are included: Xilin Gol, Chifeng, Tongliao, Hinggan, and Hulunbeier. \n9  ADB. 2012.

The TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nEquipment purchased under the TA will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time) and transferred to the NNR Bureau upon TA \ncompletion. The TA is described in more detail in supplementary document 18.23 \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n26.  The project includes highways of class I, II, III, and IV (PRC road standard classes). The \ndesign for the S203 highway will be based on class I highway standard, with appropriate \nadjustments, particularly safety features, to allow two-way traffic. Road safety audits will be \nconducted on the detailed designs during and after construction to ensure compliance with \nrequired road safety standards. The capacity of the executing and implementing agencies is \nconsidered adequate to implement the project\u2019s technical aspects based on the performance on \npast projects. The due diligence highlighted the need to factor-in the hydrological and ecological \nfunctions of the wetlands in the detailed bridge designs. A hydrologist and design engineer will \nassist and advise the PMO on this aspect.  \nB.  Economic and Financial \n27.  The project is economically viable. Its estimated economic internal rate of return is \n13.2% and the net present economic value is $37.9 million at a 12% discount rate. Improved \ndriving  conditions  due  to  smoother  road  surfaces  will  shorten  travel  times  by  5%\u201350% \ndepending on vehicle type and road section. Vehicle operating costs will be reduced. In the \ncase of road sections upgraded from dirt track to paved road standard, vehicle operating costs \nwill be up to 35% lower. Shorter travel time and reduced vehicle operating costs will enable local \neconomic development and facilitate development of cross-border trade. The economic internal \nrate of return is robust to increases in capital costs but sensitive to traffic growth assumptions. \nThe economic internal rate of return understates the expected economic contribution of the \nproject since it is also expected to have significant unquantified benefits, particularly for cross-\nborder trade with the eastern part of Mongolia.  \n28.  The  project  roads  will  be  constructed  and  operated  by  the  IMDT,  which  is  a \nnoncommercial government agency, and will be nonrevenue earning. The financial analysis \nconfirmed  that  the  IMDT  will  have  sufficient  revenues  to  repay  the  loan  and  finance  the \noperation and maintenance of the project roads. \nC.  Governance \n29.  All procurement to be financed under the ADB loan will be carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as \n                                                \n22 Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n23 Technical  Assistance\u2013Restoration  of  Wetlands  in  Dalai  Lake  National  Nature  Reserve  of  Inner  Mongolia \nAutonomous Region (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \namended  to  date)  will  be  included  in  all  procurement  documents  and  contracts.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed with the government, the executing and \nimplementing  agencies,  and  the  PMO.  Specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures  are  described  in  the  project  administration  manual.  An  assessment  of  financial \nmanagement capacity indicates that the executing and implementing agencies closely follow \nPRC policies and procedures for accounting and financial management. The implementing \nagency has strong accounting and financial management capacity, as well as experience in \nmanaging multiple large construction projects. \nD.  Poverty and Social \n30.  A social impact analysis was conducted in accordance with ADB guidelines. While IMAR \nhas achieved high economic growth, rural per capita incomes lag behind the rest of the PRC. In \n2011, the average per capita income in rural areas was CNY6,642, which was lower than in the \nneighboring  provinces  of  Heilongjiang,  Jilin,  and  Liaoning.24 One  of  the  three  project  qi \n(counties), Xinzuo Qi, is designated poor under the provincial poverty criteria. Using the IMAR \npoverty standard of CNY3,100 for the rural population, the rural poverty rate in 2011 was 59.5% \nfor Xinzuo Qi and 25.5% for Xinyou Qi. 25 Poor infrastructure, lack of nonfarm employment \nopportunities and skills, and frequent natural disasters such as snowstorms are among the main \ncauses of poverty. \n31.  The project will result in better road connectivity, reduce various transport-related costs \nand travel time, and improve access to economic and employment opportunities and social \nservices. It will stimulate investment in the area and promote industrial growth, cross-border \ntrade, tourism development, and nonfarm employment. Rural roads will improve the access of \nrural communities to more diverse, nonpastoral livelihoods and will also result in higher profits \nfrom  livestock  and  farm  products.  Rural  roads  will  ensure  year-round  road  connectivity, \nincluding rescue and relief operations during snowstorms, enhancing the resilience of local \npeople to such shocks that often result in their impoverishment. \n32.  Gender. Within the project area, women have particular transport needs arising from \ntheir  various gender  roles  and  patterns  of mobility,  and from  combining farm  work  and/or \nemployment with travel to markets, health clinics, and other services. To ensure that women \nbenefit equally, a gender action plan will be implemented to ensure that women (i) participate in \nproject activities and decision-making processes; (ii) benefit from employment opportunities \ncreated  by  the  project;  and  (iii)  participate  in  capacity  development  measures,  particularly \nlivelihood  improvement  measures  such  as  community-based  ecotourism  development. \nImplementation  of  the  gender  action  plan  will  be  monitored  through  collection  of  gender-\ndisaggregated data on project activities.  \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  The project is classified A for environment, B for involuntary resettlement, and A for \nindigenous peoples. \n34.  Environment. A consolidated environmental impact assessment and an environmental \nmanagement plan were prepared for the seven project roads and a linked road that is treated as \nan associated facility. These documents comply with PRC regulatory requirements and ADB\u2019s \n                                                \n24 Per capita rural income for Heilongjiang is CNY7,591, for Jilin CNY7,510, and for Liaoning CNY8,297.  \n25 This standard is higher than the PRC\u2019s national poverty line of CNY2,300 per capita.  \n ", "9 \nSafeguard Policy Statement (2009), and were disclosed on the ADB website on 14 December \n2012. The most significant environmental risk is the potential for adverse impacts on sensitive \nwetland and grassland habitats, Dalai Lake NNR, and a local cultural artifact, the Genghis Khan \nsidewall. Through the environmental management plan, 4% of the project budget is allocated for \nimplementation  of  environmental  management  measures  to  mitigate  such  impacts. \nEnvironmental complaints or disputes will be handled through a grievance redress mechanism \nestablished for the project. Impacts and risks will be minimized to an acceptable degree if the \nenvironmental management plan and the support program26  for the reserve are implemented \neffectively in compliance with loan covenants. \n35.  The Hulunbeier grasslands and the reserve are considered critical habitat under the \nSafeguard Policy Statement. In line with the requirements of the Safeguard Policy Statement for \nprojects  in  critical  habitats  and  protected  areas,  specialist  studies  were  carried  out  to \ndemonstrate  that  there  will  be  no  measurable  adverse  impacts  on  critical  habitats  and  to \ndevelop  a  support  program  for  the  reserve.  The  program  includes  three  subcomponents: \n(i) managing  and  raising  the  awareness  of  road  users,  (ii)  ecological  management  and \nmonitoring, and (iii) eco-cultural tourism demonstration. The program is intended to promote and \nenhance the conservation aims of the protected area, offset induced impacts of the project, and \nachieve a net gain for biodiversity. The project area is in a permafrost zone, so the risks of \npermafrost  degradation  and  considerations  for  road  design  and  maintenance  have  been \nassessed. Current climate change projections indicate that permafrost in the project area is \nunlikely to degrade until the end of the century. \n36.  Involuntary resettlement. Seven project roads will result in permanent land acquisition \nof 15,680 mu and will partially affect 792 people.27 Almost 93% of the land to be acquired is \ngrassland, most of which is already degraded and its acquisition will have little impact on the \nlivelihood of the affected people. The project will also result in demolition of two unused houses \n(175 square meters) affecting seven people, and part of a disused cement factory affecting 98 \npeople. The affected people will be compensated for their losses. Four resettlement plans \nprepared by the Hulunbeier Bureau of Transport in accordance with Safeguard Policy Statement \nadequately address the land acquisition and resettlement impacts and are based on substantive \nconsultation with affected people. The IMDT has assured that it will implement the involuntary \nresettlement  safeguard  measures  set  out  in  the  resettlement  plans,  including  providing \nbudgetary resources. The resettlement plans have been disclosed to the affected people and on \nthe ADB website. The IMDT has relevant experience in implementing social safeguards, and \nadditional capacity development support for social safeguards implementation is also included \nin the project.  \n37.  Indigenous peoples. Within the project-affected area, Mongolians are the main ethnic \nminority community, mainly living in rural areas. Village and household surveys indicate that the \nethnic  minority  community  supports  the  project.  Improved  rural  roads  will  be  particularly \nbeneficial for the ethnic minority community, ensuring better access to social services and \nnonfarm employment opportunities, higher profitability from livestock and farm products, and \nimproved disaster rescue and relief delivery. The community will also benefit from preferential \ntreatment for project-generated employment opportunities. Potential negative impacts include \nconstruction-related  disturbances  and  road  safety,  and  concerns  about  impacts  on  ethnic \nculture and customs. To avoid and mitigate these impacts, an ethnic minority development plan \n                                                \n26 Community-Based Tourism and Environment Conservation\u2013Detailed description of support program for the Dalai \nLake National Nature Reserve (components under Outputs 4 and 5) (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n27 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters). \n ", "10 \nbased on substantial community consultations has been prepared and budgeted. It has been \nendorsed by the Hulunbeier Bureau of Transport and disclosed to the affected communities and \non the ADB website.  \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n38.  The project has no unusual risks and the project\u2019s benefits and impacts are expected to \noutweigh costs and risks. Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and \ndescribed in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.28 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProcurement delays  PMO will hire an external procurement agency to handle all bidding.

ASSURANCES  \n39.  The government and IMDT have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the project administration manual and loan documents. \n \n40.  The government and IMDT have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan agreement and project agreement. \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n41.
