The  project  area  covers  three  oblast  (province)\ncapital cities with high incidence of poverty\u2014Djizzak, Gulistan,\nand Karshi\u2014in the central and southern parts of the country. The\nProject  will  improve  water  supply  services  to  about  484,000\npeople of whom about 45 percent are poor.\nClassification Poverty: Poverty intervention\nThematic: Human development\nEnvironmental Category B. An initial environmental examination was undertaken,\nAssessment the summary is a core appendix. The Project will not have any\nadverse impact on the environment but will have a positive impact\nby improving the quality of delivered water and the efficiency of\noperation.\nRationale Since independence in 1991, inadequate budgetary support for\nurban infrastructure in Uzbekistan has led to the deterioration of\nservice provision. Operation and maintenance of aging assets is\nbecoming  increasingly  difficult,  performance  efficiency  has\ndropped, and the cost of service delivery has risen. Since urban\nwater supply plays a vital role in determining the living standards\nand pattern of human development, this deterioration must be\nstopped. The capacity of the sector agencies concerned must\nalso  be  developed  to  enable  them  to  implement  upgrading\nprograms and to undertake operation and maintenance of the\nsystems in the long term. In line with the Government\u2019s policy to\ndecentralize authority and responsibility for urban infrastructure\nand its assets to the local authorities, the Project will improve the\nprovision  and  management  of  water  supply  to  the  cities  of\nDjizzak,  Gulistan,  and  Karshi.  All  three  cities  urgently  need\nrehabilitation and upgrading of basic water supply facilities and\nservices  that  are  barely  meeting  national  standards  and\nincreasingly lag behind growing demand. Currently only about 60\npercent of the population receive some water every day. Because\nassets frequently fail to operate, water is often rationed for a few\nhours a day. If the water systems in these cities are not upgraded,\nthey will fail to operate within the next 5 to 10 years.\nObjective and Scope The main objective of the Project is to improve the quality of life\nand health conditions in the provincial capital cities of Djizzak,\nGulistan, and Karshi, where over 45 percent of the population are\npoor. The Project will improve basic water supply through two", "iii\ncomponents:  water  supply  and  capacity  building.  The  water\nsupply component will include rehabilitating and upgrading the\nwater supply systems in the three cities. The aim is to secure 24-\nhour supply, minimize unaccounted for water losses from about\n40 percent to 30 percent, increase supply efficiency, and lower\nunit costs. The capacity building component includes a training\nprogram  for  local  governments  and  agencies  responsible  for\nwater supply; social development measures such as involvement\nof  nongovernment  and  community-based  organizations  in\ncommunity participation and consumer awareness initiatives to\nimprove distribution and penetration of benefits; and consulting\nservices for project management support.\nCost Estimates The estimated project cost is $65.5 million equivalent, comprising\nforeign exchange costs of $32.9 million (50 percent) and local\ncurrency costs equivalent to $32.6 million (50 percent).\nFinancing Plan ($ million)\nSources of Financing Foreign Local   Total Percent\nExchange Currency\nAsian Development Bank 32.9 3.1 36.0 55.0\nCentral Government 0.0 10.1 10.1 16.0\nLocal Government 0.0 19.4 19.4 29.0\nTotal 32.9 32.6 65.5 100.0\nLoan Amount and Terms It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a\nloan of $36.0 million from its ordinary capital resources. The loan\nwill have a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years,\nwith interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based\nvariable lending rate system1 for US dollar loans, and will carry a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, and a front-end\nfee of 1.0 percent of the loan amount.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2007\nExecuting Agency Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA)\nImplementation A  central  project  management  unit  will  be  established  within\nArrangements UCSA  and  be  responsible  for  planning,  organizing,  and\nimplementing  the  Project.  Project  implementation  units  will  be\nestablished in each of the three project cities for financial and\nprocurement management. The three water supply agencies in\nthe  project  cities  and  the  UCSA  General  Directorate  on\nInterregional Water Trunk Mains will be responsible for day-to-day\nimplementation activities. A project steering committee comprising\n                  \n1 The Government is reviewing details of the loan product based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), and\nduring loan negotiations decided to use the pool-based US dollar facility for the Project. The loan terms may be\nrevised, as appropriate, if and when the Borrower chooses to borrow under the LIBOR-based loan product for this\nProject.", "iv\nrepresentatives  from  central  and  local  governments  has  been\nformed to provide policy guidance, and to monitor and supervise\noverall project implementation.\nProcurement The procurement of goods and services to be financed by the\nADB loan will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\nfor Procurement. International competitive bidding procedures will\nbe applied for supply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of\n$500,000 or more, and civil works contracts valued at over $1.0\nmillion.  Supply  contracts  with  a  value  of  less  than  $500,000\nequivalent will follow international shopping or local competitive\nbidding, as applicable. Civil works contracts valued at less than\n$1.0 million will be carried out under local competitive bidding.\nConsulting Services The Project will require 405 person-months of consulting services\n(45  person-months  of  international  and  360  person-months  of\ndomestic) for design engineering, finance and accounting, social\ndevelopment, community development, and project management.\nConsultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to\nADB for the engagement of domestic consultants.\nEstimated Project 31 December 2006\nCompletion Date\nProject Benefits and The Project will directly benefit about 484,000 people in the cities\nBeneficiaries of Djizzak, Gulistan, and Karshi, where about 45 percent of the\npopulation are poor. The support for decentralized management\nand capacity building will enhance the efficiency and sustainability\nof urban water supply services at local levels. To comply with the\nneeds and demands of the community, a participatory approach\nwas  adopted  to  formulate  and  design  the  Project,  and  the\ncommunity will continue to be involved in implementation. Upon\ncompletion of the Project, all residential, commercial, industrial,\nand  institutional  consumers  will  receive  24-hour  water  supply.\nHuman development benefits include improvements to the health\nand general welfare of the population, especially the poor who are\nless able to afford other coping mechanisms such as large water\nstorage containers and bottled water. Time will be saved for more\nproductive  activities,  particularly  for  women  who  are  often\nresponsible for collecting water. By reducing water losses and\nwastage,  the  existing  inefficiencies  and  resulting  costs  will  be\nminimized. A new tariff structure will be introduced where users\nare charged by the volume of water consumed. The proposed\ntariff structure is targeted at full cost recovery while providing the\nnecessary  mechanisms  to  protect  vulnerable  sections  of  the\ncommunity against unaffordable cost increases. To this end, a\nlifeline tariff will be introduced where a low tariff is set for low\nconsumption  to  ensure  that  benefits  reach  the  poor.  The\nproposed  average  residential  tariff  charges  are  about  4  to  5\npercent of the household income in the project cities. These are in", "v\nline with ADB\u2019s affordability criteria of 5 percent of household\nincome and are within the consumers\u2019 average willingness to pay.\nSecurity of supply and improved standards of service will increase\nthe willingness to pay for service and will assist in cost recovery.\nFinancial management and accounting improvements, including\nmeter reading, billing, and collection will improve tariff collection\nlevels  and  the  viability  of  the  implementing  agencies.  The\neconomic internal rate of return for the project components in\nDjizzak is 18.2 percent; Gulistan, 17.2 percent; and Karshi, 24.4\npercent;  all  exceed  the  economic  opportunity  cost  of  capital,\nwhich is assumed to be 12 percent. The financial internal rates of\nreturn for the project component in Djizzak and Gulistan are 9.5\npercent,  and  in  Karshi,  8.4  percent,  exceeding  the  weighted\naverage  cost  of  capital,  which  is  about  5.0  percent,  and\ndemonstrating that each component is financially viable.\nTechnical Assistance An  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA),  Capacity  Building  for\nUrban  Water  Supply,  will  be  provided  in  conjunction  with  the\nProject.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $860,000  equivalent,\ncomprising  $513,500  of  foreign  exchange  cost,  and  $346,500\nequivalent  of  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance  $600,000\nequivalent, on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, to\ncover the entire foreign exchange cost and $86,500 equivalent of\nthe  local  currency  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  the\nremaining $260,000 equivalent of the local currency costs.\nThe TA will help the Government strengthen the capacity of its\nsector institutions and train concerned staff at various levels of\ngovernment in appropriate management systems for delivering\nsustainable urban water supply services. The TA will help the\nlocal  governments  and  utility  agencies  to  improve  their\norganization structures and capacities. The TA will establish a\ntraining  center  through  which  training  activities  can  be\ncoordinated,  and  prepare  training  programs  and  training  and\noperational  manuals  on  project  management,  financial\nmanagement, and community participation for staff at government\ninstitutions and utility agencies.", "vi", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Urban Water Supply Project.

INTRODUCTION\n2. The  provision  of  urban  infrastructure  services  in  Uzbekistan  has  deteriorated  since\nindependence in 1991 due to budgetary constraints. Operation and maintenance (O&M) of\naging assets is becoming increasingly difficult and the cost of service delivery has risen. The\nGovernment recognizes the need for institutional change and development. Under its reform\npolicy, the Government has decentralized authority and responsibility for the operation and\nmanagement of urban infrastructure assets to local authorities. The Asian Development Bank\n(ADB) through its country operational strategy1 seeks to assist Uzbekistan in managing the\ntransition  to  a  market  economy  and  reduce  poverty  through  institutional  development.\nAssistance in the urban sector is aimed at addressing governance and decentralization issues,\nparticularly in the provision of communal services and management.\n3. In 1999, the Government asked ADB to support the improvement of urban infrastructure\nat the local level. ADB approved a TA2 in May 2000 to assist the Government in preparing its\nfirst  urban  infrastructure  project.  The  TA  was  implemented  by  the  Uzbekistan  Communal\nServices  Agency  (Uzcommunkhizmat)  (UCSA)3  and  was  completed  in  July  2001.  The  TA\nsupported  local  capacity  building  and  designed  an  investment  proposal  for  decentralized\ndevelopment of urban infrastructure in three cities. The TA was divided into three parts. Part A\nassessed  the  current  situation  and  proposed  measures  to  strengthen  urban  infrastructure\npolicies,  including  preparation  of  an  urban  infrastructure  sector  profile.  Part  B  was  the\npreparation of a medium-term urban infrastructure investment program where priority projects\nfor the next 5 to 10 years were identified. After screening investment needs in various urban\nsubsectors, the highest needs were established for water supply, heating, and hot water. Under\npart C, the TA consultants helped the central and local governments and sector agencies\ndevelop an investment proposal covering three water supply and two heating and hot water\ncomponents in three cities, and a capacity building program. Due to insufficient counterpart\nfunds to cover all the components, the Government decided to proceed with only the water\nsupply component, in line with its priority program for the urban infrastructure sector. The\nproposed  Project  was  prepared  in  close  consultation  with  the  communities,  and  detailed\nanalyses,  including  socioeconomic  surveys,  were  carried  out.  A  participatory  approach,\ninvolving the communities and local government agencies, was used to formulate the Project.\nThis report is based on the findings of the Appraisal Mission from 26 June to 13 July 20014 and\n                  \n1 Memo to Board 120-00, STS: UZB 2000-05, Country Operational Strategy Study for Uzbekistan, April 2000.\n2\n TA 3440-UZB: Urban Social Infrastructure Development Project, for $720,000, approved on 18 May 2000.\n3\n UCSA, the former Ministry of Communal Services, was established under President Decree No. 2791 (19\nDecember 2000) and its organization and functions were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers under Resolution\nNo. 493 (21 December 2000).

BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Economy in Transition\n4. Uzbekistan lies at the heart of Central Asia and is a double landlocked country. The\nterritory comprises 448,000 square kilometers with a population of 24.58 million in 2000 of\nwhich about 9.2 million (38 percent) is urban. The country has 22 cities with Tashkent, the\ncountry\u2019s capital, being the largest with a population of 2.1 million. The six largest cities have\npopulations between 200,000 and 400,000.5\n5. Uzbekistan has adopted its own form of a gradualist reform strategy to minimize the\nsocial costs of transition. The depth and duration of the postindependence decline in incomes\nhas been less severe than in other Commonwealth of Independent States countries. Modest\neconomic  growth  resumed  in  1996.  In  1998  and  1999,  the  economy  suffered  from  three\nexogenous shocks: the Russian Federation\u2019s financial crisis; adverse weather conditions that\naffected the cotton harvests; and low international prices for gold and cotton, Uzbekistan\u2019s\nprincipal exports. In 1999 and 2000 the gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 4.4 and 4.0\npercent. However, inflation is high, exceeding 24 percent in 2000, and is expected to remain\nhigh. Interest rates continue to remain negative in real terms and the investment climate has not\nimproved. The external sector situation is a cause of concern with the external debt servicing\nburden rising, and the current account continuing to deteriorate. Economic performance in 2001\nis forecast to remain modest in 2001 with GDP growth at 4.5 percent, inflation at 22 percent,\nand  the  balance  of  payment  situation  still  under  pressure.  The  agriculture  sector  faces\nworsening prospects both on account of recent adverse weather conditions and continued\ndistortion of the incentives structure due to administrative controls and regulations. The industry\nsector may receive a boost as a result of the concessions announced for the small- and\nmedium-size enterprise sector on 22 June 2001.6 These have improved access of small- and\nmedium-size enterprises to foreign exchange and included some policy changes that will raise\ntheir profitability.\n6. The three key transition issues facing Uzbekistan today are (i) the foreign exchange\nregime, which is characterized by multiple exchange rates; (ii) the state procurement system for\nhigh-value  (high-liquidity)  commodities  like  gold  and  cotton;  and  (iii)  the  combination  of\nmonetary and fiscal policies that are resulting in annual inflation rates of about 20 percent. The\nGovernment has taken steps (footnote 6) to unify the three exchange rates by expanding the\nscope of the commercial rate, which is determined by demand and supply of foreign currency.\nFor the state procurement system, a small but significant step is permitting some changes in\nsetting the procurement target on an individual basis and allowing extra production to be sold at\n                  \n5  Cities with populations between 200,000 and 400,000 include Andijan, Bukhara, Karshi, Namangan, Nukus, and\nSamarkand. Cities with less than 200,000 population include Almalyk, Angren, Bekabad, Chirchik, Djizzak,\nFergana, Gulistan, Hojeyli, Kattadurgan, Khiva, Kokhand, Navoi, Shahrixabz, Termez, and Urgench.\n6 \nResolution No. 263, On Measures of Further Liberalization of the Currency Market, 22 June 2001.", "3\na negotiated price on a pilot basis in one region. This has been done in the context of the ADB-\nfunded Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project.7\n7. During  the  Soviet  era  considerable  long-term  investment  was  made  in  urban\ninfrastructure. Based on Soviet technical norms, this was capital intensive and expensive to\nmaintain. Moreover, given the past practice of minimal charges for delivery of public services,\nthese infrastructure assets have not only lagged behind growing needs of the expanding urban\npopulation, but also are not being adequately maintained. The financial constraints faced by the\nGovernment during the transition period have also resulted in cutbacks in public expenditure.\nThis has negatively affected the quality and scope of coverage of public services in smaller\ntowns, in particular; they also suffer from weaker financial capacities. An ADB assessment of\ninfrastructure needs in 22 cities revealed an urgent need to rehabilitate and upgrade urban\nwater supply capacity and services in many of the smaller cities. The review also indicated a\nstrong need for the water utilities in these cities to adopt modern management and accounting\npractices.\n2.  Financial Constraints\n8. During the Soviet era, government-funded public organizations were responsible for\nproviding urban infrastructure services. Financial management was not based on commercial\nprinciples. While tariffs were in place before independence, they were low and not intended to\ncover the full cost of service provision. Since 1991, in line with the Government\u2019s policy on\ntransition to a market economy, institutions responsible for providing public services have been\nundergoing  a  transition  to  become  self-financing  organizations.  Institutions  such  as  the\nvodokanals (water supply and sewerage agencies) have been working on a self-financing\nprinciple  since  the  Soviet  period.  However,  weaknesses  in  collecting  water  charges  and\nmanaging  the  financial  system  mean  that  they  continue  to  remain  dependent  on  budget\nallocations for any capacity upgrading or expansion. Recent financial performance of public\nservices utility agencies indicates that all are suffering from acute financial constraints arising\nfrom increasing expenditures due to inflationary pressure and deteriorating assets that require\nurgent maintenance. Inadequate delivery of urban infrastructure services is a direct result of\nthese financial constraints. For the water utilities in most cities, although tariffs have been\nincreased for residential, industrial, and government consumers since 1997, collection rates are\nlow and falling, partly because of the poor and decreasing standard of service. The water\nutilities are all in a difficult financial position and constrained by lack of funding to expand or\nmodernize their facilities. Thus, these agencies need to strengthen their capacity to better\nmanage their assets, operations, and finances. Governance of these organizations should also\nbe improved to ensure accountability and transparency of their operation and management. The\nutility agencies recognize their weaknesses and are committed to reform.\n3.  Poverty and Social Protection\n9. Poverty in Uzbekistan is multidimensional in character. Low-income families rely on\nstrong family support and assistance from the Government. While the incidence and extent of\npoverty has worsened since independence due to a decline in income, Government programs\nfor output stabilization, and expenditure on health, education, and social protection are having a\npositive impact. For example, low-income families that are unable to afford payments for basic\nneeds and services such as food, water, and heating may apply for social protection payments,\nwhich is a system of social benefit available for categories of disadvantaged people. The social\n                  \n7 Loan 1833-UZB: Ak Altin Agricultural Development Project, for $36 million, approved on 23 August 2001.", "4\nprotection budget is allocated from central Government funds to each mahalla8 (local self-\nmanagement civil committee) on the assumption that the poorest households (especially large\nfamilies and pensioners living alone) in the mahalla will be assisted.\n10. The average per capita monthly income in 2000 was estimated at SUM6,480.9 However,\nunderreporting means that the real income of some households is 30 to 40 percent higher.\nSince independence, inequality in income distribution has increased between income groups,\nsectors, and regions. The national Gini coefficient grew significantly from 0.26 in 1991 to 0.42 in\n1998 (footnote 1).10 The Government classifies the poor as a vulnerable and low-income group\nbased only on the prevailing minimum wage.11 Poor families are often headed by women and\nusually comprise more than six persons. While the poor work in low-paid public sector positions,\nagriculture,  or  home  production,  or  are  unemployed,  they  normally  have  access  to  formal\nschooling and some secondary education. In these circumstances a large proportion of urban\ncommunities have not been able to afford to pay the full O&M cost of existing facilities, and\ncertainly not to invest in new ones. Overall, the quality of living conditions, including access to\npotable water, has significantly declined during the economic transition for a major part of the\npopulation.\n11. The Government does not have a generally agreed or reliable measure of poverty, or an\nofficial poverty line. The household survey is the main source for monitoring living standards.\nBased on the before independence poverty line definition of 75 roubles per capita per month,\nthe incidence of poverty was estimated at 44 percent of the working population. If this measure\nis updated for the latest household survey (1996)12 to SUM740 per capita per month then the\nincidence of poverty in 1996 was 21.1 percent. More recent work by the World Bank and\nDeutsche  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr  Technische  Zusammenarbeit(cid:1) in  Tashkent,  Fergana,  and\nKarakalpakstan using the minimum wage criteria estimated urban poverty in these areas at 10,\n28, and 50 percent, respectively. In the same survey, self-ranked poverty (i.e., not having\nenough money for food and medicines) in these areas ranged between 30 to 70 percent of the\npopulation.\n12. Using the World Bank definition of poverty of $1 per day, the equivalent monthly income\nper capita in Uzbekistan ranges from SUM9,900 at the official exchange rate, to approximately\nSUM25,000 at the commercial exchange rate, and SUM27,750 at the market rate. Even at the\nofficial exchange rate, the average income in Uzbekistan is approximately two thirds of the $1\nper day level. Use of the $1 per day definition for poverty results in the majority of the population\nbeing categorized as poor. The United Nations Development Programme estimated the poverty\nline based on a basket of goods for the lowest 10 percent of income groups to be SUM1,006 per\n                  \n8 The mahalla system is a traditional cultural form of local government in Uzbekistan. These traditional mahallas\nhave replaced the former committee networks of the Soviet system and provide a highly decentralized and flexible\nsystem of benefit targeting. They are based on a group of elders who try to resolve conflicts and social problems\nwithin the community. The mahallas are responsible for administering social assistance on behalf of the state.\nThere are about 12,000 local level mahallas with an average of 700 households per mahalla (range from 150 to\n1,500 households).\n9 \nGovernment of Uzbekistan. 2000.

Water Supply and Sanitation\n13. The problems of urban water supply exist at the macro and micro levels throughout the\ncountry. They may be summarized as (i) geographically restricted raw water resources; (ii)\npollution of potential resources; (iii) nonoptimal management and operation of raw water supply\nsystems; (iv) absence of suitable pressure controls and restricted available pressure; (v) limited\nmetering; (vi) difficulties in maintaining existing pumping equipment and a lack of investment in\nreplacement pumps; (vii) insufficient capacity in reservoirs to respond to diurnal variations in\ndemand; (viii) old and deteriorated water distribution networks; (ix) high degree of system\nlosses, i.e., unaccounted for water; (x) absence of effective demand management; (xi) public\nattitude to water as an inexhaustible and very cheap resource resulting in wastage and low tariff\ncollection rates; (xii) poor condition of irrigation systems leading to the alternative use of potable\nwater  for  garden  and  land  watering;  and  (xiii)  poor  quality  of  technical  equipment  in  the\nvodokanals. Many of these problems relate to lack of funding. As water is a basic need, the\nGovernment is giving improvement to the water supply a high priority in its program.\n14. The oblast (province) and city vodokanals are responsible for the provision of potable\nwater in Uzbekistan. Water resources are drawn from the Syrdarya and Amudarya rivers and\nfrom aquifers. Only 10 percent and 8 percent, respectively, of the watersheds of these rivers are\nwithin the borders of Uzbekistan, and hence the country has little control of water quantity and\nquality. The geographical distribution of underground water is uneven; most aquifers are in the\neastern part of the country. Westward, both rivers and aquifers are polluted by organic matter\nand industrial wastes, and contain high mineral content. The sources for potable water supplies\nto the cities vary from borehole to river and canal abstraction or a combination of both. Because\nof the problems of high mineral and organic content of water and the restricted availability of\nresources in some regions, water supply has often been undertaken on a regional basis, with\ntransmission over long distances.\n15. Over 90 percent of the urban areas are connected to piped water supply. However,\nwater resource capacity is limited due to insufficient borehole yield to permit a continuous\nsupply. Reservoir storage is also restricted and actual demand reduces reserves to very short\nperiods contributing to the need to schedule supplies in some areas. Water supply in all major\ncities is by means of interconnected reticulation networks, which are pressurized by second-\nstage pumping. Pumping is reduced at night when demand falls but otherwise the entire supply\nnetwork is designed to accommodate peak flows. The distribution systems tend to be old, in\nvarying stages of disrepair, and prone to high levels of leakage. The pumping equipment is\nfrequently considerably more than 25 years old, and is of Russian origin, making spare parts\ndifficult to obtain. Cannibalization of some equipment keeps others operational. The aging\nassets have resulted in poor delivery of services. Water rationing is common in all cities. Most\nindustry is metered and the remaining water supplied is then attributed to consumer demand\n                  \n13\nUNDP. 1996. Method of Calculating Poverty in Uzbekistan. Tashkent.\n14\nTA to prepare a medium-term strategy for improving the living standards for the people of Uzbekistan is currently\nbeing processed. One of its outputs will be to determine the appropriate poverty threshold to be used as the\nbaseline for identifying target groups for poverty interventions. The TA is expected to be completed by the end of\n2001.", "6\n(including losses and wastage) resulting in a range of 250 liters per capita per day (lcd) to nearly\n1,000 lcd (about six times the average in European cities). This use is in addition to the supply\nof between 200 to 400 lcd of hot water. At present only 1.8 percent of domestic consumption is\nmetered.15\n16. Wastewater treatment facilities are provided in all major cities. The systems connect with\nalmost all apartment buildings and some private housing. The extent of the sewerage system\nvaries according to city and ranges from 30 to 90 percent. The TA assessed that the sewerage\nsystem appears to be operating with fewer problems than the water supply system, despite its\naging facilities. The Government has plans to improve the coverage of the sewerage system to\nat least 70 percent by 2010. However, due to financial constraints at the local government level,\npriority is given to water supply and upgrading of the water supply systems. Once Government\nlegislation  on  pollution  charging  is  fully  operational  and  tariffs  are  properly  recovered,\nopportunities for self-funding of necessary improvements will be available.\n5.  Government Institutions\n17. Government institutions involved in the investment, management, and delivery of urban\ncommunal services such as water supply, sanitation, and heating are UCSA, oblast and city\ngovernments, the territorial communal exploitation agencies (TCEAs), and the oblast and city\nvodokanals. The institutional structure for communal services is shown in Appendix 2. UCSA\nwas established as a result of the reorganization of the former Ministry of Communal Services\n(footnote 3) in support of Government policy to decentralize communal services to local levels.\nThe department responsible for water was reorganized into a general directorate responsible for\noperation and development of interregional water trunk mains, and all other responsibilities for\nthe delivery of drinking water were devolved to the oblast and city levels. The technical design\ninstitutes  for  communal  services  and  the  center  for  developing  norms  and  guidelines  and\ntechnical training report to UCSA. UCSA, which reports to the Cabinet of Ministers, is now a\nself-financing institution funded by income from the enterprises and organizations that comprise\nit.\n18. The TCEA for each oblast has overall responsibility for providing housing and communal\nservices in their area, including drinking water, central heating, and sewerage. According to\nResolution No. 493 (footnote 3), the TCEA reports to the oblast government. However, the\nTCEA still has working relations with UCSA, which coordinates work to reform the communal\nservices system, develops and approves the normative-legal acts, and implements controls for\nthe observance of current legislation and established technical requirements. The oblast TCEA\nis responsible for the main capital development and infrastructure programs in the oblast and is\nin charge of the oblast vodokanals. The oblast vodokanal manages the city vodokanal, which is\nresponsible for providing drinking water within the city. The city vodokanal also works closely\nwith the city government, which is the owner of the communal assets, and is fully responsible for\nsystem O&M in the city.\n6.  Community-Based and Nongovernment Organizations\n19. Part of the Government\u2019s decentralization and reform policy is to increase community\nparticipation in the development of communal services. To this end, the Government issued\nResolution  No.  363  on  self-governing  of  the  community.  NGOs  and  community-based\norganizations  (CBOs)  have  been  developed  with  varying  degrees  of  success.  Mahalla\n                  \n15Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency, April 2001.", "7\ncommittees are CBOs that administer local funds to provide welfare to vulnerable households\n(footnote 8), execute local projects, and perform ceremonies at the local community level.\nExamples of prominent local NGOs are Kamalot and Red Crescent. The former is a self-\ngovernment  organization  founded  to  raise  funds  for  youth  development,  including  small\nbusiness development. The latter is affiliated with an international NGO in the health sector.\nMahalla committees and NGOs must be involved in the Project to facilitate public participation in\nproject implementation, monitoring, and sustainability. As most of the local NGOs were only\nestablished  recently,  their  coverage  is  not  wide  and  they  are  facing  various  operational\nproblems. Lack of funding and training capacity are major constraints for many of the NGOs.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n20. The  Government\u2019s  urban  sector  policy  supports  its  overall  five-year  development\nstrategy in which the priorities include further democratization of society and liberalization of the\neconomy. Within this context, commitment to institutional and financial reforms in the urban\ninfrastructure sector is significant in current Government policy, decrees, and resolutions. This is\nparticularly evident with Resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers No. 461 (3 November 1998), The\nConcept of Deepening Economic Reforms in the Communal Services System of the Republic of\nUzbekistan. This emphasizes decentralizing the delivery of services and increasing the level of\nprivatization and private sector participation in the sector.\n21. Reorganization of the communal services system reinforces the reforms (para. 17).\nHowever, the progress of these policies is constrained by the financial limitations on new\ninvestment. Urban infrastructure investment projects by ADB and others are needed to support,\nfinance, and focus these financial and institutional reforms through their implementation policies.\nIn particular, urban infrastructure investment should promote decentralized implementation and\nsupport private sector participation and other market reforms.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n22. External assistance to the urban water supply sector is limited. This includes an ongoing\nWorld Bank water supply and health project in the cities of Nukus and Urgench in the western\nand poorest part of the country, and a project under preparation by the World Bank for water\nsupply in the cities of Bukhara and Samarkand. Bilateral assistance includes a number of\nprojects under preparation. The French government is proposing assistance to water supply and\nsanitation  in  the  cities  of  Namangan  and  Samarkand,  and  the  Spanish  government  is\nconsidering  assistance  for  water  supply  in  Bukhara.  Appendix  3  lists  external  assistance\ninitiatives by multilateral and bilateral funding agencies to the urban water supply sector. The\nproposed Project will be ADB\u2019s first urban project in the country. In preparing the Project, close\ncontact was maintained with major urban sector assistance agencies. This has led to joint\napproaches on strategies to assist the Government in decentralizing communal services and\nimproving the governance and financial performance of sector institutes. These include tariff\nreforms, project implementation at the local levels, and introduction of international accounting\nand  financial  management  systems.  Furthermore,  the  Project  includes  a  comprehensive\ncommunity participation and capacity building program, which is complementary to the reform of\nthe  communal  services  sector  through  stronger  stakeholder  involvement.  The  Project  was\nprocessed in close coordination with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development,", "8\nwhich is currently processing in parallel a heating and hot water project16 in two of the three\nproject cities.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n23. As this will be ADB\u2019s first funding of an urban project in Uzbekistan, experience from\nimplementing urban projects financed by other external funding agencies and ADB\u2019s portfolio in\nother sectors were considered when designing the Project. Several lessons have been learned.\nOn the preparation of projects, overall processing has been protracted because of difficulties\nencountered during policy dialogue and policy uncertainty. The project development process is\noften  delayed  due  to  a  prolonged  process  for  releasing  information.  More  stakeholder\nconsultation and participation is required when preparing projects in accordance with the needs\nof the Government and beneficiaries to ensure ownership and commitment. The Government\nrecognizes  the  need  to  focus  on  sustainability  of  operations  and  increasing  ownership  by\nbeneficiaries.\n24. The lessons from ADB urban projects in other countries, in particular those in Central\nAsia have also been studied. In general, the implementation agencies\u2019 limited experience with\nproject implementation has led to delays and slow disbursement. Another problem is the weak\ninstitutional  capacity  of  the  local  governments  where  substantial  technical  and  financial\nassistance  is  required.  These  issues  were  discussed  with  the  Government  during  project\nformulation  and  appropriate  measures  including  project  management  support  and  training\nprograms on implementation procedures have been comprehensively incorporated in the project\ndesign.\n25. The  Government  and  ADB  are  now  focusing  on  community  consultation  and\nparticipation,  and  on  decentralizing  the  implementation  process.  While  the  capacity  and\npotential for NGO involvement in project development is recognized, their appropriateness\nneeds  to  be  measured  against  carefully  defined  criteria  to  ensure  successful  project\nimplementation.  Best  practices  indicate  that  NGOs  and  CBOs  have  certain  strengths  and\nweaknesses. Project design has taken these into consideration. City-based NGOs are important\nand can contribute much where they have established networks. NGO and CBO training will be\nsupported by the Project through a comprehensive capacity building program for local sector\nagencies.\nE.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy\n26. The central goal of ADB\u2019s strategy in Uzbekistan is to help manage the transition to a\nmarket-based economy, and support sustainable poverty reduction and improved standards of\nliving. In support of this goal, ADB\u2019s operational strategies are defined as (i) assisting the\nGovernment in managing the transition to an economy that relies on market-based institutions;\n(ii) supporting basic reforms including strengthening the institutional capacity for governance\nand specifically the development of financial institutions; (iii) minimizing the social costs of the\ntransition and increasing human development through TA and investment activities in education,\nearly childhood development, and urban development; and (iv) fully unlocking the potential for\nfuture economic growth by encouraging regional cooperation in trade, supporting agriculture\n                  \n16 The heating and hot water component was originally included in the design of the proposed Project. At the request\nof the Government, this component was deleted due to inadequate counterpart funding. Subsequently, the\nEuropean Bank for Reconstruction and Development expressed interest and is processing it as a separate project\nin parallel to the proposed Project. The two projects will mutually improve urban infrastructure services in the\nproject cities to maximize benefits to the population.", "9\nand  rural  development,  and  providing  direct  support  to  the  private  sector,  especially  in\ncomplementing public sector projects.\n27. ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  the  urban  sector  will  be  particularly  orientated  to  addressing\ngovernance  and  decentralization  issues,  especially  in  providing  communal  services  and\nmanagement.  Urban  governance  encompasses  institutional  strengthening  and  capacity\nbuilding,  community  participation,  and  involvement  of  the  private  sector.  Ongoing  policy\nchanges  in  the  delivery  of  municipal  services  should  improve  the  transparency  and\naccountability of local governments and participation of the target beneficiaries in governance-\nrelated decision making. The Project will support these issues.\n28. ADB\u2019s  poverty  reduction  strategy  supports  the  development  of  accountable  local\ngovernments and improved urban management to address the problem of inadequate and\ninefficient municipal services that affect the urban poor. ADB is helping the Government prepare\na national strategy for improving living standards of the vulnerable and poorer income groups.\nThe  Government  has  indicated  that  improved  water  supply  and  other  urban  infrastructure\nservices in poor areas will be an integral part of this strategy. In line with its emphasis on\npoverty  reduction,  ADB  TA  to  prepare  a  national  strategy  to  improve  the  living  standards\n(footnote 14) is currently being processed for completion in 2001. This will likely culminate in a\npoverty partnership agreement in the first half of 2002. The Project, which will have a significant\nimpact on the urban poor, supports the priorities of both the Government and ADB.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n1.  Institutional Reform and Decentralization of Implementation\n29. Infrastructure investments have traditionally been planned and financed by the central\nGovernment. While current Government policies, decrees, and resolutions reflect significant\ncommitment  to  implementing  institutional  and  financial  reforms  in  the  urban  infrastructure\nsector, top-down approaches are still embedded at all administrative levels of government. In\nparticular, participation of local communities is rare. However, with Presidential Decree 2791\nand Resolution 493 (footnote 3), delivery and maintenance of urban infrastructure services has\nbeen devolved to the oblasts and cities. The Project addresses decentralization and governance\nissues,  particularly  to  strengthen  the  institutional  and  financial  capacity  of  oblast  and  city\ngovernments to carry out the decentralized functions of providing and maintaining local water\nsupply services. As a result of ADB policy dialogue with the central and local governments, the\nProject will be implemented by the city governments and managed by the central Government in\nsupport of the Government\u2019s decentralization policy. The Project and the associated TA will\nprovide capacity building, particularly at the local level. The Government recognizes that for the\nsystem to be sustainable, ownership and responsibility must be passed to the users. The\nProject is structured to increase local responsibility for water supply services by decentralizing\nimplementation  and  O&M,  and  actively  involving  both  government  and  community-based\nstakeholders.\n2.  Raising  the  Standards  of  Urban  Water  Supply  Service  Delivery  and\nMaintenance\n30. Infrastructure facilities built during the Soviet period were capital and energy intensive,\nand inefficient and expensive to operate and maintain. While the normative standards set for all\nurban  water  utility  services  were  high,  capacity  is  increasingly  lagging  behind  expanding\ndemand and there are no incentives to conserve water. Urgent improvements are required to", "10\nthe water distribution systems across the country, including strengthening of pipe networks,\nsupply  zoning  with  flow  and  pressure  controls,  active  leakage  reduction  practices,  and\nrehabilitation  and  reequipping  of  pumping  stations.  This  will  contribute  to  meeting  service\nstandards  and  improving  the  delivery  of  water  in  urban  centers  to  meet  basic  human\ndevelopment needs. In parallel with these interventions, awareness for conservation of water as\na valuable resource will be increased. This will be achieved through education and public\nawareness  campaigns  in  conjunction  with  improved  customer  services.  Tariff  reforms  and\nintroduction  of  metering  of  both  bulk  water  supply  and  local  consumption  will  help  raise\nawareness and provide incentives for water conservation. The Government views water supply\nsector reform as a high priority. Through policy dialogue, the Government supports rehabilitation\nof the existing water supply facilities in the three oblast capital cities with the most urgent needs\nfor urban infrastructure repair and rehabilitation. Delivery of water services when compared with\ngovernment standards and of all those surveyed is the poorest in these three cities. Part of the\npopulation do not receive water every day and where water is available daily, the supply is\nrationed. Water needs to be stored when it is available, and bottled water is used for those who\ncan afford it. The emphasis will be on rehabilitating and upgrading existing facilities by using\ncost-efficient  technology  and  approaches.  Community  participation  in  capital  repairs  and\nmaintenance of major common elements in apartment buildings are also important to ensure\nthat improved water services are available to individual households. Fostering partnerships\nbetween  the  community,  the  utility  agencies,  and  local  governments  will  result  in  more\nresponsive infrastructure service delivery and maintenance. The Project is therefore structured\nto build ownership and responsibility at the local level and is aimed at improving customer\nservice to consumers.\n3.  Financial Performance of the Utility Agencies\n31. The  Government  is  in  the  process  of  reforming  utility  agencies  from  budget-run\norganizations to self-financing agencies, with the ability to raise and manage their own finance.\nVodokanals are self-financing organizations and do not receive operational subsidies from the\nGovernment.  Expenditure requirements are increasing due to inflation and an increasing need\nfor O&M expenditure on aging assets. Capital investment is urgently needed to enable systems\nto  function  correctly.  Vodokanal  income  is  hampered  by  poor  tariff  collection,  and  despite\nincreases in tariffs, all vodokanals are suffering from severe financial constraints because actual\nincome  does  not  cover  inflation  and  increasing  O&M  expenditures.  As  assets  deteriorate,\nservice standards decline, customers become less willing to pay, and the ability to collect tariffs\nworsens. As a result, maintenance and asset replacement is inadequate. This compounds the\ndownward  spiral  and  negates  financial  self-sustainability.  Furthermore,  utility  agencies  are\nunable to properly manage their finances using internationally accepted accounting standards.\n32. Through policy dialogue, the Government agreed to improve service delivery by these\nagencies;  restructure  tariffs  to  introduce  charging  by  volume  for  residential,  as  well  as\ncommercial and industrial customers; help those on lower incomes; improve education and\nawareness;  provide  a  transparent  billing  and  collection  system;  and  improve  the  financial\nmanagement system. All these factors will improve collection of tariffs. In addition, tariffs will be\nincreased. In line with Government policies to decentralize and reform the provision and delivery\nof basic urban services, the Project will assist in improving governance including operation and\nfinancial management of water utility agencies to ensure that their transformation is sustainable.", "11\n4.  Cost Recovery\n33. Under the reform policy, the Government seeks to establish self-financing principles for\nthe provision of urban infrastructure services.  This policy will be implemented over a number of\nyears.  Water supply services in the project cities are currently targeted to be independent self-\nfinancing entities with tariffs set to fully recover costs from user charges. The Government\nconsiders that the pricing of basic infrastructure services should fulfil four main objectives: (i)\ncost recovery to ensure financial viability and sustainability; (ii) affordability, particularly for low-\nincome residential customers; (iii) demand management through metered charging; and (iv)\neconomic efficiency. In light of these objectives and after careful analysis, the Government\nagrees that (i) full cost recovery should be targeted for all project components; (ii) in the long\nterm, cross-subsidies should be minimized, but if affordability criteria cannot be met, then cross-\nsubsidization should be pursued; (iii) the use of stepped tariffs for water, with lower rates for low\nvolume use, is a useful approach in assisting those on lower incomes; (iv) where affordability is\nlow, differential pricing can assist in cost recovery and improve collection rates; and (v) tariffs\nshould be reviewed annually to take into account collection rates, expenditure, and future\ninvestment plans; tariffs should be adjusted accordingly.\n5.  Stakeholder Participation\n34. Experience  indicates  that  beneficiary  participation,  good  governance,  and  project\nsustainability are interrelated factors that contribute to project success, and need to be factored\ninto project design and implementation arrangements. In this regard, the prevailing situation in\nthe water supply sector in Uzbekistan warrants particular attention to attune service delivery\nwith consumer demand, such that not only is the service updated technologically, but it also\naddresses site-specific needs and constraints. Consumer participation in training and decision-\nmaking activities is thus featured in the Project. Through the participatory process, consumers\nwill be educated on the need to conserve and price water as an economic resource. This\napproach is fully supported by the Government and is evidenced by its agreement to support\nformation  of  consumer  committees  to  participate  in  setting  standards  for  service  delivery,\nmonitoring, and tariff setting.\n6.  Poverty Focus\n35. While  poverty  reduction  is  not  an  explicit  government  policy,  the  Government  has\nemployed descriptive statistics and multivariate analysis to profile the characteristics associated\nwith low-income families and to link this with an evaluation of current policies on allocating\nsocial protection benefits. Inflation has meant that the total social protection expenditure and\nalso its percentage share of GDP is decreasing. In 1998 the social protection budget amounted\nto 3.5 percent of GDP and was reduced to 2.3 percent of the GDP in 2000.17 The Government\u2019s\nresponse is to adopt a gradual approach to reform to protect the needy and vulnerable from the\nworst traumas of a society in transition. The Project concept represents a pioneering effort to\ncontinue support for basic infrastructure services, and to use a screening process to direct\nassistance to the underserved and poorer urban areas. A three-stage screening methodology\nwas adopted. In stage one representative cities to be reviewed and assessed were identified.\nStage two involved the collection and review of infrastructure performance data, ranking of\ndeficiencies and needs, and the application of social need criteria, such as provision of basic\nwater supply to the poor, to generate a long list of priority projects. Stage three assessed the\n                  \n17 Ministry of Macroeconomics and Statistics. Government of Uzbekistan. 2001. The Performance of the Expenditure\nSide of the State Budget. Tashkent.", "12\nranked projects against four criteria: compliance with government policies and strategies, social\ndevelopment  benefits,  economic  benefits,  and  environmental  protection.  The  cities  that\ndisplayed the greatest need were Djizzak, Gulistan, and Karshi. All three cities represent the\npredicament of urban centers: due to budgetary constraints, they are unable to meet a growing\ndemand for provision and repair of basic utilities.\n36. The social analysis prepared in the course of designing the Project confirms that the\nthree cities contain a significant representation of the urban poor. Of the total population of\n484,000, 45 percent are poor. Other salient socioeconomic features of the population confirm\nthe significance of the Project in meeting the basic need of the urban population and the poor\namong them. Most households are in the lower to poor income category. The households\ncomprise extended families living in single-story houses called hovles; smaller nuclear families\nhoused in old apartments; and people living in houses with shop fronts, which they operate or\nrent to tenants operating small food or retail goods stalls. For this last category, uninterrupted\nwater supply is essential for their business. Poorer households living in apartments are most\nlikely to have leaking pipes inside their units and consequent water disruption. Most families try\nto cope with water disruptions by fetching and storing water from alternative sources if these are\nwithin walking distance, others have to purchase bottled water. Such alternatives are not only a\ndrain on household budgets but often unsanitary. To meet their household consumption needs,\nwomen bear the brunt of such inadequacies. Such findings have also been used to include\npoverty friendly features in the project design (paras. 38, 69, and 78).\n7.  Capacity Building\n37. Sustainable  delivery  of  urban  infrastructure  services  that  meets  the  need  of  the\npopulation depends critically on the management capacity of local utilities responsible for these\nservices. This is particularly so if management and service delivery are to be decentralized.\nVodokanals in the project cities will be encouraged to adopt market-based principles for service\ndelivery, design and costing standards, financial management, tariff setting, and collection of\ncharges. The Government and the service organizations concerned recognize that to achieve\nthis transition significant capacity building is needed in the areas of training and the acquisition\nof broader international experience particularly in finance and management. The policy dialogue\nin the context of the Project has focused on these issues. The Government supports the need\nfor  capacity  building  measures,  including  training  and  support  for  the  NGO  and  CBO\nimplementation role at the community level. This is needed for sustainable delivery of urban\ninfrastructure services. The Project is structured to build ownership and responsibility at the\nlocal and community levels with effective partnerships between the communities, the local\ngovernment, and water utility agencies.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n38. Since independence in 1991, budgetary support for urban infrastructure has slowed and\nwater supply infrastructure assets deteriorated. As a result, the urban population, including the\npoor, receives inferior and intermittent water utility services. Since urban water supply plays a\nvital  role  in  determining  the  living  standards  and  pattern  of  human  development,  the\ndeterioration of the water supply system must be stopped and strategies introduced to ensure\nthat acceptable standards are attained at costs that will not adversely affect the population,\nparticularly the poor. As part of the reform process, the Government is decentralizing authority\nand  responsibility  for  urban  infrastructure  and  devolving  its  assets  to  local  authorities.", "13\nSimultaneously, the Government recognizes the need to set tariffs for utilities and services at a\nlevel that will ensure the services can be sustained. However, increased charges and tariffs,\nwhile necessary for sustainability, might not be affordable to the financially disadvantaged, and\nproject interventions must strike a balance between resource pricing and poverty reduction\nconsiderations.  To  this  end,  mechanisms  necessary  to  protect  vulnerable  sections  of  the\ncommunity against unaffordable cost increases are included in the project design.\n39. Based on an assessment of performance data of each urban infrastructure subsector in\n22 cities throughout the country, potable water supply in Djizzak, Gulistan, and Karshi were\nidentified as having the most urgent need for rehabilitation and upgrading. Water supply in the\nthree  cities  is  characterized  by  limited  availability  of  raw  water  resources  and  lack  of\nconservation awareness and responsibility. Unaccounted for water is around 40 percent in the\nthree cities. Underfunding of assets for a significant period has led to antiquated equipment,\ninefficiency, and equipment failures. Currently only about 60 percent of the population in the\nthree project cities receive some water every day. If the water systems are not upgraded,\nDjizzak and Karshi will likely fail to supply the basic water requirement by 2007 and the system\nwill fail totally by 2015. The Gulistan system is in worse condition and will fail totally within five\nyears if the system is not upgraded or rehabilitated. Sewerage was not included in the Project\nas the existing wastewater treatment facilities in the three project cities have sufficient capacity\nto treat the additional water consumption, which is not expected to increase substantially, as a\nresult of improving the water system (para. 16).\n40. Management problems include inability of the water utility agencies to manage the\nassets in a modern and effective manner; this is further hindered by limited financial resources,\nrestricted technological expertise, and absence of economic incentives. The Project seeks to\naddress each of these problems by creating a modern and efficient operation from which the\nwhole population can expect an acceptable standard of service at an affordable cost. The\nProject will support the Government\u2019s policy to decentralize urban infrastructure services to local\ngovernments  and  to  transform  the  utility  agencies  into  financially  independent  entities.  To\nensure long-term sustainability of the sector, the Project has adopted a holistic approach to\nimprove  the  institutional,  technical,  and  financial  capacity  of  the  concerned  agencies.  The\nProject seeks to make major improvements in asset performance, and to establish capacity for\nserving  the  population  over  the  planning  period  to  2020.  The  Project  will  strengthen  and\nupgrade the quality and availability of water supply to the population in the three project cities\nand will improve the quality of life of both the poor and nonpoor. The Project is in line with\nGovernment\u2019s  decentralization  of  communal  services  and  institutional  reform  policies,  and\nADB\u2019s human development and poverty reduction objectives.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n41. The main objective of the Project is to improve the quality of life and health conditions in\nthe  oblast  capital  cities  of  Djizzak,  Gulistan,  and  Karshi,  where  about  45  percent  of  the\npopulation are poor,18 by improving basic water supply services. The Project will (i) assist the\ncentral and local governments and the utility agencies with upgrading the physical delivery\nsystems for potable water supply; (ii) improve the institutional, technical, and financial capability\nof local governments and vodokanals for planning, implementation, and O&M of the facilities;\nand (iii) promote greater community participation in managing urban water supply services.\n                  \n18The proportion of poor households in Djizzak is 37 percent; Gulistan, 44 percent; and Karshi, 51 percent.", "14\n42. The Project will also upgrade service levels and delivery efficiency, and achieve better\ncost recovery by providing capacity building and project management support. The aim is to\nassist the Government in implementing institutional reform for urban water supply services by\nimproving governance of the concerned agencies, and providing and upgrading reliable and\nfinancially sustainable urban water supply services that will promote economic development and\nreduce urban poverty. The objectives and the overall scope of the Project are in accordance\nwith the objectives of the ADB water sector policy,19 which are to improve and expand the\ndelivery of services, foster the conservation of water, increase system efficiencies, and improve\ngovernance through decentralization and capacity building of all stakeholders. The Project\nconsists of two components: water supply and capacity building.\n1.  Water Supply\n43. This component will comprise investments in the cities of Djizzak, Gulistan, and Karshi\nto upgrade and rehabilitate the water supply system and distribution network. The component\nwill (i) strengthen resource capacity and security of available water supplies by rehabilitating\n135 existing boreholes and constructing 1 new borehole (in Djizzak), (ii) improve transmission\nsecurity by expanding reservoir storage capacity by 23,000 cubic meters (m3), (iii) renew a total\nof about 142 kilometers of fragile supply and distribution pipelines, (iv) introduce new water\ndistribution mains (167 kilometers) to improve efficiency and security of supply and increase the\ncoverage of distribution networks, (v) renew pumping equipment and controls (20 second-stage\npumps in water distribution centers and 44 pumps in local booster pumping stations), (vi)\nprovide metering of bulk supplies at source and at strategic sources of supply, (vii) install\nconsumer metering to private housing (about 56,000 water meters) and to apartment blocks\n(about 1,200 water meters)20 with associated basement plumbing, and (viii) reduce leakage by\nrepairing pipework and initiating an active leakage control program. By these means resources\nand availability will be secured, demand for supply will be managed, losses will be minimized,\nsupply efficiency raised, and unit costs lowered. The standard of service will be improved and\nthe whole operation will become more financially sustainable. Capital investments will be for civil\nworks,  equipment,  and  materials.  Appendix  4  provides  a  summary  of  the  water  supply\ncomponent.\n2.  Capacity Building\n44. This  component  includes  a  training  program,  social  development  measures,  and\nconsulting services for project management support. The training program involves support for\nthe recent transition of the previous Ministry of Communal Services into UCSA, and training of\nstaff  at  the  local  governments,  mahallas,  and  vodokanals  to  strengthen  their  capacity  to\nefficiently implement, operate, and maintain the systems. Training and other capacity building\nwill also include specific initiatives to (i) introduce a new computerized accounting system for\nfinancial management of the total operation; (ii) provide training on operational management,\nparticularly aimed at asset management and improving customer services; (iii) initiate a public\nawareness campaign to encourage willingness-to-pay; and (iv) build capacity for developing\nsmall  plumbing  businesses.  The  focus  is  to  improve  the  skills  of  project  implementation\n                  \n19ADB. 2000. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila.\n20\nInstallation of water meters for individual units in apartment buildings was considered during project design.\nHowever, this would require reconstruction of the entire piping system in all apartment buildings. The cost will be\ntoo high for the Project to be financially viable. Water meters will be installed at the basement of apartment\nbuildings to start charging by volume and to initiate the practice of water conservation. Currently, poor households\nin apartment buildings are subsidized on their utility bills and the subsidy arrangement is undertaken by the local\nmahalla committees.", "15\npersonnel to carry out the Project effectively. An advisory TA, formulated in conjunction with the\nProject, will help strengthen sector institutions and establish a training center for long-term\ntraining of staff involved in the sector as well as concerned NGOs and CBOs.\n45. Social development measures to improve the distribution of benefits will be provided in\nthe form of education and awareness initiatives to support the overall goals and objectives of\nthe infrastructure provision. These will include (i) a public health awareness campaign run by\nwomen to enable the full benefits of improved drinking water supply to be realized; (ii) a\ncommunity participation and consumer rights awareness program to improve the capacity of\nconsumers to participate in project implementation, monitoring, and management; and (iii) a\nwater conservation awareness program. These will be implemented with the support of NGOs\nand CBOs, and will include the establishment of consumer committees and their participation in\nproject implementation.\n46. Project management consulting services will help implement the Project by providing\nsupport to the project management unit (PMU) and project implementing units (PIUs). The\nconsulting  services  will  also  involve  socioeconomic  surveys,  community  consultations,  and\nparticipation in project implementation with the support of NGOs and CBOs. The services will\ncover project management and monitoring, implementation of the training program, support to\nsocial development measures, supervision of implementation, and construction of the physical\ncomponents of the Project.\nC.  Technical Justification\n47. Each of the three project cities has a centralized water supply system that is suffering\nfrom production deficiencies and a fragile distribution network, both unable to sustain necessary\ndelivery pressures and lagging behind expansion of the city and growth of its population. The\nresults are insufficient capacity, inefficient operation, and poor water quality. The Project will use\nappropriate technology to improve borehole resources and system storage; develop reticulated\nsystems and strengthen distribution networks; renew pumping equipment and supply mains to\nincrease delivery pressure; provide disinfection facilities to protect against waterborne diseases;\nand reduce leakage from the distribution network by zoning, metering, and repair. Unaccounted\nfor water will be targeted for reduction from the present level (city vodokanals report it to be in\nexcess of 40 percent), to approximately 30 percent by project completion. An improved system\nand more secure water supply to areas both currently served and without an existing piped\nsupply  will  ensure  improvements  to  the  health  and  general  welfare  of  the  population.  By\nreducing water supply losses and extravagant use, as water is charged per capita and not by\nvolume consumed, the existing inefficiencies and resulting costs can be minimized. Security of\nsupply and improved standard of service will increase the willingness to pay for service and\nimprove cost recovery. Total demand for water may increase in the future due to (i) expanded\ncoverage of the supply network from currently over 90 percent to 100 percent of the population\nby  2007,  (ii)  delivery  of  24-hour  water  supply,  (iii)  natural  population  growth,  and  (iv)\nimprovements in the standard of living. Total demand for the three cities is projected to increase\nfrom the current 46,000 m3/day to 80,000 m3/day in 2020 for Djizzak, 45,000 m3/day to 60,000\nm3/day for Gulistan, and 110,000 m3/day to 130,000 m3/day in Karshi. However, required water\nproduction per capita is expected to drop over time as a result of increased appreciation of the\nvalue of water developed by public awareness campaigns, improved efficiencies within the\ndelivery network, development of techniques of accounting for water, and freedom of choice on\nconsumption provided by metering and tariff policies that promote water conservation.", "16\nD.  Cost Estimates\n48. The total project cost is estimated at $65.5 million (at June 2001 prices), of which $32.9\nmillion or 50 percent is the foreign exchange cost and $32.6 million equivalent or 50 percent the\nlocal currency cost. A summary of the cost estimates is provided in Table 1 and detailed cost\nestimates are given in Appendix 5.\nTable 1: Cost Estimates\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total\nComponent Exchange Currency Cost\nA.

Financing Plan21\n49. The Government of Uzbekistan will provide $29.5 million equivalent counterpart funding\nto the Project and has requested a loan of $36.0 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources\nto help finance the balance. The ADB loan would finance the entire foreign exchange cost of\n$32.9 million and $3.1 million equivalent of the local currency cost. The local cost financing is\nconsidered justified because of the fiscal constraints faced by the local governments during the\ncountry\u2019s transition to a market economy. The ADB loan represents 55 percent of the total\ncost.22 The Borrower will be the Republic of Uzbekistan. The proposed loan will have a term of\n25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, with interest determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s\npool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans. The loan will carry a commitment\ncharge of 0.75 percent per annum and a front-end fee of 1 percent. The Borrower will enter into\nsubsidiary loan agreement with UCSA, the Executing Agency, under the ADB loan terms with\n                  \n21\nDuring loan negotiations, the availability of the new LIBOR-based loan product was discussed with the Government\nof Uzbekistan. The Government indicated that it is still reviewing the implications of the LIBOR-based loan product\nand will borrow under the pool-based loan facility for the proposed Project.\n22\nThe ADB cost-sharing limit under the Graduation Policy for Uzbekistan for 2001 is 45 percent. However, 55 percent\ncounterpart funding represents an extraordinarily high financial burden for the local governments whose revenues\nhave suffered significant erosion due to the impact of transition and adverse weather conditions in the last two\nyears.  Moreover,  investment  needs  for  building  urban  infrastructure  in  Uzbekistan  are  enormous.  Local\ngovernments are faced with binding budget constraints on account of rising levels of public expenditures to\nmaintain acceptable levels of delivery of public services. Increasing ADB\u2019s cost-sharing from 45 to 55 percent is\nrequired to meet the cost of the Project, which is essential to improve living conditions, reduce poverty, and\npromote economic development in the three cities. The Project was designed using the least-cost approach.", "17\nan additional charge not exceeding 0.2 percentage point on the ADB interest rate. UCSA will\nthen enter into subloan agreements with the vodokanals under the same terms. The vodokanals\nwill bear the foreign exchange and interest risk to be defined in the subsidiary loan agreements;\nthe loan repayment will be fixed in dollars and repaid at the prevailing commercial exchange\nrate.\n50. The Government has given assurance for the total counterpart funding requirement of\n$29.5  million.  UCSA,  the  three  oblast  governments,  and  the  three  city  governments  have\nprovided  written  guarantees  for  their  respective  counterpart  funding  commitments.  The\nproposed financing plan is summarized in Table 2 and details are in Appendix 5.\nTable 2: Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total Percent\nSource Exchange Currency Cost (%)\nA.

The Executing Agency\n51. UCSA, the Executing Agency for the Project, will have overall responsibility for project\ncoordination,  implementation,  and  liaison  with  ADB  and  other  government  ministries  and\ndepartments. UCSA is headed by a director general who is assisted by two deputies and 43\nprofessional management and technical staff (Appendix 2). The technical design institutes and\nthe center for developing norms, guidelines, and technical training report to UCSA. UCSA has\nconsiderable experience in dealing with rehabilitation and upgrading of urban infrastructure\nfacilities under its former capacity as the Ministry of Communal Services, which was responsible\nfor  O&M  of  all  communal  systems  and  services  throughout  the  country.  UCSA\u2019s  General\nDirectorate  on  Interregional  Water  Trunk  Mains  is  now  fully  responsible  for  the  national\ninterregional trunk water mains. Its implementation capabilities will be strengthened through the\nProject\u2019s capacity building activities. ADB and UCSA will enter into a project agreement. The\nPIUs and vodokanals in the three project cities will undertake detailed implementation activities.\nG.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Execution and Coordination\n52. Policy coordination and guidance for the Project will be assumed by an interministerial\nproject steering committee (PSC), headed by the UCSA director general. Members of the PSC\ninclude representatives from the Department of Foreign Economic Relations and Investment,\nMinistry of Macroeconomics and Statistics, Ministry of Finance, and the local governments of\nthe three project cities. The PSC has already been established under the project preparatory\nTA, by order of the Prime Minister, to provide direction on project preparation. During project\nimplementation, the PSC will be responsible for (i) setting policy guidelines for improving project\nimplementation, (ii) coordinating with other ministries and agencies, (iii) reviewing and approving", "18\nannual implementation plans, (iv) monitoring the progress of project implementation, and (v)\nacting as a tender committee to endorse contract awards. The PSC will meet at least once\nevery six months, or more frequently as required. The project implementation structure is in\nAppendix 6.\n53. A PMU under UCSA and three PIUs under each of the project city governments will be\nestablished prior to loan negotiations. The PMU will include about six full-time counterpart staff\nand consultants led by a project management specialist to manage and coordinate the work of\nthe three PIUs for Djizzak, Gulistan, and Karshi. The PMU will also be responsible for overall\ncoordination of procurement activities that need to be conducted in full compliance with ADB\nrequirements, operation of central procurement contracts, and awarding of consulting contracts.\nThe PIUs will be responsible for coordinating detailed implementation activities and will report to\nthe PMU. Responsibilities of the PIUs include financial management of project accounts, all\nlocal  procurement  including  civil  works  contracts,  and  coordination  of  project  design  and\nsupervision.  Each  of  the  PIUs  will  include  a  full-time  manager  and  about  five  full-time\ncounterpart staff and consultants. The three city vodokanals, with a total of about 700 staff\nincluding about 100 engineers (Appendix 2), and the UCSA General Directorate on Interregional\nWater Trunk Mains will be responsible for day-to-day project implementation activities and will\nreport, through the PIU, to the PMU and UCSA. They will be responsible for activities such as\nconstruction supervision, O&M of assets, and collection of tariffs. The roles and responsibilities\nof the PMU, PIUs, and implementing agencies are summarized in Appendix 6.\n2.  Budgetary Support and Channeling of Funds\n54. The PMU will undertake central procurement, including the capacity building component\nand the packages for materials and equipment. The PIU will undertake procurement of all other\ngoods and services and transfer the physical assets to the vodokanals. Counterpart funds\nincluding contributions from the national and local governments will be channeled to the PIUs\nthrough  regular  budgetary  allocations,  exemptions  from  taxes  and  duties,  and  small\ncontributions in kind. The ADB loan funds will be disbursed either through reimbursement to the\nPMU and PIUs or through direct payment to the contractors, suppliers, and consultants. Cost\nrecovery will be from the consumers, through the vodokanals by the collection of user charges.\nThe flow of funds is shown in Appendix 7.\n55. At the start of the Project, the PMU will help the three project city administrations\nformulate the draft project expenditures for all activities, with estimates for each year of project\nimplementation. These budgets will be reviewed and updated every six months and approved\nby  the  PMU  before  implementation.  Expenditures  will  be  recorded  at  source  by  the\nimplementing agencies, PIUs, and PMU. The PMU will approve and supervise all drawdown\narrangements. The PMU will be responsible for compiling project expenditures based on its own\nexpenditures  and  the  reports  of  expenditures  submitted  by  the  PIUs.  It  will  report  project\nexpenditures to UCSA and the PSC, with copies to ADB, on a monthly basis, with quarterly and\nannual summaries.\n3.  Anticorruption\n56. During project processing, ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to central and local\ngovernment officials. Attention was drawn to the sections on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines for Procurement, particularly the need for bidders, suppliers, and contractors to\nobserve the highest standards of ethics for the procurement and execution of ADB-financed\ncontracts,  and  the  sanctions  if  fraud  and  corruption  are  discovered.  The  anticorruption", "19\nprovisions  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  were  discussed.  The  project\nmanagement consulting services include assistance that will strengthen the implementation\narrangements, including internal auditing procedures. The international project management\nconsultants will assist in strengthening the procedures for the selection and engagement of\ndomestic consultants, increase transparency, and provide for equal opportunity competition.\nThe consultants will help to (i) strengthen the financial management system of the project\nvodokanals,  (ii)  conduct  training  to  promote  full  and  consistent  adherence  to  international\naccounting standards, and (iii) drafting procurement and bidding documents to strengthen the\nability  to  detect  fraud  and  corruption.  The  Government  is  increasingly  concerned  with\ngovernance  issues  and  has  committed  to  (i)  create  a  strong  mechanism  of  checks  and\nbalances, (ii) strengthen nongovernment and public associations, (iii) reinforce the legal basis\nfor reforms, (iv) support the gradual transfer of government powers of state bodies to citizens\u2019\nbodies for self-government and other nongovernment agencies, (v) encourage decentralization,\nand (vi) ensure the independence of the judiciary.23\n4.  Implementation Schedule\n57. The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  five  years.  Detailed  feasibility  and  detailed\nengineering design will commence early in 2002 and tendering of contracts will commence in\nthe last quarter of 2002. Construction of the water supply and distribution facilities will begin in\nmid-2003 and be completed by mid-2006. Installation of meters is targeted for completion by the\nend of 2005, and testing to be completed by 2006. All components will be implemented in the\nthree project cities simultaneously. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 8.\n5.  Procurement\n58. The procurement of goods and services financed by the ADB loan will be undertaken in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts valued over $1.0\nmillion  and  equipment  contracts  above  $500,000  will  be  undertaken  through  international\ncompetitive bidding procedures. Civil works contracts valued at $1.0 million or less will be\ncarried out under local competitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB and in accordance\nwith  Government  regulations.  Equipment  packages  valued  at  or  under  $500,000  will  be\nprocured following international shopping procedures. Procurement notice for contracts to be\nawarded on the basis of international competitive bidding will be submitted to ADB within 90\ndays before the issuance of the prequalification invitation or invitation to bid for the Project. The\nproposed procurement packages and their estimated costs are provided in Appendix 9.\n6.  Consulting Services\n59. The Project will require consulting services in the fields of project management, water\nsupply engineering, health and public awareness education, financial and accounting advice,\nand community development. Consulting services will assist in (i) preparing detailed feasibility\nand engineering design studies, including socioeconomic, technical, and environmental surveys;\n(ii)  applying  water  supply  system  design  standards;  (iii)  preparing  contract  packages  and\ndocuments;  (iv)  evaluating  project  activities;  (v)  supporting  the  institutional  development\nprogram,  including  training  for  unaccounted  for  water  loss  reduction;  (vi)  supporting  the\nmanagement and activities of the PMU and PIUs; (vii) helping staff prepare loan withdrawal\napplications and supporting documents; and (viii) maintaining accurate and sufficient accounts\nfor the Project and the vodokanals, in accordance with international accounting standards. A\n                  \n23 Resolution No. 296 of the Cabinet of Ministers, sections 1.1-1.2, 10 June 1999.", "20\ntotal of 405 person-months (45 person-months international and 360 person-months domestic)\nof consulting services are required. The international consultants will be involved in project\nmanagement; development of financial management practices to international standards with\ndomestic consultants and government staff; financial, technical, and institutional strengthening;\nand community development activities to ensure project quality. The domestic consultants will\nbe responsible for long-term project implementation, reviewing technical studies, preparing and\ncommissioning  detailed  designs,  and  supervising  construction.  The  PMU  will  contract  with\nsuitable NGOs and CBOs to implement community consultation and development. UCSA will\nengage the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother arrangements acceptable to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The terms\nof reference for the consultants are in Appendix 10.\n60. The consultants will also be responsible for implementing the capacity building program,\nwhich will include training of local governments and vodokanals on O&M and management of\nwater supply systems. The program will focus on (i) gradual expansion of the organizational\nstructure, including identification of key staff to be hired; (ii) O&M with emphasis on demand\nmanagement  and  asset  management  planning,  including  reduction  of  wastage  and\nunaccounted for water; and (iii) development of capabilities, including planning, engineering,\nfinancial, accounting, billing, tariff setting and collection, and operations. Water supply system\noperators in the vodokanals will be trained during project implementation. About 1,100 staff in\nthe local governments and vodokanals will be trained under the capacity building program. The\ntraining will be carried out in conjunction with the physical implementation of the Project. In\naddition, training will also be provided by local NGOs and CBOs on strengthening the capacity\nof communities to be involved in community development and consumer empowerment through\nconsumer committees. The PMU and PIUs will continue development of the training program\nand will implement the training program.\n61. The PMU and PIUs, in coordination with the health department in each project city and\nwith assistance from the consultants, will work with NGOs to develop hygiene and health\nawareness programs (including water quality testing) for the health department and CBOs, such\nas mahallas. The programs will include (i) communication campaigns to educate the population\non the causes, effects, and prevention of waterborne and related diseases; (ii) specification and\nstandard setting for health awareness campaigns in areas such as maintenance of sanitation\nfacilities, food storage and preparation, and personal hygiene in houses and small businesses;\nand (iii) communication and training programs for local NGO staff and volunteers, including\nwomen\u2019s and youth groups to implement the programs with the community in the project cities.\nNGOs will also be involved in providing training to individuals to undertake plumbing repair\nworks in houses and apartment units.\n7.  Disbursements\n62. The  PMU  and  PIUs  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  disbursement  projections,\nrequesting budgetary allocations for the counterpart funds, collecting supporting documents,\npreparing withdrawal applications, and sending them to ADB in accordance with the ADB Loan\nDisbursement Handbook. To facilitate implementation of the Project, an imprest account may be\nestablished. Because this is UCSA\u2019s first experience with implementing an externally financed\ninvestment project, its financial and accounting management capacity is yet to be tested. The\nimprest  account  will  be  established  only  after  the  fielding  of  the  project-financed  financial\nmanagement advise and the establishment of adequate financial and accounting controls. The\ninitial ceiling of the imprest account will be $100,000. The imprest account will be established,\nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook", "21\nand with detailed arrangements agreed to by the Government and ADB. ADB\u2019s statement of\nexpenditures procedure will be used to liquidate advances from the imprest account.\n8.  Accounts, Audits, and Reports\n63. The Government will ensure records and accounts adequate to identify the goods and\nservices financed from the loan proceeds will be maintained. The PIUs will maintain separate\nproject accounts, in coordination with the PMU, which will prepare the project accounts and\nrelated  financial  statements,  including  imprest  account  and  records  of  the  statement  of\nexpenditures. Project accounts and financial statements of the three project vodokanals will be\naudited  annually  in  accordance  with  sound  auditing  standards  by  independent  auditors\nacceptable to ADB. Certified copies of such audited accounts and financial statements will be\nsubmitted to ADB within nine months after the close of each fiscal year. All such reports and\nstatements will be submitted in English. The Government has agreed to finance the costs\nrelated to the annual auditing from the loan proceeds. UCSA and the implementing agencies\nwere informed of ADB\u2019s new policy on submission of audited financial statements and the strict\npenalties for noncompliance. The PMU and ADB may review and audit these records on a\nrandom basis.\n64. The  PIUs,  in  coordination  with  the  PMU,  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the\nimplementation of project-funded activities. The reports will be in a format acceptable to ADB\nand will indicate, among other things, progress made against established targets, problems\nencountered during the quarter, steps taken and steps proposed to resolve the problems,\ncompliance with loan covenants, and project activities to be undertaken during the next quarter.\nA project completion report will be prepared within three months of project completion. All\nreports will be submitted in English.\n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation\na.  Annual Operation Plans and Financial Review\n65. To facilitate project implementation and decentralization of communal services, both the\ncentral Government and the local governments of Djizzak, Gulistan, and Karshi will prepare by\n31 December of each year an operation plan for the next fiscal year. The plan will include (i)\nproposed  budgetary  allocations  for  communal  services,  and  specifically,  the  allocation  of\nsufficient counterpart funds from local and central governments and other sources for timely\nproject  implementation;  (ii)  status  of  policy  actions;  and  (iii)  financing  plan  for  the  project\nactivities for the succeeding year. The plan will confirm that the Government has allocated an\nadequate budget for financing project implementation and recurrent costs.\nb.  Project Performance Monitoring System\n66. The PIUs will implement a project performance monitoring system (PPMS) for each\nproject component to evaluate the delivery of the planned facilities and the project benefits\naccrued. The PMU, with the assistance of the consultants, will develop comprehensive PPMS\nprocedures  and  plans  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  handbook  within  six  months  after  loan\neffectiveness.  The  PIUs  will  carry  out  PPMS  activities,  including  the  establishment  of\nbenchmarks, collection of information, monitoring of benefits, and evaluation of social impact.\nData collection will be carried out prior to the start of the physical implementation of the Project\nand  in  conjunction  with  socioeconomic  surveys  and  focus  group  discussions.  It  will  then", "22\ncontinue  on  a  regular  basis  during  project  implementation  until  three  months  after  project\ncompletion. The results will be incorporated into the project progress and completion reports.\nc.  Annual and Midterm Review\n67. ADB  and  the  Government  will  jointly  undertake  annual  project  reviews  to  assess\nprogress, identify constraints, and agree on strategies for resolving such constraints. More than\none review per year is expected for the first two years. In addition, ADB and the Government will\ncarry out a comprehensive midterm review in the third year of project implementation (2004).\nThe Government will ensure that the midterm review is informed of any policy or implementation\nchanges affecting the local governments and the urban infrastructure sector, and if necessary,\nrecommend changes in design and implementation. The midterm review will (i) review the\nscope, design, and implementation arrangements of the Project; (ii) identify changes needed\nsince the time of project appraisal; (iii) assess implementation performance against project\nindicators; (iv) review and establish compliance with loan covenants; and (v) identify problems\nand  constraints  and,  if  necessary,  recommend  changes  in  the  design  or  implementation\narrangements.\n10.  Advance Action\n68. ADB  management  has  approved  advance  action  to  recruit  consulting  services  for\nimplementation assistance and the preparation of detailed designs and contract documents\nprior to loan effectiveness. The Government has been informed that approval of advance action\ndoes not commit ADB to finance the whole or any part of the Project.\n11.  Community Participation\n69. A  participatory  approach  was  adopted  to  formulate  and  design  the  Project.  A\ncomprehensive socioeconomic survey and focus group discussions with low-income people\nwere carried out in each of the three project cities to determine the real demands of the people.\nThe survey results indicate that the majority of respondents wished to have improved basic\nwater supply services and expressed their willingness to pay user fees for better services.\nNGOs and CBOs, including women\u2019s groups and focus groups in the three project cities, were\nalso consulted during project formulation and expressed a strong commitment to participate in\nproject design and implementation. The PIUs, with assistance from the project consultants, will\nset  up  consumer  committees  (one  per  city)  to  participate  in  project  implementation  and\nmonitoring. These committees will include representatives from all consumer groups, including\nthe mahalla aksakal (elder) committees, housing partnerships, city women\u2019s committee, city\noffices of the ministries of health and education, and NGOs involved in project implementation.\nA particular focus of the participatory program will be on meeting and prioritizing the needs of\nthe poor. Furthermore, the attached TA and the capacity building program of the Project will\nprovide training and support for local NGOs and CBOs to strengthen the capabilities of the\nconsumer committees to participate in managing and maintaining urban water supply services\nin the long term.\n70. The  main  selection  criteria  for  NGO  participation  in  the  Project  will  be  (i)  a  well-\nestablished track record of activities and social networks within the project cities, (ii) experience\nin  public  health  and/or  small  business  development,  (iii)  experience  in  mounting  publicity\ncampaigns, (iv) evidence of involvement of women and people of all ethnic origins in the project\narea,  (v)  experience  in  keeping  accounts  and  making  progress  reports,  (vi)  willingness  to", "23\nreceive specialist training from national or international NGOs, and (vii) ability to commit the\nneeded staff resources full-time for the required duration of the Project.\n12.  Private Sector Participation\n71. Infrastructure  development  requires  supply  of  equipment,  materials,  and  contracting\nservices. A strong support industry is an essential element for good utility performance. A\nprivate support industry for the urban infrastructure sector is evolving only slowly in Uzbekistan.\nMost services are delivered through state agencies, publicly owned self-financing organizations,\nor recently privatized companies that provide similar services as were offered by the former\nstate-owned enterprises, institutes, and ministries. Greater private sector participation will result\nin competition that allows utilities and consumers to choose the best contract in terms of quality\nand cost. Through the Project, the Government will be encouraging the development of (i) a\ndiversified private consulting capacity by contracting research and design institutes that are\nprivatized or operate on market principles; (ii) a responsive and efficient domestic industry to\nsupply  quality  equipment  and  materials  by  procuring  from  privatized  state  equipment\nmanufacturers and material suppliers; (iii) civil works contractors that are capable of providing\nquality  services  by  contracting  the  privatized  state  civil  works  contractors;  (iv)  small-scale\nenterprises  that  can  offer  construction  and  O&M  services;  (v)  NGOs  that  can  help  the\ncommunities to maintain the infrastructure facilities; and (vi) local consulting businesses, survey\ncompanies, and individuals. In future years the project approach is expected to allow the\nimplementing and operating agencies, the vodokanals, to restructure and contract out some of\ntheir services such as the collection of tariffs, repairs and maintenance, and potentially, contract\nmanagement  and  financial  services.  The  establishment  of  consumer  committees  is  also\nexpected to strengthen demand-led private sector participation.\n13.  Operation and Maintenance\n72. To ensure sustainable O&M, the project design incorporates systematic training of staff;\npreparation of manuals; and periodic monitoring of operations, including consumer satisfaction.\nThe vodokanals will be responsible for the O&M of the facilities and collection of user fees on a\nregular monthly basis. The community participation program to be undertaken during project\nimplementation will facilitate beneficiary involvement, enable the determination of an appropriate\nand affordable service level, and help ensure that the costs of investment and O&M are fully\nunderstood. Furthermore, a customer service orientation program will be included for utility\nagencies to regularly monitor the level of customer satisfaction, which has a direct impact on\nwillingness to pay, tariff collection, and cost recovery.\n14.  Cost Recovery\n73. Full recovery from user charges is targeted for all three cities to ensure financial viability\nof the Project and sustainability of the vodokanals. Tariffs will be increased for all categories of\ncustomers, and after the installation of meters for residential customers under the Project, all\ncustomers  will  be  charged  by  volume.  Once  the  Project  is  completed,  tariff  collection  will\nimprove due to better service delivery and customer orientation, restructuring of tariffs based on\nconsumption, more transparent billing, establishment of consumer committees, and education\nand  awareness  campaign.  Tariffs  will  be  set  to  cover  O&M,  interest  on  the  ADB  loan,\ndepreciation, and a profit margin, and will take into consideration the tariff collection rate and the\nprevailing  commercial  exchange  rate.  At  these  tariff  levels,  the  vodokanals  would  be  fully\nsustainable, and be able to repay interest and principal of the ADB loan to UCSA and cover its\nown costs.", "24\n74. Under the Government reform policy to transform vodokanals to become financially\nindependent, utility agencies must take on the foreign exchange risk. Proposed tariff calculation\ntakes into consideration devaluation of the sum at the commercial exchange rate of $1 to\nSUM700 (provided by the Ministry of Finance) in 2001 to $1 to SUM1,100 in 2007 when loan\nrepayment commences. Tariff collection is targeted at 100 percent. However, proposed tariff\ncalculation includes a conservative assumption of 65 percent in the early years of operation\nrising to 75 percent by 2010. The proposed tariff structure will achieve full cost recovery.\nProposed average tariffs per m3 in 2007 in constant prices are SUM103 in Djizzak, SUM119 in\nGulistan, and SUM95 in Karshi, (equivalent to about $0.14 to $0.17 at the commercial exchange\nrate). To improve affordability, nonresidential customers are proposed to continue to cross-\nsubsidize residential customers and a lifeline tariff for residential customers is proposed to\nassist those on low incomes. Under this tariff structure, the proposed household charge for\naverage water consumption will be in the order of SUM687 to SUM932 (equivalent to about\n$1.00 to $1.40 at the commercial exchange rate) per month in constant 2001 prices. These\nrepresent an increase of about 2.3 to 2.8 times the current charge and are about 4 to 5 percent\nof  average  household  income.  Nonresidential  tariffs  will  be  about  SUM150  to  SUM190\n(equivalent to $0.22 to $0.28 at the commercial exchange rate) per m3 in constant 2001 prices.\n75. Since required tariff levels are sensitive to changes in production, losses, consumption,\ncollection  rates,  actual  costs,  and  inflation  among  other  factors,  tariffs  must  be  reviewed\nregularly, and appropriate tariffs implemented, both during project construction and beyond\n2007. In particular, the implication of the vodokanals bearing the foreign exchange risk is that\ntariffs will need to increase more in order to meet loan repayments if the commercial exchange\nrate depreciates further than anticipated. If the vodokanals are not able to bear the full debt\nservice of the loan and continue to adequately operate and maintain the water supply system,\nthe  central  Government  would  consider  subsidizing  their  debt  service  requirement.  The\nGovernment agreed that the vodokanals should prioritize O&M expenditure to ensure that\nexisting and future service delivery is sustainable.\nH.  Environmental and Social Measures\n1.  Environmental Impacts\n76. Each of the water supply components in the project cities, and the Project as a whole,\nwill  generate  positive  environmental  impacts.  Being  a  category  B  project,  an  initial\nenvironmental examination was undertaken using criteria specified in ADB\u2019s Environmental\nGuidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects (Appendix 11). None of the components will\ncause  significant  adverse  environmental  impacts  based  on  the  screening  of  possible\nenvironmental consequences using ADB checklists. The components will reduce per capita\nwater  consumption  (and  unaccounted  for  water),  and  will  reduce  energy  requirements  by\nimproving efficiency of equipment and operation of distribution networks. The quality of water\nreleased into the distribution networks will be improved with less likelihood for the spread of\nwaterborne diseases. None of the Project\u2019s physical construction activities will permanently\nadversely affect natural or cultural resources, or sensitive ecological zones, and no resettlement\nof residents or affected persons is required.\n77. Temporary and local problems, such as traffic disruption and removal of topsoil, will\noccur  during  construction  works.  These  are  routine,  minor  problems  that  will  not  have  a\nsignificant impact on the population. The vodokanals and their contractors are well experienced\nin  managing  construction  activities  to  mitigate  such  problems.  Operational  problems  are\nunlikely. Where new equipment is installed, the operators will receive O&M training. Improved", "25\nefficiency in all phases of the services combined with tariff reforms will improve the generation\nof revenues to sustain adequate O&M levels. The vodokanals, working in conjunction with\ndesign institutes, have the capability to assess environmental impacts of the activities, and to\nprepare the statements of environmental impacts and consequences required by Uzbekistan\nlaw. Careful control of the discharge of rainwater from trenches or flushing waters from mains\nwill be exercised during construction operations to follow existing regulations and procedures.\nSafety  officers  in  the  utility  agencies  will  be  included  in  training  provided  to  operators  of\nequipment under the Project, to ensure proper mitigation of potential hazardous situations.\n2.  Social Measures\n78. A social analysis following ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Incorporation of Social Dimensions and\nHandbook for Incorporation of Social Dimensions in Projects was undertaken to evaluate the\nstatus of water supply and other urban infrastructure service delivery and the demands of the\npeople, including the poor, living in the project cities. Views of the community concerned were\nobtained regarding their infrastructure service needs and willingness to pay fees for improved\nservices. The results of the social analysis are incorporated in project formulation as outlined in\nAppendix 12. The social analysis indicates that the potential beneficiaries show a high level of\ninterest and support for each project component. Implementation of the Project does not require\nany resettlement.\n79. A random survey of the target population was conducted to yield information pertinent to\ndesigning aspects of the Project that would address the needs of the poor. The findings of the\nsurvey provided a socioeconomic profile (para. 36 and Appendix 12), which provided the basis\nfor  including  the  specific  social  measures  described  in  para.  45.  Such  elements  are\nmechanisms to ensure that all consumers, particularly the poor and women, will be able to\nparticipate in project implementation, receive the benefits of improved water supply, and are\nwilling and can afford to pay for the water services (paras. 45 and 69). The formation of\nconsumer committees and related support for their activities is consistent with the cultural\ntradition of community participation, embodied in the mahalla committee system (footnote 8).\nWomen\u2019s  involvement  will  be  facilitated  through  the  committee  members\u2019  capacity  to\nincorporate  best  practices  in  organizing  and  training  aspects,  and  also  to  ensure  their\nmembership will include ethnic minority groups in the target population. These features are\nexpected  to  serve  as  the  keystone  for  (i)  bridging  service  providers  with  consumers;  (ii)\ncoordinating  with  line  ministries  responsible  for  promoting  water  conservation  awareness,\ndrinking water, and health standards; and (iii) providing a voice for the target population to alert\nthe responsible authorities to their particular needs or problems. In short, these built-in features\nare socially sound and will encourage stakeholder ownership and accountability for project\nimplementation.\nI.  Technical Assistance\n80. The Government requested advisory TA for capacity building of urban water supply\ndelivery and services, to be processed in conjunction with the Project. The TA\u2019s main objective\nis to strengthen sector institutions and train concerned staff at various levels of government in\nappropriate management systems for delivering sustainable urban water supply services. The\nTA will also initiate systems for involving the community in the planning of the services to be\nprovided by mobilizing and training NGOs and CBOs to undertake this work under the Project.\nThe services provided under the TA will encompass (i) international and domestic consulting\nservices;  (ii)  training  of  government  and  vodokanal  staff,  and  community  leaders;  and  (iii)\nestablishment of a training center through which the training activities can be coordinated.", "26\n81. UCSA will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The PSC established for the Project will\nalso supervise TA implementation to maximize use of TA findings in local government reform.\nThe main beneficiaries will be the consumers who receive improved services as a result of the\nimplementation  of  better  management  systems.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  seven\nmonths, commencing in the second month after loan effectiveness. It will require 17 person-\nmonths of international consulting inputs and 32 person-months of domestic consulting inputs in\nthe  areas  of  project  management  and  training  for  institutional  development,  financial\nmanagement, community participation, and water supply engineering. The consultants will be\nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants  and  other\narrangements for the engagement of domestic consultants.\n82. The TA is estimated to cost $860,000 equivalent, of which $513,500 is the foreign\nexchange  cost  and  $346,500  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  Of  this  cost,  $600,000\nequivalent will be funded by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, financed by the\nGovernment of Japan. This includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $86,500 equivalent of\nthe local currency cost. The Government will finance the remaining $260,000 equivalent of local\ncurrency cost, representing expenditures (in kind or cash) for remuneration and travel cost of\ncounterpart staff, translation, interpretation of government documents, administrative support,\noffice  space,  and  furniture.  A  detailed  TA  description  and  terms  of  reference  is  given  in\nAppendix 13.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses\n1.  Economic Analysis\n83. Urban  water  supply  services  in  the  project  cities  are  inadequate.  Assets  have\ndeteriorated and lack of maintenance is such that service delivery of water is severely affected.\nWithout major investment in the near future the central water supply will continue to deteriorate\nrapidly,  with  serious  consequences  for  economic  activity  and  livelihood.  Currently,  water\nrationing occurs in all three cities.  Water shortages, cuts, and pressure problems mean that\nonly about 60 percent of the population receive some water every day. Without the Project, by\n2007, the water supply system in Djizzak and Karshi will probably fail to supply even basic water\nrequirements and 30 percent of the population will not have access to a piped water supply.\nThis proportion of households without access to a piped water supply is expected to gradually\nincrease, until the system totally fails, which is expected within 15 years. In Gulistan, the\nsituation is even more severe, where without the Project, by 2007, 100 percent of households\nwill be without access to a piped water supply, since total failure of the system is expected\nwithin five years. The Project is considered high priority by the Government, is timely, and well\nintegrated with other investment activity. The Project will benefit about 484,000 residential water\nsupply customers, industries, small businesses, and other organizations in the three cities.\nAccess to a clean, safe, and reliable water supply system will benefit poor and nonpoor alike as\nthey are not geographically separated and all households will have access to the improved\nsystem.\n84. The  water  supply  components  will  (i)  generate  major  efficiency  gains,  reducing\ndistribution leakage, and water and electricity costs; (ii) improve cost recovery through better\ncustomer satisfaction with service delivery; (iii) reduce natural resource depletion; (iv) improve\npublic health by reducing the incidence of waterborne diseases; and (v) support economic", "27\nrecovery.  Unaccounted for water will be reduced from an estimated more than 40 percent, to a\ntarget of 30 percent in 2007.\n85. An analysis of alternatives was undertaken. Djizzak has no alternative water source in\nthe short to medium term; the only alternative water source from the Zarafshan river scheme will\nnot be available within the time frame of this Project. In Gulistan, two specific alternatives were\nconsidered,  including  total  reliance  on  the  borehole  field  at  Dehkanabad  (under  the\nresponsibility of UCSA) and total reliance on borehole fields under the responsibility of the city\nvodokanal. However, both alternatives are about 10 percent more expensive and the chosen\nscheme is more acceptable in terms of implementation. In Karshi, the unit costs of the chosen\nscheme were about 10 percent cheaper than the next best alternative. The consideration of\nalternative sources was strengthened by the choice of the most cost-effective rehabilitation of\nthe distribution system. Only items that were considered essential for establishing a sustainable\nsystem were included in the project design.\n86. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) calculation was undertaken in constant 2001\nprices  using  the  domestic  price  numeraire,  since  the  outputs  are  nontradable  in  nature.\nEconomic costs, excluding taxes and financial prices, are converted using factors of (i) 2.0 for\nthe  shadow  exchange  rate  factor  (SERF)  and  (ii)  0.8  for  labor.  Nonincremental  economic\nbenefits that were valued include (i) use of bottled water, (ii) time savings for water collection,\n(iii)  industrial  resource  cost  savings,  and  (iv)  savings  of  health  expenditure.  Incremental\neconomic benefits that were valued include (i) residential willingness to pay, and (ii) increases in\nsmall business output.\n87. The EIRR is 18.2 percent in Djizzak, 17.2 percent in Gulistan, and 24.4 percent in\nKarshi.  For the three cities the EIRR exceeds the economic opportunity cost of capital, which is\nassumed to be 12 percent. Standard sensitivity tests were undertaken to consider the impact of\neconomic risks, encompassed in adverse cost and benefit scenarios and delays in benefits.\nSince  the  economic  risk  is  considered  to  be  higher  than  for  standard  ADB  projects,  the\nsensitivity tests were set at 20 percent. In addition, for each city, project-specific sensitivity tests\nwere  undertaken.  These  include  (i)  a  higher  SERF,  equivalent  to  the  use  of  the  market\nexchange rate, (ii) increases in key O&M costs, and (iii) decreases in demand for bottled\nwater\u2014the most sensitive valued benefit. Under all the sensitivity tests, the components were\nfound to be economically viable. Sensitivity indicators and switching values were calculated for\nstandard sensitivity tests and for the SERF. The SERF would need to exceed 4.0, for the EIRR\nto fall below the economic opportunity cost of capital. A summary of the economic analysis is in\nAppendix 14.\n2.  Financial Analysis\n88. Project financial appraisal was undertaken for each component, comparing the financial\ninternal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  with  the  weighted  average  cost  of  capital;  and  the  average\nincremental cost with the average incremental revenue. Costs include capital costs in line with\nthe implementation schedule, operational costs, and replacement costs. Estimates of O&M\ncosts consider improvements in efficiency, particularly in the use of electricity, volume of water\nproduced, and specific maintenance requirements for the facilities created under the Project.\nOnly additional costs resulting from the Project were included in the FIRR calculation.\n89. Revenues come from direct user charges at an assumed collection rate of 65 percent.\nThis is a considerable improvement on the current collection rate, which is about 30 to 40\npercent. Tariffs are assumed to stay constant in real terms beyond 2007.", "28\n90. The FIRR is 9.5 percent in Djizzak, 9.5 percent in Gulistan, and 8.4 percent in Karshi.\nAll exceed the weighted average cost of capital, which is about 5.0 percent, demonstrating that\nat  proposed  tariff  levels  the  Project  is  financially  viable.  Switching  values  and  sensitivity\nindicators were tested, and the components were found to be financially viable under adverse\ncost and revenue scenarios.\n91. Financial projections were prepared for the vodokanals for 2001 to 2017, 10 years after\nproject  completion.  Existing  cash  flow  difficulties  are  expected  to  continue  during  project\nimplementation since poor service delivery is one of the main reasons for low tariff collection.\nThis should not affect project implementation since all counterpart funds are externally financed\nand  project  assets  will  be  transferred  to  the  vodokanals.  However,  once  service  delivery\nimproves and new charging arrangements and tariff increases are in place in 2007, the financial\nperformance of the vodokanal is acceptable and key ratios satisfy requirements. The debt\nservice ratios exceed 1.2; debt-equity ratios are less than one; and the vodokanals make a\nsmall profit in the years after project implementation. Detailed financial analysis is in Appendix\n15.\n3.  Affordability Analysis and Project Sustainability\n92. As discussed in para. 73, full cost recovery from user charges is targeted for all three\ncities to ensure project sustainability and operation of the utility agencies. At the same time, the\npoor must be protected from the increase in charges. Current tariff is based on a flat per capita\ncharge irrespective of the volume of water consumed. The proposed tariff structure will charge\ncustomers  by  volume  of  water  used  and  a  lifeline  tariff  is  proposed  for  low  consumption\nhouseholds. An affordability analysis has been undertaken to assess whether the proposed tariff\nis affordable to residential consumers, based on estimated tariffs and household income data\nfrom the social survey. Since a single tariff is neither appropriate nor affordable, a tariff structure\nhas been prepared for each city, based on the assessment of average required tariff and the\ndemand for water use by customer type. The proposed structure includes a lifeline tariff set at\n75 lcd, a tariff for consumption between 75 lcd and 125 lcd, and a higher tariff for consumption\nover 125 lcd. Different tariffs will be charged for residential and nonresidential consumers.\n93. Average household charges were compared with willingness-to-pay. Results from the\nhousehold survey showed that households were willing to pay an average of SUM1,054 per\nmonth for water. Proposed charges for average water consumption ranging from SUM687 to\nSUM957 per household are below the average willingness-to-pay.\n94. Proposed average household charges were also compared with average household\nincome. Water charges for less than 5 percent of income are considered to be affordable, in line\nwith ADB affordability criteria. Proposed charges are 4 percent of household income in Djizzak,\n5 percent in Gulistan, and 4 percent in Karshi. For very low-income residents, proposed charges\nfor 75 lcd were compared with the income of the poorest 10 percent of households. Proposed\ncharges are lower than 5 percent of household income in the three project cities. Detailed\naffordability analysis is in Appendix 16.\nB.  Environment\n95. The Project\u2019s physical components will have no adverse impact on the environment.\nMost of the physical work is rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. New construction comprises\ntrunk mains, closed water reservoirs, and additions to municipal distribution networks. These\nworks will not encroach on sensitive ecological, cultural, or historical sites. The Project is", "29\nexpected to have positive impact on the environment by improving the quality of delivered water\nand the efficiency of service operation. The abstraction and production of water will more closely\nmatch  consumer  demand  by  reducing  inefficiencies  and  losses.  Similarly,  electrical  power\nconsumption  will  be  optimized.  The  use  of  metering  and  consumption-based  billing  will\nencourage conservation by users. Continuous environmental monitoring will be undertaken as\npart  of  the  project  performance  monitoring  system  to  ensure  construction  quality  and\nenvironmental management meets national standards.\nC.  Social Dimensions\n1.  Social Impact\n96. Twenty-four hour provision of safe drinking water will make a significant positive impact\non the lives of people in all income groups (especially women). Public health will improve\nsignificantly, and indirectly less income will be spent on medical services, school days, and\nworkdays lost due to sickness related to waterborne diseases. Better water supply also means\nimproved treatment facilities for patients in hospital. Based on research in the country,24 the\nincidence of hepatitis A and dysentery will decrease by about 60 percent and typhoid by 90\npercent with the provision of a chlorinated piped water supply system. Implementation of health\nawareness programs under the Project will enhance the benefits. Project benefits will be further\nenhanced by the creation of potential jobs in small plumbing repairs. Small businesses such as\nrestaurants and hairdressers that rely on continuous water supply will also benefit.\n2.  Poverty Impact\n97. Despite the lack of an agreed or official poverty line, an assessment of absolute poverty\nwas undertaken to estimate the proportion of poor and nonpoor beneficiaries. All available data,\nincluding data on income, expenditure, and quality of life, was reviewed. The problems involved\nin defining a poverty line include (i) the use of official statistics that are not always reliable; (ii)\nthe use of narrow definitions of poverty that tend to ignore the economic, cultural, and social\nsituation in the project area and the difficulty of measuring nonmonetary benefits; and (iii)\nunregistered income, which may form a significant part of actual income levels. For the purpose\nof estimating the proportion of poor beneficiaries in the Project, a poverty line of SUM4,000 per\ncapita per month has been used (paras. 11 and 12). Based on this poverty line the social survey\nindicates that about 45 percent of the total 484,000 project beneficiaries in the three cities are\npoor. The proportion of poor households is 37 percent in Djizzak, 44 percent in Gulistan, and 51\npercent in Karshi. However, the Project will improve the water supply service to all beneficiaries\nwhether defined as poor or not. The difference between the poor and nonpoor is that the poor\nare the least likely to be able to cope when water supply services break down as they cannot\nafford to pay for alternatives. Service delivery of water will worsen if the Project does not\nproceed,  as  facilities  will  continue  to  deteriorate  and  the  service  will  become  increasingly\nintermittent or fail completely.\n98. The Project will benefit the poor by improving the quality of urban water services. This\nwill not directly generate income or give people the means to pull themselves out of poverty but\nwill improve their quality of life. Moreover, since the impact of not undertaking the Project may\nresult in a failure of city water supply, the consequence would be more poor people deprived a\n                  \n24\nAmerican Society of Tropical Disease Medicine and Hygiene; Ministry of Health, Uzbekistan; Swiss Disaster Relief\nCenter; US Center for Disease Control and Prevention; and US Agency for International Development. 1998.\nWater Distribution System and Diarrheal Disease Transmission: A Case Study in Uzbekistan. Tashkent.", "30\nbasic need, therefore the overall impact of the Project is pro-poor and positive. The Project will\nbenefit poor households by introducing a tariff structure that charges by volume of water used\nand a lifeline tariff for low consumption households. Quality of life measures related to water\nsupply for households appropriate for the Project include (i) access to safe drinking water; (ii)\naccess to washing facilities; (iii) morbidity level due to exposure to waterborne diseases (para.\n96); and (iv) proportion of day spent on water collection, i.e., loss of productive time. Time saved\nfrom collecting water will be about 70 to 80 minutes per day. Area targeting of low-income\nhouseholds is not achievable in Uzbekistan as low-income and middle-income households live\nside by side in the cities. The lack of a housing market together with Uzbek cultural norms of\nattachment  to  land  have  restricted  the  movement  of  higher  income  households  to\nneighborhoods with better services. However, while middle and higher income households are\nable to purchase alternative services, e.g., large water storage containers and water pumps,\nlower  income  households  are  more  vulnerable  to  service  deficiencies  as  these  coping\nmechanisms are unaffordable. These families are more vulnerable to sickness and are likely to\nspend a large proportion of their income on medical treatment. This sickness can lead to\ncomparatively  low  school  attendance  and  decreased  ability  to  learn  or  to  be  involved  in\nproductive  work.  The  Project  will  also  create  construction-related  job  opportunities  for  the\nunemployed  skilled  and  unskilled  laborers  during  the  implementation  stage.  About  2,100\nperson-months of skilled employment and about 5,000 person-months of unskilled employment\nwill be created by the Project. The results of the poverty impact assessment are in Appendix 17.\n3.  Gender and Development\n99. The Project will benefit women as they are traditionally responsible for cooking and\ncleaning and taking care of the family, and are highly affected by problems associated with\nwater supply. Survey data show that around 13 percent of all households in autumn and 35\npercent  of  households  in  summer  could  not  get  water  from  taps  inside  their  homes.\nConsequently, women, particularly those in lower income households, spend a large proportion\nof their time collecting water and often walk considerable distances to collect it as they cannot\nafford to buy water storage tanks. One third of all households indicated that they walk more than\n200 meters to collect water, often making several trips per day, when water is not available in\ntheir houses. The average time spent per day collecting water is about 45 minutes in winter and\nabout 85 minutes in summer. Women also dominate the teaching profession and teachers\nreported that they have to organize lessons around water supply schedules. The improvement\nof the water supply system to ensure continuous supply throughout the year will significantly\nreduce time spent collecting water and will directly benefit women and children who share the\nprimary responsibility for carrying water to the household. Women will also receive training\nunder the Project\u2019s capacity building program and through their participation in the consumer\ncommittees.\nD. Risks\n100. Five  possible  risks  have  been  identified:  (i)  delay  in  project  implementation  due  to\ninadequate counterpart funds; (ii) lack of institutional capacity, particularly at the local level, and\nexperience  in  implementing  large  projects  and  lack  of  knowledge  of  ADB  procedures;  (iii)\ninability to set and collect tariffs to achieve the tariff collection rate target because of consumers\u2019\nunwillingness to pay; (iv) the benefit of the lifeline tariff may not reach poor households in\napartment buildings as individual water meters will not be installed in each apartment unit due to\nhigh cost (footnote 20); and (v) devaluation of the currency because of the unification of the\nofficial and commercial exchange rates.", "31\n101. The possibility of delay in implementation due to lack of counterpart funds has been\naddressed. The central and local governments and utility agencies have a written commitment\nto provide the necessary counterpart funds through taxes, duties, and budgetary allocations that\ninclude  contributions  in  kind.  Measures  to  reduce  possible  delays,  including  delays  in\ncounterpart funds, have been discussed with the Government. A clear delineation of agency\nresponsibilities and appropriate mechanisms for coordination has been identified to avoid the\nrisk of delay in implementation. The issue of financial capability has been dealt with by including\nthe capacity building program, which should strengthen the capacity to cope with O&M of the\nimproved systems. A comprehensive training program is included as a major project component\nto assist in project implementation. Through O&M training, the vodokanals will be trained to\nensure their effectiveness in project implementation and O&M. The capacity building component\nwill  comprise  customer  service  training  and  regular  monitoring  of  customer  satisfaction  to\nimprove service delivery and consumers\u2019 willingness to pay. Social surveys have shown that\nconsumers  are  willing  to  pay  the  tariffs  proposed  if  service  delivery  is  reliable.  Although\nindividual water meters will not be installed for each apartment unit, all apartment buildings will\nbe metered at the basement, and charging by volume will still benefit all households living in\napartments. The utility charges of poor households in apartment buildings are currently being\nsubsidized. By involving the community in project implementation, local mahalla committees and\nconsumer committees will ensure that poor households will continue to be subsidized under the\nnew tariff structure.\n102. The anticipated unification of the official currency exchange rate with the commercial or\nmarket rate could result in a currency devaluation during the life of the Project. Devaluation may\nincrease counterpart contributions to local project costs in money terms by fueling inflation,\nalthough the equivalent dollar cost will remain unchanged or be reduced. The inflationary impact\nis mitigated by the use of high, local cost escalation factors for local price contingencies.\nDevaluation  of  the  currency  to  a  level  below  that  anticipated  will  cause  the  debt  service\nobligations of the vodokanals to increase since vodokanals are required to repay the loan at the\nprevailing commercial exchange rate under the subsidiary loan agreement. If the currency\ndepreciates to the extent that the vodokanals cannot cover the cost of debt service and O&M\nthrough  user  charges,  the  Government  has  agreed  that  the  vodokanals  will  prioritize\nexpenditure on O&M. In these circumstances, the Government will review the vodokanals\u2019 debt\nservice obligations.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA.  Specific Assurances\n103. The  Government  has  given  the  following  assurances,  in  addition  to  the  standard\nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents:\n(i)  Counterpart Funding. The Government will ensure and cause oblast and city\nadministrations  of  Djizzak,  Gulistan,  and  Karshi  and  the  UCSA  General\nDirectorate on Interregional Water Trunk Mains to ensure that during each year\nof project implementation adequate budgetary allocations of required counterpart\nfunds will be made, and such funds will be released by the relevant authorities on\na timely and regular basis to facilitate project implementation by preparing and\nadopting, by 31 December of each year, an operation plan for the next year.", "32\n(ii)  PMU  and  PIU  Staff.  The  Government  will  ensure  and  cause  the  local\ngovernments of the project cities to ensure that the PMU and PIUs are always\nadequately staffed with competent technical, accounting, and support staff.\n(iii)  O&M and Service Delivery.

The  Government  will  facilitate  the  setting  up,  and\nsupport the activities, of the consumer committee in each project city.\n(ix)  Accounting  Standards.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  all  necessary\nmeasures are taken within two years from project commencement to allow the\nPMU,  PIUs,  and  in  particular,  the  city  vodokanals,  to  apply  international\naccounting  standards  (of  the  International  Accounting  Committee  or  other\ninternationally accepted standards) for the purpose of this Project.", "33\n(x)  Audit.  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  project  account  and  financial\nstatements of the three project vodokanals are audited by an independent auditor\nin accordance with sound audit standards acceptable to ADB, and ensure that\nthe  auditor  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  competitive\nselection procedures acceptable to ADB.\n(xi)  Project Performance and Monitoring System. The PMU and the three PIUs\nwill put in place project performance and management monitoring and evaluation\nindicators, including baseline data, within six months of loan effectiveness and\nwill submit annual project performance monitoring system reports to ADB.\nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness\n104. The Government agrees to execute a subsidiary loan agreement with UCSA under\nterms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.\nC.  Conditions for Disbursement\n105. The conditions for disbursement are\n(i)  No withdrawal will be made from loan proceeds related to civil works and supply\ncontracts  in  the  project  cities  for  which  a  subloan  agreement  has  not  been\nexecuted between UCSA and the respective vodokanal.\n(ii)  The  Government  will  have  issued  a  decree  specifying  (a)  roles  and\nresponsibilities of the Ministry of Finance, UCSA, local governments, and other\nrelevant agencies; (b) flow of funds between the parties; and (c) cost recovery\narrangements.\n(iii)  Except for mobilization payments for project consultants, loan disbursement will\nnot  take  place  until  the  Government  has  fielded  the  project  management\nconsultants provided under the Project.\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION\n106. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of\nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan of $36,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary\ncapital resources to the Republic of Uzbekistan for the Urban Water Supply Project with a term\nof  25  years,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  and  with  interest  to  be  determined  in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s pool-based variable lending rate system for US dollar loans, and such\nother terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft\nLoan and Project Agreements presented to the Board.\nTADAO CHINO\nPresident\n3 September 2001", "34\nAPPENDIXES\nNumber Title Page Cited on\n(page, para.)\n1 Project Framework 35 2, 3\n2 Institutional Structure 38 6, 17\n3 External Assistance to the Sector 40 7, 22\n4 Description of Water Supply Component 41 14, 43\n5 Detailed Cost Estimates and Financing Plan 42 16, 48\n6 Project Implementation Structure 45 18, 52\n7 Flow of Funds 47 18, 54\n8 Implementation Schedule 48 19, 57\n9 Proposed Procurement Packages and Procurement 49 19, 58\nModes\n10 Terms of Reference for Consulting Services for Project 50 20, 59\nManagement Support\n11 Summary Initial Environmental Examination 53 24, 76\n12 Social Analysis 56 25, 78\n13 Advisory Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for 60 26, 82\nUrban Water Supply\n14 Economic Analysis 63 27, 87\n15 Financial Analysis 66 28, 91\n16 Affordability Analysis 71 28, 94\n17 Poverty Impact Assessment 73 30, 98\nSUPPLEMENTARY APPENDIXES\n(available on request)\nA Description of Water Supply Component\nB Detailed Economic Analysis\nC Detailed Financial Analysis\nD Local Government Finance\nE Project Performance Monitoring System", "35 Appendix 1, page 1\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Project Targets and Monitoring Risks and\nMeasurable Indicators Mechanism Assumptions\nGoals\n(cid:1)  Improve quality of life (cid:1)  Sustain access to safe (cid:1)  Conduct (cid:1)  Public sector\nand health conditions and adequate water surveys at agencies provide\nin three urban supply for 484,000 midterm and effective support.\ncommunities. people, of which 45 at project\npercent are classified completion.\nas poor.\n(cid:1)  Reduce the incidence\nof waterborne diseases:\ntyphoid (from 90\npercent), diarrhea (70\npercent), hepatitis A (55\npercent).\nPurpose/Objectives\n(cid:1)  Provide safe, (cid:1)  484,000 people will (cid:1)  Surveys at (cid:1)  Infrastructure is\nadequate, and easily have safe and midterm and properly managed,\naccessible  water sustainable water project operated, and\nsupply to three urban supply by 2007. completion maintained.\ncommunities.

Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency\n1.  Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA) is the former Ministry of Communal\nServices. It was established under President Decree No. 2791 (19 December 2000), and its\norganization and functions were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers under Resolution No. 493\n(21  December  2000).  The  reorganization  is  part  of  the  Government\u2019s  reform  and\ndecentralization policy on communal services. UCSA reports to the Cabinet of Ministers, but is\nnow a self-financing institution funded by income from the enterprises and organizations that\nmake up UCSA. The central Government is expected to provide some form of financial support\nduring the early years of transition. UCSA is responsible for coordinating the reform of the\ncommunal services system, developing normative-legal acts, and implementing controls on the\nenforcement  of  current  legislation  and  established  technical  requirements.  The  department\nresponsible for water in the ministry was reorganized into a general directorate responsible for\noperation and development of interregional trunk water mains only. All other responsibilities for\nthe delivery of drinking water were devolved to the oblast (province) and city levels. The\ntechnical design institutes for communal services and the center for developing norms and\nguidelines and technical training remain subordinated to UCSA to provide technical advice and\nservices to the utility agencies at the local levels.\n2.  UCSA has considerable experience in dealing with rehabilitation and upgrading of urban\ninfrastructure facilities and management of infrastructure projects under its former capacity as\nthe  Ministry  of  Communal  Services.  UCSA  has  43  professional  and  technical  staff  with\nextensive experience in the operation and maintenance of communal infrastructure assets and\ncoordination of infrastructure projects. The capacity of UCSA to manage Asian Development\nBank  projects  has  been  strengthened  through  implementation  of  the  project  preparation\ntechnical  assistance  for  the  proposed  Project  and  will  be  further  strengthened  under  the\nProject\u2019s capacity building activities. In support of the Project, UCSA has assigned four full-time\nstaff to the project management unit (PMU). These include one director, one deputy director,\nand two senior engineers, all of whom have between 10 to 20 years professional experience in\nwater supply projects. The PMU office will be located at UCSA\u2019s headquarters in Tashkent.\nB.  Territorial Communal Exploitation Agency and City Vodokanals\n3.  The  territorial  communal  exploitation  agency  (TCEA)  in  each  oblast  has  overall\nresponsibility for providing communal services, including drinking water, central heating, and\nsewerage in their oblast. The TCEA reports to its oblast government, but maintains a working\nrelationship with UCSA in reforming the communal services system. The TCEA is responsible\nfor large capital development and infrastructure programs in the oblast and is in charge of the\noblast vodokanals, which manage the city vodokanals.\n4.  The city vodokanals are responsible for providing drinking water and sanitation services\nwithin the city, and for system operation and maintenance. The vodokanals work closely with\nthe city government, which owns these public infrastructure assets. The vodokanals are self-\nfinancing institutions and do not receive operational subsidies from the Government. Most\nvodokanals are suffering from financial constraints due to poor tariff collection rates. As a result\nthey do not have adequate funds for necessary capital investment to enable the infrastructure\nsystems to function properly.

Water supply in the three cities of Djizzak, Gulistan, and Karshi is in a relatively similar\nstate. It is characterized by (i) limited availability of raw water resources; (ii) high per capita\nconsumption because of lack of conservation awareness and responsibility; (iii) underfunded\nassets leading to antiquated equipment, inefficiencies, and failures; (iv) diversity of corporate\ninvolvement; and (v) inability to manage assets in an effective manner due to limited financial\nresources and restricted technological expertise. The Project seeks to address these problems\nand to create a modern and efficient operation from which the whole population can expect an\nacceptable standard of service at an affordable cost.\n \n2. The proposed components are summarized in Table A4.  Existing borehole performance\nyields  will  be  tested.  Some  boreholes  will  be  abandoned  and  those  remaining  will  be\nrefurbished, including the provision of new pumps, riser pipes, switchgear, and controls. One\nnew borehole will be constructed. Total water production will be metered. The reservoir capacity\nwill  be  increased,  where  necessary,  to  provide  an  adequate1  reserve  of  water  to  satisfy\nvariations in demand, temporary failures, and sufficient retention time to enable particulate\nmatter that might otherwise have an adverse effect on meter performance to settle out. All\nreservoirs will be equipped with new, automatic chlorinators. Primary pumping into the supply\nand distribution network is necessary in each city and these pumping stations will be fully\nreequipped. Alternative electricity supplies to all boreholes and primary pumping stations will\nprotect against single-source failures.\n \nT  able A4: Summary of Project Components\nItems Djizzak Gulistan Karshi\nBoreholes \u2013 rehabilitation 55 20 60\nBoreholes \u2013 new 1 0 0\nReservoir storage 6 x 500 m3 10 000 m3 10 000 m3\nChlorination 12 units 1 unit 4 units\nMajor pumping stations \u2013 reequip 6 pumps 4 pumps 10 pumps\nMinor pumping stations \u2013 reequip and new 23 pumps 0 26 pumps\nReplacement of fragile/defective mains 37 km 45 km 60 km\nConstruction of new mains \u2013 strengthen supply and 91 km 36 km 40 km\nimproved distribution coverage\nSupply, district, consumer metering (approx.) 13,100 15,550 28,800\nAsset management facilities Equipment and Equipment and Equipment and\nplant plant plant\nLaboratory testing \u2013 equipment and reagents Yes Yes Yes\nOther:  Replacement of sections of transmission main 0 0 9 km\n \n3.

Introduction\n1. The Project\u2019s physical components for water supply in the three project cities of Djizzak,\nGulistan, and Karshi were examined against the criteria specified in the Asian Development\nBank\u2019s Environmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. The checklist of water\nproject actions known to affect environmental resources and values was applied.\n2. The project implementation units (PIUs) to be set up under the Project and the utility\nagencies concerned will also conduct environmental screening of the water supply projects\naccording to the laws of Uzbekistan. The law requires that an environmental impact statement\nbe  prepared  starting  at  the  time  of  the  selection  of  the  construction  site,  and  with  tasks\ncontinuing through the preparation of feasibility studies, implementation, and construction.\nB. Description of the Project\n3. The Project\u2019s physical components comprise works as identified generally in Table A11.\nTable A11: Physical Components\nWater Supply Component Djizzak Gulistan Karshi\nRehabilitation of borehole 55 20 60\nNew borehole 1 0 0\nStorage reservoir 6 x 500 m3 10,000 m3 10,000 m3\nChlorine dosing facility 12 units 1 unit 4 units\nMajor pumping station (1 in each town) 6 pumps 4 pumps 10 pumps\nLocal booster pumping 6 stations 0 8 stations\nReplace fragile/defective mains 37 km 45 km 60 km\nConstruction of new mains 91 km 36 km 40 km\nSupply, district, consumer metering 13,100 15,550 28,800\nAsset management facilities Equipment and plant Equipment and plant Equipment and plant\nLaboratory testing Full package Full package Full package\nReplace transmission main 0 0 9 km\nkm = kilometer, m3 = cubic meters.\nC. Description of the Environment\n4. Physical. Most of the project works will occur within the urban environment where low\ndensity and generous street rights-of-way prevail. The climate is hot and dry in summer, causing\na significant increase in water use.\n5. The quality of abstracted raw water is generally suitable for potable use according to\nnational standards and, apart from chlorination, no other treatment is provided. The water is\ntransmitted in large, buried pipelines, stored in closed reservoirs, then chlorinated and pumped\ninto the below-ground distribution network.\n6. Ecological. Years of intensive agricultural production, primarily cotton growing, has\ncaused serious, long-term ecological problems in Uzbekistan. Rivers are badly polluted by cattle\nhusbandry, industrial effluent, and sewage, in addition to receiving surface runoff and leachate\nloaded with agrochemicals. Urban areas also suffer local soil contamination from industrial\nwastes and effluents, and from solid waste disposal in landfills. However, the three project cities\nall rely on aquifers that are primarily recharged by runoff from mountain snowmelt. They are,\ntherefore, relatively unaffected by the ecological concerns mentioned above.", "54 Appendix 11, page 2\n7. Socioeconomic. Deficient urban communal services have social and health impacts.\nThe negative impacts of poor communal services on public health are amplified by higher urban\npopulation density. In particular, irregular water supplies through fragile underground networks\nwhere polluted groundwater exists (from lack of adequate sanitation) increases the risks of\nwaterborne diseases.\nD. Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1.  Project Location\n8. The proposed work predominantly comprises rehabilitation of existing infrastructure and\na modest increase in water storage facilities. With the exception of wellfield rehabilitation and\nrepairs to transmission mains, all work will be confined to the urban areas. None of the water\nsupply components will adversely affect natural or cultural resources nor sensitive ecological\nzones, and no resettlement of residents is required by any of the activities.\n2. Design Aspects\n9. The overall effect of the proposed works will be to improve the quality and efficiency of\nwater service. The use of metering and consumption-based billing will encourage conservation\nby users. Water quality will improve as a result of improved filtering and chlorination, and by\nreplacing  leaky  distribution  networks  to  reduce  infiltration  by  groundwater.  Improvement  of\ntesting laboratories in the vodokanals (water supply agencies) will improve their capacity to\nmonitor the quality of raw water and water supplied to the distribution network.\n10. The potential health hazards from spilled chlorine in the city of Djizzak, where existing\nboreholes and chlorination facilities are located within built-up urban areas, will be minimized by\nnot stockpiling chlorine at these sites. Chlorine-dosing facilities will be constructed to comply\nwith state planning and construction standards.\n3. Construction\n11. The construction of pipe networks is likely to cause minor, temporary impacts such as\ntraffic  disruption,  and  potential  for  erosion  (silt  runoff)  at  excavation  and  trenching  sites\nHowever, these are routine problems that can be mitigated by construction management.\n4. Operations Stage\n12. Improved efficiency in all phases of service provision, combined with tariff reforms, will\nimprove the generation of revenues to sustain the service at the improved levels. Where new\nequipment is installed, training on operation and maintenance will be provided.\n5. Environmental Monitoring and Institutional Requirements\n13. Each of the utility agencies concerned will be required to assess environmental impacts\nof the project physical work, and to prepare the statements of environmental impacts and\nconsequences required by Uzbekistan law. The works proposed are similar to other works\nconducted by the respective utility agencies, and their existing institutional capacity is adequate\nto prepare the required environmental impact assessments. No capacity building measures are\nneeded in this regard.", "55 Appendix 11, page 3\n14. Once the components are operational, the utility agencies will need to monitor water\nquality according to existing laws and regulations. The water agencies already routinely monitor\nwater  quality,  and  are  subject  to  quarterly  inspection  or  monitoring  by  the  Sanitary-\nEpidemeological Station, under the Ministry of Health. The water agencies have the equivalent\nof a department for safety techniques and worker protection, charged with monitoring and\nmitigating  hazardous  working  conditions.  The  designated  safety  officer  will  be  included  in\ntraining provided to operators of equipment under the Project.\n6. Findings and Recommendations\n15. None of the project physical components will cause significant environmental impacts\nbased on the screening of possible environmental consequences using ADB checklists. The\nwater supply project components will reduce per capita water consumption (and loss), and will\nreduce energy requirements by improving efficiency of equipment and distribution networks.\n16. The PIUs should each make one staff member responsible for (i) assuring that tender\nand  contract  documents  contain  binding  provisions  to  prevent  and  mitigate  adverse\nenvironmental  impacts,  (ii)  assuring  that  the  implementing  utility  agencies  comply  with\nGovernment environmental impact regulations and standards, and (iii) monitor and report on\nimpacts and compliance with the adopted environmental protection measures.\nE. Conclusion\n17. The Project will have no significant adverse environmental impact, but will result in\nnumerous  environmental  improvements.  An  environmental  impact  assessment  is  not\nconsidered necessary.", "56 Appendix 12, page 1\nSOCIAL ANALYSIS\nA.  Introduction\n1.  Social research in the three project cities focused on the community perception of the\ncurrent standards of drinking water and other communal services, its impact on their lives, and\nhow residents coped with the deficiencies. Special attention was given to gathering information\non the Project\u2019s target beneficiaries, i.e., women and low-income households, as well as on\neducation and medical services and small businesses, and on assessing the Project\u2019s impact on\nthese beneficiaries. The research comprised (i) a random statistical household sample survey\ncarried out in February 2001, covering 1,500 households (500 per city); (ii) separate focus group\ndiscussions with low income men and women focusing on poverty issues; (iii) women\u2019s focus\ngroups on gender issues relating to water supply; (iv) a random selection of home visits in\nvarious mahallas (local self-management civil committees) in each city; (v) consultation with\nteachers groups in all cities; (vi) visits to local doctors in their clinics and the city epidemiology\ndepartments; (vii) interviews with local nongovernment organizations (NGOs), including those\ninvolved with youth and the disabled; and (viii) in-depth interviews with a selection of water\nsensitive small and medium sized enterprises.\nB.  Background\n2.  Uzbekistan\u2019s population was estimated at 24.6 million in 2000 and is forecast to grow to\n28 million by 2010. Official projections show that the urban population will increase by 1 million\nover the next 10 years to reach 10.2 million. The national population structure is relatively young\nwith around 41 percent of persons under 15 years of age and 4 percent above 60 (1988\nfigures). Population growth is currently outstripping growth in employment and will provide a\nchallenge to the Government in future years. The incidence and extent of poverty has worsened\nsince independence. Per capita income fell by approximately 24 percent between 1991 and\n1996 and has not recovered in real terms. Inflation has affected families living on fixed incomes,\nparticularly in the public sector where wages have not kept pace with inflation. Low-income\nfamilies rely on strong family support and on the mahalla benefits system. This system of\nneighborhood committees provides the basis for the administration of the Government\u2019s social\nwelfare support system. Mahalla officials screen families according to officially defined criteria\nand  administer  welfare  payments  to  those  who  are  most  in  need.  On  health,  Uzbekistan\ninherited an outdated health system from Soviet times, and although significant progress has\nbeen made since 1991, health facilities need to be improved to meet the pressing needs of a\ngrowing population. On education, Uzbekistan had 97 percent literacy and an average of 10\nyears schooling for all adults over 25 at the time of independence. However, the decrease in\nbudget  allocation  for  education  has  meant,  among  others,  reduced  funding  for  school\nmaintenance.\n3.  These difficulties of the transition period have had a negative impact on the quality and\nscope of coverage of basic urban infrastructure services, especially in small towns, which have\nmore budgetary constraints. Frequent problems are experienced with drinking water supplies to\ndwellings, schools, clinics, and small businesses. Public dissatisfaction with poorly maintained\nwater supplies in the project cities, coupled with low income and affordability problems, means\nthat collection of payments is difficult.", "57 Appendix 12, page 2\nC.  Profile of Beneficiaries\n4.  Based on the results of the social survey undertaken in February 2001, the average\nhousehold income per month in the three cities ranges from SUM7,400 to SUM26,000 per\nmonth. Household sizes in the project cities vary significantly between extended families in\nhovles (traditional single-story private houses) and nuclear families in apartments. For example,\nin Djizzak households in hovles averaged 5.42 persons and in apartments 3.35 persons. In\ngeneral, poor households comprise single elderly, elderly couples, unemployed, low-paid young\ncouples with children, and large extended families with few wage earners.\n5.  When poverty is measured in terms of quality of life, such as vulnerability to water cuts\nand other service deficiencies, then the majority of the urban population is exposed to varying\ndegrees. Only 29 percent of respondents expressed no water supply problems. While poor\naccess to services is not linked to housing type or to area, households living in hovles have\ndirect control over getting plumbing maintenance and may also benefit from sharing facilities\nand  household  bills.  Households  living  in  apartments  above  the  second  floor  level  are\ncomparatively more vulnerable to water service and other problems. In general, the absorptive\ncapacities of apartment dwellers are less than that of those living in hovles. Households headed\nby women are more likely to live in apartments; extended family structures in hovles more often\nhave adult males who can generate income either on a formal or casual basis.\n6.  The key issue is whether households can afford to pay for alternatives to mitigate the\neffects of service deficiencies. Higher income families can minimize the amount of time spent on\ncollecting water by purchasing water pumps and storage tanks or paying for trucked delivery of\nwater. Low-income families, in particular women, cope by carrying buckets of water several\ntimes per day to their homes and often have to climb stairs when elevators are not functioning\nor working. In households headed by low-income elderly, sick, or disabled people, vulnerability\nis highest as they cannot carry heavy buckets and need to carry small amounts more frequently.\n7.  Small businesses such as restaurants, hair salons, and other personal services reported\nthat  their  turnover  is  highly  sensitive  to  water  supply  problems.  Schools  are  extremely\nvulnerable to service deficiencies. Lack of water severely affects hygiene leading to waterborne\ndiseases  and  hepatitis  outbreaks.  Many  low-income  households  cannot  afford  medical\ntreatment. Clinics are unable to maintain standards of hygiene due to deficient supply of safe\nwater.\nD.  Role of Women\n8.  Women are affected most by water supply and other service problems, since they are\nprimarily responsible for cooking, cleaning, child care, and taking care of the sick and elderly.\nThe high incidence of deficiencies in the drinking water systems in the project cities mean that\nwomen have to develop coping mechanisms to fulfil their traditional roles. Women in low-income\nfamilies are particularly vulnerable to service deficiencies as they have less money to purchase\nalternatives such as bottled water. The majority of teachers in the three project cities are\nwomen, who reported that schools are particularly affected by water supply deficiencies. Water\noften has to be collected and stored during lesson times so that at meal times drinking water\nsupplies and general hygiene can be maintained.", "58 Appendix 12, page 3\nE.  Water Sources and Availability\n9.  Water pressure is the most common problem where water cannot reach the taps in\nhouses and apartments. Households above the second floor in apartments and also hovles on\nhigh ground are most severely affected. Other problems include daily scheduled water cuts and\nfrequent unscheduled water cuts, often for two to three days. In these conditions, households\nand small businesses have difficulty maintaining hygienic practices. Recent medical research\ncarried out by the Ministry of Health demonstrated the link between the incidence of typhoid and\nlow pressure in water pipes (and consequent reflux), water losses through taps and leaking\npipes. All these conditions exist in the three project cities.\n10.  Many households living in apartments (62 percent in Djizzak, 47 percent in Gulistan, and\n23 percent in Karshi) said that they do not receive water from existing taps or standpipes inside\ntheir homes. A smaller proportion of households living in hovles (31 percent in Karshi, 18\npercent Gulistan, and 11 percent in Djizzak) also indicated they do not receive water from taps\nor standpipes within their homes or gardens. Household members (mainly women) have to find\nother sources such as standpipes in the street, from residents living at lower levels in apartment\nblocks and from residents living in low-level hovles. All these sources are also subject to\npressure problems and therefore not constantly available. In some cases local factories with\ntheir own boreholes and pumps sell water to households. In Karshi where some of the outlying\nmahallas have no water pipes, water is sometimes collected directly from boreholes or supplied\nby water tankers to those who can afford it.\nF.  Community Structures and Social Support System\n11.  The project cities are divided into neighborhood communities administered by mahalla\ncommittees and headed by an aksakal  (chief elder). The mahalla system is a traditional Islamic\ncommunity-based organization, which has been further developed by the Government and is\nnow organized into a hierarchy of committees at the oblast (region) and national levels. One of\nthe key responsibilities of the mahalla committees is to administer the social welfare system\nwhereby low-income families can receive financial support (from which tariffs may be paid). The\nsystem tends to favor large families and elderly living alone and not all applicants from smaller\nhouseholds are able to obtain assistance. During focus group discussions some respondents\nsaid that inflation had reduced the value of their subsidies.\n12.  Social organization and group formation is higher among hovle dwellers as they are\nmore likely to be Uzbeks and involved in mahalla activities. A small number of nongovernment\norganization activities are associated with the mahallas. Residents in apartment blocks have a\nvariety of ethnicity and comparatively less control over routine repairs to pipes. Some apartment\nblocks  have  formed  housing  partnerships  to  improve  their  conditions.  These  housing\npartnerships, which have the right to decide on building repair matters, have the potential to be\nused as a basis for social awareness projects. The city governments also have women\u2019s\ncommittees who are responsible for women\u2019s development and welfare issues in the cities. The\nlevel of activity of these committees varies.\nG.  Perceived Need for Services\n13.  Dissatisfaction with communal services, in particular water supply, is widespread. The\nfocus  groups  were  unanimous  in  responding  that  the  services  were  not  value  for  money.\nApartment dwellers are particularly vulnerable in that most of them are not in control of getting", "59 Appendix 12, page 4\ntheir plumbing repairs done. The predominant reason for dissatisfaction was the irregularity of\nsupply and the second reason was the low water pressure. The problems are worse in summer.\n14.  Women are significantly disadvantaged by the water supply deficiencies in the three\nproject cities. About 70 percent of households surveyed have to carry water from sources\noutside their homes, often walking considerable distances several times per day. The mean\ndistance is about 260 meters. Moreover, 93 percent of these women do not use any form of\ntransport, although children often assist them. Of those who make trips, the average amount of\ntime spent per trip is 25 minutes with an average of 3.1 trips per day. Over one third of these\nspend between 26 and 150 minutes per day fetching water. The average time spent per day is\n43 minutes in winter and 84 minutes in summer. The vast majority of women said that they\ncould not afford to pay for water from trucks and have to make more frequent journeys. Sick and\ndisabled people and pregnant women are particularly vulnerable, particularly when they have to\nwalk up to the apartments.\nH.  Willingness to Pay\n15.  Based on the household survey results, the proportion of respondents willing to pay for\nan improved water supply is 88 percent in Djizzak, 80 percent in Gulistan, and 77 percent in\nKarshi. Willingness to pay is often not only linked to income level. Although 15.4 percent of all\nhouseholds in the survey indicate they are not willing to pay, and 51 percent of these are poor\nhouseholds, a significant proportion of other poor households of various sizes are willing to pay\nhigher amounts. About 45 percent of the households surveyed are poor and are willing to pay\nSUM500 per month for water. This indicates that a significant proportion of poor households\nconsider a safe regular supply of drinking water to be a priority. Feedback from the focus groups\nof low-income residents showed that they were unanimously in favor of having water meters\nbecause they believed that this would demonstrate their low level of consumption and therefore\nenable them to control and reduce their bills.\nI.  Social Impact\n16.  The  provision  of  safe  drinking  water  continuously  throughout  the  day  will  have  a\nsignificant positive impact on the lives of people in all income groups, and in particular women\nand the poor. Public health will be improved and indirectly income spent on medical services,\nand school days and workdays lost due to sickness related to waterborne and related diseases\nwill be reduced. The benefits will be enhanced with the implementation of health awareness\nprograms under the Project. Project benefits will be enhanced by encouraging small businesses\nto undertake plumbing repair. Children will be able to maximize the use of their school facilities\nin winter and treatment facilities in hospitals and clinics for patients will be improved.", "60 Appendix 13, page 1\nADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR\nCAPACITY BUILDING FOR URBAN WATER SUPPLY\nA.  Objective and Scope\n1.  Reforms  undertaken  by  the  Government  of  Uzbekistan  include  decentralization  of\nfunctions and some infrastructure and assets from the Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency\n(\u201cUzcommunkhizmat\u201d)  (UCSA)  to  oblasts  (provinces)  and  cities.  At  the  same  time  the\nGovernment recognizes the need to set tariffs for utilities and services at a level that will ensure\nthe services can be sustained. The Urban Water Supply Project supports the Government's\ninstitutional reform policy and includes the principles of full cost recovery and stakeholder\nparticipation in project implementation.\n2.  The main objective of the advisory technical assistance (TA) is to strengthen the sector\ninstitutions  and  train  concerned  staff  at  various  levels  of  government  in  appropriate\nmanagement systems for delivering sustainable urban infrastructure services. The TA will help\nstrengthen the capacity of the central and local governments and concerned utility agencies to\nmanage water supply facilities and services, and will improve the capacity of local training\ninstitutions and organizations to deliver the training needed for the planning, operation, and\nmaintenance  of  water  supply  systems.  The  TA  will  also  initiate  systems  for  involving  the\ncommunity  in  the  planning  of  the  services  to  be  provided  by  mobilizing  and  training\nnongovernment organizations and community-based organizations to undertake this work under\nthe Project. The services provided under the TA will encompass (i) international and domestic\nconsulting  services;  (ii)  training  of  local  government  staff,  vodokanal  staff,  and community\nleaders; and (iii) establishment of a training center where training activities can be coordinated\nand provided.\nB.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n4.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $860,000 equivalent, of which $513,500 will be foreign\nexchange cost and $346,500 the local currency cost. Of this, $600,000 equivalent will be\nfinanced by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund,\nfinanced by the Government of Japan. The ADB financing will cover the entire foreign exchange\ncost and $86,500 equivalent of local currency cost. The Government will finance the remaining\n$260,000 equivalent of local currency costs. The estimated costs and financing plan are in\nTable A13.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n5.  The Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency (UCSA), the Executing Agency of the TA,\nwill supervise the implementation of the TA to maximize the use of TA findings in promoting a\ndecentralized and community-based approach to water and heating infrastructure planning,\ndevelopment, operation, and management. The TA will be carried out over seven months,\ncommencing  in  the  second  month  of  loan  effectiveness.  The  consultants  will  be  recruited\nthrough a consulting firm in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and\nother arrangements for the engagement of domestic consultants.\nD.

Methodology and Approach\n1. The  economic  analysis  is  undertaken  in  accordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank\n(ADB) guidelines, including Framework for the Economic and Financial Appraisal of Urban\nDevelopment Sector Projects, Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, and Handbook\nfor the Economic Analysis of Water Supply Projects.\n2. The analysis describes the economic rationale and beneficiaries, sets out the without-\nproject  situation,  and  undertakes  an  analysis  of  alternatives.  The  analysis  compares  the\ncalculated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project and each component to the\neconomic opportunity cost of capital (EOCC), which is assumed to be 12 percent.1 Standard\nand project-specific sensitivity tests were undertaken to assess the robustness of the EIRR\ncalculation. The analysis uses the domestic price numeraire, as benefits are nontradable in\nnature. The analysis was done in constant 2001 prices.\nB.  Economic Rationale and Without-Project Situation\n3. Urban  infrastructure  services  in  the  project  cities  are  inadequate.  Assets  have\ndeteriorated and lack of maintenance is such that service delivery of water in the three project\ncities is severely affected. Without major investment in the near future the central water supply\nwill  continue  to  deteriorate  rapidly,  with  serious  consequences  for  economic  activity  and\nlivelihood.  Currently,  water  rationing  occurs  in  all  three  cities.  Water  shortages,  cuts  and\npressure problems mean that only about 60 percent of the population receive some water\neveryday. Without the Project, by 2007, the water supply systems in Djizzak and Karshi will\nlikely fail to supply even basic water requirements and 30 percent of the population will not have\naccess to a piped water supply. This proportion of households without access to a piped water\nsupply is expected to gradually increase, until total failure of the system, which is expected\nwithin 15 years. In Gulistan, the situation is even more severe, where without the Project, by\n2007, 100 percent of households will be without access to a piped water supply, since total\nfailure of the system is expected within 5 years. The Project is considered high priority by the\nGovernment, is timely, and is well integrated with other investment activity.\n4. The  water  supply  components  will  (i)  generate  major  efficiency  gains,  reducing\ndistribution  leakage,  water,  and  electricity  costs;  (ii)  improve  cost  recovery  through  better\ncustomer satisfaction with service delivery; (iii) reduce natural resource depletion; (iv) improve\npublic  health  by  reducing  the  incidence  of  waterborne  disease;  and  (v)  support  economic\nrecovery. Unaccounted for water will be reduced from an estimated more than 40 percent, to a\ntarget of 30 percent in 2007.\nC.  Project Description and Beneficiaries\n5. The Project will benefit about 484,000 residential water supply customers, industries,\nsmall businesses, and other organizations in the three cities. Access to a clean, safe, and\nreliable  water  supply  system  will  benefit  poor  and  nonpoor  alike  since  they  are  not\ngeographically separated and all households will have access to the improved system.\n                  \n1 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects, Manila.", "64 Appendix 14, page 2\n6. The Project\u2019s physical works mainly involve rehabilitation of existing assets and, where\nidentified as necessary, new assets including boreholes, distribution centers, pipe networks,\ntrunk mains, and metering of all residential houses and apartment blocks. The Project will also\nprovide  technical  assistance  and  capacity  building,  including  software  and  training  for\nmonitoring and control; improvements to financial management, billing, and collection systems;\nand education and awareness for customers. A consumer committee will also be set up in each\nproject city to help the water utility agency develop a customer-oriented service and improve\ncustomer satisfaction. Specific service delivery targets for water supply and water quality have\nbeen agreed with the Government.\nD.  Analysis of Alternatives\n7. An analysis of alternatives was undertaken. In Djizzak, no alternative source is available\nin the short to medium term, since the only alternative water source from the Zarafshan river\nscheme will not be available within the time frame of this Project. In Gulistan, two specific\nalternatives were considered, including total reliance on the borehole field at Dehkanabad\n(under  the  responsibility  of  Uzbekistan  Communal  Services  Agency)  and  total  reliance  on\nborehole fields under the responsibility of the city vodokanal. However, both alternatives are\nabout 10 percent more expensive and the chosen scheme is more acceptable in terms of\nimplementation. In Karshi, the unit costs of the chosen scheme were about 10 percent cheaper\nthan the next best alternative. The consideration of alternative sources was strengthened by the\nchoice of the most cost-effective rehabilitation of the distribution system. Only items that were\nconsidered essential for establishing a sustainable system were included in the project design.\nE.  Economic Costs\n8. Economic costs exclude taxes, and financial prices are converted to economic prices\nusing conversion factors. The shadow exchange rate factor (SERF) was assumed to be 2.0\nbased on the existing relationship between the commercial rate and the estimated SERF.2 Since\nthe SERF is a key input into the analysis, tests were undertaken to assess the sensitivity of the\nProject to changes in the SERF. The conversion factor for labor was assumed to be 0.8, since\nthere  is  excess  employment  in  communal  services  for  both  skilled  and  unskilled  staff.\nConsiderable savings are made in operational costs under the Project, due to efficiency gains,\nbut  these  savings  are  offset  by  increases  in  maintenance  expenditure.  The  incremental\neconomic costs are phased over the planning period of the Project, assumed to be 20 years.\nF.  Economic Benefits\n9. For  water  supply  components,  valued  economic  benefits  comprised  benefits  to\nresidents, businesses, and other organizations. Nonincremental benefits were valued using the\nresource cost savings approach for (i) use of bottled water, (ii) time savings for water collection,\n(iii) costs to large industry, and (iv) savings in health expenditure. Incremental benefits were\nvalued using (i) willingness to pay and (ii) output of small businesses. Values for bottled water\nconsumption were based on the cost of bottled water for a minimum drinking requirement but\nonly for the highest 10 percent income group. Time savings for water collection and willingness\nto pay were based on the social survey. The estimated lost output to small businesses was\nbased on a qualitative survey and local output data. The costs to larger industries were based\non  the  costs  of  extracting  alternative  water  supplies  or  lost  output.  Health  benefits  were\n                  \n2 The SERF was calculated based on the weighted average of the three exchange rates existing in Uzbekistan: the\nofficial rate, the commercial rate, and the market rate; and the estimated volume of transactions at each rate.", "65 Appendix 14, page 3\ncalculated  based  on  the  avoided  treatment  costs,  using  international  agency  research  in\nUzbekistan  on  the  impact  of  water  supply  improvements  on  the  incidence  of  five  leading\nwaterborne diseases and the cost of medical supplies from local pharmacies.\nG.  Results\n10. In each of the three cities, the EIRR exceeded the EOCC, which is assumed to be 12\npercent. Sensitivity tests were undertaken to consider the impact of economic risks. Standard\nsensitivity tests were taken at 20 percent, higher than the standard rate of 10 percent, to reflect\nthe higher level of risk associated with this Project. Switching values and sensitivity indicators\nwere  also  calculated.  Under  the  standard  sensitivity  tests,  even  under  the  most  adverse\nscenarios, the project components were found to be economically viable.\n11. Three additional project-specific sensitivity tests were undertaken. The first sensitivity\ntest increased the value of the SERF to reflect the difference between the current market\nexchange rate and the official rate. In all the cities, the EIRR exceeded the EOCC. A switching\nvalue was also calculated for the SERF to test the robustness of the assumption. The results\nshowed that the SERF would have to exceed four (or increase by 100 percent) for the EIRR to\nfall below the EOCC. The second sensitivity test assumed that the number of people using\nbottled water was halved. Again, the EIRR remained above the EOCC in each of the cities.\nFinally, an examination of the operation and maintenance costs was undertaken. Since there\nare  major  operational  cost  efficiencies  under  the  Project,  the  incremental  operation  and\nmaintenance costs of the Project are relatively low and thus even relatively large changes in key\noperational costs made little impact on the incremental operation and maintenance costs used\nin the analysis. A sensitivity test was undertaken assuming a 50 percent increase in operation\nand maintenance costs. In all cities the EIRR remained well above the EOCC.

Conclusion\n12. The project components are economically viable and stand up to adverse cost and\nbenefit scenarios. The calculated EIRR is expected to be lower than the true EIRR since the\neconomic implications of not undertaking the Project are severe.", "66 Appendix 15, page 1\nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS\nA.

Djizzak,  Gulistan,  and  Karshi  vodokanals  (city  water  supply  agencies)  are  the\nimplementing agencies for the water supply component. In line with recent government policies,\nwhich have decentralized responsibility for water supply, city vodokanals are responsible for\nwater supply and sanitation in their respective cities. Government policy has also promoted\nmarket principles in the provision of communal services, and vodokanals are currently self-\nfinancing institutions, with revenues coming from user charges rather than government subsidy.\n3.  However, the current financial situation of the vodokanals is poor. Although tariffs have\nincreased in recent years, the vodokanals suffer from low and falling collection rates, rising\nexpenditure requirements, and cash flow problems. Without the Project, the vodokanals will\ncontinue to be unable to provide an adequate water supply service, and as service delivery\ndeteriorates further, their already poor financial situation is likely to get worse. The Project will\nstop the downward spiral of poor service delivery, aging assets, and poor collection rates, and\nwill enable the vodokanals to become fully self-financing and sustainable water utilities.\n4.  The financial analysis calculates tariffs required for cost recovery, undertakes a financial\nappraisal  of  each  city  project  component,  and  provides  financial  projections  for  the  three\nvodokanals.\nB. Tariff Setting and Cost Recovery\n5.  In accordance with the recommended criteria of the Government and ADB, tariffs have\nbeen estimated based on the principle of full cost recovery from user charges, such that no\nlong-term  subsidies  are  required.  Tariff  estimates  are  based  on  the  proposed  project\nimplementation arrangements, which will introduce metered charges, by volume, for all water\nusers, including residential customers by 2007.\n6.  Tariffs cover operational expenditure, maintenance, depreciation, and interest on the\nADB loan. Since the vodokanals will be entering into subloan agreements under which they will\nbe required to repay the ADB loan at the prevailing commercial exchange rate, the burden of\nany further devaluation of the commercial exchange rate will be borne by water users. The\nrequired tariff will increase as the currency rate depreciates. The calculation of tariffs assumes\nthat  the  commercial  exchange  rate  will  depreciate  from  around  SUM690  to  $1  to  around\nSUM1,100 to $1, by the end of the construction period.1\n7.  Estimates  of  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  costs  consider  improvements  in\nefficiency,  particularly  in  the  use  of  electricity,  volume  of  water  produced,  and  specific\nmaintenance  requirements  for  the  facilities  created  under  the  Project  and  existing  assets.\nConsumption is based on estimated daily consumption for apartment residents, private houses,\n                                                \n1\nThe currency depreciation assumes purchasing power parity, such that the currency depreciates in line with the\ndifference between international and domestic inflation.", "67 Appendix 15, page 2\ncommunal services, and budget organizations. Industrial consumption is assumed to increase to\nthe levels before independence. Unaccounted for water is assumed to reduce from the current\nrate of more than 40 percent to 30 percent. The tariff collection rate is assumed to be 65 percent\nin  the  early  years  after  project  completion,  rising  to  75  percent  by  2010,  a  considerable\nimprovement  on  the  existing  collection  rates,  which  are  between  30  and  50  percent.  The\nimprovement in collection rates is reasonable since under the Project, cost recovery will be\nassisted  through  improved  service  delivery,  efficiency  gains  in  water  production,  better\nstructuring  of  tariffs  so  as  to  be  more  affordable,  more  transparent  billing,  the  consumer\ncommittees, and the education and awareness campaign. The collection rate is an important\nconsideration, which is not included in the tariff calculations currently undertaken by the utilities.\n8.  Proposed average tariffs per cubic meter in 2007 in constant prices are SUM103 in\nDjizzak, SUM119 in Gulistan, and SUM95 in Karshi, (equivalent to about $0.14 to $0.17 at the\ncommercial exchange rate). Karshi is the largest city and gains from economies of scale when\ncompared with Gulistan, the smallest city. Since existing tariffs are not charged by volume for\nresidential  customers,  existing  and  proposed  tariffs  cannot  be  compared.  Comparisons  of\nexisting and proposed household charges are shown in the affordability analysis.\n9.  Since required tariff levels are sensitive to changes in production, losses, consumption,\ncollection rates, actual costs, and inflation among other factors, tariff reviews must take place\nregularly, and appropriate tariffs implemented, both during project construction and beyond\n2007. In particular, the implication of the vodokanals bearing the foreign exchange risk is that\ntariffs  will  need  to  increase  to  meet  loan  repayments  if  the  commercial  exchange  rate\ndepreciates further than anticipated.\nB.  Financial Appraisal\n10.  Project financial appraisal was undertaken for each city, comparing the financial internal\nrate of return (FIRR)2 with the weighted average cost of capital (WACC); and the average\nincremental cost to the average incremental revenue. Sensitivity tests were undertaken, to\nassess the impact of cost increases, revenue decreases, construction delays, and a currency\ndepreciation on the FIRR. Switching values and sensitivity indicators were also calculated. The\nappraisal is undertaken in 2001 prices.\n11.  The WACC is calculated based on the cost of borrowing from ADB and counterpart\nfunds. The cost of ADB funds are calculated at 6.7 percent and discounted at international\ninflation  of  2.4  percent.  The  local  counterpart  funds  are  assumed  to  reflect  an  equity\ncontribution. The cost of counterpart funds is assumed to be 6 percent over the rate of inflation\nin line with government rates for long-term lending. The WACC is 5.0 percent.\n12.  Project capital expenditure is included in line with the implementation schedule, including\nphysical contingencies of 10 percent for all items. Replacement costs are included for meters\nand chlorination units after 10 years, and control equipment every 5 years. O&M costs include\nonly the additional costs incurred under the Project.\n13.  Revenues are additional user charges attributed to the Project. Revenues are based on\nthe required average tariff, actual water consumption, and a collection rate of 65 percent. Tariffs\nare assumed to stay constant in real terms after 2007 but revenues increase slightly due to\nincreases in water consumed.\n                                                \n2\nThe FIRR calculation uses project capital costs and additional O&M costs associated with the Project.", "68 Appendix 15, page 3\n14.  The FIRRs are 9.5 percent in Djizzak, 9.5 percent in Gulistan, and 8.4 percent in Karshi.\nAll exceed the WACC, which is about 5.0 percent, demonstrating that at proposed tariff levels\nthe project components are financially viable (Table A15.1).\n15.  Standard  sensitivity  tests  were  undertaken  and  consideration  was  given  to  key\nassumptions in the analysis. Revenue is the most sensitive factor in the analysis, and an\nadditional  sensitivity  test  was  undertaken  for  a  20  percent  decrease  in  revenue.  The  city\ncomponents  were  found  to  be  financially  viable  under  all  the  adverse  cost  and  revenue\nscenarios. Detailed calculations and sensitivity tests on the FIRR are shown in a supplementary\nappendix.\nTable A15.1: Water Supply, Proposed Tariffs, and Summary FIRR Results\nItem Djizzak Gulistan Karshi\nAverage required tariff 103 119 95\nWACC 5.0% 5.0% 5.0%\nFIRR 9.5% 9.5% 8.4%\nCosts increase by 10 percent 8.5% 8.4% 7.4%\nRevenues decrease by 10 percent 8.4% 8.3% 7.3%\nCosts increase and revenues decrease 7.4% 7.2% 6.2%\nby 10 percent\nRevenues decrease by 20 percent 7.2% 6.9% 6.0%\nRevenues delayed by 1 year 8.3% 8.2% 7.3%\nCurrency depreciation of 30 percent 8.3% 8.2% 7.2%\nCosts increase \u2013 switching value 55% 48% 37%\nRevenue decrease \u2013 switching value 35% 32% 27%\nCurrency depreciation \u2013 switching value 138% 120% 95%\nFIRR = financial internal rate of return, WACC = weighted average cost of capital.\nSource: Staff estimates.\nC. Financial Projections\n16.  Detailed financial projections up to 2015 have been prepared for the Djizzak, Gulistan,\nand  Karshi  city  vodokanals.  Projections  for  vodakanals  cover  water  supply  and  sanitation\noperations. The projected financial statements are in current prices that include inflation in each\nyear. International inflation is assumed to be 2.4 percent per annum. Domestic inflation is\nassumed to be 20 percent for 2001, 15 percent for 2002, and 10 percent thereafter.\n17.  Under the proposed project implementation arrangements, fixed assets created under\nthe  Project  will  be  transferred  to  the  vodokanals  during  project  implementation  and  the\nvodokanals will undertake a subsidiary loan agreement with the Executing Agency to repay the\nADB loan. For the purposes of the analysis, assets are valued using the commercial exchange\nrate and are assumed to accumulate as work in progress in line with the implementation\nschedule. The currency is expected to devalue over the construction period of the Project to\naround SUM1,100 by 2007. Since currency movements after 2007 cannot be predicted, the\nexchange rate is assumed to stay constant, such that the ADB debt service in sum terms\nremains equal over the repayment period. In reality, since the loan repayment is fixed in dollars,\nif  the  exchange  rate  moves  significantly,  then  tariffs  will  need  to  be  adjusted  to  take  the\nexchange rate movement into account.", "69 Appendix 15, page 4\n18.  The opening balance is based on balance sheets provided by the vodakanals for 2000.\nFixed assets are very low since assets are old and have been almost fully depreciated. Where\nthe balance sheet provided did not balance, an appropriate adjustment was made.\n19.  Project  fixed  assets  are  depreciated  at  a  rate  of  2.5  percent  per  annum  for  pipe\nnetworks, 10 percent for meters, and 5.0 percent for other assets, on a declining balance.\nAccounts payable represent 10 percent of operating expenses. Seventy percent of additions to\naccounts payable are paid in the following year.\n20.  Long-term debt is the ADB loan from ordinary capital reserves. Since the margin for\nonlending is not decided and will be small, the ADB loan is assumed to be onlent to the\nvodokanals  at  the  same  terms,  including  an  interest  rate  of  6.7  percent  per  annum,  a\ncommitment charge of 0.75 percent, and a 1 percent front-end fee. Nonoperational revenue is\nassumed to be zero.\n21.  The value added tax is calculated at an average of 15 percent on actual income. Profit\ntax is assumed to be 18 percent in line with government requirements.\n22.  The collection rate is assumed to be 65 percent rising to 75 percent by 2010. Revenues\nnot collected are written off, thus the allowance for doubtful debts represents 35 percent of\ncurrent period debit falling to 25 percent.\n23.  Revenue for the years to 2006 is based on actual current income, increasing at a rate of\nabout 15 percent a year. Although tariffs are assumed to increase over the period, since service\ndelivery will not be improved substantially until the Project is almost completed, collection rates\nare not expected to improve until the latter years of project implementation. The increase in\nrevenue  in  2007  is  therefore  the  result  of  improvements  in  collection  rates,  rather  than\nsubstantive increases in tariffs.\n24.  Expenditures are expected to stay the same in real terms until 2007. From 2007 fixed\nand  variable  costs  for  water  are  calculated  based  on  production  volume.  Expenditure  on\nsanitation is assumed to stay the same in real terms. Detailed assumptions of unit cost rates\nand calculation of O&M costs is included in Supplementary Appendix C.\n25.  In  the  years  to  2007,  because  of  inadequate  actual  income,  the  vodokanals  are\nexpected to continue to experience cash flow problems. This scenario is thought to be realistic,\ngiven the inadequate service provision of the vodokanal and the inability to charge for a service\nif none is provided. While the situation under the Project will not suddenly improve in year 2007,\nit is prudent to assume that revenue streams will not improve until after project completion.\n26.  In Gulistan, Uzbekistan Communal Services Agency will own and operate some of the\nassets created under the Project. However, for the purposes of the financial projections and\nanalysis, assets are recorded as part of the vodokanal.\n27.  By 2007, the vodokanals run at a moderate profit and show reasonable financial ratios.\nKey financial ratios are shown in Supplementary Appendix C, Table SAC.7. The return on net\nassets in the early years is very low since the value of net assets is very high in relation to\noperations  of  the  vodokanal,  as  would  be  expected  in  a  utility  that  undertakes  significant\ninvestment in very long-term assets. When compared with net operational income, profit levels\nin the early years are around 10 to 15 percent.", "70 Appendix 15, page 5\n28.  Debt service ratios exceed 1.2. However, as discussed, if the exchange rate depreciates\nfurther than anticipated, the debt service obligations of the vodokanals will rise. Particularly\nsince revenue is dependent on collecting tariffs from residents and businesses, the actual debt\nservice requirement is critical to the financial performance and sustainability of the vodokanal.\nUnification  of  the  currency  appears  likely  in  the  early  years  of  implementation.  Since  the\nanalysis is done at the commercial exchange rate, this is taken into consideration. The analysis\nalso takes into consideration a considerable further depreciation of the commercial exchange\nrate. However, given the inability to predict the volatility of exchange rates, very large currency\nmovements cannot be assumed. If debt service requirements are much higher than anticipated,\nthen tariffs need to be adjusted accordingly. The Government has agreed that tariffs should\nadjust to take account of debt service requirements. In addition, the Government has agreed\nthat  in  the  unlikely  event  that  the  vodokanal  cannot  meet  O&M  costs  and  debt  service\nobligations, then the O&M assets will be given first priority in order to safeguard service delivery\nand sustainability of the water supply system.\n29.  Based on the data available and the assumptions set out, after project completion the\nperformance of the vodokanals is shown to be truly self financing, with income covering realistic\nand adequate maintenance and repair to keep assets in good order, provide for depreciation,\nand run at a small profit. Under these conditions, the vodokanals appear to be sustainable in the\nlong term. Summary ratios are shown in Table A15.2. Detailed analysis and financial statements\nare shown in a supplementary appendix.\nTable A15.2: Vodokanals, Key Ratios 2007\nItem Djizzak Gulistan Karshi\nDebt service ratio 1.5 1.5 1.5\nCurrent ratio 7.2 4.1 3.9\nDebt to equity ratio 1.4 1.9 2.0\nRate of return on net assets 2% 2% 2%", "71 Appendix 16, page 1\nAFFORDABILITY ANALYSIS\nA.  Introduction\n1.  An  affordability  analysis  has  been  undertaken  to  assess  whether  the  Project  is\naffordable to residential customers, based on estimated tariffs and household income data from\nthe social survey. In line with ADB practice, tariffs are considered to be affordable if they fall\nbelow 5 percent of monthly household income. Since metered charging will be introduced under\nthe Project, a tariff structure was prepared for each city using a residential tariff stepped by\nvolume and cross-subsidization of residential customers to increase affordability.\nB. Tariff Structure and Affordability\n2.  Proposed  average  tariffs  are  calculated  using  the  principle  of  full  cost  recovery.\nHowever, since affordability of tariffs is a critical issue in project towns, a flat unit charge for all\nusers  is  not  recommended.  Continued  cross-subsidization  of  residential  customers  is\npreferable. In addition, once meters are installed, charging residential customers by volume but\nstepping tariffs according to volume is both possible and recommended.1 This will encourage\ndemand management and appropriate water use, and reduce wastage. Setting a low tariff for\nlow consumption is termed a \u201clifeline\u201d tariff as it assists those with low income to have a\nsubsistence consumption of water at a subsidized and affordable price. Unfortunately in the\nproject cities the advantage of a lifeline tariff for different customers is affected by the lack of\nindividual meters for apartments, within apartment blocks. This affects up to half the residential\npopulation. However, since apartment blocks are metered and the number of families in each is\ngenerally not too large, volume tariff structuring is considered to be useful although some of the\nbenefits will not be realized.\n3.  The tariff structure includes for residential customers: a lifeline tariff set at 75 liters per\ncapita per day (lcd), a tariff for consumption between 75 lcd and 125 lcd, and a higher tariff for\nconsumption over 125 lcd. Tariffs for industrial and other users are higher than the tariffs for\nresidential users.\n4.  A detailed comparison of existing and proposed charges for a variety of residential water\nconsumption  levels  is  shown  in  Table  A16.  Charges  are  also  shown  as  a  proportion  of\nhousehold  incomes.  The  household  charge  for  average  water  consumption  satisfies  ADB\ncriteria since it accounts for a maximum of 5 percent of average household income. For those\nwith  the  lowest  incomes,  the  water  charge  is  lower  than  5  percent  of  income  if  water\nconsumption is constrained to around or just above the lifeline consumption level.\n5.  The household survey showed that about 80 percent of respondents were willing to pay\nfor water supply improvements. Of those respondents who were willing to pay, the average was\nabout SUM1,000 per household per month. Proposed household charges are below this level.\n6.  Proposed nonresidential tariffs in the same range of SUM150 to SUM190 per cubic\nmeter.  In  Djizzak  and  Karshi,  this  represents  increases  of  about  three  and  four  times\nrespectively. However, in Gulistan these levels represent a large increase compared with the\ncurrent tariff since current tariffs are very low compared with the other cities. The analysis\nshows  that  to  keep  the  residential  tariffs  below  5  percent  of  income,  then  required  tariff\nincreases remain affordable in Djizzak and Karshi but are only marginally affordable in Gulistan.\n                                                \n1\nAt this stage, a more detailed stepped tariff structure cannot be designed, because until meters are installed, no\ninformation is available on the distribution and range of residential water consumption. Once metered volumes\nbecome available this demand information should be used to assist in designing an appropriate tariff structure.", "Table A16:  Tariff Structure and Affordability\nExample \nExample  Proposed  \nExample  Example  Proposed  Water  Water \nPer Capita Daily Consumption of \nProposed     Proposed    Water Charge  Lowest  Charge % of  Lowest  Charge % of  Water \nCold Water\nExisting Charge  Existing  Water Charge Water Charge  as % of  Decile HH  Lowest  Quintile HH  Lowest  Average  Charge % \nper Capita  Charge per HH  per Capita     per HH    Existing Water Income per  Decile HH  Income per  Quintile HH HH Income  of Average \n(SUM/month) (SUM/month) (SUM/month) (SUM/month) Charge Month Income  Month Income  per Month HH Income \nA.

Uzbekistan has no agreed or reliable measure of poverty and no official poverty line. The\naverage per capita monthly income in 2000 was estimated at SUM6,480.1 Since independence\nincome distribution has worsened between income groups, sectors, and regions. The national\nGini coefficient grew from 0.26 in 1991 to 0.42 in 1998.2 In Government terms the poor are\nclassified as a vulnerable and low-income group based on the prevailing official minimum wage,\nwhich is adjusted regularly for inflation, and in January 2001 was set at SUM2,450 per month.\n2.  The Government household survey is the main source for monitoring living standards.\nBased on the poverty line definition of 75 roubles per capita per month before independence,\nthe incidence of poverty, at that time, was estimated to be 44 percent of the working population.\nIf this measure is updated for the latest household survey (1996)3 to SUM740 per capita then\nthe  incidence  of  poverty  in  1996  was  21.1percent.  More  recent  work  by  Gesellschaft  f\u00fcr\nTechnische  Zusammenarbeit,  Tacis,  and  the  World  Bank  in  Tashkent,  Ferghana,  and\nKarakalpakstan, using the minimum wage criteria, indicates that urban poverty in these areas\nwas estimated at 10, 28, and 50 percent, respectively. In the same survey, self-ranked poverty\n(i.e., not having enough money for food and medicines) in these areas ranged from 30 to 70\npercent of the population depending on the location. Using the World Bank definition of poverty\nof $1 per day, even at the official exchange rate, would put the average income in Uzbekistan at\napproximately two thirds of the $1 a day level. This indicates that the majority of the population\nis poor. In 1996 the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)4 estimated the poverty\nline based on a basket of goods for the lowest 10 percent of income groups to be SUM1,006 per\ncapita, or an equivalent of SUM6,011 in 2001 prices.\nB. Income in Project Cities\n3.  Income and expenditure data for 1999 and 2000 shows that the average annual money\nincome was SUM61,200 and expenditure was SUM53,000, an equivalent of SUM6,400 and\nSUM5,700 per month. However, the national average hides wide variations between Tashkent\nCity  and  other oblasts  (provinces)  where  income  and  expenditure  levels  are  much  lower.\nIncome and expenditure in the project cities range from 40 to 65 percent of the national\naverage.5 Of the 14 regions (including Tashkent City and the Republic of Karakalpakstan), the\noblasts where the project cities are located ranked 9, 11, and 14.\nMoney Consumer Money Consumer\nIncome Expenditure Income Expenditure\nOblast (City) (half year) (half year) (per month) (per month)\n2000 2000 2000 2000\nNational Average 38,900 34,200 6,480 5,700\nDjizzak (Djizzak) 23,000 15,600 3,830 2,600\nSyrdarya (Gulistan) 30,400 22,600 5,070 3,770\nKashkadarya (Karshi) 31,300 23,000 5,220 3,830\nSource: Staff estimates.\n                                                     \n1  Government of Uzbekistan. 2000.

Approach to Poverty Impact Analysis\n4.  Despite  the  problems  of  establishing  an  agreed  poverty  line,  absolute  poverty  was\nassessed to estimate the proportion of poor and nonpoor beneficiaries. The problems involved\nin defining a poverty line include (i) use of official statistics that are not always reliable; (ii) use of\nnarrow definitions of poverty, which tend to ignore the economic, cultural, and social situation in\nthe project area and the difficulties of measuring nonmonetary benefits; and (iii) unregistered\nincome, which may form a significant part of actual income levels. Based on this evidence and\nin the absence of an agreed Government definition of poverty, an estimated poverty line of\nSUM4,000 per capita per month based on income, expenditure, and quality of life criteria has\nbeen used to calculate the percentage of poor beneficiaries. This is slightly lower than the\naverage between the Government minimum wage and the UNDP definition of the poverty line,\nand is supported by data on quality of life from the household survey.\nD. Loan Classification\n5.  Based on a poverty line of SUM4,000 per capita per month and the social survey results,\n45 percent of project beneficiaries are poor. This includes 37 percent in Djizzak, 44 percent in\nGulistan, and 51 percent in Karshi. The loan is therefore classified as a poverty intervention\nsince the proportion of beneficiaries classified as poor is in the range of 25 to 50 percent.\nE. Poverty Impact Assessment\n6.  The assessment of poverty impact used for this Project has considered (i) the extent to\nwhich  the  project  targets  areas  where  the  poor  are  located;  (ii)  the  proportion  of  project\nbeneficiaries who are poor; (iii) the targeting of the project loan toward the poor; and (iv) the\nimpact on the quality of life of the poor.\n7.  Identification of the poor within a set of project beneficiaries is not possible for this\nProject. Poor people live in houses and apartments, and are not geographically clustered within\nthe cities. Since the poor are not geographically clustered, and the Project covers the entire\nthree cities, the loan is not targeted more to the poor than the nonpoor. All beneficiaries will\nbenefit from the improvements to the water supply services.\n8.  Using  a  poverty  line  of  SUM4,000  per  capita  per  month,  the  proportion  of  poor\nhouseholds in the three project cities is around 45 percent. About 45 percent of the Project\u2019s\nbeneficiaries will be poor. The Project will improve the water supply service to all beneficiaries\nwhether poor or not. The only difference between poor and nonpoor is that the poor are least\nlikely to be able to cope under the existing situation as they cannot afford to pay for alternatives.\nThis situation will worsen if the Project does not go ahead as infrastructure facilities continue to\ndeteriorate and the service becomes increasingly intermittent or fails completely.\n9.  The project loan from ADB provides 55 percent of the project costs. The funds will be\ntargeted at project beneficiaries, 45 percent of whom are poor. Based on this, $16.2 million of\nthe funds will be targeted to the poor and gives a category B rating for loan targeting.\n10.  Poverty impact is also measured in terms of quality of life related to a definition of an\nacceptable urban living standard including access to basic services such as water supply, all of\nwhich are included in the ADB objective of poverty reduction. For this Project it is assumed that\nthe acceptable urban living standard is assumed to be the standard of service provision that\nexisted when the water services functioned properly. The effects of deficiencies in present", "75 Appendix 17, page 3\nstandards of service delivery are also taken into account. Relative deprivation, which takes into\naccount  the  urban  lifestyle,  can  also  be  adapted  to  the  specific  quality  of  life  problems\nexperienced in transitional economies.\n11.  Quality of life measures for households appropriate for the water supply component of\nthis  Project  include  (i)  access  to  safe  drinking  water,  (ii)  access  to  washing  facilities,  (iii)\nmorbidity level due to exposure to waterborne disease, and (iv) proportion of the day spent in\nwater collection (i.e., loss of productive time).\n12.  Area targeting of low-income households is not achievable in the context of Uzbekistan.\nHowever, while middle and higher income households are able to purchase alternative services,\ne.g., large water storage containers and water pumps, lower income households are more\nvulnerable to service deficiencies as these coping mechanisms are unaffordable. This leads to\nopportunity costs, which have long-term implications and perpetuate the poverty cycle. These\nfamilies are more vulnerable to sickness and are likely to spend a larger proportion of their\nincome on medical treatment. This sickness can lead to comparatively low school attendance,\nand decreased ability to learn or to be involved in productive work.\n13.  The Project will also provide opportunities for women to use their time more productively\n(since they will not have to spend a large amount of time carrying water). Small- and medium-\nsized businesses are likely to improve productivity with continuous supply of water. The Project\nwill also create construction job opportunities for both skilled and unskilled labor during the\nimplementation stage. The Project will create about 2,100 person-months of skilled employment\nand about 5,000 person-months of unskilled employment.\nF. Conclusion\n14.  Based on the 45 percent poor beneficiaries, about $16.2 million of the loan will be\ntargeted to the poor. The quality of life of the poor will improve as lower income households are\nmore vulnerable to service deficiencies. The Project will reduce the effect of opportunity costs,\nwhich perpetuate the poverty cycle."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20010924104751", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "rsa", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R142-01RRPLTAgrant.doc", "ModDate": "D:20010928134008+08'00'"}}
