THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \n(ii)  the  administration  of  a  loan  to  be  provided  by  the  Strategic  Climate  Fund,1 and  (iii)  the \nadministration of a grant to be provided by the Strategic Climate Fund to the Kingdom of Cambodia \nfor the Provincial Roads Improvement Project.2 The report also describes proposed technical \nassistance (TA) for Supporting Strengthening and Institutional Reform for the Department of Land \nTransport of the Ministry of Public Works and Transport (MPWT), and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \n \n2.  The  project  will  (i)  improve  Cambodia\u2019s  provincial  road  network  in  four  provinces\u2014 \nKampong Chhnang, Kampong Speu, Prey Vang, and Svay Rieng; (ii) improve MPWT\u2019s road asset \nmanagement capabilities through an enhanced axle load control program; and (iii) help the MPWT \nestablish a community-based road safety program for the project provinces. The project  also \nsupports road design and planning for climate resilience and disaster management, including \nemergency  preparedness,  mitigation,  and  response.  The  feasibility  study  for  the  project  was \nprepared through an Asian Development Bank (ADB) TA to the government.3 \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The  project  will  rehabilitate  the  pavement  of  about  157  kilometers  (km)  of  roads  in \nKampong Chhnang, Kampong Speu, Prey Vang, and Svay Rieng provinces. The rehabilitation \nprogram will provide a safer, climate-resilient, and cost-effective provincial road network with all-\nyear  access  to  markets  and  other  social  services  for  provincial  centers  of  southeastern  and \nmidwestern Cambodia. A new cross-border facility (CBF) will be constructed at Prey Var, Svay \nRieng to facilitate efficient cross-border transport and trade between Cambodia and Viet Nam. The \nproject  will  support  a  sustainable  road  maintenance  regime,  community-based  road  safety \nmeasures,  an  HIV/AIDS  and  human  trafficking  prevention  program  (HHTPP),  climate-resilient \nmeasures, and efficient project management in the MPWT. \n \n4.  Roads  are  the  principal  mode  of  transportation  in  Cambodia.  The  road  network  of \napproximately  39,600  km  includes  (i)  about  2,100  km  of  national  roads  (primary  national \nhighways), (ii) about 9,500 km of provincial roads (secondary national highways), and (iii) about \n28,000 km of rural roads. The MPWT manages the national and provincial roads, and the Ministry \nof Rural Development manages the rural roads. \n \n5.  The remote rural economy is becoming increasingly dependent on an improved national \nroad network. However, the provincial road network that connects remote areas\u2014which have a \npaved road ratio of 11%\u2014is continuing to deteriorate because of the rapid growth in traffic, lack of \nmaintenance financing, and poor road maintenance standards and practices. For example, the \nNational Road (NR) 13 that links NRs 1 and 8 in a north\u2013south direction and NR 314D that links \nNR 1 with the CBF at Prey Var, Svay Rieng are both deteriorating.4 Although vital for transport \nwithin the Prey Vang and Svay Rieng provinces, and to cross-border transport and trade, these \nroads are unpaved and do not provide all-year accessibility.  \n                                                \n1  Under the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience. \n2  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial Roads Improvement Project. Manila \n(TA 7665-CAM). \n4  As noted in para. 4, provincial roads (secondary national highways) in Cambodia are labeled as national roads with a \n2- and 3-digit numbering system; the primary national highways are labeled using a single digit system. \n ", "2 \n6.  To  enhance  regional  transport  and  trade  activities  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \ncorridors, Cambodia acceded to the Greater Mekong Subregion Cross-Border Transport Agreement \nin November 2001. One of the initiatives to implement the agreement in Cambodia was the pilot \nimplementation of a CBF at Bavet through a bilateral agreement between Cambodia and Viet Nam in \n2003. On 17 March 2009, the two governments agreed to expand the quota of vehicles for cross-\nborder transport from 40 to 150. Since the current CBF at Prey Var, Svay Rieng has insufficient \ncapacity,  the  planned  CBF  will  supplement  cross-border  transport  and  trade  with  Viet  Nam  in \nsoutheastern Cambodia. The project will also benefit from the ongoing transport and trade facilitation \nregional TA5 through workshops for improving CBF operations. \n \n7.  Because  of  relatively  rapid  economic  development,  overloading  of  cargo  vehicles  has \nbecome a severe cause of road damage in Cambodia since 2005. This is a major issue for \nprovincial roads because of overloaded trucks that haul agricultural products and carry quarry \nmaterials. ADB is currently supporting an axle load control program for national roads; this project \nwill expand that support to provincial roads, enhance current weigh station facilities, and provide \nnew facilities. \n \n8.  Cambodia has one of the highest incidences of road accidents in the world with 10 fatalities \nper 10,000 vehicles in 2010. This is a 44% decrease from 2007 but still represents one of the \nhighest accident rates in Southeast Asia. Thus, road safety continues to be a major concern, \nespecially with the growth of traffic in provincial and rural areas. In line with the national programs \nfor road safety and ADB's ongoing road safety support through the MPWT, the project will assist \nthe MPWT in designing and managing a community-based road safety program for the project \nprovinces. \n \n9.  Given  the  natural  disasters  that  Cambodia  has  faced  since  2000  (particularly  frequent \nflooding during wet seasons), it is essential to address climate change. Recognizing this, the project \nwill rehabilitate, to paved condition, a provincial road section of 69.6 km in Kampong Chhnang and \nKampong Speu provinces to improve its climate resilience.6 The road section is a priority in terms of \nrural access, and flooding has been a persistent problem. The climate resilience measures include \nclimate-resilient  road  designs,  hazard  mapping,  tree  planting,  and  plans for  water  capture  and \nstorage, disaster preparedness, mitigation, and response. \n \n10.  The government's poverty reduction strategy for 2009\u20132013 (the Rectangular Strategy for \nGrowth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency, Phase II) emphasizes generating economic growth \nthrough  the  private  sector,  with  rehabilitation  and  development  of  the  country's  physical \ninfrastructure as a necessary precondition.7 The project supports this strategy, particularly as it \nenhances connectivity, balanced economic development, access to social services and cross-\nborder transport, and trade in remote areas of southeastern and midwestern Cambodia. \n \n11.  The overarching objective of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS), 2011\u201320138 for \nCambodia is poverty reduction in line with the government\u2019s socioeconomic development priorities. \nProject  design  has  incorporated  lessons  learned  in  the  areas  of  procurement,  governance, \nresettlement, policy formulation, loan covenants, and axle load control. In procurement, post-\nqualification of contractors will contribute to greater efficiency of civil works. Good governance will \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2010.

(TA 7851-REG). \n6  This road section comprises: (i) NR 150B starting from Tonle Sap River running west across NR 5 joining NR 53, (ii) \nNR 53 from Khlong Popok to Kampong Speu border, and (iii) NR 151B to Amleang. NRs 150B and 53 serve Kampong \nChhnang while NR 151B serves Kampong Speu. \n7  Samdech Akka Moha Sena Padei Techo Hun Sen, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Cambodia. 2008.

Manila. \n ", "3 \nbe promoted through rigorous project reviews, detailed due diligence, and close consultation with \nthe Ministry of Economy and Finance. For resettlement, ADB will conduct frequent reviews and due \ndiligence, affected people will be consulted at all stages to ensure timely provision of information \non the process and entitlements. This approach increases the awareness of affected people and \nreduces disagreements and disputes regarding compensation. Policy formulation and related loan \ncovenants  are  designed  to  be  realistic  and  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  executing  agency. \nRegarding axle load control, frequent reviews, detailed due diligence, and close monitoring are \nessential to support transparent, effective, and sustainable operations. ADB's operational priorities \non  climate  change  include  sustainable  transport  initiatives  and  promoting  climate  resilient \ndevelopment. The proposed project is in line with these priorities and is aligned with the climate \nchange implementation plan developed for Southeast Asia.9 Also, the project\u2019s climate resilience \nmeasures will bring significant benefits to the rural communities.  \n \n12.  The CPS includes four road sector projects in the program, all of which are consistent with \nthe sector assistance program evaluation10 recommendation to shift focus towards rehabilitating \nprovincial and rural roads, rather than national roads. ADB approved the first provincial road \nproject in 2009.11 This project, which has incorporated lessons learned from past interventions in its \ndesign, would be the second.12 ADB approved the first rural road project in 2010, which will \nimprove the rural poor\u2019s access to services. A second rural road project is programmed for 2013.13 \n \n13.  The geographic focus of ADB\u2019s rural livelihood efforts has been the Tonle Sap Basin\u2014\nhome to a large proportion of Cambodia's rural poor\u2014in the midwest. This project\u2019s geographical \nfocus is on Kampong Chhnang and Kampong Speu in the Tonle Sap Basin and Prey Vang and \nSvay Rieng in the southeast. Although outside ADB\u2019s traditional geographic focus, Prey Vang has \na poverty level of 37% and Svay Rieng has a poverty level of 36% (the national poverty level is \n35%).  The  southeastern  project  provinces  fit  well  geographically  with  the  southern  economic \ncorridor of the Greater Mekong Subregion as feeder routes. The roads and the CBF also align well \nwith the government\u2019s rice and rubber production and export strategy for this area. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The impact of the project is improved access to markets, jobs, and social services in four \nproject provinces. This impact is consistent with the sector results framework of the Cambodia \nTransport Sector Assessment, Strategy, and Roadmap.14 The outcome of the project is a safe, \nclimate-resilient, and cost-effective road network that provides all-year access in the agricultural \nareas of the project provinces. \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n15.  The project includes five outputs: \n(i)  Civil works. The project will improve civil works by (a) rehabilitating 88 km of \nroads\u2014NR 13 connecting NR 8 and NR1 between Komchay Mear, and NR 314D \nfrom Prosot to the border of Viet Nam at Prey Var, Svay Rieng; (b) constructing a \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2010.

This output includes detailed design \nand implementation supervision (DDIS) consulting services and land acquisition and \nresettlement required for the project roads and the CBF.  \n(ii)  Road asset management. The project will improve road asset management by \ncontrolling axle load at strategic locations on national and provincial roads, thereby \nexpanding and improving the MPWT\u2019s ongoing axle load control program. Recent \ninterventions by ADB to install and operate permanent weighbridges at seven key \nlocations in the country, as well as the establishment of a permanent axle overload \ncontrol  committee  in  the  MPWT,  have  reduced  overloading.  The  continued \ninterventions, through the expansion of existing weigh stations and the provision of \nnew weigh stations, will contribute to further reduction in overloading. \n(iii)  Road safety and safeguards. Road safety will be increased and social safeguards \nwill be implemented through (a) a community-based road safety awareness program \nin  line  with  the  national  program,  (b)  an  HHTPP,  and  (c)  a  sex-disaggregated \nbaseline socioeconomic survey of beneficiaries.  \n(iv)  Climate resilient roads. 15 The project will result in a more climate resilient road \nnetwork by assessing the vulnerability of the MPWT road network to climate change \nimpacts with a view to improving adaptation planning and introducing ecosystem-\nbased adaptation strategies. The output will also develop emergency management \nplanning for project roads and plan water capture and storage systems. Climate \nchange impacts will be reduced by a mixture of (a) design adjustments to civil \nworks,  (b)  hazard  mapping,  (c)  bioengineering  and  other  ecosystem-based \nmeasures,  and  (d)  infrastructure  policy  and  planning  activities.  In  addition,  a \ncommunity-based emergency management intervention will be piloted in Kampong \nChhnang province, with the participation of Red Cross to sustain the emergency \nmedical facilities. \n(v)  Strengthened internal capacity. The project will strengthen the capacity of the \nMPWT to provide efficient project management support for project construction as \nwell as maintenance and asset management. \n \n16.  The project will promote substantial positive employment and gender impacts in the rural \ncommunities.  The  Labor  and  Gender  Action  Plan  (LGAP)16 describes  the  labor  and  gender-\nmainstreaming aspects of the project outputs. \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n17.

All  civil  works  contracts  for  road  and  CBF  rehabilitation  will  follow \nInternational Competitive Bidding as the mode of procurement. As for consulting services, firms will \nbe recruited for activities related to DDIS, road asset management, climate resilience, and HHTPP. \nThe advanced recruitment of DDIS and TA consultants will be considered. The project will be \nimplemented over 5 years, from 2012 to 2017. The implementation arrangements are summarized \nin Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM. \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  April 2012\u2013March 2017 \nEstimated completion date  31 March 2017 \nLoan closing date  30 September 2017   \nProject Management     \n(i)  Oversight body  Ministry of Economy and Finance  Interministerial Resettlement \nCommittee \n(ii)  Executing agency  Ministry of Public Works and Transport \n(iii)  Key implementing agencies  Project Management Unit 3   \n(iv)  Project management unit 3  Phnom Penh  12 staff \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  4 contracts  $58.59 million \nInternational competitive bidding   1 contract  $0.80 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  1,305 person- $12.60 million \nmonths \nRetroactive financing and  Advance action for consulting services  1 contract  $8.45 million \nadvance contracting  for detailed design and implementation \nsupervision \nDisbursement  The ADB loan, SCF loan, and SCF grant   \nproceeds will be disbursed in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time) and \nthe detailed arrangement agreed upon \nbetween the government and ADB. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, SCF = strategic climate fund. \nSource: Asian Development Bank \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n20.  The Land Transport Department of the MPWT plans, regulates, and administers road traffic \nto ensure efficient and safe road transport. The department is not equipped to undertake these \ntasks effectively and needs to strengthen its human resource base and reform its organizational \nstructure  and  procedures.  An  associated  capacity  development  TA18 is  proposed  to  assist \nstrengthening the department in the first of a three-stage process. The first stage is diagnostics of \nthe department\u2019s need to restructure, develop staff capabilities, and modernize internal processes \nto increase efficiency. The diagnostic assessment will be followed by a separate TA for detailed \nplanning of interventions that address issues of road safety, traffic regulation, vehicle registration, \nlegislation,  and  long-term  planning.  These  interventions  will  be  designed  to  enable  various \ndevelopment partners to provide assistance for implementation. The early reform stage will include \nassistance to restructure the department, develop in-house staff capacities, support recruitment of \nstaff with new skills, and implement priority interventions as identified in the second stage. \n \n                                                \n18 Technical Assistance: Supporting Strengthening and Institutional Reform for the Department of Land Transport of the \nMinistry of Public Works and Transport (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "7 \n21.  The TA, to be implemented over a 12-month period, is estimated at $550,000 equivalent. It \nwill be financed by ADB\u2019s TA funding resources for $500,000 (from TA Special Funds-IV). The \ngovernment will fund $50,000 equivalent to cover office accommodation and communications, \ncounterpart staff support, and other administrative expenses. ADB will recruit an international firm \nin cooperation with national consultants using quality- and cost-based selection (80:20 ratio and \nsimplified technical proposal) to provide approximately 15 international and 20 national person-\nmonths of consulting inputs. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n \n22.  The improvement of provincial roads under the project will serve about 700,000 project \nbeneficiaries, the vast majority of whom are the rural poor. The approach used to evaluate the project \nfollows the standard practice of comparing the life-cycle costs of the road agency and road users, \nwith and without the project. The economic internal rate of return of the proposed project is 15.5%, \nand the economic internal rates of return for individual road sections are above 12%. \n \nB.  Governance \n \n23.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained and discussed with \nthe  Government  of  Cambodia  and  the  MPWT. This  policy  will  be  applied  throughout  project \nimplementation.  Apart  from  this,  a  good  governance  framework  (GGF)  was  developed  in \ncoordination with the government.19 The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nto ensure good governance are described in the PAM. The GGF will be posted on the MPWT and \nADB websites. The review missions will monitor compliance with their provisions and requirements \nclosely. The financial management assessment that was carried out confirms that the executing \nagency,  including  the  implementing  agency,  has  adequate  financial  management  capacity  to \nimplement the project. \n \nC.

The project\u2014categorized as effective gender mainstreaming\u2014will significantly benefit the \nrural  poor,  including  women  and  children,  living  in  the  project  provinces.  Local  economic \ndevelopment depends on improved connectivity, and paved provincial roads will reduce travel \ntimes, increase convenience, and make it safer for women and girls to travel farther from home. \nBetter accessibility will improve rural health and educational attainment. Girls will have a better \nchance of attending secondary school, markets will be easier to reach, and \u2015buy and sell\u2016 job \nopportunities for women will increase. Road construction and maintenance will generate jobs for \nlocal men and women, and provide much-needed cash income. The project's labor and gender \nmainstreaming  action  plan  will  ensure  that  contractors  give  priority  to  local  residents  for \nconstruction and road maintenance jobs, and ensure that men and women benefit equally, with \nequal pay for equal work. From a health perspective, rural villages will benefit from a significant \nreduction  in  dust,  which  is  linked  to respiratory  disease\u2014a  major  cause  of  child  mortality  in \nCambodia. Potentially negative social impacts of increased connectivity will be monitored and \nmitigated  through  HHTPP.  The  project  includes  a  community-based  road  safety  program  to \nincrease the safety of road users and local residents. \n \nD.  Safeguards \n \n25.  The project has been classified as category B for involuntary resettlement. The project will \n                                                \n19 Good Governance Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "8 \nrequire approximately 24.4 hectares of land within the existing right-of-way of the various roads \nand 2.5 hectares of privately owned land for the Prey Var CBF. The land that will be used in the \nroad  right-of-way  will  affect  non-land  assets  of  an  estimated  936  households.  Of  the  566 \nhouseholds  that  experience  impacts  on  structures (houses  and/or  shops),  all  will  be  partially \naffected or will otherwise be able to move back on remaining unaffected land beyond the corridor \nof impact. No households are expected to require relocation. The privately owned land to be \nacquired at the site of the CBF is farming land. A resettlement plan and a combined resettlement \nand ethnic minority development plan have been prepared in compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard \nPolicy Statement (2009) to mitigate of all involuntary resettlement impacts. \n \n26.  The project has been classified as category B for indigenous peoples. Potential project \nactivity  impacts  on  indigenous  peoples  in  the  project  areas  have  been  screened.  There  are \napproximately 3,000 ethnic Cham households in the project areas. Consultations during project \npreparation reveal their unanimous support for the project with the typical expected benefits to \ninclude improved access to services as well as livelihood opportunities. An estimated 49 ethnic \nCham and 5 ethnic Vietnamese households will be affected by land acquisition within the road \nright-of-way. Most of the resettlement impacts will be temporary and require relocation to remaining \nunaffected  land  outside  the  corridor  of  impact.  Other  negative  impacts  are  the  generalized \nincreased risks of HIV/AIDS transmission, human trafficking, and road accidents associated with \nthe construction and operation of the project. The specific interests of the indigenous peoples \naffected by involuntary resettlement as well as indigenous peoples communities in the project \nareas are addressed in the combined resettlement and ethnic minority development plan, the \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking prevention strategy, and the LGAP to ensure their equitable \nparticipation in project benefits and decision making  and that adverse impacts are effectively \nmitigated. \n \n27.  The  project  has  been  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  Results  of  the  initial \nenvironmental examination showed that only minor adverse environmental impacts are anticipated \nfor the improvement of project roads and implementation of small-scale climate change adaptation \nmeasures20 for surrounding communities. Such impacts, which are considered short-term and \ntemporary, will be experienced during construction mainly because of elevated levels of dust and \nnoise, traffic disruption, and potential occupational and community health and safety risks, but they \ncan be mitigated. None of the project roads are located near culturally protected areas. No rare, \nthreatened, or endangered species of flora and fauna have been found in or close to the project \narea. \n \n28.  Except for NR 53, none of the project roads are in close proximity to any protected areas of \necological significance. NR 53 runs alongside part of the eastern boundary of the Phnom Aural \nWildlife Sanctuary (PAWS) for approximately 6.5 km. The Provincial Department of Environment \nconfirmed that NR 53 does not intrude into the PAWS. As with the other project roads, there are no \nforested areas in the vicinity of NR 53. The PAWS\u2019 zones close to NR 53 are the community and \nsustainable zones that are predominantly agricultural areas, while its conservation and core zones, \nat the nearest points, are approximately 2 km and 5 km, respectively, from NR 53. As such, no \nadverse environmental impacts are anticipated for all project roads on ecologically protected areas. \nTo avoid or mitigate negative impacts arising from the project, an environmental management plan \ndetailing mitigation measures, monitoring activities, and implementation responsibilities has been \n                                                \n20 As part of the climate resilience of the project, the MPWT has been requested by commune officials and residents to \nfinance improvements to the following community resources and facilities: (i) water capture component through \nextension of water supply distribution pipes to houses and rehabilitation of water storage tanks; (ii) rehabilitation of \nirrigation dams, spillways, and canals; and (iii) dredging certain shallow areas of Boeung Skeat Lake in Chao Maong \ncommune to enhance irrigation water supply source. Dredged materials, if suitable, will be used to widen the existing \nunpaved local road along the lake. \n ", "9 \nprepared as part of the initial environmental examination. Public consultations involving affected \npeople and local officials were conducted during the initial environmental examination preparation \nin compliance with ADB information disclosure and consultation requirements through focus group \ndiscussions and individual interviews along all project roads. Environment was not seen as a major \nissue by those interviewed. To ensure that the project is carried out in accordance with the \nenvironmental  management  plan  requirements,  the  MPWT  will  specify  details  of  the \nimplementation of the plan in the bid and contract documents for consulting services and civil \nworks. The DDIS consultant will assist the MPWT in monitoring the environmental performance of \ncontractors. The DDIS consultant will also provide on-the-job training to the field personnel of the \nMPWT\u2019s Environment Safeguards Office to build their capacity in environmental management and \nmonitoring. \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n \n29.  Given the procurement management problems that other development partners have had \nwith the MPWT in the past, there is a need to establish risk mitigation measures. The preliminary \nassessment  during  the  project  feasibility  TA  identified  the  three  major  risks  during  project \nimplementation to be related to procurement, corruption, and due diligence. ADB will conduct \nintensive project reviews to mitigate all three risks effectively. The GGF is also expected to reduce \nprocurement  and  corruption  risks  while  close  coordination  with  the  Ministry  of  Economy  and \nFinance is expected to reduce corruption and due diligence risks. Risks and mitigating measures \nare described in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nProcurement   For  procurement,  intensive  project  reviews,  closely  coordinate  with  the  MEF  and \n  implement actions required under the GGF \nCorruption  For corruption, implement the GGF to strengthen internal controls, conduct intensive \n  project reviews and coordinate closely with the MEF \nDue diligence  For due diligence, conduct intensive project reviews and closely coordinate with the \nMEF \nGGF = good governance framework, MEF = Ministry of Economy and Finance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n \n30.  Implementation of the project will conform to ADB's mandatory policies on anticorruption, \nprocurement, consulting services, due diligence, safeguards, and disbursement as described in \ndetail in the PAM. The government and the MPWT have given the following assurances, in addition \nto the standard assurances that are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Within 1 year of the loan effectiveness, the government will approve the updates of \nthe National Comprehensive Axle Load Control Program in a form acceptable to \nADB. The program will provide systematic policy, strategy, and planning for the \nMPWT\u2019s  nation-wide  axle  control  and  complaint  handling  for  axle  load  control \nactivities. \n(ii)  Unless otherwise agreed by ADB, within 2 years of the loan effectiveness, the \ngovernment  will  have  reorganized  the  existing  National  Axle  Overload  Control \nCommittee  to  ensure  a  more  inclusive  environment  for  Cambodia's  axle  load \ncontrol, provided, however, that the Road Law will have been promulgated in a \ntimely manner. \n                                                \n21 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n(iii)  The government ensures that within 1 year of the loan effectiveness, appropriate \nprocedures for axle load control, that are acceptable to ADB, will be in place and \nthat all axle control activities within the country, including those using portable weigh \nscales, will be carried out in accordance with these procedures. Such procedures \nwill comprise (a) the existing technical procedures acceptable to ADB, (b) a good \ngovernance  system  applicable  to  axle  load  control  activities,  and  (c)  technical \nguidance of such activities by PMU3 within the MPWT. \n(iv)  Agreement among ADB, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and the MPWT will \nbe reached on the final GGF prepared during project processing. The MPWT will \nimplement this effectively during the entire project period. \n \n31.  In addition to the standard requirements of ADB's public disclosure policy, the MPWT will \npublicly  disclose  on  its  website  activities,  such  as  local  procurement  information,  in  order  to \nincrease public awareness on its good governance practices. \n \n32.  The effectiveness of the loan is conditional upon (i) the agreement reached between the \nMinistry  of  Economy  and  Finance  and  the  MPWT  regarding  arrangements  to  finance  the \noperational cost of axle load control stations, and (ii) the redefined and expanded functions of \nPMU3 to provide technical guidance and internal audits that are acceptable to ADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n33.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR33,008,000 to the Kingdom of \nCambodia for the Provincial Roads Improvement Project, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources, with an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace \nperiod and 1.5% per annum thereafter; for a term of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft loan agreement presented to the Board; \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of a loan not exceeding the equivalent of $10,000,000 to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial Roads Improvement Project to be \nprovided by the Strategic Climate Fund; and \n(iii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $7,000,000 to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia for the Provincial Roads Improvement Project to be \nprovided by the Strategic Climate Fund. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n25 November 2011 \n ", "  Appendix 1  11 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved  Volume of motorcycle and passenger car  The MPWT\u2019s annual  Increased \naccess to  traffic on project roads increases by 50%  reports baseline traffic  availability and \nmarkets, jobs,  from 2012 to 2019.  data  quality of transport \nand social      services following \nBy 2019, in Kampong Chhnang, Kampong   \nservices in four  the rehabilitation of \nSpeu, Prey Vang, and Svay Rieng provinces:   \nproject  project roads and \n \nprovinces   (i)  economic activity rate of 80% (ages15\u2013 Cambodia\u2019s demographic  the CBF. \n(Kampong  64, both sexes) increases to 83%;  and health survey   Agriculture-related \nChhnang,    and other industries \n(ii)  enrolment in primary school increases  The MOE\u2019s education \nKampong \nincrease in the \nfrom 90% to 95% in project districts of  management information \nSpeu, Prey \nproject area. \nKampong Chhnang, from 94% to 98% in  systems \nVeng, and   \nprojects districts of Svay Rieng, from  The improved CBF \nSvay Rieng) \n89% to 94% in the Thpong district of  operates efficiently \nKampong Speu, and from 91% to 96% in  in line with bilateral \nthe Kamchay Mear district of Prey Veng;  agreements. \nand   \n  Risks \n  (iii) maternal mortality rate (deaths within 1  Cambodia\u2019s \nUnexpected long-\nmonth per 100,000 live births) decreases  demographic and health \nterm new epidemic \nfrom 350 to 225 in project districts of  survey  \nhits Cambodia. \nSvay Rieng, from 500 to 375 in project \n \nThe project roads \ndistricts of Kampong Chhnang, from 179 \ndeteriorate because \nto 54 in the Thpong district of Kampong \nof insufficient funds \nSpeu, and from 305 to 180 in the \nfor road \nKamchay Mear district of Prey Veng. \nmaintenance \nprograms and low \nquality of road \nworks. \nOutcome      Assumptions \nSafe, climate- Average travel times on project roads  The MPWT\u2019s field traffic  The government \nresilient, and  decrease by 25% from 2012 to 2017  surveys  sustains its \ncost-effective      commitment to \nShare of the paved provincial road network  The MPWT\u2019s provincial \nroad network  provincial \nincreases from 11% in 2010 to 12% in 2017  and national trade \nthat provides  infrastructure \nstatistics and annual \nall-year access  development. \nreports \nin the   \nThe governments of \n   \nagricultural \nCambodia and Viet \nareas of the \nNam agree to \nproject \ndevelop Prey Var, \nprovinces \nSvay Rieng as a \nsupplementary \ngateway for Bavet. \n \nRisk \nProject roads suffer \nsevere damage \nfrom unexpectedly \nsevere natural \ndisasters. \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
