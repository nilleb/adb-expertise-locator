It is recommended that small-scale project preparatory technical \nassistance in an amount not exceeding $65,000 be approved on a grant basis \nfrom TASF to the Government of Tonga for a Tourism Development Project.  The \nPPTA as well as a possible subsequent loan project are included in the \nCountry Program. \n11.  Background and Sector Highlights \n2.  Following a request by the Government of Tonga, a Tourism Sector \nReconnaissance Mission was mounted from  14 to 27 October 1989, The Mission \nreviewed the sector situation and needs, and additionally firmed up, in \nconsultation with the Government, the present proposal for Bank technical \nassistance.l/ \n3.  Tourism has been growing steadily in Tonga for many years with the \nnumber of visitors by air increasing by 6.75 per cent per annum over the last \nfive years having reached about 17,000 in 1987.  Growth in 1988 is estimated \nat about 13 per cent over 1987 figures.  In 1987, earnings from tourists \narriving by air amounted to TS10.6 million.  The proportion of these earnings \nretained within the country was larger than it would be in countries with a \ntourism industry dominated by  large-scale western style hotels.  For the \nTongan small-scale, owner-operated hotels, the \"import leakage\" rates vary \nbetween 20 to 40 per cent.  The importance of tourism to the Tongan economy \ncan be gauged from the fact that earnings from all visitors in 1987 amounted \nto  T$14.6  million, while  total  exports  including re-exports that  year \ntotalled about T$9.6 million. \n4.  With  a  few  exceptions, most  of  the. tourist  facilities  are \ndomestically owned and managed.  A  further impetus to growth can be expected \nfrom a combination of  three factors:  (i) the  runway extension and new \nterminal at Tonga's  international airport; (ii) the expected start of the \nI/  The  technical  assistance  first  appeared  in  the  ADB  Business \nOpportunities in September 1989, \n.DB Form No. 20100 \n:evised May 1987 ", "operation of a fifty-seat airplane by Friendly Islands Airways; and (iii) the \nairport improvements made at Vava'u -- an island with considerable tourism \n-- \npotential  to allow  the new  plane to  land  there.  These measures, a \nconsequence of the hiqh priority attached to tour ism in the Sixth Development \nPlan (DP VI, 1990/91-1995/96), will greatly improve air links between Tonga \nand the outside world and among the islands of the Tonqan archipelago itself. \nAt  the  same  time, Tonga  might  become  attractive  for  large-scale  tour \noperators.  This is not a neqative aspect in itself, if the existing profile \nof largely indigenously-managed tourism operations is maintained.  In line \nwith  the hiqh priority attached  to  tourism, the Government has recently \nestablished a Tonga Tourism Advisory Board. \n5.  The existing 37 hotels/guesthouses are either qovernment or private \nowned.  However, only three hotels (Dateline, Ramanlal and Paradise) meet \ninternational standards.  In a tourism environment not dominated by group \ntours and  sea-sun-sand seekers, this need not be considered a handicap. \nIndividual, often  long-haul, tourists arriving  in  Tonga are much  more \ninterested in local culture than high standard hotels.  They usually prefer \nto  stay  in  establishments where  they  can,  in  a  friendly  and  relaxed \nenvironment, experience the local lifestyles.  In other words, small-scale \nguesthouses and owner-operated hotels at acceptable quality would be well \nsuited to the tourists who seek Tonga as a destination. \n6.  Most of the small-scale hotels and guesthouses are of low quality. \nA lack of capital is the major constraint for local entrepreneurs to improve \nor  expand  their  facilities.  A  second constraint,  for  the  peripheral \nestablishments in particular, is the absence of adequate infrastructure. \nHoteliers often have to provide for infrastructure components (notably water \nsupply and waste disposal) themselves to make their facilities reasonably \nacceptable.  Credit facilities for small tourism enterprises are provided \nmainly through the Tonga Development Bank (TDB), which is supported by Bank \ncredit lines.  Of the Third Tonga Development Bank Project (Loan No.  782- \nTON(SF)), about 30 per cent of the funds were lent to  'Services', which \nincluded transportation and tourism.  It is anticipated that funds from the \nBank's Fourth Tonga Development Bank Project will cater to the more immediate \nneeds for concessionary capital for tourism by  the private sector.  In \naddition, institutional development needs including manpower development and \ntraining, and infrastructure improvement needs would have to be addressed by \nthe public sector. \n7.  Tourism in Tonga has until now developed solely due to efforts by \nthe private sector.  Further expansion requires Government attention to avoid \npossible  negative  effects  of  tourism  (environmental damage  and  over- \ncrowding).  However, the appropriate role of tourism in development and the \neconomic significance of the sector are insufficiently known.  Potentials, \nconstraints and pitfalls too are inadequately studied.  Finally, in a small \ncountry such as Tonga, there are limits to the pace of growth of tourism. \nConsequently, a tourism masterplan is required to guide future development \nin a well-conceived and properly-phased perspective.  However, some of the \nneeds, particularly those of immediate infrastructure improvement, can be \naddressed  without  waiting  for  the  preparation  and  completion  of  the \nmasterplan.  It is to help in formulating a project to meet such needs that \nthe Government has requested the Bank to provide the proposed  technical \nassistance. ", "111.  The Proposed Technical Assistance \n8.  The proposed technical assistance is to help prepare a suitable \ninvestment pro-ject of a modest size, as well as the terms of reference for \na Tourism Masterplan Study that may he considered for financing as an ADTA. \nDurinq preliminary discussions with Government officials, three possible \ncomponents were i den t i fi ed  for the investment package: \n(i) approximately 15 km of feeder/access roads to tourism facilities, \nbeaches and sites; \n(ii)  improvement  to  approximately  5  km  of  trunk  roads, adjacent \nfootpaths and additional sidewalks in Nuku'alofa or Tongatapu and \nNeiafu on Vava'u; and \n(iii)  site  preparation  for  ultimate  leasing  to  indigenous  hotel \ndevelopers, of a 10 ha lot in Popua on Tongatapu involving land \nimprovement (including removal of the existing waste dump) with \naccess roads, electricity and water supply. \n9.  The technical  assistance  is expected  to  result  in  a  loan of \napproximately $1  million but no commitment has been made regarding Bank \nfinancing of any ensuing investments.  In case the Bank considered a loan, \nthe envisaged ADTA could be piggy-backed to the loan. \n10.  Broad  terms of  reference as agreed  are at Appendix  1.  The \ntechnical assistance will require 13 manweeks of expertise in the fields of: \n(i)  civil  engineering;  (ii)  small-scale  tourism;  and  (iii)  financial \nanalysis.  The Consultant for small-scale tourism will be designated Team \nLeader.  The Ministry of Labour, Commerce and Industry will be the executing \nagency.  The  consultants will  be  selected  on  an  individual  basis  in \naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n11.  Expected to commence in May 1990, the study under the technical \nassistance will be implemented over a two-month period.  The consultant \ndesignated as Team Leader will be briefed in the Bank and coordinate the \nfieldwork.  Inputs from all experts will be consolidated into a Draft Final \nReport which will be discussed during a tripartite meeting.  Comments and \nsuggestions from the Government and the Bank will be incorporated by the Team \nLeader in the Final Report at the Bank Headquarters, where the Team Leader \nwill also finalize the detailed terms of reference for the Tourism Masterplan \nStudy. \n12.  The technical assistance is estimated to cost $72,000 of which \n$65,000 will be in foreign exchange and $7,000 equivalent in local currency. \nA breakdown of the cost is given in Appendix 2.  It is proposed that the Bank \nprovide a technical assistance grant of $65,000 from TASF to finance the \nentire foreign exchange cost.  The Government will provide for the local \ncurrency costs -- mostly in kind -- in terms of the cost of local transport \n(except local air travel), local communications, report reproduction, support \nstaff remuneration, counterpart staff, facilities for the consultants and \nother incidental expenses. ", "Appendix 1 \nPage  i \nTERMS  OF  REFERENCE \nA.  Objectives \n1.  The objectives of the small-scale project-preparatory technical \nassistance will be to help prepare an investment package, as appropriate, for \nthe proposed Tourism Development Project, and the terms of reference for \nadvisory technical assistance for a Tourism Masterplan Study. \nB.  Scope and Work Prograa \n2.  The scope of the assignment will include: \n(i) the preparation of the investment package including all necessary \nfinancial  and  economic  analysis,  technical  aspects, sectoral \nissues, and all other aspects necessary to facilitate appraisal of \nthe loan proposal; and \n(ii)  the preparation of detailed terms of reference, taking into account \nthe tentative terms of reference proposed by the Government, for \na Tourism Masterplan Study. \n3.  The technical assistance will cover a period of about two months, \nfrom May to June 1990. \nC.  Expertise Rewired \n4.  The  technical  assistance  will  require  about  13  manweeks  of \nexpertise in the fields of: (i) civil engineering; (ii) small-scale tourism; \nand (iii) financial analysis, to be provided by consultants recruited on an \nindividual basis.  The small-scale tourism expert will be designated Team \nLeader, will be briefed in the Bank Headquarters prior to the commencement \nof the fieldwork by  the consultants, will coordinate the fieldwork, and \nprepare the terms of reference for the Tourism Master Plan Study.  The \nconsultants should have a wide experience in their respective fields of \nexpertise in developin2 countries and the Pacific in partic~~lar.T hey should \nhave a proven track record in similar assignments,  The consultants should \npreferablv be familiar with the institutional framework prevailinq in Tonga. \nD.  Terms of Reference \nThe terms of reference by expertise are as follows: \nSmall-Scale Tourism/Team Leader  (six manweeks) \n(i) take inventory of the existing tourism accommodation facilities and \nevaluate the quality of the related physical infrastructure; \n(ii) quantify physical improvements and renewal required for competitive \noperation of these establishments; \n(iii) design  training  schemes for  owner-operators  to  enhance  their \nmanagerial capacities; ", "Appendix 1 \nPage '2 \n(iv) coordinate the work of the other consultants and liaise between the \nstudy team, the Government and the Bank; \n(v)  consolidate his inputs and those of the other consultants into a \nreport to optimally facilitate appraisal of the loan; and \n(vi)  formulate the detailed terms of reference for a study to prepare \na Tourism Masterplan for Tonga. \nFinancial Analysis (four manweeks) \n(i) make cost estimates for physical improvements of the small scale \ntourism establishments and related infrastructure; \n(ii)  review the Government budgetary inputs necessary to support those \nimprovements; \n(iii) assess whether institutional arrangements and the capacity of the \nTDB are adequate to ensure that indigenous hotel operators have \nsufficient access to TDB funds and that those eligible for TDB \nloans are capable of repaying them; and \n(iv)  assess the economic viability of the investments. \nCivil Engineering (three manweeks) \n(i)  assist in making cost estimates and prepare designs, in close \nliaison with the Ministry of Works, for the physical infrastructure \nimprovements to be included in the investment package; \n(ii) draw up quality standards for small-scale tourism establishments; \n(iii)  identify  the  institutional  arrangements  required  for  quality \ncontrol of construction as well as future inspection; and \n(iv) assist in selecting a new location for the existing waste dump and \nassess the environmental impact of the transfer. \nE.  Reporting Reauirements \n5.  The Team Leader's briefing at the Bank and consequent guidance on \nthe organization of the fieldwork will eliminate the need for an Inception \nReport.  All relevant findings of individual experts, arrived at with due \nliaison with the relevant technical Government agencies and using their \nstandards and guidelines, will be consolidated into a Draft Final Report \nwhich will be submitted to the Bank and the Government four weeks after the \ncommencement of the study and will be considered in a tripartite meeting. \nIncorporating  the comments received, if any, the Team Leader will finalize \nthe Report at the Bank Headquarters together with the terms of reference for \nthe Tourism Development, Plan Study during the subsequent two weeks.
