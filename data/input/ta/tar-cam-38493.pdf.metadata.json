During discussions on the country strategy and program of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) for Cambodia in 2004, the Government indicated the need for technical assistance (TA) to \nstrengthen the capacity for program budgeting in the agriculture sector. In response to this \nrequest, ADB had further discussions on the TA with key stakeholders, the relevant government \nagencies, and external funding agencies. In September 2004, understanding was reached on the \nobjectives, scope, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  In Cambodia, agriculture accounted for about 34% of the gross domestic product in \n2002, and at least 70% of the rural population directly depend on agriculture for their livelihood. \nIt is estimated that about 90% of the country's poor live in rural areas. The Government fully \nrecognizes that sustainable agricultural growth is essential to facilitate economic growth and \nreduce rural poverty. In the Second Socioeconomic Development Plan (SEDPII: 2001\u20132005), \nthe Government highlights its pro-poor policy objectives and aims to transform agriculture into a \ndriving force to achieve these objectives by promoting market-based agricultural growth and \nincreasing production values of agricultural and agro-based commodities. The new government \nformed in July 2004 is expected to continue this policy. \n \n3.  Despite the Government's stated pro-poor policy objectives, the annual programming \nand budgeting exercises in the agriculture sector, which are highly concentrated at the central \nlevel, have not adequately reflected those objectives. The sector expenditures usually follow \nhistorical patterns and often include ad hoc initiatives, which are not systematically linked to the \nmedium-term development plans of the Government.2 The priority action program of the primary \nsector agency, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF), has focused mainly \non the traditionally high income-generating areas of forestry and fisheries, and has not been \ndirected to the local-level agricultural support services. Under the national plan, the total budget \nfor MAFF was KR43.3 billion ($11.3 million) in 2003, including the provincial budget. About 24% \nwas allocated for staff salaries. To implement any field activities, MAFF mostly depends on \nexternal funds obtained through the annual development plan process. Aside from the amounts \navailable, dispersal of funds against plans and requirements is slow and erratic. It is reported \nthat there are often significant delays in releasing funds, thus affecting the implementation of \nprograms where seasonality of agricultural activities requires a quick flow of funds to avoid loss \nof a full year in field programs. Payment of salaries is often some months in arrears. There is \nsubstantial room for improving MAFF's capacity for financial planning, monitoring and analysis, \nand for strengthening the linkage between agricultural policy planning and budgeting. \n \n4.  MAFF's 5-year work program (2001\u20132005), amounting to about $10.5 million with the \nuse of program counterpart funds generated under ADB's program loan,3 followed project-based \nbudgeting to address the urgently needed activities related to agriculture and rural development, \nincluding awareness-building and training on the 2001 Land Law, and MAFF's mass-media \nbroadcasting  program  on  agricultural  technology  and  the  agricultural  market  information \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 August 2004. \n2  World Bank and Asian Development Bank. 2003.

(for $30 million, \napproved on 20 June 1996). \n ", "2   \nprogram.  This  initiative  of  MAFF  for  medium-term  program  budgeting  has  not  been  fully \nintegrated with MAFF's annual programming and budgeting exercises. \n \n5.  MAFF's operational performance and expenditures are not adequately monitored from \ndata and information generated at the provincial and district levels. The situation constrains the \nscope for facilitating appropriate  program budgeting in agriculture and for strengthening the \nlinkage between development objectives and annual public expenditures for the sector. The \ninstitutional  capacity  of  MAFF's  Department  of  Planning,  Statistics  and  International \nCooperation (DPSIC) needs to be strengthened in this aspect. \n \n6.  ADB's  strategy  for  agriculture  is  to  support  the  Government's  policy  objective  as \nprescribed in SEDPII by improving (i) farmers\u2019 ability to raise productivity, diversify toward \nhigher-value products, and connect to markets; (ii) the market environment for private agro-\nbased  enterprise  growth;  and  (iii)  the  institutional  capacity  for  competitive  agricultural \ncommercialization.  To  successfully  implement  the  strategy,  the  Government  needs  to \nsubstantially improve public financial management (PFM) for the agriculture sector. With ADB \nassistance,4 the Government has made certain efforts to introduce multiyear budgeting or the \nmedium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) since 2001. MAFF has been designated as one of \nthe four priority ministries (health, education, agriculture, and rural development) where the \nGovernment intends to strengthen PFM and increase efficiency in the use of fiscal resources. A \nfew staff of MAFF engaged in planning and budgeting received training in 2003, but introduction \nof MTEF has been delayed for MAFF. In conjunction with the Agriculture Sector Development \nProgram  (ASDP),5  ADB  will  provide  MAFF  with  initial  support  for  budget  management \nimprovement to link annual sector expenditures and national development plans and policies, \nand to improve the delivery of pro-poor support services in the field. \n \n7.  Through assistance under the ASDP, MAFF will initiate a program-based MTEF for \nagriculture, and introduce the MTEF process primarily at the central level. However, MAFF still \nrequires capacity-building support, particularly at provincial and district levels, for strengthening \nprogram budgeting to ensure increased resources for MAFF's field activities in line with the pro-\npoor development objectives of the Government. Local-level capacity building will become \nincreasingly  important  as  provincial,  district,  and  commune  administrations  will  have  an \nincreased role in planning and budgeting for activities in the agriculture sector in line with the \nGovernment's policy for decentralization. Full understanding of the MTEF process and its \nimplications for the policy, strategy, and budget planning exercises in the agriculture sector will \nbe essential to implement effective program budgeting. The proposed support will increase \nawareness and improve institutional capacity for program budgeting particularly at the local \nlevel. It will contribute to the resolution of fiscal constraints to effective delivery of pro-poor \nsupport services in agriculture, increase transparency of the budgeting and funding mechanism \nfor the sector, and facilitate and improve decentralized planning. The TA will also contribute to \nADB's assistance strategy for good governance through PFM improvement in agriculture in \ncoordination with the Government's overall PFM reform being implemented with the assistance \nof ADB and other external funding agencies (footnote 4). \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2001.

The TA will contribute to strengthening MAFF's capacity in program budgeting in the \nagriculture sector at both central and local levels, thereby improving the delivery of pro-poor \npublic services in a sustainable manner in accordance with the national development plans and \npolicies for reducing rural poverty. The expected outputs will include (i) adequate procedural \ndocuments for improved program budgeting; (ii) improved awareness, knowledge, and skills of \nMAFF  staff  at  various  levels  in  planning  and  multiyear  program  budgeting;  and  (iii)  an \nappropriate  information  and  monitoring  system  for  public  expenditures  established  and \nimplemented in the agriculture sector to facilitate the effective delivery of pro-poor agricultural \nsupport services. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n9.  The TA will be implemented in close coordination with the Government's PFM reform \nprogram, which is currently being implemented with the assistance of ADB and other external \nfunding agencies. At TA inception, an overall approach and work plan will be agreed upon with \nthe Government based on clear understanding of the position of the new MTEF process in \nrelation  to  MAFF's  annual  programming  and  budgeting  exercises,  and  of  the  roles  and \nresponsibilities of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF), and MAFF's Department of \nAccounting and Finance and DPSIC. \n \n10.  The TA will help MAFF (i) formulate necessary implementation guidelines, manuals, and \nministerial  circulars  relating  to  the  programming  and  budgeting  exercises;  (ii)  provide \nawareness-building and training programs on program budgeting and the new MTEF process in \ncollaboration with MEF for central, provincial, and district staff involved in agriculture and rural \ndevelopment activities; and (iii) establish an appropriate information and monitoring system on \npublic  fund  flows,  annual  expenditures,  and  physical  assets  in  consultation  with  key \nstakeholders. Special efforts will be made to encourage the participation of women staff at the \nlocal level (currently about 15% of the total staff of MAFF). The outline terms of reference for \nconsulting services are in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $300,000 equivalent, comprising $169,000 in \nforeign  exchange  and  $131,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  ADB  will  provide  $250,000 \nequivalent to  finance the entire foreign exchange cost and part of the local currency cost, \namounting to $81,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Governance \nCooperation Fund to be administered by ADB. The balance of the local currency cost, amounting \nto  $50,000  equivalent,  will  be  met  by  the  Government  of  Cambodia  to  cover  office \naccommodation,  counterpart  staff  support,  facilities  for  seminars  and  meetings,  and  other \nadministrative expenses. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The Executing Agency (EA) for the TA will be MAFF. MAFF is also the EA for the ASDP \nand the related advisory TA (footnote 5) to support the implementation of the policy and \ninstitutional reforms agreed upon under the ASDP. A working group will be established at MAFF \nto (i) facilitate interdepartmental coordination, (ii) provide necessary counterpart support for the \n ", "4   \nTA, and (iii) ensure that all relevant departments are properly informed of the progress of TA \nimplementation. DPSIC will act as the secretariat for the working group. The representatives of \nMEF and the Council for Agricultural and Rural Development, which is responsible for providing \noverall policy guidance on agriculture and rural development, will be invited to the working group \ndiscussions. The consultants recruited under the TA will work closely with the members of the \nworking group.  \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 9 months from April to December 2005. The TA will \nrequire  (i)  8  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  in  the  fields  of  fiscal \nmanagement, and information and monitoring systems; and (ii) 16 person-months of domestic \nconsulting  services  in  financial  management,  information  and  monitoring  systems,  and \ncommunications  and  training.  The  consultants  should  have  adequate  experience  in  the \nagriculture sector. The international consultant for fiscal management will act as the team \nleader. An international consulting firm will be selected to provide international and domestic \nconsulting services for the TA. ADB will select and engage the consultants in accordance with \nADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for \nengaging domestic consultants. ADB's standard quality- and cost-based selection method will \nbe used, and ADB will request simplified technical proposals from the short-listed consulting \nfirms. The consultant will purchase necessary office equipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. \n \n14.  Tripartite review meetings among the Government, the consultant team, and ADB will be \norganized at least three times during the TA to review progress and outputs, and resolve any \nimplementation issues. ADB will field TA review missions in conjunction with the tripartite review \nmeetings. The consultant will prepare (i) an inception report, including a detailed work plan for \nthe TA, to be submitted within 3 weeks of the start of the TA and to be discussed at the initial \ntripartite review meeting; (ii) an interim report, which compiles the outputs and activities of the \nTA during the first phase, to be submitted within 5 months of the TA and discussed at an interim \nstakeholder workshop and the interim tripartite review meeting; (iii) a draft final report, compiling \nall the TA outputs and activities, to be submitted at least 1 month before TA completion and \ndiscussed at the final tripartite review meeting; and (iv) a final report, to be presented at the \nnational seminar upon completion of the TA. The final report will be translated into the Khmer \nlanguage as required. Under the TA, the consultant will also prepare materials for awareness-\nbuilding and training programs, and technical working papers to contribute to the formulation of \nthe guidelines for institutionalizing the new MTEF processes in the agriculture sector.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 to the Government \nof  Cambodia  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Governance  Cooperation  Fund  for \nStrengthening National Program Budgeting for the Agriculture Sector, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n
