INTRODUCTION \n1.  In 2004, the Government of Nepal (the Government) asked the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  for  technical  assistance1 (TA)  to  prepare  the  Kathmandu  Valley  Water  Distribution, \nSewerage, and Urban Development Project (the Project). The aim of the Project is to finance the \nadditional investments required to meet the growing demand for urban services in the Kathmandu \nValley,  thereby  complementing  past  and  ongoing  ADB  projects.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and \nprogram 2005\u201320092 for Nepal includes provision for such TA. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited  Nepal  from  1  to  10  November  2004  and  reached  preliminary  understanding  with  the \nGovernment on the TA\u2019s goals, purpose, scope, implementation, financing arrangements, and \nterms  of  reference.  The  TA  supports  the  Government  in  its  efforts  to  implement  its  poverty \nreduction strategy and is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities as outlined in its country strategy \nand program 2005\u20132009 given its focus on (i) promoting pro-poor and broadly based economic \ngrowth,  (ii) supporting  inclusive  social  and  human  development,  and  (iii) promoting  good \ngovernance. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The absence of a clearly defined policy for urban water supply and sanitation (WSS) and \nthe sector\u2019s low institutional capacity have hampered sustainable development of the urban WSS \nsector in the Kathmandu Valley, resulting in chronic drinking water shortages and inefficient service \ndelivery. As part of the ongoing institutional reforms under the Kathmandu Valley Water Services \nSector Development Program (KVWSSDP),3 the Kathmandu Valley operations of the Nepal Water \nSupply Corporation, the public utility company, have been split into (i) an asset-holding entity, the \nKathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Board; (ii) a service provider, the Kathmandu Valley \nWater Limited (KVWL), which has been established as a limited liability company with a majority of \npublic shareholders; and (iii) a regulatory agency, the Water Supply Tariff Fixation Commission.4 \nUnder the new institutional framework, private sector participation is introduced in the form of a \nperformance-based  management  contract  whereby  a  competitively  selected  management \ncontractor will be engaged to manage the KVWL. \n3.  Rapid growth of the urban population, coupled with the Government\u2019s inability to meet the \nincreasing demand for urban services, has led to a number of urban environmental concerns in the \nKathmandu  Valley,  and  the  burdens  associated  with  poor  environmental  conditions  are \ndisproportionately borne by the poor, especially women and children. Inadequate access to basic \nurban infrastructure and services is posing serious health risks for the urban population. In addition, \nhaphazard urban sprawl is resulting in inefficient land use and many unserviced plots. Physical \ninvestment works to be commissioned under the Melamchi Water Supply Project (MWSP)5 are \nexpected to relieve pressure on the strained urban infrastructure, but additional financial resources \nwill still be needed to meet the growing demand for urban services in the Kathmandu Valley while \nkeeping the existing urban infrastructure and services functioning. The main objectives of the \nproposed Project are to enhance basic urban infrastructure further by focusing on distribution \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 15 December 2004. \n2  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n ", "2   \nnetwork improvement (DNI) of the water supply,6 wastewater system improvement, and solid waste \nmanagement and on implementing an urban development strategy to contain urban sprawl and \npromote orderly urban expansion in the Kathmandu Valley. \n4.  Water Supply DNI. The water supply DNI works are expected to enhance efficiency in the \ndistribution  of  (i) existing  water  resources  in  the  Kathmandu  Valley  before  completion  of  the \nMelamchi Diversion Scheme, and (ii) existing water resources from Melamchi once the Melamchi \nDiversion Scheme has been commissioned. The KVWL is expected to carry out the DNI works in a \nproperly sequenced manner and on an area-by-area basis. \n5.  Implementation of the DNI works is expected to encounter difficulties, in particular, with \nrespect to traffic, environmental, and safety management during excavation, which would require \ncoordination among the KVWL, the operators of other underground utilities, the municipal public \nworks departments, and the local police.7 Furthermore, the difficulties will be compounded by the \nlack of accurate records on the alignment and depth of not only existing water supply pipes, and \nsewer and drainage pipes, but also of other underground utilities, such as telephone and electricity \ncables. \n6.  By the time the consultants under this TA will have been mobilized, the KVWL will already \nhave started the DNI works under the MWSP and the KVWSSDP. The KVWL will implement a \ndemonstration scheme in the distribution zone served by the Min Bhawan elevated reservoir, \nwhose  water  availability  is  among  the  most  secure  in  the  city,  because  it  has  a  dedicated \ntransmission main with no connecting pipelines along its length from the Manohara water treatment \nplant, all of which were recently constructed as an integral package with funding from the Japan \nInternational Cooperation Agency. The demonstration scheme is expected to provide the KVWL \nwith valuable lessons on operational procedures during excavation and on coordination among \nrelevant public entities that would subsequently be applied to other parts of the Kathmandu Valley. \n7.  Wastewater  System  Improvement.  With  the  additional  water  supply  available  from \nongoing projects, the amount of wastewater generated will increase substantially from its current \nlevel.  Without  adequate  infrastructure  to  handle  wastewater,  the  urban  population  of  the \nKathmandu Valley would be exposed to pollution of water bodies and environmental deterioration. \nExisting sewage treatment plants and sewers are being rehabilitated under the MWSP. However, \nfurther  improvement  and  expansion  of  the  wastewater  management  infrastructure,  including \nadditional sewers and a new sewage treatment plant or plants, will be required to collect and treat \nthe  increased  amount  of  wastewater  after  the  water  supply  augmentation  scheme  has  been \ncommissioned. \n8.  Given the substantial investment requirements for WSS systems in the Kathmandu Valley, \nproper planning is required, including the phasing of investment and financing plans. The KVWL is \nresponsible for such planning in the Kathmandu Valley. As the KVWL is still in an early stage of \ntaking  up  its  functions,  it  requires  assistance  from  and  extensive  interactions  with  relevant \ngovernment agencies and public entities for its first planning exercise, which will be developed into \nthe initial 5-year, rolling capital investment and assets management program (CIAMP) whose \npreparation is one of the responsibilities of the management contractor. However, having a well-\nthought-out and practical CIAMP is in the best interest of all the parties concerned. \n9.  Solid Waste Management. Municipalities in the Kathmandu Valley currently do not have \nsanitary landfill sites and mostly dispose of solid waste by dumping it into nearby rivers or open \nfields. This poor management of solid waste poses serious environmental and health risks to the \n                                                 \n6  Water supply DNI is included in the MWSP, but its scope is insufficient to meet increasing needs in the Kathmandu \nValley. Thus, the proposed project includes DNI works additional to those under the MWSP. \n7 Heavy traffic congestion, narrow streets, limited availability of detours, significant number of religious places and \nfestivals, occasional general strikes called by political parties, nighttime traffic controls imposed by the security forces, \nand frequent floods during the rainy season are some of the factors likely to hamper implementation of the DNI works. \n ", "  3\npopulation  of  the  Kathmandu  Valley.  Since  the  closure  of  the  Gokarna  landfill  site  in  1999, \nKathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) and Lalitpur Submetropolitan City have been continuously \ndumping some of their waste in the Bagmati River. Initially, waste was dumped at Teku Dobhan, \nbut now it has reached Sundarighat, triggering protests from local residents and environmentalists. \nIn an attempt to diffuse the protests, KMC and Lalitpur Submetropolitan City have been shifting \ntheir dumping sites from one place to another along the banks of the Bagmati River. In 1996, the \nGovernment endorsed a plan to develop a new 41-hectare landfill site in Okharpauwa. Even \nthough the landfill site in Okharpauwa has been in operation since June 2005, residents living \naround the landfill site and along the access road have been strongly opposed to it. In addition, \nexperts have argued that the site is technically and environmentally unsuitable and is extremely \nexpensive. The Ministry of Local Development (MOLD) has started to explore alternative sites. \n10.  A recent survey indicated that more than 80 percent of Kathmandu's solid waste originates \nfrom households. Household solid waste is highly organic, dense, and has a high moisture content. \nIts organic nature may be an advantage for composting, and a large potential market for compost \nappears to exist. Currently, however, only one composting facility is operating in Kathmandu on an \nexperimental basis. Thus, there is a need to examine the possibility of engaging the private sector \nto  operate  and  manage  a  large-scale  composting  plant  or  plants  on  a  commercial  basis  in \nKathmandu.  The  Japan  International  Cooperation  Agency  is  currently  conducting  the  \u201cClean \nKathmandu Valley Study\u201d8 to formulate an action plan to improve solid waste management service \nin the valley. The action plan is expected to include preliminary designs, cost estimates, and \nfinancing plans for the development of waste management infrastructure. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of this project preparatory TA will be to improve the urban environment and \nurban service provision for the population of the Kathmandu Valley. Its outcome will be to provide \nsupport for the Government in preparing the proposed Project to a standard suitable for ADB \nfinancing. The TA\u2019s outputs will consist of (i) a project preparation report for the ensuing loan, \nincluding the design and monitoring framework, components, implementation arrangements, cost \nestimates  and  financing  plan,  and  comprehensive  feasibility  studies  in  conformity  with  ADB \nrequirements; (ii) an implementation manual for smooth and efficient execution of the DNI works, \nincluding a traffic, environmental, and safety management strategy, such as temporary detouring \narrangements during excavation, and an effective coordination mechanism with operators of other \nunderground utilities, municipal public works departments, and local police; (iii) an initial 5-year, \nrolling CIAMP for the KVWL; and (iv) an urban sector review and long-term urban development \nstrategy  based  on  an  assessment  of  growth  scenarios  in  the  Kathmandu  Valley  and  other \nemerging urban areas in Nepal. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The proposed Project will build on existing and past ADB projects, in particular, the MWSP, \nthe KVWSSDP, the Kathmandu Urban Development Project,9 and the Urban and Environment \nImprovement Project,10 by topping up physical investment in key urban sectors (water supply DNI, \nwastewater system improvement, and solid waste management). The project preparation report \nwill use the results of the urban sector review, the urban development strategy, and the CIAMP for \n                                                 \n8  The study is also called Study on the Solid Waste Management for the Kathmandu Valley. \n9  ADB. 1994.

The key activities of the TA will include (i) reviewing existing studies, documents, and \npolicies with a view to integrating them into the TA\u2019s outputs; (ii) collecting data on urban services \nin the Kathmandu Valley and other emerging urban areas in Nepal; (iii) reviewing and evaluating \ncapital  investment  and  non-capital  investment  works  in  urban  development  that  are  being \nundertaken in the Kathmandu Valley; (iv) conducting a socioeconomic survey or surveys in the \nstudy areas; (v) mapping and analyzing poverty data, slum conditions, and disadvantaged and/or \nvulnerable  groups;  (vi) undertaking  field  surveys  to  assess  the  current  conditions  of  urban \ninfrastructure and collect base data for future urban infrastructure development; (vii) summarizing \nthe existing levels of urban services, including WSS, solid waste management, drainage, urban \ntransportation,  and  slum  upgrading;  (viii) making  demand  projections  for  urban  services; \n(ix) selecting and refining the components of and investments for the ensuing Project, the CIAMP, \nand the long-term urban development strategy; (x) exploring alternatives and technical options for \nthe proposed investments; (xi) conducting economic and financial feasibility studies, environmental \nand social studies, and other documentation required by ADB guidelines for the ensuing Project; \nand (xii) assessing the capacities of the institutions, departments, and utilities involved in urban \nservice delivery with a view to recommending reforms and capacity-strengthening programs. Initial \nPoverty and Social Analysis is provided as Appendix 2. The CIAMP should be supported by a \nfinancial sustainability analysis of the KVWL to demonstrate its financial capacity to implement the \nCIAMP and maintain the additional assets. The TA consultants are also expected to organize \ncapacity-building activities, including a study tour and local training programs,11 as necessary to \nspearhead the main activities under the TA. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,160,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $400,000 \nequivalent. The Government of Denmark and the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector will \nprovide $400,000 and $160,000 equivalent, respectively, on a grant basis to be administered by \nADB. The remaining $200,000 equivalent will be contributed by the Government and will cover \noffice accommodation and transport, counterpart staff, taxes and duties, and other miscellaneous \ncosts. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are provided in Appendix 3. The Government \nhas been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Physical Planning and Works (MPPW) will be the Executing Agency and the \nKVWL will be the Implementing Agency for the TA and be responsible for overall management and \ncoordination.  The  KVWL  will  appoint  a  TA  coordinator  and  provide  office  space,  furniture, \nequipment, and technical and support counterpart staff for the TA as necessary. The Department \nof Urban Development and Building Construction (especially for components related to urban \ntransport and the long-term urban development strategy), the KMC, the four municipalities,12 and \nMOLD (especially for components related to solid waste management) will also provide inputs to \n                                                 \n11 A 2-week study tour on best-practice management of excavation work for pipe laying will be organized for about \n10 participants. A 1- week local training program will also be organized for around 30 participants. \n12 These are Bhaktapur, Kirtipur, Lalitpur, and Madhyapur-Thimi. \n ", "  5\nthe TA in terms of counterpart staff and information. In particular, MOLD staff should be involved in \nthe  development  of  the  Project  throughout  the  TA,  as  MOLD  is  implementing  solid  waste \nmanagement projects in the Kathmandu Valley. Overall guidance for TA implementation will be \nprovided by the TA Steering Committee, which will be headed by the secretary of MPPW, and will \ninclude senior officials from the Department of Urban Development and Building Construction, the \nKathmandu Valley Water Supply Management Board, MOLD, MPPW, municipalities, the National \nPlanning Commission, and the KVWL. The Steering Committee will meet at least on a quarterly \nbasis, or as frequently as required, to review TA progress and provide direction. \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 12 months from April 2007 to March 2008. A team of \ninternational and national experts will be selected and recruited through a firm using the quality- \nand-cost-based selection method to provide a total of 98 person-months of consulting services  \n(23 person-months of international consultants and 75 person-months of national consultants). The \ninternational consultants will include experts in water supply, sewerage, solid waste management, \nurban planning, and social and financial issues. The national consultants will include experts in \nwater supply engineering, sewerage engineering, solid waste management, urban planning, social, \nfinancial  and  economic  issues,  and  computer-aided  design.  ADB  will  select  and  engage  the \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from \ntime to time). Outline terms of reference for TA consultants are presented in Appendix 4. ADB\u2019s full \ntechnical proposal will be used in selecting consultants. Extensive workshops and consultations \nwill be conducted under the TA. Equipment will be procured by the consultants in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to time). The equipment will be \nhanded over to the KVWL upon completion of the TA. \n17.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in Nepal: \nPoverty reduction is the overriding goal of the Government\u2019s 10th Plan (fiscal year 2002\u2013fiscal year 2007). The 10th Plan \naims to reduce the incidence of poverty from the recent estimate of 42% to 30% by 2007 and 10% by 2017. Central to the \nnational strategy for poverty reduction is the provision of basic economic and physical infrastructure, including water supply \nand sanitation. \n \nAccess to a reliable water supply is a problem for most low-income communities in the Kathmandu Valley. Reliance on public \nsupplies from the Nepal Water Supply Corporation is minimal, and most urban poor depend on private or traditional sources \nof supply. Shallow wells are a popular source, but these are usually contaminated and are responsible for a variety of \nwaterborne diseases. The hardships involved in accessing water in the Kathmandu Valley are severe. With piped water \nsupplies limited to 2 hours every other day, most consumers, particularly the poor, rely on secondary sources. Although the \ntime the poor spend to access water for domestic use varies, approximately 1 hour is required each day. A number of \ndomestic functions are undertaken at the water point to minimize the volume of water to be carried home. Women are the \npredominant carriers of water. Residents of low-income areas carry home only about 10 liters per person of water every day. \nThis is insufficient to maintain basic hygiene and sanitation standards and is a prime cause of the high levels of morbidity \nand mortality. \n \nInternational experience shows that the provision of safe water supply and basic sanitation services in urban areas can have \na significant impact on the quality of life of the urban poor, both indirectly and directly, by stimulating economic activities that \nwould otherwise be impossible, improving hygiene conditions, decreasing the incidence of waterborne diseases, and \nempowering poor women. The ensuing Project aims to improve the urban environment and urban service provision for the \npopulation of the Kathmandu Valley by improving the water supply distribution network, the wastewater system, solid waste \nmanagement, and urban transport. The ensuing Project will contribute to the achievement of Millennium Development Goal \n7. \n \n \nB. Poverty Analysis  Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (TI-M [Millennium Development Goal]) \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nIn coordination with the social development specialists of the consulting team for the Kathmandu Valley Water Services \nSector Development Program (KVWSSDP), the technical assistance (TA) will include a poverty and social analysis to \ndetermine the socioeconomic profile of the population, the incidence of urban poverty, the nature and characteristics of \npoverty, and the perceived priorities of the poor. Secondary data from the poverty and social analysis for the KVWSSDP; \nfrom the Melamchi Water Supply Project; and from other sources, including, but not limited to, the Nepal living standards \nsurvey, will be supplemented by transect walks, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews. A socioeconomic \nsurvey will provide information on poverty, slum conditions, and disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. \n \nThe poverty and social analysis will review options to eliminate negative impacts on the poor and vulnerable through design \nchanges or to mitigate them by means of specific measures to be included in the project design and costed as part of the \ntotal project cost. The poverty analysis will also review options to extend or enhance the benefits for the poor and excluded \nthrough design changes in the scope of the policy conditions and/or the pace at which they are met. \n \nC. Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No \n \nA stakeholder analysis will be undertaken to identify key project stakeholders, their interests, and the way they affect project \nrisks and viability. The stakeholders are likely to include beneficiaries, adversely affected people, municipality officials and \nrepresentatives, ministries, the private sector, external funding agencies, nongovernment organizations, and consultants. \n \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes     No \n \nBased on the stakeholder analysis, and using participation strategies developed for the Melamchi Water Supply Project and \nthe KVWSSDP, the ensuing Project will be prepared with the participation of stakeholders. In particular, a water user \ncommittee  representing  all  beneficiaries  of  the  proposed  Project  will  be  established  and will be fully involved in project  \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \ndesign. The ensuing Project will also undertake consensus building at all levels on issues such as water supply and \nsanitation services, environmental and social impact mitigation, compensation, and employment. \n \nD. Gender and Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impact on women: \nGiven the likely scope of the ensuing Project and the dominant role of women in water collection, women are expected to be \nthe primary recipients of the benefits of urban environmental and infrastructure improvements. Women\u2019s commitment to and \nownership of the Project will influence the viability and sustainability of project outputs. The TA, consistent with the gender \nstrategy prepared for the KVWSSDP, will design specific measures to ensure that (i) women actively participate in the project \ndesign and identification of options as well as project implementation, (ii) women and men benefit equally from the Project, \nand (iii) the Project addresses differential gender needs. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
