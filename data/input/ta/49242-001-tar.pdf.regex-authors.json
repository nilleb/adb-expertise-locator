INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) aims to become a \u201cstronger, better, and faster\u201d \ninstitution in support of sustainable development in Asia and the Pacific.1 In the process, ADB is \nplacing particular emphasis on providing innovative solutions to middle-income countries facing \nchallenges,  such  as  rising  inequality,  urbanization,  aging  populations,  environmental \ndegradation, and climate change. The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 and the Knowledge \nManagement Directions and Action Plan, 2013\u20132015 recommend expanding ADB operations \nfor innovation and pilot testing by evaluating the feasibility of a solutions search model.2 The \nmidterm review recommended actions that will enable ADB to adopt new and innovative cost-\neffective technologies through new modalities; incentives; competitive crowdsourcing; product \ndevelopment partnerships, including with the private sector; and an innovation marketplace.3 In \nthe medium term, taking into account ADB\u2019s expanded financing capacity and the changing \ndevelopment landscape in Asia and the Pacific, to remain competitive and a \u201cpartner of choice\u201d \nADB will need to strengthen its focus, with dedicated operations that apply innovative solutions \nuseful for its developing member countries (DMCs). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB has introduced innovations in the institutions, operations and countries. Operational \nareas of focus include climate-proof transport, bus rapid transit systems, inclusive financial \nsolutions, a unified multipurpose identification system for government, community eCenters, and \ngreener cities.4 These innovations tend to be one-off activities undertaken in a particular project, \ncountry, or department, and ADB needs to introduce a more systemic approach to innovation. \nFew country operations business plans have attempted to replicate or scale up innovations \nmore broadly by strategically structuring and allocating ADB resources for innovation. ADB\u2019s \nsector and thematic groups have received various requests for funding from external partners to \npilot-test ideas, but these were not always pertinent to ADB investments in its DMCs. \n \n3.  In  this  context,  ADB  will  invest  its  own  technical  assistance  (TA)  resources  in  the \nproposed regional research and development TA to catalyze and establish an organization wide \nmechanism to adopt and implement innovative initiatives as quickly and flexibly as possible.5 \nThe  TA  will  also  demonstrate  the  \u201cOne  ADB\u201d  approach  to  deliver  operationally  relevant \nknowledge solutions by deepening the knowledge flow between the sector and thematic groups, \nand regional and private sector operations departments, including resident missions. \n \n4.  Addressing innovation requires leveraging ADB resources to take advantage of ADB\u2019s \nvast internal knowledge, as well as knowledge external to ADB. Drawing on the Independent \nEvaluation Department\u2019s recommendations and the experiences of development partners\u2014e.g., \nAustralia, Canada, United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and World \n                                                \n1  Remarks by President Takehiko Nakao at the Conversation with Staff: Toward a Stronger, Better and Faster ADB \non 2 June 2015 at ADB Headquarters in Manila.  \n    https://lnadbg1.adb.org/oer0012p.nsf/0/B114A09AD57B60E248257E5800301C04/$file/3Jun-President-\nConversation-with-Staff_Final-Speech.pdf \n2  ADB. 2014.

The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section \nof ADB\u2019s website on 9 September 2015.  \n ", "2   \nBank\u2014the  TA  will  support  a  robust  crowdsourcing  mechanism  to  systematically  identify, \nreplicate,  and  scale  up  pilot  initiatives  that  demonstrate  new  solutions  to  development \nchallenges in ADB DMCs.6 While crowdsourcing is not a new concept, ADB has had limited \nexperience  with  this  modality  to  date.7 Development  partners,  including  the  United  States \ngovernment, have used crowdsourcing as an effective vehicle to spur innovation and generate a \nwide range of solutions to development challenges.   \n   \nIII.  THE PROPOSED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n5.  The impact will be strengthened capacity of DMCs to solve development problems using \ninnovative solutions. The outcome will be ADB loans and grants supporting scaled-up innovative \nsolutions in DMCs increased. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.  The proposed TA has two closely linked outputs: (i) cross-sector innovative solutions to \naddress DMC development problems implemented; and (ii) crowdsourcing platform for pilot-\ntesting development solutions and business models implemented. \n \n1.  Output  1:  Cross-sector  innovative  solutions  to  address  developing \n  member country development problems implemented. \n \n7.  With  dedicated  resources  to  finance  innovation,  the  proposed  TA  will  implement \nmultiregion and cross-sector and/or thematic knowledge activities that will advance innovative \nsolutions for DMCs, introduce flexible arrangements, manage and monitor implementation of the \nsolutions, and extract lessons that can be shared across ADB. During preparation of the TA, the \nproject team held extensive consultations with sector and thematic groups and the regional and \nprivate sector operations departments, and invited them to submit proposals. The 15 initial \nproposals confirmed a strong demand for innovation on a range of topics. The project team \nevaluated each proposal based on various factors to assess whether they were innovative, \nmade  a  cross-cutting  contribution  to  a  solution  across  sector  and  thematic  areas,  could \ndemonstrate within 24\u201336 months how the innovative solution can solve DMC development \nchallenges, and were supported by a commitment from operations departments to scale up the \nsolution as a component of an ADB-supported project or stand-alone activity.8    \n \n8.  Scaling up innovative road safety operations. ADB\u2019s Sustainable Transport Initiative \nOperational Plan identified road safety as a priority for increased ADB support.9 ADB activities in \n2012\u20132015 demonstrate emerging opportunities to scale up ADB financing of road safety linked \nto its lending for roads. As a priority in the Transport Sector Group (TSG) work plan endorsed by \nthe Transport Sector Committee, the TSG worked with regional departments in selecting DMCs \nand projects for providing road safety support. This activity will conduct sector dialogue and \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2014. Corporate Evaluation Study: Role of Technical Assistance in ADB Operations. Manila. The team also \nstudied the innovation experiences of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Innovation Exchange, USAID \nDevelopment Innovation Ventures, and the World Bank Global Partnerships for Social Accountability.  \n7  The NGO and Civil Society Center called for proposals for youth-led projects in water and sanitation and launched \na crowdsourcing survey (ADB. 2015. A More Daring ADB? An Innovations Crowdsourcing Report. Manila.) \n8 The Sector Advisory Service Division senior director and the TA team leader discussed these factors with the \ntechnical advisors of the sector and thematic groups and members of the concerned department(s) for each \nproposal. Selection criteria are in Supplementary Appendix A. \n9 ADB. 2010. Sustainable Transport Initiative Operational Plan. Manila. ", "  3 \ncapacity building for DMCs, and support the preparation and implementation of road safety \ninvestments that incorporate innovative approaches with support from external experts and \nknowledge  partners  to  expand  road  safety  lending  pipelines.  It  will  also  support  quality \nassurance for initial implementation.10 This will require an indicative amount of $750,000. \n \n9.  Scaling  up  innovative  urban transport  operations. ADB has introduced innovative \nurban transport operations that provide an opportunity to expand ADB support for sustainable, low-\ncarbon transport; the TA will assist regional departments explore new business opportunities and \nscale up urban transport lending. This is a priority in the TSG work plan endorsed by the Transport \nSector Committee. With support from technical experts, including centers of excellence (COEs), the \nTA  will  assist  regional  departments  and  the  TSG  (i)  discuss  inclusion  of  innovative  urban \ntransport investments in lending pipelines with DMCs, (ii) conduct preliminary proof-of-concept \nstudies  to  support  these  discussions,  and  (iii)  provide  expert  inputs  to  support  project \npreparation and project preparatory TA teams in areas with newly introduced urban transport. \nThis  TA  will  also  provide  initial  quality  assurance  for  urban  transport  projects  under \nimplementation.11 An indicative amount of $750,000 will be required. \n \n10.  Consolidating  and  replicating  innovative  service  delivery  practices  in  districts  in \nIndonesia. ADB has assisted Indonesia\u2019s government improve its capacity, and in collaboration with \nthink tanks in Indonesia produced knowledge products surveying business licensing procedures in \nfive  main  cities,  and  surveyed  implementation  of  national  health  insurance  in  five  local \ngovernments.12 Under the TA, the Southeast Asia Department, the Governance Thematic Group, \nand RTI International will work with the central government to strengthen the capacity of one potential \nprovincial  government  and  at  least  three  districts  and/or  municipalities  to  introduce  innovative \napproaches to improving basic service delivery.13 The activity will address supply- and demand-side \nconstraints to improving service delivery and strengthening accountability mechanisms, and will \nrequire an indicative amount of $1 million. The results will be scaled up through a policy-based \nloan on service delivery in the 2018 indicative lending pipeline that is being prepared through TA. \n \n11.  Applying  graduation  programs  to  end  extreme  poverty  in  Pakistan  and  the \nPhilippines. The research and development TA will test and evaluate how ADB operations can \ncontribute  to  Sustainable  Development  Goal  1,  i.e.,  end  extreme  poverty  in  all  its  forms \neverywhere.  For  the  first  time,  ADB  will  draw  from  the  experiences  of  other  countries  to \nimplement  innovative  graduation  programs  in  two  DMCs  under  ADB-supported  large-scale \ntargeted social assistance programs. Two programs have expressed interest. These are the \nPhilippines\u2019  Department  of  Social  Welfare  and  Development  in  the  context  of  its  national \nconditional  cash  transfer  program,  the  Pantawid  Pamilyang  Pilipino  Program,  which  has \nreached  4.4  million  poor  families  identified  by  a  national  poverty  targeting  system;  and \n                                                \n10 DMCs with large road programs in the 2015\u20132017 lending pipeline include India and Sri Lanka in South Asia; \nIndonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Viet Nam in Southeast Asia; Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, \nPakistan and Uzbekistan in Central and West Asia; the People\u2019s Republic of China and Mongolia in East Asia; and \nPapua New Guinea and Timor-Leste in the Pacific. \n11 The main focus will be on DMCs expected to have large potential for scaling up (e.g., Bangladesh, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam).   \n12 In 2002, ADB assisted 46 regional governments to improve their capacity to deliver public services efficiently in line with \nestablished minimum service standards, maintain essential public facilities, promote local economic development, and \nmanage local poverty reduction programs. The local level work was complemented by a policy-based lending program \ncluster under the Local Government Finance and Governance Reform program (implemented during 2006\u20132011). \n13 The provincial government in East Java has potential for capacity strengthening; it has a reform-minded governor \nand experience working with development partners such as USAID. \n \n ", "4   \nPakistan\u2019s national social safety net program (the Benazir Income Support Program).14 This will \nbe implemented with the Central and West Asia and Southeast Asia departments, and the \nSocial Development and Gender Equity Thematic Groups at an indicative amount of $1 million. \n \n12.  Scaling up financial inclusion through digital financial services systems. The TA \nwill demonstrate how digital financial services systems (specifically a mobile telephony-based \ndigital payment system; prepaid point-of-sales systems; digital wallet used in a public service \ndelivery area such as a marketplace; and an e-commerce platform for micro, small and medium-\nsized enterprises) can effectively serve the un- and underbanked population, as well as become \na platform to sustain poverty alleviation efforts. With an estimated amount of $500,000, this will \nbe  implemented  by  the  Private  Sector  Operations  Department;  the  Public  Management, \nFinancial Sector, and Trade Division of the Central and West Asia Department; the Social \nDevelopment, Governance, and Gender Division of the Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange Department; and the Finance Sector Group. \n \n2.  Output 2. Crowdsourcing platform for pilot-testing development solutions \n  and business models implemented.  \n \n13.  The  TA  will  support  the  establishment  of  a  collaborative  platform  to  crowdsource \ninnovative development solutions and business models.15 At a relatively low cost, ADB can \naccess a wide range of solutions from within ADB and external stakeholders, most of which \nwould most likely not arise through traditional means.16 Output 2 provides the potential for ADB \nto expand (by replication and scaling up) its provision of creative solutions, by tapping into a \nbroad range of intellectual knowledge to address development challenges facing DMCs. This \nalso allows ADB to expand and build on its future pipeline. The sector and thematic groups, \nassisted by technical experts, will select pilot and demonstrative solutions that clearly address \ndevelopment challenges in DMCs that are identified in the sector and thematic group work \nprograms and/or operations department business plans. The TA envisions responding to about \nthree challenges (one per year). If successful, this number may be increased. Selection of \nproposals will be led by the relevant sector or thematic group, together with a representative \nselection panel appointed by the technical advisor, and may use established partnerships with \nCOEs, bilateral financiers, and other partners. The TA will invite ADB staff and participants from \ncountries in which ADB member governments do not object to \u201copt-in\u201d to notify (using the \nsample letter in Supplementary Appendix B), and submit solutions using the application form in \nSupplementary Appendix C.17 For each development challenge, a maximum of two or three \nsolutions will be selected and governed by a letter of agreement (in the sample form set out in \nSupplementary Appendix D).18 Sector and thematic groups will mentor, provide TA, and connect \nthe awardee with relevant external parties to develop solutions. ADB can use the knowledge \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2010.

Cost and Financing  \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $5,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  ($2,500,000 from TASF-V and  $2,500,000 from \nTASF-other sources). More proposals for innovative solutions are expected, and these will be \nreviewed and added, subject to TA implementation progress and the availability of additional \nresources, including cofinancing. Indicative cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  An ADB-wide project team led by the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment, with the participation of the sector and thematic groups and the Innovation Working \nGroup, will implement the TA for a period of 4 years from January 2016 to December 2019. The \nproject team will regularly communicate with members implementing the innovative projects, \nADB operations departments, and financing partners, if appropriate; and organize meetings and \nprepare  reports  required  for  ADB  and  partners.  The  TA  will  be  monitored  through  an \nassessment  of  the  quality  and  timely  delivery  of  outputs.  The  sector  or  thematic  group, \noperations department, or resident mission that originated the innovative proposals will lead the \nimplementation using individual or consulting firm contracts or knowledge partnerships with \nCOEs (summarized in Appendix 3).21 \n \n16.  Approximately 144 person-months of international and 137 person-months of national \nconsultants will be needed under the TA. Consulting services will be engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). \nProcurement of goods and works will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2015,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  Disbursements  will  be  carried  out  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). The outline terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. All proposals \nunder outputs will be assessed by the ADB Environment and Social Safeguards specialists to \ndetermine whether (a) there will be any involuntary resettlement, environment, or indigenous \npeoples  plan  impacts;  and  (b)  determine  the  safeguards  categorization.  Only  proposals \nclassified as category C will be eligible to receive ADB financing. Integrity due diligence shall be \ncompleted on all proposed recipients of ADB financing, including implementing partners and \nwinners of solutions. Any issues arising will be referred to the group charged with proposal \nselecting; if these cannot be resolved, the recipients will not be eligible to receive funding. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION  \n17.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot  exceeding the  equivalent  of  $5,000,000  on  a grant  basis for  Unlocking Innovation for \nDevelopment. \n                                                \n19 This may include initial proposals submitted to the project team. \n20 Action 3.8.4 in the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Action Plan (footnote 2). \n21 Strategy  and  Policy  Department  memo  on  Clarification  on  Cooperation  Arrangements  for  Development \nPartnerships (7 August 2014). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with  \nCapacity of DMCs to solve development problems using innovative solutions strengtheneda \nResults Chain  Performance Indicators  Data Sources and  Risks \nwith Targets and Baselines  Reporting \nOutcome       \nADB loans and grants  By 2019, innovative  RRPs, PCRs and  Change in the focus of \nsupporting scaled-up  solutions have influenced   development plans of  DMC government policy \ninnovative solutions in  at least $500 million of  relevant DMCs   in areas where \nDMCs increased  ADB loan and grant    innovations are targeted  \noperations   \n(Baseline: 0)  Change in DMC \n  government leadership \nthat slows adoption of \ninnovations \nOutputs  By 2019:     \n       \n1.
