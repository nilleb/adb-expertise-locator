In the PRC, initial project proposals are prepared by local governments or other project \nimplementation entities (such as project executing agencies) with the support of design institutes, \nlocal technical entities that have acquired significant capacity over time. However, capacity to \nconduct economic and financial due diligence, environment and social safeguard due diligence as \nwell as sector assessments and overall sector governance can still be improved. A new trend is \ntherefore to jointly develop multi-sector projects where cross-sector integration and oversight can \nimprove the design, effectiveness and sustainability of the ADB-financed investments. \n \n4.  Engaging consultants to work on multiple projects can improve efficiency in preparation; \nadvanced planning and scoping of sector work; and better project readiness. Moreover, it increases \nADB's  responsiveness  to  government's  priorities  that  quickly  arise  due  to  the  fast  pace  of \ndevelopment. The proposed arrangement also requires consultants, the government counterparts, \nand ADB staff to work seamlessly as one team.  \n \n5.  The proposed TA facility will provide project preparation support (planning and sector \nassessments,  due  diligence  work,  and  training  of  government  staff  to  support  their  project \npreparation activities) for four projects in the pipeline for 2021 approval. As projects will require \neconomic, financial, environment and safeguard specialists, the TA facility approach is suitable to \n(i) enhance operational efficiency in project preparation; (ii) gain synergies from working with the \nsame consultants; (iii) reduce recruitment time of consultants by allowing consultants to be retained \non a long-term basis; and (iv) strengthen coordination between ADB's preparatory activities and \ndesign institutes' work. The TA facility will result in efficient and strategic implementation of a \nconsolidated TA to support project preparation aiming at faster delivery of innovative projects, \n                     \n1  ADB. 2016.

The TA facility will finance a pool of green projects cutting across sectors to be implemented \nby local governments. The main sub-sectors include: (i) road transport (non-urban), and water transport \n(non-urban), (ii) water and sanitation, (iii) clean energy, (iv) waste management, and (v) environment. \nThe investment program is aligned with the following impact: Increased investment to promote green \ngrowth through air-, water-, and land- quality improvements as well as lower greenhouse gas \nemissions. The outcome will be an enhanced green, low-carbon and sustainable infrastructure sector \ndevelopment in the PRC. Outputs include (i) green and bankable infrastructure projects developed,  \n(ii)  increased  participation  of  financial  institutions  (FI)  in  sustainable  projects;  and  (ii)  capacity \ndevelopment of government and Fl to screen, appraise and support sustainable projects. Gender \nmainstreaming will be a critical analytical and design tool to ensure the ensuing projects are inclusive.  \n \nB.  Ensuing projects \n7.  The proposed ensuing projects under the TA facility are fully aligned with ADB's country \npartnership strategy for PRC (footnote 1) and the strategic priorities of Strategy 2030.3 The TA \nfacility is classified as complex because three of the four initial projects are rated complex. \n \nTable 1: Indicative TA Activities Implementation Period and Budget Allocation  \n  TA Budget  \nTA Activity   Title   Year  (\u2018000)  \n1   Gansu Rural Vitalization and Integrated Industry Development    2019\u20132021  450 \n2   Shanxi Low-Carbon and Beautiful Villages Development    2019\u20132021  450 \n3   Guangxi-Guilin Comprehensive Ecological Rehabilitation   2019\u20132021  450 \n4   Heilongjiang Regional Economic Cooperation   2019\u20132021  450 \n  Total    1,800 \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nGansu Rural Vitalization4 and Integrated Industry Development   \n  \n8.  Gansu  is  one  of  the  poorest  provinces  in  the  PRC  with  a  low  level  of  urbanization.  \nThe proposed project will promote rural vitalization using new models for industrial integration to \nachieve comprehensive poverty eradication in the province. The project is aligned with the Gansu \nRural Revitalization paper (2018).5 The project aims to increase rural income channels by developing \nlocal core industries and improving agricultural practices and developing tourism as a key business \nactivity.  \n \n9.  The project scope entails (i) construction of low carbon infrastructure and public service \nfacilities; (ii) industry revitalization; (iii) ecological revitalization towards improved environment;  \n(iv) cultural revitalization; and (v) talent revitalization. The project is categorized as low-risk. \n  \nShanxi Low-Carbon and Beautiful Villages Development  \n  \n10.  The proposed Shanxi Low-Carbon and Beautiful Village Development Project aims to \nsupport Shanxi Provincial government in their effort to build more balanced and inclusive growth \n                     \n3  ADB. 2018.

Based on abundant coal and other mineral \nresources, the economy of Shanxi province is mainly driven by heavy industries such as coal and \nchemical production, power generation, and metal refining accounting for 70% of provincial gross \ndomestic  product.  Carbon,  energy  and  resource  intensive  industrialization  brought  serious \nenvironmental degradation and pollution, greenhouse gases emissions, resource depletion but also \nunbalanced growth leaving Shanxi to face substantial development challenges. With the PRC \ngovernment designating Shanxi as the first national-level pilot province for comprehensive reforms \nin a resource-based economy, Shanxi province is committed to reform and set its priority focus on \nits least developed areas. \n \n11.  The proposed project aims to demonstrate low-carbon and beautiful village and county \nmodels that transform poor rural villages with limited public utility services into modern, green, \nclean, and low-carbon villages by advancing infrastructure while promoting efficient resource and \nenergy use through innovative technical and business processes. A range of low-carbon and \nbeautiful village models will be developed in various locations in south Shanxi province, which \nwould be customized to their own unique conditions, built-in systems requirements, and resource \navailabilities. The project is categorized as complex.   \n \nGuangxi\u2013Guilin Comprehensive Ecological Rehabilitation Project   \n  \n12.  Guilin is a city located in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on the Lijang River. The city \nis one of the PRC\u2019s most popular tourist destinations receiving about 5 million tourists annually.  \nThe project\u2019s impact is to alleviate poverty in impoverished counties of Guilin. The outcome is to \nimprove and rehabilitate the Lijiang River and restore ancient villages. The outputs are (i) ecological \nprotection and restoration of the Lijang River; (ii) development of ancient villages and towns;  \n(iii) construction and management of Lijiang River infrastructure and tourism service support facilities; \n(iv) construction of pedestrian and non-motorized facilities along the river; (v) protection and repair of \nancient villages in Longsheng autonomous county; and (vi) capacity strengthening.   \n \n13.  Specifically, the proposed project will improve water quality and reduce water pollution in \nthe  Lijiang  River,  reduce  air  pollution,  promote  green  transportation,  and  develop  targeted \nmeasures for poverty reduction in several impoverished counties in Guilin. It will also support the \nkey strategic priorities of mitigating climate change, promoting environmental sustainability, and \npoverty alleviation. The project is categorized as complex.  \n \nHeilongjiang Regional Economic Cooperation Project  \n  \n14.  The proposed project will enhance economic cooperation among the PRC, Mongolia and \nthe Russian Federation taking advantage of developed transport corridors and transforming them \ninto economic corridors. Smooth and efficient flow of goods and people in the corridors will be \nimproved through socially-sustainable, environmentally-friendly, and energy-efficient investments. \nThe corridors will also provide alternative seaport access to Mongolia and enhance economic \ndevelopment  to  the  country\u2019s  eastern  region,  traversed  by  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Corridor 4c.   \n \n15.  The project will be concentrated in the border cities of Heihe and Suifenhe in Heilongjiang \nProvince. The project will introduce innovative technology in the areas of logistics and supply chain \nmanagement, urban utility supply, and urban transport. It will contribute to low-carbon development \nof the economic corridors, food security, and the development of livable cities. The project will \nprovide credit to small- and medium-sized enterprises either (i) registered or physically located in ", "4 \nthe two border municipalities or (ii) involved in trade, manufacturing, agriculture or tourism business \nusing the financial intermediation loan modality. The project is categorized as complex.  \n   \n16.  The project preparation could be expanded for additional ensuing projects for preparation \nin 2020 and 2021. These projects are likely to require similar sector, financial, economic, environment, \npoverty, and social assessments, and governance, anti-corruption and integrity, legal and regulatory \ndue diligence. Framework contracts could be introduced to expedite recruitment of consultants.  \n \nC.  Outputs and Activities  \n17.
