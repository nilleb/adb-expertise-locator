INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) will promote responsible and sustainable financing in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nand support regional cooperation and integration (RCI) in the financial sector. It will (i) help \nfinancial sector regulators and institutions in the PRC adopt international best practices in \nresponsible and sustainable finance; (ii) develop innovative financial sector products in areas \nsuch as blue financing,1 disaster risk financing, longevity financing, inclusive financing, and digital \nfinancing;  and  (iii)  support  regional  learning  and  knowledge  sharing  on  responsible  and \nsustainable financing, especially through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \nincluding the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS), and the Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) program platforms.2 These efforts are expected to generate regional public \ngoods (RPGs) through the delivery of environmental and social benefits, as well as promote RCI \nin financial sector development in Asia and the Pacific.3  \n \n2.  In tandem with the operational priorities of the current PRC Country Partnership Strategy \n(CPS), 2016-2020 and ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 for supporting the PRC\u2019s high-quality growth and \ngreen development, the ADB is expanding its support for building climate change resilience, \nfostering environmental sustainability, and tackling emerging social issues (such as elderly care) \nin the country.4 To achieve the CPS and Strategy 2030\u2019s objectives, the PRC\u2019s financial sector \nneeds to become more effective and innovative in addressing environmental and climate change \nchallenges, including fostering green economic recovery and development post coronavirus \ndisease (COVID-19) pandemic. This includes the adoption of international best practices in the \nPRC, particularly in making its financing activities responsible and sustainable. Promoting RPGs \nand strengthening financial sector cooperation both feature prominently in ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \noperational priority of supporting RCI. The TA will expand the concepts, practices, and benefits \nof responsible and sustainable financing through the ASEAN+3 financial cooperation platforms, \nincluding GMS countries, while also promoting knowledge sharing with the CAREC countries \n(paras. 6\u20139). The TA is on the list that ADB and the government agreed upon on 22 January 2020.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  After four decades of rapid economic growth, the PRC has become an upper middle-\nincome country, but at a cost of substantial environmental damage and rising inequality. The \nPRC\u2019s 13th Five-Year Plan for 2016\u20132020 calls on the financial sector to play a larger role in \nhelping the country transition to a green, high-quality growth trajectory.5 This transition is expected \nto continue under the forthcoming 14th Five-Year Plan for 2021\u20132025. However, the financial \nsector remains undeveloped in key aspects of responsible and sustainable financing, especially \nin the adoption of important concepts and standards developed globally in recent years. These \n \n1  Blue finance refers to the support to the sustainable use of marine resources while preserving the health of ocean \necosystem. Reducing the land-based pollution to the ocean is a key area.  \n2  ASEAN includes 11 Southeast Asian countries. ASEAN+3 add the PRC, Japan, and Republic of Korea. GMS \nincludes 5 Southeast Asian countries and the PRC along the Mekong River. CAREC includes 11 Central West Asian \ncountries and the PRC. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of the ADB website on 11 September 2020. The title of \nthe TA was revised to better reflect the scope of the TA. \n4  ADB. 2016. Transforming Partnership: People\u2019s Republic of China and Asian Development Bank, 2016\u20132020. Manila; \nADB. 2019. Strategy 2030: Operational Plan for Priority 7: Fostering Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2019-\n2024. Manila. \n5  National Development and Reform Commission. 2016. 13th Five-Year Plan (2016\u20132020). Beijing. ADB. 2016. \nOperational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n ", " \n2 \ninclude the Principles for Responsible Investments (PRI),6 the Equator Principles;7 environment, \nsocial, and governance (ESG) analysis; and the sustainability disclosure standards of the Global \nReporting Initiative (GRI).8 As of 2020, only seven commercial banks in the PRC have issued a \ntotal of 36 ESG-related products, and only five commercial banks have adopted the Equator \nPrinciples. GRI requirements for banks and capital markets are yet to be introduced and adopted.  \n \n4.  In particular most regional based financial institutions, such as city and rural commercial \nbanks and other small financial institutions, are unaware of these international best practices. \nThey also lack the capacity to implement innovative financing products needed to advance the \ncountry\u2019s environment and social development agenda. Likewise, adopting some responsible and \nsustainable financing practices, such as the Equator Principles, is still on a voluntary basis, and \nthere have been few benchmarks. Therefore, introducing, formalizing, and expanding responsible \nand sustainable financing best practices is imperative.  \n \n5.  Because  the  PRC  has  the  second-largest  economy  in  the  world,  an  expansion  in \nresponsible and sustainable financing can materially improve regional environmental conditions, \nwhich will generate significant RPGs. The PRC will gain valuable knowledge and practical \nexperiences through its responsible and sustainable financing development process. Sharing \nsuch knowledge and experiences in the region, particularly in promoting international best \npractices, will expand learning and green finance development across countries and support \nfinancial sector RCI. Through these regional platforms, ADB will also leverage the TA resources \nto promote (i) green and sustainable business development opportunities, (ii) the transfer of \nsustainable and green technologies, and (iii) project-level trade and investment opportunities such \nas  linking  PRC  investment  to  regional  green  projects.  These  are  to  be  achieved  through \nmechanisms such as (i) the ASEAN+3 financial cooperation platforms of the Asian Bond Markets \nInitiative (ABMI), including the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF), the ASEAN+3 \nBond Market Forum, and the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (ACMF); and (ii) the CAREC platform. \nThe resulting improved asset quality (e.g., by reducing the project environmental and social \ncompliance risk) and the development of more sustainable asset class (e.g., from green and blue \nbonds) with alternative risk-return structure will bring in concrete benefits to capital markets \ndevelopment and more sustainable infrastructure investments.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: the PRC\u2019s sustainable development and \nregional  cooperation  promoted.  The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome:  responsible  and \nsustainable financing in ASEAN (inclusive of GMS), CAREC, and the PRC, improved. The TA will \nhave four key outputs.  \n  \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Strategy, policy, and technical advice on responsible and sustainable \nfinancing in the People\u2019s Republic of China provided. The TA will develop a strategic \nframework for responsible and sustainable financing to support the transformation of PRC\u2019s \n \n6  The PRI is a voluntary and aspirational set of investment principles that offers a menu of possible actions for  \nincorporating ESG issues into investment practice. \n7  The Equator Principles are a framework adopted by financial institutions for determining, assessing, and managing \nenvironmental and social risks in project financing.  \n8  The GRI standards are the first global standards for sustainability reporting. They represent the global best practice \nfor reporting on a range of economic, environmental, and social impacts. \n ", " \n3 \nfinancial sector over the next CPS cycle (2021\u20132025). This framework will (i) expand and deepen \nthe existing green finance policy and standards, such as to consolidate and align the national and \ninternational taxonomies; (ii) promote international sustainable financing standards (e.g., PRI, \nESG, Equator Principles, and GRI) in domestic financial institutions; and (iii) develop an advanced \ngreen finance information technology (IT) system that could facilitate the financial institutions\u2019 \nadoption of international and national green finance taxonomies and other standards, including \nESG, regulatory reporting, and/or disclosure and public monitoring mechanism.   \n \n8.  Output  2:  Sustainable  financial  sector  regulation  and  supervision  systems \nstrengthened. The TA will support several new initiatives. The China Banking and Insurance \nRegulatory Commission (CBIRC), which regulates the country\u2019s financial institutions, and the \nChina Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), a capital markets regulator, are working to \nintroduce new sustainable finance standards. The TA will support the China Institute of Finance \nand Capital Markets (CIFCM), the CSRC\u2019s research and policy advice arm, to establish an ESG \ninformation disclosure standard for publicly listed companies on the PRC equity markets (e.g., \nthrough an index system of environment-related information). The TA will help reduce the \ninformation asymmetries between the investors and the markets and will enable them to better \nassess ESG compliance risks and price the securities accordingly. The CBIRC is undertaking a \nsimilar initiative for ESG disclosure by commercial banks. In addition, the insurance sector does \nnot  have  internationally  aligned  insurance  solvency  regulatory  equivalence  assessment \nstandards, such as the Insurance Core Principles9 and the risk-based capital mechanism.10 The \nTA will conduct a comparative study on international insurance solvency regulatory equivalence \nassessment rules and develop a robust solvency regulatory equivalence assessment system for \nthe PRC. This will improve the regulation and supervision of the financial markets by introducing \ninternational best practices and strengthening the technical capacity of the regulators. Thus, the \nPRC\u2019s financial institutions will become better equipped to drive its responsible and sustainable \nfinancing agenda over the coming years. \n \n9.  Output  3:  Innovative  financial  products  developed.  To  expand  the  concept  of \nsustainable financing, the TA will help commercial banks and other financial institutions in the \nPRC scale up green and blue finance. The TA will assist financial institutions in the PRC\u2019s green \nfinance pilot zones and other priority areas in developing innovative green finance products to \nincrease their lending volumes for responsible and sustainable financing. For blue finance, the \nfinancial products will improve ocean health by reducing land-based sources of marine pollution, \nsuch  as  plastics  and  wastewater  and  agricultural  runoff.  To  align  with  the  government\u2019s \ncommitment to become carbon neutral by 2060, the TA will explore financial innovations that \nwould contribute to the reduction of the coal-based energy consumption. In addition, the TA will \nreview and develop innovative inclusive finance and digital finance products to address social and \neconomic inequalities. Aging is a severe social and economic challenge in the PRC and the region. \nIn the PRC, the number of people over 60 years old is expected to reach more than 400 million \nby 2030, or about one-third of the PRC\u2019s population, and the country will need about 100,000 \nelderly communities to house 250 million elderly citizens by 2040.11 Because the PRC currently \nhas only 43,000 elderly communities, longevity finance and old age care have emerged as critical \nissues.  This  includes  the  identification  of  innovative  market-based  financial  instruments  to \nstrengthen the long-term care systems in the PRC and beyond. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, \nthe TA will promote regional disaster risk management approaches and disaster risk financing \n \n9 The Insurance Core Principles developed by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors provide a globally \naccepted framework of principles, standards, and guidance for the regulation and supervision of the insurance sector. \n10 Risk-based capital is a method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for a reporting entity to \nsupport its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile.  \n11  ADB. 2020. Innovative Senior Care Industry Finance in the PRC. Consultant\u2019s report. Manila. \n ", " \n4 \nsolutions, including management of responses to communicable diseases and disasters.12 For \nknowledge  sharing  and  business  development,  ADB  will  coordinate  with  prominent  local \ninstitutions such as the Research Center for Green Finance of Tsinghua University and the \nInternational Institute of Green Finance of Central University of Finance and Economics. \n \n10.  Output 4: Support to regional cooperation on responsible and sustainable financing \nenhanced. To generate RPGs and improve RCI, the TA will promote responsible and sustainable \nfinancing and financial innovations through the ASEAN+3 financial cooperation (including the \nGMS countries) and CAREC platforms. The ABMI (including CGIF and ASEAN+3 Bond Market \nForum)  established  under  the  ASEAN+3  financial  cooperation  platform  and/or  the  ACMF \nestablished  by  the  ASEAN  finance  ministers  can  be  enriched  with  expanded  support  for \nsustainable finance.13 The TA will promote the sharing of knowledge and operational experience \non responsible and sustainable financing through the ABMI and/or ACMF. This will be achieved \nthrough  national  and  regional  dissemination  products  and  events,  including  publications, \nworkshops, and conferences that will be hosted jointly with national and regional government \nagencies, regulatory bodies, financial institutions, green finance institutions, and/or academic \ninstitutions across the region. The CAREC 2030 strategy also has a financial and economic \nstability pillar.14 The TA\u2019s responsible and sustainable financing work and the related financial \ninnovation  can  be  shared  through  the  CAREC  platform,  contributing  to  financial  sector \nsustainability in CAREC countries (para. 5). To provide benefits to countries in the region, the TA \nwill support technical advisory work on green bond taxonomy development and green finance IT \nsystem development; and review, advise, and, if feasible, facilitate investments in pilot projects \nsuch as in waste-to-energy. These will generate RPGs throughout the ASEAN+3 (inclusive of \nGMS) and CAREC countries. Beyond knowledge sharing, the TA\u2019s benefits will include promotion \nof international best practices, capital market development, green technologies transfer, and \nimproved  project-level  trade  and  investment.  Through  coordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department and Southeast Asia Department, as well as \nother relevant departments, the TA will complement ADB efforts. For example, the TA will \ncoordinate on the development of local currency green bonds, bond taxonomies, certification \nprocess, and disclosure by learning from the PRC\u2019s experiences.15 The TA will also collaborate \nwith the ADB work on creating ecosystems for green local currency bonds for sustainable \ninfrastructure development in ASEAN+3.16 The TA will promote ocean financing by aligning with \nthe ocean health and marine economy initiative proposed under ADB\u2019s $5 billion Healthy Oceans \nAction Plan launched in 2019.17 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.7 million, of which $497,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), $200,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development Partnership Special Fund,18 and \n$803,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.19 \n \n12 Any cross-cutting theme will be coordinated among relevant departments and divisions under the One ADB \napproach. \n13 Including ASEAN countries plus PRC, Japan, and Republic of Korea. \n14 ADB. 2017.

The Public Management, Financial Sector, and Regional \nCooperation Division of East Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants \nand monitor quality of their work. The implementing agencies will be CBIRC and CIFCM for their \nrespective components (output 2). ADB will use k-Nexus, a database of completed and planned \nknowledge products and services by all ADB departments, to avoid duplicating efforts with the \nknowledge product and services under this TA.
