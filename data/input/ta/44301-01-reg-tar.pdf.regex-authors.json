INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  supports  the  implementation  of  the  Pacific \nApproach 2010\u20132014 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)1 which was endorsed by all Pacific \ndeveloping member country (DMC) governments in September 2009 and by ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors in November 2009. The 2009 Pacific Forum Economic Ministers Meeting requested \nsupport  for  strengthening  statistics  capacity  within  Pacific  DMCs.  The  TA  supports \nimplementation of the Ten-Year Pacific Statistics Strategy (TYPSS), which was endorsed by the \nheads of planning and statistics in July 2010, and the TYPSS Action Plan Phase 1.2 Fact finding \nwas conducted in April 2010 with representatives of the governments of Nauru, Samoa, and \nVanuatu.  A  draft  concept  paper,  under  the  title  Further  Strengthening  Statistics  and  Policy \nSettings in the Pacific, was submitted to Pacific DMC governments and to national and regional \npublic policy agencies for comment. Pacific DMC governments concur with the impact, outcome, \noutputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Economies in all 14 Pacific DMCs can reach increased levels of growth and development, \naccompanied  by  greater  prosperity,  if  better  policies  and  institutions  are  put  in  place  and \nsustained  (footnote  1).  However,  as  both  ADB  and  the  World  Bank  record  in  their  annual \nassessments of policy and institutional settings, policies are commonly not supportive of growth \nand development in the Pacific DMCs.4 Good governance and improved policy and institutional \nsettings are essential for growth but these can only be effectively formulated, implemented, and \nmonitored if supported by accurate and timely statistical information and analysis. There is a \ngrowing demand for improved public policy informed by robust statistical information. \n \n3.  Many Pacific DMCs are characterized by poor capacity in policy formulation and public \nsector management, including weak decision making in the public interest. A lack of social and \neconomic data further impedes the ability of governments and development partners to analyze \nkey development issues to inform policy, strengthen organizational systems, and improve service \ndelivery.  \n \n4.  The governments of the Pacific DMCs have struggled to build, maintain, and update \nadequate statistical databases, including gender statistics, that inform government leadership of \nkey policy issues and concerns. In the absence of sufficient government capacity to construct \nstatistical databases and to analyze and formulate better policy and institutional settings, it has \nlong been left to development partners to support the governments of the Pacific DMCs with such \nassessments and build government capacities. \n \n5.  The impetus for creating sustained improvements in the capacity of Pacific DMCs to \ngenerate and analyze statistical information comes from the demand of Pacific leaders for better \ninformation to improve policy formulation and service delivery of government functions. Moreover, \nregional  demand  for  common  statistics  infrastructure,  common  systems  and  tools,  and \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2009. ADB\u2019s Approach to Assisting the Pacific, 2010\u20132014. Manila. \n2  ADB concerns regarding the TYPSS, as a strategy that can be implemented, have been addressed through a \ndetailed and costed phase 1 action plan for the TYPSS. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 April 2010. \n4  ADB country performance assessments for performance-based allocation for Asian Development Fund countries. \nWorld  Bank  country  policy  and  institutional  assessments  for  performance-based  allocation  for  International \nDevelopment Association countries. \n ", "2 \nharmonized standards methods and instruments lends itself to a regional approach to improving \ncapacity. \n \n6.  In response, the Pacific heads of planning and statistics developed the TYPSS which was \nendorsed at the heads of planning and statistics meeting in July 2010. The TYPSS provides a \nframework and governance structure to improve national capacity through regional coordination \nand integration. A detailed and costed action plan for phase 1 of the TYPSS has been endorsed \nby Pacific DMC members, technical agencies, and development partners. The framework and \naction  plan  encompasses  (i)  improving  capacity  utilizing  development  partner  expertise  and \nthrough  south\u2013south  cooperation;  (ii)  developing  common  standards,  methodologies,  and \ninfrastructure; (iii) using a programmatic approach to household surveys; (iv) improving economic \nand  social  statistics  in  the  region;  (v)  developing  new  instruments  to  meet  Millennium \nDevelopment Goals reporting and other periodic series in a timely manner; and (vi) improving \ndissemination of data and analysis. \n \n7.  In conjunction with other development partners, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance \nCentre  (PFTAC),5 and  the  Statistics  and  Demography  Unit  of  the  Secretariat  of  the  Pacific \nCommunity (SPC), ADB has been working with the statistics departments of all Pacific DMC \ngovernments to strengthen key statistical data sets and domestic capacities to undertake such \nwork.6 Previous  technical  assistance  has  had  mixed  results.  Numerous  valuable  statistical \nproducts  have  been  developed.  These  have  been  used  to  improve  policy  formulation  and \nimplementation. There has been improvement of Pacific DMC capacity but without continued \nsupport this will never be sustained. \n \n8.  Lessons learned through previous TA projects have been incorporated. These lessons are \nthe need for (i) greater regional and development partner cooperation, (ii) implementation of a \nregional plan for technical and financial support, (iii) greater flexibility in timing of activities, and (iv) \ndeveloping regional capacity and supporting capacity development through regional expertise \nwithin national statistics offices (NSOs). Many countries\u2019 do NSOs not have the human and \nfinancial resources to prepare the number and variety of statistical products demanded of them. \nThis  results  in  competing  priorities  and  inefficient  delivery  of  outputs.  Time  lags  between \nstatistical surveys limit skill retention. Personnel movements have also hampered the creation of \na skilled cadre of individuals within the individual NSOs.  \n \n9.  The TYPSS Phase 1 Action Plan (2011\u20132014) addresses these problems through a \nregional  approach  to  strengthening  statistics  capacity.  It  brings  together  all  the  NSOs  and \ndevelopment  partners  in  support  of  a  programmed  approach  within  the  region.  Its  agreed \nobjectives are that (i) countries undertake key statistical collections as scheduled, (ii) countries \nproduce  the  agreed  core  set  of  statistics  across  key  sectors,  (iii)  countries  have  their  own \ncapacity  or  are  accessing  regional  capacity  to  undertake  agreed  core  and  some  specialist \nstatistical functions, (iv) data accessibility and utilization is improved, (v) new and innovative \nstatistical tools and systems are introduced, and (vi) national and regional statistics governance is \nfunctioning effectively. \n \n                                                 \n5  PFTAC engagement is coordinated with the International Monetary Fund which provides technical back-up. \n6  Earlier TAs include: ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building and Regional Cooperation for Economic \nStatistics  in  Selected  Pacific  Developing  Member  Countries.  Manila  (TA  6009-REG);  ADB.  2004.  Technical \nAssistance for Strengthening Poverty Based Analysis in the Pacific. Manila (TA 6157-REG); ADB. 2005. Technical \nAssistance for Demographic and Health Survey in Pacific Island Countries. Manila (TA 6258-REG); and ADB. 2007. \nTechnical Assistance for Support for Results Based Management in the Pacific. Manila (TA 6414-REG). \n ", "  3 \n10.  The  region  will  work  collaboratively  through  the  TYPSS  Pacific  Statistics  Steering \nCommittee  (PSSC)  to  achieve  these  objectives.7 External  support  and  collaboration  will  be \nutilized to strengthen capacity and deliver statistical services through sharing resources within the \nregion, developing common tools and approaches, and programming external resources on a \nregional basis to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of this support. An action plan with cost \nestimates for phase 1 has been developed, which identifies institutions responsible for actions. A \nmonitoring and evaluation framework, endorsed by the TYPSS PSSC, to facilitate the PSSC\u2019s \nmanagement of the TYPSS is also incorporated into the phase 1 action plan. \n \n11.  Nevertheless, the sector remains underfunded. External financing will still be required to \nmeet the high costs of conducting surveys and other activities including capacity building.8 While \nsouth-south cooperation will extend the skills already in the region to other Pacific DMCs, the \ncosts of this collaboration will need to be supported. Development partners will continue to \nsupport very specialized training, although this need is declining.  \n \n12.  Ongoing support is consistent with ADB\u2019s long term support to strengthening statistics in \nthe Pacific. It is consistent with the Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014. The TA will contribute to these \nfinancing gaps and continue to provide technical support to strengthening statistics in the Pacific. \nThe TA will support some of the financing and technical assistance gaps identified in the TYPSS \nand coordinate this support within the region and with other development partners.9 By improving \nthe quality of statistics in the Pacific and by working towards sustained statistical capacity within \nPacific DMCs, greater evidence-based policy development is possible. Moreover, timely statistics \nwill improve the quality of service delivery in the region. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n13.  The TA impact will be that Pacific DMC governments adopt evidence-based policies in \nselected areas. These policies will be based on improved social and economic data developed \nthrough the TA. The outcome is that NSOs provide accurate and comprehensive social and \neconomic indicators. The TA will build capacity in Pacific DMCs to collect and compile robust \nsocial and economic statistics and present these in a timely manner. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The methodology for the TA is to target specific unfunded gaps in the TYPSS which \nprovide direct and immediate benefits to Pacific DMCs. The outputs and activities are also \ndirected towards implementing the TYPSS Phase 1 Action Plan\u2019s early and initial activities so that \nthere is a sound basis for further capacity building during the remaining 4 years of phase 1. \n \n15.  The TA will therefore support the ongoing regional survey plan by financing the survey \ncosts in two of household income and expenditure surveys (HIES) and two of the demographic \nand health surveys (DHS). ADB has supported HIES and DHS over the past decade. To place \ncapacity building activities under the TYPSS on firm footing for future support, the TA will also \n                                                 \n7 The TYPSS PSSC has six members from the Pacific, two members from development partners including ADB, and \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \ntwo members from technical agencies. \n8m  Uemnfubnedrse,d  Bsouravredy  ocfo Dstisr efocrt oHrIsE, SM aannda DgeHmS eanlotn, eo ra sreta $ff4,  manildlio mn a20y1 b0e\u2013 2p0r1e5li.m Sinomarey  oinf  tnheastuer ceo. s ts are likely to be met \nthrough bilateral funding arrangements. ADB support to surveys in the past has leveraged additional finances of \n2.1:1. The costing of the core elements of the plan are $10 million over 5 years which is being met by AusAID. \n9  Through the TYPSS, the R-CDTA will coordinate and integrate other ADB technical assistance in the regional \nstrategy including R-CDTA 7656 Promoting Evidence-Based Policy Making for Gender Equity in the Pacific. \n ", "4 \nprepare economic statistics development strategies in each Pacific DMC, capacity assessments, \nand skill audits. These activities will result in: (i) surveys being undertaken and the data being \navailable, (ii) an improvement of economic statistics and the integrity of economic data, and (iii) \nimproved capacity in economic and household statistics. The TA will also include resources to \nfacilitate integration of the TA with the resources and assistance of other development partners \nand NSOs to implement the TYPSS in a coordinated regional approach. \n \n16.  Delivering  household  surveys. Many social and economic statistics are derived, or \nverified, through household surveys conducted every 5\u201310 years. The TA will support the Pacific \nhousehold survey program encompassing HIES and DHS.10 The TA will contribute to the direct \ncosts of the surveys while technical inputs will be provided by the NSOs, SPC, and United \nNations agencies and not be charged to the TA. Supporting the ongoing implementation of the \nPacific household survey program will remain a key element of ADB\u2019s support for statistics in the \nregion, as it is for other development partners. The TA will meet the cost of selected surveys in 4 \ncountries with others being supported by the DMC and/or other development partners. \n \n17.  Improving  national  accounts  and  balance  of  payments.  National  accounts  and \nbalance of payments represent the most important annual series of economic statistics in the \nregion. The TA will support the development of explicit plans in each Pacific DMC for improving \nthe production of economic statistical series. This is an area of statistical production, which is \nparticularly poor in the Pacific. These explicit plans for improving economic statistics will be \nsupported  by  targeted  short-term  technical  support  provided  by  the  PFTAC,  SPC,  and  the \nAustralian  Bureau  of  Statistics.  In  addition,  a  group  of  eminent  Pacific  national  accounts \npractitioners  will  be  seconded  to  NSOs  within  the  region  to  assist  with  preparing  national \naccounts and balance of payments accounts and helping build staff capacity. Their salaries will \nbe met by their originating NSOs, and the TA will support the travel costs of the program. \n \n18.  Building capacity. Implementation of the TYPSS will include direct capacity building of \nNSOs by regional organizations, development partners, and regional statisticians. In developing \nthe TYPSS, agreement has been reached on the gap between what statistics should and are \nbeing prepared in Pacific DMCs. The TA will support capacity development by undertaking a \ncapacity assessment and needs assessment in each of the Pacific DMCs. In some instances, this \nwill build on the work already completed in some NSOs on compiling the national statistics \nstrategies. The outcomes of the assessments will be utilized by the University of the South Pacific \nin revising its statistics certificate and diploma programs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,150,000. Of the total amount, $1,000,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The \nremainder  of  the  cost  ($150,000)  will  be  through  in-kind  contributions  by  participating \ngovernments. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. A national consultant (national program \ncoordinator) will (i) maintain the TYPSS monitoring framework, (ii) assist the chair of the PSSC, \n(iii) review technical papers, and (iv) assist ADB manage and monitor the performance of the TA. \n                                                 \n10 The funds for the household survey program will be pooled by development partners and further supplemented by       \nPacific DMC funds. External funding from other development partners may be country specific as each survey is \nbeing  prepared.  The  TYPSS  PSSC  will  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  survey  program  and  its  funding \nrequirements. \n ", "  5 \nEight  person-months  of  national  consultant  input  will  be  required  to  assist  in  the  program \nmanagement. The consultant will have expertise in specific areas of statistics, household surveys, \nand operations in an NSO. The consultant will be hired on an individual basis by ADB. \n \n22.  The SPC will be contracted as a firm on the basis of single-source selection to implement \noutputs 1\u20133. The SPC is the regional organization responsible for technical support to Pacific \nDMCs  in  statistics  under  the  Pacific  Plan.  SPC  will  be  responsible  for  coordination  of \ndevelopment assistance on statistics in the region against the Phase 1 Action Plan. SPC will: (i) \nmanage the delivery of HIESs, (ii) manage the delivery of the DHSs, (iii) oversee the preparation \nof regional capacity assessments and training needs analysis, (iv) manage the south\u2013south \ncooperation program, and (v) assist with the preparation of economic statistics strategies in each \ncountry. The SPC will coordinate and support the work of each country\u2019s NSO, provide expert \nadvice  and  management  oversight  of  each  activity,  and  will  meet  reasonable  costs  for  the \ndelivery of the outputs in accordance with the budget.  \n \n23.  The development partners supporting statistics in the Pacific have endorsed the TYPSS \nand the TYPSS Action Plan Phase 1, and are represented in the PSSC. The PSSC coordinates \ntechnical support from the PFTAC, United Nations agencies, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, \nand New Zealand Statistics in alignment with the Action Plan Phase 1. Technical assistance by \ndevelopment partners will be provided and not be charged to the TA. The TA will meet the travel \ncosts where necessary. In particular, the TA will support the travel cost of national statisticians in \nthe region under secondment to other NSOs as a part of the TYPSS strategy to foster south-\nsouth cooperation. SPC will act as the Secretariat for the TYPSS and there will be considerable \noverlap between their role as the region\u2019s Secretariat and the services provided under the TA. \n \n24.  The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The project will be carried out over 40 months \nfrom January 2011 to August 2014. This aligns with phase 1 of the TYPSS. Financing of any \nactivities funded by this proposed TA will commence in a participating Pacific DMC only after \nADB  has  received  a  written  statement  of  no-objection  from  the  participating  Pacific  DMC \ngovernment. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). Any procurement will \nbe done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \nIf procurement of vehicles or equipment does occur, these will be transferred to the relevant \ngovernment at the end of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis by \nthe Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for Building Capacity for Statistics in the Pacific, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \n    Data Sources and   \nDesign  Performance Targets and \nReporting  Assumptions and Risks  \nSummary  Indicators with Baselines \nMechanisms    \nImpact      Assumption \nPacific DMC  A half point improvement in  Review of ADB CPA  Adequate support in political \ngovernments adopt  CPA rating in each of the  scores  economy for use of statistics \nevidence-based  selected policy areas in each of  and improved policy and \npolicies in selected  the selected Pacific DMCs by  institutional settings in \nareas  2014  individual Pacific DMCs \n   \nOutcome      Assumptions \nNSOs provide more  National minimum data set is  Annual monitoring  Adequate assessment of \naccurate and  compiled for an average of  report to the TYPSS  demand by Pacific DMCs for \ncomprehensive social  50% of indicators in all Pacific  steering committee on  economic and social \nand economic  DMCs by 2014 (baseline is  minimum data set  indicators \nindicators  average of 20% of indicators in     \n2009).
