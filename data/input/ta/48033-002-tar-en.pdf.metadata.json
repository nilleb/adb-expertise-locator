INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support and enhance road \nsafety initiatives in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) countries.1 It builds \non the work of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) TA for Enhancing Road Safety for Central \nAsia Regional Economic Cooperation Member Countries.2 It will facilitate regional policy dialogue, \nknowledge sharing, and a coordinated approach to common road safety challenges. It will also \nexplore opportunities for stand-alone road safety projects in CAREC member countries that \naddress both infrastructure and other elements of the safe system approach at scale.3 \n \n2.  The TA will equip CAREC member countries with the necessary skills and knowledge \nproducts to respond to road safety challenges and achieve their commitments under the United \nNations Sustainable Development Goals.4 It is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030, the CAREC \nTransport Strategy 2030, and ADB\u2019s operational plan for regional cooperation and integration, \n2019\u20132024.5 It will also help implement ADB\u2019s Safely Connected: A Regional Road Safety \nStrategy for CAREC Countries, 2017\u20132030.6  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Road crashes are a recognized problem in the CAREC region, where traffic fatality rates \nrange from 8.7 to 18.1 per 100,000 people and the economic cost of road crashes ranges from \n1%\u20135% of gross domestic product.7 Road safety is an important pillar in CAREC 2030 to expand \nand improve trade and transport facilitation in the region.8 Several CAREC member countries \nhave adopted national road safety strategies; however, they are generally under-resourced with \nno proper accountability.9 To achieve an adequate level of safety, CAREC countries need to \ncoordinate road safety activities across the region. \n \n4.  Phase 1 of ADB\u2019s TA for Enhancing Road Safety for CAREC Member Countries (footnote \n2), which was implemented from December 2014 to May 2019, focused on the safer roads of \npillar 2 in the CAREC Road Safety Strategy.10 It built awareness of road safety engineering \nprinciples and developed the framework for regional cooperation in road safety. Phase 1 had \nthree main outputs: (i) CAREC road safety strategy published (footnote 8); (ii) strengthened \n \n1 CAREC member countries include Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, \nPakistan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. \n2  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Enhancing Road Safety for Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \nMember Countries. Manila (TA 8804-REG). \n3  Safe system approach involves reducing road crash deaths and injuries by adopting international good practice in \nroad safety, and building on efforts for safer road infrastructure, safer vehicles, and safer road users. It seeks to \nmaximize safety by improving road design and construction, ensuring that vehicles are safe, making sure that traffic \nlaws are effective and well enforced, that road users understand how to use the road network safely, and that there \nare adequate emergency medical care facilities in the event of injury caused by a crash. \n4   United Nations.

Three  road  safety \nengineering manuals on road safety audit, safer road works, and roadside hazard management \nwere published.11 \n \n5.  The road safety strategy\u2019s vision is to make CAREC international road corridors safe, \nefficient, and attractive for all road users. In implementing the strategy, ADB identified the \nfollowing needs and gaps that the TA will address:  \n(i)  Strengthen the governments\u2019 capacity for road safety data collection and analysis \nusing big data to guide road safety interventions. Poor road safety data generates \nlimitations  in  every  aspect  of  road  safety  management  and  delivery,  including \nresource allocation, advocacy, intervention selection, and prioritization of resources.  \n(ii)  Institutionalize the capacity enhancements on road safety engineering achieved in \nPhase 1. This includes initiating and developing a road safety engineering (RSE) \nunit within a national road authority, exploring the establishment of a national (or \nCAREC)  accreditation  system,  and  continuing  training  to  build  a  culture  of \ncontinuous  improvement  and  ensure  RSE  units  incorporate  international  best \npractices into the design, construction, and operation of their road networks.  \n(iii)  Address specific actions identified in the strategy action plan, such as creating a \nCAREC road safety working group to share standards and regulations and review \nlegislation and enforcement practices in the region.12 \n(iv)  Develop  multidisciplinary,  cross-institutional,  and  regional  mechanisms  on  road \nsafety, collaborate with South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) to \nshare experience and knowledge on road safety, and embed the principles for road \nsafety engineering developed in Phase 1 with other principles from the safe system \nto generate stand-alone road safety projects. \n \n6.  Road safety is a complex issue with multiple factors and interfaces, such as people, \nvehicle, roads, and institutions. It requires adopting systems which include both soft and hard \ninterventions across multiple sectors and levels of government. Because many of the issues listed \nabove are common to the CAREC region, the second phase of the regional TA approach will \nbenefit all CAREC member countries, allowing efficiency gains from joint capacity building and \nknowledge sharing activities.  \n \n7.  The TA will incorporate lessons and achievements from Phase 1 and other ongoing ADB \nTA including: (i) engaging more strongly at the national level; (ii) identifying opportunities to \nintegrate  safety  features  into  road  projects;  (iii)  implementing  infrastructure  improvements \nsimultaneously with soft interventions including enforcement, campaigns, and education; and (iv) \nachieving road safety with leadership, orchestrated action, and accountability. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: CAREC international road corridors made \nsafe, efficient, and attractive for all road users (footnote 5). The TA will have the following outcome: \n \n11 ADB. 2018. CAREC Road Safety Engineering Manual 1: Road Safety Audit. Manila; ADB. 2018. CAREC Road Safety \nEngineering Manual 2: Safer Road Works. Manila; and ADB. 2018. CAREC Road Safety Engineering Manual 3: \nRoadside Hazard Management. Manila. \n12 This may include (i) standards for vehicle load limits, insurance requirements, and design standards; and (ii) \nlegislation and enforcement practices, such as licensing requirements and practices, in the region. \n ", "3 \ncapacity of CAREC member countries to address key road safety issues in their respective \ncountries strengthened.13  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Road safety engineering capacity in road agencies improved. The TA will \ninitiate, develop, or expand RSE capabilities within a national road authority, or other appropriate \nbody, by (i) developing an operational plan for an RSE unit to give it a clear statement of direction; \n(ii) conducting national, regional, and/or subregional workshops to provide specialist road safety \naudit and blackspot remediation training; (iii) accrediting attendees at audit workshops; (iv) \nreviewing  and  improving  engineering  design  standards  in  CAREC  countries;  (v)  exploring \nestablishment of a national (or CAREC) accreditation system; (vi) exploring and developing road \nsafety stand-alone projects; and (vii) cross-subregional knowledge sharing on RSE best practice \nwith regional and subregional bodies, including SASEC. \n \n10.  Output 2: Cross-institutional road safety collaboration and data collection capacity \nimproved. This will involve (i) partnering with the Asia-Pacific Road Safety Observatory to \ndevelop data standards for crash reporting, which may include a crash reporting form based on a \nminimum set of road safety indicators, a standard crash analysis procedure, and a centralized \nroad crash database; (ii) sharing best practices and recommendations for cross-institutional \ncollaboration for road safety; (iii) creating a CAREC road safety working group; (iv) making \nrecommendations to improve policies and legislative frameworks across CAREC, such as vehicle \nsafety standards, insurance requirements, regulations for used imports, access to crash data, \nvehicle loading and overloading policies, and licensing requirements and practices; and (v) a \ncapacity development program, including (a) road crash data recording, reporting, and analysis, \nparticularly fatal and serious injury crash data; (b) crash investigation and contributing factors \nanalysis; (c) road user awareness; (d) enforcement based on general and specific deterrence \nprinciples;  and  (e)  cross-institutional  cooperation  for  improved  road  safety  policies  and \nmanagement. The project team will encourage participatory approaches involving stakeholder \ngroups,  including  youth,  transport  operators,  and  local  NGOs,  particularly  for  developing \nawareness and policy interventions. \n \n11.  Output 3: Intelligent road safety information systems developed and deployed. The \nTA  will  investigate  and  develop  selected  information  and  communication  technology-based \nsolutions to improve road safety, which may include one or more real-time incident warning \napplications, intelligent speed signs, digital enforcement, mobile-based crash data collection and \nanalysis software and tools, and other possible solutions which could be deployed to all the \nCAREC member countries. \n \n12.  Output 4: Knowledge products disseminated. Building on the RSE manuals developed \nunder Phase 1, this TA will produce manuals and accompanying online videos on topics which \nmay include (i) digital enforcement in CAREC member countries, (ii) traffic calming measures, (iii) \ncrash investigations of hazardous locations, (iv) bicycle safety, (v) safety on mountainous roads, \n(vi) signs and line markings and delineations, and (vii) evidence of good and poor road safety \npractices (lessons learned in CAREC highway projects). ADB will select the final prioritized topics \nin consultation with the CAREC countries at the 2021 CAREC Transport Sector Coordinating \nCommittee Meeting. \n \n \n \n13 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, of which (i) $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6) and (ii) $1,200,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.14 The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will administer the TA. A dedicated team from the Transport and Communications \nDivision of the Central and West Asia Department and the East Asia Sustainable Infrastructure \nDivision of the East Asia Department will implement the TA, including recruiting consultants, \norganizing  workshops  and  conferences,  and  monitoring  the  TA\u2019s  progress.  The  team  will \nimplement the TA in close coordination and consultations with ADB resident missions, East Asia \nDepartment, South Asia Department, and CAREC Transport Sector Coordinating Committee. TA \nproject implementation will also follow the additional monitoring and reporting requirements \nspecific to the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund.15 \n \n15.  TA implementation emphasizes coordination with World Bank and other development \npartners of CAREC program. ADB will implement the TA in partnership with other agencies to \ncoordinate and enable sharing of expertise and/or experience.16 The project team will also \ncollaborate  with  SASEC  and  implement  the  TA  alongside  the  Asia-Pacific  Road  Safety \nObservatory to ensure a holistic approach and no duplication of efforts in the region.17 \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from December 2020 to December 2022. \nADB will engage about 39 person-months of international and 43 person-months of national \nconsulting services. ADB will recruit the international consultants either individually or engage a \nfirm, which would be determined during implementation. Other activities to be financed by the TA \nmay include study tours, seminars, and workshops.  \n \n17.  Because the precise scope of the studies will be defined during implementation, ADB will \nmaintain flexibility in engaging the specialists. Once the scope of the studies is defined and agreed \nupon with CAREC governments, the CAREC secretariat will prepare detailed terms of reference \nfor the consultants. Where appropriate, ADB will consider lump-sum or output-based contracts \nfor these services. Where the consulting terms of reference call for the services of a firm, ADB\u2019s \nProcurement, Portfolio, and Financial Management Department may be consulted.  \n \n18.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n \n14 Established by ADB.
