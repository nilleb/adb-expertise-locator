INTRODUCTION\n1. The recent financial crisis in Asia exposed a number of structural weaknesses in the\naffected countries.  What began initially in 1997 as disturbances in the currency and capital\nmarkets in Indonesia, Republic of Korea, and Thailand, revealed deeper structural problems in\nthe banking and corporate sectors owing largely to poor governance, lack of transparency, and\nweak  supervision  and  regulation.    In  particular,  weak  corporate  governance  was  partly\nresponsible for poor investment decisions; risky financing practices; and the resulting large-\nscale,  nonperforming  loans  in  the  financial  sector  and  the  growing  number  of  corporate\nbankruptcies.\n2. In the wake of the crisis, governments and the private sector throughout Southeast and\nEast  Asia  face  many  complex  problems  and  challenges  in  macroeconomic  management,\nbanking and capital markets management, and development of institutional capacity for the\nenforcement of a more effective regulatory and supervisory framework for sound corporate and\nfinancial  governance.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  been  taking  a  number  of\ninitiatives to assist developing member countries (DMCs) in all these areas.  In the case of good\ngovernance, the initiatives include the institution of controls to safeguard against corruption in its\noperations through a range of anticorruption policies and measures.  In addition, the focus on\nimproved governance in ADB operations integrates capacity-building initiatives to enhance the\neffectiveness of public administration and development management at the sector level and in\nnational institutions in the DMCs.  Where appropriate, institutional development of the local and\nprovincial agencies and the private sector is also covered.  Broader and deeper knowledge of\nfinancial management and prudent financial policies afford countries the stability, efficiency, and\naccess needed for prosperity and poverty alleviation.  A sound regulatory financial framework\nand its enforcement, capable institutions, skilled human resources, and effective monitoring and\nsupervision are important preconditions to an efficient and resilient financial structure.\n3. To  promote  sustainable  growth,  substantial  resources  and  investments  have  to  be\nallocated by both the private and public sectors.  In this context, a sound financial architecture is\nboth  critical  and  a  prime  enabler  of  a  strong  economy.    Such  an  architecture  covering\nmanagement, institutional mechanisms, and good governance practices needs to be developed\nin the DMCs to enable them to achieve the goal of sustainable economic growth.  Quality\naccounting and auditing support, along with good governance, are principal tools for furthering\naccountability and transparency1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n4. The crisis that affected a number of DMCs in 1997 highlighted the need to  implement\ngood governance in order to ensure the economic and financial viability of public and private\nsector entities in the DMCs.    An important aspect for good governance is to have an effective\nsystem  of  financial  management  applied  in  the  DMCs.    The  need  for  sound  financial\nmanagement  and  governance  globally  was  highlighted  recently  by  the  Organization  for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  Donor groups, such as G7 and G102, are\n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) in November 1999.\n2  Group of 7 (G7) is composed of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom, and United States,\nGroup of 10 (G10) is composed of Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden,\nUnited Kingdom, and United States.", "2\nalso actively encouraging aid recipients to improve their financial management and governance\nthrough the use of international accounting and auditing standards.  It is vital that developments\nalong the line of financial management and governance are adapted to the requirements in\ninternal control and transparency expected from global financial operations.  ADB has, since the\nearly 1980s, assisted several countries through provision of loans and technical assistance\nintended  for  the  improvement  of  financial  reporting,  training,  and  improvement  of  auditing\ncapabilities.  The activities were undertaken on a country-by-country basis without a thorough\nassessment of the overall situation.  The World Bank has, over the years, also provided similar\nforms of assistance.  However, given the global push to improve financial management in the\ncontext of overall improvement in governance, a more coordinated approach is now called for.\n5. Sound financial governance requires the adoption of the International Accounting and\nAuditing Standards (IAAS)3 in the recording and preparation of financial reports.  To avoid\nconfusion and to ensure global consistency in the preparation and presentation of financial\nreports, there is a need to adopt a common set of standards under which financial reports are\nprepared and audited.  Although a lot of work still needs to be done as regards institutional\nstrengthening by the public and private sectors, steps in this direction will have to be initiated\nprimarily by international financial institutions, including ADB, in close collaboration with private\nsector organizations and professional bodies.  The DMCs have, by and large, reacted positively\nto a call from the donor groups to improve the quality of their financial management and\ngovernance  practices.  They  see  the  benefit  of  having  sound  financial  management  and\ngovernance in place. They realize that this is needed for them to eradicate corruption and to\nenhance  public  confidence  in  their  development  efforts.  This  fact  has  been  highlighted  in\nseveral international forums, and most recently at the World Bank and International Monetary\nFund (IMF) Annual Meeting in September 1999.  The problem confronting these countries in\nimproving their financial management and adopting IAAS is their serious lack of capacity and\ncapability  to  take  on  this  task.  They  have  indicated  that  they  will  look  to  the  multilateral\ndevelopment banks and other donors to assist them in their capacity building efforts in this\nregard. For the multilateral development banks and donors to assist the DMCs in their capacity\nbuilding effectively, there is an urgent need to assess the currently available capability and\ncapacity in these countries. The assessment should include, among other things, the availability\nof trained personnel, the existence of an organized accounting and auditing profession, and the\nlevel and source of assistance that is being provided to improve the current situation.  Such an\nassessment  and  diagnostic  work  will  enable  ADB  to  have  a  good  understanding  of  the\nprevailing situation in the accounting and auditing profession and regulatory framework in each\nDMC.  With such knowledge and information base, ADB will be in a better position to develop\nmeaningful and effective assistance programs covering these vital areas.  ADB programs and\nprojects divisions will be able to design more relevant and appropriate assistance packages for\nthe  concerned  countries  with  the  benefit  of  the  information  obtained  from  the  technical\nassistance.\n6. This assessment and diagnostic task is enormous, and there is broad consensus among\nthe donor community that it has to be undertaken as a joint effort.  The World Bank started this\nassessment through its Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) program and are\ncurrently drawing up an action plan to assist several DMCs in this effort. ADB has been asked to\nbe an equal partner and take an active role in this activity.  Undertaking the assessment and\ndiagnostic reviews for all of ADB\u2019s 38 borrowing member countries, while necessary, will be\ntime-consuming  and  can  only  be  achieved  over  a  long  period.    The  work  also  must  be\nundertaken in close collaboration with other donors (such as the World Bank and IMF) and the\n                                                \n3  It should be noted that the ADB currently does not mandate its DMCs to use IAAS, but encourages them to do so.", "3\nDMC Governments and their regulatory authorities.  The pragmatic way forward, however, is to\nstart the process in a limited way and expand coverage of the DMCs progressively in the\ncoming years.\n7. Under the TA, ADB will assess the situation in seven of its DMCs that are not covered by\nother donors and for which profiles are not currently available from other sources. Upon the\ncompletion of the initial work, the assessment and diagnostic review work are to be expanded to\nprogressively cover other DMCs until a satisfactory profile of each DMC can be made.  In\nselecting the seven countries, consideration will be given to such factors as (i) the involvement\nof other donors (to avoid duplication of effort), (ii) the extent of ADB\u2019s involvement in projects\nand  programs,  (iii)  the  commitment  of  the  government  and  other  relevant  agencies  and\norganizations  to  implement  the  proposed  improvements  in  their  accounting  and  auditing\nsupport, and (iv) geographic location to achieve diversity.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n8. ADB has, since 1995, demonstrated its stand on the importance of good governance,\nthrough effective financial management, for sustained economic development.  The TA will\ncarry out a diagnostic review of the existing accounting and auditing support and standards\navailable in the selected DMCs.  After carrying out this diagnostic analysis, the TA will assess\nthe need for assistance to improve the current situation.  The objectives of the TA are to (i)\nassess the capability and capacity within a selected DMC to provide efficient and effective\naccounting  and  auditing  support  to  meet  international  standards  and  best  practices;  (ii)\ndetermine the existing accounting and auditing standards of the selected DMCs; (iii) assess the\ndegree of deviation from the IAAS while identifying weaknesses and possible options; (iv)\nintroduce the concepts of the international standards through workshops; (v) develop reference\nmaterials for potential users of the IAAS; and (vi) determine the level and type of assistance\nneeded by the selected DMCs in order to provide acceptable accounting and auditing support to\nthe private and public sectors (the TA framework is in Appendix 1).\nB.  Scope\n9. The TA will involve an in-depth study of the key issues relating to accounting and\nauditing  support  in  the  selected  DMCs,  identify  gaps  and  weaknesses  that  need  to  be\naddressed to improve accounting and auditing support, and develop assistance programs in\ncollaboration with other donors to rectify the identified weaknesses with a view to improving the\naccounting and auditing support being provided.  Seven DMCs will be selected in consultation\nwith ADB\u2019s two programs departments, the Office of the Pacific Operations, and the relevant\noperational divisions responsible for this activity.  To ensure that there is no duplication of effort,\nthe country selection will also take into account the activities of other organizations involved in\nsimilar activities.\n10. The TA will be organized into 4 parts.\n11. Part One: Country Case Studies on Available Accounting and Auditing Support\nand Structure.    This  part  will  examine  the  current  accounting  and  auditing  structure  and\nsystems adopted in the selected DMCs.  It will also (i) analyze the political, institutional, and", "4\nregulatory and legal framework on accounting and auditing practice of each selected country\nand the level of enforcement of existing laws, rules, and regulations; (ii) identify gaps and\nweaknesses in accounting and auditing support available and deviations from international\nstandards; and (iii) identify alternative options to remedy the identified weaknesses, with the\nobjective of eventually doing away with these.\n12. Part Two: Conduct of Workshops.  This part will disseminate the findings of the\ncountry research through in-country workshops.  Each workshop will provide a cross-section of\nviews on the findings of the research and will establish ways to move forward to improve\nfinancial management and governance in the country.  An awareness program on IAAS will be\ngiven through the workshops.  Representatives of government agencies, professional bodies,\ndonors, and other interest groups will be invited to attend the workshops.\n13. Part Three: Development of Reference Materials.  This part involves the development\nof  materials  that  will  serve  as  references  for  current  and  future  accounting  and  auditing\npractitioners as regards the prevailing capabilities and capacity in delivering sound accounting\nand auditing support based on IAAS.  In developing the reference materials, consideration will\nbe given to (i) alternative transition systems and associated benchmarks as well as underlying\ninstitutional prerequisites, and (ii) production of materials in the local language if the information\ncan thereby be better disseminated.\n14. Part Four: Formulation of Action Plan.  The fourth part will assess the roles that ADB\nand other funding agencies can play in improving the current situation in the selected DMCs.\nThe roles could include policy intervention, projects and program assistance, and mobilization of\ncofinancing resources to address the identified problems and weaknesses. This activity will be\nundertaken in close consultation with the governments, regulatory authorities, representatives of\nthe accounting and auditing professions, and other local interest groups and funding agencies.\nAt this stage of the TA, the firm commitment of the selected DMCs to implement the findings\nand recommendations of the study will be sought.  Finally, the findings of the TA will be\ndisseminated and debated at a conference in Manila and the developed action plan will be\nfinalized for immediate implementation.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n15. The estimated cost of the TA is $400,000 (Appendix 2).  The study will be financed by\nADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n16. Two  international  consultants  specializing  in  multisectoral  accounting  and  auditing\npractice will be engaged for six person-months each to conduct individual country studies for the\nseven selected countries and to prepare country reports.  The consultants will prepare an issues\npaper, and the consolidated report integrating the findings and implications of the individual\ncountry reports.  The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants.  Both consultants will be engaged on an individual basis and will work\nunder  the  supervision  of  the  Lead  Financial  Specialist  in  Economics  and  Development\nResource Center (EDRC).  The study will be supervised and coordinated by EDRC, working\nclosely with staff of ADB\u2019s programs departments, the Office of the Pacific Operations, Central\nOperations Services Office, Controller\u2019s Department, Office of the General Auditor, and other\nrelevant  departments  and  individuals.  This  coordination  will  be  done  through  an", "5\ninterdepartmental advisory panel to be established for the TA.  The outline terms of reference\nfor the consultants is in Appendix 3.\n17. The TA will commence in early March 2000 and conclude in early September 2000.  The\nworkshops  will  be  held  progressively  during  the  course  of  TA  implementation  and  a  final\nconference will be held in Manila in late August 2000. The findings of the workshops and\nconference will be compiled for dissemination within ADB, the participating DMCs, and the\ndonor community.  ADB staff will participate in the workshops and conference as resource\npersons to ensure that ADB\u2019s commitment to improving financial management and governance\nis adequately reflected.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n18. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$400,000 for the purpose of Strengthening Financial Management and Governance in Selected\nDeveloping Member Countries, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Project Targets Project Monitoring Assumptions and Risks\nMechanisms\nGoal\nTo improve financial management and governance in Strengthened financial Feedback from governments, Governments of selected DMCs\nselected developing member countries (DMCs). management capacity of executing agencies, and accept the findings of the study\naccounting and auditing professional bodies. and adopt proposed changes.\npractitioners for more efficient use\nof resources and greater\naccountability and transparency\namong institutions in different\nsectors.\nPurpose\n(\nR 1.
