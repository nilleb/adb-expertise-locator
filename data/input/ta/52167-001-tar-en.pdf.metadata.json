The governments of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Turkmenistan have each requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) financing support for phase 1 of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-\nPakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline (the \u201cproject\u201d).1 In addition, the Government of Turkmenistan \nhas requested ADB to provide a partial credit guarantee (PCG) in support to the project.2 The \npipeline will extend approximately 1,600 kilometers (km), from the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan \nborder to the Pakistan-India border. At full design capacity, the 56-inch TAPI pipeline can \ntransport up to 33 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas per year from Turkmenistan to \nAfghanistan, Pakistan, and India over a commercial operations period of 30 years. \n2.  The project comprises the design, procurement, installation and operation of the pipeline \nand related facilities (without compressor stations in Phase 1) within Afghanistan and Pakistan. \nConcurrently, State Concern <<Turkmengas>> (Turkmengaz) makes use of its own resources \n(including  financing  secured  from  the  Islamic  Development  Bank)  to  implement  within \nTurkmenistan: (i) the appropriation of a dedicated portion of the Galkynysh gas field; (ii) the \ninstallation of approximately 200 km of upstream pipeline connecting the Galkynysh gas field with \nthe project at the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan border; and (iii) the construction of one or more \ncompressor stations.3 Similarly, GAIL (India) Limited (GAIL) will use its resources to implement \nwithin India the installation of approximately 10 km of downstream pipeline connecting the project \nat the Pakistan-India border with GAIL\u2019s existing gas network terminus in Fazilka. Once phase 1 \nis completed, the Project is expected to transmit annually about one third (i.e. 11 bcm of gas) of \nthe TAPI pipeline\u2019s design capacity.4 \n3.  The estimated total Project cost (defined in paragraph 1) is $7.7 billion. The TAPI Pipeline \nCompany Limited (TPCL) has indicated that a debt-to-equity gearing ratio of 70/30 is likely to be \naccepted by potential financiers. On this basis, TPCL will have to raise up to $5.4 billion in debt \nfinancing. Besides export credit agency (ECA) - backed financing, TPCL may have to source \nsupplemental financing from other (commercial) financiers due to national content eligibility and \nrisk absorbing capacity or appetite constraints. For example, ECAs of member countries of the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development typically require 15% minimum down-\npayment for ECA-supported contracts to be sourced from TPCL\u2019s own means and/or other \n(commercial) financiers. \n4.  ADB is considering the provision of $300 million and $100 million in loans from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources (OCR) to Turkmenistan and Pakistan, respectively, as well as a $100 \nmillion grant to Afghanistan, out of which $70 million are sourced from the Asian Development \nFund (ADF) \u2013 special operations, and $30 million from yet to be determined donor co-financing  \n(collectively hereinafter referred to as \u201cADB Sovereign Financing\u201d). The proceeds of the ADB \nSovereign Financing will be made available to the Galkynysh Pipeline Company (GPC) (via \nTurkmengaz), with Afghan Gas Enterprise (AGE) and Inter State Gas Systems (Private) Limited \n(Pakistan) (ISGS) will partly fund their respective equity contributions to TPCL.5 Based on an \nestimated total project cost of $7.7 billion, Turkmengaz (via GPC) will have to provide an additional \n \n1 The Government of India, through GAIL (India) Limited (GAIL), will use its own resources to finance the India section \nof the TAPI pipeline. \n2 The TA related ensuing project is included in the country operational business plans (COBPs), 2020-2022  for \nTurkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan. \n3 The estimated cost of these upstream facilities in Turkmenistan amounts to approximately $10 billion. \n4 During phase 2, to be implemented after phase 1 is operational, six compressor stations would be constructed,  \n   so that the TAPI pipeline could then transmit its original design capacity of 33 bcm of gas per annum. \n5 Proceeds of ADB\u2019s financing support are to be used solely for the re-procured engineering, procurement and \nconstruction (EPC) contract for Afghanistan. \n ", "2   \n$1,675 million to contribute its remaining share in TPCL\u2019s equity. While AGE and ISGS will have \nto pay an additional $16 million each for their remaining equity stakes in TPCL, GAIL\u2019s overall \nequity contribution to TPCL amounts to $116 million. Equity contributions will probably be \ndisbursed concurrently to maintain shareholding percentages at all times. Specific details will be \ndetermined later in accordance with the negotiated financing structure and terms as equity \ncontributions may be made pro rata with debt or may need to be made upfront. No portion of the \nADB Sovereign Financing may be disbursed unless all amounts of equity and debt required for \nthe project have been fully committed and are available. \n5.  ADB is also considering the provision of a partial credit guarantee (PCG) covering up to \n$500 million in loan principal amounts payable under a commercial loan to the State Bank for \nForeign Economic Affairs of Turkmenistan (TVEB). Proceeds of such commercial loan of up to \n$617 million are to be on-lent by TVEB to TPCL and backed by a sovereign counter-guarantee \nand indemnity agreement (CGIA) entered into by ADB and the Republic of Turkmenistan.6 The \nPCG would help  mobilize commercial financing that may not otherwise be available for the \nproject. In order to achieve ADB\u2019s objective of obtaining leverage (lower ADB\u2019s guaranteed \npercentage), ADB will seek to supplement its cover with cover from third parties acceptable to \nproject lenders. The exact risk participation amounts by third parties will be determined through \nconsultations with the market. \n6.  The project is being prepared by the TPCL, an entity established and owned by the state \ngas companies of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India to develop, construct, own and \noperate the TAPI pipeline in Afghanistan and Pakistan. TPCL has (i) commissioned and received \na front-end engineering design (FEED) report, prepared largely on a desktop basis; and (ii) invited \nand received bids for the supply of the Project\u2019s pipeline and valves, and for engineering, \nprocurement and construction (EPC) contracts for constructing the pipeline in Afghanistan and \nPakistan. Given the issues identified by ADB in the procurement process conducted by TPCL to \ndate, TPCL has agreed to re-procure the EPC contract for the project sections in Afghanistan.  \nProceeds of ADB\u2019s financing instruments are to be applied solely to eligible expenditures under \nthe re-procured EPC contract for Afghanistan. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n7.  The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA)7 will undertake due diligence of the \nproject as prepared by TPCL to ensure that it complies in all necessary aspects to be suitable for \nADB financing.   \n \n8.  The TA, as described herein, is considered sufficient to undertake an acceptable level of \ndue diligence of the project at its present status, for the period up to approval of the ADB financing \nfor the project. However, since TPCL cannot provide detailed design for the project\u2019s EPC \ncontracts until they have been awarded and the contractors have completed the detailed design \nof the project, additional TA resources will be necessary in future. It is intended that these \nresources would be provided through another TA processed with the ADB financing of the project. \n \n6  PSOD\u2019s Guarantees and Syndication Unit will assist CWRD with the structuring, negotiation and execution of the \nPCG transaction, receiving formal recognition for its support in processing this PCG. Once executed, PSOD will also \nremain involved in the monitoring of the correct calculations and timely payment of the guarantee and commitment \nfees payable to ADB under the PCG, as well as in the handling of any potential demands made thereunder.  \n7  Upon approval of the TAPI project concept paper, the TA will be published in the business opportunities section in \nADB\u2019s website. \n ", "3 \nThis  additional  TA  would  also  provide  resources  for  the  ongoing  monitoring  of  TPCL\u2019s \nimplementation of the agreed safeguards activities throughout project construction. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  The principal activities under the proposed TA will be: (i) comprehensive technical due \ndiligence of the preliminary design and technical specifications of the project as presented in the \nFEED and included in the bidding documentation; (ii) comprehensive review of the economic and \nfinancial analyses prepared by TPCL for the project following ADB\u2019s standard requirements for \nsuch analyses; (iii) comprehensive review of the safeguards documentation prepared by TPCL \nfor the project to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) requirements; \nand (iv) assessment of financial management capabilities of TPCL following ADB\u2019s standard \nrequirements. \n \n10.  The outputs of the TA will be due diligence assessments of the technical, implementation, \neconomic, financial, legal8, environmental, social/resettlement, and other critical aspects of the \nProject, as inputs into ADB\u2019s processing of its proposed financing for the  project.  These \nassessments will include a gap analysis or similar review that identifies the deficiencies or risks \nin the Project\u2019s design and implementation arrangements, from ADB\u2019s perspective, and will \nsuggest how these deficiencies could be addressed and risks mitigated.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $2.15 million, of which (i) $600,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6);  (ii) $150,000 by ADB\u2019s TASF-other \nsources; and (iii) $1.4 million will be financed by the existing TAPI deferred revenue account \n(DRA).9 The DRA is part of OCR and can be used by recognizing it as \u201cRevenue\u201d in OCR with a \ncorresponding \u201cExpense\u201d for each eligible cost item (e.g. consultant fees) incurred in relation to \nthe TA contracts. The DRA funds will be used first before using TASF. The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 1. \n12.  The  governments  of  Turkmenistan,  Afghanistan,  and  Pakistan  will  provide  required \ndocumentation and counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, \nand  other  in-kind  contributions.  TPCL  will  provide  reports,  designs  and  documentation  as \nrequired, in addition to counterpart staff and office accommodation. The governments and TPCL \nhave been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB  will  administer the  TA.  The  Energy  Division  of  ADB\u2019s  Central  and  West  Asia \nDepartment will select, supervise, and evaluate the consultants. \n14.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 1.  \n \n \n8  Legal due diligence will be on the basis of reliance on the due diligence conducted for lenders and that exercise is \nyet to commence. \n9  The TAPI DRA holds the balance of retainer fees earned by ADB under the 2013-2016 TAS mandate and is \nspecifically earmarked to finance a portion of the consulting services under ADB\u2019s TA contracts. \n ", "4   \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements\n \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative  implementation  May 2020 \u2013 Apr 202210  \nperiod \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agency  ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nFirm and/or Individual  International:  $  2.15 million \nconsultant selection  54 person-months \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n ADB = Asian Development Bank, TA = technical assistance.  \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n15.

The  TA  will  require \napproximately 54 person-months of international consultants, as summarized in Table 2 below.11 \n16.  The consultants will be recruited as firms and/or individuals. This approach is dictated by \nthe wide range of expertise required, the necessity to mobilize the consultants with minimum \ndelay, and the uncertainty as to when TPCL and other stakeholders will provide technical, \nsafeguards, and other requisite information to be verified and assessed, and the quality of that \ninformation when it has been provided. \nTable 2: Summary of Consultants\u2019 Required Inputs \n  International Positions  Person-Months \n1.
