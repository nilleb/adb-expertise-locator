The  Government  of  Mongolia  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare the Third Financial Sector Program (FSP III) loan, to further \nthe reforms implemented under the Financial Sector Program (FSP) loan and the Second \nFinancial Sector Program (FSP II) loan. This program preparatory technical assistance (TA) is \nincluded  in  the  Mongolia  Country  Strategy  and  Program  Update  for  2004\u20132006,  and  is \nprogrammed for 2004. The ensuing loan is programmed for 2005. Fact-finding for the TA was \nundertaken in December 2002, and in February and September 2003.1 Agreement with the \nGovernment on the TA objectives, scope, and implementation arrangements was reached in \nSeptember 2003.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Mongolia began a comprehensive reform program in 1991, with the goal of transforming \nthe  centrally  planned  economy  into  a  market-based system. Despite challenges posed by \neconomic and political vulnerabilities, the Government launched the first phase of financial \nsector  reforms  in  1996,  supported  by  ADB's  Financial  Sector  Program  (FSP)2 loan. The \nobjective of the FSP, implemented during 1996-1999, was to lay the foundation for a sound and \nmarket-oriented financial sector. FSP reform focused on (i) establishing a legal and regulatory \nframework for the banking sector consistent with international standards, (ii) restructuring the \nbanking system to strengthen viable banks and to close those that were insolvent, (iii) reducing \ngovernment involvement while encouraging market orientation and commercialization of the \nbanking system, and (iv) developing capacities to improve bank credit and risk management \nand banking supervision.  \n \n3.  Considerable progress was made under the FSP in terms of liberalizing banking policies, \nstrengthening bank regulations, and restoring health of viable banks while closing insolvent \nones. However, the financial sector remained weak, lacked diversity, and played a limited role in \nthe economy. In 1999 the Government formulated the second phase of reforms\u2014the Financial \nSector Reform Program (FSRP)  \u2014supported by FSP II loan,3 and World Bank\u2019s Financial \nSector Adjustment Credit (FSAC). The FSAC focused on the banking sector, and FSP II on \nselected banking sector reform measures and overall financial sector development. In particular, \nFSP II has supported (i) the strengthening of corporate governance in banks, (ii) improved loan \ncollateral, (iii) the introduction of an interbank market, (iv) institutional strengthening of the \nMongolia Stock Exchange Commission (MSEC), and (v) the development of legal infrastructure \nfor nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs). \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on December 2002. \n2  ADB. 1996.  Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on Proposed Loans and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to Mongolia for the Financial Sector Program. Manila (Loan 1509-MON, approved on \n19 December 1996 for $35 million, along with Loan 1510-MON: Upgrading Skills and Systems of Commercial \nBanks for $3 million, and TA 2720-MON: Strengthening the Supervisory and Restructuring Capacity of the Bank of \nMongolia for $1 million). \n3  ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loans and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to Mongolia for the Second Financial Sector Program. Manila (Loan 1743-MON, \napproved on 22 June 2000 for $15 million, along with TA 3459-MON: Strengthening Financial Sector Development, \nfor $600,000). ", "2 \n4.  Need  for  Further  Development  of  Nonbank  Financial  Institutions.4  FSP II has \nprovided the platform for further improvement of financial intermediation and sector stability. Led \nby banking sector growth, the level of financial intermediation has increased in recent years. \nThe ratio of broad money (M2) to Gross Domestic Product (GDP), an indicator of financial \nintermediation,  grew  from  22%  in  1999  to  38%  in  2002.  At  the  same  time,  the  ratio  of \nnonperforming loans has remained relatively stable at around 7\u20138%, down from a high of 55% \nin 1999. However, the nonbank financial sector (NBFS) remains small and does not yet play a \nmeaningful role in mobilizing savings for medium- and long-term investments. Private sector \ndevelopment is largely financed by retained earnings and bank borrowings. While the number of \nlisted companies has grown in recent years, the securities market remains underdeveloped in \nliquidity and market capitalization, and as a source of equity capital and debt financing for the \nprivate sector. At MNT52 billion, total market capitalization is less than 5% of GDP. Of the 403 \ncompanies listed on the Mongolia Stock Exchange at the end of 2002, only 30 had actively \ntraded shares. Government bond (treasury bill) maturities are as short as bank term deposits, \nand the corporate \u201cbond\u201d market is limited to discount schemes for pre-construction apartment \nsales. Other sources of long-term funds are also limited. Only one company is licensed to \nprovide leasing services, and mortgage lending is limited mainly to pre-construction schemes for \nnew housing in Ulan Bataar.   \n \n5.  While there are 16 insurance companies in Mongolia, the sector is dominated by one \ncompany, and is heavily concentrated in the automobile and shipping industries. In 2002 total \ninsurance  premium  amounted  to  approximately  0.5%  of  GDP.  The  pension  fund  is  a \ngovernment-budget  supported,  pay-as-you-go  system  that  is  open  to  private  company \nemployees. The fund is severely underfinanced due to large contribution arrears and the narrow \nbase of pension contributions relative to the coverage of pension recipients. In view of the \nimportant role of institutional investors in catalyzing capital market development, insurance and \npension fund development should be an integral part of the medium-term financial development \nstrategy. As such, there is a need to further develop NBFIs to create a more dynamic and \ncompetitive  financial  sector  that  offers  a  range  of  funding  sources  to  businesses,  and  to \nconsumers of financial services, including investors and policyholders, through consumer credit, \ntrust services, and contractual savings in the form of voluntary private pension schemes. \n \n6.  Regulation,  Governance,  and  Supervision  of  Nonbank  Financial  Institutions. \nRegulation and supervision of NBFIs is fragmented and has yet to meet international norms of \nbest practice. As of April 2003, 72 companies were licensed as NBFIs and regulated by the \nBank of Mongolia (BoM). The capital market is regulated by MSEC, which does not have the \ncapacity to effectively carry out its functions as stipulated under the Law on Securities Markets \nenacted  in  December  2002.  While  the  draft  law  on  insurance  prepared  under  FSP  II \nincorporates solvency and prudential requirements in line with international standards, further \nassistance is required to develop the regulatory framework and to ensure compliance. The \nInsurance Supervisory Agency employs only five professional staff, none with prior insurance \nindustry experience. The General Department of National Taxation supervises the savings and \ncredit cooperatives.5 The department collects basic tax-related data from the cooperatives but \ndoes not have the skills and resources to regulate them. Capacity constraints of individual \n                                                 \n4  In Mongolia, the term nonbank financial institution refers to a licensee under the Law on Nonbank Financial \nActivities, which regulates 10 specific financial sector activities. In this paper, NBFIs are defined as all financial \ninstitutions except commercial banks, including finance and leasing companies, savings and credit cooperatives, \ninsurance companies, pension funds, and the securities market \n5    While the approximately 400 active cooperatives are small in absolute terms and relative to  the banking sector (as \n    of  June  2003  their  total  loans  outstanding  were  roughly  3.6%  of  loan  outstanding by commercial banks, and \n    deposits reached 2.1% of bank deposits) growth is rapid. ", "    3 \nregulatory  agencies,  and  small  size  of  the  financial  sector  provide  a  strong  rationale  for \nconsolidating regulation and supervision of NBFIs, possibly in the form of a unified nonbank \nfinancial services authority (NBFSA). \n \n7.  ADB Strategy and Operations. Financial sector development has long been a strategic \nfocus of ADB assistance to Mongolia. ADB has provided continued assistance to promote the \ndevelopment of a sound financial sector since the mid-1990s. While much has already been \nachieved, it is important that the momentum for reforms is sustained through continued support \nto develop a broad-based financial sector. ADB has coordinated closely with Mongolia\u2019s other \ndevelopment partners. The Government\u2019s comprehensive FSRP is jointly supported by FSP II \nand World Bank\u2019s FSAC. World Bank activities include support for strengthening the bank \nregulatory framework and risk management, and for amendment of the civil code to improve the \nlegal process for asset foreclosure by banks. Under its Policy Support Project, the United States \nAgency for International Development (USAID) is helping strengthen the management team of \nAgricultural Bank, the bank with the largest rural coverage. A number of projects, including \nthose  supported  by  World  Bank,  the  UK  Government\u2019s  Department  for  International \nDevelopment  (DFID),  European  Union-Technical  Assistance  for  the  Commonwealth  of \nIndependent  States  (EU-TACIS),  and  Canadian  Cooperative  Association,  are  aimed  at \nimproving  access  to  credit  and  financial  services,  particularly  for  rural  and  vulnerable \npopulations. Given the relevance of these projects, ADB will continue to coordinate with other \ndonor agencies. \n  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  Building on the reforms implemented under FSP and FSP II, this TA will help the \nGovernment formulate and design a program to promote the sound and orderly development of \nNBFIs. To this end, the TA will focus on strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework \nfor NBFIs and addressing remaining impediments to the development of the sector. Outputs will \ninclude (i) a long-term strategy to regulate and develop NBFIs; (ii) governance, regulatory, and \nsupervisory standards for NBFIs in line with international standards, and further development of \nNBFIs;  (iii)  improved  efficiency  of  the  NBFI  regulatory  and  supervisory  framework  by \nharmonizing regulatory and supervisory practices, possibly in the form of NBFSA; and (iv) a \nmedium-term road map for the development of NBFIs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities   \n9.  The TA will undertake the following: \n  \n1.  Develop a Long-term Strategy for the Regulation and Development of the \nNonbank Financial Institutions \n10.  This activity will entail the following:  \n \n(i)  Review  the  development  stage  of  banks  and  NBFIs  to  develop  a  broad \nperspective on the financial sector as a whole. Assess the medium- to long-term \npotential for development of the individual subsectors of the NBFS. \n \n(ii)  Review  the  scope,  functions,  and  institutional  arrangements  of  financial \nregulators. ", "4 \n(iii)  Based on (i) and (ii), and incorporating the evolving interlinkages between banks \nand NBFIs, develop a perspective of a long-term strategy to develop NBFIs, with \na primary focus on identifying a cost-effective and viable regulatory framework. \n \n2.  Strengthen  Governance,  Regulatory,  and  Supervisory  Standards  for \nNonbank Financial Institutions, and Other Measures  \n11.  This activity will entail the following: \n \n(i)  Improve licensing, financial reporting, and fiduciary standards; improve corporate \ngovernance  of  NBFIs;  and  strengthen  governance  and  oversight  of  self-\nregulatory organizations such as the stock exchange and others (associations of \nintermediaries  or  market  professionals)  that  might  perform  self-regulatory \nfunctions. \n \n(ii)  Harmonize  prudential  and  regulatory  standards  to  reduce  opportunities  for \nregulatory arbitrage and conflicts of interest inherent in related-party transactions.  \n \n(iii)  Review tax treatment of financial services and related corporate ni come, and \nrecommend measures to address tax-related distortions.  \n \n(iv)  Make specific recommendations for expanding the range of financial instruments \navailable  for  investment,  bond  and  equity  markets,  collective  investment \nschemes, and private pension funds. \n \n(v)  Recommend policy actions and regulatory reforms to develop NBFIs.  \n \n3.  Harmonize Regulatory and Supervisory Practices of Nonbank Financial \nInstitutions \n12.  This activity will entail the following: \n \n(i)  Create  a  regulatory  council  or  high-level  working  group  to  implement  a \nmemorandum  of  understanding  among  financial  regulators  to  facilitate  the \nharmonization of regulatory and supervisory practices with respect to banks and \nNBFIs. \n \n(ii)  Explore the feasibility of, and potential benefits from, creating a unified NBFI \nregulator in light of the existing regulatory framework and long-term development \ngoals for the sector.  \n \n(iii)  Streamline the financial and operational regulatory reporting system, and develop \nan  integrated  on-site  and  off-site  supervision  program  for  nonbank  financial \nsubsidiaries or affiliates of commercial banks, and for nonbank financial services \ngroups. \n \n(iv)  Prepare  guidelines  for  NBFIs  and  self-regulatory  organizations  to  facilitate \nregulatory compliance and reporting requirements of financial regulators. \n ", "    5 \n(v)  Develop an Information Technology-Management Information System (IT-MIS) \nstrategy, with recommended systems and software to be employed under the \nharmonized regulatory framework/NBFSA. \n \n4.  Develop Medium-Term Reform Agenda for the Nonbank Financial Sector \n \n13.  This activity will entail formulating a reform agenda, with specific recommendations, \nconditions, and benchmarks to guide sector reform in 2004\u20132007.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total TA cost is estimated at $589,000 equivalent, comprising $451,000 in foreign \ncurrency and $138,000 equivalent in local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, and will cover the entire \nforeign exchange cost of $451,000, and $49,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. The \nGovernment will finance the remaining local currency costs of $89,000 equivalent by providing \ncounterpart staff, domestic transportation, workshop facilities, and office and logistical support. \nDetailed cost estimates are in Appendix 1.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.   The TA will be implemented over a period of 8 months, commencing February 2004. The \nTA will require 12 person-months of international, and 12 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices. The international consultants will include a financial services regulatory and policy \nexpert (5 person-months), a regulatory expert on pension plans (2 person-months), a legal and \nenforcement expert (3 person-months), and an IT-MIS expert (2 person-months).
