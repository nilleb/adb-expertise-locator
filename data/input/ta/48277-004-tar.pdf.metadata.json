INTRODUCTION \n1.  With  the  demand  for  electricity  doubling  every  7  years  and  the  country\u2019s \noverdependence on dwindling reserves of domestic natural gas, the Government of Bangladesh \nrequested Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance in April 2014 to conduct a study on \nenergy security in the country and to provide recommendations on diversifying the fuels it uses \nto  generate  electricity.  This  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  project  will \nundertake this study on the energy security issues facing Bangladesh, recommend priority \npower generation projects, and conduct feasibility studies on these projects. The outline of the \nTA, with emphasis on its impact, outcome, outputs, activities, implementing arrangements, cost \nand  financing,  and  terms  of  reference  for  consultants,  was  discussed  with  the  relevant \ngovernment agencies during ADB reconnaissance and fact-finding missions.1 The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The energy sector in Bangladesh is characterized by an acute shortage of electricity \ngenerating capacity. Meanwhile, demand is increasing for power to serve the growing economy \nand to provide the essential needs of the segment of the population that is not connected to grid \nelectricity. The national grid of Bangladesh generally covers the entire country. The only major \nelectricity grid interconnection to neighboring countries is the 500-megawatt interconnection with \nIndia established in 2013 with ADB assistance.2 In 2013, only 62% of the people in Bangladesh \nhad access to electricity, and the country\u2019s annual per capita electricity consumption of 321 \nkilowatt-hours was the second-lowest in South Asia. A major challenge is to provide modern \nenergy services to the remaining section of the population that lacks access to such services. \nThis  requires  additional  investments  in  electricity  generating  capacity  as  well  as  in  the \ntransmission and distribution networks.   \n \n3.  Domestically sourced natural gas has played a key role in providing the country\u2019s energy \nneeds and accounted for 66% of the primary commercial energy supply in 2013. Gas has been \neven  more  dominant  in  the  power  sector.  In  2013,  78%  of  the  country\u2019s  electricity  was \ngenerated by gas-fired power stations, which consumed more than one-half of total domestic \ngas production. However, growth in the country\u2019s gas production has not kept up with the \nincreasing demand for power generation purposes and from other gas-intensive industries, such \nas fertilizer production. As a result of the supply shortfall, existing gas-fired power stations are \nnot operating at the full capacity. This makes the use of gas to power the additional new \nelectricity generation the country urgently needs problematic. Bangladesh\u2019s useable onshore \ngas reserves are shrinking, and only an estimated 12 trillion cubic feet remain. That is only \nenough to meet about 10 years of projected consumption. In addition, off-shore gas exploration \nhas made extremely slow progress, largely because of delays in the resolution of disputes with \nthe neighboring countries on the ownership of off-shore exploration blocks. The other main \ncommercial energy source is oil, which is largely imported. Bangladesh has an estimated 2.7 \nbillion  tons  of  largely  untapped  coal  reserves,  but  exploiting  these  would  present  its  own \nchallenges in this very densely populated country, particularly in the area of safeguards. These \nenergy sector issues were highlighted in a 2009 ADB evaluation of its energy sector program in \nBangladesh.3 \n \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 November 2014. \n2  ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for the Bangladesh\u2013India Electrical Grid Interconnection Project. Manila. \n3  ADB. 2009. Sector Assistance Program Evaluation: Energy Sector in Bangladesh. Manila. \n ", "2   \n4.  The heavy reliance on domestic natural gas to produce electricity has created a major \nbottleneck in government plans and efforts to add generation capacity to meet the current and \nfuture demand for power and provide electricity to the many citizens who now must do without it. \nInadequate gas supplies meant that the country\u2019s 10,416 megawatts of generation capacity \nwere not fully used in 2014. A 2004 estimate put the economic losses in the industrial sector \nbecause of power outages at 1.7% of gross domestic product.4 These factors point to the \npressing need to diversify the fuels used to generate the country\u2019s power, provide a more \nreliable supply of electricity, and strengthen energy security.  Some progress has been made by \nestablishing an ADB-financed grid interconnection between Bangladesh and India in 2013 and \nincreasing  the  country\u2019s  oil-fueled  generation  capacity.5 The  government  adopted  a  fuel \ndiversification policy in 2010 that recommends primary energy sources for generating electricity, \nsuch as nuclear power, coal, and imported liquefied natural gas. Studies have shown that \nreplacing gas with coal as a primary fuel in the power sector and allocating more gas to other \nsectors will bring economic benefits to the country. However, a systematic study is needed on \nfuel diversification and the related energy security issues to help the government plan the \ncountry\u2019s energy future. Such a study needs to consider the options for primary fuels in power \ngeneration as well as both intraregional and interregional power trade options, including power \nimports from Myanmar and Nepal through India and contributions of renewable energy sources \nsuch as wind and solar power.    \n \n5.  Other energy issues confronting Bangladesh include inefficient allocation of gas among \nsectors, such as power, transport, and fertilizer. Financial sustainability in the energy sector is \npoor, mainly because large government subsidies lead to underpricing of gas and electricity. An \nADB financed study has estimated that pricing of gas in line with prices in India and Pakistan \nwould have increased annual gas revenues from $300 million to $2.9 billion in 2011.6  Such a \nprice increase would have encouraged the efficient use of gas, while the additional revenues \ncould have helped reduce government subsidies in the energy sector. Both electricity and gas \npricing are within the purview of the Bangladesh Energy Regulatory Commission. However, the \ncommission\u2019s  independence  and  competence  have  not  yet  been  fully  proven,  and  some \ngovernment interference has been experienced in the past. The commission has also suffered \nfrom a lack of internal capacity. ADB and other development partners address these policy, \nregulatory, and institutional issues during their policy dialogue with the government. \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact will be enhanced primary fuel diversification in Bangladesh\u2019s power sector. \nThe outcome will be the increased capacity of the Power Division of the Ministry of Power, \nEnergy, and Mineral Resources to diversify fuel sources for power generation. \n \n                                                \n4  P.D.C.

The TA  will  deliver  two  outputs:  (i)  understanding  of the  overall  security  of  energy \nsupplies in Bangladesh improved, and (ii) feasibility of the most attractive baseload generation \noptions confirmed with specific case studies provided. These two outputs will be achieved \nthrough the following key activities: \n \n(i)  Reviewing literature on energy options for Bangladesh (with emphasis on the \npower sector), paying particular attention to the lessons learned in using these \nenergy options in both developing and developed countries, especially in the \nSouth Asia region; \n(ii)  Comparing and contrasting these options for baseload power generation, fully \nconsidering such factors as the availability of energy sources domestically and \ninternationally;  the  cost  of  exploitation  and  transportation  and  whether \nuninterrupted supplies can be ensured; and the economic, social, gender, and \nenvironmental impacts of using each of them as a primary fuel supply in power \ngeneration; \n(iii)  Critically examining the other barriers to the development of the power sector, \nsuch as inefficient operation and management of the country\u2019s power utilities and \nthe lack of financial sustainability in the energy sector, which is an obstacle to \npower sector development; \n(iv)  Consulting fully with different stakeholders to obtain their views on whether these \noptions are reasonable solutions to the energy supply security issues in the \ncountry; \n(v)  Ranking the options after giving due attention to all the factors considered in the \ncomparative analysis of the options and to the opinions expressed during the \nstakeholder consultations; \n(vi)  Identifying specific projects based on the most highly ranked options; and \n(vii)  Conducting due diligence on these projects, with emphasis on techno-economic \nfeasibility, financial viability, environmental and social safeguards, gender issues \nand safeguards, and financial sustainability. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n8.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n9.  The  executing  agency  will  be  the  Bangladesh  Power  Development  Board  (BPDB), \noperating under the overall supervision of the Power Division of the Ministry of Power, Energy, \nand Mineral Resources. The BPDB will facilitate access by the TA consultants to available data \nand documents related to the country\u2019s energy sector and liaise between the consultants and \nthe government institutions relevant to the TA activities. ADB will administer all the contracts \nunder the TA. \n \n10.  The  TA  will  require  34  person-months  of  international  consultant  services  and  40 \nperson-months of services from national consultants. Expertise will be engaged in the areas of \nenergy  sector  policy;  power  sector  planning;  mechanical,  electrical,  and  civil  engineering; \n ", "4   \nproject  economic  and  financial  analyses;  financial  management;  environment  and  social \nsafeguards; and poverty and gender. ADB will recruit a consulting firm and some individual \nconsultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). Because the contract budget is less than $1,000,000, simplified technical \nproposals  will  be  requested  from  short-listed  firms,  where  applicable.  The  recruitment  of \nconsultants will be carried out using quality- and cost-based criteria, with a quality\u2013cost ratio of \n90:10.  Procurement  of  goods  will  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  To  the  extent  possible,  payment  for \nconsultancy services will be based on the achievement of milestones. All disbursements under \nthe TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). The consultancy deliverables will be the reports on the \noverall energy security study and  on the subsequent feasibility studies of specific projects \nidentified by the overall study. Goods procured under the TA will be handed over to the BPDB \non completion of the TA project. \n \n11.  The TA project is expected to be implemented from January 2015 to December 2017. \nProgress will be monitored through inception, interim, draft final, and final reports on the study. \nA senior advisor appointed under the TA will continuously monitor and guide the consulting \nteam during implementation. At least two stakeholder meetings will be held to validate the \napproach of the study and the final findings. These meetings, a final dissemination seminar, and \nan ADB publication will be used to deliver the findings of the study to the key stakeholders. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n12.
