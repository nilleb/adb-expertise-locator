During the 2012 country programming mission, the Government of the People\u2019s Republic \nof  China  (PRC)  requested  capacity  development  technical  assistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank (ADB)  to  strengthen capacity for  wetland  protection for  Sanjiang  Plain.1                \nIn August 2013, an ADB fact-finding mission visited the PRC and reached an understanding with \nthe  government  on  the  TA\u2019s  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and consultants\u2019 terms of reference. The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Sanjiang Plain is a vast alluvial floodplain of 108,900 square kilometers in the northeast of \nHeilongjiang Province, where the Heilong, Songhua, and Wusuli rivers join. The plain, one of the \nPRC\u2019s richest areas in globally significant flora and fauna, supports about 40 ecosystems; 1,000 \nspecies  of  plants;  and  530  species  of  vertebrate  fauna,  including  more  than  20  globally \nthreatened species on the World Conservation Union Red List. The globally threatened species \ninclude waterfowl such as cranes, storks, and swan geese, which require extensive, undisturbed \nwetlands during their migration and breeding seasons. The Sanjiang Plain  wetlands are an \nimportant nesting and stopover location at the northern end of the East Asian\u2014Australian flyway \nfor migratory waterfowl, most notably white-naped and red-crowned cranes. \n \n3.  However, the wetlands have shrunk to one-fifth of their original size in the last 5 decades \nbecause  of  increasing  population,  grain  production,  and  exploitation  of  biological  and  water \nresources. Accelerating population growth and increasing grain production threaten the flora and \nfauna. Local communities exploit biological and water resources within the wetlands for their \nlivelihood  through  unsustainable  farming  practices.  The  limited  management  capacity  of \nprovincial and local government staff has exacerbated the deterioration of wetland resources. \n \n4.  The PRC government has adopted several important national policies and legal measures \nto guide and direct habitat restoration and biodiversity conservation. The Wild Animal Protection \nLaw of 1988 has reduced the overexploitation of wildlife from hunting and egg collecting. In 1993, \nthe PRC ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity; and in 1994, it issued the Biodiversity \nConservation  Action  Plan  and  the  Nature  Reserve  Protection  Regulation.  In  1996,  the \nHeilongjiang provincial government (HPG) issued the Regulation of Nature Reserves establishing \npriority wetland nature reserves;2 and in 1998, the Decision on Wetland Conservation suspending \nfurther conversion of wetlands to farmland.3 In 2002, the National Wetland Conservation Action \nPlan  was  approved,  outlining  priority  actions  to  guide  conservation,  use,  management,  and \ninstitutional frameworks. The plan was reinforced a year later with the issuance by HPG of one of \nthe PRC\u2019s first wetland regulations, the Regulations on Wetland Conservation of Heilongjiang \nProvince. The protected wetland area of Sanjiang Plain currently includes 24 nature reserves, \nwhich cover 11,675 square kilometers or 10.7% of the plain. Despite the impressive legal steps, \nwetland  restoration  and  protection  are  still  new  concepts  in  the  PRC.  Wetland  restoration \nprograms  have  been  planned,  but  sound  wetland  management  expertise  and  scientific \nknowledge are scarce. \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 August 2013.   \n2  Nature reserves are specially designated areas protected by the PRC\u2019s Nature Reserve Protection Regulation to \nconserve wetland habitats.  \n3  Heilongjiang Party Committee. 1998. Document No. 21. Harbin. \n ", "2   \n5.  Since wetland management expertise and scientific knowledge needed to be developed to \nreverse the continuing trend toward reduction and degradation of the Sanjiang Plain wetlands and \nprotect wetland-dependent wildlife species, an ADB loan for $15 million cofinanced by a Global \nEnvironment Facility grant of $12.14 million for the Sanjiang Plain Wetlands Protection Project \nwas approved in 2005. The project comprised five components: (i) watershed management, (ii) \nwetland  nature  reserve management, (iii)  alternative  livelihood  programs, (iv)  education  and \ncapacity building, and (v) project management. The HPG was the executing agency. \n \n6.  Under the project, various pilot wetland protection activities were conducted in six model \nnature  reserves:  Angbanhe,  Dajiahe,  Naolihe,  Qixinghe,  Xingkaihu,  and  Zhenbaodao.  The \nRamsar Convention Bureau listed Xingkaihu as a wetland of international importance in 2002 \nbefore the project commenced; Qinghe and Zhenbaodao were listed in 2011 during  project \nimplementation.  Lessons  during  project  implementation  were  introduced  in  ADB  reviews  on \nreviving lakes and wetlands.4 \n \n7.  The project was completed successfully in August 2012. In the six model reserves, pilot \nactivities were successfully conducted, including watershed management, wetland restoration, \nwildlife  species  recovery,  reduction  of  resource  exploitation,  and  alternative  livelihoods \ndevelopment. Eight key globally threatened species in Sanjiang Plain were monitored during \nproject implementation; this is ongoing.5  \n \n8.  To expand these successes under the Sanjiang Plain Wetlands Protection Project to other \nnature reserves through capacity development, dissemination of the wetland protection models \ndeveloped under the project, and sharing of knowledge accumulated under the project, including \nproviding information useful for considering future investment projects, the HPG requested ADB\u2019s \ncontinuous support through this TA. \n \n9.  The PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 supports the long-term goal of building a \nharmonious and moderately prosperous society through livelihood improvement, with regionally \nbalanced and environmentally sustainable growth. ADB has been supporting projects on lakes \nand wetland protection in the PRC. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC \nsupports the government\u2019s overarching strategic goal of building a harmonious and moderately \nprosperous  society  by  focusing  on  three  strategic  pillars:  inclusive  growth,  environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional cooperation and integration. The TA is fully consistent with the \nPRC\u2019s  plan  and  the  country  partnership  strategy  by  promoting  sustainable  management  of \nnatural resources and protecting globally significant biodiversity in Sanjiang Plain. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The  impact  will  be  improved  management  of  natural  resources  to  protect  globally \nsignificant biodiversity in Sanjiang Plain. The outcome will be capacity established for continued \nimplementation and expansion of achievements of the Sanjiang Plain Wetlands Protection Project. \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2008. Reviving Lakes and Wetlands: Lessons Learned from the People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n5  The eight key globally threatened species are Baikal teal, hooded crane, lesser white-fronted goose, scaly-sided \nmerganser, oriental stork, red-crowned crane, swan goose, and white-naped crane. As of 31 October 2013, scaly-\nsided merganser, oriental stork, and red-crowned crane are on the list of endangered species; and hooded crane, \nlesser white-fronted goose, swan goose, and white-naped crane are on the list of vulnerable species. Baikal teal was \nmoved from the list of endangered to vulnerable species. ", "  3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA outputs will be (i) expansion of relevant HPG staff capacity for wetland protection \ndeveloped  under  the  Sanjiang  Plain  Wetlands  Protection  Project;  and  (ii)  expansion  and \ndissemination  of  wetland  protection  models  developed  under  the  Sanjiang  Plain  Wetlands \nProtection Project and sharing of knowledge developed or accumulated for Sanjiang Plain. The \nTA will be implemented over 13 months. From TA commencement to the end of the first month, \nconsultants will (i) review past and ongoing wetland protection activities for Sanjiang Plain and \nother wetlands in the PRC; and identify achievements and remaining challenges, particularly \nthose under the project; (ii) assess HPG, local government, and nature reserve staff capacity for \nwetland  protection,  and  identify  training  needs;  (iii)  prepare  a  training  program  for  decision \nmakers and nature reserve staff; and (iv) prepare an outline of a knowledge product on wetland \nprotection. \n \n12.  From the beginning of the second month to the end of the fifth month, the consultants will \ndraft the knowledge product to supplement ADB reviews on reviving lakes and wetlands (footnote \n4). It will include sections for watershed management (particularly forest improvement), wetland \nrestoration,  wildlife  species  recovery,  reduction  of  resource  exploitation,  and  alternative \nlivelihoods (particularly ecotourism and water- and land-intensive eco-greenhouse agriculture) \nincluding achievements, suggested revisions to the achievements, remaining challenges, lessons \nfrom  the  Sanjiang  Plain Wetlands  Protection  Project,  and  key  messages  for  future  wetland \nprotection. Two workshops will be held at the beginning and end of this period for consultation on \nthe knowledge product. The draft knowledge product will be discussed by decision makers and \nnature reserve staff through training courses. The consultants will revise the knowledge product \nincorporating  comments  from  ADB,  HPG,  local  governments,  nature  reserves,  and  other \nspecialists. From the beginning of the 6th month to the end of the 10th month, the knowledge \nproduct will be edited, formatted, and printed by ADB. It will be launched at an international \nworkshop during the 11th month. \n \n13.  From the beginning of the 2nd month to the end of the 10th month, the consultants will \nprovide decision makers and nature reserve staff with training. At least one training course will be \nprovided to decision makers, including mayors of cities and counties where important wetlands \nexist; and key senior officers of the HPG to raise their awareness of the importance of wetland \nprotection.  At  least  one  training  course  will  be  provided  to  nature  reserve  staff  on  \n(i) wetland restoration, (ii) recovery of wildlife species and reduction of resource exploitation,  \n(iii) monitoring of wildlife species, and (iv) development of alternative livelihoods. During this \nperiod, the consultants will assist HPG, local government, and nature reserve staff in continuously \nimplementing and expanding the project achievements for wetland restoration, wildlife species \nrecovery, reduction of resource exploitation, and monitoring of wildlife species. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $625,000, of which $200,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources); and $300,000 equivalent will \nbe  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the  Multi-Donor  Trust  Fund  under  the  Water  Financing \nPartnership Facility and administered by ADB. Funding from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund will be \nused to produce the knowledge product.6 \n \n                                                \n6  Contributors: the governments of Australia, Austria, Norway, Spain, and Switzerland. \n ", "4   \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation; \ndomestic  transportation,  remuneration,  per  diem  for  counterpart  staff,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The HPG will be the executing agency. The Heilongjiang Provincial Forestry Department \n(HPFD)  will  be  the  implementing  agency.  The  HPG,  particularly  HPFD,  is  responsible  for \nprotecting wetlands through Heilongjiang Province; and has shown strong capacity to execute the \nproject. \n \n17.  A TA management office (TMO) will be established at HPFD to administer the day-to-day \nTA activities and coordinate with ADB. HPFD will assign an experienced full-time staff member to \nserve as TMO director and counterpart staff to work closely with the TA consultants. It will provide \noffice space, access to communications and copiers, and logistical support for TA implementation. \nThe TMO director will manage and liquidate funds provided by ADB for training, seminars, and \nconferences. \n \n18.  A steering committee will be established under the HPG to guide TA implementation. The \ncommittee  members  will  be  senior  representatives  of  the  HPG,  including  the  Heilongjiang \nProvincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  the  Heilongjiang  Provincial  Finance \nDepartment, and HPFD. The steering committee will meet at the inception, interim, midterm, and \nfinal stages of TA implementation; and when important TA outputs are produced. \n \n19.  Consultant recruitment will be conducted from January to April 2014. The TA will be \nimplemented from 12 May 2014 to 11 June 2015 (tentative). The consultants will submit an \ninception report within a month after TA commencement, a draft knowledge product within 4 \nmonths after TA commencement, and interim report within 5 months after TA commencement. A \ndraft final report will be submitted within 11 months after TA commencement, and a final report at \nTA  conclusion. The  inception,  interim,  and  draft final  reports,  including the  draft  knowledge \nproduct will be subject to review by ADB and the HPG. All reports and the draft knowledge \nproduct will be written in English and translated into Chinese. Three copies of each of the reports \nand draft knowledge product will be submitted to ADB in English, and five copies in both English \nand Chinese will be submitted to the HPG. In addition, soft copies of the draft knowledge product \nwill be submitted to ADB in a format suitable for editing and publication. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The TA will be carried out by a team of consultants engaged through a firm, providing 8.5 \nperson-months of international and 16.0 person-months of national consulting services. ADB will \nengage the consultants following the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). The consulting firm will be selected using simplified technical proposals and \nquality- and cost-based selection with a quality\u2013cost ratio of 80:20. Equipment for TA consultants \nwill be procured following ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time), \nand handed over to the HPG upon TA completion. Disbursement under the TA will be in line with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nAdvance payment facilities will be established to facilitate timely TA implementation. ADB funds \nfor training, seminars, and conferences will be transferred to an existing HPG bank account, and \nmanaged  and  liquidated  by  the  TMO  director.  ADB  will  undertake  intensive  review  and \nsupervision by fielding missions at critical stages of TA implementation\u2014particularly inception, \nmidterm, and final; and by extending regular support from ADB headquarters and the PRC \nResident Mission.
