During  the  2007  Country  Operations  Business  Plan  Mission  for  2008\u20132010,  the \nGovernment of Tajikistan (the Government) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  for  the  preparation  of  the  Central  Asia  Regional  Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) Transport Corridor III (Dushanbe\u2013Uzbekistan Border Road) Project. The \nTA Fact-Finding Mission visited Tajikistan on 8\u201311 February 2008 and reached understanding \nwith the Government on the impact, outcome, outputs, costs, financing and implementation \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.1 The TA design and monitoring framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Inherent Regional Challenges in the Transport Sector. Central Asia is landlocked. \nThe  demise  of  the  former  Soviet  Union  in  1991  disrupted  the  conventional  flow  of  trade, \ntransport,  and  transit  connections.  The  once-integrated  road  network  system  became \nfragmented  and  continued  to  deteriorate.  Closer  cross-border  coordination  and  economic \nintegration is further necessitated by the highly skewed natural resource endowments and \ngrowing demand. The challenges and opportunities facing the transport sector in the Central \nAsian countries are (i) fragmented regional road transport connections, (ii) aging infrastructure, \n(iii) outdated border facilities and equipment, and (iv) inefficiencies in border crossing due to \nbureaucratic procedures and inconsistent border policies and regulations. Restoring regional \ntransport links will create opportunities for rapid economic growth and sustainable poverty \nreduction. The countries\u2019 efforts have often been stymied by the shortage of investment and \nmaintenance funds because of insufficient earmarking, weak institutions, and limited human \nresource capacity.  \n \n3.  Limited Economic Opportunities. Mountainous and poor, Tajikistan is prone to insular \ngrowth with only a small domestic market and limited economic opportunities. The 5-year civil \nwar, which ended in 1997, further isolated the country and led to sluggish economic growth, \ndropping Tajikistan behind its neighbors. Tajikistan has since achieved macroeconomic growth \nand stability with an economic structure highly dependent on remittances and international trade, \nwith exports accounting for about 54% of gross domestic product (GDP) and imports about 70% \nof GDP in 2006. Empirically, an outward-oriented economic expansion is more effective for \nsmall and less developed economies. Regional cooperation on trade policy, and trade and \ntransport  facilitation  signifies  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  CAREC2 initiative.  CAREC  strategy  renders \npositive  economic  ramifications  for  Tajikistan,  which  is  strategically  located  to  provide  the \nessential  transit  needs  of  fast-growing  neighbors  like  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China,  the \nRussian Federation, and Middle East countries. Revamping the existing integrated road network \nwill spur the country\u2019s intra- and interregional trade potential paving the way for flexible labor \nmobility and capital flow, export diversification, and enlarged production and income base.  \n \n4.  Logistic  Constraints.  Transport  accessibility  is  positively  correlated  to  social  and \neconomic development. At over 27% of GDP,3 Tajikistan trade is burdened with one of the \nhighest transport and logistics costs in the world. Since its mountainous landscape limits wider \nrail network, roads are, by far, the most dominant mode of transport in Tajikistan, carrying 90% \n                                                 \n1  The technical assistance (TA) first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 7 March 2008. \n2  ADB began the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) program in 1997 with Afghanistan, \nAzerbaijan, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan to \nease the bottlenecks in regional trade and transport development. \n3  Ojala, Kitain, Touboul. 2004. Tajikistan Trade Diagnostic Study, Transportation and Trade Facilitation. Final Report.  \n ", "2     \nof passengers and 64% of cargo transport. Despite 0.1 kilometer (km) per km2 supply of roads \nand 2.3 km per 1,000 people accessibility to road network, the share of road freight transport \nhardly account for 10% of import and export.4 Poor infrastructure, and inconsistent restrictions \nand impositions of government rules at border crossings discourage efficient utilization of roads \nin cross-border trade. Efficient logistics are further hampered by the irregular distribution of road \nnetwork, adding to poverty and income disparity among geographical regions. \n \n5.  Weak Road Management. National road management and planning is centralized at \nthe Ministry of Transport and Communications (MOTC) responsible for 13,700 km of roads. \nMaintenance backlogs have accelerated deterioration of asphalt roads: around 48% of national \nroads are in poor condition and 32% very poor.5  Outdated road design standards and excess \nvehicle weight have increased pavement damages since most of the roads were designed and \nbuilt to carry an axle load of 6 metric tons and are simply unfit to carry trucks with axle loads of \nmore than 10 metric tons, now common in Tajikistan. About 30% of the bridges do not meet the \nload-carrying requirements and 7% are estimated to be in critical condition.  \n \n6.  Missing  Road  Link.  Route  M-41  connecting  Bishkek-Dushanbe-Termez  is  an \ninternational road and is part of two international corridors, European corridor E60 and Asian \nHighway 65. Various studies and reports by ADB6 and the Government confirm the strategic \neconomic  significance  of  the  Dushanbe\u2013Tursunzade\u2013Uzbekistan  border 7  road  and  the \nTajikistan\u2013Uzbekistan customs border post (Bratstvo). The project road is the main highway of \nTajikistan  linking  Dushanbe  and  the  district  centers  in  Gissar  valley  to  Uzbekistan  and \nTurkmenistan. It is the missing link in the rehabilitation of the Tajik segment of the CAREC \nTransport Corridor III.8  A two-lane carriageway with a total length of about 66 km passing \nthrough settlements and cultivated land, the road bears a heavy volume of inter-farm transport \nof industrial and agricultural enterprises. It passes by Tursunzade, a major industrial city with an \naluminum smelter, Central Asia\u2019s largest, which accounts for a large proportion of Tajikistan\u2019s \nimports and exports. Traffic is heavy near the Dushanbe exit, at about 8,000 vehicles per day \n(vpd), but decreases to about 2,500 vpd in Tursunzade. The estimated through traffic on the \nentire road is 4,500 vpd. The pavement is in poor condition, accruing economic costs of road \nusers, contributing to underutilization of road for trade and commerce, and resulting in reduced \nlevel of mobility and access. Road haulage could also complement the existing transport mode \nin case of massive rail failure. From Tursunzade to Bratstvo border post, traffic volumes are \nlower, reflecting weak bilateral relations, customs cooperation, and border post conditions.

The road is considered to be in fair condition and some road sections may \nbe included in the 2010\u20132015 road development program for reconstruction. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The Project will rehabilitate and expand the Dushanbe\u2013Tursunzade\u2013Uzbekistan border \nroad  into  an  integrated  and  efficient  road  transport  link,  in  support  of  regional  trade  and \neconomic development. The outcome of the TA will be a project design agreed on by the \nGovernment and ADB, and suitable for ADB financing.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA will expand the pre-feasibility study carried out with ADB assistance in 2007.9 On \nthe basis of the preliminary assessments, the TA will assist the Government in deciding on road \nalignment and design. The primary selection criteria will require sufficient technical, economic, \nfinancial, social, and environmental justification. Stakeholder consensus building will be the \nmajor tool for deliberation and for mutually beneficial agreements among the stakeholders. \nInitial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. The Bratstvo border post will undergo \ntechnical audits and needs assessments in preparation for investments in infrastructure and in \ninformation and communication technology, and in the associated hardware and software needs. \nBenefit-cost analyses will be performed to prioritize investments. The TA will further explore \nways of strengthening customs cooperation between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan by modernizing \nand streamlining customs services. \n \n9.  The TA will result in (i) a firm project design and scope, (ii) a feasibility study, and \n(iii) bidding documents acceptable to the Government and to ADB. The feasibility study report \nwill contain an analysis of the road subsector, a preliminary engineering design, economic and \nfinancial analyses, poverty and social analyses, an environmental impact assessment, and a \nresettlement plan. The preliminary engineering design\u2014including the designs of identified roads \nand  bridges,  as  well  as  border  infrastructure  and  facilities,  cost  estimates,  and  bidding \ndocuments\u2014will be prepared to facilitate project implementation.  \n \n10.  The  TA  will  also  (i)  review  and  update  the  required  reforms,  lessons  learned,  and \ninvestments in the road transport and cross-border trade; (ii) develop an investment package of \nroad and cross-border infrastructure, management, and technology; (iii) make recommendations \non cost recovery measures for such investments, and on institutional and human resources \ncapacity development; and (iv) explore possibilities for bilateral customs service and systems \nimprovement.  The  TA  will  develop  a  results-based  project  framework  and  establish  clear \nbenchmarks for project performance monitoring and evaluation. \n \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Facilitation of Transport Cooperation among Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation Countries (Phase 1). Manila (TA 6294-REG). The TA proposed the rehabilitation of three strategic \nroad links in Central Asia: (i) the Bishkek\u2013Torugart\u2013Kashi corridor in the Kyrgyz Republic, (ii) Angren\u2013Gulistan in \nUzbekistan, and (iii) the Dushanbe\u2013Tursunzade\u2013Uzbekistan border in Tajikistan. \n ", "4     \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $800,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $650,000 of this total. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Fund under the Regional Cooperation and Integration \nFinancing Partnership Facility. The Government will finance the balance of $150,000 in kind, by \nproviding counterpart staff, local transport, office space and facilities, and administrative and \nsecretariat support. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  MOTC will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the road rehabilitation component, while \nthe Customs Service Department (CSD) will be the EA for the improvement of the customs \nborder post and services in Bratstvo. MOTC has implemented a number of ADB-assisted road \nprojects. Both EAs have project implementation units (PIUs) functioning under ongoing ADB-\nassisted projects. Although the present PIU staff is considered competent, more staff resources \nare needed for the efficient and effective management of the TA. The EAs will each appoint a \ndirector dedicated to the TA to monitor the day-to-day progress of implementation and prepare \nthe necessary documents and reports. The director will oversee the consultants\u2019 activities and \nfacilitate all facets of TA administration with the support of additional staff appointed by the EAs. \nThe EAs will provide (i) counterpart staff, who will work closely with the consultants; (ii) office \nfacilities in Dushanbe; and (iii) local transport for field trips. \n \n13.  The TA will require about 56 person-months of consultant inputs (20 international and 36 \nnational). The consultants will have adequate experience and expertise in road engineering, \nroad safety, financial management, economic analysis, social and environment safeguards, and \nborder facilitation and trade. Outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 4.   \n \n14.  To consolidate public opinion, achieve an optimal design, and minimize the potential \nimpact of the Project, at least three public consultation workshops will be held in Dushanbe to \nreview  the  inception,  interim,  and  draft  final  reports  prepared  by  the  consultants. \nRepresentatives  of  various  stakeholders,  including  government  officials  and  affected \ncommunities, will be invited to participate.  \n \n15.  The consulting services are expected to be implemented over a period of 8 months, from \nJune 2008 to January 2009. The TA is expected to be completed by April 2009. ADB will select \nand hire an internationally recognized consulting firm in association with national consultants \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). \nThe simplified technical proposal and quality- and cost-based selection will be used in selecting \nthe  consulting  firm.  The  consultant  will  purchase  office  equipment  according  to  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time).  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n16.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $650,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Government  of  Tajikistan  for  preparing  the  CAREC  Transport  Corridor  III  (Dushanbe\u2013\nUzbekistan Border Road) Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "  Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data   \nDesign  Performance  Sources/Reporting   \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nAn integrated and efficient  By 2012, after the  Regional and national  \u2022 Continued economic growth in \nroad transport link  construction is completed,a   economic and transport  Tajikistan \nconnecting Dushanbe to  (i) traffic volume will have  statistics  \u2022 Political stability in Tajikistan and \nthe Uzbekistan border  increased from 8,000 vpd    Uzbekistan \n  in 2008 to 16,000 vpd in  ADB project progress and  \u2022 Sound country relations between \n  2012, (ii) transporation  completion reports  Tajikistan and Uzbekistan \ncosts will have gone down  \u2022 Commitment to regional \nfrom $17 in 2008 to $6 in  cooperation by Tajikistan and \n2012, (iii) accident  Uzbekistan governments \noccurrence will have been   \nreduced from 26  in 2008 to  Risks \n6 in 2012, and (v) export \n\u2022 Accumulated external debt in \nand import goods \nTajikistan, thereby weakening the \ntransported by road will \ncountry\u2019s fiscal situation \nhave increased from \n\u2022 Shift in government priorities due \n180,000 metric tons in \nto noneconomic pressures \n2008 to 300,000  metric \n \ntons in 2012  \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nA project design agreed on  Memorandum of  Memorandum of  \u2022 Adequate stakeholder \nby the Government and  understanding for the  understanding for the  consultation and support \nADB   Project is signed by the  Project  \u2022 Government commitment to the \n  Government and ADB by    Project  \nTA completion     \n  Risks \n\u2022 Restructuring of MOTC and, \nhence, changes in government \nofficials  \n\u2022 Overstretched capacity of MOTC \nand CSD as EAs due to \nsimultaneous management of \nseveral projects  \n\u2022 Lack of funding and cofinancing \nto cover the entire project scope  \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n       \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe road sector is identified as a national priority in the Country Poverty Reduction Partnership Agreement with the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) in 2002. The Government of Tajikistan\u2019s Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) issued in \nSeptember 2002 and updated in 2006 identified roads as a leading poverty reduction agent. In line with the PRSP, the road \nsubsector strategy for Tajikistan is focused on accelerating pro-poor economic growth by facilitating access to markets and \ninputs, and recommends improving access to services by establishing an effective road network through rehabilitation and \nmaintenance programs. The Government\u2019s strategy further supports trade facilitation through the development of international \nroad corridors to improve access to markets. The Government\u2019s three priority road sections for rehabilitation are (i) Dushanbe\u2013\nTursunzade\u2013Uzbekistan border, (ii) Guliston\u2013Pianj, and (iii) Bekabad\u2013Kanibadam\u2013Batken. \nRoad transport is the most versatile method of transportation considering Tajikistan\u2019s complex landscape. The direct and \nindirect contribution of the sector to poverty reduction in Tajikistan is considerable. Tajikistan\u2019s remoteness from major markets \nand its infrastructure limitations adversely affect industrial growth, domestic and external trade, and the population\u2019s access to \nbasic social services, especially in remote areas of the country. \n \nThe Project supports ADB\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II (2006\u20132008) and country strategy and program update (2006\u20132008) for \nTajikistan.1 Regional cooperation and integration with an emphasis on rehabilitating transport links with neighboring countries \nis a key strategic priority of ADB assistance. The proposed corridor, connecting Dushanbe to Tursunzade and to the \nUzbekistan border, is one of the six priority transport corridors identified in the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation \n(CAREC) Transport and Trade Facilitation Strategy formulated in  2007 and is consistent  with ADB\u2019s overall regional \ncooperation strategy, Operations Manual, and regional cooperation policies and procedures, specifically those addressing \nCAREC\u2019s strategy objective of promoting regional connectivity.  \n \nB.

Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nThe Project will have an indirect impact on poverty reduction in the country. Over 57% of the population lives in poverty and \none quarter of the workforce migrates every year to seek employment outside Tajikistan. The Project will promote regional \ncooperation by completing a missing road link in the Tajik segment of the CAREC Transport Corridor III, and will encourage \nthe expansion of socioeconomic opportunities and activities of the poor, thereby contributing to pro-poor growth and inclusive \nsocial development. \n \nC.

Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject?  \n \nThe Project is aimed at promoting regional cooperation by supporting the completion of an integrated and efficient road \ntransport link between Dushanbe and the Uzbekistan border. If trade relations between Tajikistan and Uzbekistan improve, the \nProject will foster increased cross-border trade, investments, and labor mobility, and, hence, better income opportunities for \nthe poor. Various types of road users\u2014domestic passengers, cargo owners, farmers, transit traffic vehicles, importers and \nexporters, industries, and cross-border traders\u2014will benefit. Cross-border trade mainly benefits traders and is a significant \ndriver  of  employment.  Indirectly,  it  also  boosts  local  production  and  encourages  ancillary  services  and  facilities,  i.e., \ntransportation  and  storage.  In  Tajikistan,  where  employment  is  scarce  and  other  economic  opportunities  are  limited, \ncross-border trade can generate more income for the poor.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project?  \n \nThe key needs of beneficiaries are (i) sufficient physical road and border-post infrastructure; and (ii) consistent and simpler \ncross-border procedures for large exporters and importers, small cross-border traders, and transit traffic. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \nthem?  \n \nIn general, the road transport sector suffers from lack of investment and maintenance funds, limited institutional and human \nresources capacity, and complicated trade relations. Inconsistent government policies not based on economic decisions may \nprevent the country from reaping the full benefits of cross-border trade facilitation. The Project is very likely to encounter \ndifficulties in compiling reliable data on cross-border trade activities (for use in establishing benchmarks for project benefits \nand monitoring), as these data are not captured in foreign trade statistics. The Project will support adequate cross-border \ninfrastructure, i.e., roads and border facilities, and provide feasible measures and assistance in institutional and human \nresources development. ADB will also assist the Government in improving bilateral trade relations with Uzbekistan through \npolicy dialogue. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n \nFarmers,  entrepreneurs  and  traders,  workers,  local  communities,  central  and  local  governments,  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs), personnel of public enterprises and state institutions (particularly the aluminum smelter), unemployed, \npensioners, and others associated with the proposed project area. \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., workshops, \ncommunity mobilization, involvement of NGOs and community-based organizations, etc.)? \n \nParticipatory exercises will need to be done at different levels\u2014in the community (men\u2019s and women\u2019s groups) and among \nlocal bodies, line agencies involved in road subsector development, NGOs, business entities, etc. Participatory tools such as \nfocus group discussions, participatory workshops, and community-level rapid assessment will be used to gather information. \nThe areas of participation of the stakeholders, including beneficiaries, affected communities (if any), and women, will be \nidentified and included in the project design for implementation according to ADB guidelines. \n \n3.

Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Consultations will be performed as part of the survey.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  9 \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \n \nAdequate infrastructure, i.e., transport, is essential in addressing gender gaps, as it provides access to education, health-care \nservices, markets, and economic opportunities. The Project can help in gender mainstreaming by ensuring that women \nparticipate fully in its activities. However, women\u2019s access to project consultation and participation, employment, training may \nbe limited by lack of awareness of opportunities. Awareness-building campaigns among both men and women will therefore be \nrequired, to ensure support for women\u2019s involvement. Women can take advantage of the increased business opportunities and \nimproved connectivity afforded by the improved roads. Women and girls may, however, also become more vulnerable to \nHIV/AIDS and human trafficking. \n \n2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment by \nimproving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?       Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nRecent World Bank studies show that more women are actively involved in cross-border trading and many heads of traders\u2019 \nassociations in cross-border activities are women. Therefore, fostering cross-border trade has a positive gender dimension. To \nvalidate the benefits that women and girls stand to gain from the Project, a gender action plan incorporating gender-sensitive \nindicators into measurable monitoring mechanisms will be prepared during TA implementation. Public stakeholder consultations \nwill include women, women\u2019s organizations, and NGOs to ensure that women\u2019s priorities are reflected in the project design.  \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls or to widen gender inequality? \n          Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \nThe preliminary assessment indicates limited impact on HIV/AIDS and trafficking, to which women and girls are known to be \nmore vulnerable. \nADB = Asian Development Bank, C&P = consultation and participation, HIV/AIDS = human immunodeficiency virus/acquired \nimmunodeficiency virus, NGO = nongovernment organization, PPTA = project preparatory technical assistance TA = technical \nassistance. \n \nIII.
