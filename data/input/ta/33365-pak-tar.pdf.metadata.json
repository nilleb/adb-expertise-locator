Following  the  successful  implementation  of  the  first  phase  of  the  Capital  Market\nDevelopment  Program  (CMDP),1  the  Government  of  Pakistan  has  asked  the  Asian\nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for additional assistance to continue developing capital markets,\nincluding contractual savings and institutional investments. The Government has requested\ntechnical assistance (TA) to review the operations of the State Life Insurance Corporation\n(SLIC)  and  recommend  measures  to  improve  its  mobilization  of  contractual  savings  and\neffectiveness as investor. SLIC is government controlled and the country\u2019s largest life insurer,\nwith  significant  potential  to  contribute  to  capital  markets  development.  An  advisory  TA  is\nincluded in ADB\u2019s country assistance plan for Pakistan in 2000.2\n2. A Fact-Finding Mission visited Pakistan from 12 to 17 April 2000 and reached an\nunderstanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, financing, and implementation\narrangements of the TA. The TA framework is attached in Appendix 1.\nII.       BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. The role of life insurance is becoming increasingly important in a developing economy\nsuch as Pakistan where changing industrial structures and expanding demand for skilled human\nresources  call  for  greater  mobility  of  the  workforce.  In  an  environment  of  increasing\nurbanization, traditional methods of social protection through support from families and rural\ncommunities are difficult to maintain. The availability of life insurance means that individuals can\nuse current cash income to provide for their retirement, or protect their dependants in the event\nof premature death of the breadwinner or other contingencies.\n4. In Pakistan, life insurance is not yet well developed. The life insurance premium income\nto gross domestic product ratio stands at about 0.35 percent. This is low by international\nstandards and compares to about 1.3 percent in India, 2.3 percent in Malaysia, between 4 to 7\npercent in most European countries and the United States of America, and 9 to 10 percent in\nJapan and Republic of Korea. A greater participation in particular for the low income segment of\nthe population can be achieved through more competitive pricing and management efficiency,\nregulatory support as well as product innovation and marketing.\n5. Among the key reasons for the low participation rate in life insurance in Pakistan have\nbeen SLIC\u2019s bureaucratic structure and lack of market forces to improve performance, as well\nas an unfavorable regulatory environment. Life insurance business was nationalized in Pakistan\nin 1972, and SLIC enjoyed a monopoly until 1990 when local interests were again permitted to\nestablish privately owned life insurance companies. Since 1994, the market has been open to\nforeign shareholders, but SLIC continues to dominate the market with about 90 percent of\npremium  income.  In  2000,  a  new  insurance  law  was  passed  which  encourages  product\ninnovation and quality while enhancing prudential regulation and rights of policy holders. These\nchanges  are  posing  a  significant  challenge  to  SLIC.  An  overview  of  SLIC  operations  is\npresented in Appendix 2.\n6. In addition to providing a means of saving for retirement and protecting dependants, the\ndevelopment of life insurance is important for growth of the capital market. Provided that life\ninsurance entities are run with high standards of governance, they can act as major, responsible\n                                                \n1 Loan 1576-PAK: Capital Market Development Program, for $250 million, approved on 6 November 1997; the\nsecond tranche was released on 22 June 2000.\n2 The TA was first listed in ADB Business Opportunities in February 2000.", "2\ninstitutional investors. The newly admitted foreign companies, in particular, have created new\nproducts for sale in Pakistan, including equity linked savings products. Life insurers are also\nmajor customers of long-term debt securities issued by governments and corporations. The\nlarge amount of funds that they manage, and their ability to employ sophisticated techniques to\nwatch the markets and to react to market changes, generate turnover in the capital markets\n(both equity and debt), thereby enhancing prospects for market stability and orderly growth.\nTheir size enables larger insurers to provide long-term capital for development needs, e.g., for\ninfrastructure  development.  It  also  allows  for  investment  in  new  ventures  by  including,  in\nbalanced portfolios, a level of risky stock that small investors, more vulnerable to volatility in\nindividual market stocks, could not emulate.  At the same time, life insurer\u2019s equity can be in\nhigh-quality and low-risk investments, forming a part of a balanced portfolio. Small investors in\nparticular may see life insurers as stable investments promising long-term performance.\n7. ADB has been providing assistance for the development of capital markets and the\ninsurance  industry  under  the  first  Capital  Markets  Development  Program,  including  the\nstrengthening of the legislative and regulatory framework for the industry. As a part of this\nprogram, ADB also performed a review of the Pakistan Insurance Corporation and the National\nInsurance Corporation,3 and an action plan was developed for converting those corporations\ninto limited liability companies under the Companies Ordinance. SLIC was not included in this\nprocess based on the expectation that a review, supported by the World Bank, would be\nperformed. However, this review did not take place as the World Bank subsequently suggested\nsuch review be taken up more appropriately under ADB assistance, given ADB\u2019s substantive\ninvolvement in the sector.\n8. The Government has asked ADB to provide follow-up assistance for capital market\ndevelopment,  including  institutional  investments.  As  the  countries  largest  life  insurance\ncompany, SLIC has a major role to play. It has been identified both as an institutional investor\nand as a potential blue chip investment for other investors. In particular, flotation of SLIC on the\nstock market would be in line with the Government\u2019s privatization strategy.  To fulfil this role,\nSLIC\u2019s internal processes and decision-making procedures need to be efficient, and SLIC must\nmeet standards of corporate governance appropriate to a repository of public investment.\n9. The position of a life insurer as both investor in a market and subject of investment is\nconstrained  when,  as  in  Pakistan,  the  life  insurance  industry  is  predominantly  under\nGovernment  ownership.  As  a  general  rule,  the  private  sector  has  a  wider  interface  with\ncommercial and business decision makers than a centralized government agency.  An effective\nmonopoly, whether private or public, is less efficient in providing funds than an industry with a\nnumber of major players who are able to compete. Government control of life insurers also\nincreases the risk that funds will be applied in pursuit of policy objectives other than the\ninterests of policyholders, which is not only potentially inefficient but is generally accepted to be\ncontrary to principles of fiduciary management. Given the significance of SLIC for the insurance\nindustry and capital market development, strategic options for SLIC must be evaluated based\non a sound analytical framework.\nIII.       THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objective\n10. The objective of the TA is to identify financial and operational issues and recommend\nshort-term  and  medium-term  initiatives  to  improve  SLIC\u2019s  operational  performance  and\n                                                \n3  TA 2866-PAK: Reform of the Insurance Industry, for $700,000, approved on 15 September 1997.", "3\ngovernance. The TA will provide a reliable indication of SLIC\u2019s financial position through an\ninternational quality audit, and enable assessment of its financial profile and exposure to risks. It\nalso will provide, through an actuarial investigation, a realistic estimate of SLIC\u2019s policy holder\nliabilities,  and  value  the  corporation  in  various  scenarios.  This  complements  the  financial\nreporting and risk assessment already undertaken on a routine basis by SLIC. Moreover, the TA\nwill enable the Government to evaluate various governance models and assess the potential\nand  options  for  SLIC  to  enhance  its  impact  on  capital  market  development  as  well  as\npolicyholders.  In  addition,  the  study  will  assist  SLIC  in  looking  at  means  and  options  for\nexpanding  its  business  operations,  with  particular  attention  to  the  needs  of  the  poorer\npopulation and in rural areas which so far had limited access to life insurance products. The\noutputs  of  the  TA  will  facilitate  decision  making  on  the  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  SLIC,\nincluding  the  possibility  of  privatizing  SLIC  through  the  stock  market  or  other  divestment\nmodels.  The  proposed  study  will  also  provide  a  road  map  for  implementing  the  selected\nstrategy.\nB.  Scope\n11. The TA will cover two phases: financial and operational diagnostic and evaluation of\nstrategic options; as well as preparation of an implementable action plan for development,\nrestructuring, or divestment of SLIC as agreed with the Government. This will take account of\ninternational experiences and best practices, and complement the information and studies\ninternally generated by SLIC. The first phase will include an operational, financial, and actuarial\nreview of SLIC as well as an options study, including (i) review of management information\nsystems, internal controls, corporate governance, and human resources including the agency\nworkforce; (ii) an international-quality audit of the balance sheet of SLIC to provide a reliable\nindication  of  the  financial  position,  and  to  enable  assessment  of  its  financial  profile  and\nexposure  to  risks;  (iii)  an  actuarial  investigation  to  provide  a  realistic  estimate  of  the\npolicyholder liabilities of the corporation, as well as valuation of the corporation, including\nestimation of the fair values of assets and liabilities, and of embedded and appraisal values of\nthe business; (iv) evaluation of business potential and strategies for SLIC in developing new\nmarkets, in particular for the poorer segment of the population and in rural areas; and (v) the\nevaluation  of  various  governance  models  and  strategic  options,  such  as  mutualization,\ncorporatization, or divestment, with a view to maximizing impact on capital market development\nwhile ensuring best governance for policyholders.\n12. The second phase will prepare a detailed action plan to implement the recommended\nstrategic option and evaluation of implications. The divestment options to be considered should\ninclude floating SLIC as a company in Pakistan, trade sale or partial sale, joint venture with a\nforeign partner, and breakup into a number of entities for separate divestment. The findings will\nbe presented in a report to the Government and ADB.", "4\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n13. The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $825,000  equivalent,  comprising  $496,000  in  foreign\nexchange  costs  and  $329,000  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs.  The  Government  has\nrequested ADB to finance $660,000 equivalent, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost\nand $164,000 equivalent of local currency cost, mainly for domestic consultants. The TA will be\nfinanced on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program. The Government will finance\n$165,000 equivalent of the balance of the local currency requirements, including provision of\nsuitable  counterpart  staff,  office  space,  administrative  and  clerical  services,  and  physical\nfacilities. The details of the cost estimates are provided in Appendix 3.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n14. The Ministry of Commerce will be the Executing Agency and will provide the necessary\nsupport for the team of consultants, including office accommodation, a liaison officer, and other\ncounterpart staff, and logistic support for the international consultants.\n15. Resource  requirements  are  estimated  at  32  person-months  of  consulting  services,\nincluding 12 person-months for international consultants (including team leadership), and 20\nperson-months  for  domestic  consultants.  The  proposed  study  will  require  expertise  in  life\ninsurance, financial management, property valuation, auditing, accountancy, privatization, and\nsociology/micro  insurance.  A  significant  proportion  of  the  work  will  be  actuarial  in  nature.\nOutline  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  are  listed  in  Appendix  4.  The  team  of\ninternational and domestic consultants will be recruited through a consulting firm in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\u2019s\nfor the engagement of domestic consultants. The simplified technical proposal will be used to\nselect the consultants.\n16. The TA will be implemented in two phases from March 2001 to October 2001. An\ninception report will be submitted after one month of implementation (i) providing a detailed\nwork program, including a time-bound plan for the conduct of the actuarial and operational\nstudy of SLIC; and (ii) identifying issues to be addressed. A midterm report will be submitted\nafter five months, including the key findings related to the operational and financial review\ncarried out under the first phase. A tripartite meeting will be held to determine future strategy,\nand a detailed implementation plan will be formulated under the second phase during the\nremaining  TA  period.  A  draft  final  report  covering  findings  and  recommendations  to  the\nGovernment will be submitted one month prior to the TA completion, and a final report at the\nconclusion of the consulting services. All reports will be submitted to the Ministry of Commerce\nand ADB.\nIV.       THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n17. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Islamic Republic of\nPakistan in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of $660,000 for the purpose of Operational\nReview of the State Life Insurance Corporation, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "5\nAppendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\n(cid:1)(cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:13) (cid:14)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:5)(cid:2)(cid:15)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:16)(cid:7)(cid:17)(cid:2)(cid:11)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:12)(cid:11)(cid:18)(cid:19)(cid:2) (cid:24)(cid:12)(cid:23)(cid:25)(cid:2)(cid:22)(cid:15)(cid:7)(cid:17)(cid:23)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:15)(cid:23)(cid:12)(cid:4)(cid:6)(cid:5) (cid:27)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:28)(cid:3)(cid:16)(cid:7)(cid:29)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:30)(cid:15)(cid:4)(cid:23)(cid:6)(cid:3)\n(cid:20)(cid:6)(cid:21)(cid:4)(cid:22)(cid:11)(cid:15)(cid:23)(cid:12)(cid:3) (cid:17)(cid:2)(cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:11)(cid:6)(cid:4)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:3)\nA.

The industry was nationalized under the\nLife Insurance (Nationalization) Ordinance (LINO), 1972, thereby effectively creating the State\nLife Insurance Corporation (SLIC). Private sector companies were permitted to operate again\nfrom the mid-1990s. In addition to the nationalized SLIC, four private sector companies are now\noperating in the sector, although SLIC continues to dominate the market with a share of more\nthan 90 percent. A new Insurance Ordinance was approved in 2000, providing for a level\nplaying field and prudential regulation, although SLIC continues to be covered by its own\nstatutory legislation under the LINO. SLIC has about 2 million individual policies in force as well\nas  group  insurance  contracts  that  cover  nearly  5  million  insured.  About  25  percent  of  all\nPakistani families are estimated to be protected in some form by either individual or group life\ninsurance; and the ratio of life insurance in force to gross domestic product is probably in the\nregion of 35 to 40 percent, taking into account all death benefits insured.\nFinancial Performance\n2. The most recent available SLIC financial statements at the date of writing this paper are\nthose for the financial year ending 31 December 1998. Those financial statements show a\ndecline in life insurance new business premium income over the previous year (for the third\nconsecutive year), and sustained high expense ratios. In contrast, statutory actuarial valuations\nhave been carried out by qualified actuaries every two years since 1974, and all have shown\ngrowing surpluses. The result of the 1998 valuation, reported in the 1998 annual teport, was a\nsurplus generated in the previous two years of PRs 6.23 billion (the cumulative surplus not\nallocated to policyholders is not stated). In an environment of inflation, these developments and\nthe long-term prospects of the corporation require further analysis.\n3. The financial statements disclose a balance on the life insurance fund of SLIC of about\nPRs 55 billion, and capital and reserves of PRs 511 million. However, the net worth of neither\nthe company nor its book of life insurance business can be determined from these financial\nstatements as the extent of the adequacy of the fund to meet the policyholder liabilities of SLIC\ncannot be assessed from the financial statements. While industry comment generally suggests\nthat SLIC is financially very strong, due to conservative past bonus allocation policies, the value\nof the company and of its business must be determined in order to safeguard that value and to\nallow the development of a strategy on a meaningful basis.\n4. As of 31 December 1998, SLIC had a total of 2.03 million individual life policies in force,\nwith a sum assured (including bonuses) of PRs 130.7 billion. Both figures are slightly down on\nthe previous year. SLIC also had group life policies insuring 4.46 million lives, with a sum\ninsured of PRs 409 billion. Group life showed a 6 percent increase in terms of lives covered and\n16 percent in terms of sums assured, although group life premium income fell. The total sum\nassured including group and individual life and bonuses amounts to PRs 539.8 billion.\n5. SLIC\u2019s growth of premium income over the past few years has been weak, and actually\ndeclined in 1997 and 1998. In 1998, SLIC had premium income of PRs 6.96 billion, a reduction\nof 4.2 percent on the previous year (which was itself down 5.1 percent on 1996).  Group life\npremium (PRs 1.24 billion) was down 11.9 percent on the prior year, reversing the previous\nyear\u2019s gains, while first year premium on individual and annuity premiums (PRs 1.31 billion) fell\nby more than 12 percent for the third successive year. Renewal premium (PRs 4.41 billion)\n(Reference in text: page 1, para. 5)", "8\nAppendix 2, page 2\nincreased 1.1 percent over the previous year, stabilizing after a 7.0 percent decline in the\nprevious year. Persistency rates (the extent to which policies are renewed) are not disclosed in\nthe financial statements but the lack of significant increase in renewal premiums suggests that\npersistency rates are very low. As a rough indicator, the second year premium in 1998 was 50.9\npercent of the previous year\u2019s first year premium on long-term policies.\n6. The yield on the life insurance fund in 1998 was 11.8 percent (compared to 13.0 percent\nin 1997).  The 1998 figure is the lowest since 1980, although the accounts ascribe the low figure\nto investment provisions, which were substantially recouped following the balance date. The\nbonus  crediting  policy  of  SLIC  is  not  disclosed  in  the  financial  statements  although  this\ninformation  is  available  in  the  actuarial  valuation  reports.  For  SLIC,  bonuses  have  been\ndeclared at differing rates as specified under the LINO1972. Certain bonuses are described as\nspecial reversionary bonuses, which are issued periodically rather than maintaining a consistent\nlevel of bonuses.\n7. Expenses in 1998, not including investment expenses, were 53.6 percent of premium\nincome (up from 43.2 percent in 1997, although the increase can be ascribed to a decision in\n1998 to recognize staff entitlement liabilities not previously brought to account).  The expense\nratio has exceeded 30 percent throughout the life of SLIC, and 40 percent since 1995.\n8. The investment portfolio of SLIC as of 31 December 1998 was PRs 54.02 billion. The\nmajor  constituents  of  this  were  Government  securities  (74.5  percent),  equity  shares  (9.0\npercent), loans to policyholders (7.4 percent) and real estate (4.9 percent).  The accounting\npolicies adopted mean that these figures do not represent the fair value of the assets taken as a\nwhole.\nCorporate Structure and Alternatives\n9. SLIC is a statutory corporation established under the LINO, 1972, and not registered\nunder the Companies Ordinance. In its structure, it resembles the joint stock corporations that\nhave been seen in Canada and the United Kingdom. The Government has the single largest\nownership share in SLIC, but it is the group of the many \u201cwith profits\u201d policyholders that have\nthe largest stake in the company on aggregate. Policyholders are entitled to the majority of the\nprofits produced by SLIC, and the Government may thus be cautious not to consider outright\nsale of its stake in the corporation to a new investor without considering the interests of the\nother stakeholders, i.e. the policyholders in particular.\n10. Given the interests of policyholders, it becomes a question of how much an independent\ninvestor would be prepared to pay for \u2019ownership\u2019 of a company  in which he would only receive\na smaller fraction of future profits. Because of this situation, it has occasionally been suggested\nthat SLIC be fully \u2018mutualized\u20191. The mutual company model has worked reasonably well in the\npast and some of the largest companies of the world are mutuals. However, companies that\nseek to develop its business that requires additional capital are increasingly finding their mutual\nstyle of ownership a handicap. As a result, all the major mutual companies in the United\nKingdom and North America are engaged in a process of de-mutualization, turning themselves\nback into joint stock companies for listing on the stock exchange.\n                                                \n1  Under such a process, the surplus in the insurance funds is used to purchase and then retire all the shares in\nthe company that are owned by the shareholder. Subsequently, the company is exclusively owned by its\npolicyholders.", "9\nAppendix 2, page 3\n11. The  present  de-mutualization  models  are  interesting  because  all  four  of  the  major\nCanadian mutuals have decided that the best, first step to take on the process is to issue\nshares  to  all  \u201cwith  profit\u201d  policyholders,  whereby  the  value  of  the  equity  policyholders  is\nestimated with the help of technical experts such as actuaries, accountants and appraisers. The\nshares are then distributed in a manner that is proportional to the equity of each policy holder.\nOnce shares are issued, the policyholders-turned-shareholder can offer their shares for sale in\nthe stock market. If such a process was adopted for SLIC, the Government could retain its\ninterest initially, but then offer it for sale either on the stock market or to a strategic investor\nonce the de-mutualization process was complete. It may be advisable to carry out a program for\noperational re-structuring to make it more efficient and to introduce updated technology prior to\nany offering for sale.\n12. In another case, a United States mutual insurance company was acquired by the AXA\ngroup of France in a transaction that saw AXA contribute a substantial amount of capital to the\nnewly acquired company. The policy holders did not receive any shares in that transaction.\nHowever, their right for profits was sustained. If such a model was considered, perhaps a joint\nventure partner could be obtained for SLIC. The price that partner might be prepared to pay\nwould  be  a  function  of  the  Government\u2019s  stake  and  the  estimated  cost  of  necessary\nrestructuring.\nKey Operational Concerns and Possible Action Needed Prior to Divestment\n13. The operational reviews of the Pakistan Insurance Corporation and National Insurance\nCorporation  conducted  under  TA  2866-PAK  identified  a  number  of  institutional  concerns\nrequiring action to improve prospects for development of the insurance industry, as well as\nstructural issues needing to be addressed before consideration can be given to divesting the\ncorporations.  Concerns  are  expected  to  exist  for  any  Government  entity  considered  for\nprivatization.\n14. Financial  reporting.  Like  the  other  insurance  corporations  in  Pakistan,  SLIC  issues\nfinancial statements that are not in accordance with international practice for financial reporting\nof  insurance  activities.  The  financial  statements  do  not  disclose  the  extent  of  SLIC\u2019s\npolicyholder  liabilities,  or  the  extent  of  retained  earnings  attributable  to  policyholders.  The\ncarrying values of various assets and liabilities give little indication of their fair value. This is of\nparticular relevance in the case of holdings of real property (held at cost less depreciation), for\nwhich the fair value of properties acquired many years ago may greatly exceed book value,\nwhile that of buildings constructed recently may fall short. Maturities of assets and liabilities are\nnot  disclosed.  The  International  Accounting  Standards  Committee  is  currently  developing\nstandards for (i) financial reporting of insurance business and (ii) financial instruments.\n15. The preparation of SLIC\u2019s financial statements is a very slow process, with financial\nstatements not being available until well after six months from the balance date. Such slow\naccounts preparation cannot be considered adequate for a company for which divestment and\nlisting is contemplated, and SLIC\u2019s accounting processes, management information systems,\nand books and records generally require reengineering.\n16. Audit practices. The audit of SLIC is conducted by a panel of auditors with regional\nresponsibilities, rather than by a single or joint auditors having responsibility for the audit of the", "10\nAppendix 2, page 4\nentire financial statements.  The ability of an audit performed on this basis to provide the basis\nfor an audit opinion as generally considered to be questionable.\n17. Internal Controls. The effectiveness of SLIC\u2019s internal controls is open to question.\nDuring 1999, irregularities were apparently detected that led SLIC management to recommend\nthe appointment of consultants to undertake a complete verification of all SLIC transactions\nduring a specified period.  While the benefit of such an exercise is dubious compared with the\nlikely cost, this matter suggests a lack of confidence by management in SLIC\u2019s internal controls.\n18. Distribution. SLIC has branches throughout Pakistan, but is also operating in the United\nArab Emirates, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. SLIC\u2019s distribution system is dominated by agents, of\nwhich it has more than 100,000. A large number of SLIC\u2019s regional managers are agents rather\nthan employees. The ability of SLIC to control such a sales force is doubtful, although its legal\nability to do so is strengthened by the provisions of the proposed new Insurance Ordinance. The\nsuitability of many agents, particularly in the context of increasing innovation in the industry,\nmay also be doubtful. In past years, attempts to discontinue agents whose performance is\nunsatisfactory have led to protests against SLIC. While SLIC may now be on sounder legal\ngrounds, the possibility of such action cannot be ruled out.\n19. Due diligence and valuation. Prior to taking action to divest SLIC, a due diligence\ninvestigation of SLIC will be required. This will comprise a financial audit and actuarial financial\ncondition investigation to be carried out to international standards. The primary purpose of this\nexercise will be to value SLIC, to satisfy its owners as to its solvency, to identify risk exposure\n(e.g.,  from  asset-liability  mismatch),  and  to  identify  other  operational  and  institutional\nweaknesses in matters such as corporate governance and investment policy.\n20. Following due diligence, an action plan can be developed to address concerns identified,\nand to maximize the value realized by divestment of the Government\u2019s investment in SLIC,\nwhile protecting the interests of its policyholders.", "11\nAppendix 3\nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN\n($'000)\nForeign Local Total\nItem Exchange Currency Cost\nA.
