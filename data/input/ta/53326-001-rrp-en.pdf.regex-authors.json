THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nIndia  for  the  Bengaluru  Metro  Rail  Project.  The  report  also  describes  proposed  technical \nassistance (TA) for Support for Integrated and Sustainable Urban Development along Mass Rapid \nTransit Corridors in Bengaluru City, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under \nthe authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.  The project will support the Government of India in expanding the metro railway network \nin Bengaluru city by financing two new metro corridors totaling 56 kilometers (km) in length. The \nproject  will  also  support  the  preparation  of  urban  development  plans  and  implementation \nframeworks based on the principles of transit-oriented development (TOD) and multimodal \nintegration (MMI). In addition, the project will improve the institutional capacity of relevant state \ngovernment  agencies  and  stakeholders  at  all  levels  for  the  delivery  of  sustainable  and \ncomprehensive urban mobility solutions and planning, designing, and managing TOD-based \nurban development schemes and programs. The project will improve mobility, livability, and the \nurban environment in Bengaluru by supporting provision of an efficient, safe, and inclusive \ntransport system for all commuters that caters to the needs of elderly, women, children, and \ndifferently abled persons. The project is included in the country operations business plan for India, \n2020\u20132022 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).1  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Bengaluru city. Bengaluru is the capital city of the state of Karnataka in southern India.2 \nIt is India\u2019s fourth most populous city and one of the largest and fastest-growing metropolitan \nareas in the country, with an estimated population of 12.34 million in its urban area as of 2017, \nup from 8.5 million in 2011.3 Bengaluru district is the most urbanized in Karnataka state, with 91% \nof its population living in urban areas. The city is a leading center of high-technology industries \nand information technology (IT), including robotics, biotechnology and engineering, electronics, \nand IT-enabled services. Manufacturing, services, and small and medium-sized enterprises in \ndiversified sectors also make significant contributions to the local economy. \n \n4.  Urban environment. The population of Bengaluru grew 49% from 2000 to 2018. Migration \nfrom other areas in Karnataka and elsewhere, driven by work opportunities, has accounted for \nabout 30% of that growth.4 It is expected that the population of Bengaluru city will reach 16.2 \nmillion by 2030, from about 11.4 million in 2018.5 The rapid pace of urbanization has not been \nwithout problems, which include urban sprawl, unplanned and/or sporadic development, and \ninadequate infrastructure. This has resulted in congestion, declining mobility for people and goods, \nhigh land prices, deteriorating infrastructure, and environmental degradation. These impacts \nreduce productivity, inhibit economic efficiency, and negatively affect quality of life. Although the \n \n1  ADB. 2019. Country Operations Business Plan: India, 2020\u20132022.

Bengaluru. \n ", "2 \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) has slowed economic activity in the city, the trend of population \ngrowth and urbanization is expected to continue. \n \n5.  Transport congestion. Rapid population growth and urbanization, a lack of integrated \nurban planning, and lagging transport network development have contributed to Bengaluru being \none of the most congested cities in the world.6 Peak hour traffic congestion in the city is worse \nthan in other major cities in India, including Delhi and Mumbai, and the cost of congestion in the \ncity is estimated at $6 billion per year. 7 Vast urban sprawl is lengthening the average travel \ndistance and time for commuters, especially for those travelling by private vehicle, while average  \ntravel speeds have been steadily declining.8 \n \n6.  Public transport. Compared with other Indian megacities, Bengaluru relies heavily on \nroad transport (footnote 7). Public transport in the city consists of railway, bus, and metro rail. The \nrailway is mainly used for intercity services, although a few morning and evening suburban trains \nserve commuters living outside the city. Public bus service is the mainstay, mainly operated by \nBangalore  Metropolitan  Transport  Corporation,  with  a  fleet  of  6,000  city  buses  providing \ntransportation to more than 3.5 million passengers per day.9 However, city bus travel has been \nadversely affected by the rising congestion and declining average travel speeds on the city\u2019s \nroads. Average daily ridership of buses declined from 5.0 million in fiscal year (FY) 2014 to \n3.5 million in FY2019.10 Inadequate public transport and growth in family incomes in Bengaluru \nhave resulted in a sharp increase in private vehicles on the roads. The number of registered \nvehicles in Bengaluru city rose from 3.2 million in 2009 to 8.6 million in 2020.11 A 2016 survey \nfound that about 91% of respondent households would be willing to shift to an improved public \ntransport system if it offers attractive savings in travel time and cost.12 \n \n7.  Road network. The total road length in the city boundary is about 2,537 km, 20% of which \nis of four lanes or more. The major roads are the Outer Ring Road (ORR) and six radial arterial \nroads stretching outward from the city center. The ORR, with a length of about 60 km, envelops \nBengaluru\u2019s core. Most government, business, commercial, and institutional establishments are \nwithin or along the ORR. This has led to high pressure on housing, civic infrastructure, traffic \ncongestion, and pollution. Radial roads and the ORR are heavily congested, and intersections of \nthe ORR and radial roads are often gridlocked despite efforts to improve the roads and construct \nflyovers. The road network inside the ORR is already close to capacity, and little land is available \nto strengthen the transport system because of high land prices and dense development. The \nnewer business zones are mainly located along the ORR and along the north\u2013south axis outside \nthe ORR. Meanwhile, outside the ORR, accessibility to transport is constrained because of a less \ndense road network and fewer public transport services. New circular roads outside the ORR \nhave been proposed and discussed for years, but not implemented. \n \n \n6  ADB. 2019. Fostering Growth and Inclusion in Asia\u2019s Cities.

Multinational  IT  and  IT-enabled  service  industries \nemploying numerous professionals are located in IT parks along  the ORR, and along National \nHighway 44 (NH-44). A radial arterial road stretching northeast from the city core, NH-44, is the \nmain access road for Bengaluru\u2019s Kempegowda International Airport (KIA).13 NH-44 is the locus \nfor the growing peri-urban areas north and northeast of Bengaluru, where land is available and \nKIA acts as a development magnet. This has catalyzed residential and industrial development \nbetween Bengaluru city and the town of Devanahalli to the north. The ORR and NH-44 form the \nmain access route from the north to the city.  \n \n9.  Bengaluru Metro. Metro rail is the newest form of public transport in the city. Established \nin 2005 as a special purpose vehicle jointly held by the Government of India and the State \nGovernment of Karnataka, Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) constructed and \noperates the Bengaluru Metro. Phase 1 of Bengaluru Metro, which is 42.3 km long, was completed \nand became fully operational in 2017.14 It comprises the East\u2013West (Purple Line) and North\u2013\nSouth (Green Line) lines. Phase 2 will extend the Purple and Green lines and construct two new \ncorridors (Pink and Yellow lines) with a total length of 72.1 km. Phase 2 is being commissioned \nprogressively, beginning in 2020, and will become fully operational by 2024.15 Phases 2A and 2B \nare  new  phases  planned  as  another two  new  corridors  (expressed  in  blue  and  light  blue \nrespectively in project map). Developing metro rail connectivity along the ORR and NH-44 toward \nKIA will significantly improve the public transport situation and reduce the number of private \nvehicles on the road. \n \n10.  Social inclusion and green transport. Congestion increases travel time and costs, \nimposes social and economic costs on society, and impedes economic activity and growth. \nConstrained mobility has more adverse effects on socially vulnerable people, including the elderly, \nwomen, and differently abled persons. Newer metros in India have adopted good practices for \ngender equality and social inclusion, which this project will also adopt (para. 36).16 A survey \nconducted by BMRCL in February 2020 found that 41.1% of Bengaluru Metro users are female, \nand that women consider metro rail safer than conventional public transport modes. Users also \nappreciate the affordability of metro rail since about 56.6% of Bengaluru Metro users have \nmonthly incomes of less than \u20b950,000 (about $660). Meanwhile, the rapidly rising quantity of \nvehicles on the road has caused the air quality in Bengaluru to deteriorate; concentration of \nparticulate  matter  10  (PM10)  exceeded  international  standard  in  2019.17 Improved  public \ntransport, especially rail-based mass transit, leads to fewer private vehicles on the road and \nimproves air quality and the environment in general. \n \n11.  Multidimensional approach to urban development and transport. Population growth \nin  Bengaluru  city  creates  challenges  related  to  urbanization,  especially  traffic  congestion, \ndecreased mobility, and poor quality of life. To become a livable and inclusive city that balances \neconomic growth with environmental and social equality considerations, Bengaluru needs to \n \n13 KIA is the third busiest airport in the country, with 33.3 million passengers in 2018\u20132019.

To meet the development objectives of the city, the state government \nplans to (i) expand and improve public mass transit systems for the city, including metro rail, \nsuburban rail, and bus transport; and (ii) pursue TOD, an urban development model to realign \ngrowth and densities along sustainably developed mass transit corridors to create higher density, \ncompact, mixed use, mixed income, safe, and resource efficient neighborhoods. TOD aims to \nraise land values along these corridors, generating capital revenues for the state government to \nmeet the city\u2019s long-term investment needs. However, implementing the approach will require \nstrengthening the capacity of relevant state agencies.18 \n \n12.  Government strategy. Supporting rail-based mass transit is in line with the National \nUrban Transport Policy 2006 of India, which promotes TOD and emphasizes nonmotorized and \npublic transport over private automobiles.19 TOD is promoted under the National Transit Oriented \nDevelopment Policy 2017. Rail-based mass transit will alleviate air pollution in the city, in line with \nIndia\u2019s Nationally Determined Contribution to  reducing global greenhouse gas emissions.20 \nImproved public transport and TOD are also in line with the development plan of Bengaluru city \n(footnote 5). The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act (2016) of India promotes mobility of \nvulnerable people. At state level, the Directorate of Urban Land Transport, established in 2007, \noversees all urban land transport initiatives in Karnataka state including MMI. BMRCL issued the \ndraft Bengaluru Transit Oriented Development Policy in February 2019.21 The state government \nwill revise the city master plan to integrate TOD principles in urban development plans and state \nregulations. The state government is expected to approve the Comprehensive Mobility Plan for \nBengaluru by 2021 as a long-term plan of transport in the city emphasizing the needs of the metro. \nThe  project  remains  a  high  priority  for  the  government  because  public  expenditure  on \ninfrastructure can stimulate economic activity by creating jobs, thereby supporting the country\u2019s \nefforts to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s strategic context. The project is aligned with all three pillars of ADB\u2019s country \npartnership strategy: (i) boosting economic competitiveness by expanding infrastructure networks \nand corridor development, (ii) providing inclusive access to these infrastructure networks, and (iii) \naddressing climate change.22 The project also meets the following operational priorities of ADB\u2019s \nStrategy  2030:  (i)  addressing  remaining  poverty  and  reducing  inequalities;  (ii)  accelerating \nprogress in gender equality; (iii) tackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, \nand enhancing environmental sustainability; and (iv) making cities more livable.23 \n \n14.  Implications of coronavirus disease on public transport. Because of the COVID-19 \npandemic, public transport demand plunged globally, with people shifting to private transport. \nHowever, considering constrained road capacity and the need for environment-friendly transport \nin Bengaluru, public transport will continue to play a significant role in transport network and a \nlivable city beyond the short and medium term. Under the \u201cnew normal\u201d brought about by COVID-\n19, public transport will be governed by new rules related to social distancing, off-peak commuting, \n \n18 State line agencies concerned include BMRCL, the Directorate of Urban Land Transport, the Bengaluru Metropolitan \nTransport Corporation, and BDA. \n19 Government of India, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

Project Description \n \n15.  The project is aligned with the following impact: urban mobility in Bengaluru improved.24 \nThe  project  will  have  the  following  outcome:  efficiency,  safety,  and  gender  and  social \ninclusiveness of urban rail transport in Bengaluru increased.25  \n \n16.  Output 1: New metro lines completed. The project will finance the construction of new \nmetro line phases 2A and 2B with a total length of 56 km, and 30 stations, about 90% of which \ncomprises elevated structure, with the remaining 10% at ground level. The new metro lines will \nconnect to other metro lines, i.e., yellow, purple, and red lines at three junction stations and Indian \nrailways at one junction station, Phase 2B will also provide accessibility to public transport along \nthe northern development axis (para. 8) along NH-44 up to KIA. Multimodal facilities to be \ndeveloped at project metro stations include motorcycle pools, taxi stand, bus bays, and pedestrian \nwalkways and bridges, which will enable smooth intermodal connectivity and provide improved \nlast-mile connectivity. \n \n17.  Output 2: Urban development plans and implementation frameworks based on \ntransit-oriented development principles and multimodal integration plan developed for \nBengaluru. The project will support the state government\u2019s plan to increase the city\u2019s economic \nproductivity  through  strategic  urban  renewal  and  densification,  and  devise  people-oriented, \nenvironment-friendly mobility solutions. Consultants hired under the attached technical assistance  \nwill deliver (i) a TOD vision plan for the metro corridors and TOD-based urban development plans \nfor six selected zones along the metro corridors; (ii) a TOD implementation framework; and (iii) \nan MMI plan for physical, informational, operational, and ticketing aspects, and support for \ninstitutionalization of this planning process. \n \n18.  Output 3: Capacity of Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited and relevant state \nline agencies improved in transit-oriented development and multimodal integration. The \nconcepts of TOD and MMI are new and complex. This output, funded by the attached technical \nassistance, will strengthen the capacity of state line agencies concerned (footnote 18) to design \nand implement TOD and MMI plans. The output will support line agencies in preparing TOD and \nMMI manuals, standard operating procedures, and tool kits. It will also support the development \nof a communication strategy, including public consultations, to promote public awareness of TOD. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n19.  The project will include strong gender and social inclusion measures, as per best practices \nfollowing  previous  metro  projects.  The  project  includes  non  ADB-administered  parallel \ncofinancing with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), which will finance rolling \nstock and signaling and telecommunication. A public\u2013private partnership module is in advanced \nstage of discussion with Bangalore International Airport Ltd. to construct and lease back the metro \nline within the airport boundary. In addition, corporate sponsorships of station access and co-\nbranded stations have been finalized or under negotiations as part of public\u2013private partnership \n \n24 Government of India, Ministry of Urban Development. 2006.

ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department initiated discussion with \nBMRCL  to  build  up  their  capacity  to  explore  non-sovereign  borrowing  to  address  future \nrequirements. The project will showcase the multidimensional approach of urban and public \ntransport to pursue effective urban transformation and to facilitate replication to other metro \nprojects elsewhere in India, other South Asian countries and regions. The project will demonstrate \neffective methodology and implementation arrangement with multiple agencies and stakeholders \nrelated to TOD and MMI. ADB\u2019s participation contributed to initiating the partnership between \nBengaluru and advanced cities, and facilitated knowledge transfer about  best practices of \ntransport-led urban development from the advanced cities to Bengaluru.26 \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $1,055.8 million (Table 1). JICA will provide $318 million \nin parallel cofinancing for components of rolling stock and telecommunication and signaling, with \ncorresponding $471.2 million counterpart financing from the Government of India. These will be \nunder separate contracts and will not be administered by ADB. \n \n21.  Detailed cost estimates by expenditure category and by financier are included in the \nproject administration manual (PAM).27 The loan will finance civil works for new metro lines. \nBMRCL will finance minor civil works, land acquisition costs, recurrent costs, and taxes and duties. \n \nTable 1: Summary Cost Estimates \n($ million) \nItem  Amounta \nA.

The government has requested a regular loan of $500 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based on the straight-line \nmethod, the average maturity is 15.25 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.10% \nper year.28 \n \n23.  The summary financing plan is in Table 2. ADB will finance the expenditures in relation to \n \n26 Planned activities will include a study tour to a partner city for government and metro officials as well as workshops. \n27 Project Administration Manual is accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2. \n28 The terms are subject to confirmation by the government. \n ", "7 \ncivil works for the proposed new metro lines.  \n \nTable 2: Summary Financing Plana \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank     \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  500.0  47.4 \nGovernment  555.8  52.6 \nTotal  1,055.8  100.0 \na  Non-Asian Development Bank administered parallel cofinancing of $318 million from the Japan International \nCooperation Agency and its corresponding counterpart financing of $471.2 million from the government are excluded \nfrom the table. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n24.  Climate change adaptation and mitigation. The climate change assessment revealed \nmedium overall risk for the project. Bengaluru is projected to experience increased average \ntemperature and occurrence of extreme weather events (e.g., heat waves, extreme rainfall events \nleading to floods). The project includes modern design and technology such as the use of head-\nhardened, heat-treated, and continuous welded rail to withstand extreme temperatures. To \nminimize flooding and facilitate recharging of groundwater, rainwater harvesting and recharge pits \nwill be installed at stations and viaducts. In addition, waterproofing of tunnel walls and parapet \nwalls at ramp sections will be carried out at the Yelahanka cut-and-cover section under line 2B. \nThese  measures  to  prevent  flooding  are  estimated  to  cost  about  $1.47 million,  including \nincremental costs. The project is considered a positive climate mitigation project as it will result in \na modal shift from road to rail, which is a cleaner mode of transport. Hence, the entire $500 million \nof ADB financing is considered climate change mitigation and adaptation costs.29 \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n25.  The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MOHUA) acting through BMRCL will be the \nexecuting agency for the project. BMRCL has established a project implementation unit in \nBengaluru, led by a project director. A general consultant will be engaged by BMRCL using \ncounterpart  funds  to  support  the  executing  agency.  The  implementation  arrangements  are \nsummarized in Table 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 27). \n \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  December 2020\u2013December 2026 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2026 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2027 \nManagement \n(i)  Executing agency  Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, acting through BMRCL \n(ii)  Key implementing agencies  Project implementation unit in BMRCL \n(iii) Implementation unit  Bengaluru, 113 staff  \nProcurement  Open competitive bidding  6 contracts  $488.5 million \n(internationally advertised) \nRetroactive financing and/or  BMRCL will use advance contracting and retroactive financing for \nadvance contracting  civil works for the project.

Project readiness and impact of COVID-19 on implementation. Readiness is high as \nthe complete scope of the project was appraised by ADB. Environmental and social due diligence \nhas been completed for the entire metro corridor. The detailed designs are ready, based on \nengineering survey results. Land acquisition and resettlement have progressed. The COVID-19 \npandemic has not affected the project implementation arrangements or cost estimate. The \nimplementation period of 6 years is adequate to complete the project without delays. Based on \ngovernment orders, guidelines and standard operating procedures have been developed and are \nbeing strictly implemented for resumption of construction works on phase 2 of the metro. Under \nthe project, construction works will include measures such as social distancing at site, sanitation \nand  disinfection requirements, temperature checks,  and mandatory  insurance requirements \ncovering COVID-19. Operation of the Bengaluru Metro resumed on 7 September 2020 with \nstandard operating procedures under the government\u2019s guideline, introducing social distancing, \nsanitization, and other safety measures for passengers and workers. \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n27.  The attached transaction TA, Support for Integrated and Sustainable Urban Development \nalong Mass Rapid Transit Corridors in Bengaluru City, will assist the state government  in \nstructuring mobility solutions and developing a new model for sustainable redevelopment and \ngrowth for Bengaluru city, taking advantage of the proposed mass rapid transit system expansion \nplan.  The  TA  will  support  the  state  government  to  prepare  urban  development  plans  and \nimplementation frameworks based on TOD principles to facilitate urban rejuvenation in Bengaluru \nby realigning growth and densities along the new mass transit corridors (para. 11). This new \nplanning approach will reduce Bengaluru\u2019s carbon footprint while enhancing land values along \nthe corridor to generate capital revenues to meet the city\u2019s long-term investment needs. To \nprovide efficient, accessible, convenient, and safe mobility options for all commuters, the state \ngovernment will use the TA support to plan enabling infrastructure and to create institutional \nprovisions for seamless integration of different modes of public transport. The TA will strengthen \ninstitutional  structures  and  build  the  capacities  of  BMRCL,  the  Directorate  of  Urban  Land \nTransport, and the state government to plan and implement TOD and MMI. The TA will also help \nthe state government incorporate lessons from similar brownfield TOD developments and MMI \ninitiatives in the region, and identify measures, including broad-based participatory approaches, \nto ensure stakeholder and market buy-in and enable urban transformation at the required scale \nfor the benefit of all segments of society. \n \n28.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,200,000, of which $2,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-Others), and will be implemented over \n24 months. The state government, acting through BMRCL, is the executing agency of the TA.30 \nThe government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office space, and other in-\nkind contributions. \n \n30 The implementation arrangements are in Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked \ndocuments in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \n \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n29.  An external engineering consultant firm funded by BMRCL prepared the detailed design \nof the civil works. The technical viability is sound, with the use of well-proven technology and \nstandards. About 90% of the project alignment comprises elevated structures on road medians \nor alongside roads, while the remaining alignment is at ground level. Station locations and layout \nwere prepared to secure connectivity with other lines of the metro, and other transport modes. \nThe impact of climate change was considered and is reflected in the design of the infrastructure. \nMMI at major junction stations will be further elaborated under the attached TA. The application \nof similar standards and specifications for rolling stock, telecommunications, signaling, and other \nequipment, as in previous phases of the metro, will minimize the operational and engineering \nrisks. The project will also introduce new technology such as nationwide integrated fare cards, \nwhich will replace the stand-alone card system in place. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n30.  Economic  assessment.  The  economic  evaluation  of the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines, and compared the project costs and benefits in the \u201cwith-\nproject\u201d and \u201cwithout-project\u201d cases, using a 9% discount rate and economic internal rate of return \n(EIRR) and net present value as decision criteria. The project will transform Bengaluru into a more \nlivable, inclusive, and green city. Its benefits were measured in terms of vehicle operating cost \nand travel time savings for both public transport users and road users, reduced road accidents, \nimproved metro passenger safety, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. The \nEIRR of the project is estimated to be 13.4%, with a net present value of $798.6 million, although \nit is based on a demand forecast prepared before the COVID-19 pandemic. A sensitivity analysis \nindicated that the EIRR remained above 9% under all scenarios, demonstrating that the project \nwould remain economically viable given adverse changes in costs and benefits. As found in the \nsurvey (para. 10), public transport users expect the project metro to remain affordable, safe, \nsocially inclusive, and gender-equal.31 \n \n31.  Financial  assessment.  The  financial  evaluation  of  the  project  was  conducted  in \naccordance with ADB guidelines.32 It assessed the incremental costs and earnings that would \naccrue to the BMRCL as a result of the project, and calculated the financial internal rate of return. \nThe project\u2019s weighted average cost of capital was estimated to be 2.63%. For the purposes of \nfinancial sustainability, capital costs, irrespective of the financier, include the cost of rolling stock; \ncivil works and its associated facilities, including stations; and a maintenance depot. Operations \nand maintenance costs include all staff costs, unit maintenance costs, and energy costs. The \nevaluation conservatively assumes that the traffic level in the first 2 years of operations will remain \nlow and ramp up to the forecast estimates by the third year after commencement. The project \nrevenues include farebox revenues from ticket sales, non-farebox revenues from advertisements, \nand rentals at metro stations as non-farebox revenue. A conservative approach to determine the \nnon-farebox revenue, at 10% of the farebox revenue, has been adopted. All financial projections \nare assessed in 2020 prices, in real terms. The estimated financial internal rate of return of the \nnet cash flows for the project is 1.92% in real terms, which is below the weighted average cost of \n \n31 Financial Analysis; and Economic Analysis (both accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 ADB. 2019.

Manila. \n ", "10 \ncapital.33 The  profitability  projections  indicate  an  operational  loss  for  the  first  2  years  of \noperations.34 The  earnings  before  interest,  taxes,  depreciation,  and  amortization  (EBITDA) \nmargin of the project works out to about 41% in FY2027 and increases thereafter. BMRCL will \nrequire a sponsor to provide support for its debt service obligations to the extent of \u20b94,803 million \nin 6 years out of 25 years of the projection period (footnote 33). The project\u2019s lending decision is \nbased on economic viability rather than financial viability. \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n32.  BMRCL, as a special purpose vehicle set up jointly by the government and the state \ngovernment, will own, operate, and maintain the new metro lines. BMRCL is dependent on \ngovernment and state government funding for capital expenditures. Any sovereign borrowing is \nthrough the government, while non-sovereign borrowing is limited and/or backstopped by the \nstate government. There is an institutional mechanism to ensure the financial sustainability of the \nmetro whereby any future operational loss will be backstopped by the state government, similar \nto previous phases of the metro.35 Since becoming fully operational from phase 1 in 2017, the \nmetro has been recognized as a safe, fast, reliable, and environment-friendly form of public \ntransport in the city. As of FY2019, the metro was able to meet its operational costs (excluding \ndepreciation and finance costs) from its operating revenue, with the state government reimbursing \ncash losses (mainly due to finance costs). With ridership projected to keep increasing after phases \n2, 2A, and 2B are operational, the metro is expected to play a more significant role in the entire \ntransport network to meet travel demand. Also, the project\u2019s TOD approach, which will be \nimplemented by a multiagency forum established under the attached TA, will remain mainstream \nin urban development in the medium and long term. Aside from guaranteeing reimbursement of \ncash losses to BMRCL, the state government will collect incremental revenues through land value \ncapturing along TOD which will be credited for the benefit of urban transport projects, including \nthe metro, in the state. Credit rating agencies have given BMRCL an AA stable credit rating for \nits 10-year secured, nonconvertible, privately placed debentures Namma Metro Bonds Series 1.36  \n \nD.  Governance \n \n33.  Financial  management.  The  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted \nfollowing ADB\u2019s guidelines.37 BMRCL\u2019s relative strengths in financial management include (i) \ngovernance by a robust national legislative framework; (ii) an annual external audit by the \ncomptroller and auditor general of India and by an independent firm of chartered accountants with \nunqualified audit opinions on financial statements and internal control over financial reporting; (iii) \nnomination or appointment of board members and senior management directly by central and \nstate governments; (iv) organization-wide use of a centralized enterprise resources planning \nsoftware; and (v) extensive experience with the disbursement and procurement procedures of \ninternational development agencies through the construction of previous phases of the metro. \nThe overall pre-mitigation financial management risk was assessed as moderate. The primary \nrisk factors include (i) vacancies at key accounting positions (recruitment already in process); (ii) \n \n33 Details are in Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n34 Defined as operational revenue (farebox and non-farebox) less operational expenses (staff, power, and maintenance \nexpenses).

BMRCL has agreed to implement a comprehensive \nfinancial management action plan to address the identified risks. Key mitigation measures agreed \nwith BMRCL include (i) hiring key accounting staff, (ii) updating the accounting manual, (iii) \ndeveloping a comprehensive chart of accounts, and (iv) fully automating processes in all areas in \nthe enterprise resource planning along with integration of existing software modules. At the project \nlevel, BMRCL has agreed to assign a dedicated team of accounting staff, headed by a general \nmanager, to assume financial management of the project. \n \n34.  Procurement and value-for-money. The project procurement risk assessment shows \nlow  to  medium  risk  after  mitigation  measures  are  implemented.  BMRCL  follows  domestic \nprocurement regulations, which are consistent with the core principles of the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time). BMRCL has experience with procurement on \nprojects funded by bilateral agencies and multilateral development banks to construct previous \nphases of the metro. Procurement will follow the ADB Procurement Policy and Procurement \nRegulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). An ADB project team will \nclosely monitor procurement to ensure timely completion of procurement activity. All works \npackages will be subject to prior review procedures to avoid any risks of noncompliance in the \nprocurement process. Optimizing value-for-money was sought through strategic procurement \nplanning and risk-managed approaches such as (i) open competitive bidding with multiple-\ncontracts bidding, (ii) attractive contract sizes for international bidders, (iii) higher-performance \nsecurities to avoid abnormally low bids, (iv) framework for prompt interim progress payments to \ncontractors, (v) additional advance payments for smooth cash flow, and (vi) incentive clauses for \nearly  completion.  There  are  strict  prohibitions  on  fraud  and  corruption  through  the  Fraud \nPrevention  Policy  and  Whistleblower  Policy  in  the  legal  framework  of  BMRCL.  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed with the \ngovernment and BMRCL. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures are \ndescribed in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n35.  Poverty. Based on 2012 estimates, the poverty incidence38 in the state of Karnataka is \npegged at 21% on average (rural 25%, urban 15%). About 20% of the city\u2019s population is believed \nto be living in slums where poverty is prevalent. The project will improve the interconnectivity and \nincrease the reach of the metro rail network, while supporting the economic development of \nBengaluru city and Karnataka state. At a broader level, economic activity and competitiveness \nwill increase, while at the local level, access to urban public and social services such as schools, \nhealth facilities, and workplaces will improve. The population, especially the poor and vulnerable, \nwill benefit from the improved urban transport and improved access to economic and social \nopportunities and amenities. \n \n36.  Gender  equality  and  social  inclusion.  The  project  is  classified  effective  gender \nmainstreaming. BMRCL conducted extensive public consultations and stakeholder engagement \nactivities in preparing a gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) action plan.39 Building upon \nthe existing gender and development initiatives of BMRCL, the GESI action plan integrates \nadditional GESI activities into the project design, including (i) ensuring that Bengaluru Metro \nphases 2A and 2B follow international standards and address gender-specific safety and public \n \n38 Percentage of population below poverty line. \n39 Gender Equity and Social Inclusion Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "12 \nhealth concerns, with a focus on the needs of elderly, women, children, differently abled, and \ntrans-person  (EWCDT)  user  groups;  (ii)  ensuring  that  TOD  and  MMI  urban  development \nstrategies  incorporate GESI  measures;  and (iii)  strengthening the capacity  of  BMRCL and \nrelevant state line agencies to be gender-sensitive and socially inclusive. The project GESI action \nplan has benefitted from multiple focus group discussions with transgender persons, women\u2019s \ngroups, and students from different learning institutions in Bengaluru. In addition, a GESI \u201cwalk\u201d \nin an existing metro station was organized with trans women, persons with visual and mobility \nimpairments, and women\u2019s groups. The walk was an opportunity to allow these user groups to \noffer feedback on issues such as access, movement within the station, and the experience of the \ntrain commute. \n \n37.  Public health and safety. Under the project, metro facilities will be used as platforms for \neducating the public on public health and safety; prevention of communicable diseases, including \nCOVID-19 and any other pandemic prevention; and the zero-tolerance approach to sexual \nharassment. Messages will be transmitted via an integrated EWCDT-friendly signage system and \nmultimedia materials in all coaches and stations. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n38.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.40 \n \n39.  Environment (category A). The project will entail new construction of mostly elevated \nstructures and viaducts with very short at-grade segments, mostly along the centerlines of existing \nhighways. Phase 2A passes through more developed parts of the city, but proposed designs for \nthis line have adopted a site-specific design approach that will greatly reduce environmental and \nsocial impacts. The immediate corridor is mostly lined with commercial establishments, with some \nportions of phase 2B passing through open  government lands and large residential areas \noccupying several segments of the 300-meter assessment corridor for both lines. Stations of \nphase 2B mostly fall within open grounds. Phase 2A passes through more developed parts of the \ncity but proposed designs for this line have adopted a site-specific design approach that will \ngreatly reduce environmental and social impacts. \n \n40.  Several  sensitive  receptors  are  along  the  alignment  such  as  hospitals,  religious \nestablishments, and schools; these will require particular attention. Because of the large-scale \nand elevated nature of most of the construction works, most anticipated risks are related to \ncommunity and occupational health and safety, especially along congested segments of the \nalignment with high pedestrian traffic. The risk of COVID-19 spread is a particular concern, both \nduring construction and operation. Other construction-related issues are noise and vibration, dust, \nwater pollution, and large volumes of excavated waste, but these will be mostly limited to the \nconstruction phase. However, long-term noise and vibration impacts as well as alteration of the \nskyline and cityscape were also identified during due diligence. \n \n41.  Based  on  the  detailed  project  report,  BMRCL  prepared  environmental  impact \nassessments  and  contract  package-specific  environmental  management  plans  (EMP),  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement, which were disclosed on the ADB website \non 15 June 2020. The EMPs, which include measures for communicable disease prevention with \nparticular attention to COVID-19 and the safety, health, and environment guidelines for metro \nprojects in India, were included in the bidding documents. COVID-19 provisions may be revised \n \n40 ADB. Safeguard Categories. \n ", "13 \naccording to national guidelines and international best practices as the situation evolves. Through \nits social and environment unit, BMRCL will ensure that all environmental safeguard requirements \nunder the project will be implemented as required in these documents. Consultations with affected \ncommunities and key stakeholders were held during project design preparation to gather inputs \nfor the EMPs. Regular consultation meetings will be held between the project management and \nthe community. In addition, a grievance redress mechanism has been established and will be \nmade available online. An external monitor will be engaged to conduct independent monitoring of \nEMP compliance. Semiannual environment monitoring reports will be prepared and disclosed in \nthe ADB website throughout construction and during the first 2 years of operation. 41 \n \n42.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). Land acquisition and resettlement for lines 2A \nand 2B will affect private assets\u2014mainly land and structures that are being acquired under the \nproject. Line 2A will entail impacts on 111 households comprising 46 titled owners and 65 tenants. \nTotal land acquisition for the project section of Line 2A will be 48,215.5 square meters (m2), of \nwhich 26,379.3 m2 is private land and the remainder is government land. Line 2B will entail \nimpacts on 380 households comprising 187 titled owners, 189 tenants, and 4 non-title holders. \nTotal land acquisition for the project section of Line 2B will be 319,244.5 m2, of which 101,217.38 \nm2 is private land and the remainder is government land. Total affected households for the two \nlines are 491, covering an estimated 816 affected persons. Land acquisition commenced in \nSeptember 2018 and should be completed by the end of 2020. BMRCL prepared resettlement \nplans, including due diligence for land that had already been acquired. The resettlement plans \noutline entitlements consistent with national and ADB safeguard requirements, summarize public \nconsultations  and  information  disclosure,  describe  the  grievance  redress  mechanism,  and \nstipulate institutional arrangements to ensure that the plans are implemented accordingly. Due \ndiligence on land already acquired indicate consistency with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \nrequirements, particularly the replacement cost principle. BMRCL is found to have the capacity \nand the commitment to ensure that land acquisition and resettlement are carried out adequately \nand in accordance with national and ADB requirements. BMRCL will engage an external monitor \nto validate the implementation of resettlement plans. \n \n43.  Indigenous peoples (category C). The project will not affect indigenous communities, as \ndefined under ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n44.
