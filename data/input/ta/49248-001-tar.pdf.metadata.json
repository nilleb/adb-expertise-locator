INTRODUCTION \n1. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is starting to prepare a new corporate strategy to\nhelp reposition the institution in the rapidly changing global environment and the transforming \ndevelopment landscape of Asia and the Pacific. The new strategy will guide ADB\u2019s operations \nand the delivery of its development assistance until 2030, and will build on the strategic and \ninstitutional  directions  determined  in  the  midterm  review  of  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic \nframework\u2014Strategy 2020.1  \n2. This regional policy and advisory technical assistance (TA) supports the preparation of\nthe new strategy to assist ADB in becoming a more relevant and responsive partner in the \nregion\u2019s economic and social transformation. A concept paper for this TA was approved on \n13 July 2015.2 The design and monitoring framework for this TA is provided as Appendix 1.3 \nII. ISSUES\n3. Despite sustained growth and impressive gains in the fight against poverty over the last\ntwo-and-a-half decades, ADB developing member countries (DMCs) continue to face many \nsignificant  challenges  and  constraints  to  achieving  inclusive  and  sustained  growth,  and \nimproving the quality of life of their citizens. As of 2011, over half a billion people in Asia and the \nPacific continued to live below the absolute poverty line of $1.25 per day. Using the $2 per day \npoverty threshold, close to 1.4 billion people (or 40% of the region\u2019s total population) remain \npoor. In addition, over 850 million people live on between $1.25 and $2 per day, and are \nvulnerable to falling back into absolute poverty if subjected to external shocks. Such high \npoverty and vulnerability is unacceptable, and must be eliminated. In addition, the region faces \nincreasing inequality, both within and between its DMCs. Environmental degradation, climate \nchange, and disasters caused by natural hazards threaten the sustainability of growth, heighten \nvulnerability to risks, and, if unchecked, could quickly reverse the region\u2019s development gains. \n4. There  are  associated  challenges  related  to  insufficient  infrastructure,  increasing\nurbanization, low agricultural productivity and food insecurity, and lack of a viable industrial and \nmanufacturing base in many ADB DMCs. At the same time, some DMCs\u2014and particularly \nmiddle-income economies\u2014face constraints to strengthening their international competitiveness \nand productivity as they seek to diversify their economies; improve their investment climate for \nprivate investment; upgrade their information and communication technology, and innovation \nbase, and move towards greater digitization; strengthen regional economic cooperation; and \nmove up value chains. As a result, economic opportunities, including the generation of jobs \nnecessary to create conditions of inclusive growth, remain limited in many DMCs. In addition, \ndemographic transitions have aggravated the challenge of youth unemployment\u2014the expansion \nin job opportunities must keep pace with the rising number of new entrants to the labor force. \nBoosting labor force employability requires addressing the skills mismatch in labor markets, \nwhile education systems (including technical and vocational education and training) need to be \nbetter aligned with evolving labor market demands.    \n1  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework for the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila; ADB. 2014. Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. \nManila. \n2 The TA title in the concept paper \u201cBoosting ADB\u2019s Relevance in a Transforming Asia and Pacific: Support for \nADB\u2019s New Corporate Strategy\u201d has been updated and changed to the current title.  \n3 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 30 July 2015. ", "2 \n5. In some DMCs, demographic changes are resulting in aging of populations, with adverse\nimplications for economic productivity; this accentuates the broader societal need to develop \nmodern,  sustainable  social  protection  and  pension  systems.  Access  to  universal  health \ncoverage is lagging in most DMCs and infant and maternal mortality rates remain high. Finally, \nthe need to strengthen the quality of institutions and governance systems to improve and \nexpand service delivery and check rent-seeking and corruption continues to be a universal \nchallenge in the region. \n6. New developments and the dynamic environment of Asia and the Pacific require ADB to\nrevisit its strategy and realign its operations in order to stay relevant and effective as a regional \ndevelopment bank. The following five considerations pertaining to the changing development \nenvironment provide the context in which ADB is developing its new long-term strategy: \n(i)  ADB\u2019s present corporate strategy, Strategy 2020 (approved in 2008) and its \nmidterm review (approved in 2014), run their course by 2020. Putting in place an \nearly process to develop a new bank-wide strategy (that will become effective \nfrom 2017) will give ADB a head start in shaping its response to Asia and the \nPacific\u2019s rapidly changing development landscape and challenges.  \n(ii)  The  international  development  scenario  is  transforming\u2014through  the  third \ninternational conference on financing for development that took place in July \n2015 in Addis Ababa, the new post-2015 sustainable development goals to be \nagreed in New York in September 2015, and a new climate agreement likely to \nbe reached in Paris in December 2015. The many strategic and operational \nimplications of these international agreements must be taken into account in \nADB\u2019s strategy.  \n(iii)  ADB\u2019s  DMCs  are growing  and transforming.  By  2020,  with  the  exception of \nAfghanistan and Nepal, all ADB DMCs are projected to have become middle-\nincome countries. However, despite rising incomes, challenges relating to fragility \nand vulnerability faced by many DMCs\u2014such as those in the Pacific\u2014will remain. \nIt  is  imperative  that  through  its  new  strategy  ADB  respond  to  development \nprogress amidst continuing challenges in the region, and become more relevant \nand effective for the middle-income countries that will be its main clients.  A key \nquestion in this regard is whether there is a need to adapt or change ADB\u2019s \ncurrent graduation policy with respect to ADB\u2019s future engagement with middle-\nincome countries.  \n(iv)  The global and regional aid architecture is also undergoing profound changes, \nwith the share of official development assistance diminishing over time, while \nprivate investment and remittance flows increase in importance. The emergence \nof  new  development  finance  institutions,  including  the  Asian  Infrastructure \nInvestment  Bank  and  the  New  Development  Bank,  offers  ADB  expanded \nopportunities for collaboration. ADB, in its new strategy, will need to respond to \nthese  important  developments  in  international  and  regional  development \nfinancing and position itself effectively to face the challenges of the future.   \n(v)  The  significant  expansion  in  ADB\u2019s  lending  capacity  starting  in  2017,  by \ncombining ADB\u2019s Asian Development Fund lending resources with its ordinary \ncapital resources balance sheet, will have a substantial impact not only on the \nscale of ADB\u2019s public and private sector operations, and also on the nature of \nADB\u2019s strategic partnerships with client countries. The new strategy will need to \nspell out how ADB will ensure the most appropriate and effective use of its \nexpanded resources to continue to improve the quality of life of citizens of Asia \nand the Pacific.  ", "3 \n7. The changing development landscape and the rapidly transforming dynamics of Asia\nand the Pacific described above require ADB to rapidly adapt and reposition itself. To remain \nrelevant  and  effective,  ADB  must  innovate  in  multiple  areas:  with  respect  to  strategic \napproaches,  operational  parameters,  business  processes,  financing  instruments,  and  its \ninstitutional and organizational setup. In this process, ADB has to remain demand-driven and be \nguided  by  the  development  needs  and  challenges  of  DMCs,  ensure  that  it  is  adequately \nresourced  to  mitigate  the  region\u2019s  development  gaps,  and  that  it  has  a  streamlined  and \nsimplified business model in place that is efficient and minimizes transaction costs for its client \nDMCs.  \nIII. THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8. The  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  ADB\u2019s  enhanced  relevance  and  responsiveness  in\naddressing the challenges of a transforming Asia and Pacific region.  The outcome will be a \nwell-grounded  and  credible  new  ADB  corporate  strategy  that  enjoys  strong  stakeholder \nownership. By supporting rigorous analyses and the provision of external advice, perspectives, \nand inputs, the TA will contribute to the preparation of a high-quality document that is well \ninformed by global, regional, and national development perspectives and expertise. The TA is \nexpected to result in a high degree of commitment to and ownership of ADB\u2019s new strategic \ndirections on the part of all stakeholders\u2014both within ADB and in member countries, including \ncentral  and  provincial  government  officials,  members  of  civil  society,  private  sector \nrepresentatives, development partners, academia, and research institutions. Such ownership \nwill create the necessary support base for the successful execution of the strategy, in close \npartnership with member countries. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9. To contribute to the preparation of ADB\u2019s new corporate strategy, this TA will support\ntwo specific outputs: \n(i)  External  consultations  and  advice.  Structured  and  in-depth  external \nconsultations on the new strategy will be carried out with stakeholders in DMCs, \nincluding  government  officials,  members  of  civil  society,  private  sector \nrepresentatives, and development partners. These consultations will be conducted \nboth online (through a website and social media) and at country and regional level \nin selected physical locations, to be determined in close coordination with ADB\u2019s \nregional departments. All subregions in which ADB operates will be consulted on \nthe new strategy, and the sample of DMCs consulted across the subregions will \ninclude upper and lower middle-income countries, as well as those in fragile and \nconflict-affected situations. In addition, the TA will host consultative meetings in \nselected donor capitals. These consultations will help provide a clear perspective \nfrom shareholders on how they would like to see ADB position itself under its new \nstrategy to enhance the relevance and quality of its support to the region, and in \nthe specific contexts of its client DMCs. This first phase of consultations will for the \nmost part take place in the first half of 2016. \nThe second phase will comprise a series of additional roundtable sessions to be \norganized in the second half of 2016, after the preparation of a first draft of the \nstrategy paper. The purpose of these roundtable sessions will be to improve and ", "4 \nvalidate this draft strategy paper. These sessions will be organized in various \nregional  and  nonregional  locations  with  leading  think  tanks,  expert  groups, \nacademics and practitioners, and other professionals.  The roundtables will help \nrefine and further strengthen ADB\u2019s future strategic directions.  \n(ii)  Background papers. Selected background papers and assessments for the new \nstrategy will be commissioned. Five papers are proposed to be prepared in the \nfollowing areas, which are important to inform ADB\u2019s future strategic directions: (a) \nkey considerations for ADB\u2019s approach to graduation of DMCs in the context of the \nbank\u2019s  engagement  with  middle-income  countries  under  the  new  strategy;  (b) \nstrategic, financial, and institutional approaches to expanding ADB\u2019s private sector \noperations;  (c)  ADB\u2019s  strategic  approaches  to  enhancing  productivity  and \ncompetitiveness in middle-income countries, including through use of information \nand communication technology and digital and other technological applications; (d) \nnew lending and financial instruments; and (e) institutional options for optimizing \nefficiency,  including  possibly  through  further  strengthening  the  role  of  resident \nmissions. These areas are indicative and can be further refined during the course \nof TA implementation.   \n10. The TA assumes a high degree of support and cooperation from DMC officials and other\nstakeholders in holding consultative meetings in selected countries and at the regional level. \nAlternative venues will be planned in case DMCs selected to host the regional and country \nconsultations are eventually unable to do so for scheduling or other reasons.     \n11. Inputs from stakeholders will be sought on the quality of consultations organized under\nthe TA. The Strategy and Policy Department will closely monitor the progress of the recruited \nconsultants in carrying out their respective assignments. A completion report will be prepared to \nassess how successfully the TA outputs were completed and outcomes achieved.    \n12. The  outputs  of  the  TA\u2014including  the  perspectives  and  recommendations  from\nstakeholder  consultations,  outcomes  of  the  roundtable  discussions,  and  findings  from  the \nbackground assessment work\u2014will be carefully considered in the new strategy document and \ndisseminated through the ADB website.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13. The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s\nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14. ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. The Strategy and Policy Department will\nadminister and implement the TA through a secretariat drawn from staff and expertise from \nacross ADB. Other operational and nonoperational departments and sector and thematic groups \nwill support TA implementation through support for stakeholder consultations and knowledge \nand analytical work for the new strategy.  \n15. ADB will convene, organize, and finance external consultations under the TA, including\nsupporting,  as  necessary,  travel  and  accommodation  of  officials  and  other  stakeholders \nparticipating in the consultations. DMC governments and relevant ADB resident missions and ", "5 \noffices will help support the stakeholder consultations held in selected DMCs. International \nconsultants will be engaged to prepare background papers in the areas noted in para. 9(ii). In \naddition, national consultants will be hired to support the regional and country consultations and \nresearch and analyses relevant to the new strategy. A web and social media manager (national \nconsultant) will also be engaged, in coordination with ADB\u2019s Department of External Relations, \nto  assist  the  secretariat  with  online  consultations  and  information  dissemination  activities \nthrough a dedicated website and other social networking media. The terms of reference of the \ninternational and national consultants are in Appendix 3. The consultants will be recruited on an \nindividual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as \namended from time to time) and on output-based lump-sum contracts, where applicable. ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time) will be \nfollowed for disbursements under the TA. \n16. In addition to external consultations, the secretariat will also organize comprehensive\ninternal consultations with ADB Management and staff on the new strategy. An interactive \ninternal webpage will be set up to share information and documentation relevant to the strategy \nand solicit staff comments and perspectives. Focus group discussions will be organized with the \nvarious departments, offices, and resident missions, and with the sector and thematic groups. \nWritten inputs on key future strategic directions will be invited from the various departments and \nsector and thematic groups, and will be integrated into the preparation of the new strategy.  \n17. The  secretariat  will  seek  early  and  regular  guidance  and  advice  from  the  ADB\nManagement Committee. A Board and Management retreat will be organized in September \n2015 to obtain the Board\u2019s initial views and inputs on preparing the new strategy, followed by \nperiodic interactions to keep the Board informed on progress on the strategy. The Independent \nEvaluation Department will be invited to provide evaluative and other technical inputs on specific \naspects of the new strategy. \n18. The strategy will reflect the outcomes of the stakeholder consultations and deliberations,\nthe suggestions from the roundtable discussions, the results of the background assessment \nwork commissioned under the TA, and the advice and contributions of ADB\u2019s staff, Management \nand Board. The strategy is expected to be finalized by the first quarter of 2017. \nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n19. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 on a grant basis for \nHelping  Transform  Asia  and  the  Pacific:  Support  for  ADB\u2019s  New  Corporate Strategy, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board.
