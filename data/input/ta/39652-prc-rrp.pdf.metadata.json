A summary environmental impact assessment for the \nAssessment  Project 1  was  prepared  and  circulated  to  the  Board  on  \n10 April 2006.  \n   \nInvestment Program   The  Investment  Program  is  located  in  remote  rural  areas  of \nDescription  Zhangye  City  (Zhangye)  of  Gansu  Province  (Gansu),  a  poor \nwestern province. The Investment Program will partially finance \nthe  Heihe  river  cascade  hydropower  development  scheme,  a \nlarge  infrastructure  project  with  seven  discrete  run-of-river \nmedium hydropower plants (HPPs). Construction of the scheme, \nwhich  started  in  1996,  will  develop  an  aggregated \n645.5 megawatts (MW) of hydropower. Of the seven HPPs in the \nscheme, two are already in operation. Two more HPPs are under \nconstruction  and  will  be  in  operation  in  2006\u20132007.  The \nInvestment Program involves construction of the next two HPPs in \nthe  scheme\u2014(i)  Project  1,  50.5  MW  Erlongshan  HPP;  and \n(ii) Project 2, 60 MW Dagushan HPP. The remaining 112 MW Bao \nPinghe HPP on the scheme is expected to be constructed through \npublic-private  partnership.  A  parallel  rural  grid  improvement \nproject to renovate, modernize, and strengthen the 10 kilovolt (kV) \nand 35 kV electricity distribution networks is being financed by the \nGansu  provincial  government  (GPG)  to  provide  improved  and \nreliable electricity supply to rural consumers in Zhangye. Capacity \nbuilding of the project implementing agencies (PIAs) has been \ncarried out as part of the project preparatory technical assistance \n(TA).  \n \nThe development of the scheme is consistent with GPG\u2019s priority \nand plan to promote hydropower development in Zhangye and \nGansu  to  meet  the  growing  electricity  demand  in  an \nenvironmentally sustainable manner. The scheme is an integral \npart  of  the  power  system  planning  and  least-cost  generation \nexpansion  plan  in  Gansu  to  provide  additional  generation \ncapacity. The scheme is a core infrastructure project included in \nthe  Zhangye  city  government\u2019s  (ZCGs)  investment  plan  for \n2006\u20132010. The scheme is part of the Heihe river basin plan, \nprepared by the Ministry of Water Resources and approved by the \nState Council in 2001.     \n ", "ii \nMultitranche  Financing  The multitranche financing facility (MFF) amounting to $50 million \nFacility  will help fund the Investment Program and represents about 45% \nof  the  total  financing.  The  individual  and  periodic  financing \nrequests  (PFR)  will  be  converted  into  two  loans  in  line  with \nindividual  project  readiness,  as  well  as  policy,  safeguards, \nfinancial management, and fiduciary oversight. The project loans \nwill be made from ordinary capital resources (OCR) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The utilization period of the facility will \nbe  7  years.  The  Government  has  entered  into  a  Framework \nFinancing Agreement (FFA) with ADB. Pursuant to the FFA, the \nGovernment has submitted to ADB the first PFR in the amount of \n$22 million. The first PFR is presented to the Board together with \nthe FFA. Prior to ADB acceptance of the second PFR, ADB will \nensure that the Government, the Executing Agency (EA), and the \nPIA comply fully with the terms and conditions of the FFA. An \nADB team will conduct due diligence to this effect to ensure that \nthe  terms  and  conditions  are  satisfactorily  adhered  to.  The \nindividual  PFR  should  be  for  a  minimum  loan  amount  of  \n$20 million. \n   \nRationale  PRC\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  and  low  per  capita  energy \nconsumption are driving up the demand for electricity, which has \noutpaced economic growth in the last 3 years. The result is power \nshortages in many parts of the PRC. The power shortages have \naffected  the  rural  population  disproportionately.  With  coal-fired \npower plants supplying about 81% of the country\u2019s electricity, the \nelectricity sector is a major air polluter. More than 60% of the \ncities do not meet air quality standards. Acid rain falls on one third \nof  the  country.  The  Government  is  committed  to  minimize \nemissions  and  improve  air  quality.  In  2006,  it  enacted  the \nRenewable  Energy  Law,  which  is  expected  to  lead  to  about \n120 gigawatts (GW) of additional clean and renewable energy in \nthe country by 2020. Small and medium hydropower development \nis  an  integral  part  of  the  renewable  energy  program  and  is \nexpected to provide 80 GW of the additional capacity by 2020.  \n \nIn Gansu, about 81% of the electricity was produced by coal-fired \npower plants in 2005. Thirteen of Gansu\u2019s 14 cities do not meet \nair  quality  standards;  its  capital,  Lanzhou,  has  the  worst  air \npollution index of 47 major cities. Some parts of Gansu, such as \nthe Hexi corridor, have faced chronic power shortages due to \nlimited local generation capacity and large distances from nearby \npower  plants.  Heihe  river,  flowing  in  the  remote  mountainous \nareas  of  Zhangye,  a  predominantly  rural  area  located  in  the \nmiddle of the Hexi corridor, presents an excellent source of clean \nand  renewable  energy  closer  to  the  power-deficient  area  in \nGansu. ZCG and GPG are committed to utilize this clean energy \nsource to provide benefits to Zhangye and the Hexi corridor in an \nenvironmentally sustainable manner.  \n ", "iii \n  ADB  has  an  ongoing  successful  engagement  with  one  of  the \nseven HPPs of the scheme. ADB approved a project loan in 2003 \nto support construction of the 102 MW Xiaogushan HPP, which \nwas completed in July 2006, 1 year ahead of schedule. Project \nimplementation is rated as \u201chighly satisfactory\u201d and has complied \nwith all covenants. The PIA, ZCG, and GPG are fully familiar with \nADB requirements and have the required capacity to implement \nthe Investment Program.  \n \nADB is also supporting the development of clean and renewable \nenergy in Gansu since 2001. The enactment of the Renewable \nEnergy Law, and GPG and ZCG commitment to utilize clean and \nrenewable  energy  in  Zhangye  have  created  the  enabling \nconditions  for  accelerated  hydropower  development  on  Heihe \nriver.  ADB\u2019s  previous  engagement  in  the  scheme  has \nstrengthened  the  rationale  for  the  Investment  Program. \nConsidering the discrete components of the scheme, sequential \nconstruction, and staggered financing needs, the MFF is the most \nappropriate financing tool for the Investment Program.  \n \nImpact and Outcome  The Investment Program will provide environmentally clean power \nsupply to support economic growth in the rural areas of Gansu. \nThis is achieved by providing hydropower generation closer to the \nrural  areas  in  Zhangye  and  the  Hexi  corridor.  This  additional \ngeneration capacity in conjunction with the ongoing and planned \nGovernment-financed rural grid rehabilitation and modernization \nprogram  will  (i)  meet  the  additional  rural  power  demand  to \novercome shortages; (ii) improve the reliability of power supply to \nrural areas; (iii) facilitate loss reduction; and (iv) advance policy \nreforms in the areas of clean and renewable energy development \nin Zhangye and Gansu.  \n   \nThe Investment Plan  The  total  cost  of  the  Investment  Program  is  estimated  at \n$110  million  equivalent,  including  taxes  and  duties  of \n$5.13 million.  \n($ million) \nItem   Total Cost \n1.

The Financing \nwill be subject to interest to be determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility, the applicable commitment charge and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. \nThe  Government  has  the  option  to  choose  between  eligible \ncurrencies and interest rate regimes, most suitable for each loan. \nADB provides flexibility in terms of repayment and interest rate \nswaps during the financing period in accordance with the FFA, \nrelevant Loan regulations, and draft loan and project agreements. \nRepayment schedules can be structured in line with the specific \nneeds of individual loans.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The ADB loan proceeds will be made available by the Borrower to \nTerms  GPG and ZCG and then re-lent to the relevant PIA through a \nsubsidiary loan agreement under the same terms and conditions \nas the ADB loan. The foreign exchange risk and interest rate \nvariation risks will be borne by the relevant PIA.   \n   \nRetroactive Financing   Retroactive financing has been approved for the PFRs under the \nMFF up to 20% of the proceeds from individual loans\u2014provided \nthat expenditures are incurred in accordance with agreed-upon \nprocedures  and  during  the  12  months  before  signing  of  the \ncorresponding individual loan agreement and loan effectiveness. \nThe Government has been informed that approval of retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to financing any project.   \n   \nPeriod of Utilization   Until 31 December 2013. The closing date for the submission of \nthe PFR is 30 June 2010. Each loan will have its own closing date \nto match its implementation period.   ", "v \nEstimated Investment  31 December 2013 \nProgram Completion \nDate \n   \nExecuting Agency  Gansu provincial government  \n   \nImplementation  The Investment Program will be implemented over 7 years. GPG \nArrangements  will be the EA. The projects will be implemented by PIAs, which \nwill be project companies created out of the Heihe Hydropower \nDevelopment Company (HHDC). HHDC was formed in 2000 by \nZCG  to  promote  hydropower  development  in  Zhangye. \nErlongshan Hydropower Company has already been created as \nthe  PIA  for  Project  1.  To  facilitate  national  approvals,  land \nacquisition, licensing arrangements, and to address environmental \nand social safeguard issues related to the Investment Program,  \nZCG  has  formed  a  lead  group  headed  by  a  vice  mayor  of \nZhangye. A project implementing unit (PIU) in each PIA will be \nresponsible for managing, coordinating, and supervising project \nimplementation. The PIU is headed by a project manager.  \n   \nProcurement  Civil works and goods financed from the proceeds of the ADB \nloans will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines.  Advance  contracting  was  requested  by  the \nGovernment. The Government has been informed that approval of \nadvance contracting does not commit ADB to finance any project.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  of  12  person-months\u20142  international  and  \n10 national\u2014will be provided to assist the PIA with implementing \nProject 1, especially in areas of compliance with safeguard issues, \nand in project monitoring, control, and reporting. For Project 2, the \nPIA and GPG will assess the person-months and nature of the \nrequired  consulting  services  input  before  finalizing  the  second \nPFR. All consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n   \nProject  Benefits  and  The Investment Program will improve the reliability of electricity \nBeneficiaries  supply to rural consumers in Zhangye and the Hexi corridor. The \nInvestment  Program  will  have  significant  positive  environment \nimpacts in terms of air pollution avoided from alternative sources. \nThe  system  planning  and  least-cost  analysis  show  that  the \nalternative  will  be  a  coal-fired  power  plant.  Based  on  this \nalternative,  the  avoided  emissions  were  estimated  at  a  yearly \naverage of 260 tons (t) total suspended particulate, 2,100 t sulfur \ndioxide (SO ), 1,550 t nitrogen oxide (NO ), and 382,000 t carbon \n2 x\ndioxide (CO ). On completion, the Investment Program will avoid \n2\nabout 1 million t of coal use per year of operation. \n \n \n \n ", "vi \n  The Investment Program will be carried out in a poor remote rural \ntownship. It will require no resettlement, only small nonfarming \nland will be occupied, affecting less than 15 households in all. It \nwill provide significant direct benefits to local communities through \nemployment generated during construction and operation, access \nto  project  hospitals  and  schools, additional  economic  activities \nthat may be supported by more affordable and reliable electricity \nsupply.  The  Investment  Program  will  also  provide  significant \nadditional tax revenue to the local county government, which may \nbe utilized to accelerate economic development.  \n \nThe projects under the Investment Program are financially viable \nand economically attractive. For Project 1, the financial internal \nrate of return is 5.84%, which is higher than the weighted average \ncost of capital of 4.17%. The economic internal rate of return is \n19.60%, higher than the ADB hurdle rate of 12%. Sensitivity tests \nand risk analysis show that Project 1 will be economically and \nfinancially viable even under a combination of adverse scenarios. \nThe  potential  carbon  revenues  under  the  clean  development \nmechanism (CDM) will further improve the financial and economic \nbenefits  from  the  Investment  Program.  The  CDM  benefits  are \nlikely  to  provide  additional  revenues  estimated  to  be  about \n10\u201315% of the project costs. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The HPPs in the Investment Program have mainly geological and \nhydrological  risks,  which  could  increase  the  cost,  delay  \nimplementation, or reduce energy output. The projects included in \nthe Investment Program are part of an ongoing large infrastructure \nproject\u2014Heihe river cascade hydropower development scheme, \nwhich  is  partially  complete.  The  PIA,  design  institute,  and \ncontractors  have  sufficient  knowledge  and  prior  expertise  and \nexperience  to  design, construct  and  manage  the  HPPs  in  the \nprevailing  geological  conditions.  The  geological  condition  has \nbeen  thoroughly  investigated  and  the  civil  work  contracts  will \ninclude  the  results  of  the  geological  investigations  and  the \npotential  geological  risks.  The  hydrological  data  for  the  last  \n60 years were thoroughly investigated by experts to estimate the \nenergy output. The associated risk is small. The last HPP is a \nstand-alone project. The delay in implementing the last HPP will \nnot in any way affect the viability of the projects included in the \nInvestment Program.  \n \nThe parent company of PIAs, ZCG, and GPG are familiar with \nADB procedures and requirements from experience in another \nHPP development in the scheme with ADB financing. The PIAs \nand GPG have the required capacity to manage implementation \nof  projects  under  the  Investment  Program\u2014on schedule, within \n ", "vii \n  the  budget,  and  to  the  required  quality  meeting  safeguard \nstandards.  GPG  and  ZCG  are  committed  to  implementing  the \nInvestment  Program.  The  associated  implementation  risk  is \nminimal. \n \nThe electricity tariffs for the Investment Program will be fixed by \nthe  Price  Bureau  in  Gansu  Province,  before  commercial \noperations of individual projects start. Since the start of 2006, the \nNational  Development  and  Reform  Commission  has  been \nannouncing the regulated tariffs for the new power plants in each \nprovince. The assumed tariff reflects the prevailing regulated tariff \nand  a  conservative  approach  was  adopted  in  the  financial \nanalysis. The assumption on tariff is likely to hold true in view of \nthe past history of full cost recoverable regulated tariff and its \nconsistent application. The associated commercial risk is small.   \n \nIn line with the rural development emphasis in the 11th Five-Year \nPlan, the Government is committed to strengthen the rural power \ninfrastructure.

THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I  submit  for  your  approval  the  following  report  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to the People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Gansu Heihe \nRural Hydropower Development Investment Program. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The PRC has achieved and sustained an impressive economic growth averaging about 9% \nfor the past two decades. Compared with its 2000 level, the economy is expected to double by \n2010 and quadruple by 2020. Given the projected growth trajectory and the relatively low1 per \ncapita energy consumption of about 0.66 ton of oil equivalent (toe) per annum, the demand for \nenergy is expected to increase rapidly. The rapid pace of economic growth has created a strong \ndemand for electricity. Per capita electricity consumption has more than quintupled, increasing \nfrom 340 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 1983 to 1,840 kWh in 2005.  \n \n3.  After the United States, the PRC has the second largest electricity industry in the world. \nBoth the installed generation capacity and electricity generation increased at an annual average of \nmore than 8% over the past two decades. Since 2002, the electricity demand has increased at an \naverage of more than 13%. This resulted in serious power shortages in many areas of the PRC. By \nthe end of 2005, the total installed capacity reached 508 gigawatts (GW) and electricity generation \ntotaled 2,470 terawatt-hours (TWh), an increase of 13% over 2004. In the past 2 years, 117 GW of \nnew generation capacity was added to overcome electricity shortages. To meet the projected \ndemand, the installed capacity will have to double from the 2005 level to about 1,000 GW in 2020. \nOne of the key challenges to maintain the sustained economic growth is to significantly lower \nenergy intensity.2 Energy conservation and improved energy efficiency in the electricity sector are \nthe highest priorities of the Government.  \n \n4.  In the PRC, electricity is produced overwhelmingly by coal. In 2005, the coal-fired power \nplants produced about 81%, while the hydropower plants (HPPs) produced only 15%. The PRC is \nnow the world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer. Production of raw coal has more than \ndoubled in 5 years, from 1 billion tons (t) in 2000 to 2.18 billion t in 2005\u2014more than 37% of global \nproduction. The electricity sector is the largest consumer of coal; it consumed about 54% of the \ncoal produced in 2005, which has resulted in serious environmental problems\u201450% of the nation\u2019s \nsulfur dioxide (SO ) emissions, 80% of nitrogen oxide (NO )emissions, and 26% of carbon dioxide \n2 X  \n(CO ) emissions. Coal consumption is the major cause of poor air quality. Acid rain caused \n2\nprimarily by SO  and NO  falls on one third of the country. In 2005, of the PRC\u2019s 342 major cities, \n2 x\nonly 128 met the acceptable air quality standards\u2014national class II air quality standards. Six of the \nworld\u2019s most polluted cities are in the PRC. Lanzhou, the capital of Gansu Province has the worst \nair pollution index of 47 key national environment cities. A combination of coal combustion and \ndesertification causes poor air quality. Of Gansu\u2019s 14 cities, 13 cities do not meet acceptable \nstandards.  \n \n5.  About 59% of the PRC\u2019s population of approximately 1.3 billion lives in rural areas that have \nexperienced rapid development in the last 10 years in parallel with national economic growth. The \nGovernment has made targeted attempts to provide universal access to electricity. With about 76% \n                                                 \n1  About one eighth that of the United States\u2019 per capita energy consumption.  \n2  Energy intensity is the amount of primary energy consumption per $1,000 of gross domestic product; PRC energy \nintensity is 0.78 ton of oil equivalent, about twice the average of the Asian Development Bank\u2019s developed and \ndeveloping member countries.    \n ", "2   \nhousehold electrification in 1990, it has achieved more than 97% electrification by 2005 through         \n(i) expansion of provincial electricity grids; (ii) development of local hydropower resources; and         \n(iii) more recently, promotion of other clean and renewable energy sources. In Gansu, with village \nelectrification of 73% in 1990, more than 97.65% electrification was achieved in 2005. The small \nand medium hydropower development has played a crucial role in intensifying electrification.  \n \n6.  Gansu has a population of about 26.2 million, with 79% classified as rural. As one of the        \n12 western provinces, its economic development has been relatively slow. In 2004, the average \nper capita gross domestic product (GDP) in Gansu was CNY5,898, about 57% of the national \naverage of CNY10,533, making Gansu one of the poorest in the country. Of Gansu\u2019s 87 counties, \n43 are national poverty counties and 8 are provincial poverty counties. Gansu\u2019s GDP increased \nannually by 9.2% in real terms between 1996 and 2000, and about 10% between 2001 and 2005. \nCoal-fired thermal power plants are the main source of electricity production in Gansu, while \nhydropower contributed only 19% in 2005. At the end of 2005, Gansu had exploited only about \n23% of its available hydropower potential of 17 GW.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Key Problems and Constraints \n \n7.  Like many other provinces, Gansu has experienced rapid economic growth and associated \nelectricity shortages, which were exacerbated by severe drought in 2003. The Gansu electricity \nnetwork  is  part  of  the  northwest  power  grid,  and  is  a  net  power  importer  from  neighboring \nprovinces. Gansu has adequate coal reserves estimated at 9.6 billion t, it also has about 17 GW of \nhydropower potential of which only 4 GW has been exploited. The Gansu electricity network is \nexperiencing demand growth of more than 13% in the last 3 years. Consequently, there is a plan \nfor rapid generation capacity expansion, emphasizing coal-fired power plants with shorter gestation \nperiod. Hydropower contribution has sharply declined from 41% in 2000 to 25% in 2005. Coal \nproduction in the same period has more than doubled from 16 million t to 38 million t. Heavy \ndependence  on  coal  has  exacerbated  air  pollution  in  Gansu.  The  adverse  impacts  of \nenvironmental pollution have disproportionately affected the poor, who typically rely on raw coal \nand biomass (e.g., wood and animal dung), and suffer accordingly from indoor air pollution. A more \npronounced  shift  toward  clean  energy  would  reduce  pollution  loads,  energy  intensity,  and \ngreenhouse gas. \n \n8.  In  Gansu,  hydropower  potential  is  mainly  located  in  small  to  medium-sized3 HPPs  in \nmountainous  areas.  Development  of  small-  and  medium-sized  HPPs  is  a  local  government \nresponsibility. Their development is generally constrained by the local government\u2019s financing \ncapacity. Private sector investment in hydropower development is limited to large hydropower \nprojects developed by major power utilities. Gansu provincial government (GPG) has drawn an \nextensive plan for local hydropower development to double the present 4 GW capacity to about  \n8.5 GW capacity by 2020. In the 11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP), GPG aims to add about 2 GW of \nadditional hydropower capacity. In the absence of innovative approaches to project financing and \nprivate sector participation, the accelerated development of hydropower in Gansu will be severely \nrestricted.     \n \n9.  Some areas of Gansu, such as the Hexi corridor, have been experiencing chronic power \nshortages due to inadequate local generation capacity and large distances from power plants. \nZhangye City is located in the middle of the Hexi corridor, about 600 kilometers (km) from the \nprovincial capital, Lanzhou (Map 1). Of its 1.27 million population, more than 76% are classified as \nrural. Of its rural population, 293,000 or almost 30% have incomes less than the national rural \n                                                 \n3  In the PRC, hydropower plants of less than 50 megawatts are classified as small; those of 50\u2013300 MW are classified \nas medium-sized. ", "  3\npoverty  line  of  CNY1,100.  Due  to  inadequate  capacity  in  the  network,  Zhangye  experiences \nfrequent power interruptions. Insufficient power generation capacity results in acute peak power \nshortages and poor quality of power supply (low voltages, frequent blackouts). Planned power \noutages are common in rural areas.4 Zhangye\u2019s economy has grown consistently by more than \n11% per annum since 2002. Rapid economic growth is fueling demand for electricity, which has \ngrown by about 50% in the last 3 years. Poor quality and unreliable electricity supply inhibits \nindustrial and commercial activities. It constrains economic growth and employment opportunities \nin  rural  areas,  and  encourages  switching  to  polluting  fuels  for  self-power  generation  and \naccompanying environmental impacts.  \n  \n2.  Opportunities \n \n10.  The Heihe river, originating between Qilian Mountain and Datong Mountain, is the second \nlargest inland river in the PRC and the largest in the Hexi corridor. It traverses northwards through \nQinghai Province, Gansu, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region over a length of more than         \n800 km. The river section from Huangzhang Temple to Yingluo Gorge (95 km along the river) in \nZhangye is an excellent source of hydropower. In this 95 km section of the river, the Heihe river \ncascade hydropower development scheme has identified seven potential HPP sites (Map 2) with a \ntotal hydropower capacity of 645.5 megawatts (MW). All HPPs in the scheme are medium-sized, \nrun-of-river power plants. Details of the scheme are in Appendix 2.  \n \n11.  The scheme is an excellent source of emission free and renewable energy located close to \na power-deficient area, in a designated SO  control zone.5 The scheme is part of the least-cost \n2\ngeneration  expansion  plan  in  Gansu  to  supply  reliable  and  affordable  electricity  to  the  rural \npopulation in Zhangye and Hexi corridor. The scheme is also referred to in the Heihe river basin \nplan, prepared by the Ministry of Water Resources and approved by the State Council in 2001. All \nthe HPP sites in the scheme are located in remote mountainous rural areas requiring little or no \nresettlement.  \n \n12.  To  alleviate  chronic  power  shortages  in  an  environment  friendly  manner  and  to  spur \neconomic development of rural areas, the Zhangye city government (ZCG) started the construction \nof the scheme in 1996. The scheme is a core rural infrastructure development initiative at the city \nlevel. Of the scheme\u2019s seven HPPs, two are already in operation, and two are under construction6 \nand  scheduled  for  completion  in  2007.  To  accelerate  the  development  of  the  scheme,  ZCG \nestablished the Heihe Hydropower Development Company (HHDC) in 2000. Four existing small \nHPPs were transferred to HHDC. ZCG and GPG requested Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nassistance in 2001 for the 102 MW Xiaogushan HPP in the scheme (footnote 6). Construction of \nthis HPP was completed in July 2006, 1 year ahead of schedule. ZCG and GPG are committed to \ncomplete  and  accelerate  scheme  implementation  and  sought  ADB  assistance  through  the \nproposed Investment Program to develop the next two HPPs. \n \n3.  Policy Framework and Capacity  \n \n13.  In April 2002, the PRC issued the power sector reform plan, which aimed to introduce \ncompetition for efficiency improvements, reduction of costs, implementation of a market-based \npricing mechanism, optimal resource allocation, nationwide grid connection, and separation of \ngovernment and commercial functions. During the 10FYP, significant progress was made\u2014power \n                                                 \n4  Rural areas are generally connected at the far end of the distribution network and where, in case of supply-demand \nimbalance, power is switched off first. \n5  In designated sulfur dioxide control zones, the SO  emissions in 2010 should be less than its 2000 level. Zhangye is \n2\none of four cities in Gansu designated as SO  control zone by the State Environment Protection Administration.  \n2\n6  ADB. 2003. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Gansu Clean Energy Development Project. Manila (Loan 2032-PRC). The 102 MW \nXiaogushan HPP is being developed under this loan. \n ", "4   \nplants  were  separated  from  the  grid,  five  independent  generation  companies  and  two  grid \ncompanies were  formed.  The  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission  (SERC)  established  in \nOctober 2002, aimed at introducing competitive power markets for power generation. Regional \nwholesale power markets are being piloted in the northeast, central, eastern, and southern regions. \nProgress in the sector reform policies is expected to continue and intensify in the 11FYP. However, \nin line with the plan\u2019s priority on rural development, the sector policies have been aligned to            \n(i) minimize imbalance between urban and rural electricity services; (ii) achieve uniform urban-rural \ntariffs; and (iii) improve access of electricity to unserved rural areas.     \n \n14.  The 11FYP highlights the strategic significance of diversifying energy supply by providing \nincreasing renewable energy including small hydropower, wind, solar, geothermal power, and \nbioenergies.  The  Renewable  Energy  Law  promulgated  in  2006  has  prioritized  renewables  in \nenergy development strategy. The law and its accompanying regulations have provided enabling \nconditions\u2014tax and tariff incentives and, a regulatory framework\u2014to promote renewable energy in \nthe country. A medium- and long-term renewable energy development plan is being prepared and \nis expected to be issued by the end of 2006. Renewable energy is expected to contribute about \n120 GW of the estimated 500 GW of the new capacity that will be added by 2020.  \n \n15.  ADB has been supporting renewable energy development in Gansu since 2002 and has \nmade targeted interventions in Zhangye to pilot new technologies, approaches, and financing \nmechanisms. ADB\u2019s ongoing support (footnotes 6, 8, and 9) has strengthened the institutional \ncapacity of GPG, ZCG, and the project implementation agencies (PIAs) to carry out the planning, \ndesign, and implementation of the Investment Program. Capacity building of the PIAs in areas of     \n(i) safeguard compliances\u2014planning, monitoring and reporting; and (ii) seeking carbon revenues \nunder a clean development mechanism (CDM) has been carried out in parallel with the preparation \nof the Investment Program. Based on the ongoing engagement of ADB in Gansu and Zhangye and \na  review  of  its  institutional  capacity  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA) \n(footnote 9), it was concluded that ZCG, GPG, and PIA are competent and financially capable of \nmaintaining and managing the whole scheme. \n \n4.  Strategies of the Government and the Asian Development Bank \n \n16.  The 11FYP focuses on optimized electricity sector development with rapid development of \nrenewable  energy,  improvement  of  energy  efficiency  by  20%,  and  strengthening  of  rural \ninfrastructure to address the imbalance between urban and rural income levels. Due to its vast \nrenewable energy resources, Gansu is one of the key provinces identified in the 11FYP to promote \nrenewable energy development.7 One of GPG\u2019s main development objectives is to improve air \nquality standards in all cities. Development of renewable energy sources and suitable hydrothermal \ngeneration mix are priorities in achieving that development goal. GPG also aims to achieve 100% \nelectrification of rural areas through development of renewable energy-based grid and off-grid \nconnections.    \n \n17.  The operational strategy of ADB aims to help the country achieve economic growth in an \nefficient, equitable, and sustainable manner. ADB\u2019s energy sector strategy includes (i) developing \ncleaner energy sources, (ii) renovating and retrofitting existing facilities to improve efficiency and \nreduce emissions, (iii) promoting the corporatization and commercialization of energy utilities, \nand (iv) supporting tariff reforms. This is complemented by ADB's strategy for the environment \nsector,  which  supports  the  use  of  economic  supply-side  and  other  measures  to  (i)  ensure \nsustainable  utilization  of  natural  resources  and  promotion  of  market-based  pricing,  and                      \n(ii) encourage cost recovery and better environmental information disclosure. In the water sector, \n                                                 \n7  Gansu is one of the top four provinces in wind power potential. Based on the estimates by the China Meteorology \nResearch  Institute,  its  exploitable  wind  resources  are  estimated  at  more  than  40  gigawatts.  The  exploitable \nhydropower potential is 17 GW.   ", "  5\nconsistent  with  the  ADB  strategy,  the  Government  is  promoting  integrated  water  resource \nmanagement (IWRM), which is supported through water legislations and establishment of river \nbasin conservancy commissions. The Heihe River Basin Commission (under the Yellow River \nWater Conservancy Commission) has been set up to oversee the implementation of the Heihe river \nbasin plan. By providing clean and renewable energy, the Investment Program is consistent with \nand  provides  support  for  addressing  GPG\u2019s  development  objectives  and  ADB\u2019s  energy, \nenvironmental, and water sector strategies.  \n \n5.  Lessons \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s  experience  in  the  PRC\u2019s  energy  sector  has  shown  that  projects  are  generally         \nwell-planned and implemented smoothly. The overall implementation performance of ADB\u2019s energy \nportfolio  is  satisfactory.  Compliance  with  covenants  is  generally  acceptable,  although  greater \nefforts are required to implement policy-related covenants. Rigorous government screening of \nprojects has had a positive impact. The project completion and project performance audit reports \nfor the energy projects indicate that overall they were implemented smoothly, and assess them as \ngenerally  successful.  Recently,  some  ongoing  energy  projects  in  the  PRC  have  experienced \nimplementation delays relating to long internal approval processes, and procurement issues. Some \nprojects have also resulted in substantial loan cancellations to cut costs. The reason is that cost \nestimates were made on international pricing standards with a high level of contingencies, which in \nmost cases were not utilized at all. In power projects, generally, the approved tariffs at completion \nhave been lower than the estimated tariffs at the project feasibility stage. \n \n19.  The above lessons have been incorporated in the design of the Investment Program. \nPreparation of a detailed feasibility report and its national approval before the submission of \nrelevant periodic financing request (PFR), and extensive discussion on policy-related covenants \nwere given special emphasis. The cost estimates of Project 1 in the Investment Program were \nrigorously reviewed and adjusted. The price and physical contingencies at a reasonable rate were \nincluded in the cost estimates. The expected tariff was assumed at a reasonable rate with due \nconsideration  to  the  ongoing  tariff  reform  and  prevailing  regulated  generation  tariff  in  2006. \nAppendix 3 presents a summary of external assistance and lessons learned.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT PROGRAM \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n20.  The  Investment  Program  will  provide  environmentally  clean  power  supply  to  support \neconomic growth in the rural areas of Gansu. Rural consumers in Zhangye will be supplied with \nreliable, clean, and affordable hydropower. This additional generation capacity in conjunction with \nthe ongoing and planned Government-financed rural grid rehabilitation and modernization program \nwill (i) meet the additional rural power demand to overcome shortages, (ii) improve the reliability of \npower supply to rural areas, (iii) facilitate loss reduction, and (iv) advance policy reforms in the \nareas of clean and renewable energy development in Zhangye and Gansu.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n21.  Development of the scheme in Zhangye started in 1996. It has been an integral part of the \nleast-cost generation expansion plan of Zhangye and Gansu. The scheme is located in a remote \nmountainous area in the middle of the Hexi corridor that has been experiencing chronic power \nshortages. The main components of the ADB-supported Investment Program are hydropower \ndevelopment on the scheme. The Investment Program includes development of (i) Project 1\u2014                 \n50.5 MW Erlongshan HPP, and (ii) Project 2\u201460 MW Dagushan HPP and their interconnection \nwith  the  110-kilovolt  (kV)  power  grid.  The  parallel  investment  in  rural  grid  rehabilitation  and \nimprovement is being carried out by ZCG. The feasibility studies and engineering design for \n ", "6   \nProject 1 were prepared by the provincial design institute and reviewed by a team of international \nand national consultants. It was approved by GPG in October 2005. The prefeasibility report for \nProject 2 was prepared in 2006 under an advisory TA.8 Capacity building of the PIAs in seeking \ncarbon revenues (detailed in para. 22) from the projects has been addressed under the project \npreparatory TA.9   \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n  1.  Potential Benefits from Clean Development Mechanism  \n \n22.  The Investment Program is anticipated to be eligible for generation of certified emission \nreductions  (CERs)10 under  the  CDM.11 The  CDM  is  a  market-based  financial  instrument  that \nassists developing countries to achieve sustainable development and industrialized countries to \nmeet their emission reduction targets. The CDM allows industrialized countries to invest in \u201cclean\u201d \nprojects in developing countries to acquire CERs that can be used to comply with the Kyoto \nProtocol.  Emission  reductions  from  the  Investment  Program  will  be  achieved  by  replacing \nequivalent coal-fired power generation. ADB has provided project financing for three CDM projects \nin the PRC, and is currently developing several more projects with CDM potential. The Xiaogushan \nHPP (footnote 6) in the scheme that was financed by ADB loan was the first hydropower project in \nthe PRC to successfully contract12 its CERs.  \n \n23.  Each project is estimated13 to generate CERs worth about 10\u201315% of the total project cost. \nHHDC  and  Erlongshan  Hydropower  Company  (EHC)  have  expressed  interest  in  piloting  the \nproposed ADB Carbon Market Initiative (CMI) for Project 1\u2014Erlongshan HPP. Under the CMI, the \nAsia Pacific Carbon Fund can provide up-front purchase of a maximum of 50% of the Erlongshan \nProject\u2019s CER generation. This could represent an estimated up-front payment of $3.5 million, \nwhich is 7.0% of the total project cost. The CMI can also (i) provide assistance for sale of the \nresidual CERs under the Credit Marketing Facility, and (ii) provide grant TA under the Technical \nSupport Facility. The CMI is anticipated to be approved by the ADB Board in November 2006 and \nto be operational by early 2007. Project 1 is planned as the pilot for the CMI.  \n \n2.  Cumulative Environment Impact Assessment  \n \n24.  Implementation of the scheme started in 1996. Of the scheme\u2019s total capacity, 209 MW is \nnow operating, 214 MW is under construction, and 222.5 MW total is planned. The scheme is \nexpected to be completed by 2012. The scheme is included in the Heihe River Basin Development \nPlan (para. 10). The design and operating regime of each project in the scheme are closely \ncoordinated with the river basin commission (para. 17). An optimization study for the scheme was \ncompleted in 2004. It also assessed the cumulative impacts of the scheme on catchment hydrology \nand  downstream  users.  Considering  that  the  HPPs  only  have  daily  regulation  capacity,14 it \nconcluded that the scheme will not significantly impact annual flow hydrograph (discharge volume \nand timing). It is also noted that the scheme is on a 95 km stretch of the Heihe river, of which       \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2003.

One alternative is for construction of a dam with greater than \ndaily regulation capacity. ", "  7\n45 km will have reduced flow. Individual environmental impact assessments (EIA) were prepared \nfor each project, which ensured environmental flow15 in the reduced flow section. To ensure that \nthe cumulative environmental impacts from the cascade are appropriately managed, cumulative \nimpacts were assessed during preparation of the summary EIA (SEIA) for Project 1. A number of \npotential cumulative environmental impacts were assessed and appropriate measures to mitigate \nthe impacts were identified. In accordance with international best practice and to more thoroughly \nassess cumulative impacts, a detailed cumulative EIA is being supported under the ongoing TA \n(footnote 9). The cumulative EIA will be prepared by a provincial design institute and the report will \nbe available before the second PFR is submitted. The results of the cumulative EIA, including an \nenvironment management plan, will be enforceable on all HPPs, including Project 1 which will be \nfinanced under the first tranche. ZCG is committed to implement the environment management \nplan from the cumulative EIA. \n \n3.  Direct Benefits to the Host County  \n \n25.  There are 32 ethnic minority nationalities in Zhangye, who account for about 2% of the total \npopulation. Among the total minority population, the largest group is Uygur (37.1%). Three fourths \nof ethnic minorities in Zhangye are in Sunan, the only Uygur Autonomous county in the PRC. The \nprojects under the Investment Program are located in Sunan county. During construction of each \nproject, the relevant PIA is required to pay an operation tax equal to about 4.12% of the civil work\u2019s \nannual expenditures, about half of which goes to the local county government. This resource, \nestimated as CNY4 million per annum transfer to the host county, greatly helps to improve social \nservices and economic development activities. However, the operation tax stops once construction \nis completed. To ensure continuation of support for rural development activities, ZCG will allocate \nto the host county 5% of the tax it receives from operation of each project under the Investment \nProgram. This will ensure continuous resource transfer, estimated as CNY1 million per year, to \naccelerate economic development of the host county.  \n \n  4.  Private Sector Participation  \n \n26.  The continued economic growth and development of physical infrastructure is improving the \ninvestment  climate  for  private  sector  participation  in  Zhangye  and  Gansu.  ZCG  is  keen  on \npromoting private sector participation in infrastructure projects and has made targeted attempts16 to \nseek private investments in the development of HPPs in the scheme. However, private sector \nresponse has been muted. The main reasons are (i) sensitivity to perceived geological risks, which \nmay potentially delay project construction; (ii) limited private capital which gets attracted to large \npower utilities developing bigger power plants at a relatively low cost/kilowatt; and (iii) higher \ntransaction costs due to involved multi agency approval and clearance procedures.  \n \n27.  Based on experience in other countries and the PRC with projects of similar size, it is easier \nto  seek  private  sector  investment  in  HPPs  that  are  already  constructed  and  are  operating \nsuccessfully, as the perceived risk are much less. To reinforce its commitment to seek private \nsector participation and to free up its limited development resources, ZCG has agreed to start \ndivesting its shares in the HHDC from 2012. It is anticipated that successful implementation of the \nInvestment Program, and piloting of CMI will improve the risk profile for the larger (112 MW)          \nBao Pinghe, the last HPP in the scheme for private investment. ADB and ZCG will work together to \nseek an appropriate private-public partnership model for Bao Pinghe HPP.  \n \n \n                                                 \n15 Environmental  flow  is  a  minimum  water  flow  allocation  to  a  watercourse,  which  is  designed  to  preserve  the \nenvironmental ecosystems of the watercourse base. \n16 The HPPs in the scheme were advertised in the annual investment fair at Lanzhou for private sector investment in the \nlast 4 years.     \n ", "8   \n5.  Policy Dialogue  \n \n28.  Environment improvement resulting from clean and renewable energy is the strength of the \nInvestment Program. ADB provided a TA (footnote 8) to Zhangye to help prioritize renewable \nenergy development. The TA has also helped establish an integrated pilot biomass gasifier and \npower generation plant in Qidian township, Shandan County. The pilot project has demonstrated \nan innovative approach\u2014utilizing agriculture crop residues to produce domestic fuel and generate \npower,  thereby  providing  additional  income  to  the  rural  poor.  The  11FYP  has  prioritized \ndevelopment of wind power (5 GW) and biomass power generation (5.5 GW). Gansu is one of the \nfour  provinces  that  have  been  identified  for  1  GW  of  wind  power.  Continued  support  for \ndevelopment  of  such  renewable  energy  projects  would  help  remove  barriers,  accelerate \ndeployment of new technologies, and implement more clean energy projects. \n \nD.  Program Investment Plan \n \n29.  The total cost of the Investment Program is estimated at $110 million equivalent, inclusive \nof  physical  and  price  contingencies,  and  financial  charges  during  development  (Table  1;               \nAppendix 4 provides details).  \n \nTable 1: Program Investment Plan ($ million) \nItem  Total \nA.

Financing Plan \n \n30.  The Government has requested financing up to an equivalent of $50.0 million from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources to help finance part of the Investment Program. The financing will be \nprovided under a MFF, in accordance with ADB policy.17 The MFF will extend two loans to finance \nProjects 1 and 2 under the Investment Program, subject to the submission of the related PFR by \nthe Government and execution of the related loan and project agreements. The Government has \nentered  into  a  Framework  Financing  Agreement  (FFA)  with  ADB.  The  FFA  satisfies  the \nrequirements  set  forth  in  Appendix  4  of  the  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and  Modalities                      \n(see footnote 17). The Government is required to comply with the FFA requirements. Pursuant to \nthe FFA, the Government has submitted to ADB the first PFR for Project 1 in the amount of                 \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2005.

The loans under the \nMFF will finance civil works, equipment and goods supply and erection, and consulting services. \nThe minimum loan amount of a PFR will be $20 million. All provisions of the ordinary operations \nloan regulations applicable to loans based on the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)18 will \napply to each loan, subject to any modifications that may be included under the individual loan \nagreement. The Government has the option to choose between eligible currencies and the interest \nrate regime for each loan. The specific terms for each loan will be based on the related PFR with \ninterest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility and the \napplicable commitment charge, and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were \nits own independent decision and not made relying on any communication or advice from ADB.  \n \n31.  Financing for each project is inclusive of (i) 20% as equity by HHDC and ZCG; and (ii) the \nbalance  in  the  form  of  a  loan  from  a  domestic  commercial  bank.  The  Government\u2019s  equity \ncommitment is already being fulfilled in Project 1 with the ongoing project construction activities \nbeing financed with equity.

The Borrower of the ADB loan for each project under the Investment Program will be PRC, \nand the loan proceeds will be re-lent from the Ministry of Finance to GPG and then to ZCG. ZCG \nwill relend the loan proceeds to the relevant PIA, through an onlending agreement on the same \nterms and conditions as those of the individual loans. The foreign exchange and interest variation \nrisks will be borne by the relevant PIA.     \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n33.  GPG will be the Executing Agency responsible for overall implementation of the Investment \nProgram. For each project of the Investment Program, HHDC will establish a legally independent \nPIA in line with the Company Law to implement the relevant project. For Project 1, EHC was \n                                                 \n18 ADB. 2001. Ordinary Operations Loan Regulations Applicable to LIBOR-Based Loans Made from ADB\u2019s Ordinary \nCapital Resources. Manila.  \n ", "10  \nestablished in November 2004. The organizational structure of the Project companies will be based \non commercial principles and in accordance with the relevant PRC laws and regulations. The PIAs \nwill coordinate and monitor all project implementation activities. A project director, directly reporting \nto  the  president  of  HHDC,  will  be  responsible  for  overall  project  management,  approval  of \ncontracts, and payments. A project implementation unit (PIU) established within each PIA will \nfacilitate land acquisition, social and environmental protection measures, and ensure that project \ndevelopment issues are adequately addressed. The PIU will be headed by a project manager \nresponsible for physical implementation of activities on a day-to-day basis and the preparation of \nprogress reports. To strengthen the PIU capabilities in complying with safeguard issues, and in \nproject monitoring, control and reporting, the PIU will be assisted by a team of international and \nnational  consultants.  An  organization  chart  for  implementing  the  Investment  Program  is  in \nAppendix 5.  \n \n34.  To  facilitate  national  approvals,  land  acquisition  and  licensing  arrangements,  and  to \naddress environmental and social safeguard issues related to the Investment Program, ZCG has \nformed  a  lead  group  consisting  of  representatives  from  ZCG\u2014Finance  Bureau,  Development \nPlanning and Reforms Commission, Land Bureau, and Environment Protection Bureau. The lead \ngroup is headed by a vice mayor of ZCG. The group will act as a focal point at the city level to \nassist the PIA to implement the Investment Program.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n35.  The Investment Program will be implemented over a period of 7 years from 2006 to 2012. \nFor  Project  1,  preconstruction  activities,  such  as  detailed  design,  preparation  of  bidding \ndocuments,  prequalification  of  contractors,  and  tendering  and  award  of  contracts  began  in        \nmid-2006.  On-site  preconstruction  works  started  in  July  2006.  Main  civil  works  will  start  in            \nJanuary 2007 and will take about 26 months. The anticipated completion date is February 2009. \nOverall, Project 1 is expected to be completed by January 2010. For Project 2, preconstruction \nactivities will start in October 2007. Civil works will start in February 2008 and will take 30 months \nto complete. Project 2 construction will be launched in February 2008, and is anticipated to be fully \ncommissioned in August 2012. The implementation schedule of the Investment Program is in \nAppendix 6. \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n36.  All ADB-financed procurement will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. Civil works and \ngoods under each project of the Investment Program will be properly packaged in accordance with \nthe Procurement Guidelines. Civil works contracts costing $10 million or more and each goods \nsupply contract costing $1 million or more financed by ADB will be procured through international \ncompetitive  bidding  (ICB)  procedures  using  ADB\u2019s  standard  bidding  documents.  Civil  works \ncontracts costing less than $10 million will be procured through national competitive bidding (NCB). \nGoods supply contract packages costing $100,000 to $1,000,000 will be procured either using \nNCB, or in exceptional circumstances with the prior approval of ADB, limited international bidding \nprocedures. Goods supply contract packages costing less than $100,000 will be procured using \nshopping procedures. The contract packaging and procurement modes for each contract will be \nexamined during ADB's processing of PFRs, and will be finalized during loan negotiations for each \nProject. The PIAs will engage tendering companies, which are well qualified to perform these tasks \nand  have  previous  experience  in  other  externally  funded  projects,  to  assist  in  carrying  out \nprocurement activities. The relevant sections of ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy will be included in all \ndocuments and contracts during bidding for and implementation of each project. Based on the \nimplementation schedule of each project, a procurement plan will be prepared. The Procurement \nPlan for the Investment Program and Project 1 is in Appendix 7.  \n \n ", " 11\n4.  Consulting Services \n \n37.  International  and  national  consultants  financed  under  the  Investment  Program  will  be \nrecruited  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants.  Services  will  be \nprovided through a firm or individuals recruited and engaged through international competition \nprocedures using the quality- and cost-based selection method. For Project 1, consulting services \nare estimated to be 2 person-months international and 10 person-months domestic. For Project 2, \nthe requirement of consulting services will be submitted for ADB review as part of the project \nappraisal report, before to the submission of the second PFR.  \n \n5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n38.  The  individual  loan  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement  Handbook 19  and  ADB\u2019s  Interim  Guidelines  for  Disbursement  Operations,          \nLIBOR-Based Loan Products,20 both as amended from time to time.  \n \n6.  Advance Contracting and Retroactive Financing \n \n39.  In  June  2006,  the  PIA  for  Project  1  engaged  a  tendering  company 21 to  manage  \nprocurement  for  ADB-financed  civil  works  and  goods.  The  tendering  company  has  started \npreparation of bid documents, tendering, and bid evaluation. In view of the advanced stage of \nproject preparation, the Government has requested ADB\u2019s approval for advance contracting for \ncivil works and goods. The Government has also requested retroactive financing of up to 20% of \nthe loan amount for each individual loan.  \n \n40.  ADB management approved (i) advanced contracting for civil works and goods, and (ii) the \nrequest to seek ADB Board approval for retroactive financing for the PFRs under the MFF\u2014up to \n20% of the proceeds from individual loans under the MFF\u2014provided that expenditures are incurred \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines or Guidelines on the Use of Consultants during \nthe  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the  corresponding  individual  loan  agreement  and  loan \neffectiveness under the MFF subject to management approval on a per tranche basis. Retroactive \nfinancing is sought for eligible expenditures including civil works, goods, and consulting services \nthat  have  long  lead  time  and  are  critically  required  at  the  start  of  construction  activities,  for \nexample, diversion structures, headrace tunnel, hydromechanical equipment, powerhouse civil \nwork associated with embedded structures. The Government has been informed that approval of \nadvanced contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the projects.  \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n41.  The accounting, internal control, and reporting systems and procedures for PIAs will follow \nthe accounting principles and practices prescribed by the Accounting Law of the PRC, which \nrequires enterprises to prepare financial statements and generally follow international accounting \nstandards. Each PIA will maintain separate accounts of its operations and submit to ADB audited \nproject accounts and agency financial statements, including a management letter, in English not \nlater than 6 months after the end of the financial years. The submitted project accounts and agency \nfinancial statements should be of acceptable quality and should be subject to an independent audit \nby the provincial or municipal audit bureau, or an external auditor acceptable to ADB. The audits \nwill be carried out in accordance with PRC\u2019s audit regulations and will meet ADB\u2019s requirements. \nFinancial  statements  with  adverse  opinions  or  disclaimers  from  auditors  are  considered \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2001. Loan Disbursement Handbook. Manila. \n20 ADB. 2002. Interim Guidelines for Disbursement Operations, LIBOR-Based Loan Products. Manila. \n21 It  is  a  mandatory  national  requirement  to  engage  one  of  the  accredited  tendering  companies  for  all                     \nforeign-financed projects.   \n ", "12  \nunacceptable and cannot be submitted for this purpose. The Government, GPG, and the PIAs \nhave  been  informed  about  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  submission  of  audited  financial  statements  and \npossible penalties for delays in submission.  \n \n42.  The PIAs through GPG will also submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use \nof individual loan proceeds, project implementation, imprest account, and the performance of the \nPIAs. The reports will include (i) quarterly progress reports on project implementation, including \nbrief monthly updates; and (ii) a project completion report for each project not later than 3 months \nafter completion of the relevant project facilities. In addition, HHDC/PIAs will provide ADB with \nreports on contract management procedures (including approval of variation orders and progress \npayment certificates). \n \n43.  During the Investment Program midterm review, financial projections of HHDC and each of \nthe PIAs for the following 5 years will be submitted to ADB for its review. Reports on proposed tariff \nincreases, benefit monitoring, and other relevant activities have to be submitted to ADB within the \ntime stipulated in the individual loan and project agreements. \n \n44.  Anticorruption Measures. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government, Gansu and the PIA. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Investment \nProgram. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin the loan regulations and the bidding documents for projects under the Investment Program. In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Investment Program will include \nprovisions specifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of PIAs and \nall contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Investment \nProgram.  \n \n45.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. A project performance management \nsystem (PPMS) was developed by the project preparatory TA consultants and agreed to by GPG, \nZCG, and PIAs. The PPMS includes a set of measurable indicators covering project design, \nimpacts, and risks. The macroeconomic and sector performance, institutional capacity, and reforms \nwere taken into account in designing the monitoring indicators. It included environmental and \nsocioeconomic indicators. Each PIA will establish an environmental and resettlement management \nunit (ERMU) to coordinate environmental and resettlement management issues associated with \nindividual  project  implementation.  The  units  will  oversee  environmental  and  resettlement \nmanagement  and  monitoring  during  construction  and  operation,  including  environmental  and \nresettlement supervision of contractors. During implementation, the implementation consultants \nand ERMU will help PIAs monitor project impacts, and will keep ADB informed of implementation \nprogress  with  the  environmental  management  plan  and  resettlement  plan  through  quarterly \nprogress reports.  \n \n46.  Program Review. In 2009, ADB, GPG, ZCG, and the PIAs will carry out a midterm review \nof  the  Investment  Program,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative,  organizational,  technical, \nenvironmental,  social,  poverty  reduction,  resettlement,  economic,  financial,  and  other  relevant \naspects that may have an impact on the performance of the Investment Program and its continuing \nviability. The midterm review will thoroughly examine progress in sector reforms, and evaluate \ncompliance with warranties and representations of the FFA, and assurances in individual loan \nagreements. Loan review missions will also be fielded regularly at least once every year to assess \nimplementation. The implementation progress report will be submitted to the Board at least once a \nyear. A supplemental progress report for Project 1 will be submitted prior to the management \napproval of individual loan agreements for Project 2. A loan inception mission will be fielded within \n3 months of the individual loan approval. The PIAs will prepare a project completion report for each ", " 13\nindividual project. In addition, ZCG and GPG will prepare an Investment Program completion report \nat the completion of Project 2.   \n \nIV.  INVESTMENT PROGRAM BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \n47.  During  preparation  of  the  Investment  Program,  Project  1  was  appraised  on  technical, \neconomic,  financial,  environmental,  and  social  issues.  A  detailed  appraisal  report  has  been \nsubmitted to ADB. For Project 2, a similar appraisal report will be prepared by ZCG and GPG. The \nproject preparatory TA consultants will assist PIA and GPG in preparing this appraisal report, which \nwill be submitted to ADB for review before the second PFR is submitted.  \n \n48.  The Investment Program is based on a least-cost generation expansion plan in Gansu. \nSome indicative financial, economic, social, and environmental analyses of Project 2 were carried \nout based on its prefeasibility studies and are discussed below. The integrated benefits and \nimpacts are expected to outweigh the costs. \n \nA.  Economic Analysis \n \n49.  The  demand  forecast  methodology  uses  the  bottom-up  approach  or  sector  analysis \nmethod. Different end-use demands\u2014primary (agriculture), secondary (industry and construction), \ntertiary (including commercials and services), and residential (urban and rural)\u2014were calculated \nbased on current economic activities, policies, and impact of recent major construction projects in \nGansu. Regression method was used for projecting electricity demand. The regression model used \nelectricity  tariff,  GDPs,  population,  industry  structure,  and  energy  efficiency  as  independent \nvariables. Historical data for 1990\u20132004 was taken as input to the regression model. The estimates \nof the regression models (144 TWh) closely matched GPG forecast (129 TWh).  \n \n50.  Because of the large gap between demand and supply and a high growth rate of demand in \nZhangye  and  the  Hexi  corridor,  the  demand-side  responses  were  not  considered  as  full \nalternatives  in  the  analysis.  Only  supply-side  options\u2014new  generating  plants\u2014were  used  as \navailable options. The least-cost generation planning for the Gansu provincial power network up to \n2020 was completed under an advisory TA22 in 2002, and the model was updated with actual data \nfor 2002\u20132005. The analysis was also expanded to include the remaining three HPPs in the \nscheme. The least-cost analyses confirmed the robustness of the Investment Program and the \nscheme. The least-cost model optimized the objective function of minimum total system cost\u2014\ncapital costs, operations costs, and other external cost\u2014to meet the power demand within the \ndefined reliability criteria. The least-cost model (i) confirmed the projects under the Investment \nProgram to be the least-cost options for additional generation capacity in Gansu, (ii) confirmed the \nInvestment Program benefits as incremental electricity supply, and (iii) identified coal-fired power \nplants as the alternatives. Appendix 8 gives the least-cost generation planning and analysis. \n \n51.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for Project 1 was calculated to assess its \neconomic viability. Costs considered were capital costs, and operation and maintenance costs. \nAppropriate conversion factors were used to convert financial values into economic values. Values \nare expressed in 2006 local currency. The quantified benefits of Project 1 considered in the \neconomic analysis included incremental energy supply through willingness-to-pay. This yielded an \nEIRR of 19.60%. The economic analysis of Project 1 (Appendix 9) does not include environment \nimprovement and social benefits. The EIRR calculation is a conservative approach, as it takes into \naccount only the main benefits but includes all project-related costs. Sensitivity and risk analyses \nsimulating adverse scenarios were carried out, and the EIRR was found to be stable and robust.  \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for Preparing the Gansu Hydropower Project \n(Financed from the Japan Special Fund). Manila (TA 3730-PRC, approved on 27 September, for $950,000). \n \n ", "14  \n52.  For Project 2, the detailed EIRR calculations will be carried out per ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nEconomic Analysis of Investment Projects to prove its economic viability, as per the requirements \nof the selection criteria and approval procedures of the agreed-upon FFA.  \n  \nB.  Financial Analysis  \n \n53.  Individual projects under the Investment Program will be implemented by separate PIAs. \nHHDC is the parent company for both PIAs. This separate project entity approach is considered \nprudent  as it  (i)  brings  transparency,  improves  accountability  and  corporate  governance;  and          \n(ii) ensures a task force approach to project development, providing management focus. The PIAs \nare separate legal entities but have intimate relation with each other and the parent company \n(HHDC) in terms of management practices, procedures, and management styles. For Project 1, \nEHC was registered as a limited liability company under PRC law in November 2004. Being a new \ncompany, the financial management capacity and projections of the parent company were also \nreviewed in detail.  \n \n54.  The  review  of  HHDC  financial  management  capacity,  and  practices  indicates  that  the \ncurrent systems, policies and standards, and training programs on general accounting and finance \nmeet good national and international practices. HHDC has fully implemented the recommendations \nmade under the advisory TA (footnote 22) and a subsequent ongoing Loan (footnote 6). HHDC has \ncomplied with all the financial management covenants of the loan. The audited financial statements \nof HHDC show that the company\u2019s financial condition is robust. Its net profit has gone up steadily \nfrom 9% of sales in 2002 to 30% in 2005. Its financial position is also sound with its capital \nstructure comprising 40:60 total liabilities to equity. The company retains all its earnings to finance \nits ongoing projects. Its accounts receivable level is equivalent to less than 2 months of sales, \nalthough its current ratio is low as capital expenditures are presently funded through payables to \nsuppliers  (in  addition  to  internal  cash  generation  and  other  cash-raising  initiatives)  pending \nconclusion  of  the  long-term  loans  being  arranged.  The  historical  and  projected  financial \nstatements, as well as the key financial indicators are presented in Appendix 10. \n \n55.  The retail and power plant output tariffs in the PRC are regulated. They are fixed by the \nprice bureau of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and, in the case of \npower  plants,  are  announced  at  the  start  of  the  year  for  units  beginning  their  commercial \noperations during the year. In line with the ongoing sector reforms in the PRC, the retail tariffs are \nbeing  unbundled  into  generation,  and  transmission  and  distribution  tariffs.  The  fundamental \nprinciples of full cost recovery, and adequate return on equity and investment are firmly embedded \nin the sector tariff formulation for over a decade now and have been consistently applied, which \nreduces the risk of approval of a nonviable tariff for the Investment Program. A regulated tariff of \nCNY0.228/kWh has been fixed by NDRC for 2006 for all new HPPs in Gansu. This regulated HPP \ngeneration tariff is lower than the regulated tariff of CNY0.248 for coal-fired power plants. The tariff \nis then indexed to the consumer price index. The Investment Program financial analysis is based \non this regulated HPP tariff. This is a conservative approach, as it takes into account only the \ngeneration tariff, but includes transmission line costs up to the nearest grid substation.  \n \n56.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and financial net present value (FNPV) were \ncalculated  for  Project  1.  The  potential  carbon  revenues  were  not  included  in  the  base  case \ncalculation. The FIRR is 5.8%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) estimated \nat 4.2%, and the FNPV is CNY63.3 million at this WACC. Project 1 is considered financially viable. \nSensitivity analysis shows that the FIRR is robust under various adverse conditions. Inclusion of \ncarbon revenues up to 2012 at a conservative estimate, results in significant improvement in FIRR \n(6.8%) and FNPV (CNY94.1 million). The financial analysis is in Appendix 11. \n ", " 15\n57.  For  Project  2,  the  detailed  financial  analysis  will  be  carried  out  per  ADB\u2019s  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects23 to clearly demonstrate its financial viability, which is a \ncritical factor in the selection criteria and approval procedures of the agreed-upon FFA.  \n \nC.  Environmental Benefits and Impacts \n \n58.  The Investment Program will have significant positive environmental benefit from avoided \nair pollution, which will have local, regional, and global benefits. System planning and least-cost \nanalysis concluded that the alternative would be coal-fired thermal power generation. Based on \nthis alternative, the estimated avoided annual emissions from the Investment Program are 260 t \ntotal suspended particulate; 2,100 t SO ; 1,550 t NO . On completion, the Investment Program will \n2 x\neliminate the use of 1 million t of coal per year of operation. The HPP will improve the efficiency \nand reliability of the electricity supply in the project area. It will provide an option to burning coal \nand biomass for cooking, with associated improvements in indoor air quality. The Investment \nProgram will also prevent annual emissions of an estimated 382,000 t CO  with associated global \n2\nbenefits of reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  \n \n59.  Individual projects under the Investment Program are classified as environment category A. \nThe environmental assessment and review procedure (EARP) to guide the preparation of the EIAs \nfor individual projects has been finalized. The EIA for Project 1 under the Investment Program was \nprepared and approved by the Gansu Environmental Protection Bureau in October 2004. A SEIA \nhas been prepared and placed on the ADB website for public disclosure in April 2006. Major \npotential environmental impacts from Project 1 include (i) soil erosion, (ii) impact on flora and fauna \nalong the 10.3 km section of Heihe River with reduced water flow, (iii) protection of the Qilianshan \nNational  Natural  Reserve  (QNNR),  and  (iv)  quality  of  surface  water.  Potential  environmental \nimpacts  have  been  identified  and  measures  developed  to  mitigate  the  impacts.  The  SEIA \nconcluded that the adverse environmental impacts of Project 1 can be minimized to acceptable \nlevels by implementing adequately funded environmental management activities. Project 1 cost \nestimates include the environment protection cost.  \n \n60.  Project 2, which will also be environmental category A, and located in close physical \nproximity with similar level of construction activities, is likely to have similar environment impacts. \nPreparation of the SEIA for Project 2 as per the EARP is part of the representation and warranty \nprovided by the Government under the FFA and will be closely monitored and assessed by ADB. \nThe  SEIA  for  Project  2  will  be  disclosed  on  the  ADB  website  at  least  120  days  before  the \nsubmission of the second PFR. The cost estimates for Project 2 will be closely monitored to ensure \nthat adequate costs are included for the specified environment management system. The EARP is \nincluded as Appendix 12.  \n \n61.  The Heihe river consists of three sections: (i) upper mountain areas fed by precipitation and \nglaciers, (ii) middle oasis area, and (iii) lower arid areas. Environmental degradation in the middle \noasis area and the lower arid areas has been increasing due to large-scale water diversion for \nirrigation and industrial purposes. The increase in water extraction in the middle oasis area is \ncausing water shortages and desertification in the lower arid areas. The proposed Heihe river \ncascade includes seven HPPs located in the upper mountain areas of the river, which will regulate \nflow on a daily basis with only insignificant impact (para. 25) on downstream stakeholders. The \nmain environmental impacts will result from diversion of natural flows from about 45 km along the \nriver flow. Allowance for environmental flow has been incorporated into the individual projects\u2019 \nenvironment management plan. The EIA studies have also indicated that there are only two fish \nspecies in the area of reduced flow, neither of which is endangered or migratory. Project 1 and \nProject 2 are located in the experimental zone of the QNNR. The EIA has identified specific \n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2005.

All \nconstruction activities will be periodically reviewed by the QNNR Administration Bureau.  \n \nD.  Social Benefits and Poverty Reduction \n \n62.  Poverty  Reduction.  The  Investment  Program  is  located  in  Xishui  township  of  Sunan \ncounty of Zhangye. Xishui township has a poverty incidence of about 80%. ADB  has earlier \nsupported Xiaogushan HPP in the scheme (para.12, footnote 6). The projects included in the \nInvestment Program are located very close (within 30 km) to each other and to Xiaogushan HPP. \nUnder the Investment Program, PIAs will implement further measures to enhance benefits to local \ncommunities, including (i) hiring and training local workers for project construction; (ii) allowing \naccess to project facilities (e.g., medical emergency facilities, transportation, electricity supply);          \n(iii)  supporting  purchases  of  local  supplies  and  services  from  the  local  communities;  and                      \n(iv) providing a more reliable electricity supply to local towns after project completion. Sunan \ncounty, an ethnic minority community, will receive operation tax revenue from PIAs, which can be \nused to improve social services and to invest in economic activities to reduce poverty. Following \nthe completion of each project\u2019s construction, ZCG has agreed to provide preferential tax revenue \nallocation to the host county equal to 5% of the tax revenue from power generation. A summary \npoverty reduction and social strategy is included in Appendix 13. \n \n63.  The 11FYP aims to set up 50 green energy demonstration counties24 in the country by \n2010. Sunan is the host county for the Investment Program and the scheme. The construction of \nHPPs  in  the  scheme  has  accelerated  economic  development  of  the  Sunan  county  in  an \nenvironment-friendly manner. It is a demonstration case of how a remote rural area can directly \nbenefit from the development of renewable and clean energy. Considering Sunan\u2019s close fit with \nthe 11FYP key priorities, ZCG and GPG have agreed to consider qualifying it as a green energy \ndemonstration county. If approved by the Government, monetary incentives can further strengthen \nand accelerate Sunan\u2019s economic development.  \n \n64.  Gender  Impacts.  Reliable  and  affordable  electricity  will  bring  a  better  lifestyle  to  the \nhouseholds,  especially  for  the  women,  and  provide  them  access  to  appliances  such  as  \nrefrigerator, television, and mobile phone. Access to the mobile phone service is considered a \nmajor benefit as it enables them to communicate with their husband while they are away from \nhome for herding for about 6 months in a year.  \n \n65.  Land  Acquisition.  A  total  of  2.9 hectares  of  nonirrigated  grassland  was  permanently \nacquired  under  Project  1\u2014Erlongshan  HPP,  which  affected  two  households  or  12  people  in \nLouzhuangzhi village of Xishui Township. A total of 4.73 hectares of nonirrigated grassland has \nalso  been  temporarily  occupied  for  a  maximum  of  3  years  in  Project  1,  which  affected                      \n7 households or 42 people. The PIA has prepared a short resettlement plan (RP) for Project 1. \nPayment to the affected people was completed in December 2005. The resettlement cost was \nCNY76,264, paid directly to the affected people in cash. No complaint has been received from the \naffected people.  \n \n66.  For Project 2, PIA has prepared a summary resettlement framework (RF). Prefeasibility \nstudies and intensive field assessment for Project 2 suggest that land acquisition will be of similar \nmagnitude as in Project 1 and only nonirrigated grassland would be acquired. Preparation of the \nshort RP for Project 2 as per the RF is part of the representation and warranty provided by the \nGovernment under the FFA and will be closely monitored and assessed by ADB. The RF is \nincluded as Appendix 14.   \n \n                                                 \n24 Counties that meet more than 50% of their energy need through clean and renewable energy. Additional tax and \ndevelopment revenues are expected to flow from the Government to \u201cgreen counties\u201d.   ", " 17\n67.  Ethnic Minorities. The projects are located in an area within Xishui Tibetan Township, \nSunan Uygur Autonomous Prefecture, Zhangye City. Over 90% of the population of Xishui Tibetan \nTownship is Tibetan in origin. Over 90% of the rural people are herdsmen. The average income for \nherders in the project area was CNY3,692 per capita in 2002.25 Tibetans in Xishui believe in \nTibetan Buddhism, speak Tibetan language, and are self-identified and identified officially by the \ngovernment. Ethnic relations in the area are harmonious. No sign of ethnic discrimination within the \ncommunity  can  be  detected.  Two  Zang/Tibetan  households  are  affected  by  permanent  land \nacquisition for Project 1. The impacts and mitigation measures are addressed in the RP. Similarly, \nProject 2 will have insignificant impact on ethnic minorities. The impact and mitigation measures \nwill be addressed in the RP of Project 2. \n \n68.  Stakeholders Consultations. During the feasibility study, EIA, land acquisition planning, \nand TA implementation, consultations were conducted with more than 4,400 representatives of \nlocal  government  agencies,  civil  society,  and  project-affected  people  to  discuss  project \nalternatives, environmental concerns, land acquisition issue, and economic development potential. \nThe consultation indicated that local residents overwhelmingly supported the Investment Program \nbecause they will have access to more reliable and affordable electricity and will enjoy other social \nbenefits. The consultation processes also enabled local stakeholders to express their concerns \nsuch as public safety during the construction period, and to make suggestions to improve the \nInvestment Program design and implementation.  \n \nE.  Investment Program Risks \n \n69.  An analysis was conducted to ensure sufficient demand for the electricity generated by the \nInvestment Program. The risk of insufficient demand is minimal. The electricity generated will \ncoincide with the summer peak demand, when electricity shortages are more acute. The regulated \ntariff of CNY0.228/kWh for new HPPs in Gansu reflects the economic supply cost and is expected \nto increase mildly due to fluctuations of the consumer price index. The expected carbon revenues \nfrom CDM transactions will further improve the PIAs\u2019 financial performance without requiring tariff \nadjustments. Strong economic performance is expected in Gansu, based on the PRC\u2019s emphasis \non economic development of the western regions. \n \n70.  The projects under the Investment Program are based on proven designs and conventional \ntechnologies that have been used successfully in the PRC. No significant technical risks are \nanticipated. The hydrological risks that are common to HPPs are minimal as the hydrologic regime \nfor the Heihe river is well known, with data for the last 60 years. The accuracy and reliability of the \nrecorded historical hydrological data were updated and analyzed by the independent consultant \nunder the project preparatory TA (footnote 9). The average (for energy calculations) and extreme \nhigh flows (for flood risk) have been taken into consideration in the design. Geological risks are \nproject specific and have been given particular attention in the projects\u2019 design. Notwithstanding \nthe  PIAs  proven  capacity  to  manage  the  implementation  of  projects,  ZCG  will  minimize  this \npotential risk further by hiring experienced international and national consultants to strengthen the \nPIUs under each PIA in the areas of construction management, and supervision and reporting of \ncompliance  with  safeguards.  Due  to  its  stand-alone  nature,  the  delay  in  construction  or  non \nimplementation of the last HPP, which is not included in the Investment Program, will in no way \naffect the viability of the projects included in the Investment Program.  \n \n71.  The economic analysis of Project 1 suggests no significant economic risk. Sensitivity tests \nand risk analysis show that Project 1 will be economically viable even under a combination of \nadverse scenarios. To fully assess the potential risks, a probabilistic risk analysis was performed \nusing the Monte Carlo simulation technique based on 1,000 simulations for both the EIRR and \n                                                 \n25 The average rural income per capita in Gansu Province was CNY1,852 in 2004 and average GDP per capita in \nZhangye was CNY5,973 in 2002.   \n ", "18  \nFIRR analyses.26 The crucial risk variables were selected because of their significant impact on the \nProject\u2019s economic and financial viability. The results indicate that the expected EIRR, based on \nthe weighted average of all simulated combinations, is 17.8% or about 1.8% lower than the            \nbase-case value. The probability of the EIRR falling below the cut-off rate of 12% is 7%. The \nresults also indicate that the expected FIRR is 5.2%, about 0.8% lower than the base-case value. \nThe probability of the FIRR falling below the WACC for the Project of 4.17% is 11%. \n \n72.   The 110 kV grid substation\u2014a common substation for the Investment Program and the last \nHPP\u2014to pool the evacuated power from the scheme is already under construction and is expected \nto be available by the time of commissioning of the first unit of Project 1. In line with the rural \ndevelopment  emphasis  in  the  11FYP,  GPG  is  committed  to  strengthen  the  rural  power \ninfrastructure. The rural grid improvement project and the uniform urban-rural tariff is a work in \nprogress with strong commitment from the Government. The related assumptions are likely to hold \ntrue.  \n \n73.  Use of a new financing modality, over a 7-year period, poses a risk for both the PRC and \nADB. This was recognized in the design of the project preparatory TA itself. TA implementation \nwas formulated in a phased manner to assist the Government to prepare the requisite documents \nfor both tranches. ADB loan review missions will further strengthen support to the Government \nprior  to  the  submission  of  the  second  PFR.  The  PIAs  and  GPG  are  fully  familiar  with  ADB \nrequirements and have adequate capacity to manage the procurement, comply with safeguards \nand other representations and warranties included in the FFA. The GPG has the capacity and \nwillingness to adhere to framework facility understanding, but may need special assistance in the \nfield. ADB will position itself to give it. The Government has already submitted all the required \ndocuments for the first tranche under the MFF. Appendix 15 illustrates the Investment Program \nand Project 1 readiness.   \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.  Specific Assurances \n \n74.  In addition to the assurances included in the FFA, the Government has given the following \nassurances, which are included in the legal documents: \n \n(i)  Environment. ZCG will cause the PIAs to ensure that (a) the projects are designed, \nconstructed  and  operated  in  accordance  with  national  and  local  environmental \nprocedures  and  guidelines  and  with  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002);  (b)  the \nprojects  are  designed,  constructed  and  operated  in  accordance  with  the \nenvironmental  management  plan  (EMP)  as  reflected  in  the  EIA,  SEIA  and  the \nEARP; (c) the EMP for Project 1 will be updated in accordance with the cumulative \nEIA and the detailed engineering design; (d) the EMP will be incorporated in bidding \ndocuments and civil works contracts; and (e) environmental performance reports will \nbe  submitted  to  ADB  twice  annually  during  the  construction  period,  including \nprogress made on the mitigation measures, monitoring data, problems encountered, \nenforcement plan and any violations.  \n \n(ii)  Land  acquisition.  GPG,  ZCG,  and  PIAs  will  ensure  that  (a)  all  land  and                \nrights-of-way required for each project will be made available in a timely manner;  \n(b)  and  that  the  RPs  agreed  upon  with  ADB  will  be  carried  out  promptly  and \n                                                 \n26 The simulation was carried out using Risk Master computer software. Monte Carlo simulation works by generating a \nseries of random numbers following the distribution of probability of each risk variable. For each simulation, which \nrepresents a combination of different states of risk variables, the economic internal rate of return and financial internal \nrate of return are calculated and recorded. The results of 1,000 simulations are averaged. ", " 19\nefficiently in line with ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary Resettlement and the RF; (c) the \nRPs are updated based on the detailed design, prepared in full consultation with the \naffected persons and disclosed to them prior to submitting the RPs to ADB; (d) the \ncommencement of civil work or a similar milestone will be subject to ADB\u2019s review \nand approval of the RPs for each PFR submitted; and (e) an external consultant \nacceptable to ADB is engaged to carry out monitoring and evaluation and report to \nADB in accordance with the requirements of the RP.   \n \n(iii)  Auditing  and  accounting.  GPG,  ZCG  and  each  PIA  will  ensure  that  proper \naccounts and records are maintained and audited in a timely manner to adequately \nidentify the use of loan proceeds in such manner and detail as may be specified \nunder each Loan Agreement and Project Agreement(s). \n \n(iv)  Water right management. From 2008, ZCG will ensure that a coordinated water \nright  management  plan  for  all  the  HPPs  in  the  cascade  in  Zhangye  will  be \nimplemented and regulated. This action should be closely coordinated with the \nHeihe river basin commission.  \n \n(v)  Change in ownership. If (a) any change in ownership of the project facilities, or            \n(b) sale, transfer, or assignment of PIA\u2019s interest in the project power plant is \nanticipated, the GPG, ZCG, and PIAs will consult ADB at least 6 months before \nsuch change, sale, transfer, or assignment. GPG, ZCG, and the PIAs will ensure \nthat any proposed change in ownership of the project facilities will be carried out in a \nlegal and transparent manner. \n \n(vi)  Tariff. GPG and ZCG shall ensure that the formulated tariff of electricity generated \nby each Project under the Investment Program will be adequate to cover operating \ncosts, maintenance and depreciation, financing cost and allow an acceptable return \non the net fixed asset. \n \n(vii)  Policy change. GPG shall consult with ADB in due course of any changes in power \npricing,  load  dispatch  and  similar  other  policies  that  may  adversely  affect  the \nfinancial viability of each Project under the Investment Program. \n \n(viii)  Financial  performance.  GPG  and  ZCG  will  ensure  that  from  the  start  of \ncommercial operation of each Project, the relevant PIA will maintain (a) a debt \nservice coverage ratio of 1.2; (b) a debt-equity ratio of 80:20; (c) a return of fixed \nasset of 6%; and (d) accounts receivables not exceeding 2 months\u2019 sales. Each PIA \nwill improve the debt service coverage ratio to 1.3 and debt-equity ratio to 75:25 \nwithin 5 years of commercial operation.   \n \n(ix)  Financial governance. ZCG and PIAs will ensure that internal controls of the PIAs \nwill be strengthened and an independent and autonomous internal audit department \nwill be set up in each PIA. The PIAs will adopt acceptable computerized accounting \nand  management  information  systems,  and  prepare  financial  statements  and \nreports in accordance with national accounting standards.  \n \n(x)  Gender. GPG, ZCG and PIAs shall follow the principles of the ADB\u2019s Policy on \nGender and Development during each Project implementation, including taking all \nnecessary actions to encourage women living in the project area to participate in \nplanning and implementing project activities. GPG, ZCG and the PIAs shall monitor \nthe project effects on women during the implementation of the projects, through, \nwhere relevant, gender-disaggregated data collected pursuant to the monitoring and \nevaluation system referred to in the PPMS. \n ", "20  \n(xi)  Sexually  transmitted  diseases.  With  the  assistance  of  the  relevant  local \nauthorities,  GPG,  through  ZCG,  and  PIAs  shall  cause  contractors  to  distribute \ninformation on the risks of sexually transmitted diseases to those employed during \neach Project construction and to the local communities living in the vicinity of each \nProject.  \n \n(xii)  Women and child labor. GPG, through ZCG, and PIAs will ensure that (a) there is \nno differential payment between men and women for work of equal value, and        \n(b)  civil  works  contractors  do  not  employ  child  labor  in  the  construction  and \nmaintenance activities in accordance with the relevant laws and regulations of the \nGovernment.  \n \n(xiii)  Community  development.  ZCG  shall  ensure  that  5%  tax  revenue,  which  it \nreceives from the sale of power generation under each Project will be allocated as \nadditional revenue to Sunan County for their community economic development \npurpose.   \n \n(xiv)  Private sector participation. ZCG will (a) seek development of Bao Pinghe HPP \nthrough private-public partnership, and (b) from 2012 start divesting its shares in \nHeihe Hydropower Development Company. \n \nB.  Conditions for Loan Disbursement \n \n75.  For each individual loan, the Government shall have certified to ADB that the lending \nagreement between ZCG and the relevant PIA are executed in form and substance satisfactory to \nADB. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n76.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  multitranche  financing  facility  would  comply  with  the \nArticles of Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board \napprove the provision of loans under the multitranche financing facility in an aggregate principal \namount not exceeding $50,000,000 equivalent to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Gansu \nHeihe Rural Hydropower Development Investment Program from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, \nwith interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the Framework Financing Agreement presented to the Board.  \n \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n16 November 2006 ", "Appendix 1  21\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks  \n       \nImpact      Assumptions \n       \nEnvironmentally clean  Contribution of clean and  The statistical yearbook of  \u2022  The PRC to remain \npower supply supporting  renewable energy  Gansu Province and the PRC  committed to promote clean \neconomic growth in the  increased from current    and renewable energy. \nrural areas of Gansu  19% to 23% by 2015      \nProvince       \n     \nRural economic growth  Statistical yearbook of Gansu   \u2022 Sound macroeconomic \nsustained at an average    conditions in the PRC and \n6% up to 2015     Gansu will continue. \n     \nMore than 99% villages  Statistical yearbook of Gansu    \nelectrified \n \n       \nOutcome      Assumptions \n       \nReliable, clean, and  50% improvement in rural  Zhangye  power bureau data  \u2022 PRC\u2019s priority on rural \naffordable hydropower  CAIDI by 2012  supported by consumer  development is maintained \nsupplied to rural    surveys at project completion   and supported by adequate \nconsumers in Zhangye      funds allocation. \nCity of Gansu Province        \n     \nUniform urban-rural power  Zhangye tariff schedule   \u2022 Ongoing tariff reforms \ntariffs enforced by 2012     continue; supply cost \n    reductions due to efficiency \n    gains are passed on to the \n    consumers.   \n     \nIncreases in rural power  Zhangye  power bureau data   \u2022 Rural grid improvement \nconsumption from                 projects are implemented.  \n226 GWh to more than     \n300 GWh by 2012  \n       \nOutputs      Risks  \n       \n1.

Description of the Scheme  \n \n1.  The Heihe river is the second largest inland river in the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) and the largest in the Hexi corridor. Traversing more than 800 kilometers (km), the river \npasses through Qinghai Province, Gansu Province, and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. \nThe section from the Huagzhang Temple to the Yingluo Gorge in Zhangye, a 95 km stretch \nalong the river, is an excellent source for hydropower generation. In this area, the average \ngradient in the riverbed is about 10%, corresponding to about 1,000 meters head difference. \nDue to its strategic location in the Hexi corridor,1 an area that has been experiencing chronic \nelectricity shortages due to limited generation capacity and large distances from power plants, \nthe Heihe river hydropower potential has been studied in great detail in the last 50 years.2 The \nHeihe  River  Hydropower  Development  Plan  prepared  in  those  early  stages  had  identified \ncascade hydropower development as the optimum approach, and identified seven potential \ncascade hydropower plant (HPP) sites in the river in Zhangye City, with a total hydropower \npotential of about 645.5 megawatts (MW).   \n \n2.  During the 9th Five-Year Plan (9FYP) in 1995, the development of the Heihe river \ncascade  hydropower  development  scheme  was  identified  as  priority  by  the  Zhangye  city \ngovernment (ZCG) to meet electricity shortages. In 1996, construction of the first HPP in the \nscheme began. In 2003, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved a project loan to finance \nthe 102 MW Xiaogushan HPP, the third project in the scheme. In 2004, an optimization study of \nthe scheme was completed that confirmed the total hydropower potential of 645.5 MW at an \nestimated cost of $575 million.

It is a narrow but long passage stretched  \nfrom east to west of about 900 km from the steep Wushaolin hillside to Xinxinxia gorge at the border of Gansu and \nXinjiang. As part of the Silk Road in ancient China, it is the most important passage to Xinjiang and Central Asia. It \nis sandwiched in between snow-covered Qilian Mountains to the south and north mountain and deserts to the \nnorth. \n2  Northwest Hydropower Design Institute and Gansu Provincial Hydropower Design Institute identified cascade \nhydropower development on the Heihe river in the 1950s.  \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \n3.  The Investment Program will finance the next two HPPs in the scheme: (i) Project 1, \n50.5  MW  Erlongshan,  and  (ii)  Project  2,  60  MW  Dagushan.  ZCG  and  Gansu  provincial \ngovernment (GPG) are committed to complete development of all seven HPPs in the scheme by \n2013.   \n \nB.   Development Impacts of the Scheme  \n \n4.  Enhanced Environment Sustainability. The scheme involves construction of seven \nmedium-sized run-of-river HPPs that have minimal environmental impacts but large positive \nenvironment benefits in terms of avoided air pollution from alternative coal-fired power plants. \nThe avoided annual emissions include 1,560 tons (t) total suspended particulate, 13,200 t sulfur \ndioxide (SO ), 10,200 t nitrogen oxide (NO ). The scheme will also avoid annual emissions of an \n2 x\nestimated  2,300,000  t  carbon  dioxide  (CO )  with  associated  global  benefits  for  reduced \n2\ngreenhouse gas emissions.  \n \n5.  Support for Sustainable Economic Growth. The scheme has started improving the \nefficiency and reliability of the electricity supply in the project area, thus addressing a major \nconstraint to economic growth in Zhangye. The scheme has provided an alternative to burning \ncoal and biomass for cooking, with associated improvements in indoor air quality. The scheme \nhas provided reliable electricity, a vital input to the local agriculture-based industries in Zhangye.  \n \nC.  Relevance of the Scheme to the Sector  \n \n6.  Hydropower Development in Gansu. Nine river systems in the Yellow, Yangtze, and \ninland river drainage basins with an annual discharge of 61.4 billion cubic meters are the main \nwater  resources  in  Gansu  province.  The  combined  hydropower  potential  is  estimated  at            \n17 gigawatts (GW). The province has constructed 32 hydropower stations with a total installed \ngenerating capacity of about 4 GW and an annual output of 12 terrawatt-hours. The share of \nHPP has declined sharply from 41% in 2000 to about 19% in 2005 because of the recent \naddition of coal-based generation capacity. In Gansu, hydropower potential is mainly in small to \nmedium-sized HPPs in mountainous areas.3 Development of small- and medium-sized HPPs is \na  local  government  responsibility.  Their  development  is  generally  constrained  by  the  local \ngovernment\u2019s  financing  capacity.  Private  sector  investment  in  hydropower  development  is \nlimited to large hydropower projects developed by major power utilities. GPG has drawn an \nextensive plan for local hydropower development to double the present capacity of 4 GW to \nabout 8.5 GW by 2020. In the 11FYP, GPG aims to add about 2 GW of hydropower capacity. In \nthe absence of innovative approaches to project financing and private sector participation, the \naccelerated development of hydropower in Gansu will be severely restricted.  \n \n7.   Sector Priorities. The 11FYP focuses on optimized electricity sector development with \nemphasis on accelerated development of renewable energy, improvement of energy efficiency \nby 20%, and strengthening of rural infrastructure to address the imbalance between urban and \nrural income levels. Gansu is one of the key provinces identified in the 11FYP to promote \nrenewable energy development. One of GPG\u2019s main development objectives is to improve air \nquality  standards  in  all  cities.  Development  of  renewable  energy  sources  and  suitable \nhydrothermal generation mix are priorities in achieving that development goal. GPG also aims to \nachieve 100% electrification of rural areas through development of renewable energy-based \ngrid and off-grid connections.    \n                                                 \n3  In the PRC, hydropower plants less than 50 megawatts are classified as small; 50\u2013300 MW are classified as \nmedium-sized. ", "Appendix 2  25\n8.  The  scheme  is  an  integral  part  of  the  electricity  system  planning  and  least-cost \ngeneration capacity expansion plan in Gansu. The scheme is consistent with the Government\u2019s \nsector  priority  on  (i)  development  of  clean  and  renewable  energy,  (ii)  strengthened  rural \ninfrastructure to minimize urban and rural electricity service gaps, and (iii) energy efficiency. The \nscheme  will  provide  electricity  closer  to  a  large  group  of  consumers  in  the  Hexi  corridor, \nobviating the need to transmit electricity over a long distance, thus improving efficiency. The \nscheme  will  complement  rural  electricity  grid  rehabilitation,  a  key  rural  infrastructure \ndevelopment need. The HPPs in the scheme are eligible for carbon revenues under the clean \ndevelopment mechanism (CDM). So far, the only project in the scheme that has successfully \ncontracted carbon revenues is the ADB-financed 102 MW Xiaogushan hydropower project. \nUnder the Investment Program, the marketing of carbon revenues from potential clean energy \nproject has been institutionalized. Project 1 is being considered as the pilot for the Carbon \nMarket Initiative (CMI).  \n \nD.   Poverty Reduction Impact \n \n9.  The Investment Program is located in Xishui township of Sunan county of Zhangye. \nXishui has a poverty incidence of about 80%. Before the construction of the scheme, the local \ncommunity had unreliable landline telephone, did not have access to cellular phone services, \nand had only a dirt road leading to the nearest township. Due to poor road condition, the bus \nservice was infrequent (only once a week); it used to take more than 8 hours to reach Zhangye. \nThe construction of HPPs have resulted in the improvement of 78 km of rural roads and a daily \nbus service to Zhangye, the travel time has been reduced from 8 to 4 hours providing improved \naccess  to  markets,  hospitals,  etc.  In  addition,  project  implementing  agencies  (PIAs)  will \nimplement further measures to enhance benefits to local communities, including (i) hiring and \ntraining  local  workers  for  project  construction;  (ii)  allowing  access  to  project  facilities              \n(e.g., medical emergency facilities, transportation, electricity supply); (iii) supporting purchases \nof local supplies and services from the local communities; and (iv) provision of more reliable \nelectricity supply to local towns after project completion. Sunan county, an ethnic minority \ncommunity, will also receive operation tax revenue from PIAs, which can be used to improve \nsocial services and to invest in economic activities to reduce poverty. Following the completion \nof each project\u2019s construction, ZCG has agreed to provide preferential tax revenue allocation to \nthe host county equal to 5% of the tax revenue from power generation.  \n \nE.  Policy Framework and Capacity  \n \n10.  In April 2002, the PRC power sector reform plan was issued. It aimed to introduce \ncompetition for efficiency improvements, reduction of costs, implementation of a market-based \npricing  mechanism,  optimal  resource  allocation,  nationwide  grid  connection,  separation  of \ngovernment and commercial functions. During the 10FYP, significant progress was made\u2014\npower plants were separated from grid, five independent generation companies and two grid \ncompanies were formed, the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) was established \nin October 2002, aiming to introduce competitive power markets for power generation. Regional \nwholesale power markets are being piloted in the northeast, central, eastern, and southern \nregions. Progress made in the sector reform policies is expected to continue and intensify in the \n11FYP. However, in line with the plan\u2019s priority on rural development, the sector policies have \nbeen aligned to (i) minimize imbalance between urban and rural electricity services (ii) achieve \nuniform urban-rural tariffs and (iii) improve access to electricity in unserved rural areas.     \n \n11.  The  11FYP  highlights  the  strategic  significance  of  diversifying  energy  supply  by \nproviding increasing renewable energy including small hydropower, wind, solar, geothermal \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \npower,  and  bioenergies.  The  Renewable  Energy  Law  promulgated  in  2006  has  prioritized \nrenewables in the energy development strategy. The law and its accompanying regulations \nhave  provided  enabling  conditions\u2014tax  and  tariff  incentives  and  a  regulatory  framework\u2014        \nto promote renewable energy in the country. A medium- and long-term renewable energy \ndevelopment plan is under preparation and is expected to be issued by the end of 2006. It is \nexpected that the renewable energy will contribute about 120 GW of the estimated 700 GW of \nthe new capacity that will be added by 2020.  \n \n12.  ADB has been supporting renewable energy development in Gansu since 2002 and has \nmade targeted interventions in Zhangye to pilot new technologies, approaches, and financing \nmechanisms. ADB\u2019s ongoing support (Table A2.2) has strengthened the institutional capacity of \nGPG, ZCG, and PIAs to plan, design, and implement the Investment Program. Capacity building \nof the PIAs in areas of (i) safeguard compliances\u2014planning, monitoring and reporting; and            \n(ii) seeking carbon revenues under CDM has been carried out in parallel with the preparation of \nthe Investment Program. Based on the ongoing engagement of ADB in Gansu and Zhangye \nand a review of its institutional capacity under the project preparatory technical assistance,4 it \ncan  be  concluded  that  ZCG,  GPG,  and  PIA  are  competent  and  financially  capable  of \nmaintaining and managing the whole scheme.  \n \nTable A2.2: ADB Support to Gansu Province in Development of Clean  \nand Renewable Energy   \nYear   Details of Assistance \n2001  TA 3730-PRC: Preparing Gansu Hydropower Project ($950,000)   \n2002   TA 3840-PRC: Clean Development Mechanism in the Energy Sector\u2014Gansu was one of \nthe four targeted provinces ($775,000)  \n2003   Project Loan 2032-PRC: Gansu Clean Energy Project ($35 million)  \n2003   TA 4309-PRC: Renewable Energy for Poverty Reduction ($600,000) \n2006  TA 4783-PRC: Preparing Gansu Heihe Hydropower Development Project ($500,000) \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006.

External sources, including foreign direct investment, are increasingly being promoted \nand now finance about 20% of the total annual investment in the energy sector of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), mainly in the power sector. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has \napproved $3.5 billion for the PRC energy sector to finance 28 projects in the public sector, and  \n2 private sector power projects. Of the projects, thermal power projects account for 41% in \nterms  of  loan  amount,  with  hydropower  projects  accounting  for  about  36%,  followed  by \ntransmission  and  distribution  (about  17%),  and  renewable  energy  (about  6%).  ADB  has \nextended five loans amounting to $665 million for hydropower and pumped storage power \nprojects  in  the  PRC.1  Of  these  three,  two  have  been  completed,  both  with  the  rating  of \n\"Successful.\u201d \n \n2.  ADB has also provided 100 technical assistance (TA) projects for the energy sector \ncosting about $50 million to help prepare projects, provide policy advice, and build institutional \ncapabilities of power utilities that are the executing agencies of ADB loans. ADB provided TAs \nto  help  restructure  the  power  sector,  formulate  power  pricing strategy,  improve  the  power \nplanning process, and establish the State Electricity Regulatory Commission. TAs provided by \nADB also covered clean production,2 energy conservation,3 and environmental management.4 \nADB  is  providing  TA  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  efforts  on  energy  efficiency.5  The  TA\u2019s \nobjective  is  to  help  the  Government  identify  various  options  for  developing  a  policy  and \nregulatory framework to promote and implement efficiency power plant projects. 6  \n \n3.  The World Bank is an important source of external funding for the power sector. Since \nthe early 1990s, it has provided over $6.2 billion to finance 25 projects, most of which are            \nlarge-scale thermal and hydropower projects, and power transmission and distribution projects. \nIn  recent  years,  the  World  Bank  has  provided  loans  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  urban \nenvironmental improvement and development of renewable energy. The World Bank has also \nprovided TAs on power sector restructuring and heating sector reforms. The United Nations \nDevelopment Programme is also providing assistance to help the Government evaluate various \noptions for power sector restructuring and for promoting energy conservation.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1993.

Among bilateral sources, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is the \nlargest source of external assistance for the PRC\u2019s power sector. It has provided concessional \nloans totaling CNY438 billion ($3.6 billion at the current exchange rate) for 14 power sector \nprojects through its official development assistance window. JBIC has also provided special \ncredits to major cities to improve their environment by installing emission control devices and \nequipment in power plants and factories, and by building water treatment facilities. JBIC is \nconsidering shifting its traditional focus of assistance in the power sector from hydropower and \nthermal power generation to energy conservation and renewable energy, particularly in the \nwestern  region.  German  development  cooperation,  through  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau \n(KfW), has provided approximately $400 million in mixed credits, mostly for power plants and \nturbine modernization projects. KfW also supported the Government in energy efficiency and \nrenewable energy development. Other bilateral sources providing export credits or mixed credits \nin the energy sector include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom, \nand United States. \n \n5.  ADB has established a working relationship with the World Bank in addressing policy \nissues and coordinating lending and TA operations, and exchanges views with bilateral sources \nand the private sector. Both ADB and the World Bank emphasize the importance of improving \nthe management of power utilities, tariff reform, energy efficiency improvement, environmental \nprotection, and a greater role for the private sector. During the processing of the Investment \nProgram, discussions were held with the World Bank, JBIC, and KfW to ensure that their \nrespective activities are complementary and to maintain consistency in policy advice.  \n \nB.  Lessons  \n \n6.  ADB\u2019s overall experience with energy and environment sector projects in the PRC has \nbeen positive. Projects are generally well-designed and smoothly implemented, although front \nend delays have occurred in some projects. Success is attributed to extensive preparation prior \nto ADB intervention, high sense of local ownership, effective leadership in project management \noffices, and timely policy and enterprise reforms. Delays have also occurred for some projects in \nloan  signing  and  loan  effectiveness,  as  well  as  in  procurement,  construction,  and \ncommissioning, but in most cases have not led to unsatisfactory performance. The Government \nhas implemented reforms on investment regulations, which simplify approval procedures and \ndelegate some approving functions to authorities at the local governments. ADB has been \nworking closely with the Government to harmonize the two approval procedures to minimize \nproject start-up and implementation delays.   \n \n7.  Power utilities, particularly small and medium ones, have been found to be weak in the \narea  of  commercial  and  financial  management.  Often,  there  is  a  need  for  institutional \nstrengthening in the areas of organizational structure, delegation of authority, management, \ninformation and control systems, accounting and financial management, and human resource \nmanagement.  Project  completion  and  project  performance  audit  reports  for  ADB-financed \nprojects in the PRC highlight (i) the need to improve financial reporting; (ii) the need for more \nattention to environmental matters; (iii) the advisability of using larger boiler-turbine units; and \n(iv) the necessity for capacity building, not only for project preparation, but also for staff training  \nin operational and managerial aspects of power utility operations. Recently, some ongoing \npower projects in the PRC experienced implementation delays in meeting procurement and \nconstruction deadlines mainly because of the ongoing restructuring of the power sector and ", "Appendix 3  29\nconsequent change in the ownership of the projects. Nevertheless, the overall implementation \nperformance of ADB\u2019s energy portfolio in the PRC is satisfactory.7 \n \n8.  Ongoing reforms on power tariffs are encouraging increased use of renewable energies, \nincluding wind, solar, small and medium hydropower, and bioenergies. The retail and power \nplant output tariffs in the PRC are regulated. They are fixed by the price bureau of the National \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC)  and,  in  the  case  of  power  plants,  are \nannounced at the beginning of the year for units commencing their commercial operations \nduring the year. In the ongoing sector reforms in the PRC, the retail tariffs are being unbundled \ninto generation, and transmission and distribution tariffs. The fundamental principles of full cost \nrecovery, and adequate return on equity and interest are firmly embedded in the sector tariff \nformulation for over a decade now and have been consistently applied. The project completion \nreport on the two completed hydropower projects8 revealed that the tariff approved were lower \nthan the appraisal estimate. However, the approved tariffs were still consistent with the average \nincremental economic cost (AIEC) of hydropower plants. It suggests that a careful approach \nbased on more rigorous analysis of tariff-setting guidelines and ongoing reforms should be \nfactored in the estimated tariffs, so that the project financial viability can be ascertained under \nthe most likely scenario.  \n \n9.  Some hydropower projects (footnote 1) have also had substantial loan cancellations due \nto  cost  savings.  The  reason  was  that  cost  estimates  were  made  on  international  pricing \nstandards with a high level of contingencies, which in most cases were not utilized. Some  \ncommitment charges were avoidable. There should be a more careful examination of all cost \ncomponents and a review of historical costs for similar projects in the PRC, together with a \nproactive approach in identifying cost savings and prompt loan cancellations.  \n \n10.  These  lessons  were  taken  into  account  in  the  Investment  Program  design  and \npreparation. During the preparation, lessons of experience were addressed by (i) thoroughly \nreviewing project readiness on key factors that may potentially delay the start-up; (ii) careful \nassessment  of  institutional  capacity  and  strengthening  measures  to  improve  the  level  of \ncorporate governance; (iii) conservative estimates of the expected tariff consistent with the \nexisting policies and reform agenda; (iv) undertaking rigorous review and sensitivity analysis of \ncash flows, and financial and economic analyses; and (v) setting up of project implementing \nunits with autonomy in operations and for procurement decisions.

General  \n \n1.  The Gansu power network is part of the north-west power network, located in the west \ncentral region of the People\u2019s Republic of China. It connects to Qinghai in the west, Shanxi in \nthe east, and Ningxia in the north, with transmission lines covering an area of 390,000 square \nkilometers and serving about 25 million people. The portion of the Gansu network west of the \nYellow River is known as the Hexi grid. The Zhangye power network is part of the Hexi network. \nThe proposed hydropower plants (HPP) in the Heihe river cascade hydropower development \nscheme\u2014(i)  50.5  megawatts  (MW)  Erlongshan  HPP,  (ii)  60  MW  Dagushan  HPP,  and               \n(iii) 112 MW Bao Pinghe HPP\u2014will be connected to the Zhangye, Hexi, and Gansu network \nthrough a 110 kilovolt transmission grid substation in Zhangye. The assumption is that the total \noutput of these HPPs will be used to meet demand within Gansu province and all (or a major \npart) of its generation will be consumed within the Zhangye and Hexi network.  \n \n2.  A least-cost generation planning for the Gansu provincial power network was completed \nunder an advisory technical assistance in 2002.1 The least-cost analysis model developed under \nthat technical assistance was updated with the actual data for the year 2003\u20132005. The analysis \nwas also expanded to include the remaining three HPPs in the scheme.  \n \nB.  Demand Forecast \n \n3.  Electricity demand forecasts play a key role in generation planning since the level of \nfuture demand is one of the critical variables in selecting the least-cost power plant. A review of \nthe actual electricity demand during the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001\u20132005) in Gansu revealed \nthat the electricity demand far exceeded the conservative assumptions of 5.7% per annum \naverage growth estimated earlier. The recently observed elasticity of electricity consumption \nwith respect to income and the recent economic performance of Gansu suggests that the \nelasticity (percent increase in electricity consumption to per cent increase in gross domestic \nproduct [GDP]) has been about 1.2 to 1.3.  \n \n4.   The demand function also considered the 11 Five-Year Plan (11FYP) priority of the \nGovernment to reduce energy intensity2 by 20% and a sustained annual average economic \ngrowth of about 7%. A regression analysis was performed to assess compounded annual \ngrowth rate (CAGR) based on the elasticity of electrical demand at about 1.1 and GDP growth \nof 7 %. The time series data for 1995\u20132004 was used in estimating long-term growth rate. The \nresulting demand projections are in Table A8.1.  \n \n5.   Zhangye electricity demand growth (average about 13% since 2001) has also outpaced \nits  economic  growth  (average  about  10%).  The  11FYP  priority  on  rural  development  and \nZhangye\u2019s recent demand growth were considered in estimating the demand projection for \nZhangye (Table A8.2).      \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

The Erlongshan, Dagushan, and \nBao Pinghe HPPs are expected to start generation in 2010, 2012, and 2013, respectively.

The Zhangye network has two comparable but distinct peak demand scenarios, winter \nand summer. The summer peak imposes maximum demand on the existing network. The \nsummer demand is made up of a larger peak mainly due to agricultural (pumped irrigation) load. \nThe projects in the Heihe river cascade scheme\u2014Erlongshan, Dagushan, and Bao Pinghe\u2014 \nwill provide maximum generation during summer months when river flows are higher, which \nmake them particularly suited to alleviate the peak electricity demand gaps in the Zhangye \nnetwork. \n \nC.  Least-Cost Analysis \n \n8.  Because  of  the  large  gap  between  demand  and  supply  in  Zhangye,  demand-side \nresponses were not considered as full alternatives in the analysis. Only supply-side options\u2014\nnew  generation  plants\u2014were  used  as  viable  options.  Considering  the  consistent  large          \ndemand-supply gap, it was concluded that the HPPs in the scheme will provide the incremental \nelectricity supply to the network.  \n \n9.  Project  Alternatives.  Four  project  alternatives  using  three  power  generation \ntechnologies\u2014hydropower,  coal-fired,  and  natural-gas-fired\u2014have  been  considered  for \nchoosing the least-cost option. Two fossil-fuel generation technologies were considered as \ntechnology alternatives: 300 MW coal-fired thermal, and combined-cycle gas turbine (CCGT, \n300 MW). Technology alternatives, including Xiaogushan Hydropower Project, were analyzed in \ndetail. Capital and annual operation and maintenance costs for each technology alternative \nwere examined. The capital cost used in the analysis excluded physical contingency and taxes.  \n \n10.  For direct comparability, the output of each alternative was normalized. Adjustments \nwere also made for load factor differences. It was assumed that aside from the benefit for \ncapacity substitution for HPPs, the alternatives would generate more energy (load factor is \naround 68%) to substitute generation from coal-fired plants. The latter could not be used to \nmeet incremental demand, but would save fuel consumption in existing plants, bringing energy \nsaving benefits. The capital costs used in the analysis excludes transfer payments such as \ntaxes as well as provisions for physical contingency. Unlike the hydropower alternative, other \nproject alternatives involve use of depletable resources such as coal and natural gas. Valuation \n ", "38  Appendix 8 \nof depletable resources requires the inclusion of an explicit opportunity cost component for \ndepletion, in addition to the marginal extraction cost or the normal domestic market price. This \nopportunity cost is referred to as the depletion premium. The depletion premium for coal was \ncalculated to be CNY194 per ton (t), in addition to the extraction cost of CNY248/t. For natural \ngas, the depletion premium was estimated to be CNY104 per t of coal equivalent.  \n \n11.  Identifying the Least-Cost Option. The least-cost option was selected by comparing \nthe cost of the selected project alternatives, which are the mutually exclusive and technically \nfeasible options to supply the projected demand. Average incremental economic cost (AIEC)3 \nfor each option was calculated to determine the option with the lowest AIEC. The HPPs in the \nscheme were the least-cost option with an estimated AIEC of CNY0.22 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) \ncompared with CNY0.29/kWh for a coal-fired power plant, and CNY0.49/kWh for a combined-\ncycle gas-fired power plant.  \n \n12.  The equalizing discount rate\u2014the discount at which the present value of two life-cycle \ncost streams are equal, thus indicating a discount rate at which preference changes\u2014shows \nthat hydropower remains a better alternative up to the discount rate of 16%, after which the \ncoal-fired power plant will be preferable. Hydropower, with its high capital costs and very low \noperational cost, is the preferred option when lower discount rates are used.  \n \nD.  Conclusions \n \n13.  The major conclusions of the least-cost analysis follow: (i) the HPPs in the scheme will \nsupply the incremental demand; (ii) the HPPs in the scheme are the least-cost option; and                     \n(iii) a coal-fired power plant is the alternative to the HPPs in the scheme. \n                                                 \n3  Ratio of present value of incremental investment and operation costs, with- and without-project alternatives, and \npresent value of incremental output, with- and without-project alternatives.

The economic analysis was carried out for Project 1, Erlongshan Hydropower Plant with \ncapacity  of  50.5  megawatts  (MW).  Economic  costs  are  at  2006  constant  prices  and  are \nexpressed in domestic currency. Tradable commodities were valued at border prices at the \nprevailing exchange rate. Nontradable commodities were valued through shadow prices using a \nstandard conversion factor of 0.987, and specific conversion factors: 1.0 for equipment, 1.67 for \nsteel, 0.76 for cement, 0.82 for timber, 2.0 for skilled labor, and 0.67 for unskilled labor. The \ncapital costs were also adjusted to eliminate price inflation, interest during construction, and \ntaxes. \n \nB.  Estimation of Benefits \n \n2.  The main economic benefit of Project 1 is power generation to meet the electricity \ndemand  of  end  users.  Analysis  used  conservative  estimates  of  the  actual  benefits\u2014lower \nforecast for generation, plant use of 1%, and transmission and distribution losses of 9.5%, \nformed  the  basis  for  the  incremental  net  energy  supply  from  Project  1  to  the  end  users.        \nProject 1 with its 50.5 MW installed capacity is assumed to provide about 155 gigawatt-hours \nper year to end users, which represents about 35% load factor or an average load of about   \n17.7 MW.  Incremental benefits were quantified based on end users\u2019 willingness-to-pay (WTP). \n \n3.  Economic benefit was calculated using a semilog electricity demand function. Consumer \nsurplus\u2014the difference between what one is willing to pay for a commodity and the amount one \nis actually required to pay\u2014was estimated as CNY0.77/kilowatt-hour (kWh), using a semilog \nfunction.1 The WTP for Project 1 was calculated by deducting the incremental cost of distribution \nand transmission. A benchmark figure of CNY0.16/kWh was used to estimate the incremental \ntransmission and distribution cost. The final result of CNY0.61/kWh was used for all economic \nbenefit calculations.  \n \nC.  Estimation of the Economic Internal Rate of Return \n \n4.  The basis for project evaluation is a comparison of benefits and costs between the      \nwith-project (base) case and the without-project (alternative) case. The project analysis period is \n24 years following expected full operation by 2010. The project construction period is 4 years, \nbeginning  in  2006  to  the  end  of  2009.  The  economic  internal  rate  of  return  (EIRR)  was \ncalculated at 19.6%, indicating that Project 1 is economically viable (Table A9.1).  \n \n5.  A complete quantification and estimation of all benefits from the Project was not possible \ndue to various factors including time and resources. Thus, the total benefits estimated in this \nanalysis can be interpreted as conservative estimates. There are large positive environmental \nbenefits from the avoided pollution\u2014the annual emission of 120 tons (t) particulate matter, 955 t \nsulfur dioxide (SO ), 750 t nitrogen oxide (NO ), and 183,000 t carbon dioxide (CO )\u2014from an \n2 x 2\nalternative  energy  source  (a  coal-fired  thermal  power  plant).  Among  these  environmental \nbenefits, the most prominent ones are (i) improved human health from avoided morbidity and \nmortality from fine particulates, (ii) improved  human welfare due to improved visibility and \nreduced  damage  to  materials  from  avoided  air  pollution,  and  (iii)  positive  impacts  on \nenvironmental resources due to avoided emission of carbon dioxide. However, these benefits \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2002. Measuring Willingness-to-Pay for Electricity (ERD Technical Note 3).

To complement the above deterministic analysis, risk analysis was performed using a \nprobabilistic approach to the perceived risk factors that affect the viability of Project 1. The \nselected  risk  variables  included  capital  cost,  energy  sales,  commissioning  year,  foreign \nexchange rate, and WTP. A total of 1,000 simulations were made. Based on the weighted \naverage of all simulated combinations, the expected EIRR (without environmental benefits) of \nthe Project is 17.32% with a standard deviation of 4.61%. This is only 2.28% points lower than \nthe base value without consideration of project risks.  \n \nE.  Conclusions  \n \n8.   The  economic  analysis  verifies  that  Project  1  is  sustainable.  It  was  estimated  that  \nProject 1 has a net present value of CNY161.73 million. This quantification is based on a WTP \ntariff of CNY0.61/kWh and an energy use of 155 gigawatt-hours by end users.

This Appendix analyzes the historical and projected financial performance of the parent \ncompany, Heihe Hydropower Development Company, Limited1 (HHDC). The projected financial \nperformance of Erlongshan Hydropower Company (EHC), the project implementation agency \n(PIA) for Project 1, is in its Appraisal Report.  \n \nA.  Financial Performance \n \n2.  HHDC is a state-owned enterprise, established in September 2000 by merging four \nsmall hydropower plants (HPPs) and other related businesses. Currently, there are five HPPs \nmanaged by HHDC. Xiaogushan and Longgu No.1 power plants are owned by HHDC with \nmajority shares, while power plants Longqu No.2, Longqu No.3, and Yingke used to be fully \nowned by HHDC, but recently, part ownership of these assets was sold to HHDC staff to raise \nequity for the Xiaogushan and Erlongshan projects. The combined balance sheets, income \nstatements, and cash flow statements of HHDC were audited by the Audit Bureau of Zhangye. \n \n3.  HHDC experienced double-digit revenue growths from the operations of its four small \npower plants in 2001 through 2003, primarily due to the increasing demand for electricity. \nDuring 2004\u20132005, power generation was stable since capacity utilization already reached the \nmaximum.  The  tariff  for  the  four  small  HPPs  increased  in  2006  from  CNY0.16  per            \nkilowatt-hour (kWh) to CNY0.18/kWh. The gross profit margin and consequently, net profits, \nincreased continuously over the last 5 years due to higher revenues coupled with improved \nproduction efficiency and management practices. The company\u2019s net profit went up steadily \nfrom 3.6% of sales in 2001 to 30.2% in 2005. Return on net fixed assets increased from 0.6% in \n2001 up to 9.7% in 2005; the return on equity increased from 0.4% to 4.9% during the same \nperiod. \n \n4.  Both  the  interest  coverage  ratio  and  debt  service  coverage  ratio  were  satisfactory \nbecause debt gearing is low, indicated by the total debt-to-equity ratio of below 40:60 and a \nlong-term debt-to-total-capitalization of less than 20%. This indicates that the company has \nenough capacity to handle further borrowing. The company retains all its earnings and flows this \nback to finance its ongoing projects. The self-financing ratio was high and sufficient to cover \ncapital expenditures. \n \n5.  The accounts receivable level is equivalent to less than 2 months of sales. The current \nratio however, was below 1. This is seen as temporary due to advances obtained from the staff \nfor the construction of the staff\u2019s residential apartments. After completion, the apartment units \nwill  be  given  to  the  staff  and  the  liability  will  be  offset. In  general, the  historical  financial \nperformance of HHDC was robust and its financial position is sound. \n \n6.  HHDC\u2019s future financial performance will be greatly influenced by the operations of the \nXiaogushan Hydropower Project (XHP),2 which is now being commissioned, and the Erlongshan \nHydropower Project, which is under Asian Development Bank (ADB) evaluation. These projects \nare assessed to be financially viable and would result in additional financial benefits to HHDC. \nThe impact of the operations of the Dagushan hydropower project has not yet been analyzed, \nand is not included in the financial projections. \n \n \n                                                 \n1  Heihe Hydropower Development Company is the parent company of Xiaogushan Hydropower Company and \nErlongshan Hydropower Company. It will also be the parent company of the project company that will be created \nfor Dagushan hydropower project. \n2  Xiaogushan Hydropower Project with a capacity of 102 megawatts is being developed under ADB Loan 2032-PRC.  \n ", "      Appendix 10   43\nB.  Assumptions Used in Financial Projections \n \n7.  HHDC holds over 50% of Xiaogushan Hydropower Company\u2019s (XHC) and EHC\u2019s equity, \nand  as  such  it  can  present  consolidated  financial  statements  using  the  equity  method  of \ncorporate accounting. The projected consolidated income statement for HHDC over the next          \n10 years was prepared on the basis of the actual figures of the current small plants and \nprojected figures for XHC and EHC. All the results from the power plants are consolidated into \nthe total financial projection for HHDC. The company\u2019s financial position and performance will \nstrengthen over time. \n \n8.  For the balance sheet projection, it is assumed that the operating assets of the existing \nplants will not change significantly, while the increase in total assets will be predominantly due \nto XHC and the Investment Program. The retained earnings of all the power plants will also be \ncombined into HHDC\u2019s total. Over 10 years, it is projected that total asset value will grow         \nfive times compared with that in 2005.  \n \nTable A10: Financial Performance and Projections \nHeihe Hydropower Development Company, Limited \n  Actual    Projected \nYear ending December 31  2001  2004  2005    2006  2009  2010 \nFinancial Accounts (CNY million)             \nOperating Revenues  15.91   22.06  21.99   62.42   117.40   131.79  \nNet Operating Income  0.87   5.72  7.75   23.90   51.79   65.07  \nNet Income after Tax  0.57   4.87  6.64   9.32   17.90   21.93  \nTotal Assets  185.52   187.83  229.19   999.52  1314.31  1306.04 \nNet Fixed Assets  96.03  61.98  68.57   822.68  1044.37  1000.68 \nAccounts Receivables  4.74   2.68  3.51   2.80   5.20   7.60  \nCurrent Assets  17.15   11.48  33.74   19.96  83.05  118.47 \nCurrent Liabilities  23.84  40.03  59.81   59.81  84.84  75.22 \nLong-Term Liabilities  29.34   29.27  33.22   693.26   891.24   870.66  \nTotal Liabilities  53.18  69.30  93.03   753.07  976.08  945.89 \nEquity  132.34  118.53  136.16   246.45  338.23  360.15 \nNet Internal Cash Generation  5.77   15.67  10.92   36.72   86.95   100.19  \nFinancial Ratios             \nOperating Ratio a (%)  81.90  65.20  57.20  61.70  55.90  50.60 \nReturn on Net Fixed Assetsb (%)  0.60  7.90  9.70  5.40  5.90  6.40 \nCurrent Ratioc (times)  0.70  0.30  0.60   0.33  0.98  1.57 \nAccounts Receivables d (months)  3.60  1.50  1.90   1.00  1.00  1.00 \nDebt/(Debt & Equity) Ratioe (%)  0.20  0.20 0.20  0.74  0.72  0.70 \nDebt Service Ratiof (times)  2.90  2.50  3.70   2.68  1.67  1.49 \nCNY = yuan.         \na  Total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues.         \nb  Net operating income after taxes as a percentage of rate base.         \nc  Current assets to current liabilities.         \nd  Number of month\u2019s sales in accounts receivables.         \ne  Ratio of long-term debt to long-term debt plus equity.         \nf  Ratio of internal cash generation to debt service requirement.         \nSources: Company financial statements and Asian Development Bank estimates.         \n ", "44  Appendix 11 \nFINANCIAL ANALYSIS \n \nA.  General \n \n1.  This appendix describes the notes and assumptions used in the financial analysis of  \nProject 1, Erlongshan Hydropower Project. The analysis was prepared in accordance with the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines for the Financial Management and  Analysis of \nProjects.1 All costs are expressed in constant 2006 prices. The economic life of the Project is \nestimated at 25 years with no residual value.  \n \n2.  The financial analysis of Project 2 will be carried out using the principles, methodology, \nand guidelines adopted for the analysis of Project 1, as detailed below, to clearly demonstrate \nits financial viability, which is a critical factor in the selection criteria and approval procedures of \nthe agreed-upon Framework Financing Agreement.   \n \nB.  Capital Cost, Benefits, and Operation and Maintenance Costs \n \n3.  The capital cost includes the base cost of all the hydropower plant\u2019s generation facilities, \nincluding the investment cost for the associated transmission facilities ($1.7 million or 4.2% of \nbase  cost).  It  also  includes  physical  contingencies,  but  excludes  price  contingencies  and \nfinancial charges during development. \n \n4.  The benefits from Project 1 will be derived from the sales of electricity generated by the \npower plant based on the projected yearly net generation level (68.9 gigawatt hours [GWh]) in \n2009;  137.8  GWh  in  2010;  and  172.2  GWh  from  2011)  and  the  calculated  tariff  of               \nCNY0.248. The applicable tariff corresponding to the investment for the associated transmission \nand distribution facilities could not be determined and therefore was not included in calculating \nthe financial internal rate of return (FIRR). \n \n5.  Operation and maintenance costs include personnel salaries and welfare costs, plant \nand reservoir maintenance costs, administration, insurance, taxes, and other expenses. \n \n6.  Net cash flows from the Project were determined after income taxes. The income tax \nwas calculated based on the 15% preferential rate for 10 years and 33%, thereafter. \n \nC.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n7.  The FIRR of Project 1 was calculated as shown in Table A11.1. The FIRR is 5.8%, \nhigher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) estimated at 4.2%, and the financial \nnet present value (FNPV) is CNY63.3 million at this WACC. The project is considered financially \nfeasible. Inclusion of benefits2 under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) will improve the \nFIRR to 6.8% and the FNPV to CNY94.1 million. The financial viability of the subproject was \nsubjected  to  sensitivity  analysis.  Sensitivity  analysis  shows  that  the  FIRR  is  robust  under \nvarious adverse conditions (Table A11.2). \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

Introduction \n \n1.  This environmental assessment and review procedure (EARP) has been prepared for \nthe  proposed  Gansu  Heihe  Rural  Hydropower  Development  Investment  Program                        \nin Gansu Province, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The Investment Program proposes to \nutilize the multitranche financing facility (MFF). The Project will consist of the construction of two \nhydropower  plants  (HPPs)  within  the  boundary  of  the  Heihe  river  cascade  hydropower \ndevelopment  scheme  in  Gansu.  Two  sites  have  been  proposed  for  financing  under  the \nInvestment Program: (i) Project 1, Erlongshan HPP; (ii) Project 2, Dagushan HPP.  \n \n2.  It  is  anticipated  that  both  projects  in  the  Investment  Program  will  be  classified  as \nenvironmental  category  A  in  accordance  with  the  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and  the \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB).           \nProject 1\u2014Erlongshan HPP has been formally categorized as environmental category A. An \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) and a summary EIA (SEIA) have been prepared for \nProject 1. Environmental category has yet to be assigned to Project 2, Dagushan HPP. This \nEARP has been prepared to guide the Executing Agency (EA) and the project implementation \nagency  (PIA)  in  the  environmental  assessment  of  projects  included  under  the  Investment \nProgram so as to ensure compliance with environmental safeguard requirements of Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB).  \n \nB.  Overview of Type of Schemes To Be Assessed \n \n3.  This EARP is to be applied for development of both projects constructed under the \nInvestment Program. Details of the projects are described below: \n \n(i)  Project  1,  Erlongshan  HPP.  This  project  includes  a  50.5  megawatts  (MW)           \nrun-of-river  hydropower  facility  (2x20  MW  and  1x10.5  MW  units)  and                        \n38.6 kilometers of 110 kilovolts transmission line. Erlongshan HPP will provide \nbase-load  electric  power  generation  with  annual  electricity  generation  of                  \n174  gigawatt-hours.  There  will  be  no  dam  construction  or  impounded  water \nreservoirs associated with the Project.  \n(ii)  Project 2, Dagushan HPP. This Project includes a 60 MW hydropower facility \nwith a 14.5 meters high diversion weir that will allow for daily flow regulation, and \na proposed reservoir of approximately 0.6 million cubic meters. The Dagushan \nHPP will have an annual electricity generation of 236 gigawatt-hours and is \nlocated directly downstream of Project 1.  \n \nC.  Specific Procedure of Environmental Assessment To Be Used  \n \n1.  Responsibilities,  Authorities,  and  Procedure  for  Environmental \nAssessment of Projects \n \n4.  Responsibilities and Authorities. The Gansu provincial government (GPG) will be the \nEA for each project and will have overall responsibility for ensuring that all applicable PRC and \nADB  environmental  standards  and  procedures  are  followed.  The  Heihe  Hydropower \nDevelopment Company (HHDC) will construct and operate each project by creating a PIA. Prior \nto construction of each Project, HHDC will set up an environmental management unit (EMU) \nthat  will  be  responsible  for  environmental  management  during  construction  and  operation, \nincluding environmental supervision of contractors. The EMU will supervise implementation of \nthe  environmental  management  plan  and  environmental  monitoring  plan.  The  construction \ncontractor  at  each  project  will  designate  an  environmental  representative,  who  will  be \n ", "48  Appendix 12 \nresponsible  for  the  environmental  management  of  construction  activities  during  project \nconstruction.  The  EMU  will  be  responsible  for  overall  environmental  supervision  of  the \ncontractors\u2019 activities. \n \n5.  Environmental  Categorization.  During  initial  project  assessment,  the  EMU  will \ncomplete the ADB Environmental Categorization form for each new project and submit it to ADB \nfor approval. Procedures and forms for completion of Environmental Categorization are included \nin  the  ADB  Environmental  Assessment  Guidelines,  2003,  available  on  the  ADB  website \n(http://adb.org/documents/Guidelines/Environmental_Assessment/default.asp). \n \n6.  Environmental  Assessment.  The  PIA  will  prepare  an  EIA  for  each  project  in \naccordance  with  the  Law  of  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  on  Environmental  Impact \nAssessment, 2003 and associated regulations. For an ADB category A project, the PIA will \nprepare an SEIA document. The Implementing Agency (IA) will ensure that the EIA and SEIA \ndocuments  comply  with  ADB  environmental  safeguard  requirements,  as  detailed  in  the \nEnvironment  Policy  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank,  2002  and  the  ADB  Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines, 2003. The PIA will submit the EIA and SEIA documents to ADB for \nreview  and  approval  before  implementation  of  the  project,  the  SEIA  document  must  be \ndisclosed on the ADB website for 120 days prior to submission of the periodic financing request \n(PFR). The SEIA for Project 1 has been completed, and may be used as a template for              \nProject 2. It is available at http://adb.org/Documents/Environment/PRC/39652-PRC-SEIA.pdf on \nthe ADB website. The PFR for Project 2 will include a safeguard compliance status report for \nProject  1.  In  case  any  major  noncompliance  is  identified,  a  corrective  action  plan  will  be \nprepared and submitted together with the PFR.  \n \n  2.  Environmental Criteria for Project Selection \n \n7.  The  following  environmental  criteria  will  be  utilized  when  screening  for  selection  of \nhydropower projects: \n \n(i)  The proposed projects will be HPP, located within the Heihe river catchment \nbasin. \n(ii)  The projects will not be located in either the core zone or the buffer zone of the \nQilianshan National Natural Reserve.  \n(iii)  Each project must be designed, constructed, and operated in accordance with \nrelevant national environmental laws and regulations. \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangement and Monitoring Program \n \n8.  Environmental  Management  Plan.  The  EIA  for  each  project  will  include  an \nenvironmental management plan (EMP). The SEIA document will include a summary EMP. The \nPIA will ensure that the SEIA (including the summary EMP), the full EMP (included in the EIA \nreport), and the soil erosion control plan (included in the water and soil conservation report) are \nincluded  in  all  contractor  bidding  documents  and  construction  contracts.  The  EMU  will  be \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  EMP  and  the  soil  erosion  control  plan  during  project \nconstruction and operation. The EMU will ensure that the EMP is updated periodically during \nconstruction and operation, as required. The EMU will ensure that the EMP is updated, as \nrequired, based on the cumulative EIA. \n \n9.  Environmental Monitoring Plan. The EIA for each project will include an environmental \nmonitoring plan and the SEIA document will include a summary environmental monitoring plan. \nThe EMU will (i) ensure the environmental monitoring plan is included in all contractor bidding \ndocuments and construction contracts; (ii) ensure that the environmental monitoring plan is \nupdated, as required, during project construction and operation; (iii) coordinate all environmental \n ", "      Appendix 12   49\nmonitoring activities; and (iv) submit environmental monitoring reports (including physical data) \nto GPG and ADB twice annually during construction. The environmental monitoring plan for the \nfirst tranche (Erlongshan hydropower project) will be updated in accordance with the findings \nand recommendations of the Heihe river cascade hydropower development cumulative EIA, \nwhich  is  being  prepared  under  the  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA).1  The \nmonitoring reports will include details in implementing the environmental monitoring plan as \nrequired.  \n \nE.  Staffing Requirements  \n \n10.  Domestic  environmental  consultants  will  be  engaged  to  undertake  the  following \nactivities; (i) assist in preparing the EIA to ensure ADB environmental safeguard policies and \nprocedures are incorporated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environment Policy and Environmental \nAssessment Guidelines; (ii) prepare the SEIA document; (iii) submit the translated EIA and \nSEIA to ADB for review, as required, and incorporate ADB comments; and (iv) identify and \nprovide  necessary  environmental  training  to  the  EMU  and  local  government  officials.  For  \nProject 2, consulting services of 4 person-months have been allocated in the project preparatory \ntechnical assistance. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2006.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People\u2019s Republic of China: \nThe proposed Multitranche Financing Facility (MFF) for the Hehei river cascade hydropower development scheme \nconsists of Erlonghan Hydropower Project (Project 1), Dagushan Hydropower Project (Project 2), and another possible \nproject. Zhangye city has been facing chronic electricity shortages for several years due to low installed generation \ncapacity in the city and large distances from the main power plants of Gansu Province. The frequent interruptions of \nelectricity supply have been a major factor inhibiting the economic development of Zhangye. The power shortages are \nanticipated to become more acute based on the projected growth of demand. The accelerated implementation of \nhydropower plants on the Heihe river cascade scheme is a key priority of the Zhangye city government in its  \n11th Five-Year Plan (11FYP) to meet part of the expected electricity shortage in an environment-friendly manner. \nB.  Poverty Analysis         Targeting Classification: General intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nBasic Socioeconomic Profile in the Project Area \nThe Investment Program is located in Qilian Mountains near Gansu\u2019s southern border with Qinghai province. The run-of-\nriver diversion scheme will be in Xishui township of Mati district in Sunan Yugu Autonomous county, Zhangye city, \nGansu province. In Xishui, Luzhuangzi village will be the site of the Project 1 weir. The electricity generated by the \nInvestment Program is connected to the Zhangye power grid of the Hexi Corridor grid.  \n \nGansu is ranked second lowest among 31 provinces in terms of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita (CNY5,898 \ncompared with the national average CNY10,533) in 2004. Zhangye has five counties (Shandan, Mingle, Linze, Gaotai, \nand Sunan) and one district (Ganzhou) with a total population of 1.268 million, more than 76% of whom are classified as \nrural. Almost 30% or 293,000 of the rural population have incomes less than the national rural poverty line of CNY1,100. \nThe average income for farmers and herders in Sunan county where the Investment Program is located is CNY3,692 per \nperson  (provincial  poverty  line  for  herder  is  CNY1,650).  In  the  Investment  Program  area,  the  main  causes  of \neconomically  undeveloped  are  related  to  the  harsh  natural  conditions,  which  include  high  altitude  \n(1,350 to 2,500 meters) which limits diversification of income opportunities. The directly affected population lives in \nLouzhuangzhi village and Bajiaowan village of Xishui township, with a combined population of 674. The villagers depend \non herding sheep and smaller numbers of other livestock (such as yak, horse, donkey, mule, and goats) in steep dry \nmountain grasslands. Less than 10% of the labor force has nonagricultural livelihoods. A majority (67.8%) of households \ndepended  entirely  on  livestock  and  livestock  products  for  direct  consumption  and  sales  incomes.  There  were  \n15,800 livestock, of which 2,100 were large animals (yak, cow, horse, mule, and donkey) and 13,700 sheep and goats. \nThe Investment Program will bring the following benefits in the area. \n \nIncreased Host County\u2019s Tax Revenue. The Investment Program host county will receive tax revenue of about  \nCNY4 million per annum from the Project Implementing Agency (PIA) during the construction period and will receive \npreferential tax revenue allocation (5% for tax revenue from power generation under the Investment Program) from \nZhangye city government.  \n   \nImproved Rural Infrastructure in Host County \nBefore the construction of Xiaogushan (also ADB Loan-2032-PRC) and Project 1 of Heihe company, Xishui township \nhad unreliable land line telephone, no cell phone tower, and only one dirt road to the nearest township. It took more than \n8 hours to go to Zhangye by bus with only one bus running each week. The 78 kilometers of rural road was improved \nbecause of construction  in the  Xiaogushan  project and another  30 kilometers  extended  and improved  with the \nconstruction of Project 1. Now, local rural people travel only half the time to Zhangye for marketing, shopping, and \naccessing the hospital, and buses operate everyday. Also, the telephone line is not interrupted anymore and cell phones \nare in use. \n \nCreated Employment Opportunity under the Investment Program  \nIt is estimated under the 4-year construction period that the Investment Program will create employment opportunities at \na peak level of over 3,000 persons. In the operation stage, about 60 persons would be employed. It is estimated that \neach unskilled worker can earn CNY5,600 per year, assuming one worker works 280 days/year and earns CNY20/day, \nwhich is more than 3 times higher than the provincial poverty line for herders (CNY1,650). The Investment Program also \noffers the local villagers huge opportunities for daily commerce, trading, and other businesses to increase their cash \nincome during the construction period and also normal operation time.  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 13  51\nFacilitate Local Social Development in the Investment Program Area \nThe Investment Program will enhance the quality of life of people by providing reliable and affordable electricity supply \ngenerated by clean energy. The PIA will implement additional measures to benefit local communities, including (i) hiring \nand training local workers for project construction; (ii) allowing access to project facilities (e.g., medical emergency \nfacilities, transportation, electricity supply); (iii) supporting purchases of local supplies and services for the local \ncommunities; and (iv) providing a more reliable electricity supply to local townships after completion of the Investment \nProgram.  \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nRural and urban populations of the Zhangye grid, Heihe company, and the local government are identified as Investment \nProgram stakeholders.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nDuring preparation of the Investment Program, Heihe hydropower company undertook public meetings with local officials \nand village leaders. The meetings raised the level of awareness, gained local support, and enabled affected people to \nvoice opinions and suggestions for the Investment Program design and implementation. The participatory approach was \ninitiated during the Investment Program design and is an ongoing activity that will be continued during Investment \nProgram implementation. The poor and women have been carefully considered in conducting participatory activities.  \nD.  Gender Development  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nReliable and affordable energy brought a better lifestyle to the households, especially for the women, and enabled them \nto purchase and use refrigerators, televisions, and mobile phones. Access to the mobile phone will allow them to better \ncommunicate with their husbands when the latter are absent from home for 6 months for herding. \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nE.

Compensation Standards \n \n1.  Land Compensation \n \n3.  For  permanent  land  acquisition,  land  compensation  and  resettlement  subsidies  are \ncalculated in accordance with local regulations and the average annual output value (AAOV) in \nthe past 3 years. \n \n4.  Households that have housing or commercial plots affected by the Project will have the \noption to receive replacement land nearby or cash compensation. For permanent land loss, all \nagreed compensation, including land compensation and resettlement subsidies, will be paid by \nthe Project to the Township Land and Resources Office. Then, the Township will make direct \npayment either to the village committee or the affected household, or both, depending upon the \ncompensation option agreed upon. \n \n5.  For  temporary  land  occupation,  the  Project  will  make  payment  directly  to  affected \npersons based on average annual yield of different types of cultivated lands or grasslands. The \ncompensation fee will be 10 times the AAOV for the number of production seasons between \nwhen the land is taken and when it is restored in productive condition. The Project is expected \nto  occupy  the  land  for  maximum  3  years.  The  Project  will  restore  the  land  to its  original \ncondition. \n \n6.  The compensation for green crops that could not be harvested due to permanent or \ntemporary land acquisition will be paid by the Project directly to the affected individuals at the \nmarket value for the mature crop. \n \n2.  House Relocation \n \n7.  For demolished houses and other structures, the affected household is entitled to full \nreplacement value of lost structures (including labor cost and without depreciation or deduction \nof salvage materials). The village will provide the affected household a comparable or better \nhousing plot, site leveling, registration fees, restoring infrastructure (latrines, drainage, electricity \nand water connections) and transition allowances (for moving, damages, lost work time, medical \ncosts).  \n \n8.  The above compensation will be paid directly to the affected household/owner. The \naffected households will rebuild their houses by themselves (or by contract) with compensation \nreceived and construction materials from their old houses. For those vulnerable households, the \ntownship will provide assistance in house rebuilding. \n \nD.  Criteria and Eligibility for Compensation \n \n9.  The compensation and rehabilitation will be provided  for  all  affected persons under the \nfollowing  conditions:(i)  if  their  land  area  or  income  source  will  be  removed  due  to  land \nacquisition of the project; (ii) if their houses (or residential plots) will be demolished or partly \ndamaged due to the land acquisition; and (iii) if their other properties (crops, trees, and other \nfacilities) or access to these properties will be removed or damaged due to land acquisition or \nconstruction of the project. Lack of legal paper of all affected persons\u2019 customary rights of \noccupancy certificates shall not be an obstacle for obtaining compensation for them.

Particular attention is to be paid to the needs of vulnerable \n ", "56   Appendix 14 \ngroups among those displaced: especially those below the poverty line, the elderly, women and \nchildren, indigenous groups and ethnic minorities. \n \nE.  Resettlement Budget \n \n10.  The cost of potential land acquisition and resettlement will be included in the total project \ncost. A detailed cost estimate of the compensation and resettlement will be developed and \nincluded  in  the  Resettlement  Plan  (RP).  The  project  owner  will  make  funds  available  for \nimplementing land acquisition and resettlement, and will be responsible for any cost overrun. \nThe minimum contingencies have to be 10% of total estimated resettlement cost.  \n \nF.  Consultations and Grievances \n \n11.  During the preparation of subprojects, extensive consultation will be carried out by the \nproject owner and concerned local governments with affected people and villages, regarding the \npotential resettlement impacts, compensation policies, and rehabilitation measures as well as \ngrievance procedures. The affected people are invited to voice their opinion on the project, and \nparticipate in land measurement survey. A copy of the survey result will be given to the affected \nhouseholds. After preparation of the RP with detailed compensation standards and rehabilitation \nmeasures, they will be disclosed to the affected people and villages. The public disclosure of the \nRP could be carried out by holding meeting, putting up notice in the affected villages and \ndistributing resettlement information booklet to the affected people.  \n \n12.  Complaints and grievance procedures for land acquisition in the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina are well established. Grievances will first be lodged with the village committee. If no \nsettlement is reached within 2 weeks, the complainant has 1 month to elevate the grievances to \nXishui  Township  Government  of  Sunan  County.  If  the  question  is  still  unresolved  within              \n2 weeks, the case can be sent to and settled by negotiation at the Project Implementing Agency \n(PIA) Office.  \n \nG.  Institutional Arrangements \n \n13.  The PIA is responsible for preparing both the Chinese and English versions of the RP \nupon completion of the land measurement survey and will submit it to ADB within 1 month from \nland measurement survey for review and approval. Once ADB approves the RP, the PIA will \nimplement it in accordance with the provisions stated herein as well as the relevant local laws.  \n \n14.  The  PIA  will  assign  one  resettlement  officer  to  deal  with  implementation  of  land \nacquisition and liaise with affected households and other relevant government offices. Local \ngovernments  (Sunan  Grassland  Management  Office  and  the  township  government)  are \nresponsible for carrying out the formal land compensation and transfer procedures. This is \nhandled by Xishui Township under the supervision of the Sunan County Land and Resources \nOffice and Sunan County Grassland Management Office).  \n \n15.  Both the PIA and local governments (Sunan Grassland Management Office and the \ntownship government) are responsible for maintaining records of project impacts, compensation \nand related documents. To ensure proper implementation, the village committees will provide \nsupport to the affected households through information dissemination, adequate consultation, \neffective grievance procedures, asset measurement and valuation, compensation payments, \nand rehabilitation measures, and skills training and employment. The Sunan County Audit Office \nwill regularly check that compensation funds are properly administered.  \n \n ", "Appendix 14  57\nH.  Implementation Process \n \n16.  The following steps will be carried out by the PIA to ensure that the resettlement policy \nframework is being complied with. \n \n(i)  Conduct Land Measurement Survey and Socioeconomic Survey. The land \nmeasurement  survey  of  the  project  site  will  be  carried  out  by  the  relevant \nresettlement  implementation  agency,  with  the  participation  of  affected \nhouseholds, staff from project owner, and officials from township and villages \nconcerned.  During  the  survey,  the  scope  of  land  acquisition  and  demolition \nimpacts  for  all  affected  households  will  be  carefully  measured,  and  then \nconfirmed  by  the  affected  people.  Also,  a  socioeconomic  baseline  survey \nincluding gender analysis will be conducted for 100% of the affected households. \n \n(ii)  Consultation  with  Affected  People.  The  compensation  policies  and \nrehabilitation measures in the RP will be discussed with affected villages and \nindividuals. The comments and feedback from local governments and affected \npeople will be reviewed by the project owner and considered in finalizing the RP. \n \n(iii)  Prepare  the  RP.  Based  on  the  detailed  impact  survey,  a  RP  including \ncompensation  rates,  budget,  livelihood  rehabilitation  plans,  and  monitoring \narrangements will be prepared by the project owner based on this resettlement \npolicy framework. The RP will be submitted to ADB for review and approval at \nleast 3 months prior to acquisition of the land. \n \n(iv)  Disclose the RP Policy to the Affected People. After the RP is finalized with \ndetailed compensation standards and rehabilitation measures, it will be disclosed \nto the affected people, villages, and relevant government offices. The public \ndisclosure of RP could be carried out by holding public meetings, putting up \nnotice in the affected villages, or distributing resettlement information booklets to \nthe affected people. The endorsed RP will be uploaded on ADB\u2019s website.  \n \n(v)  Sign  Compensation  Contract  and  Pay  Compensation  to  the  Affected \nPeople. The final step of resettlement implementation is to sign compensation \ncontracts and deliver payments to the affected villages and people, which should \nbe completed prior to the transfer of land use rights, displacement of housing or \ndispossession of assets. A copy of the compensation contract has to be given to \nthe affected people from the respective agencies for record. Along with cash \ncompensation, the project owner and local governments will provide necessary \nassistance during the relocation and rehabilitation.

Introduction \n \n1.  The proposed Multitranche Financing Facility (MFF) for the Investment Program is the first \nMFF in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The project processing team has put special emphasis on a \nbottom-up approach in explaining the implementation of the MFF within the Government. The project \nimplementing agencies (PIAs), Zhangye city government (ZCG), relevant bureau in Gansu provincial \ngovernment  (GPG),  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  (NDRC),  and  Ministry  of \nFinance (MOF) were regularly consulted and briefed.   \n \nB.  Investment Program Readiness  \n \n2.  Framework Financing Agreement. The draft framework financing agreement (FFA) setting \nout the principles by which ADB would provide financing and the Government would avail of such \nfinancing was signed with the Government on 27 October 2006.  \n \n3.  First Periodic Financing Request (PFR). The first project under the Investment Program is \nready for implementation (Table A15). The PFR for Project 1 in the amount of $22 million was also \nsubmitted by the Government on 27 October 2006. A detailed appraisal report on Project 1 was \nprepared and reviewed by ADB. There are no outstanding issues. \n \n4.  Safeguard  Frameworks.  The  environmental  and  social  safeguard  frameworks  were \ndiscussed in detail and agreed upon with the PIAs and the Executing Agency (GPG). Both projects \nin the Investment Program are environmental category A. The Project 1 summary environmental \nimpact assessment (SEIA) was circulated to the Board on 10 April 2006. Also for Project 1, the \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous people categories are B. The short resettlement plan (RP) \nfor Project 1 was prepared by the PIA and reviewed by ADB. The safeguard documents for Project 2 \nwill be prepared by the PIA as per the agreed-upon safeguard frameworks. Technical assistance \n(TA) consultants will assist the PIA. ADB will closely monitor and review the safeguard documents.  \n \n5.   Capacity to Manage the Investment Program. The detailed assessment was carried out by \nthe TA consultants and ADB. Based on the assessment, and the performance of the PIA, ZCG, and \nGPG on an ongoing project loan in the scheme, there is adequate capacity in the Government to \nmanage the Investment Program. ADB loan review missions will continue to monitor compliance and \nassist the Government on a as-required basis.     \n \nC.
