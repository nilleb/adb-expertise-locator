INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  summit,  held  in \nThimphu, Bhutan, in 2010, recognized the importance of developing transport infrastructure and \ntransit facilities, especially for landlocked countries, to promote intra-SAARC trade. Recent \nagreements on regional connectivity between Bangladesh and India during 2010 are a critical \nstepping stone for opening connectivity, not only between Bangladesh and India, but also with \nBhutan and Nepal, diversifying regional and international transport routes to provide the most \nefficient routes. This will enhance markets and opportunities for regional development in South \nAsia, leading to balanced regional growth and poverty reduction. \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting regional cooperation in the \ntransport sector through SAARC, the Bay of Bengal Initiative for MultiSectoral Technical and \nEconomic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), and the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation for \nover a decade. Major contributions include assisting the SAARC Regional Multimodal Transport \nStudy (SRMTS)1 and the BIMSTEC Transport Infrastructure and Logistics Study (BTILS).2 The \ntransport sector is a priority for regional cooperation and integration as identified in the second \nHigh Level Forum on Emerging Vision for Shared Prosperity: South Asia and Beyond, held in \nManila in August 2010. \n \n3.  The  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)3 is  built  on  the  strategic  directions  and \nunderstanding established under SRMTS and BTILS, with a focus on the four South Asian \ncountries: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal; and will identify the economic impacts of \npriority subregional transport projects on the national and regional economies. It will promote \ninterregional  and  intraregional  transport  connectivity,  improve  cross-border  transport,  and \nenhance optimal multimodal mix and intermodal connectivity. The fact-finding mission visited \nBangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal from 23 August to 9 September 2010. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Although South Asia has been one of the fastest-growing economic regions in the world, \nintraregional trade accounts for only about 5% of total trade in the region. By comparison, \nintraregional trade accounts for 26% of total trade in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \n52% of total trade in North American Free Trade Agreement countries, and 58% of total trade in \nthe European Union. The South Asian Free Trade Area is slowly being implemented, while \nbilateral free-trade agreements have also encouraged an increase in trade volumes. However, \ninvestment in the region must be accelerated, particularly in less-developed areas. \n \n5.  Road transport accounts for 65%\u201370% or more of the freight movement in South Asia \nand dominates the overall regional transport system. However, South Asia has one of the \nlargest  railway  networks  in  the  world,  with  systems  in  India,  Bangladesh,  and  Sri  Lanka. \nAlthough it has been losing its market share to road transport, this trend could be reversed by \nhuge investments in railway development plans in India and Bangladesh. The region is also \ninterconnected  by  both  main-line  and  deep-sea  container  and  feeder  ships  distributing \ncontainers  throughout  the  region  from  hub  ports.  Container  throughput  growth  has  been \nimpressive for Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka. There are over 200 flights linking regional \n                                                \n1  SAARC Secretariat. 2007. Regional Multimodal Transport Study. Kathmandu. \n2  ADB. 2008.

Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 July 2010. \n ", "2   \ndestinations.  Regional  inland  waterways  exist  between  Bangladesh  and  India.  Bhutan  and \nIndia\u2019s northeastern states are linked to the rest of India by the narrow, 27-kilometer-long Siliguri \nroute referred to as the \u201cchicken\u2019s neck,\u201d and use Kolkata and Haldia as their gateway ports. \nThis important regional route illustrates two broad issues constraining regional connectivity in \nSouth Asia: the limited capacity of physical infrastructure and nonphysical barriers. \n \n6.  There are various constraints on regional connectivity in South Asia as identified in \nBTILS and SRMTS. The overall quality of road infrastructure requires improvement to the \nstandard for articulated trucks. High axle-load trucks could then be used for more efficient trade. \nIn rail transport, gauge difference is a major challenge for efficient international trade. Rail \nconnectivity with landlocked countries would boost the trade of lower-value products. Regular \ncontainer service networks would enhance the competitiveness of the railways. In maritime, \ndraught constraints limit the accessibility of large ships. Operational efficiency and intermodal \nconnectivity must also be improved. Main-line and deep-sea container ships, currently calling at \nColombo, may change routes depending on the technology of vessels and the efficiency of \nvarious ports. In aviation, improvements are needed in airport capacity, cargo handling capacity, \nand intermodal connectivity. In trade facilitation, full utilization of information technology for \nautomated customs clearance is required in parallel with overall customs modernization and \nreform. Border infrastructure also needs to be improved. \n \n7.  Inadequate coordination among transport subsectors and intermodal connectivity are \nprincipal factors constraining improvement in regional connectivity. For roads and railways, the \nlast sections of links to border-access points are often left undeveloped because they are \nbeyond their major networks and multiagency coordination is required. In aviation, possible \nrerouting may be explored to improve the efficiency of air transport. This, however, requires \nmultiagency  coordination,  including  agencies  relating  to  defense  and  foreign  affairs. While \nsolving constraints by mode, an optimal multimodal mix should be pursued to ensure the \nefficiency  of  economic  activities  and  energy  consumption,  which  also  requires  adequate \ncoordination among transport subsectors and non-transport agencies. For the long term, the \noptimal multimodal mix should help mitigate climate change. \n \n8.  Countries with well-developed and integrated transport and communications systems \ntend to attract more foreign direct investment. Integrated transport systems improve access to \nsubregional markets, making structural changes in their production capacities that can expand \nand diversify the basket of goods available for export. This is essential to transforming the \nsmaller economies of South Asia. \n \n9.  The transport  and trade facilitation strategy for  South  Asia  will  support the goal  of \nregional development through cooperation by focusing on external regional and ultimately global \nlinkages. In recent years, governments at the regional level have developed policy frameworks \nand  strategies  for  regional  connectivity  (BTILS)  and  identified  a  priority  regional  transport \nnetwork (SRMTS). At the same time, national development plans have begun to reflect the \nimportance of external and global linkages. Further integration of national transport systems \nwith subregional systems is required, as identified by BTILS and SRMTS. The development of \nnational transport projects of subregional importance is the first building block of this process. \n \n10.  SRMTS, BTILS, the Asian Highway network, and the Trans-Asian Railway network have \nidentified key regional transport projects from the strategic perspective. As a result of these \nstrategic perspectives, ADB has provided financing assistance to national projects with regional \n ", "  3 \nimplications in Bhutan and Nepal.4 The progress and implementation of these projects have \nvaried  across  countries,  depending  on  their  importance  from  the  perspective  of  in-country \nconnectivity. Built on these strategic perspectives, the TA will identify critical sections or projects \nfor prioritization to realize the economic impacts of such priority regional projects on each \ncountry and the region as a whole and prepare specific projects with engineering, social and \nenvironmental  studies,  prompting  governments,  ADB,  and  other  development  partners  to \ncoordinate their investments in these regional transport projects. The TA will also address \ninadequate coordination among transport subsectors and intermodal connectivity. \n \n11.  The current regional cooperation operations business plan (2010\u20132012) continues to \nsupport  the  region  to  realize  its  full  economic  and  social-development  potential,  including \nenabling South Asia to integrate its cooperation initiatives with neighboring regions.5 To achieve \nthis goal, it has five key operational objectives: (i) improving connectivity, (ii) facilitating trade \nand investment, (iii) developing regional tourism, (iv) facilitating energy cooperation, and (v) \npromoting private sector cooperation. The TA is required to prioritize and prepare projects for \nimproving regional connectivity to promote regional cooperation and integration. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The impact of the TA is to promote regional cooperation and integration among South \nAsian countries through increased passenger and freight transport in the regional transport and \ndistribution system. Major indicators include the increased volume of cross-border traffic above \nthe average traffic growth rate of the country concerned, and increased industrial activities in \nproject-influenced areas. The outcome of the TA is to promote investment in regional transport \nprojects  in  South  Asian  countries.  Major  indicators  include  the  increased  number  and \ninvestment amount of regional transport projects. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will comprise two components: (i) a regional transport sector study to produce a \nregional transport master plan prioritizing critical projects with future regional traffic flow, and (ii) \nprefeasibility  studies  for  high-priority  regional  projects  with  immediate  impacts  to  be \ndemonstrated. The two components will be conducted in parallel and focus is on prefeasibility \nstudies, comprising engineering, social, resettlement and environmental studies, so that actual \nimplementation for immediate financing could be considered by ADB, development partners and \ngovernments. The TA consultants will review the extensive series of related reports compiled \nover the past decade, and consult with experts currently engaged under various regional TAs in \nSouth Asia, including those relating to trade aspects, to develop traffic scenarios. The TA will \nassess the studies and investment projects currently planned or underway in each country. It \nwill field missions to all four countries to discuss transport and non-transport agencies relevant \nto regional transport connectivity. It will also set up a computerized database to be easily \nadjusted and used by each country for future planning and monitoring. \n                                                \n4  ADB. 2009.

Scope of Services \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) will prioritize regional transport projects based on an \neconomic assessment of these projects, and undertake a prefeasibility study for at least one \npriority project in each subsector. The study comprises two components: (i) a regional transport \nsector study, and (ii) a prefeasibility study of high-priority projects. Support for coordination will \nalso be provided through the TA implementation. \n \n2.  During the TA implementation, the consultants will hold regional and national meetings \nas  well  as  workshops  and  conferences  to  advance  the  consultative  process  among  the \ncountries in the region, build a consensus, and monitor the progress of the proposed TA. \n \n1.  Regional Transport Sector Study \n \n3.  The consultants will undertake a regional transport sector study, which will serve as a \nbasis for the development of regional systems of transport over the long term. The study will \nindicate critical links that need to be established, the most suitable modalities for such linkages, \nthe criteria for prioritization of system elements, the possible phasing of their development, \nfinancing options and possibilities, and the likely socioeconomic and environmental impacts. \nThe study will be based on the findings and recommendations of existing regional studies, \nparticularly  the  South  Asian  Association  for  Regional  Cooperation  (SAARC)  Regional \nMultimodal  Transport  Study  (SRMTS)  and  the  Bay  of  Bengal  Initiative  for  MultiSectoral \nTechnical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC ) Transport Infrastructure and Logistics Study \n(BTILS). While SRMTS, BTILS, the Asian Highway, and the Trans-Asia Railway provide certain \nroutes, the study will also consider potential alternate routes, based on the latest progress of \nrelevant projects. \n \n4.  A team of consultants will undertake the following tasks, in close coordination with \nongoing Asian Development Bank (ADB) subregional studies: \n \n(i)  Assessing existing traffic and setting out scenarios for transport demand forecast, \nassuming  country-specific  development;  certain  trade  policies;  cross-border \nefficiency,  based  on  the  development  of  trade  practices;  and  cross-border \noperations in the region. Realistic scenarios will be set for at least three cases \nproviding  low-,  medium-,  and  high-trade  volumes,  taking  into  account  global \nlogistic chains.   \n(ii)  Analyzing networks and forecasting traffic for each subsector (road, rail, air, port, \nand waterway), taking into account intermodal connectivity and the optimal and \nrealistic modal mix, e.g., identifying the main transport network systems required \nto  link  production  with  other  economic  and  tourism  centers;  and  developing \nopportunities in the region, by utilizing existing data and studies, and conducting \na traffic-data survey as required to supplement and update existing data. \n(iii)  Surveying transport infrastructure inventory for each subsector, utilizing existing \ndata and studies, and conducting supplemental surveys as required, to estimate \nthe preliminary development cost for required improvements of regional transport \nprojects as a whole and for each country. \n(iv)  Assessing  social,  resettlement,  and  environmental  impacts,  and  identifying \nmeasures to mitigate major negative impacts as required. \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n \n(v)  Developing a set of prioritization criteria in consultation with governments and \nADB, and utilizing them, highlighting contributions to regional cooperation with \ndistributions to each country. \n(vi)  Undertaking  economic  assessments  for  each  project  to  estimate  the  rate  of \nreturn on investment for the region (economic internal rate of return as regional \nprojects), with distributions to each country (economic internal rate of return as \nseparate  national  projects),  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  the \nEconomic  Analysis  of  Projects  and  Handbook  for  the  Economic  Analysis  of \nSubregional Projects.1 \n(vii)  Assessing the distribution of costs and benefits among countries, and, if there \nare substantial differences, providing a mechanism for how such imbalances, if \nany, can be adjusted.   \n(viii)  Studying  financing  options,  including  possible  public\u2013private  partnership \nschemes. \n(ix)  Prioritizing regional projects and identifying bottlenecks in each subsector for \nurgent,  medium-  and  long-term  development  (10  years),  and  identifying  the \nhighest-priority regional transport projects for possible ADB financing. \n(x)  Preparing a computerized database that can be easily adjusted and used by \neach country for future planning and monitoring. \n \n5.  In addition to issues discussed in the BTILS, consultants will take into account the \nfollowing:  \n \n(i)  For roads, railways, and land ports, developing the institutional mechanism to \nensure the development of access links to border points, taking into account \nmultiagency coordination. \n(ii)  For  seaports,  the  need  for  strategic  and  coordinated  development  may  be \ndetermined by identifying the role of each port in the global logistics chain for \nefficient transport investment. \n(iii)  For aviation, the possible restructuring of air routing may be explored to improve \nthe  efficiency  of  air  transport,  in  addition  to  regional  open  skies  and  safety \naspects. \n \n  2.  Prefeasibility Study \n \n6.  Consultants will assess and prepare studies of regional transport projects, which will be \nidentified as high priority with immediate impacts to be demonstrated. The studies, which will be \nselected in close consultation with the participating governments from a list of potential transport \nprojects,  are  expected  to  provide  potential  projects  to  be  financed  by  ADB  and/or  other \ninterested parties by the end of the proposed TA. Apart from the obvious benefits of advancing \nregional economic cooperation and of the attendant development impact, the positive signals \nthat such quick results will convey should increase interest in and a commitment to furthering \nregional economic cooperation. \n \n7.  A team of consultants will undertake the prefeasibility study for priority regional transport \nprojects,  including  engineering,  economic,  financial,  environment,  social,  and  resettlement \nstudies. In addition, the prefeasibility study will highlight: (i) the justification of the proposed \nproject as a priority within the subregional transport network, (ii) the contributions of the project \n                                                \n1  ADB. 1997.
