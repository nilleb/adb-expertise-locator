I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Guangdong  Chaonan  Water  Resources \nDevelopment and Protection Demonstration Project.1 \n2.  The project will protect water resources and improve water security in Chaonan District, \nShantou Municipality, Guangdong Province. The project will ensure new or more reliable water \nsupply to about 1.23 million urban and rural inhabitants of Chaonan District by integrating \nurban\u2013rural water supply systems and reducing water losses. It will also support watershed \nmanagement through reforestation, pollution prevention and water quality monitoring, public \nawareness building, and institutional capacity development.2 \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Chaonan  District  is  a  county-level  administrative  division  of  Shantou  Municipality  in \nGuangdong Province. About 30 kilometers away from the Shantou City center, Chaonan District \nhas a population of about 1.33 million spreading over about 600 square kilometers, of which \n1.13 million or about 85% are rural residents. Chaonan District, which administers 232 villages in \n11 towns, is a plain with hills in the northeast and coastlines in the east. Annual rainfall averages \nabout 1,830 millimeters. The total annual water resources of the district are about 580 million \ncubic meters (mcm), equivalent to only about 450 cubic meters (m3) per capita per year, which is \ninternationally considered as absolute water scarcity.3 There are about 70 small and medium-\nsized reservoirs in the district with a total storage capacity of about 224 mcm, of which eight \nreservoirs along the three river systems (Jinxi, Longxi, and Qiufeng) are the district\u2019s dominant \nwater sources, contributing about 180 mcm. \n4.  Guangdong Province has achieved remarkable growth since 1980 and it is now one of \nthe most developed provinces in the PRC, accounting for over 11% of the PRC\u2019s 2011 gross \ndomestic  product.  However,  Guangdong  faces  a  serious  challenge  of  poverty  and  rising \ninequality, representing a microcosm of the PRC. More than 18% of its rural residents lived on \nless than $2/day in 2007, and two-thirds of those who lived in poverty were found in the eastern \nand western regions, where Chaonan District is.4 Due to its large rural population and less-\ndeveloped industry and services, the district\u2019s economy and fiscal revenue fall far behind the \ndeveloped regions in Guangdong and even below the national average. Its per capita gross \ndomestic product in 2011 was only CNY16,379, which was about 32% of the provincial average \nof CNY50,807; or about 46% of the national average of CNY35,198. The per capita annual net \nincome of rural households in 2011 was CNY5,076, which was about half the provincial average \nof CNY9,372, or 72% of the national average of CNY6,977.  \n \n5.  Inadequate and unsafe water supply. Chaonan District faces a great challenge of \nensuring water security for its social and economic development due to (i) lack of adequate \nwater  treatment  and  supply  facilities,  (ii)  weak  institutional  capacity  for  managing  water \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance for Guangdong Chaonan \nWater Resources Protection and Conservation Demonstration Project (TA 8112-PRC).  \n3  Hydrologists typically assess scarcity by looking at the population\u2013water equation. An area is experiencing water \nstress when annual water availability drops below 1,700 m3/person. When annual water availability drops below \n1,000 m3/person, the population faces water scarcity; and below 500 m3 absolute water scarcity. \n4  World Bank. 2011. Reducing Inequality for Shared Growth in China: Strategy and Policy Options for Guangdong \nProvince. Washington, DC. ", "2   \n \nresources and providing water services, and (iii) water pollution in rivers and other water bodies \naround the towns and villages in the plain area. Current water supply capacity, including the \nthree major water supply systems of Jinxi, Longxi, and Qiufeng, is about 135,000 m3/day, which \nis far from meeting both the current and future demand for domestic and industrial uses in the \ndistrict. Water demand is estimated to reach 288,800 m3/day by 2020 and 331,423 m3/day by \n2025. The current water supply systems serve about 70% of the district population, but cannot \nguarantee 7-day, 24-hour services. The three water supply systems are independent from each \nother and cannot supplement each other if one system is facing water shortage. Due to low \ntechnical standards, aging of the pipes, and lack of maintenance, nonrevenue water (NRW) of \nthe current district supply systems are as high as 50% (40% leakage, 10% nonpayment), \nresulting in serious water and energy losses, high water tariffs, and limited service coverage.5 \n6.  Moreover, about 429,600 residents (32% of the population) do not have access to tap \nwater. Some residents are still using wells as direct source for cooking and drinking without \nappropriate treatment, which has caused serious health problems due to the high fluoride \ncontent in the groundwater. Such unreliable and inequitable water supply has affected economic \ndevelopment and people\u2019s living standards in Chaonan District. \n7.  Water pollution. The water quality in the reservoirs is generally good (class II)6 but soil \nerosion occurs in some catchment areas and eutrophication risk7 is increasing, especially in the \nQiufeng reservoir, due to nonpoint source pollution8 from agricultural practices in the watershed. \nLian River, which originates from Puning Municipality and flows through Chaonan District, is \nseriously polluted. The water quality of most Lian River sections is below class V, and cannot be \nused for irrigation or landscaping. In 2011, the total domestic wastewater discharge amounted \nto 22.6 mcm, and total industrial discharge reached 19.2 mcm, primarily from textile and dyeing \nfactories in the district. Inadequate wastewater treatment capacity and rural sanitation networks \nare also concerns. Currently, less than 50% of the district\u2019s wastewater is treated and only \nabout 20% of rural wastewater is connected to the district\u2019s sewerage system. \n8.  Weak institutional capacity. The district lacks adequate institutional capacity and a \nwater supply master plan for integrated water resources management. The Chaonan district \ngovernment  (CDG)  established  the  Chaonan  Water  Supply  Company  (CWSC)  in  2012  to \noperate and maintain the district\u2019s several independently operated water supply plants (WSPs) \nand the pipe networks. However, CWSC has limited control over water distribution to and tariffs \nfor end users because ownership of the distribution pipes belongs to individual towns or villages. \nCWSC supplies water through these towns and/or villages to end users, and charges the towns \nor villages instead of directly charging the end users. Such an arrangement has resulted in \nhigher overall cost, low efficiency, inadequate maintenance, and unfair and high tariffs. CWSC \nneeds to be entrusted with overall responsibility over the water supply system, and empowered \nwith qualified professionals to provide better services to its clients. There is also a need to \nstrengthen the district\u2019s overall water resources management capacity, and to increase public \nawareness on water resources protection and environmental improvement. This is to ensure the \nsustainability of water supply and thus the economic development of the district. \n                                                \n5   Nonrevenue water refers to water that has been produced and is \u201clost\u201d before it reaches the customer. \n6  The PRC\u2019s national standard defines five water quality classes: class I for headwaters and natural reserves; \nclass II for first-class drinking water sources and habitats of rare species; class III for second-class drinking water \nsources, aquaculture, and swimming; class IV for water sources for industrial use, and recreational use that does \nnot involve direct human contact with water; and class V for water sources for agricultural use and landscaping.   \n7  Eutrophication refers to excessive richness of nutrients in a lake or other body of water, frequently due to runoff \nfrom the land, which causes a dense growth of plant life and death of animal life from lack of oxygen. \n8  Nonpoint source pollution refers to diffuse pollution caused by sediment, nutrients, organic, and toxic substances \noriginating from land-use activities, which are carried to lakes and streams by surface runoff. \n ", "3 \n \n9.  Government efforts and opportunities for Asian Development Bank support. The \nprovincial, municipal, and district governments have been increasing their investments in the \ndistrict\u2019s water resources management, and water supply and wastewater treatment facilities. \nConservation zones were established around the district\u2019s three major reservoirs to protect \nwater from pollution. The reservoirs were rehabilitated to their designed function and full-storage \ncapacity. The governments are also restoring the severely polluted Lian River. Two wastewater \ntreatment plants, with a total treatment capacity of 60,000 m3/day, have been in operation since \nDecember 2010. In 2013, CDG approved its wastewater treatment plan, 2013\u20132020, which \naims to expand the two wastewater treatment plants to their design capacity of 130,000 m3/day \nand to construct three additional wastewater treatment plants and associated sewerage and \nsanitation networks by 2020 to cope with increasing wastewater volumes.9 To implement and \ncoordinate  these  activities,  the  district  needs  an  integrated  approach  to  water  resources \nmanagement and construction of water supply infrastructure for both urban and rural residents. \nIt needs external support to help (i) ensure equitable water supply and thus equitable urban and \nrural  development,  (ii)  improve  the  district\u2019s  water  resources  management  and  CWSC\u2019s \nperformance, and (iii) promote water conservation and step up water security for both urban and \nrural residents. During project preparation, opportunities for private sector participation in the \nproject were explored but found to be limited due to the fragmented ownership of the current \nwater supply pipe networks in the district.  \n10.  The project is consistent with the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, 2011\u20132015 of the Government \nof  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (government),  which  aims  to  build  a  harmonious  and \nmoderately  prosperous  society  through  livelihood  improvement,  equitable  urbanization  and \ncoordinated urban\u2013rural development, and balanced regional and environmentally sustainable \ngrowth. 10  The  project  supports  the  Water  Operational  Plan,  2011\u20132020  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for increasing water use efficiency and rural water supply coverage, \nand promoting integrated water resources management.11 The project is in line with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC, which supports the government\u2019s goal of \nbuilding  a  harmonious  society  by  focusing  on  three  strategic  pillars  of  inclusive  growth, \nenvironmentally sustainable growth, and regional cooperation and integration.12 The twelfth five-\nyear plans for Guangdong Province and Shantou Municipality also focus on building a resource-\noriented  and  environment-friendly  society  to  increase  water  use  efficiency,  improve  the \nenvironment, reduce regional development gaps, and improve people\u2019s living environment. The \nproject  also  conforms  to  the  Guangdong  Provincial  Water  Resources  Development  and \nProtection Master Plan, which emphasizes that water resources will be developed, used, and \nmanaged in a coordinated and sustainable way.13 \n11.   Lessons. The project design builds on ADB\u2019s experiences and lessons from previous \nprojects and knowledge generated from policy-oriented studies on integrated water resources \nmanagement, water supply, wastewater treatment, urban and rural development, and flood and \nwetland management in the PRC and other countries. Major lessons from those earlier projects \nand incorporated in the current project design are (i) an integrated approach of structural and \nnonstructural measures to water resources management; (ii) wide community participation and \nincreased  public  awareness  for  environmental  improvement;  (iii)  adequate  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) with sustainable financial sources based on a realistic and enforceable \n                                                \n9  Chaonan District Government. 2013.

Special  features  and  demonstration. The  project  is  expected to  demonstrate the \nfollowing innovations that can be replicated in other regions of Guangdong Province and the \nPRC: (i) an integrated approach to water resources management, (ii) inclusive water supply \nservices and integration of urban and rural water supply systems, (iii) strengthened operational \nperformance of the water utility, and (iv) institutional and tariff reforms. \n13.  Integrated  approach  to  water  resources  management.  The  project  will  not  only \nsupport  structural  measures  to  build  water  supply  facilities,  but  also  support  nonstructural \nmeasures to improve watershed management and protect water sources from pollution. The \nnonstructural  measures  include  reforestation  in  upstream  catchment  areas,  a  pollution \nprevention study, environmental awareness building and education, solid waste treatment in \nrural villages, institutional strengthening and capacity development for water resources planning, \nand support for the establishment of a water quality monitoring center and a three-prevention \n(flood, drought, and typhoon) management center. The project will also support NRW reduction \nfrom the current 50% to 25% by project completion. In addition, extensive environmental and \nsocial due diligence was conducted, including assessment of potential climate change impacts \nand sensitivity analysis of the water supply facilities, and the assessment of social risks and \npromotion of community participation. \n \n14.  Inclusive water supply services and integration of urban and rural water supply \nsystems. The project will cover the majority of Chaonan District and provide better water supply \nservices to both urban and rural residents in the district by adopting unified service standards \nand water tariffs. Water demand projections and the design of the water supply system have \nfactored  in  future  urbanization  requirements.  The  project  will  also  improve  responses  to \ndroughts and the reliability of water supply by integrating the three major supply systems of the \ndistrict so they can supplement each other when one system encounters problems. Such an \ninclusive integration is ADB\u2019s value addition to inclusive and balanced development, and applies \nto future urbanization and regional integration of Guangdong Province and other regions in the \nPRC. This model can be replicated in many similar rural and small-town water supply systems \nin the PRC to improve services and efficiency. \n \n15.  Strengthened operational performance. The project will strengthen CWSC, the major \nimplementing agency and the operator of the water supply system under the project. The project \nwill  upgrade  the  skills  of  operational  staff,  improve  operational  performance  and  viability, \nestablish water quality monitoring and control centers, and reduce operating losses. The current \nwater supply systems\u2019 NRW is particularly high, and an assessment was carried out during \nproject  preparation  to  determine  improvement  measures.  The  project  incorporates  such \nmeasures to reduce NRW with an agreed target. \n  \n16.  Institutional  and  tariff  reforms.  The  project  will  support  the  executing  agency\u2019s \ninstitutional and tariff reforms by (i) streamlining institutional arrangements for water supply \nservices in the district, which means removing involvement of towns and villages to allow CWSC \nto collect tariffs directly from end users; (ii) making services equitable to all and affordable to the \npoor according to local conditions; (iii) strengthening tariff-setting mechanisms through public \nhearings; and (iv) increasing industrial tariffs and improving CWSC\u2019s performance to recover \ncosts. \n ", "5 \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n17.  The impact of the project will be better health and quality of life in Chaonan District. The \noutcome will be improved and equitable water supply services to urban and rural residents in \nChaonan District. \nC.  Outputs \n18.  The project will have three outputs: (i) improved water resources protection, (ii) improved \nwater supply infrastructure, and (iii) strengthened institutional and staff capacity. \n19.

Investment and Financing Plans \n22.  The project is estimated to cost $230.75 million (Table 1). Detailed cost estimates by \nexpenditure category and by financier are in the project administration manual (PAM).14 \n23.  The government has requested a loan of $100,000,000 from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a grace \nperiod  of  5  years,  an  annual  interest  rate  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility,15 a commitment charge of 0.15% per year \n(the interest and commitment charges during implementation to be capitalized in the loan), and \nsuch other terms and conditions as set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. The \ngovernment is the borrower of the loan. The government will relend the loan to the Guangdong \nprovincial  government,  who  will  in  turn  onlend  it  to  CDG  through  the  Shantou  municipal \n                                                \n14  Project Administration Manual (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n15 The interest rate includes a maturity premium of 0.10%. This is based on the above loan terms and the \ngovernment\u2019s choice of repayment option and dates. \n ", "6   \n \ngovernment.

Implementation Arrangements \n25.  CDG  will  be  the  executing  agency  responsible  for  overall  project  planning  and \nmanagement. A project leading group, headed by the governor of CDG, will ensure coordination \nacross sectors and guide project preparation and implementation. A project management office \nhas been established within CDG to be responsible for daily coordination of project preparation \nand implementation. The implementing agencies include CWSC and the Chaonan bureaus of \neducation,  environmental  protection,  forestry,  urban  management,  and  water  affairs.  The \nGuangdong Provincial Finance Department, which has implemented several ADB- and World \n                                                \n16  The amount of taxes and duties to be financed in the project has been determined based on the principles that \n(i)  the amount is within the reasonable threshold identified during the country partnership strategy preparation \nprogress, (ii) the amount does not represent an excessive share of the project, (iii) the taxes and duties apply only \nwith respect to ADB-financed expenditures, and (iv) the financing of taxes and duties is relevant to the success of \nthe project since the percentage of some financed expenditures needs to be 100%. \n ", "7 \n \nBank-financed  projects,  will  provide  overall  guidance,  coordination,  supervision,  and \nmanagement,  and  will  be  responsible  for  establishment,  management,  monitoring,  and \nreconciliation of the imprest account. The implementation arrangements are summarized in \nTable 3 and described in detail in the PAM (footnote 14). \nTable 3: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  October 2014\u2013September 2019 \nEstimated completion date  30 September 2019 (loan closing date: 31 March 2020) \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Project leading group: \nGovernor of the Chaonan district government (chair) \nVarious district bureaus and town governments (members) \n(ii)   Executing agency  Chaonan district government \n(iii)  Key implementing  Chaonan  Water  Supply  Company  and  the  Chaonan  bureaus  of  education, \nagencies  environmental protection, forestry, urban management, and water affairs \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project implementation unit under each implementing agency, with 3\u20135 staff each \nProcurement  International competitive bidding  9 contracts  $61.75 million \nNational competitive bidding  14 contracts  $86.46 million \nShopping  1 contract  $0.10 million \nConsulting services  Quality- and cost-based selection  220 person-months  $2.18 million \nIndividual consultant selection  10 person-months  $0.14 million \nRetroactive financing and  The Chaonan district government has requested advance contracting and retroactive \nadvance contracting  financing to enable early start of procurement of civil works, goods, consulting \nservices, and training.

DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n26.  The project technical designs are based on locally proven engineering designs and in \naccordance with relevant PRC design guidelines and local regulations. Technical feasibility was \nassessed to be adequate after detailed examination of the project\u2019s compatibility with local \nconditions, including projections of water resources balance and demand\u2013supply relationship. \nAlternative technical options identified the most suitable WSP locations and water treatment \nsystems in terms of economic and safeguards aspects. The processes selected for water and \nsludge treatment are appropriate for O&M and are in accordance with the technical capacity of \nthe local implementing agencies. To ensure adequate skills, the project will finance capacity \nbuilding such as (i) training under the capacity development output to ensure sustainable O&M \nof project facilities, (ii) preparation of a water resources protection and development action plan, \nand (iii) strengthening of the capacity for water management by financing a water supply control \ncenter  and  a  three-prevention  management  center.  Installation  of  water  meters  and  NRW \nreduction are closely coordinated with the proposed water tariff reforms. \nB.  Economic and Financial \n27.  The project economic analysis used with- and without-project scenarios following ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects (1997). The project\u2019s economic costs were \n ", "8   \n \nderived from the investment and O&M costs. The project\u2019s economic benefit was derived from \nwillingness-to-pay estimation based on the survey conducted in the project area. The economic \nnet present value was CNY146.8 million and the economic internal rate of return was estimated \nat 15.1%, which confirmed the economic viability of the project. Sensitivity analysis further \nconfirmed robustness of the economic viability by showing economic viability in four adverse \nscenarios: 10% reduction in benefits, 10% increase in investment cost, 10% increase in O&M \ncost, and 1-year delay in project implementation. \n28.  The financial analysis confirmed the financial viability of the revenue-generating output \n(i.e., improved water supply infrastructure) and the financial sustainability of the nonrevenue-\ngenerating outputs. For the revenue-generating output, the financial internal rate of return was \nestimated at 4.4%, which exceeds the weighted average cost of capital of 2.9% and confirmed \nthe  financial  viability  of  the  output.  Sensitivity  analysis  further  showed  that  the  project  is \nsensitive to a revenue reduction and an investment cost increase. The financial analysis also \nexamined financial sustainability of nonrevenue-generating outputs and confirmed that CDG, \nthe end borrower of the ADB loan, has sufficient financial capacity to provide counterpart funds \nand  shoulder  recurrent  costs,  and  principal  and  financing  charges,  for  the  nonrevenue-\ngenerating outputs. \nC.  Governance \n29.  The procurement capacity assessment indicated that (i) CDG and the implementing \nagencies have the necessary technical and human resources to undertake procurement of \nconsulting  services,  goods,  and  works;  and  (ii)  monitoring  and  internal  controls  regarding \nprocurement are generally in place. The financial management assessment indicated that (i) the \nChaonan Finance Bureau has adequate and qualified staff for operating and administering the \nproject account and (ii) its internal control and audit will be mitigated through capacity building \nand close monitoring during project implementation. However, the assessments also found that \nCDG  and  its  implementing  agencies  have  limited knowledge  and  experience  with  ADB  or \ndevelopment partners. The project will provide necessary technical assistance and training on \nADB  procedures  and  requirements  for  financial  management,  procurement,  disbursement, \nsafeguards, and monitoring and evaluation. \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and CDG. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 14). \nD.  Poverty and Social \n31.  The project will directly benefit 1.23 million people in the plain areas of Chaonan District \nby  improving  urban  and  rural  water  supply  services,  providing  safe  drinking  water,  and \npromoting sustainable protection of water and environment. The direct beneficiaries include \nabout 76,500 members of low-income households. The project is expected to create about 655 \nfull-time employment opportunities during implementation. Most of them will be provided to local \npeople, including the local poor. The project includes measures, detailed in the social action \nplan, to ensure participation of beneficiary communities. \n32.  Gender. A gender analysis was carried out during project preparation. The project is \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming and contains design features to help advance \ngender equality. The project will bring gender benefits to women, and a gender action plan was \nprepared to ensure women\u2019s participation and employment benefits. The gender action plan has \nset numerical targets for minimal female participation in the labor force, training activities, and \n ", "9 \n \npublic awareness activities. CDG will implement the measures, monitor impacts, and provide \nADB with sex-disaggregated data on employment and participation. \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  Environment.  The  project  is  classified  as  category  B  for  environment.  An  initial \nenvironmental examination and an environmental management plan (EMP) were prepared, and \nare consistent with the requirements set out in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The \ninitial  environmental  examination  incorporates  the  results  of  the  domestic  environmental \nassessment report approved by the Shantou Municipality Environmental Protection Bureau. \nConsultations to raise public awareness of the project and receive stakeholders' inputs were \nconducted  with  communities  and  local  government  agencies.  The  conclusions  and \nrecommendations of assessments and consultations were integrated in the project design. The \ninitial environmental examination and EMP were disclosed on ADB website on 25 October \n2013.  CDG  will  be  responsible  for  EMP  implementation,  including  monitoring,  mitigation, \nreporting, and corrective actions or measures. The project management office will have final \nresponsibility for handling any disputes in the grievance redress mechanism. The institutional \ncapacity of the implementing agencies to enforce the EMP is weak, and the project will include a \ncapacity development program to ensure compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. \nImplementation of the EMP, including capacity development programs, is expected to prevent or \nminimize potential impacts.  \n34.  The  project  is  expected  to  achieve  environmental  benefits,  including  water  quality \nimprovement, better water supply services to a large majority of residents in Chaonan District, \nclimate change adaptation, reduced water and energy losses, and better health by alleviating \ndrinking  water  endemics.  No major  adverse  impacts  were  identified.  Potential  construction \nimpacts include air, noise, and water pollution; fugitive dust; soil erosion and contamination; \nsolid  waste  disposal;  interference  with  traffic  and  municipal  facilities;  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement; and occupational and community health and safety. Potential operational impacts \ninclude noise and energy use of the WSP pumps, occupational health and safety during WSP \noperation,  and  the  need  to  maintain  protection  efforts  at  the  three  reservoirs  to  minimize \nnonpoint source pollution from agriculture and rubbish dumping by local communities. A water \nbalance assessment was conducted, and potential environment-related livelihood impacts were \nassessed. No irrigated land will be reduced, and water allocated for environment will remain the \nsame as the current level. No environment-related livelihood impacts are anticipated. \n35.  Involuntary  resettlement  and  indigenous  peoples.  The  project  is  classified  as \ncategory B for involuntary resettlement and category C for indigenous peoples. The project will \nrequire permanent land acquisition of 5.3 ha of village collective land for the construction of the \nthree WSPs, including farmland, orchard land, construction land, wasteland, and water ponds. \nIn all, 15 persons from two households renting 3.0 ha of collective land are affected directly by \nthe permanent land acquisition. Use of the remaining 2.3 ha of affected collective village land \nwill  have  only  indirect  impacts.  In  addition,  total  temporary  land  occupation  for  laying  the \npipelines, access road, storing construction materials, and other requirements will be about \n151.4 ha, including 53.5 ha of state-owned land and 97.9 ha of collective land. The project will \nnot  trigger  any  house  or  building  demolition.  A  resettlement  plan  was  prepared,  which  is \nconsistent with the requirements set out in ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. The budget for \nland  acquisition  is  included  in  the  project.  When  final  design  becomes  available,  the \nresettlement plan will be updated in consultation with the affected villages and submitted to ADB \nfor  approval.  No  land  acquisition  will  be  undertaken  before  ADB\u2019s  approval  of  the  final \nresettlement plan. The resettlement plan was disclosed on ADB website on 25 October 2013.  \n ", "10   \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n36.  The project has some potential environmental, institutional, governance, and financial \nrisks. The project provides adequate measures to mitigate these risks, and the integrated \nbenefits and impacts are expected to outweigh the costs. Major risks and mitigating measures \nare summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management \nplan.17 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nThe tariff reform plan is not  CDG has committed strongly to support the realization of CWSC\u2019s \ntimely or not fully implemented.  direct charge to end users.

ASSURANCES \n37.  The government and CDG have assured ADB that implementation of the project will \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. \n38.  The government and CDG have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the project, \nwhich are set forth in the loan and project agreements.  \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n39.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  recommend  that  the  Board  approve  the  loan  of \n$100,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Guangdong Chaonan Water Resources \nDevelopment and Protection Demonstration Project, from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility; for a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years; and such other \nterms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft loan and \nproject agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n \n31 January 2014 \n                                                \n17 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "Appendix 1  11 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and Indicators  Reporting \nDesign Summary  with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact       Assumptions \nBetter health and  By 2025 (baseline year 2011):   Provincial and local  The government\u2019s \nquality of life in    statistical reports  development plan to balance \nChaonan District   Per capita annual disposable income of  periodically published  urban\u2013rural development \n  urban households increased from  by the governments  remains a priority. \nCNY20,761 to CNY58,393   of Guangdong \nImproved sanitation\u2013\n  Province and \nhousehold connections to the \nPer capita annual net income of rural  Shantou Municipality  \nwastewater treatment system \nresidents increased from CNY5,739 to   \nCNY10,822  Water resources  Risk \n  bulletin by Shantou  Water demand due to \nFluorosis morbidity rate reduced by  and Chaonan water  economic and population \n30% (2009 baseline: 11.1%)    affairs bureaus  growth exceeds available \n  resources. \nSample surveys   \nOutcome       Assumption  \nImproved and  By 2020 (baseline year 2012):   Reports by the  Water security remains the \nequitable water    governments of  local government\u2019s first \nsupply services to  A total of 233,550 households directly  Chaonan District and  agenda.  \nurban and rural  benefited from new or more reliable  Shantou Municipality    \nresidents in  water supply, including 83,250    Risks  \nChaonan District   households (12,490 urban, 70,760  Records of the water  Measures for demand \n  rural) newly connected to piped water  supply company   management to conserve \nsupply and 150,300 households    water are insufficient. \n(22,540 urban and 127,760 rural) with  Sample social   \nmore reliable water supply services  surveys  Extreme droughts in all the \n    three water source rivers and \nWater service coverage for urban\u2013rural  Project completion  reservoirs could result in \nresidents increased from 70% to 95%  report   reduced water availability for \n    24-hour water supply, \nNonrevenue water reduced from 50%  particularly for rural residents.  \nto 25%    \n \nSatisfaction with the water supply \nservices increased from 50% to 80% \n \nAbout 4,000 women will be released \nfrom fetching water during dry season \nOutputs       Assumption  \n1.
