INTRODUCTION \n1.  The water policy1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), approved in January 2001, \npromotes national water sector reforms, integrated water resources management, and better \nwater services for the poor. In addition, the policy commits ADB to regional and subregional \ncooperation  by  assisting  with  water  sector  assessments  and  data  exchange,  enhancing \nawareness and understanding of water sector issues and the needs of each country, and \nsupporting water partnerships in ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs).  \n \n2.  The Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector (CFWS), established in December 2001, is \na multi-agency umbrella facility to promote effective water management policies and practices at \nthe regional, subregional, and country levels, and thereby catalyze the implementation of ADB\u2019s \nwater policy in the Asia and Pacific region. Contributions to the CFWS by external agencies are \nmade in annual tranches. As of May 2006, ADB had received committed contributions from the \ngovernments of the Netherlands ($18.2 million) and Norway ($2.1 million) for the CFWS.   \n \n3.  The CFWS finances a coherent program of activities that seeks to increase synergy in \nADB\u2019s water sector operations by providing pilot demonstration facilities, access to knowledge \nproducts and services, capacity building to support generic sector reforms, awareness and \nadvocacy, water partnerships, regional cooperation, monitoring, and coordination. The Fund \naims to add value to the water operations carried out by ADB\u2019s regional departments and is not \nintended to replace resources for regular operational activities.  \n \n4.  The CFWS is accessed through a series of regional technical assistance (TA) projects \nfor promoting effective water management policies and practices. This TA is the fifth in the \nseries and its design and monitoring framework is set out in Appendix 1. Like the four previous \nTAs,2 whose results are documented in a Supplementary Appendix,3 this TA covers the six \napproved categories of the program.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  The TA design provides for the continuity of initiatives begun in predecessor TA projects, \nand responds to five major issues. They are (i) the results achieved to date through CFWS \nactivities, (ii) the current strategy5 of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department \n(RSDD)  and  its  2006  key  result  areas  (KRAs),  (iii)  a  recent  review  of  water  policy \nimplementation by an independent panel, (iv) an evaluation of the CFWS by the Netherlands \nMinistry of Foreign Affairs on behalf of both sources of external assistance, and (v) the Water \nFinancing Program (WFP) approved by ADB\u2019s Management in March 2006.  \n6.  Results for all six program categories have been positive and now justify moving to the \nnext phase. For example, the initial implementation of the CFWS medium-term strategy focused \non the need to build greater awareness of water issues and ADB\u2019s water policy and to advocate \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Manila (TA 6031, TA 6093,  \nTA 6123, and TA 6219). \n3  The Supplementary Appendix (available on request) presents the Fund\u2019s cumulative accomplishments to date. \n4  The six categories of the program are (i) pilot and demonstration activities; (ii) water partnerships; (iii) knowledge \nbase  and  capacity  building;  (iv)  promotion  and  public  awareness;  (v)  regional  events  and  initiatives;  and \n(vi) program coordination, monitoring, and evaluation. \n5  ADB. 2005. Regional and Sustainable Development Department: Towards Greater Relevance and Effectiveness. \nManila. \n ", "2   \nfor policy reform. Recent performance indicators, provided through an independent survey of \npolicy makers,6 show that over 50% of them have used ADB awareness products in discussions \nwith their colleagues. A network of over 400 journalists familiar with water issues and ADB\u2019s \nwater policy is now in place with a media reach of more than 39 million readers. This network \nwill be invaluable in facilitating ADB water communications and increasing the profile of ADB \nwithin the water sector. Current monthly hits on the water website recently reached 200,000. \nHaving achieved these results, it is now timely to shift the focus of the communications strategy \nfrom widely-based awareness to targeted stakeholder advocacy, and to obtain the benefits of \nhaving water communications integrated with and managed by the Department of External \nRelations (DER), especially in terms of increasing the level of support to regional departments.   \n7.  Current RSDD strategy focuses on contributing towards a quantum increase in water \ninvestments and service coverage by regional departments over 2006\u20132010, as the RSDD 2006 \nKRAs  are  designed  to  (i)  support  quality  and  compliance  in  ADB  operations,  (ii)  provide \nknowledge support, and (iii) offer innovation services. These KRAs have been adopted as the \nframework for implementing the six CFWS program categories. \n \n8.  During 2005, ADB\u2019s water policy implementation was reviewed by an independent panel \nwhose  recommendations  included  increasing  ADB  and  DMC  capacities,  and  promoting \n\u201cbusiness unusual\u201d to increase water access, affordability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.7 \nFrom December 2005 to January 2006, the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs conducted a \ncomprehensive review of the CFWS, involving several visits to Manila and field visits to Nepal, \nPhilippines and Viet Nam. The evaluation recognized the role of the CFWS in positioning ADB \nas a leader in the water sector. At the same time, it identified the need to increase direct \noperations support and foster water policy reform and integrated water resources management \nthrough strategic partnerships and alliances, which is in line with RSDD\u2019s new strategic direction.   \n \n9.  In March 2006, ADB\u2019s Management decided to give higher priority to water investments \nin the medium term through the WFP, which seeks to increase investments over 2006\u20132010 as \na core area of ADB\u2019s operations, in order to respond more effectively to the Asia and Pacific \nregion\u2019s critical water investment needs.8 WFP builds on ADB\u2019s work in the first 5 years of its \n\u201cWater for All\u201d policy. It includes a large pipeline of programmed water investments, a wide array \nof knowledge and awareness products, and services to support regional cooperation in water. It \nfocuses on combining increased investments in water infrastructure with capacity building and \nreforms.9   \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005.  Independent Review of Water Awareness Program. Manila. \n7  2006.  Review  Panel  Report.  In  May  2006,  ADB  will  finalize  Management\u2019s  response  to  the  panel\u2019s \nrecommendations, delegating to the ADB Water Committee the preparation of an action plan. \n8  The Asia Water Watch 2015 study, commissioned by ADB, the World Health Organization, the United Nations \nDevelopment Programme, and the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, \nestimates that annual investments of $8 billion\u2014at minimum\u2014will be needed over the next decade to meet \nMillennium Development Goal targets for safe drinking water and sanitation alone. \n9  WFP will ensure the delivery of a substantial investment, reform, and capacity development program in three key \nareas: (i) rural water services to improve health and livelihoods in rural communities, including investments in water \nsupply and sanitation, irrigation and drainage; (ii) urban water services to support sustained economic growth in \ncities,  including  investments  in  water  supply,  sanitation  and  wastewater  management,  and  environmental \nimprovement; and (iii) basin water management to promote integrated water resources management and healthy \nrivers,  including  investments  in  the  infrastructure  and  management  for  multifunctional  water  regulation  and \nhydropower facilities developed in a basin context, flood management, and the conservation and improvement of \nwatersheds, wetlands, and ecosystems. \n \n ", "  3\n10.  This TA responds to the findings of the policy review and water fund evaluation and the \nobjectives of WFP by increasing the proportion of support to operations, addressing capacity \nwithin water agencies, and sustaining partnerships and strategic alliances with key regional \nbodies, associations, and specialist nongovernment organizations (NGOs). \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA will accelerate progress in addressing water issues, and help in achieving the \nMillennium Development Goals related to water and poverty reduction. It can achieve that result \nby enabling DMCs to initiate water policy reform, undertake greater capacity development, and \ninduce higher water investment.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will deliver a number of outputs through the completion of activities that are \nbased on the RSDD KRAs, and which provide a framework demonstrating the shift in focus \ntowards increased operations support (Appendix 1).  \n \n13.  Support Quality in ADB Operations.  The TA will provide (i) services and products to \nassist in \u201croad map\u201d development and preparation of country strategies and programs; and \n(ii) support for upstream (pre-project preparatory TA stage) work, including preparation of a \ncommunication strategy for potentially contentious projects, and provision of expert services, as \nneeded, during project preparation (e.g., consultants for safeguard policies).  \n \n14.  Using the \u201ccommunities of practice\u201d (CoP) platform, this TA will help establish separate \ninterest groups addressing rural, urban, and basin water issues, to provide a venue for peer \ndiscussion on projects under development. \n \n15.  Procedures will be established to provide water team inputs to project teams in the early \nstages of project preparation. This may include water team participation before or during fact-\nfinding  missions.  The  TA  will  also  support  assessment  and  reporting  on  water  policy \nimplementation by regional departments. \n  \n16.  Regional departments will be supported in implementing  WFP by  (i) advocacy products \nthat will complement financing instruments, such as those being developed under the Innovative \nand Efficiency Initiative; and (ii) advocacy for WFP among ADB\u2019s development partners, such \nas bilateral donors, with the aim of raising the TA funds needed to support project preparation, \nreform measures, and capacity building interventions. \n \n17.  Knowledge Support. The TA will provide (i) knowledge products and networking events, \n(ii)  targeted  agency  and  partnership  capacity  development,  (iii)  strategic  alliances,  and \n(iv) specific knowledge-investment related programs. \n \n18.  Knowledge products and networking events will disseminate good practices, technical \nnotes, issues papers, and other knowledge products, such as model terms of reference, which \nare relevant to operations and DMCs. The TA will also support regional events such as \u201cWater \nWeek\u201d and a planned \u201cWater Financing Program,\u201d which will advocate water policy reform, build \nDMC capacity, and encourage water investment. DMCs will share their experiences on urban, \nrural and basin water issues, and initiate sustainable networking among agencies within and \n ", "4   \nbetween DMCs to advance policy reform, capacity development, and water investment. To \nincrease the dissemination of knowledge products, the water website will be supported by the \nTA and further developed to enhance its client focus. Communications plans managed by DER \nwill  be  developed  to  increase  targeted  stakeholders\u2019  knowledge  and  capacity  to  act.  ADB \npersonnel will be supported to attend regional events as expert speakers and supplied with \nquality research, speech writing, and creative presentation services.      \n \n19.  Consistent with ADB\u2019s emerging emphasis on longer-term capacity development, the TA \nwill provide direct assistance for capacity development in a number of DMC agencies. The TA \nwill also help to coordinate the National Water Sector Apex Bodies, the Network of Asian River \nBasin  Organizations,  and  the  Southeast  Asian  Water  Utilities  Network  by  supporting  their \nbenchmarking programs. These programs will enhance the capacity to drive policy reform and \nlift service delivery performance. Strategic alliances that bring specialist skills to ADB, such as \ncivil society engagement, will also be supported by this TA.  \n \n20.  With  the  overall  guidance  of  DER,  the  TA  will  develop  on-demand  pre-investment \ncommunication  support  services  for  regional  departments,  to  address  sensitive  project \nstakeholder  issues  that  may  affect  investment  plans  and  project  implementation.  These \nproducts reflect the continuing evolution of the water awareness program. \n  \n21.  Innovation  Services.  Innovation  and  \u201cbusiness  unusual\u201d  are  supported  by  the  TA \nthrough its pilot and demonstration activity (PDA) facility and the knowledge base facility, which \nprovide valuable on-demand direct assistance to regional departments and enable new ideas \nand approaches to be tested and then replicated or scaled up. PDAs are small-grant projects \nthat introduce and validate new or innovative development approaches that are highly replicable. \nMost of this support will go to water project teams in regional departments, and will strengthen \ncore operations, including policy dialogue, country programming, and project preparation and \nimplementation. Support will also be given to field-based applied research by local stakeholders, \nincluding  NGOs,  national  and  subregional  water  partnerships,  academic  institutions,  and \nconsultancy firms.   \n \n22.  With cofinancing support from the Private Sector Operations Department, and under the \nauspices of an urban services initiative, the TA will also support water-related demonstration \nprojects in India that will create new opportunities for ADB to assist in water and wastewater \ninfrastructure with private sector participation.10   \n \n23.  To further strengthen the results focus of the CFWS, the TA will contribute to the current \nwork of enhancing the results framework, including target setting and performance monitoring.  \nIt  includes  engaging  a  fund  results  manager.  This  responds  to  improvement  opportunities \nidentified during the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs evaluation.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n25.  The total cost of the TA is $3.2 million. The TA will be financed on a grant basis, \n$3 million from the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector, to be administered by ADB, and \n$200,000 from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The ADB funding will be used for the special urban \ninitiative referred to in para. 22.  The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.   \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance to India for the Support for the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal \nMission Project. Manila (TA 4775).  This TA inputs will fund three feasibility studies that complement TA 4775 \nobjectives that support the $11 billion, 63-city urban initiative. \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n26.  ADB will be the Executing Agency of the TA. The Energy, Transport, and Water Division \n(RSID) will be responsible for coordinating all TA activities, which will be monitored through \nregular meetings with regional departments and the Water Committee. RSID staff will also \ninteract frequently with regional department staff to collaborate in identifying and implementing \noperational  support  activities.  DER  will  oversee  the  planning  and  implementation  of  the \ncommunications component of the TA, providing synergy to this specialist aspect of the TA. \nEach  PDA  may  be  implemented  by  a  national  organization  or  NGO,  which  will  be  the \nimplementing agency of such a PDA. ADB will enter into a letter of agreement with each \nimplementing  agency  that  is  responsible  for  implementing  and  completing  PDA  projects \n(Appendix 3). PDA proposals will be selected according to the criteria and procedures published \non the ADB water website and with consultation with the water communities of practice. The \nregional departments, through a designated activity officer, will be responsible for initiation, \nimplementation, technical supervision and monitoring of PDA activities, with administrative and \ntechnical support provided by the RSID water team. \n \n27.  About  29  person-months  of  international  and  136  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants\u2019 time will be needed to implement the activities of the TA. The required areas of \nexpertise  are  expected  to  include  policy,  institutional,  technical,  economic,  and  financial \ndisciplines related to water reforms. Further international and domestic consultants may be \nrecruited to fill skills gaps. The consultants will mostly be recruited as individuals, although \nconsultancy firms may be engaged, e.g., for some PDA projects. ADB and, in the case of PDA \nprojects,  the  implementing  agencies  will  recruit  consultants  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  or  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengagement of domestic consultants. Agencies implementing PDA projects will submit curricula \nvitae of consultants to ADB for approval before consultants are engaged.   \n \n28.  Outline terms of reference for consultants are shown in Appendix 4. Any equipment and \nmaterials to be financed by the TA will be procured by the consultants, ADB or, in the case of \nPDAs, the PDA implementing agencies, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \nOwnership of the equipment and materials that have been purchased for specific activities, such \nas under a PDA or for training, will normally be transferred to the implementing agencies and \nbeneficiaries. This will be clearly spelled out on a case-by-case basis in the letters of agreement \nand consulting contracts, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines.  \n \n29.  The TA will be implemented over 18 months, from July 2006 to December 2007. RSID \nwill prepare semiannual progress reports on the program and use of the CFWS in collaboration \nwith the Office of Cofinancing Operations. RSID will also monitor TA activities and make reports \navailable through the ADB water website. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n30.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $3,000,000 for Promoting Effective Water \nManagement Policies and Practices \u2013 Phase 5, to be financed on a grant basis by the CFWS.    \nIf the Board approves ADB administering the technical assistance, the President, acting under \nthe authority delegated by the Board, will approve ADB providing the balance of the technical \nassistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $200,000,  for  Promoting  Effective  Water \nManagement Policies and Practices \u2013 Phase 5, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators  Mechanisms   \nImpact       \n      Assumption \nDMCs implement water  ADB water investment  PPIS  DMCs regard water as a \npolicy reform, increase  targets are met for 2006\u2013   national priority for policy \ncapacity development and  2010     and investment  \ninvest more in water          \n  Reform measures are  Policy reform survey  \nimplemented  \nOutcome       \n      Assumption \nIncreased preparedness by  At least five DMCs initially  CSP; pipeline of projects  ADB has the financing \ntargeted DMCs to implement  targeted under WFP    products that meet the \nwater reform, build capacity  implement the needed    needs of DMCs   \nand make water investments   reforms and capacity   \n  building programs and   \naccess ADB financing   \nsupport   \n \nOutputs  Outputs completed on or     \n  before 31 December 2007     \nComponent 1\u2013Support       \nQuality in ADB Operations       \n       \nCSPs and \u201croad maps\u201d  Assist in the preparation of   CFWS results tracking   \n  water sector road maps as  system    \n  part of CSPs for (at     \n  minimum) the five DMCs     \n  targeted under WFP     \n       \nUpstream (pre-PPTA)  Provide direct operations  CFWS results tracking   \nsupport  support at pre-PPTA stage,  system   \n  including participation before     \n  and during fact-finding     \n  missions in 2006\u20132007     \n       \nPeer discussions using the  Urban, rural and basin  Report on working group   \nCoP platform  working groups formed in  meetings   \n  2006 to provide a venue for   \n  peer discussions on projects   \n  under preparation in 2006\u2013  \n  2007   \n     \nImplementation plan for   Plan available by August  Accomplishment reports \npolicy review and Fund  2006  of water team  \nreview recommendations      \n   \n ", "Appendix 1  7\n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data  Assumptions and \nTargets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms   \nComponent 2\u2013Knowledge       \nSupport and Capacity       \nDevelopment      Assumptions \n       \nPre-investment  At least three instances in  DER semiannual   Sufficient demand exists \ncommunication service to  which communication  progress reports   from regional \nregional departments   support provided to regional    departments  \n  departments at their request     \n       \nWater CoP event  Monthly water CoP events  Water team   \n  organized to facilitate  accomplishment report   \n  exchange of experiences     \n  among staff on ongoing     \n  projects and projects under     \n  preparation     \n       \nJoint partnership program  Partnership work program  Partnership reports    \naddressing civil society  agreed and stated objectives     \nparticipation in water  met        \ninvestments (Water Aid)          \n       \nADB Water Week   At least 200 participants,  Event participant survey   \n  satisfaction rating of greater     \n  than 3.7, on a scale of 1 to     \n  5, and action intentions     \n  expressed by 60% of visiting     \n  DMC participants       \n       \nAgency Capacity  At least two agencies  CFWS results tracking  Agencies and ADB \nDevelopment service   commit to capacity  system    operations are able to \n  development diagnostic and    commit to longer term CD \n  develop a CD    approaches  \n  implementation plan      \n       \nWater Communication  At least two network events  DER semiannual   Journalists have sufficient \nNetwork sustained     with satisfaction rating of  progress reports   opportunity to publish \n  participants greater than 3.7,     articles in their media  \n  on a scale of 1 to 5.

National organizations, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and academic institutions \nwill conduct pilot and demonstration activities (PDAs) in developing member countries (DMCs). \nPDAs will, for the most part, complement ADB water operations and should be driven by the \nneeds  of  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments  and  project  officers,  who  endorse  proposals  to  be \nsupported by the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector.  \n \n2.  The PDAs constitute a small-grants program to help ADB teams develop, validate, and \ndemonstrate new approaches during the processing and implementation of project preparation \nand  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA),  and  loan-financed  investment  projects.  PDAs  can \ninclude field-based applied research and demonstration activities, and are likely to be proposed \nby  local  stakeholders,  including  NGOs,  academic  institutions,  international  and  national \norganizations, and consultants. \n \n3.  PDAs are generally expected to test or highlight new approaches, confirm their efficacy, \nand then implement or plan a replication program. PDAs can be processed in connection with \nchanges in (i) national or local water policy reform processes, (ii) water advocacy approaches, \n(iii) appropriate technology, (iv) gender and development approaches, (v) participatory and \ninclusive approaches and multistakeholder representation, (vi) provision of services to the poor, \nand with (vii) other changes catalyzed by ADB\u2019s water policy. PDAs can be related to the \nmanagement of water resources and the delivery of water services. \n \n4.  In prioritizing requests for PDAs, the water communities of practice (CoP), through a \nsubcommittee, will consider the following: (i) originality, (ii) replicability, (iii) potential replicability \n(in case of a pilot test), (iv) lessons learned, (v) pro-poor focus, (vi) participatory development \nand gender inclusion, (vii) operations support, (viii) collaborative approach using partnerships, \n(ix) technically strong design, and (x) consistency with ADB\u2019s water policy. \n \n5.  A PDA is expected to be implemented over 6 months on average, and 12 months at \nmost. PDAs should not duplicate, or substitute for, ongoing or pipelined activities in the DMCs, \nbut should be directly relevant to the \u201csector outcomes\u201d cited in the country strategy program \nand/or country strategy program updates for the DMC.  \n \n6.  The type and duration of inputs for the PDA will be provided in the activity proposals to \nbe submitted by the ADB departments concerned during TA implementation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "12  Appendix 4 \nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS \n \n1.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  describe  the  main  tasks  under  this \ntechnical assistance (TA). The six Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector (CFWS) categories \nused in the four previous TA projects are used in this section to describe the specific tasks to be \nundertaken under the TA. Poverty reduction is a crosscutting priority in all tasks. The program of \nactivities  will  be  coordinated  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  through  the  Energy, \nTransport,  and  Water  Division  (RSID)  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment, in close consultation with the regional departments. \n \nA.  Water Partnerships \n2.  Domestic  water  sector  specialists  will  be  engaged  to  assist  RSID  and  regional \ndepartment  staff  in  providing  support  to  selected  activities  of  national  or  regional  water \npartnerships. This TA will specifically focus on water aid, in recognition of the need to continue \nto strengthen civil society links in the water sector, as well as providing ongoing coordination \nsupport to agreed work programs with the Southeast Asian Water Utilities Network, the Network \nof Asian River Basin Organizations, and National Water Sector Apex Bodies. \n \n3.  The type and duration of consulting inputs for the water partnership support activities will \nbe provided in the proposals to be submitted by the ADB departments concerned during TA \nimplementation. Services for water partnerships are expected to comprise approximately 12 \nperson-months of domestic consultants\u2019 time.  \n \nB.  Knowledge Base and Capacity Building  \n4.  International  and  domestic  water  specialists  will  be  engaged  on  an  individual, \nintermittent, or full-time basis to do the following: \n(i)  advise staff in ADB\u2019s operational departments on supporting country water sector \nassessments, sector road maps, strategies, policy dialogue, and reforms;  \n(ii)  conduct analyses of ongoing water sector reforms in the region, including studies \non water governance, water policies, water laws, water sector action agendas, \netc;  \n(iii)  organize capacity development programs for ADB and DMC staff on important \nwater issues and skills, drawing on the results of the capacity and training needs, \nassessments  carried  out  earlier,  including  training  seminars  and  workshops, \nparticipation  in  training  courses,  recommendations  for  country  exchange \ndialogues on priority water sector reform topics, strengthening of the ADB water \nfocal  point,  and  the  development  of  regional  research  and  capacity-building \nnetworks in accordance with ADB\u2019s water policy; \n(iv)  organize  major  events  such  as  ADB\u2019s  Water  Week  and  Water  Financing \nProgram conference; \n(v)  conduct follow-up studies building on the concepts of financing water programs, \nthe role of small-scale independent service providers, and other subjects as \ndetermined by the Water Committee; and   \n(vi)  promote  knowledge  generation  and  dissemination  on  other  important  water \ntopics, including dams and development.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  13 \n5.  Domestic specialists will also develop existing ADB databases to support ADB\u2019s water \noperations, with links to ADB\u2019s water website. The system will provide water sector statistics by \nDMC, including national water sector profiles, policies, laws, and sector road maps for DMCs; a \ncompilation  of  useful  practices  regarding  key  water  sector  reform  topics  and  on  poverty \nreduction  in  water  sector  operations;  and  links  to  water  knowledge  centers  outside  ADB. \nServices for knowledge base and capacity building are expected to comprise approximately 110 \nperson-months of domestic consultants\u2019 and 12 person-months of international consultants\u2019 time.   \n \nC.  Advocacy and Communications Operations Support   \n6.  The Department for External Relations (DER) will guide the overall direction for the \nadvocacy  and  communications  support  service,  with  technical  support  from  specialists  as \nrequired. The three-fold strategy involves (i) working closely with ADB regional department staff \nmembers, and supporting more project-related communications; (ii) disseminating knowledge \nproducts for advocacy and better ADB water operations practices; and (iii) maximizing the use \nof media tools, the ADB water website and other effective means of communications, and \ncoordinating more closely with ADB knowledge management applications.  \n \nD.

Pilot and Demonstration Activities \n8.  The monitoring of PDAs will be assisted by the water operations support coordinator, an \ninternational consultant who will analyze and compile results and lessons learned for scaling-up \nand replication. The water operations support coordinator will be required for approximately 6 \nperson-months of consulting, spread over a 12-month period. \n \nF.  Program Coordination, Monitoring, and Evaluation \n9.  The TA will engage a results manager and an accountant, both on an individual basis, to \ncarry out results monitoring and financial management processes for the CFWS.  \n \n10.  The following tasks are included in this category: \n \n(i)  further develop a results monitoring system for the activities financed by the \nCFWS, covering inputs, outputs, outcomes, and financial management; \n(ii)  manage the CFWS activities, including planning, finance, and supervision of \nconsulting personnel engaged in fulfilling terms of reference under the CFWS;  \n(iii)  monitor and organize annual reviews of the program\u2019s activities; \n(iv)  support the exchange of experience and coordination with other development \npartners to ensure coordination and to facilitate joint activities, as needed; \n(v)  support the preparation of an annual report on ADB\u2019s water sector operations, \nincluding relevant statistics and lessons learned, and a 3-year work program for \nthe water sector, including analysis of challenges, constraints, and opportunities; \nand   \n(vi)  organize regular dialogues between ADB and stakeholders, including NGOs, on \nwater reform issues.  \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \n \n11.
