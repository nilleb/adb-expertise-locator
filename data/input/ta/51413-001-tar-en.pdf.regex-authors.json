INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) seeks to support the Government \nof Mongolia in developing a comprehensive green finance policy and regulatory framework, and \nin undertaking capacity development to enhance the country\u2019s environmental sustainability.1 The \nTA is included in the country operations business plan of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \n2020\u20132021 for Mongolia.2 It is in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Mongolia, 2017\u2013\n2020  on  three  strategic  pillars:  (i)  promoting  economic  and  social  stability,  (ii)  developing \ninfrastructure for economic diversification, and (iii) strengthening environmental sustainability.3 It \nalso supports Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priority on tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability.4 Strategy 2030 indicates that \nclimate finance from ADB\u2019s own resources will reach $80 billion cumulatively from 2019 to 2030. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Mongolia\u2019s  deteriorating  environmental  conditions.  Increasing  environmental \ndegradation is a critical issue for Mongolia. Mongolia suffers the environmental consequences \nfrom urbanization and exploitation of natural resources, including air pollution, limited water \nresources and water pollution, land degradation caused by mining activities, and desertification. \nAir pollution in Mongolia\u2019s capital city, Ulaanbaatar, is among the highest in the world.5 Raw coal \nburning by households and low pressure boilers in ger districts mainly contribute to the high air \npollution levels. In January 2018, it was reported that Ulaanbaatar reached one of the highest \nlevels of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter per cubic meter rate of 3,320, \nwhich is 133 times the recommended safety level set by the World Health Organization.6 In \naddition, total greenhouse gas emissions in Mongolia in 2014 is at 34,482.73 gigagrams of carbon \ndioxide equivalent, excluding land use, land use change, and forestry. This represented a 57.09% \nincrease from the 1990 level and a 5.49% increase from the 2013 level.7 Extreme air pollution in \nMongolia remains a constant struggle, as it gives rise to health problems and related economic \ncosts, including additional health expenditures and labor productivity losses resulting from work \nabsences due to illness, as well as agricultural yield losses. To mitigate the adverse effects of \npollution and meet the demand for investment for environmental protection and sustainable \neconomic development, Mongolia needs to create a supportive policy environment to enhance \nenvironmental sustainability. \n \n3.  Government\u2019s policies and strategies to combat environmental challenges. The \ngovernment recognizes the country\u2019s sustainability issues and has approved a series of programs \nand policies to encourage green development in the country. In 2014, the National Green \nDevelopment Policy set up the measurable targets of increasing energy efficiency by 20% by \n2030 and increasing the share of renewable energy in total energy generation to 20% by 2020 \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 15 October 2019. \n2  ADB. 2019.

Moreover,  the  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  under  the  Paris \nAgreement 2016 focused on the energy, industry, agriculture, and waste sectors. The expected \nmitigation impact of these policies and measures will be a 14% reduction in total national \ngreenhouse gas emissions, excluding land use, land use change, and forestry by 2030, compared \nwith the projected emissions under a business-as-usual scenario.8 Moreover, the Government of \nMongolia\u2019s Sustainable Development Vision 2030 offers an ambitious set of goals centered on \neconomic growth and diversification, ecological balance, and social stability.9 The country strives \nto achieve upper-middle-income status by 2030 while ending all forms of poverty; reducing \nincome  inequality;  promoting  green  economy  growth;  and  building  a  stable,  professional \ngovernance system. \n \n4.  Mongolia\u2019s green finance initiative. In 2015, the Bank of Mongolia (BOM) issued an \nofficial  directive  requiring  all  banks  to  include  the  implementation  status  of  the  Mongolian \nSustainable Finance Principles in their annual reports starting in 2016.10 The Ministry of Finance \n(MOF) is working on the introduction of sustainable public procurement standards through the \nAmendment to the Law on Public Procurement (2018). The Ministry of Environment and Tourism \n(MET) has introduced tax exemptions for 41 types of green technologies. The MOF, the BOM, \nand the Financial Regulatory Commission of Mongolia have approved the Financial Market \nDevelopment Program 2025, which covers strategic objectives to build a more stable financial \nsystem, including a dedicated section for sustainable and green finance targets. However, the \nregulations of the Financial Market Development Program 2025 lack consistent enforcement \nmechanisms.11 Mongolia still faces many challenges in achieving its ambitious sustainability goals \nand targets. \n \n5.  Inadequate national green finance policy and regulatory framework. The green \nfinance development in Mongolia is still limited and lacks a comprehensive national policy and \nregulatory framework to guide and promote green investment and green finance. It also lacks a \nroad map and detailed action plan for effective implementation. The challenges faced by the \ncountry are (i) the absence of a legal and regulatory framework directly related to green finance, \n(ii) weak institutional mechanisms for policy and administrative coordination, and (iii) insufficient \ncorrelation of targets of sustainable growth with priorities of national investment policy. To support \nthe alignment of all stakeholders in the finance sector, green finance policies, guidelines, as well \nas legal and regulatory frameworks with interagency coordination need to be introduced and well \ndesigned. Moreover, the lack of clarity in green finance as to what constitutes green finance \nactivities and products, such as green loans and green bonds, is an obstacle for investors, \ncompanies, and banks seeking to identify opportunities for green investment. \n \n6.  Limited  access  to  green  finance.  The  major  barrier  for  Mongolia  to  achieve  its \nsustainability goals and targets is the lack of green financial incentives and investments.

Ulaanbaatar. \n10 Mongolia\u2019s transition toward a sustainable financial system is mostly driven by a private sector-led initiative called \nthe Mongolian Sustainable Finance Initiative. As part of this initiative, the Mongolian Sustainable Finance Principles \nwere launched in 2014 as the result of a joint effort from the Mongolian Bankers Association and its member banks, \nwith the support of the MET and the BOM, and with international support. The principles are designed to help banks \nidentify,  mitigate,  and  manage  environmental  and  social  risks.  Mongolian  Bankers  Association.

Geneva. \n ", "3 \nMongolian financial system is dominated by banks, which represented about 88% of finance \nsector assets in 2017. The nonbank finance sector, including insurance and the stock market, is \nstill small. Mongolian financial institutions lack long-term funding and a domestic deposit base. \nMoreover, lending interest rates remain high. The average annual loan interest rate was 17.7% \nfor banks in 2018, and 51.6 % for nonbank financial institutions for local currency lending in \n2017.12 The Mongolian economy is heavily reliant on the mining sector, placing the country at risk \nof global price fluctuations for commodities. Almost 90% of registered businesses in Mongolia are \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises, and most of them have limited access to finance and are \nunable to contribute sufficiently to diversification of the economy, employment creation, and \neconomic growth. New green project developers that lack track records and collateral assets face \ndifficulties in meeting banks\u2019 requirements for collateral to guarantee loans. Green financing \ncontributes to a small part of the total loan portfolio of the finance sector. In the absence of a \ncommonly agreed definition of green projects and assets, monitoring green financing flows has \nbeen limited. Based on individual banks\u2019 own green finance definitions, the total size of green \nlending was estimated at 5% of total loan assets in 2017 (footnote 11).The financial market also \nlacks long-term financing sources and there are no substantial institutional investors, such as life \ninsurance providers and pension funds. The nascent capital market needs to be diversified \nthrough new and innovative instruments like green bonds to diversify funding sources and to \naccess low-cost capital for green infrastructure and investment. \n \n7.  Weak capacity to promote green finance. The government lacks the capacity and \nresources to implement the green finance policies effectively. It has (i) limited capacity to assess, \nidentify, measure, and develop green finance projects; (ii) limited experience to implement the \nexisting regulations; and (iii) no adequate human resources and experts to promote green finance \nand measure environmental impact. More generally, while legal and regulatory frameworks are \nnow in place for environmental protection, their objectives far outstrip enforcement capacity. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: environmental sustainability in Mongolia \nenhanced (footnote 9). The TA will have the following outcome: comprehensive green finance \npolicy and regulatory framework in Mongolia enhanced.13 The project will deliver four intended \noutputs. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  The TA will help the government to promote green finance through (i) establishing national \nstrategies and guidelines, (ii) proposing a road map and action plan, (iii) proposing design of green \nfinancial products and innovative financing projects, and (iv) strengthening capacity development. \nThe TA will organize at least four workshops for knowledge exchanges and the sharing of good \npractice examples. It will provide advisory and capacity development consulting services to the \ngovernment. \n \n                                                \n12 World Bank. Open Data.

This \noutput will include (i) a review of the international green finance practices and an assessment of \nthe existing national green finance system to determine the strategies for the government; and (ii) \nestablishment of national strategies, policy recommendations, and guidelines for green finance \nwith the key stakeholders, including regulators, policy makers, and financial institutions. The legal \nand regulatory frameworks will include identification of medium-term and long-term targets and \nmilestones. \n \n11.  Output 2: A road map and action plan for green finance prepared. Based on the \nstrategies and guidelines, the TA will provide a road map and action plan for green finance with \npractical recommendations suitable for Mongolia to address the issue of a lack of long-term \nfunding, financial incentives, and investments. The TA will also prepare an overview and analysis \nof worldwide efforts on defining green finance with the means and scope for identifying green \nassets and activities through conceptual definitions, taxonomies, rating methodologies, and other \nmechanisms, based on data collected through literature review, interviews, and surveys with the \nkey stakeholders and the international financial community. The action plan will support the \nimplementation of the road map, including timelines, responsibilities, and expected outcomes. \n \n12.  Output 3: Green financial products and innovative financing projects to promote \ngreen development proposed. The TA will propose practical recommendations for investment \nstrategies that are suitable with the country situation. The design of green financial products and \ninnovative financing projects in line with the proposed investment strategies will be identified \nbased on market assessments and good international practices. This will be done in close \nconsultation with the government and in collaboration with financial institutions. A list of green \nfinancing projects suitable for potential funding support from ADB and other foreign financial \ninstitutions to promote green finance will be proposed. \n \n13.  Output 4: Capacity for green finance strengthened. The TA will prepare a capacity \ndevelopment  plan  involving  the  key  stakeholders,  including  regulators,  policy  makers,  and \nfinancial institutions, to develop their capacity for green finance based on international good \npractices and the TA project\u2019s outputs 1, 2, and 3. The TA will help key stakeholders to enhance \ntheir knowledge on financial markets; investment instruments analysis; and capacity to assess, \nidentify, measure, develop, and manage green finance products and projects. The TA will support \nat least four workshops for knowledge exchanges and the sharing of good practice examples. \nThe output will also help design leaflets, brochures, and guides that can be used to promote green \nfinance concepts. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). \n \n15.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, access \nto needed data and printed documents, facilities for key meetings between the implementing \nagency and consultants, printing and distribution of project materials to staff, assistance in \ncoordinating meetings, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  ADB will administer the TA. The executing agency is the MOF. The implementing agency \nis the Financial Policy Department of the MOF. Coordination among regulators will be assured by \n ", "5 \nestablishing a task force comprising representatives from the MOF the MOF, Financial Regulatory \nCommission, MET, and BOM.
