INTRODUCTION \n1.  During country program discussions in 2005, governments of several Central Asian and \nSouth Caucasian countries raised the issue of the lack of information on remittances and their \nimpact  on poverty,  despite  indications  that  remittance  inflows  are  large  and  increasing.  In \nresponse, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) proposed a regional technical assistance (TA) on \nremittances and poverty in Central Asia and South Caucasus to finance a regional study.1 In \nDecember 2005, ADB missions visited Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, and \nUzbekistan to discuss key features of the proposed regional TA with the governments and other \nstakeholders. In early 2006, the governments of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, and \nTajikistan sent letters to ADB, confirming their interest in the TA and agreement with its key \nfeatures,  including  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  activities,  inputs,  costs  estimates,  and \nfinancing plan. The TA framework is given in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Remittances\u2014 funds sent by migrant workers to their relatives in home countries\u2014are \nan increasingly important source of external finance for developing countries. Formal inflows of \nremittances to developing countries in 2005 are estimated at $167 billion, twice as much as the \namount of official development aid. Many experts believe that informal flows of remittances are \nas large as formal flows.  \n \n3.  The migration process is very old. For millennia, people have moved around the world in \nsearch of better economic opportunities, and money has moved with them. In modern times, \nmigrants travel to other countries in search of better livelihoods and income to support their \nfamilies.  Migration  is  sometimes  seasonal  and  sometimes  permanent,  but  the  process  of \nsending money home persists, sometimes across generations living in the new country. Money \nis sent through a wide variety of methods both formal and informal, with varying degrees of cost \nand  reliability.  The  funds  can  mean  the  difference  between  poverty  and  prosperity  to  the \nreceiving household, and to the entire country in the case of small developing countries. The \nliterature demonstrates a growing debate over the sending systems and uses of remittances. \nHowever, all sources cite significant gaps in basic data on remittances, making both market \nimprovements and policy changes more problematic.2  \n \n4.  While studies of migration have been more detailed and focus primarily on effects in host \ncountries, links with former colonies, or known diasporas; research on remittances per se is \nmore limited in scope. Much of the research on remittances has been completed in the United \nStates and Latin America, where migration between the South and the North has been going on \nfor over a century and is increasingly well documented. Studies also focus on countries that \nsupply larger numbers of migrants, such as Bangladesh and the Philippines. Increasingly, data \non west and northern Africa joins existing work on Eastern Europe and the Pacific. These \nstudies focus primarily on quantifying fund flows and showing how funds are transmitted, as well \nas  identifying  institutional  arrangements.  Research  on  social  and  economic  effects  of \nremittances  is  a  newer  and  more  contentious  area  of  the  literature.  Both  macroeconomic \nimpacts and household effects of remittances are currently of keen interest for the concerned \n                                                 \n1  ADB Management approved the TA concept paper on 24 November 2005. The TA first appeared in ADB Business \nOpportunities on 24 January 2006. \n2  See, for example, World Bank. 2006. Global Economic Prospects: Economic Implications of Remittances and \nMigration. Washington, DC. \n ", "2     \n \ncountries  and  development  institutions.  The  results  may  provide  keys  to  mechanisms  for \nreinforcing positive impacts of remittances on economic development and poverty reduction. \n \n5.  The results of earlier research demonstrate that remittances can have significant positive \neffects on financial sector development and poverty reduction. In Guatemala, poverty incidence \nmay have declined as much as 20% due to remittances.3 Evidence suggests that households \nreceiving remittances invest more in family education, health, and nutrition. Investments in \nhousing and microenterprises are also common. Debates in the literature also focus on whether \nremittances have a more consumption or savings effect on households. In developing countries, \nthe literature suggests that remittance flows improve both understanding and access to financial \ninstitutions by more households, and encourage competition. Countries with large remittance \nflows  can  improve  access  to  international  capital  markets  by  securitizing  remittances  and \nimproving  accounting  for  them  in  balance  of  payments  accounts  and  assessments  of \ncreditworthiness. Improved data on remittance flows has stimulated a good deal of interest by \nfinancial institutions in developing competitive products for remittance transmission and savings \nand investment for households, lowering costs, and improving financial intermediation. \n \n6.  In Central Asia and South Caucasus, the emergence of newly independent states in \n1991 after the breakup of the former Soviet Union dramatically increased the movement of \npeople across new borders. The economic circumstances of households generally declined in \nthe  early  1990s  as  the  transition  processes  began,  with  widely  varying  conditions  from \nKazakhstan\u2019s oil-driven wealth to Tajikistan\u2019s significant poverty. This disparity along with the \nease of movement of citizens across member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent \nStates stimulated labor migration in search of better opportunities from poorer Central Asian and \nSouth Caucasian countries. Migrants have gone to the Russian Federation and, increasingly, \nKazakhstan. Fewer people have moved to Europe and North America.  \n \n7.  Official central bank statistics show significant amounts of formal sector funds being \ntransferred into countries\u2014up to 27% of GDP in the Kyrgyz Republic4 and 20\u201350% of GDP in \nthe case of Tajikistan.5 However, very little is known about the structure of remittance flows in \nthe region in terms of channels of remittance transfers and, perhaps more importantly, effects of \nremittances  on  poverty.  This  lack  of  information  prevents  both  governments  and  financial \ninstitutions  from  responding  with  policy  changes  and  new  products  to  increase  remittance \ninflows  and  their  positive  effects  on  financial  sector  development  and  poverty  reduction. \nAdditionally, local capacity to conduct applied research on remittances on an ongoing basis \ndoes not yet exist. Finally, regional institutions working on regional integration issues have not \nyet had sufficient information to consider regional options to improve remittance flows. To \naddress  these  concerns,  ADB\u2019s  East  and  Central  Asia  Department  and  Private  Sector \nOperations Department have jointly developed this regional TA on remittances and poverty in \nCentral Asia and South Caucasus, and initiated research collaboration with the European Bank \nfor Reconstruction and Development, International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank.6 \n                                                 \n3  Adams, Richard. 2004.

Washington, DC. \n6  The TA was designed in consultation with European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is planning \nto undertake a regional study on remittances covering Georgia, Moldova, and Tajikistan as recipient countries and \nthe Russian Federation as an origin country. Leading researchers of the International Monetary Fund and World \nBank focusing on remittances have expressed interest in participating in some of the TA activities.   \n ", "  3\n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The TA is intended to increase the positive effects of remittances on poverty in Central \nAsia and South Caucasus. The expected outcome is improved knowledge of remittance flows \nand understanding of their effects on poverty in individual Central Asian and South Caucasian \ncountries covered by the TA, and the region as a whole.7 To achieve this outcome, the TA will \nproduce the following outputs: \n \n(i)  a regional report on the financial sector and remittances in Central Asia and \nSouth Caucasus (the annotated outline of the report is in Appendix 2), and \n(ii)  a regional report on remittances and poverty in Central Asia and South Caucasus \n(the annotated outline of the report is in Appendix 2). \n9.  The reports will inform policy makers in Central Asia and South Caucasus, and help \nADB develop public and private sector projects aimed at facilitating formal remittance inflows to \nthe region, directing them to productive investments, and increasing their positive effects on \nfinancial sector development and poverty reduction. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The following activities will be undertaken to produce the TA outputs and achieve its \nexpected outcome: \n \n(i)  Draft  analytical  frameworks  for  country  reports  on  the  financial  sector  and \nremittances, and on remittances and poverty; and questionnaires for financial \nsector and household surveys on remittances. The frameworks will specify what \ndata and analysis need to be included in the country reports, how the data is to \nbe collected, and how the analysis is to be done. The frameworks will be the \nsame for all countries covered by the TA. \n(ii)  Hold the first working meeting to discuss the draft analytical frameworks and \nquestionnaires. The questionnaires will be designed to provide the data needed \nfor preparation of the country reports on the financial sector and remittances, and \non remittances and poverty. The questionnaires will be the same for all countries \ncovered by the TA. \n(iii)  Revise and finalize the draft analytical frameworks and questionnaires, taking \ninto account discussions at the first working meeting. \n(iv)  Conduct a financial sector survey on remittances in all countries covered by the \nTA and process survey results. \n(v)  Prepare the preliminary draft of the country reports on the financial sector and \nremittances (excluding sections to be based on household survey results). \n                                                 \n7  The TA  will cover Armenia, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan. Uzbekistan  will be included if its \nGovernment expresses interest in the TA before implementation starts.  \n ", "4     \n \n(vi)  Conduct a pilot household survey on remittances in all countries covered by the \nTA, revise the survey questionnaire as needed, and prepare interviewers for a \nfull-fledged survey. \n(vii)  Conduct a household survey on remittances in all countries covered by the TA \nand process survey results. \n(viii)  Prepare  the  first  draft  of  the  country  reports  on  the  financial  sector  and \nremittances (including the sections to be based on household survey results). \n(ix)  Prepare the first draft of the country reports on remittances and poverty. \n(x)  Discuss the first draft of the country reports with key stakeholders in the countries \nconcerned. \n(xi)  Prepare the second draft of the country reports, taking into account discussions \nwith stakeholders. \n(xii)  Prepare  the  first  draft  of  the  regional  reports  on  the  financial  sector  and \nremittances, and on remittances and poverty using country reports. \n(xiii)  Hold the second working meeting to discuss the first draft of the regional reports. \n(xiv)  Prepare the second draft of the regional reports, taking into account discussions \nheld at the second working meeting. \n(xv)  Have the second draft of the regional reports reviewed by key stakeholders and \npeer reviewers. \n(xvi)  Prepare the third draft of the regional reports, taking into account comments \nmade by stakeholders and peer reviewers. \n(xvii)  Publish and start disseminating the regional reports. \n11.  Most of these activities will be undertaken in collaboration with local research institutions \nfrom the countries covered by the TA. The TA will, therefore, help build local capacity for applied \nresearch  on  remittances  and  strengthen  links  between  research  institutions  from  various \ncountries of Central Asia and South Caucasus.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,300,000.8 The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund administered by ADB ($1,000,000) and \nADB's TA funding program ($300,000). Detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The East and Central Asia Department \nand the Private Sector Operations Department will jointly implement the TA; an implementation \n                                                 \n8  The cost estimates and implementation arrangements are based on the assumption that the TA will cover \nUzbekistan. \n ", "  5\n \nteam  will  be  set  up  comprising  staff  members  of  both  departments  and  international  and \ndomestic consultants. The TA will be implemented over 22 months, from May 2006 to March \n2008. TA implementation will be closely coordinated with the European Bank for Reconstruction \nand Development to avoid duplication and achieve synergy with its study on remittances. \n \n14.  The services of 2 international consultants for a total of 17 person-months and of 11 \ndomestic consultants for a total of 127 person-months will be required. An international expert in \nfinance and remittances (8 person-months) will develop an analytical framework for country \nreports on the financial sector and remittances, design a questionnaire for a financial sector \nsurvey on remittances, and draft the regional report on the financial sector and remittances. An \ninternational expert in remittances and poverty (9 person-months) will develop an analytical \nframework  for  country  reports  on  remittances  and  poverty,  design  a  questionnaire  for  a \nhousehold survey on remittances, and draft the regional report on remittances and poverty. One \ndomestic expert in finance and remittances (9 person-months) will be engaged in each of the \ncountries covered by the TA to conduct a financial sector survey on remittances and prepare a \ncountry report on the financial sector and remittances. One domestic expert in remittances and \npoverty (12 person-months) will be engaged in each country to conduct a household survey on \nremittances and prepare a country report on remittances and poverty. One domestic consultant \nwill be engaged at ADB headquarters to serve as research assistant (22 person-months). The \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are given in Appendix 4. \n \n15.  ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with the  Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  and  Its  Borrowers  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The international consultants \nwill  be  engaged  as  individuals.  In  countries  covered  by  the  TA  that  have  local  research \ninstitutions with a good track record of implementing similar projects, one of these institutions \nwill be engaged in each country, using the consultants\u2019 qualification selection procedure to \nprovide domestic consulting services. In the other countries covered by the TA and at ADB \nheadquarters, the domestic consultants will be engaged as individuals. \n \n16.  The TA outputs will be widely disseminated. In particular, the regional reports on the \nfinancial sector and remittances in Central Asia and South Caucasus, and remittances and \npoverty in Central Asia and South Caucasus will be featured in ADB's web site. They will also \nbe presented to key stakeholders at seminars and conferences, printed, and widely distributed. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, and (ii) ADB providing \nthe balance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 on a grant basis, for Remittances and \nPoverty in Central Asia and South Caucasus, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumptions \nGreater positive effects  Increased inflows of  Data on remittance inflows  Policy makers and financial \nof remittances on  remittances to the Central  collected by central banks of  institutions in Central Asia and \npoverty in Central Asia  Asian and South Caucasian  the Central Asian and South  South Caucasus will use the \nand South Caucasus  countries through formal  Caucasian countries  knowledge generated by the TA \n  channels     to facilitate remittance transfers \n    through formal channels. \n     \nIncreased use of  Household surveys  Policy makers in Central Asia \nremittances by recipient  conducted by state statistics  and South Caucasus will use the \nhouseholds for productive  services of the Central Asian  knowledge generated by the TA \ninvestments, such as  and South Caucasian  to take measures that will help \ninvestment in health,  countries   direct more remittances into \neducation, and small  productive investment. \nbusinesses   \nOutcome      Assumption \nBetter knowledge of  Estimates of remittance    Measures taken during the \nremittance flows and  flows in individual Central    design and conduct of financial \ntheir effects on poverty  Asian and South Caucasian    sector and household surveys \nin individual Central  countries by origin countries,    will be enough to obtain complete \nAsian and South  transfer channels, and    and truthful answers from most \nCaucasian countries  recipient household groups    respondents. \nand the region as a       \nwhole, leading to better  Detailed information on main   \ndecision making by  channels of remittance   \ngovernments and  transfers to Central Asia and   \nprivate sectors in this  South Caucasus   \narea     Regional reports \nAn in-depth analysis of the  produced under the TA \neffects of remittances on \npoverty in individual \nrecipient countries and the \nregion as a whole \n \nPolicy and project \nrecommendations to \nenhance positive effects of \nremittances on poverty in \nCentral Asia and South \nCaucasus \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
