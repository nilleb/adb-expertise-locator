THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \n \nA.  Analysis of Key Issues \n \n1.  Asia and the Pacific has made progress in some areas of gender equality, yet important \ngaps remain in education completion, health outcomes, employment, and participation and \nleadership in decision-making. As a key driver of growth and an engine for 90% of jobs in \ndeveloping countries, the private sector represents a source of opportunities to drive greater \ngender equality.1  Seeking to increase gender equality through business is not only the right thing \nto do, it is the smart thing to do. Gender equality is critical to business performance and \nsustainable economic growth. Diversity in businesses has been estimated to result in about 21% \nhigher profitability than companies with low gender diversity on their executive teams.2 Internships, \nmentoring programs and networking platforms are shown to drive productivity in a range of areas \nincluding  increased  female  entrepreneurship,  women\u2019s  greater  participation  in  science, \ntechnology, engineering and mathematics, and increased access to leadership opportunities. \nHuman resources policies on diversity and work flexibility provide opportunities to transform \ngender norms for mothers and fathers while contributing to greater income security, career \ndevelopment and job opportunities. Corporate practices on zero tolerance for gender-based \nviolence  and  harassment  increase  profitability  by  reducing  turnover,  increasing  worker \nproductivity and increasing company access to the entire talent pool, while also reducing barriers \nfor women in the workplace.3  \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) \naims to achieve effective gender mainstreaming in alignment with ADB Strategy 20304 and ADB \nOperational Plan for Priority 2 (OP2) Accelerating Progress in Gender Equality, 2019\u201320245 \nwhich sets ambitious at-entry targets according to its gender categorization system.6  \n \n3.  Historically in PSOD, the financial and agribusiness sectors - followed by the education \nsector - account for the majority of transactions with the greatest number of development \nindicators aimed at reducing inequalities or accelerating progress in gender equality. However, \nnon-traditional sectors such as information, communication and technology, and energy are \nbecoming increasingly more gender-sensitive. Likewise, more efforts are being made to further \nimprove gender mainstreaming across all sectors of PSOD operations, including transport, private \nequity financing and manufacturing. Furthermore, enhancing gender outcomes is being taken into \n \n1 UN Global Compact Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles. COVID-19 and Gender Equality: a Call to Action for the \nPrivate Sector.

Manila.  \n6 All ADB operations are classified into one of the four gender categories: gender equity theme, effective gender \nmainstreaming, some gender elements, and no gender elements. The gender categories are defined in ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Gender Mainstreaming Categories of ADB Projects (2012) and the gender targets are further \ndescribed in ADB Strategy 2030 Operational Plan For Priority 2 Accelerating Progress In Gender Equality, 2019\u2013\n2024 (2019). \n ", "3 \naccount both in new business developments and investment programs, for example under climate \nfinance, venture financing, and digital finance.  \n \n4.  It is anticipated that greater consideration to include gender measures in PSOD\u2019s 2020 \npipeline7 and beyond will continue, notably with enhanced ADB resources through the recently \ncreated PSOD Gender Team.8 \n \nB.  Justification for Cluster Modality \n \n5.  PSOD has access to a number of financial  sources which seek to support gender \ninitiatives. These financial sources have been secured through a range of financing vehicles which \nneed to be programmed in order to be utilized. PSOD\u2019s Gender Team seeks to pool these funds \nunder the umbrella of a transactional technical assistance project (TA) to ensure coordination and \nmanagement  of  these  funds.  Secured  sources  of  funding  initially  include  the  Women \nEntrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi), the Australian Climate Finance Partnership (ACFP) and \nthe ADB Ventures Financing Partnership Facility9 (see Appendix 1 on funding sources by TA \nsubproject). The objectives of each financing source will be presented in the respective sub-\nprojects, which will be processed in accordance with the interests and agreements of the funding \nsource. \n \n6.  The transaction TA cluster will provide capacity building support to PSOD programs and \nprojects with adequate resources to develop capacities and  knowledge in response to the greater \nattention given by international development partners and finance institutions, including ADB, to \na more systematic inclusion of measures supporting gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment \nas part of private sector development projects. As such, the TA cluster proposes to (i) support \nprivate sector projects categorized as Effective Gender Mainstreaming or Gender Equity Theme \nunder ADB categorization system to implement their gender action plans; (ii) increase women\u2019s \naccess to finance in the Pacific for women\u2019s businesses through the WAVES Program; (iii) \nenhance  gender  mainstreaming  in  climate  finance  projects  under  the  ACFP;  (iv)  develop \nknowledge and tools to promote gender-lens financing by financial institutions; and (v) enhance \ngender  mainstreaming  in  venture  capital  financing  operations.  Further  details  on  these \nsubprojects are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nC.  Outcome and Outputs \n \n7.  Overall outcome. The TA cluster will have the following overall outcome: improved quality \nof gender responsiveness in private sector investments. \n \n8.  Each TA subproject will generally deliver all or some of the following outputs, as to be \nspecified by each transaction TA subproject proposal. \n \n9.  Output  1:  Improved  capacities  of  ADB  private  sector  clients  to  develop  and \nimplement gender mainstreaming initiatives and gender action plans (delivered under \nsubprojects 1, 2, 3 and 4). The TA will increase PSOD\u2019s clients\u2019 understanding of how gender \nmainstreaming applies to their business and will enhance their ability to develop more gender \nequitable business offerings, more conducive work environment for gender equality and women\u2019s \n \n7 ADB. July 2020. Private Sector Operations in 2019 Report on Development Effectiveness. Manila \n8 PSOD recruited its first Gender Advisor in August 2019.  As of July 2020, PSOD\u2019s Gender Team is composed of two \nInternational Gender Specialist staff and three gender consultants, with the support of Gender Champions from \nPSOD staff). \n9 ADB Ventures Financing Partnership Facility \n ", "4 \n \nempowerment.  Capacity  building  will  also  be  provided  to  improve  on their monitoring  and \nreporting of gender action plans.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Increased capacity of ADB Private Sector Investment Programs to deliver \ntransformational, industry-specific gender measures (delivered under subprojects 3, 4 and \n5). Targeted programs here include sector-specific financing programs established under PSOD, \nin particular but not limited to the microfinance, climate finance and venture finance facilities. The \nTA will serve to support these programs to better integrate gender elements into their project \nidentification and project designs. Capacity building activities under this output may consist of (i) \nsupport to PSOD investment teams during project preparation and due diligence to strengthen \nthe gender value proposition and (ii) guidelines development on gender mainstreaming in targeted \nindustries to better inform the gender design.  \n \n11.  Output 3: Enhanced business and other skills of women-owned small and medium-\nsized enterprises (delivered under subprojects 2, 3 and 4). Tailored training, business mentoring \nor other support will be applied to assist women to grow more profitable businesses. The TA will \nlook at introducing innovative business practices such as the use of digital tools and solutions to \nbring  value  to  the  enterprise,  drive  operational  efficiency,  and  open  new  opportunities  for \nexpansion and scale. The TA will provide targeted networking and mentoring opportunities, \ninformation and awareness-raising workshops, or other forms of capacity building in areas \nrelevant to women to increase their business resilience, work-family balance and reinforce the \ncross-functional capacities for their economic empowerment.  \n \n12.  Output 4: Generation of knowledge (delivered under subprojects 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5). The \nTA will support the development of knowledge products which may include case studies, tip \nsheets, guidance notes, research papers, blog posts, market analysis or electronic materials \n(including videos) on relevant topics, sectors or countries. The knowledge products may also \ninclude training, communication and marketing materials for use in implementing gender action \nplans. Under this output, support to ADB private sector stakeholders will be considered as \nresource persons in peer-learning summits and external forums to strengthen their gender \nawareness and promote skills-transfer knowledge.  \n \nD.  Cost and Indicative Financing \n \n13.  The TA cluster is expected not to exceed $5,000,000. It will be financed on a grant-basis \nby multiple donors, including but not limited to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF), \nWe-Fi and ACFP. Detailed cost estimates and financing arrangements will be presented in each \nTA subproject proposal submitted for approval. ADB will seek cost-matching from its clients, \nwhere possible. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  The TA cluster will run for an initial period of five years from January 2021 to December \n2025. The gender team in ADB\u2019s Private Sector Technical Support division will administer the TA \ncluster. The TA will be applied to activities across all PSOD divisions. Some subprojects may be \nimplemented by another PSOD division. A OneADB approach will be sought when applicable, \nnotably in the implementation of the TA subproject 1 to encourage exchanges across fields of \nexpertise to capitalize on ADB knowledge of effective gender mainstreaming across countries \nand sectors. Implementation details will be presented in each subproject as they are prepared. \nEach TA subproject proposal will be submitted for approval to Director General, PSOD, in \naccordance with the business process for transaction TA cluster processing.  \n ", "5 \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  January 2021 \u2013 December 2025  \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nImplementing agencies  Private Sector Operations Department, Transaction Support Division \nConsultants  Package title  Selection method  Engaged by  \nTA Program Coordinator  individual selection  Asian Development Bank, \nSubproject 1 \nGender Specialists in  Individual selection*  Asian Development Bank, \nwomen\u2019s economic  Subproject 1 \n \nempowerment, human \nresources management,  * a firm can be \ntraining facilitation and  envisaged using quality-\nM&E  cost based selection \nmethod \nGender Specialists in  Individual selection  Asian Development Bank, \nWSME and Financial  Subproject 2 \nSector Development \nGender and Climate  Individual selection  Asian Development Bank, \nChange Financing  Subproject 3 \nSpecialist \nGender Specialist in  Individual selection  Asian Development Bank, \nFinancial Sector  Subproject 4 \nDevelopment \nGender Specialist in  Individual selection  Asian Development Bank, \nGender Lens investing /  Subproject 5 \nAlternative Financial \nMarkets \nAdvance contracting and  Use of advance contracting or retroactive financing will be specified in each subproject \nretroactive financing  proposal, if necessary.
