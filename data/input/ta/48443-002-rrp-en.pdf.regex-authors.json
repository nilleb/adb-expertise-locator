THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Hunan Xiangjiang River Watershed Existing Solid \nWaste Comprehensive Treatment Project. \n \n2.  The project will address urgent environmental and infrastructure needs associated with \nmunicipal solid waste (MSW) management in 10 counties and county-level cities in the Xiangjiang \nRiver watershed of Hunan Province.1 It is a milestone for the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nbecause it will be the first in the PRC to focus solely on MSW management. It will also complement \nthe government\u2019s efforts to align MSW services with sustainable development. It will support \noverall  strategies  to  reduce  the  discharge  of  long-term  pollutants  in  the  Xiangjiang  River \nwatershed and has significant potential for wide replication. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The Xiangjiang River and its watershed are part of the larger Dongting Lake watershed. \nBoth watersheds are integral elements of the downstream Yangtze River watershed. The Yangtze \nRiver Economic Belt (YREB) covers nine provinces and two specially administered cities in the \nYangtze River Basin. It accounts for over 40% of the PRC\u2019s population and has 40% of the \nfreshwater resources. It also serves as the drinking water resource for 400 million people, \nprovides 60% of the total fisheries production, has 20% of the total wetland area, and contributes \nabout 45% of the PRC\u2019s economic output. The PRC\u2019s YREB Development Plan, 2016\u20132030,2 \nstipulates the prioritization of ecological protection and promotion of green development as the \nguiding principle for the YREB development. As upstream watersheds, the Xiangjiang River and \nDongting Lake play a pivotal role in the water quality of the Yangtze River watershed and in the \ngeneral maintenance of healthy rivers and waterways. Therefore, the Xiangjiang River watershed \nis a key water resource in the overall strategic planning for water security in the Yangtze River, \nand its ecological improvement in turn promotes ecosystem restoration, environmental protection, \nand water resources management of the YREB and its watersheds.  \n \n4.  The Xiangjiang River watershed has a total area of about 94,660 square kilometers, with \napproximately 90% of it located in Hunan and the remaining 10% located in the Guangxi Province. \nThe  economic  activity  and  expansion  of  the  human-made  surroundings  have  extensively \ndeveloped  the  Xiangjiang  River  watershed.  By  2017,  approximately  61%  of  Hunan\u2019s  total \npopulation, or about 25.1 million people, lived within the watershed. The total gross domestic \nproduct for the Xiangjiang River watershed in 2017 was estimated to be 75% of the overall total \ngross domestic product of Hunan Province. The rapid economic growth experienced countrywide \nfrom  the  mid-1980s  until  the  present,  coupled  with  inadequate  environmental  protection, \ncontributes to the deterioration of the environment and the increased pollution in Hunan and the \nXiangjiang River watershed. By 2000, the surface water of the Xiangjiang River, which met class \nIII quality or better, was less than 70% along the entire river system.3 Based on the PRC drinking \nwater code, water along most reaches of the Xiangjiang River did not meet the standards to be \n                                                 \n1  The project includes the (i) five counties of Dong\u2019an, Guiyang, Hengshan, Hengyang, and Lanshan; and (ii) five \ncounty-level cities of Changning, Leiyang, Lengshuijiang, Yongzhou, and Zixing.  \n2  Government of the PRC. 2016. Outline of the Yangtze River Economic Belt Development Plan, 2016\u20132030. Beijing. \n3  Government of the PRC, Ministry of Environmental Protection. 2002. Environmental Quality Standards for Surface \nWater. Beijing. There are five categories, with Class I being the highest quality of water and class V being the lowest \nquality. Class III is the minimum that can be used as a bulk source of raw water for production of drinking water. ", "2 \nused as a source for raw water. The pollution in the Xiangjiang River had negative impacts on \nliving standards and the health of residents living around the river. The pollution was recognized \nby the government as a threat to the long-term sustainable growth of industry along the river, an \nimpediment to the maintenance of overall river health, a material risk to the strategic supplies for \ndownstream drinking water, and an unacceptable visual intrusion on the watershed's well-\nrecognized cultural attraction. \n \n5.  The  main  sectors  responsible  for  the  Xiangjiang  River  watershed\u2019s  environmental \ndegradation  are  industry,  agriculture,  and  domestic  (with  domestic  sources  being  primarily \nmunicipal  wastewater  and  MSW).  In  the  period  2000\u20132017,  the  government  adopted  an \nintegrated approach to pollution control to protect water quality in the Xiangjiang River watershed. \nIn 2011, the Hunan Provincial Government (HPG) initiated a major program of environmental \npollution control to target the major pollution sources.4 Subsequent environmental regulations and \nincremental enforcement in Hunan have reduced the impacts from industrial and agricultural \nsources, and new wastewater treatment plants have reduced pollution from untreated sewage. \nHowever,  significant  challenges  remain  regarding  MSW.  Urbanization  has  left  a  legacy  of \nsubstandard landfill sites that were once in outlying rural areas and are now located close to newly \ncreated urban areas. Much of the countryside has been urbanized and has become part of the \nbuilt environment of the counties and county-level cities. With the expansion of MSW services \nbeing limited in these areas, the challenge of managing MSW in a sustainable manner has grown. \n \n6.  Addressing the poor management of substandard landfill sites.5 Aging landfill sites, \nwhich are generally no longer receiving any MSW, are one of the last remaining long-term sources \nof pollution that have not yet been fully addressed in Hunan. Most of these landfill sites are \nreferred  to  as  substandard  MSW  landfills,  or  dumpsites,  meaning  they  were  not  planned, \nengineered, constructed, or operated to appropriate standards. They have been left untreated or \npartially sealed at various locations. They are typically closed in an operational sense. However, \nthey  have  not  been  closed  and  restored  in  accordance  with  the  best  practice  for \ndecommissioning.6 Because they were not closed competently, liquid leachate continues to \npollute surface water and groundwater and the waste is also releasing landfill gas.7 The liquid \nleachate and waste contribute to long-term pollution of the river system and downstream water \nquality by raising the biological and chemical oxygen demands, while gross pollution of the soil \nbelow the landfills remains unchecked. Without any form of managed closure, they will continue \nto generate leachate. The landfills pose risks to the health and well-being of people living near \nthem and are a safety risk to anyone accessing them. HPG has identified 59 landfills in the \nwatershed to be treated and improved by county and county-level city governments.8 While some \nlandfills have been treated under domestically funded projects, there are still untreated sites that \ncontinue to generate leachate when rainfall and runoff infiltrates the solid waste body, further \ngenerating leachate from the natural process of waste decomposition. \n \n                                                 \n4  HPG. 2011. Heavy Metal Pollution Management Project Implementation Plan in the Xiangjiang River Basin: 2011\u2013\n2015. Changsha. \n5  Before the mid-1980s, disposal of MSW in Hunan was rarely managed in accordance with best practice, and formal \nservices were rare. MSW was typically disposed of in so-called substandard landfill sites. The sites have become \ncontaminated resulting from gradual decomposition of buried waste, with consequent degradation of soil and water. \n6  Closure and restoration is an MSW industry recognized term, which describes the process of closing a site from an \nengineering and environmental perspective, including a process of restoration using agreed design standards for \nfuture land use. It is not operational closure of a landfill site whereupon materials are no longer delivered to the site. \n7  As waste within a landfill decomposes, it generates leachate which is a highly polluting liquid contaminant. \n8  Hunan Provincial Housing and Urban\u2013Rural Development Department (HURD). 2014.

Efficient MSW management, which promotes reduction (by waste minimization), reuse (of \nwaste  materials),  recycling,  and  recovery,  is  gaining  ground  in  the  PRC.  However,  the \nmanagement and disposal of MSW generated in rural areas is underdeveloped and inadequate. \nMost waste is randomly dumped onto open areas without treatment. In some cases, it is burned \nopenly, generating polluting emissions. Randomly dumped MSW allows waste to break down and \ndecompose without the means to prevent leachate from percolating into the groundwater or \nflowing into surface water bodies; indiscriminately dumped MSW can clog streams and drains. In \nthe PRC, MSW management focuses on urban areas. For vast rural areas, the management of \ndomestic waste is delegated to villagers. In 2016, HPG commenced the implementation of a five-\nyear plan for rural MSW treatment, which targeted the achievement of at least 70% of rural waste \nbeing treated by 2020.9 This builds on rigorous national guidance on controlled treatment and \ndisposal  of  MSW.10 It  supports  the  3-year  Action  Plan  for  Rural  Settlement  Environment \nRegulation  in  Hunan  Province  issued  by  HPG  in  2018  which  requires  comprehensive \nimplementation of enhanced services for rural sewage and waste treatment. In the rural areas of \nHunan, there has been some progress despite remaining limited and inconsistent. \n \n8.  Expansion of municipal solid waste to include collection and treatment of kitchen \nwaste. HPG is also promoting the treatment of kitchen waste from commercial sources, which is \ntypically disposed of in landfills or in small dumpsites without treatment. However, because of its \nhigh water and protein content, kitchen waste tends to generate more leachate and greenhouse \ngas emissions than other MSW. There is concern about unregulated kitchen waste handling \nregarding food safety and its impacts on human health.11 According to a proposal raised in the \nHunan People\u2019s Congress,12 eight kitchen waste management projects have been proposed to \nrecover by-products for beneficial reuse, with due regard to public health and overall food safety. \n \n9.  Strategic context. In the PRC's Thirteenth Five-Year Plan, the government\u2019s strategy is \nto intensify the control of water pollution and the protection of key watersheds.13 This includes the \necological restoration of resource-depleted areas and the promotion of treating pollutants in \ncontaminated river basins. HPG is committed to meeting these obligations and to eliminating or \nminimizing  pollutants.  It  has  prioritized  reducing  long-term  pollution  and  promoting  the \ncomprehensive  treatment  and  effective  management  of  MSW.14 HPG  focuses  on  landfill \nmanagement and MSW collection, transfer, and treatment in urban and rural areas. \n   \n10.  ADB support. The project demonstrates alignment with the operational priorities of ADB \nStrategy 2030 particularly in terms of environmental sustainability and integrated solutions for \nlivable cities. It closely supports the strategic priorities set out in ADB\u2019s country partnership \n                                                 \n9  HURD. 2016.

This dialogue has contributed to an enabling \nenvironment that has facilitated policy, regulatory, and operational improvements. Starting in \n2000, ADB supported the government in strengthening urban MSW through technical assistance \nprojects, which helped develop a national policy framework and plans for MSW and wastewater \nmanagement, focusing on small cities and towns. ADB has also provided specific support for the \ntreatment  of  substandard  landfills  in  the  PRC  and  for  the  environmental  management  of \nwatersheds in Hunan. The project supports HPG\u2019s approach to urban\u2013rural integrated MSW \nmanagement, which seeks to address the entire cycle of MSW starting in households with \ncollecting, separating, and recycling; and continuing in counties and cities with transferring and \ntreating the remaining wastes. It covers a large population and various levels of government \nagencies. The engagement with multiple agencies is designed to drive ownership and build wide-\nranging capacity at the lowest administrative level and act as a model project. \n \n11.  Value addition of ADB assistance. The PRC has adequate policies and regulations for \nMSW management to which ADB knowledge studies and technical assistance have contributed.16 \nThe implementation of these policies in rural areas, counties, and county-level cities has been a \nconstant challenge. HPG recognizes this and has requested ADB\u2019s support to develop an \ninvestment project in rural and urban\u2013rural areas, which is intended to show how policy and \nregulations can be translated into projects that follow best practices. This is intended to keep from \nduplicating past practices of low-cost interventions that deliver substandard outcomes. This builds \non lessons from ADB\u2019s past engagements, showing the demand for clear statements on best \npractice  and  for  robust  technical  guidance  and  support.  ADB\u2019s  presence  offers  a  unique \nopportunity to deliver numerous projects under one overarching project, wholly focused on MSW, \nto allow collaboration and comparative assessment. ADB\u2019s focused support on a chronically \nunderserved sector allows it to be comprehensively addressed. ADB\u2019s engagement assists the \ngovernment in the last stage of providing MSW services and in addressing overlooked aging \nlandfills. The government and ADB have designed the project collaboratively to have a sharper \nfocus on consistent, effective, and innovative approaches with a high potential for replication, \nbased on the best international and national practices. This enhanced design development \nbroadened the project\u2019s scope while adopting more holistic and strategic approaches, leading to \nimproved MSW service outcomes and the adoption of appropriate high-level technologies with \nlarge-scale demonstration potential, including (i) practical and environmentally sound approaches \nto landfill closure and restoration, building on recent codes of practice;17 (ii) robust operational \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2016.

DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n23.  Technical due diligence included a review of the feasibility study report, preliminary \nengineering designs, and cost estimates. The appraisal included a consideration of rationale and \nrelevance, benefits, proposed designs, life cycle costs, capital and operational expenditure, and \nease of implementation and operation. The due diligence confirmed the project is technically \nfeasible and addresses key issues and complies with the PRC guidelines and regulations. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n24.  Economic analysis.27 An economic analysis was prepared for the overall project and all \nsubprojects following ADB guidelines. The benefits considered are (i) improved environment and \nhealth valued by project beneficiaries\u2019 willingness to pay for landfill works and MSW services, \n(ii) reduced health risks measured by savings in disability-adjusted life years, and (iii) the resale \nvalue of waste byproducts.28 The estimated economic internal rates of return are 15.3% for the \nproject and 10.8%\u201319.7% for the individual subprojects, higher than the economic opportunity \ncost of capital estimated at 9.0%, indicating significant economic returns. A sensitivity analysis \nconfirms rates remain robust under various downward risk scenarios, with the project likely to be \neconomically viable even under combined risk scenarios because unquantifiable benefits were \nnot included in the analysis.29 \n \n25.  Financial analysis.30 A financial analysis was prepared for the overall project and all \nsubprojects following ADB guidelines, which included the financial evaluation of the revenue-\ngenerating components and assessments of financial management and sustainability.31 The \nfinancial evaluation result indicated that only the kitchen waste and three out of the seven MSW \ncomponents are financially viable because Hunan municipalities are still embedding the MSW fee \nin the water bill;32 for these four, the financial internal rates of return (4.02%\u20135.22%) are higher \nthan the respective weighted average costs of capital (2.76%\u20133.11%). The municipalities will fund \nthe financial gap to cover the O&M costs of the components. Financial sustainability was based \non the fiscal impact of (i) counterpart funding; and (ii) incremental recurrent costs, including O&M \nexpenditure. The analysis confirmed the financial sustainability of the project, with fiscal impacts, \nwell within the governments\u2019 projected revenue capacities. \n \nC.  Governance \n \n26.  A financial management assessment was conducted for the Hunan Provincial Housing \nand  Urban\u2013Rural  Development  Department  (HURD)  and  the  implementing  agencies.  The \nfinancial  management  risk  is  moderate  mainly  because  of  the  (i)  financial  position  of  the \nimplementing agencies to independently finance counterpart funding; (ii) project management \n                                                 \n27 Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n28 During implementation, the final determination will be made on the type of commercial product to be developed for \nresale.

In rural areas, fees are not typically collected, and services are provided by municipal governments. \n \n ", "9 \noffice and implementing agencies\u2019 unfamiliarity with ADB financial management policy and \nprocedures; and (iii) implementing agencies\u2019 lack of accounting staff for review procedures. A \nprocurement capacity assessment concluded that the overall procurement risk for the project is \nmoderate. The project is not the first externally financed development project in Hunan. However, \nit is the first for HURD and all of the implementing agencies except for Zixing. HURD confirmed it \nwill receive advice and support from other HPG agencies, which have experience implementing \nADB projects. The procurement of civil works and goods, including the recruitment of consultants, \nwill follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from time to time) and Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time).33 \n \n27.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and HURD. The specific policy requirements and supplementary measures \nare described in the PAM (footnote 26). \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n28.  The project will directly provide benefits to the project communities by (i) improving the \nliving conditions and public health of residents, (ii) enhancing awareness of sustainable MSW \nmanagement, and (iii) providing access to employment opportunities created by the project. \n \n29.  The project is categorized as some gender elements. The social and gender impact \nassessment showed that since women are responsible for cleaning, laundry, food preparation, \nand overall family and environmental health, they are more exposed to health risks and they carry \nthe burden of personal and family illness. A social and gender action plan has been prepared to \nensure that (i) women are continuously consulted, and gender concerns and suggestions are \nincorporated  in  the  design  and  implementation  of  MSW  systems;  (ii)  women  are  actively \nparticipating in community awareness raising, education programs, and training on the 3Rs \nprinciple; and (iii) project benefits are maximized by providing better access to employment \nopportunities associated with the project. The social and gender action plan aims to minimize \nhealth risks and sexual harassment during construction by including clauses in the contracts to \nlimit HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections and to prohibit sexual harassment. This \nwill be supported by robust activities to prevent HIV/AIDS, sexually transmitted infections, and \nsexual harassment and complemented by a carefully targeted education campaign. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n30.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.34 \n \n31.  Environment (category A). The project is classified category A for environment. An \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA), including an environmental management plan (EMP), \nwas prepared by HURD.35 The EIA incorporated findings of the domestic feasibility study and \ndomestic EIAs, climate risks and vulnerability assessment, biodiversity assessment, site visits, \nand consultations with stakeholders. The EIA identified potential direct, indirect, cumulative, and \ninduced environmental impacts and risks for preconstruction, construction, and operation phases \nof the project.36 The EMP identifies the avoidance of adverse impacts through design and site \n                                                 \n33 During implementation, the executing agency will have the option to change to ADB\u2019s new Procurement Framework. \n34 ADB. Safeguard Categories. https://www.adb.org/site/safeguards/safeguard-categories. \n35 The EIA main report, with appendixes 1\u20133, was disclosed on 25 May 2018, and appendix 4 on 28 May 2018. \n36 These include anticipated impacts from excavation; handling of leachate and solid waste; groundwater and surface \nwater pollution; and closure of landfill sites with potential for air, soil, and water pollution. \n ", "10 \nmanagement and mitigation measures under construction management. The landfill closures and \nnew MSW systems have been considered in detail, including potential impacts for landfill gas \ncollection and treatment. During the EIA process, HURD conducted an assessment to determine \nthe significance of project impacts and risks on biodiversity and natural resources, and the EMP \nincludes adequate measures to avoid, minimize, or mitigate potential impacts and risks. The \nclimate change assessment (para. 33) identified precipitation and flooding as the most important \nrisks affecting the project, and key recommendations have been incorporated in the EMP. \n \n32.  The EMP includes a plan for internal monitoring to be conducted by contractors during \nconstruction and by O&M units during operation. The project management office will recruit an \nexternal monitoring entity to evaluate and assess implementation and compliance with the EMP \nduring all stages of the project.37 Environmental management, and capacity development and \ninstitutional strengthening activities are included under the project to mitigate risks. Two rounds \nof meaningful consultations have been conducted with all relevant stakeholders during project \npreparation,  and  the  findings  have  been  incorporated  in  the  project  design.  Any  potential \nenvironmental complaints or disputes will be handled in accordance with the grievance redress \nmechanism established for the project. The EIA concluded that the anticipated environmental \nimpacts and risks can be mitigated to acceptable levels by adherence to prescribed training and \ncapacity-building measures and effective implementation of the EMP. \n \n33.  Climate change assessment. According to defined projections for 2046\u20132065 and 2081\u2013\n2100 and the global climate model representative concentration pathways, the major climate risk \nfor the project is intense precipitation, with more frequent flooding.38 Although the behavior of \nlandfill emissions under regular operating conditions is well known, it is unclear how they behave \nduring flood events. During such events, closed and operational landfills may release pollutants \noriginally entombed in the waste body. Project outputs 1, 2, and 3 are an investment response to \nthe climate vulnerability of the watershed, and these adaptation measures will reduce the risk of \npollutant diffusion in extreme climatic events, mainly flooding.39 \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category B). The project will require the acquisition of about \n23.5 ha of land for the project facilities. Based on the principle of avoiding, if not minimizing, \nimpacts and, in consultation with the communities, only three households will be marginally \naffected because of the partial loss of their garden and forest lands. The rest of the facilities will \nbe located on common land (wasteland or unallocated arable and forest land) owned by villagers. \nThere will be no impact on houses or structures except for one abandoned village office. There \nare six resettlement plans that have been prepared in accordance with the PRC laws and \nregulations, and ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. For the existing waste transfer stations, \nlandfill sites, and kitchen waste sites, due diligence has been completed and no outstanding issue \nwas found. \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples (category B). In the project areas, there are 0.64 million ethnic \nminorities, accounting for 10% of the total ethnic minority population in Hunan. The Miao, Yao, \nand Zhuang are the main ethnic minority groups that are concentrated in the remote upland areas \nof Lanshan County under the prefecture of Yongzhou City. There will be no adverse impact on \nethnic minorities (i.e., no involuntary resettlements and no impact on ethnic minorities\u2019 beliefs, \n                                                 \n37 More comprehensive site assessment and monitoring will be conducted during detailed design to characterize the \nwaste and to monitor groundwater quality and soil contamination in and around the landfill sites. \n38 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 2014.
