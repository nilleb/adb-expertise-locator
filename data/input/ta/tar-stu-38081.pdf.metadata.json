Road crashes are increasing rapidly in most developing countries of Asia. A World \nHealth Organization (WHO) analysis indicates that about 500,000 people are killed in road \ncrashes in Asia each year.1 Thus, Asia produces approximately 44% of the world\u2019s road deaths, \ndespite having only 16% of the vehicle fleet. Fatality rates are excessive, frequently exceeding \nby 20\u201330 times those recorded in the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development (OECD). Trend data shows that the number of people killed annually in road \ncrashes in Asia continues to increase, while OECD countries have seen a steady decline. \nMoreover,  the  experience  in  OECD  countries  suggests  that  many  road  accidents  are \npreventable.  \n \n2.  With rapid motorization in Asia, road safety has become a significant sector issue. \nDespite efforts in some countries to address the road safety problem, information and data on \nthe adverse impacts of road crashes are scarce. Crash statistics in most developing member \ncountries  (DMCs)  are  poor,  and  often  significantly  underreport  the  number  of  deaths  and \ninjuries. However, available data indicates that the majority of crashes involve pedestrians in \nrural areas. The poor face significantly higher risks of being involved in road accidents because \nthey tend to live and work adjacent to roads and form the bulk of pedestrians. Many are heads \nof households, and their deaths often significantly reduce family incomes. Serious injuries have \nalso  long-term  impacts  on  household  incomes  for  low-income  households,  and  can  have \nserious consequences on the household quality of life. While road crashes and poverty appear \nto be strongly linked, little empirical evidence is available on the socioeconomic impact of road \ncrashes.  To  investigate  the  relationship  between  road  crashes  and  poverty,  the  United \nKingdom\u2019s Department for International Development agreed in January 2004 to include this \nstudy under the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund (PRF).2 Following an agreement that the \nstudy should examine different countries where road safety was a serious problem, four DMCs \nwere selected\u2014India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam. The Fact-Finding Mission was fielded \nin December 2004 to discuss the objectives of the regional technical assistance (TA), and to \nconfirm the scope of work, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  In the four DMCs, the key agencies concerned with road safety agreed that crashes \nwere increasing on their road networks. In many cases, the agencies considered crashes a \nsignificant threat to life and injury for the local population. Expanding motorization is increasing \nthe risk of accidents significantly, particularly since a high percentage of vehicle fleets comprise \ntwo-wheeled vehicles. In addition, each DMC has a large proportion of vulnerable road users, \nas nonmotorized vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians compete for road space with motorized \nvehicles. In many urban areas, markets and other economic and social activities also vie for \nroad space. In rural areas, roads are frequently used for purposes other than transportation. \nThe combination of these factors has increased the overall risk of road crashes significantly, \nand this situation is likely to continue unless steps are taken to mitigate the risks. However, \npolicy makers do not have adequate knowledge of the impact of road crashes to implement \nsuccessful countermeasures due to the absence of a proper assessment of the risks and \nidentification of the incidence of deaths and injuries. \n \n                                                 \n1  World Health Organization. 2004. World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention. Geneva. \n2  The technical assistance first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 9 February 2004. \n ", "2   \n4.  The impact of a road crash is felt most immediately at the household level. It often has \nan instantaneous impact on household activity, significantly affecting the quality of life. Death of \nthe main income earner, cost of medical treatment, and loss of a job and/or income resulting \nfrom a road crash often have important adverse economic and social consequences on a \nhousehold. For instance, studies in Bangladesh3 have demonstrated that road crashes often \npush  poor  households  into  poverty,  a  condition  from  which  they  have  trouble  recovering. \nGovernment agencies and WHO officials in the four DMCs agreed that the TA should focus on \nthe impact at the household level, particularly the impact on low-income and poverty households \nas they are the most vulnerable.  \n \n5.  The absence of a reliable accident data system is a serious constraint in many DMCs. \nGenerally, police statistics grossly underreport the seriousness of the road accident situation. As \na result, the issue is not accorded the national priority it deserves. Two of the countries, \nPakistan and Viet Nam, undertook injury surveys to identify the incidence of road traffic injuries \n(RTIs). In both countries, the surveys found that RTI is the main cause of noncommunicable \ndeaths and injuries, and primarily affects the main economically active group (males 20\u201345 \nyears old). In Pakistan, the injury survey concluded that police statistics underreport 18% of \nroad traffic fatalities and 75% of injuries. In Viet Nam, the injury survey estimated that the \nannual number of deaths is almost double the official figure at 21,000, while actual injuries are \n35 times the official figure at 1.1 million. The Planning Commission in India assumes that for \nevery road death, 15 people are seriously injured and 70 sustain slight injuries. Based on this \nformula, 1.2 million people are seriously injured and 5.6 million are slightly injured each year. In \nIndonesia, another TA4 estimated the number of fatalities at 3.5 times those of police records \nand injuries at almost 200 times police figures, affecting an estimated 2.5 million persons a year. \nOverall, deaths and injuries are significantly higher than official records indicate. This situation \nalso highlights the heavy and largely unseen burden on the health sector. Discussions with \nhealth  sector  officials  corroborate  the  pattern  of  increasing  deaths  and  injuries  from  road \ncrashes. The evidence suggests that emergency medical facilities in the four countries lack the \ncapacity  to  handle  the  rising  number  of  road  crash  victims  and  increasingly  they  impose \nsubstantial costs on already overburdened health systems. Identifying the burden on the health \nsector is important in establishing priorities, and formulating health sector budgets and policy on \nemergency services. It also raises the awareness of the debilitating impact of road crashes on \nsociety. \n \n6.  Vehicle insurance is often considered a way to provide a social safety net for those \ninvolved in a road crash. However, many vehicles in DMCs are not insured or are under-\ninsured. As a consequence, RTI victims frequently do not receive adequate compensation. \nGovernance issues are another common cause of insurance-related problems. In the four \nDMCs, legislation is in place requiring third party, no-fault insurance as a minimum. Still, a high \npercentage of vehicles are not insured. Premiums are also low. Even in cases where vehicles \nare properly insured, compensation payments are commensurately low and usually insufficient \nto cover medical treatment and other personal costs. In many instances, payments are made \nonly after lengthy judicial processes, and not when the funds are needed for medical and other \ncosts. In some countries, accident victims do not have any legal recourse. The assessment of \nthe socioeconomic impact of road crashes must include an evaluation of the effectiveness of the \n                                                 \n3 Transport Research Laboratory Limited. 2004.

The proposed TA has been designed to address these concerns. It will fill an important \ngap in the knowledge concerning the socioeconomic impact of road crashes and how they affect \nthe lives of poor individuals and households. The TA will help DMCs across the region take \nappropriate countermeasures to address road safety concerns particularly those that have direct \nimpact  on  the  poor.  The  findings  are  also  expected  to  enable  the  governments  adopt \nappropriate policies to mitigate the impact of road crashes and thereby improve the quality of life \nof the poor. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The ultimate objective of the TA is to reduce the number and severity of road crashes \nand particularly their impact on low-income households. At present, there is little knowledge in \nthe DMCs on the actual impact of road crashes and the information is deficient in determining \nwho are typically involved in road crashes and how crash events impact on the lives of people. \nThe TA is designed to close the knowledge gap by conducting household surveys designed to \nassess  the  socioeconomic  impact  on  individuals  and  households.  This  information  will  be \nsupported by information and data collected from public sector agencies, the private sector, and \ncivil society organizations involved with road safety. To assess differences across the region the \nTA will focus on four countries: India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam. The primary purpose \nof the TA is to improve DMCs\u2019 ability to plan and implement road safety measures that will save \nlives and reduce the severity of adverse impact particularly on low-income households. \n \n9.  The main outputs of the TA will include (i) four pro-poor road safety action plans; \n(ii) assessment of the socioeconomic impact of road crashes on households at different income \nlevels, with particular focus on poor and poverty households; (iii) an improved knowledge base \nof road crash statistics and a better understanding of linkages between road crashes and \npoverty;  (iv)  an  evaluation  of  the  burden  of  road  crashes  on  the  health  sector;  (v)  an \nassessment of motor vehicle insurance practices; and (vi) knowledge-sharing products and \nevents for dissemination of the TA findings across the region.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will document the impact of road crashes on households, their coping strategies, \nand the extent to which they are able to recover. The TA will estimate the cumulative cost to the \ncountry, as well as the extent of underreporting and the burden of RTI on health care facilities. \nRTI\u2019s contribution to poverty will also be examined as the poor are expected to be more at risk \nfor being involved in road crashes. Moreover, they have fewer resources to rely on in times of \nemergency. \n \n11.  The important activities of the TA are the following: \n \n(i)  Inventory health care facilities and rehabilitation services available for road traffic \nvictims in the study areas, and assess the burden road crashes place on the \nhealth sector by surveying the resources allocated to road traffic casualties in \nhospitals and health clinics. \n \n ", "4   \n(ii)  Survey  prospective  victim  households  to  document  the  financial  costs  and \nsocioeconomic impacts of having a household member killed or injured in a road \ncrash. The survey sample will cover metropolitan, urban, and rural households. It \nwill be large enough (expected survey size of 600\u20131,000 households) to identify \nstatistically  significant  differences  between  impacts  on  poor  and  non-poor \nhouseholds.  The  survey  will  also  include  a  full  range  of  socioeconomic \ncharacteristics, including gender, ethnicity, and age. Victim households are to be \nidentified at random from police records and facilities identified in the health care \nsurvey. Victim households will be given a diary to record costs and impact, and \nthe survey team will return periodically to interview households and collect data \nover a follow-up period of 1 year. \n \n(iii)  Review alternative sources of road casualty data (e.g., health care facilities, \nambulances, mortuaries, and newspapers), and estimate the incidence of actual \nroad traffic injury and extent of underreporting by casualty severity. \n \n(iv)  Collect  data  on  property  damage  costs  of  road  crashes,  and  evaluate  the \neffectiveness of the motor insurance system in providing a safety net for road \ncrash victims with particular emphasis on low-income and poverty households.  \n \n(v)  Identify  the  link  between  road  crashes  and  poverty,  including  the  risk  of \ninvolvement and the consequences to households. Transport policies should be \nreviewed to assess the priority that should be given to vulnerable road users and \nbus passengers, and to develop pro-poor national road safety action plans that \nrecommend how to reduce risks of road crashes and ameliorate the impact on \npoor households.   \n \n(vi)  Calculate the economic cost of road crashes to the nation, and identify who pays \nthe cost of road crashes. Produce a video showing personal experiences and \nstatistics from study findings. Present findings at a national workshop attended \nby  representatives  of  public  sector  agencies,  private  sector  companies,  civil \nsociety organizations, and academic institutions.  \n \n(vii)  Present and compare findings from the four countries at national and regional \nworkshops, national videos, and through a project website. The lessons learned \nwill be documented to assist with subsequent studies. The national workshops \nwill focus on a discussion of findings and conclusions, with the aim of agreeing \non the time frame and implementation arrangements for the road safety action \nplan. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The estimated cost of the TA is $1,005,000 equivalent, including foreign exchange cost \nof $537,000 and local currency cost of $468,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nPRF and administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The PRF will finance $925,000 \nequivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $388,000 equivalent of the local \ncurrency cost. The governments of India, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam will finance the \nremaining local currency costs of $80,000 by providing counterpart staff, office accommodation, \nand  other  in-kind  expenditures.  The  detailed  cost  estimates  and  financing  plan  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department;  Energy,  Transport,  and \nWater Division, will be the executing agency for the TA. A technical steering committee will be \ncreated within ADB to provide technical oversight. It will consist of transport staff from regional \ndepartments, as well as poverty specialists, social development specialists, economists, and \nhealth sector specialists. Within each DMC, a multisector project steering committee will be \nestablished  headed  by  a  focal  point.  The  focal  points  are  (i)  Ministry  of  Shipping,  Road \nTransport and Highways, Department of Road Transport and Highways in India; (ii) Ministry of \nCommunications,  Directorate  General  of  Land  Transport  in  Indonesia;  (iii)  Ministry  of \nCommunications,  National  Transport  Research  Centre  in  Pakistan;  and  (iv)  Ministry  of \nTransport, National Transport Safety Committee in Viet Nam. The national project steering \ncommittees will comprise a mix of public sector agencies involved with road safety, including \npolice, health, statistics, transport, and vehicle insurance industry, as well as nongovernment \norganizations, private firms, and academic institutions. In addition, the WHO office in each \ncountry has agreed to participate actively in the study. \n \n14.  The TA will require 72 person-months of consulting services, comprising 20 person-\nmonths of international consultants and 52 person-months of domestic consultants from the \nparticipating countries. The consultants will be firms of international consultants in association \nwith domestic consultants. They will be engaged using ADB\u2019s quality and cost-based selection \nprocedures and in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants based on the \nsubmission of simplified technical proposals. The website specialist will be hired as an individual \nconsultant. The international specialists will include a social survey specialist as team leader, \nroad safety specialist, poverty specialist, statistician, and motor vehicle insurance specialist. The \ndomestic consultant teams will include a similar range of specialists. Field survey teams will also \nbe required in each country to collect the required household survey data and supporting \ninformation. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, beginning in February 2006 and ending by \nFebruary 2008. For the overall study, the consultants will submit an inception report 4 weeks \nafter commencement, followed by brief monthly progress reports. Separate inception reports \nand quarterly progress reports will be submitted for each of the country studies. Final reports for \neach of the country studies, and an overall summary report, will be submitted by the end of the \nservices in hard and soft copies. To disseminate the results of the studies, national workshops \nwill be conducted in each country. In addition, a regional workshop will be held to ensure broad \ndissemination  to  countries  across  the  region.  A  website  will  also  be  created  to  provide \ninformation on the study and its progress. To promote the findings of the TA, a video will be \nprepared summarizing the socioeconomic impacts and conclusions.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n16.
