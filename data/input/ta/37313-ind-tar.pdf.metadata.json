The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has included in its Country Strategy Programming \nUpdate (CSPU) 2005\u201320071 a loan for the North Eastern Region Urban Development (Phase I) \nProject (NERUDP Phase I)2 in 2006, and a loan for the North Eastern Region Urban Development \n(Phase II) Project (NERUDP Phase II)3 in 2008. During the Fact-Finding Mission for the project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for NERUDP Phase I4 in February 2004, the Government \nof India requested ADB to provide technical assistance (TA) for implementing the Project and \nimproving urban management for the cities covered under NERUDP Phase I,5 at completion of the \nPPTA for NERUDP Phase I. The Fact-Finding Mission during 28 March to 8 April 2005 held \ndiscussions with the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region (MODNER) and reached an \nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  objectives  and  scope  of  the  TA,  including  the \nconsultants\u2019 terms of reference (TOR) and the implementation arrangements.6 The TA framework \nis in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The north eastern region (NER) of India, which includes the states of Arunachal Pradesh, \nAssam,  Manipur,  Meghalaya,  Mizoram,  Nagaland,  Sikkim,  and  Tripura,  is  one  of  the  least-\ndeveloped regions in India. While it accounts for 8% of India\u2019s landmass, it has a population of 39 \nmillion\u2014less than 4.4% of India\u2019s total population\u2014of which 15% or 5.9 million live in 239 urban \ncenters. The urban population in the NER varies among the states, ranging from 11.1% in Sikkim \nto 49.5% in Mizoram.7 The NER has recorded some improvements in social indicators over the last \ndecade. For instance, the average literacy rates for the NER states are higher in general than the \nnational average of 65%, with the exception of Assam which has a literacy rate of 64%. Similarly, \ninfant mortality in the NER in general is lower than the national average (68 per 1,000 live births), \nagain with the exception of Assam where infant mortality (71 per 1,000 live births) is higher than \nthe national average. However, average life expectancy at birth (56 years) for the NER is lower \nthan  the  national  average  of  61.8  In  general,  the  cumulative  effect  of  physiography,  poor \nconnectivity, dispersed settlement pattern, low investments, as well as years of ethnic unrest has \nresulted in significant urban poverty and minimal basic infrastructure facilities and services in the \nNER as indicated by 32% of its population still living below the poverty line.9  \n \n3.  Though passage of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act has provided a significant \nmomentum  to urban sector reforms in India, progress toward implementation of reforms and \ndevolution in the NER under the Act has been constrained by the limited capacity of the states to \nform urban policies and decentralize power and operations to the urban local bodies (ULBs). The \nULBs in general are weak. Of the eight capital cities in the NER, only two, Agartala and Guwahati, \nhave fully functioning ULBs. While Imphal, Kohima, and Shillong have partially functioning ULBs, \nAizawal and Gangtok lack local bodies completely. Furthermore, significantly large indigenous \ntribal populations in these cities have given rise to different institutional arrangements and legal \nsystems. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution of India, enacted in 1950, contains provisions for \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004.

Technical Assistance to India for the North Eastern Region Urban Development Project. Manila. \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 18 October 2005. \n6  The advisory TA, which consisted of two separate ADTAs (capacity building for project management in five cities of the \nNE region, and sustainable urban management support program in the NER, respectively) at the time of TA fact-\nfinding stage, was subsequently combined upon consultation with the Government of India. \n7  The average population density of the NER (149 people per square kilometer) varies from 13 in Arunachal Pradesh to \n340 in Assam, compared with the national average of 324. \n8  The data on life expectancy at birth (56 years) in Assam is the only available data in the NER states. \n9  ADB. 2003. North Eastern Region Urban Sector Profile Project: Final Report. Manila. ", "2   \nadministration of tribal areas and is applicable to Shillong, and allows a parallel tribal governance \nframework to exist. \n \n4.  The line departments of state governments perform a major role in delivering basic services \nlike water supply and sanitation, construction and maintenance of roads, and management of \npublic amenities in all the NER states. These are mainly the Urban Development Department, \nPublic Health and Engineering Department, and Public Works Department of concerned states. \nDevolution of power and responsibilities under the 74th Amendment Act, as earlier mentioned, and \ncreation of a decentralized governance structure at the ULB level with responsibilities for service \nprovision and resource mobilization being assumed and managed, is yet to materialize in the NER \nregion. So far, little difference to either the functioning of ULBs or their finances has happened. The \nULBs heavily depend on state governments for leadership as well as funding since revenue \ncollection in the states is very low. For example, property taxes do not even exist in Kohima, and \nwater rates are so low as to be insignificant in all cities except Kohima. Both the states and the \nULBs depend heavily on grants from the central Government for their sustenance. \n \n5.  Despite the development challenges, external agencies\u2019 involvement has been very limited \nin the NER, including in the urban sector. At present, only two bilateral agencies are active: the \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID)  in  Shillong  and  Gangtok,  and  the \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de Developpement in Imphal. Only Assam among the ULBs in the region has \nexperience  with  ADB\u2019s  project  administration  procedures.  Most  of  the  concerned  government \nagencies in the NER prepare detailed designs only for a few major projects, and most supervise \nconstruction with their own staff. Many rely on government-owned construction companies, such as \nthe  National  Building  Construction  Corporation,  to  construct  turnkey  projects  on  their  behalf. \nFurthermore,  there  is  a  shortage  of  professionally  qualified  technical  staff  in  critical  areas of \nmunicipal management in the region. \n \n6.  Lessons from implementation of ADB-funded urban projects in India10 show a common \nissue of start-up delays and slow disbursements in the initial years, largely on account of delays in \nrecruiting consultants and completing preparatory work before contract awards. The review found \nthat up-front capacity building is essential to achieve the physical and institutional targets of urban \nprojects. While the standard practice in ADB is to provide capacity-building assistance with the \napproval  of  a  loan  project,  the  lessons  learned  clearly  indicate  the  need  to  strengthen  the \nmanagement  and  institutional  capacities  of  the  state  and  ULBs  prior  to  loan  effectiveness, \nparticularly in  the  states  that  are  new  to  ADB-sponsored  urban  projects.  Furthermore,  timely \nintroduction  of  financial  and  governance  reform  measures  and  timely  initiation  of  associated \ninstitutional reforms are crucial in ensuring success and sustenance of the project.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The objective of the TA is to strengthen project management and institutional capabilities, \nand improve overall readiness for project implementation of the states and ULBs expected to be \nresponsible for NERUDP Phase I. The TA will assist the project states and ULBs, which include \nAgartala, Aizwal, Gangtok, Kohima, and Shillong, to efficiently and effectively manage, coordinate, \nimplement, and monitor the Project, including the institutional and financial reform initiatives under \nthe Project. The key outcomes of the TA will be (i) identification of key project personnel and \ncreation of project management and project implementation units; (ii) training for the executing and \nimplementing agencies to familiarize them with ADB policies and procedures; (iii) completion of \nconsultants\u2019  selection  and  prequalification  of  contractors;  (iv)  completion  of  complete  sets  of \nstandard bidding documents for civil works and equipment supplies; (v) identification of required \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2003. Urban Sector Review and Strategy. Manila. ", "      3\nland and acquisition notification with disclosure to affected people issued by the implementation \nagencies and prepared resettlement guidelines; and (vi) introduction of institutional and financial \nreforms. The TA will also support the project states and ULBs to take forward activities initiated \nunder the AusAid program in Gangtok and Shillong The TA will also assist the project states and \nULBs in conducting public awareness and stakeholder consultations to improve understanding and \nacceptance of the Project and build consensus for introducing institutional reforms recommended \nby the PPTA, whose completion is expected in March 2006. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  The TA will include the project states and ULBs covered under NERUDP Phase I. As each \nof the project states and ULBs has its own historical background, institutional arrangements, \nfinancial situation and project implementation experience, the needs and readiness for capacity \nbuilding will differ among them. Some ULBs, such as Agartala, are well-organized, and in many \nrespects more ready for the Project, while others that lack elected councils are less so. To support \nup-front capacity building, each project state has been requested to identify a nodal department for \nthe Project, and to identify the department responsible for each of the three components of the \nProject. Key activities under each TA component include the following: \n \n1.  Component A: Project Implementation Support \nand Establishment of Managerial Structure  \n \n9.  The TA will refine the managerial and personnel structures for the project states and ULBs \nthat were developed in the PPTA, and will prepare detailed TOR for the key personnel. The TA will \nassist the project states and ULBs to define their clear role in undertaking activities under the \nProject. In doing so, the TA will prepare an operational manual defining the role of each entity in \nimplementing the Project and delegating suitable powers. Furthermore, the TA will strengthen the \nsupervisory capacity of MODNER, the project states, and ULBs in monitoring activities related to \nproject implementation. \n \n10.  The TA will implement the project management systems and procedures proposed by the \nPPTA. They include, among others, overall project management, contract management, project \nperformance  monitoring  and  evaluation,  procurement,  recruitment  of  consultants,  project \naccounting, construction supervision, fund management, and reporting. The TA will assist the \nproject  states  and  ULBs  in  preparing  for  project  start-up  activities,  including,  among  others, \npreparing  of  short-range  action  plans,  recruiting  and  training  staff,  establishing  a  steering \ncommittee and a central-level project management unit (PMU) within MODNER and state-level \nPMUs and project implementation units (PIUs) in the project states, satisfying the conditions for \nloan effectiveness, shortlisting, and recruiting of project consultants, preparing budgets and early \ndisbursement requests, preparing standard procurement documents and contracts, and firming up \narrangements for land acquisition and resettlement.  \n \n11.  The  TA  will  assist  the  project  states  and  ULBs  in  learning  about  ADB\u2019s  policies  and \nprocedures  for  procurement,  recruitment  of  consultants,  disbursement,  fund  management, \nenvironmental and social safety guards, corruption prevention, auditing, reporting, and other key \naspects of project operations. Furthermore, the TA will help train the project states\u2019 and ULBs\u2019 \npersonnel in planning, leading, organizing, and coordinating project activities through participatory \nworkshops and on-the-job involvement in project management. These activities will be carried out \nafter an assessment of the training needs of project states and ULBs. \n ", "4   \n2.  Component B: Institutional and Financial Reforms \n \n12.  The  TA  consultants  will  assist  the  project  states  and  ULBs  in  carrying  out  urban \nmanagement,  institutional,  and  financial  reforms  recommended  by  the  PPTA.  They  include \nestablishment of ULBs; strengthening of existing ULBs with severe deficiencies; initiation of water \nutilities arrangement in all project ULBs; improvement of urban planning in all project ULBs; and \nimprovement of property taxation and user charges for such services as water supply, sewerage, \nand  solid  waste  management  in  all  project  ULBs.  The  following  specific  activities  will  be \nundertaken in the project ULBs: \n \n(i)  Introduce double-entry accounting system. \n(ii)  Verify and evaluate water supply and sanitation assets.  \n(iii)  Prepare and digitize the customer database (for water supply services). \n(iv)  Install bulk and household water meters to conduct a study on existing levels of \nnonrevenue water.  \n(v)  Assess human resource capacities and deficiencies in the water services sector, \nand formulate options for the current employees in the sector. \n(vi)  Assess and register property (for tax purposes) and develop a database supported \nby a management information system/geographical information system to increase \nproperty tax and tariff revenues. \n \n13.  Two representatives each from the project states and ULBs will participate in a weeklong \nstudy tour of Karnataka State (Bangalore and another identified city/town in Karnataka) where the \nabovementioned reforms, developed by the e-Governments Foundation in Karnataka, are being \nsuccessfully  implemented.  The  objective  is  for  the  representatives  to  directly  observe  the \nimplementation  of  such  reforms  in  the  two  cities  and  to  learn  from  the  cities\u2019  experience  in \nintroducing those reforms. \n \n3.  Component C: Public Relations and Stakeholder Consultation \n \n14.  The TA will assist the project states and ULBs in organizing and carrying out stakeholder \nconsultation and awareness campaigns to (i) improve public understanding and acceptance of the \nProject,  and  (ii)  seek  feedback  and  build  consensus  for  introducing  the  institutional  reforms \nrecommended by the PPTA. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,900,000 equivalent, comprising foreign exchange \nof $434,000 and local currency equivalent of $1,466,000. The amount of $1,400,000 comprising \n$414,000 foreign exchange cost and $986,000 local currency equivalent will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the ADB's TA funding program, an amount of $120,000 comprising $20,000 foreign \nexchange  cost  and  $100,000  local  currency  cost  will  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the \nCooperation Fund for the Water Sector, both will be administered by ADB. The Government and \nthe  project  states  will  contribute  the  remaining  local  currency  equivalent  of  $380,000  for \ncounterpart  staff  support,  office  accommodation,  field  transport,  facilities  for  meetings  and \nworkshops, and other administrative expenses. The Government, the project states, and ULBs will \nalso provide all available information required for the TA activities. Detailed cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  MODNER will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and will be responsible for overall \ncoordination with ADB. A central-level steering committee and PMU will be established within \nMODNER, and a state-level steering committee and PMU/PIU will be established in each project \nstate. MODNER and the project states will provide full administrative and technical support to the ", "      5\nconsultants and will coordinate activities with the project states and ULBs. MODNER and the \nproject  states  will  also  provide  the  consultants  with  adequate  office  space  and  sufficient \ncommunication means. The TA will be implemented over 14 months, tentatively from May 2006 to \nJune 2007. Since adequate capacities exist in India for the required services to be provided by \nconsultants, domestic consulting firms will be engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants, following ADB\u2019s quality- and cost-based selection method. The TA will include two \nconsulting packages: package 1 will cover components A and C as outlined in para. 15 above, and \npackage 2 will cover component B. Consulting firms will be allowed to bid for both packages. \nConsulting services will total 53 person-months in package 1, and 49 person-months in package 2. \nSince  institutional  reforms  in  the  water  sector,  in  particular  initiation  of  water  utilities  and \ninvolvement  of  private  sector  participation,  are  still  new  concepts  in  India,  two  international \nconsultants will be recruited separately for a total of 9 person-months, on an individual basis, to \nassist mainly in implementing of activities in component B.  \n \n17.  In package 1, the key consultants (53 person-months) are a team leader with expertise in \nproject management (14), a procurement specialist (12), sector specialists\u2013\u2013urban transportation, \nwater supply, wastewater, drainage, and solid waste management (8), a land and resettlement \nspecialist  (2),  environment  specialist  (2),  a  financial  management  specialist  (3),  a  project \naccounting  specialist  (4),  a  community  consultation  and  public  relations  specialist  (3),  and  a \ntraining specialist (5). To give technical support to the consultants, technical and administrative \nassistants will be engaged as required. In package 2, the key consultants (49 person-months) are \na team leader with expertise in public administration (12), a water supply specialist (6), financial \nmanagement and accounting specialists (16), a human resource development specialist (6), a \nproperty taxation specialist (7), and a legal specialist (2).  Surveyors, information technology \nsupport personnel, and other technical support will be provided to the consultants through the \nengagement of staff as required. The international consultants, to be recruited individually, are an \nurban management specialist (3 person-months) and a water utilities specialist (6 person-months). \nThe outline TOR for the consultants are in Appendix 3. A summary initial poverty and social \nanalysis report is in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  The consultants for each of the two packages under the TA will submit (i) an inception \nreport within 4 weeks of TA commencement, (ii) monthly progress reports at the end of each month \nduring the TA implementation period, (iii) an interim report after 7 months, and (iv) a final report \nupon completion of the TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n19.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB providing a portion of technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,400,000 to the Government of India for Project \nImplementation and Urban Management Improvement in the North Eastern Region (Phase I), to be \nfinanced on a grant basis. If the Board approves ADB providing the technical assistance, the \nPresident, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, will approve ADB administering the \nbalance  of  the  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $120,000,  for  Project \nImplementation and Urban Management Improvement in the North Eastern Region (Phase I) to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n       \nDesign Summary  Performance  Data Sources/   Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   \nImpact      Assumption \nStrengthened managerial  NERUDP Phase I Project to  TA consultants\u2019 final report  Government  and  ADB \nand institutional  achieve  its  development    sign TA agreement. \ncapabilities of the five  objectives  during     \nstate governments and  implementation,  and  to  Risk \nULBs under the NERUDP  maintain  a  highly  The enforcement of the \nPhase I Project, and  satisfactory  rating  in  the  National Urban Renewal \nsuccessful  project performance report  Mission initiative, \nimplementation of    including provisions of \nNERUDP Phase I Project  Institutional  and  financial  the 74th Amendment to \n  reforms  successfully  the Constitution in \n  implemented  in  NERUDP  strengthening the \nphase I cities  functions and \n  responsibilities of ULBs, \n  is weak. \n \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved efficiency and  Major implementation  TA consultants\u2019 monthly  The Government, local \neffectiveness in  actions, such as contract  progress reports  governments, and all \nmanaging, implementing,  signing with consultants and    other stakeholders \ncoordinating, and  major procurement  remain committed. \nmonitoring the  package, ready as soon as   \nimplementation of urban  the NERUDP phase I loan  Risk \ninfrastructure and  becomes effective, and  Appointment of qualified \ninstitutional development  institutional changes set in  staff to the PCO, PMUs, \nreforms under the  motion for the NERUDP  and PIUs for the \nNERUDP Phase I Project,  Phase I Project  NERUDP Phase I project \nand initiated loan start-up    is delayed. \nactivities under NERUDP   \nPhase I Project \nOutputs      Assumption \n1.
