The Asian Development Bank (ADB) had included in its country operations business \nplan for 2008\u20132010 a loan for the Bihar Urban Development Project.1 Key aspects of the \nproposed  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (PPTA)  and  the  proposed  project  were \ndiscussed  with  Bihar  officials  and  other  stakeholders  during  the  Fact-Finding  Mission  in \nMarch 2008, which coincided with the review of the ongoing component technical assistance \n(CTA) for the Bihar Urban Sector Project (under the technical assistance cluster for project \nprocessing and capacity development).2 A consensus was reached in principle on the purpose, \nscope, implementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of reference for \nthe PPTA. The PPTA3 framework is in Appendix 1. The concept was reviewed and approved by \nADB\u2019s Management on 24 April 2008.  \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  India has urbanized rapidly in the last few decades as its economy has grown. Its urban \npopulation is now the second largest in the world, after that of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nThree of the world\u2019s 10 largest cities are in India, where about 11% of urban growth worldwide is \noccurring.  The  contribution  of  urban  areas  to  the  Indian  economy  has  also  increased \ndramatically, and now accounts for 60% of gross domestic product\u2014urban India is the country\u2019s \nengine of growth. However, despite their economic prominence, the urban areas are faced with \nserious deterioration in the physical environment and poor services. Explosive urban growth \nwithout adequate capital investments has resulted in severe deficiencies in infrastructure. Weak \ncapacity among the service providers, coupled with a slow-developing municipal management \nsystem, contributes to poor urban service delivery.         \n3.  The Government of India has recently strived to give importance to the urban sector and \nimprove urban infrastructure and services through institutional and financial interventions. The \n74th Constitution Amendment Act laid the foundation for a new approach to urban management \nand  governance  by  handing  the  responsibilities  over  to  the  local  governments.  The  10th \nFive-Year  Plan  (FY2002\u2013FY2006)  and  11th Five  Year  Plan  (FY2007\u2013FY2011),  with  their \nemphasis on investments in social infrastructure, added momentum to the urban sector reforms. \nHowever, such government efforts have not been able to meet the demand for urban services, \nwhich far outstrips supply and municipal capacity. As a result, urban households, particularly the \npoor and disenfranchised, still have limited access to urban services such as water, sanitation, \nand solid waste management. \n4.  With a population of about 83 million, 8.1% of India\u2019s population, the state of Bihar is the \nthird most populous state in India. Its gross population density, at 881 persons per square \nkilometer, is one of the highest in the country. But the state, predominantly agriculture-based, \n                                                 \n1  Previously called the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Sector Program. The change in title reflects the \nchange in mode of financing, from multitranche financing facility to project loan in consultation with the Executing \nAgency and the Department of Economic Affairs of the Government of India. \n2  Approved in June 2007 by the director general of the South Asia Department and begun in September 2007, the \n$450,000  Bihar  CTA  is  ADB\u2019s  response  to  the  Bihar  government\u2019s  request  for  support  for  its  policy  of \nsocioeconomic development for the state. The CTA also supports the ongoing application of the Patna city \ncorporation for grant funds from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and the preparation of an \nurban sector road map for two main cities in the state, Patna and Gaya. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 16 May 2008. ", " 2     \nhas been mired in very slow economic growth4 over the last few decades and is India\u2019s least \nurbanized. According to the 2001 census, Bihar had an urban population of only 8.68 million, or \n10.46% of the total population, versus the national average of 28%. About 60% of this urban \npopulation is in the southern part of the state, with a significant concentration in Patna, and \nmore than 50% is in class I towns (towns with a population of more than 100,000; Bihar had 19 \nof these in the 2001 census), thus putting concentrated pressure on those towns.  \n5.  Infrastructure and urban services in the state\u2019s urban local bodies (ULBs) are generally \npoor and inadequate. In the water sector, the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED) \nand Bihar Rajya Jal Parshad (BRJP) create water and sewerage infrastructure assets, which \nare operated and maintained by the ULBs. Groundwater is a major source of water in the state. \nThe water sector is beset with a host of problems. Piped water supply is low\u2014about 40% of the \npopulation of Patna and Gaya, Bihar\u2019s two largest ULBs, rely on private tube wells or public \nstand posts\u2014and the extension of the distribution networks lags behind the growth in the urban \npopulation. Large quantities of water are lost to leaks: unaccounted-for water is estimated at \nmore than 40%. There is no accurate database of distribution systems and condition of pipes in \nany of the ULBs, making system operation and maintenance much more difficult. \n6.  Of all the ULBs in Bihar, only Patna has a sewerage system covering 18% of the town \narea. In the other ULBs and the unsewered part of Patna, most houses have septic tanks, from \nwhich effluent flows into soak pits or roadside municipal drains. Open defecation is common and \ncauses risks to public health and the environment. The wastewater is intercepted at the outfall \nof drains or sumps of pumping stations, but about 30% of the pumps are not working. The \nsewage treatment plants in Patna, which were built in the late 1980s, are now running at only \nabout 65% of their designed capacity and are in urgent need of repair and upgrading. \n7.  Although municipal solid waste management is a mandatory function of the ULBs, a \nsignificant volume of the waste produced in the state is left unattended. Only 55% of the 680 \ntons of solid waste generated daily in Patna and only 60% of the 200 tons in Gaya is collected. \nAnd even this is dumped openly into low-lying areas or along the main corridors. None of the \nULBs in the state have a proper disposal facility or sanitary landfill.  \n8.  The state has yet to prepare a statement of its urban policy or strategy. Without such a \nunified policy document, urban sector works have been fragmentary and have been undertaken \nby different agencies without close alignment of resources, resulting in grossly inadequate and \ninefficient urban development. Despite the breakthrough Bihar Municipal Act introduced by the \nstate in 2007, fully empowering the ULBs to provide all urban services and recover costs, \nnonmunicipal agencies (PHED and BRJP) retain control of typical municipal functions such as \nthe creation of water supply and sewerage systems. Besides, the ULBs have very low technical, \nfinancial, and institutional and management capacity and need extensive strengthening, along \nwith immediate financial reforms, to fulfill their mandate under the Municipal Act.   \n9.  In this context, a study was made of the state\u2019s urban sector and a sector road map for \nPatna  and  Gaya  was  prepared  under  the  Bihar  CTA.  The  study  assessed  the  urban \ninfrastructure and urban service conditions, consumer patterns, and institutional capacity of \nservice  providers,  and  identified  the  priority  areas  requiring  policy,  technical,  and  financial \nintervention. The draft final report, submitted recently, outlined the basic urban infrastructure \nrequirements of Bihar\u2019s two largest cities, which are development priorities for the next 7\u201315 \nyears. The study also found substantial need for developing the institutional capacity of the state \nand its ULBs to heighten the beneficial effects of infrastructure development as well as the \nefficiency and effectiveness of urban planning, development, and management. The findings led \n                                                 \n4  The state\u2019s per capita gross state domestic product in 2004 was Rs9,600, lowest among all states of India. The \naverage per capita gross domestic product in India that year was Rs31,605. ", "                                  3\nto an agreement to phase ADB\u2019s investment in the urban sector of Bihar to ensure that the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies  have  the  capacity  to  implement  and  replicate  the \ninvestment project. The PPTA will verify the findings of the Bihar CTA and finalize the detailed \nscope for the first externally funded urban project in the state, covering limited subsectors such \nas water supply and sewerage in Patna and Gaya. \n10.  Previous  ADB  urban  sector  projects  in  India  started  up  only  after  significant  delay \nbecause of insufficient groundwork for the establishment of the project management structure \nand  subsequent  delay  in  the  field  works.  In  light  of  the  strong  emphasis  placed  by  the \nGovernment of India on project readiness, the PPTA will facilitate Bihar\u2019s project preparatory \nactivities to maximize its project readiness and ensure the success of this first focused external \nurban sector intervention in the state as a showcase for future projects. \n11.  The prospective executing and implementing agencies have very little experience in \nprocessing or implementing projects funded by external development agencies. The long-term \nsustainability of assets and service delivery requires extensive development of state as well as \nlocal capacity. The PPTA and the ensuing project, after a careful assessment of the capacity of \neach institution against its role and responsibilities in urban services delivery, will assist the \nagencies  in  building  their  technical  and  planning  capacity,  and  support  institutional \nstrengthening, financial reform, and the establishment of a geographic information system and \nmanagement information system. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The proposed project will improve living conditions and the urban environment in the \nselected city corporations in the state of Bihar. The desired outcome of the PPTA will be a \nfeasible investment project in the urban sector of the state, to be financed with a loan from ADB, \nand shortened preparatory time for project implementation. \n13.  The outputs of the PPTA will be as follows:  \n(i)  A feasible urban infrastructure development project to be financed by ADB; \n(ii)  Better preparedness for project implementation; \n(ii)  Capacity-building packages to make project management and implementation \nmore timely and effective; and  \n(iv)  An identified public-private partnership (PPP) component with an assessment of \nits feasibility.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The PPTA will support (i) a study on a feasible investment package for ADB financing, \n(ii) improvements in project management and implementation capacity in the executing and \nimplementing  agencies,  and  other  preparatory  activities  to  enhance  readiness  for  loan \nimplementation, and (iii) a study on the feasibility of PPP in urban service delivery in Bihar.  \n15.  The PPTA will produce an assessment of the technical, economic, financial, social, and \nenvironmental  feasibility  of  the  identified  investment  project  for  ADB  financing,  taking  into \naccount the Bihar CTA findings and the sector road map for the state. It will also evaluate the \nfinancial capacity of the executing agency according to ADB guidelines. All documents required \nby ADB for loan processing will be prepared. To ensure the long-term financial sustainability of ", " 4     \nthe assets created by the investment project, an appropriate customer tariff structure and a \ntarget tax collection rate will be assessed and designed.  \n16.  The PPTA will also assist the government of Bihar in (i) setting up project management \nand implementation units (PMU and PIUs) in the executing and implementing agencies and \nother coordination committees as required; (ii) preparing project implementation documents, \nsuch as contract packages, a procurement plan, and various standard bid documents, and \ncarrying  out  advance  action  for  project  consultant  and  contractor  selection,  surveys, \ninvestigations, and baseline data preparation, to increase project readiness and jump-start the \nimplementation when the ensuing loan takes effect; and (iii) assessing the capacity of urban \nservice providers and starting some capacity enhancement activities, including the training of \nPMU and PIU staff in ADB procedures and policies.5  \n17.  With respect to the development of PPP options for the project city corporations, the \nalternatives for urban service outsourcing and strengthening through PPP will be analyzed \nwherever  possible.  The  PPTA  will  further  support  the  structuring,  packaging,  and \nimplementation of the most feasible PPP option in the state\u2019s urban services, in parallel with its \nsupport  for  the  capacity  development  and  institutional  strengthening  of  the  government \nagencies.     \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the PPTA is estimated at $1,250,000. At the request of the government \nof Bihar, ADB will finance $1,000,000 of this amount with a grant from the Japan Special Fund, \nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Bihar government will finance the remaining $250,000 \nby  providing  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  and  transport  and  covering  other \nmiscellaneous expenditures. The government has been informed that approval of the TA does \nnot commit ADB to finance any ensuing loan project. Details of the cost estimates and the \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Urban Development Department (UDD) of Bihar will be the Executing Agency for \nthe PPTA. The PMU, once established, will be the Implementing Agency and the core agent in \nimplementing the activities envisaged under the PPTA. The PMU will be based in Patna and will \nbe headed by a project director. A high-level interdepartmental project advisory committee \nunder the state\u2019s development commissioner will be established to guide the project preparation \nand coordinate the stakeholders involved in urban services. Similarly, city committees will also \nbe established to coordinate the PPTA activities.  \n20.  The PPTA will be implemented over 24 months, from September 2008 to August 2010. \nIndividual international (8 person-months) and national (69) consultants will be hired according \nto ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). For \ncontinuity with the works that have been performed well under the Bihar CTA, a number of \nindividual consultants from the CTA will continue to conduct the works under the PPTA. A water \nsector  specialist  (5  person-months)  and  a  PPP  transaction  expert  (3)  will  be  hired  as \ninternational  consultants.  The  national  individual  consultants  will  be  as  follows:  a  project \nmanagement specialist and team leader (13 person-months), an institutional specialist (5), a \nwater supply specialist (6), a sewerage specialist (6), a procurement specialist (5), a financial \nmanagement and accounting specialist (4), a project economist (3), municipal engineers (8), a \n                                                 \n5  Including ADB\u2019s safeguards policies. ", "                                  5\nwastewater process specialist (2), an environmental specialist (2), a social and community \ndevelopment  specialist  (4),  an  electrical  and  instrumentation  specialist  (2),  a  mechanical \nengineer (2), a structural engineer (1), and a PPP specialist (6). Personnel support for the \nsurveys, data collection, and information technology and other technical support will be provided \nto the consultants as required. The team leader will coordinate the activities and inputs to the \nrequired reports and deliverables, and conduct the surveys and data collection. Outline terms of \nreference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. Equipment6 will be procured by the consultants \naccording to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Appendix 4 \ncontains the summary initial poverty and social analysis report.  \n21.  To facilitate implementation, the PPTA will use an advance payment facility for training, \nseminars,  workshops,  other  capacity  development  programs,  surveys,  equipment,  and \nmiscellaneous administration and support costs. The advance payment facility, to be agreed on \nbetween ADB and the UDD, will detail the procedures and implementation arrangements for its \nuse, and its liquidation and replenishment requirements, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2008, as amended from time to time). \n22.  The PPTA consultants will submit the following reports: (i) an inception report with a \ndetailed work plan, within the first month; (ii) an interim report with detailed studies of the \nsubprojects and the feasibility reports, by the end of the seventh month; (iii) a draft final report, \nby the end of the 13th month; and (iv) a final report, by the end of the 17th month.  \nIV.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how the project \nwould directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the partner \ncountry. \n \nThe approach paper of the 11th Five-Year Plan shows the Government\u2019s continued focus on infrastructure investment, social \ndevelopment, and agriculture and rural development to make growth more inclusive.a The goal of the proposed project is to \nimprove the living conditions and urban environment by providing sustainable urban infrastructure services. This goal is \nconsistent with the core focus of ADB\u2019s assistance strategy, which involves supporting infrastructure development. Support \nfor Bihar, one of the poor states of India, will also augur well for efforts to reduce interstate disparities, as emphasized in the \napproach paper.  \n \nB.    Targeting Classification          \n1.

The proposed project is classified as TI-M7. \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA. Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? Primary beneficiaries will be the users of urban services in project-selected areas in Bihar. The proposed project will \nbe designed to ensure that the supported urban services are affordable to the poor. It will also assess the potential for \nupgrading services in low-income areas and slums. \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? An ADB study shows significant \ndeficiencies in urban water supply, sewerage and sanitation, solid waste management, drainage, and transport infrastructure. \nImprovements in urban infrastructure services, including an increase in coverage and quality, are needed to improve the \nliving conditions of the potential beneficiaries and the urban environment. \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address them? \nThe main constraint will be affordability. Once the urban infrastructure is improved, beneficiaries should be able to afford the \nimproved services. The PPTA will include an affordability analysis. \n \n \n \n ", "16      Appendix 4      \nB. Consultation and Participation \n1. Indicate the potential initial stakeholders.
