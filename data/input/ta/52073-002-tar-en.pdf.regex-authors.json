The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide three Pacific \ndeveloping  member  countries  (DMCs)\u2015Nauru,  Solomon Islands,  and  Vanuatu\u2015with  policy \nadvice and program preparation and implementation support to a series of ensuing programs \nfocused on improving public financial management (PFM) practices. The ensuing programs \ncomprise: Improving Public Investment Management Program 2 (Nauru); Increased Domestic \nResource  Mobilization  Program  (Solomon  Islands);  and  the  Sustaining  Economic  Growth \nProgram (Phases 1 and 2) (Vanuatu).1 In addition, the TA will support research on PFM issues in \nthese countries which will help inform future Asian Development Bank (ADB) programs. \n \n2.  The TA will support Strategy 2030\u2019s key operational priority of strengthening governance \nand institutional capacity.2 The TA also reflects Strategy 2030\u2019s differentiated approach to fragile \nand conflict-affected situations and small island developing states. Strategy 2030 requires ADB\u2019s \nsupport  in fragile  and conflict-affected  situations  to  focus  on  institutional  development  and \ngovernance reforms. Similarly, for small island developing states, Strategy 2030 emphasizes \ninstitutional strengthening to support countries\u2019 efforts to manage financial and economic risk; and \nreform state-owned enterprises.  \n \n3.  The TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Pacific Approach 2016\u20132020 and its strategy of reducing \ncosts, managing risks, and enabling value creation.3 Specifically, the TA will manage risks by \nstrengthening institutional capacities and promoting sound public sector management. This will \nlead  to  fiscal  buffers  being  built  through  a  range  of  revenue  measures,  budget  process \nimprovements, expenditure controls, and efficiency gains in public administration. \n \n4.  PFM systems in the Pacific context are often very different from the sophisticated and \ncomprehensive systems in developed countries. Governments typically have to make trade-offs \nbetween what can be done versus international standards. Governments are also constrained \nwith small numbers of staff and high staff turnover which limits capacity building efforts. This \nmeans governments, even with the support of development partners, find it difficult to plan PFM \nreforms, prioritize PFM reform actions, and access additional capacity to implement and sustain \nPFM reforms.4 This is the situation in the three DMCs to be supported under this TA. \n \n5.  Nauru has an underdeveloped PFM system, though with development partner support, it \nhas made credible improvements. In 2011, Nauru introduced a financial management information \nsystem (FMIS) capable of basic budget control, management accounting, and reporting. In 2016, \nNauru completed a public expenditure and financial accountability self-assessment which showed \ngood progress in FMIS implementation; budget preparation, credibility and reliability; and revenue \nadministration and accounting. In the same year, Nauru established an intergenerational trust \nfund to improve its fiscal sustainability.  However, several weaknesses were also identified \nincluding an absence of fiscal strategy and multi-year budgeting; weak debt management; weak \nmonitoring of public corporations which undermines government reporting on its financial assets; \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018.

Planning Public Financial Management Reforms in Pacific Island Countries: Guidance Note. \nWashington, DC. https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/16507 \n \n ", "2   \nand lack of legislative scrutiny by Parliament.5 Nauru\u2019s state-owned enterprises (SOE) are \ngenerally poorly governed and managed, and subject to political interference which leads to weak \nfinancial results and service delivery.6 Many SOEs are directly managed by the Ministry of \nFinance, and cash injections are common. However, the government has made a concerted effort \nto overhaul the legislative and regulatory framework for SOEs. In 2018, Cabinet approved a SOE \npolicy which establishes principles to guide SOE reform. In 2019, Parliament passed a SOE Act \nwhich  created  a  framework  for  SOEs  to  be  commercially  successful  while  establishing \naccountability and reporting arrangements. The Ministry of Finance has also established a Public \nEnterprise Monitoring Unit to review SOE performance and provide advice to the government on \nissues such as director appointments, community service obligations, restructure initiatives, \nportfolio issues and other SOE policy issues. \n \n6.  Solomon  Islands\u2019  PFM  system can meet  basic  objectives,  however, there  are core \nweaknesses which prevent policy decisions being executed to the desired effect or at all.7 The \nbudget is not prepared with sufficient baseline information and politically-driven reallocations are \nlate in the process and not strategic. Supplementary budget requests, virements and arrears are \nevidence of a budget process not aligned with limited cash resources. Though domestic revenues \nhave been increasing in recent years, the tax structure is outdated, inefficient, complex, expensive \nto administer and anticompetitive. The tax system relies on high rates applied to a narrow base \nwhich discourages people from becoming taxpayers and encourages tax avoidance and evasion. \nImportantly, the tax system does not actively support growth.89 \n \n7.  In  Vanuatu,  a  public  expenditure  and  financial  accountability  self-assessment  was \ncompleted  in  2015  to determine  the  progress  and  challenges  in  Vanuatu\u2019s  PFM  systems. \nSubsequent to that, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management prepared a PFM Reform \nRoadmap 2017\u20132021.10 The overall objective being to increase fiscal resilience, transparency \nand accountability. The PFM Reform Roadmap focuses on (i) enhancing controls to ensure \ncompliance in procurement, debt management, and payroll management; (ii) working towards \nmedium-term planning and budgeting; (iii) strengthening budget accountability; (iv) developing \nalternative sources of revenue; and (v) improving public investment and asset management.  \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n8.  Output 1: Program preparation assistance. Specialist expertise will support ADB and \nthe three governments in policy dialogue to identify areas where PFM reforms are required. ADB \nwill be responsible for leading the engagement with governments and developing policy matrices \nfor  ensuing  programs.  TA  consultants  will  help  develop  options,  background  papers  for \ngovernment  consideration,  priority  setting,  and  coordination  of  meetings  with  development \npartners. Where other development partners are also engaged in budget support operations or \nproviding PFM TA, policy dialogue will be done in conjunction with them. In Nauru, the first in a \nseries of programs focusing on improving public investment management will be completed by \nearly 2020. These programs focus on improving SOE performance, public procurement, continue \n                                                \n5  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2017.

The TA will \nsupport continued policy dialogue on more reforms to improve the financial performance and \nservice delivery of the SOEs and procurement planning, execution and monitoring. This work will \ninform the design of the Improving Public Investment Management Program 2. In Solomon Islands, \nADB is supporting the government\u2019s tax review.11 The tax review covers policy and legislative \nchanges in tax administration, income tax, customs duties, and other taxes. The tax review is also \ninvestigating introducing a value-added tax. The TA will support policy dialogue to help design \npolicy, regulatory and institutional reforms under the new tax legislative framework. In addition, \nthe  TA  will  support  ADB\u2019s  Increased  Domestic  Resource  Mobilization  sector  development \nprogram design and due diligence activities to help the Ministry of Finance and Treasury to \nimplement the legislative tax changes. Through policy dialogue for the budget support component \nof the sector development program, the TA will support implementation of PFM reforms in budget \nexecution,  especially  for  public  investments,  expenditure  management,  and greater  budget \ntransparency. In  Vanuatu,  the TA  will  support  policy  dialogue  to  prioritize  reforms,  ensure \ndevelopment  partners  are  coordinated  in  supporting  the  government,  and  help  design  the \nSustaining Economic Growth Program (Phase 1). This program will focus on medium-term \nbudgeting, improved analysis to determine investments in large infrastructure projects, PFM IT \nsystems, and debt management. Following the completion of that program, the TA will support \npolicy dialogue to design the Sustaining Economic Growth Program (Phase 2). Table 1 below \nprovides shows these details. In all program preparation activities, gender considerations will be \nassessed with a view to ensuring gender mainstreaming where appropriate. \n \nTable 1: Ensuing ADB Programs and Areas of Reform \nEnsuing Program  Year  Areas of Reform \nNauru:  Improving  Public  Investment  2021  State-owned  enterprise  reform,  procurement,  asset \nManagement Program 2  management, PFM IT systems, and budget transparency \nSolomon Islands: Increased Domestic  2020  Tax  administration,  tax  information management  systems, \nResource Mobilization Program  human  resource  management,  capacity  building  for  tax \nofficials,  budget  execution,  expenditure  management  and \nbudget transparency. \nVanuatu: Sustaining Economic Growth  2020/  Debt  management,  medium-term  budgeting,  economic \nProgram (Phases 1 and 2)  2022  analysis of infrastructure projects, PFM IT systems, and public \nfinancial management policy and legislative reform  \nIT = information technology; PFM = public financial management. \nSource: Asian Development Bank.   \n \n9.  Output 2: Support to implement PFM reforms. With a pipeline of ADB programs \nfocusing on PFM reforms in these DMCs, ADB is increasingly seen as a partner of choice to \nsupport  government  reform  efforts.  However,  these  governments  have  significant  capacity \nconstraints and once policy and institutional reform decisions are made, support is needed to \nembed the reforms. In Nauru, the TA will support the government to implement the new SOE \nAct.12 This support will be a combination of ongoing policy advice on SOE portfolio issues, \ncapacity building for the new SOE monitoring unit, and support to SOEs to help them meet their \nobligations under the SOE Act. In addition, support will also be provided, following Nauruan \ngovernment decisions, on public procurement, the PFM IT system and other PFM reforms. In \nSolomon Islands, ADB is providing ongoing advice on tax reform and this will continue under this \nTA. In addition, ADB is supporting activities to improve expenditure management, particularly for \n                                                \n11 ADB. 2017.

PSDI has as SOE \nreforms as one of its work streams, but its inputs are provided in short bursts. Given the thin capacity in Nauru, \nconsulting support to the Nauru Ministry of Finance needs to be long-term in nature. \n \n ", "4   \nlarge public investments, and the budget process, particularly work related to line agencies \nmeeting their PFM reporting obligations. This work will continue and be expanded.13 In Vanuatu, \nADB is providing support the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management in implementing its \nPFM Reform Roadmap.14 This work will continue under this TA, and support the government\u2019s \nrequest to revise their PFM Act and the outcomes from the review of their PFM IT system.  \n \nTable 2: TA Facility Support for PFM Reforms Implementation \nCountry  PFM Reform areas \nNauru  State-owned enterprise reform.

Output 3: Quality PFM research. To ensure ADB provides relevant, appropriate and \ntimely PFM policy advice and technical support, a solid base of research is required. Country-\nspecific  research  is  more  pertinent  to  governments  and  contributes  to  better  quality  ADB \nprograms. This TA will support research related to the linkages between PFM and sustainable \npublic investments. Some research topics being considered include: (i) calculating the deadweight \nloss from infrastructure investments through lower than expected asset lives, and the costs of \nhaving to replace these assets earlier; and (ii) case studies of each country\u2019s budget process to \nunderstand why there is a disconnect between capital investment decisions and allocation of \nongoing and adequate funding for maintenance, and opportunities for reform to reduce this \ndisconnect. The exact research question(s) will be refined in consultation with each government, \ntake into consideration future ADB programs and the potential to share the learning more widely. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-6). The  cost  estimates  and financing  plan  is  in \nAppendix 1. The TA scope may be expanded to cover additional activities, consistent with the \nTA\u2019s outputs, and be replenished as funds are required and identified, including cofinancing.  \n \n12.  Each government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, office supplies, and other in-kind contributions. The governments were informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing program. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The TA activities for an ensuing program will generally start after ADB approves the \nprogram concept paper.15 Concept papers for the ensuing programs listed in Appendix 2 are \nexpected to be approved during 2020 and 2021.  \n \n14.

Consulting services. The TA will finance international and national consulting services \non a combination of input- and output-based contracts. One consulting firm will be recruited to \nsupport the design of the Solomon Islands Increased Domestic Resource Mobilization Program \n(output 1) and one firm and individual consultants will support implementation of PFM reforms \nand undertake PFM research (outputs 1, 2 and 3).16 ADB will engage the consultants following \nthe ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project \nadministration instructions and/or staff instructions.17 The TA will maximize the use of available \nADB expertise and allow the participation of relevant staff as resource persons. \n \nE.  Governance  \n \n17.  Since ADB is the executing agency, the financial management, procurement and integrity \nrisks during TA implementation are assessed to be low.  \n \nII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Improving Pacific Public Financial Management Facility, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n                                                \n16 Two firms will be procured as the SOL: Increased Domestic Reform Management Program requires specialist \nexpertise in tax policy and administration, whereas the Nauru SOE program requires different expertise. It is unlikely \nthat a single firm will be able to provide this broad section of expertise. \n17 The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($\u2019000) \n \nItem  Amount \nA.

The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide three Pacific developing \nmember countries\u2015Nauru, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu\u2015with support to improve their public \nfinancial  management  (PFM)  systems.  The  TA  will  support  the  design  of  ensuing  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) programs. In addition, consultants will be mobilized to support the \ngovernment to implement PFM reforms, especially those already codified in country PFM reform \nroadmaps. Following on from completed ADB programs, the TA can support implementation of \ncompleted policy reforms to ensure they become embedded. Finally, the TA will also support \nresearch on PFM issues in these countries which will help inform future PFM reforms and ADB \nprograms. \n \n2.  Detailed terms of reference will be formulated for each output category and TA activity on \na case-by-case basis. ADB will evaluate government requests for assistance based on (i) \ngovernment  commitment  to  pursue  PFM  reforms,  (ii)  relevance  and  links  to  ongoing  and \nforthcoming ADB financed PFM programs, (iii) complementarity with development partners in \nterms of their support to PFM reforms, and (iv) specific research expertise to undertake PFM \nresearch relevant to each of the countries.  \n \n3.  The consulting inputs will be delivered with a combination of input-based and output-based \ncontracts. The determination of the type of contracts for the consulting firms will be made in \nconsultation with the government and after an assessment of the breadth of skills required to \ncomplete the TA activities. Similarly and dependent on the inputs required, the types of individual \nconsultant contracts (whether for international or national expertise) will be determined during the \nconsultant selection process. For the research consultants, once the research question is well \ndefined, these contracts can be output-based. The consulting firms (recruited through quality- and \ncost-based selection with a cost:quality ratio of 90:10) and individual consultants will be recruited \nin accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time). The \nconsultants required will need to have expertise in tax policy; tax administration; information \nmanagement, especially related to IT options, in taxation; PFM; budgets; debt management; \nstate-owned enterprise reform; procurement policy; public investments; asset management; \nmacro-fiscal analysis; and other experts as required. The specialists will have experience in their \nrespective  fields,  demonstrate  sound  technical  knowledge  and  preferably  have  experience \nworking in the Pacific context. Disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (as amended from time to time). The TA \nwill be implemented over 60 months, commencing August 2019 and the TA funds may be \nreplenished through additional financing and/or cofinancing.  \n \nB.  Firm and individual consulting requirements \n \n4.  Para. 16 and Table 3 in the TA Report describe the consulting services required under the \nTA. Detailed terms of reference are difficult to prescribe, especially for program preparation, as \nthe policy dialogue will be dependent on the respective governments\u2019 policy priorities at the time \nof processing. However, documents such as the PFM Reform Roadmaps and government policy \ndocuments can give guidance. It is likely that two firms will be required, but this may change \nfollowing discussions with the respective governments. Below are the outline terms of reference \nfor the two firms required and the individual consultants. \n \n ", "10     \n5.  Firm 1: SOL Increased Domestic Reform Management Program. Specialist expertise \nwill support ADB in designing the project component of this sector development program. The \nSolomon Islands government intends to present to Parliament in late 2019 three new Bills to \nmodernize the tax regime, namely: Tax Administration Bill, Value-Added Tax, and Customs and \nExcise Bill. ADB will support implementation of these tax reforms and a firm will be required to \nassess the Solomon Islands Inland Revenue Division and the Customs and Excise Division to \nassess what activities will be required to be undertaken in the project to ensure each division is \nable  to  successfully  implement the  new  legislative  requirements.  Some  of  the  work to  be \nundertaken and fed into design documents include: assessing the working arrangements of the \ntwo  divisions  and  if  restructuring  is  required;  assessing  the  staff  skills  and  capacity  and \ndetermining what training is needed; assessing if new areas of focus and skills are needed i.e. \ncompliance and risk management; assessing the current IT requirements and determining if IT \nupgrades are required whilst ensuring greater linkages between the IT systems of the Inland \nRevenue Division, Customs and Excise Division, and the Treasury Division; assess gender issues \nassociated  with  the  legislative  and  change  management  reforms  and  how  these  can  be \naddressed; and support to preparing documents such as the Project Administration Manual.  \n \n6.  Firm 2: NAU Support to implement the SOE Act. Nauru has requested ADB to support \ntheir Ministry of Finance to implement the recently passed SOE Act. A firm will be selected to \nundertake the following activities: engage with stakeholders so they understand the content, focus \nand timing of reforms to be implemented; a stocktake of Nauru\u2019s SOEs to assess the size and \nnature of gaps between current organizational arrangements and what the new Act requires; \nworking with SOEs to help them meet the requirements of the new Act, including giving training \nand specialist advice as required; working with the new Public Enterprise Monitoring Unit within \nthe Ministry of Finance to develop a work program, build capacity, developing processes and \napprovals for advice to the Minister of Finance related to SOEs; assess if SOE specific reforms \nare  required  i.e.  balance  sheet  restructuring,  financial  management  improvements,  human \nresource changes etc; and assess gender issues associated with the legislative and  SOE \norganizational reforms and how these can be addressed \n \n7.  Individual consultants. The TA will support ADB in preparing programs (see para. 8 of \nthe TA Report) and provide ongoing assistance in Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to implement \ntheir PFM roadmaps. The individual consultant needs will vary according to policy priorities of the \ngovernment,  direction  of  policy  dialogue  for  ensuring  programs,  and  development  partner \ncontributions. However, the activities which are likely to be undertaken include: procurement \nreform, asset management, budget transparency, tax policy reform, legislative drafting, tax \nmodelling,  debt  management,  medium-term  budgeting,  economic  analysis  of  infrastructure \nprojects, and PFM policy. Regarding Output 3, quality PFM research, the selected consultants \nwill need to have a extensive background in PFM research and potentially be engaged from \nresearch institutions such as think tanks or universities. In addition, the consultants will have to \nhave a body of PFM research related to the Pacific. This will enable them to draw on experience \nand personal contacts to ensure the research is focused on the most pertinent issues.
