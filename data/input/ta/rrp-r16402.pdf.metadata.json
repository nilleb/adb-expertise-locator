The  Project  will  employ  community \nmobilization to increase enrollments and reduce dropouts. It will \nsupport improvement programs to bolster attendance including \npreprimary  classes,  life-skills  training  and  school  development \nfund  awards  for  school  performance  in  3,400  existing  and \nupgraded elementary schools. The Project will build capacity at \nthe  school-community,  subdistrict,  district,  and  provincial \neducation offices to better plan, manage, budget, and monitor \nschool  performance,  especially  attendance,  and  to  strengthen \nlocal decision making and accountability. \n   \nRationale  Sindh Province wants to invest in its children so that they become \ngood, productive citizens who will participate in the economy and \nthe society. A province-wide public elementary school system will \nensure a quality public good equitably provided through targeting \nspecial groups to help reduce poverty. The Provincial Education \nDepartment  will  encourage  a  more  open  market  for  basic \neducational  services  by  providing  information  on  school \nperformance and ensuring universal access, especially to those \ngroups  least  able  to  afford  elementary  education.  The  Sindh \nGovernment is aware that economic development and poverty \nreduction  are  dependent  on  a  strong  foundation  of  basic \neducation  and  adult  literacy  in  the  population.  The  Millennium \nGoals  suggest  that,  unless  students  acquire  about  8  years  of \neducation, the numerous benefits of education may be lost.  \n   \nObjectives and Scope  The objective of the Project is to increase access to a pro-poor \ndecentralized public elementary school system with 60% of the \nbeneficiaries being the rural poor coming from the lowest 40% \nincome distribution. Increased access to elementary education will \nraise retention rates, especially for girls and the rural poor, leading \nto greater numbers continuing on to further schooling and to wider \njob  opportunities  for  those  leaving  school  after  class  8.  The \nProject  will  raise  the  quality  of  elementary  education  through \nprovision  of  stipends,  scholarships,  free  textbooks,  teacher \ntraining, and incentives to enable students to benefit from quality \neducation.  It  will  strengthen  decentralized  management  at  the \nprovincial,  district,  and  subdistrict  levels.  It  will  strengthen  the \npublic school system to more equitably provide public goods to \nfemales  and  the  poor  in  the  newly  decentralized  education ", "iv   \nsystem. By providing access to quality education, the Project will \nreduce inequities between public and private schools in Sindh. \n \nThe project area includes all 16 districts in Sindh including poor \nurban slums in Karachi. In each district, the Project will strengthen \n(i) the district education office, where district education officers \nreside and where planning, administration, and budgeting take \nplace;  (ii) the  subdistrict  education  offices,  where  the  deputy \nexecutive  district  officer  (education)  resides  and  decisions  are \ntaken on prioritizing school plans; and (iii) school management \ncommittees (SMCs), where parents and teachers decide school \npriorities. The Provincial Education Office employs a formula to \ndistribute funds based on population and need, and the Project \nwill fill funding gaps in the provision of resources to rehabilitate \nand upgrade schools based on local needs assessments. It will \nalso  help  to  mobilize  communities  through  nongovernment \norganizations,  community-based  organizations,  and  experts \nemploying  new  programs  in  preprimary  education,  life  skills, \nmadrasah curriculum training, and school development funds for \nimproved student attendance and teacher performance. \n   \nCost Estimates  The  estimated  project  cost  is  $97  million  equivalent,  of  which \n$18.8 million (19%) is the foreign exchange cost and $78.2 million \nequivalent (81%) is the local currency cost.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  ($ million)\n  Foreign  Local   \nSource  Currency  Currency  Total  Percent \nGovernment  0  22.0  22.0  23 \nADB  18.8  56.2  75.0  77 \n  Total  18.8  78.2  97.0  100 \nADB = Asian Development Bank. \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  It is proposed that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide a \nloan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights \n56,411,000 ($75 million equivalent) from the Asian Development \nFund. The loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, with an interest charge of 1% per year during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per year thereafter. ADB will finance \n100% of the foreign exchange cost of the Project, and 72% of the \nlocal  cost.  The  Government  will  finance  about  $22  million \nequivalent in local currency. The Government\u2019s share will include \nthe  financing  of  taxes  and  duties,  incremental  recurrent  costs \nincurred under the Project, and civil works. Contributions for civil \nworks provided by communities may also serve as part of the \nGovernment\u2019s share. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2008 \nCompletion Date \n ", "  v\nImplementation  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  the  16  district  education \nArrangements  offices,  which  will  be  responsible  for  day-to-day  planning, \nmanagement,  and  implementation  of  project  activities  in  the \ndistrict and will report to Executing Agency. \n   \nExecuting Agency  Sindh Provincial Education Department  \n   \nProcurement  All ADB-financed procurement for the Project will follow ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines  for  Procurement.  Each  contract  for  the  supply  of \ngoods,  vehicles,  equipment,  and/or  furniture  estimated  to  cost \nmore than $500,000 equivalent will be awarded on the basis of \ninternational  competitive  bidding  procedures,  while  contract \npackages of $500,000 equivalent or less will follow international \nshopping,  local  competitive  bidding,  direct  purchase,  or  local \nprocedures as applicable. Civil works contracts estimated to cost \nin total the equivalent of more than $200,000 will be awarded by \nlocal  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works  contracts  estimated  at \n$200,000  or  less  will  be  procured  using  the  borrower's  local \ncompetitive bidding procedures acceptable to ADB. Contracts for \nvehicles less than $500,000 will be awarded using international \nshopping. Furniture, equipment, reference and learning materials \nestimated  to  cost  $500,000  or  less  may  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  the  borrower's  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Minor items of equipment and \nmaterials  such  as  office  equipment,  furniture,  and  computers; \nvehicles and motor bikes estimated to cost less than $100,000 \nmay be procured directly from suppliers in accordance with PED's \nstandard  procurement  procedures  acceptable  to  ADB.  All  civil \nworks will be limited to existing school areas and will follow ADB's \nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. No \nresettlement or land acquisition is required. \n   \nConsulting Services  Specialist services for a total of 3 person-months of international \nexperts and 714 person-months of local experts will be selected \nand engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  acceptable  to  ADB  for \nengaging  domestic  consultants.  A  large  number  of  domestic \nconsultants are required because of the Project\u2019s emphasis on \ndistrict education office and SMC capacity building, monitoring, \nand  district-  and  school-based  project  implementation.  Major \nactivities  include  support  for  16  district  education  offices, \nstrengthening of SMCs, and completion of the detailed facilities \nand  staffing  inventory  of  elementary  schools  to  determine  the \nlong-term budgetary implications of sustaining the school system \nin Sindh.   \n \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  benefits  include  establishment  of  a  province-wide \nBeneficiaries  system  of  public  elementary  schools  that  provides  greater \nopportunities to students living in underserved areas. It provides \nimproved  education  including  preprimary  programs,  madrasah \nstaff training, life-skills, and school development funds to provide \nincentives  for  teachers  based  on  school  performance.  These \nprograms  along  with  needs-based  rehabilitation  for  boundary \nwalls,  toilets,  water  pumps,  additional  classrooms,  furniture, ", "vi   \nbooks, and staff training are designed to raise the quality and \nefficiency of school learning to reduce the dropout rate from 10% \nto 5% in classes 1-8 and increase class 8 completion rates from \n38%  to  55%  within  3  years  after  Project  completion.  Project \nbenefits also include extensive training in community mobilization \nfor parents; teachers; administrators; and subdistrict, district, and \nprovincial education officers to improve planning and monitoring of \nschool operations.  \n \nBeneficiaries include up to one million elementary school students \nin  3,400  elementary  schools  throughout  Sindh  including  1,400 \nupgraded classes 1-5 primary schools to classes 1-8 elementary \nschools. About 250 shelterless schools will be supported, and \nstudents  attending  classes  6-8  in  madrasah  schools.  About \n15,000  teachers  will  benefit  from  training  along  with  an  equal \nnumber of SMC members, administrators in 1,800 union council \noffices,  102  subdistrict  offices,  16  district  offices,  and  the \nprovincial education departments in Karachi and branch offices in \neach of four other regions of Sindh. The Project targets the rural \npoor so at least 60% of beneficiaries will come from the lowest \ntwo economic quintiles. About two-thirds of project beneficiaries \nwill be female. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  There are two project risks. The first has to do with the recurrent \ncosts needed for sustainability, especially after project completion. \nUpgrading  over  1,200  schools  to  full  elementary  schools  will \nrequire  additional  staff  based  on  a  decision  from  the  Sindh \nFinance Department to create and then fill sanctioned posts by the \nend of the Project. Teacher scholarships, incentives, and flexible \ncontracting  will  help  meet  recruitment  targets.  The  Project  will \nprovide incremental recurrent costs to cover the hiring of teachers \nduring project implementation when delays in appointments might \naffect progress. Covenants include assurances that Government \nwill take decisions to appoint adequate numbers of teachers for \nproject schools before project completion. The sustainability of \nstipends  and  free  textbooks  is  based  on  assurances  that  the \nGovernment will fund these interventions for girls in classes 6-8 \nafter project completion. \n \nThe  second  project  risk  has  to  do  with  Pakistan\u2019s  newly \ndecentralized  system  of  power  sharing.  The  plan  delegates \ndecision  making  to  the  local  level  so  that  stakeholders  take \nresponsibility  for  the  proper  functioning  of  schools.  As \ndecentralization is new, it is still unproven. The Project will provide \nfunds  for  continuous  training  of  provincial,  district,  and  local \neducation staff to supplement ongoing efforts by the Government. \nThe  Project  also  provides  incentives  in  the  form  of  innovative \nprograms for communities and local administrators to choose from \nin assuming responsibility for the education of children in each \ncommunity. Other ADB and funding agency adjustment credits \nand policy reform program loans that support decentralization will \nalso ensure that adequate funds are provided to the districts. \n ", " \n \n ", " \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Decentralized Elementary Education Project (Sindh). \n \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  For years, Pakistan has struggled to achieve universal primary education (classes 1-5) \nespecially in rural areas and for females. Throughout the 1990s, gross enrollment rates for \nprimary schooling increased from about 64% to 72%, while during the same period literacy rates \nfor those over age 10 years increased from about 34% to 45%. Enrollments in rural areas have \nincreased from 30% to 40%, while the gender gap has narrowed in favor of girls from about 40% \nto  30%  during  the  same  period.  These  accomplishments  have  taken  place  while  overall \npopulation growth has expanded at about 2% per annum, implying that enrollment growth has \naveraged almost 3% per year. In general, Pakistan made progress in spite of the Asian Crisis, \nwhich limited growth in the economy and accompanying curtailment of resources for education. \nThis was in part due specifically to the externally assisted Social Action Program (SAP) and \naccompanying  investment  projects  implemented  especially  in  the  early  1990s  to  upgrade \nschools.1  \n \n3.  The province of Sindh accounts for about 25% of the total class 1-8 elementary school-\naged children in Pakistan. Primary school enrollments in Sindh mirror those for the nation, as \nabout 67% of eligible students in Sindh attended classes 1-5 primary schools in 2000. However, \nonly 38% of 12-14 year olds in Sindh who graduated from primary schools progress to classes 6-\n8. This number is below the national average and, more importantly, has been dropping over the \npast 8 years from about 50% to 38% due to lack of expansion to accommodate larger cohorts of \nprimary school graduates. Furthermore, the private sector accounts for about about one third of \nthe classes 6-8 enrollment in Sindh, of whom almost all come from urban areas and families with \nincome above the median. The public sector school system accounts for about two thirds of class \n6-8 enrollment mostly from small towns and villages, where children come from poor families. The \npublic elementary school system is pro-poor because it meets the needs of the poor in rural \ncommunities. In the absence of private girls schools in rural areas, girls must rely on the public \nsystem for education. It is understaffed due to difficulties in providing class 1-8 schools in rural \ncommunities, where attitudes toward education, especially for girls, are often not conducive to \nschool attendance. In Sindh, inequities between the public and private elementary system mirror \nthe general inequities between rural and urban households. Because of the low quality of public \nschooling,  many  students  from  poor  families  are  gravitating  towards  the  madrasahs,  where \neducation is often narrowly focused on religious studies to the exclusion of broader subjects. \n \n4.  Based  on  an  analysis  of  household  surveys  and  social  impact  assessments,  Sindh \nrequested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help accelerate the expansion of class 1-8 \nelementary education to meet the Millennium Goals to provide a strong foundation for pro-poor \neconomic  recovery  and  poverty  reduction.  Sindh  wishes  to  follow  the  example  of  Punjab \nProvince,  which  already  provides  public  elementary  education.  With  only  about  38%  of \n                                                 \n1  School enrollment analysis carried out under SAP suggested that growth stagnated in the late 1990s even though \nmore girls than boys enrolled and large numbers of urban students deserted public for private schools during that \nsame period. It is likely that, once adjustments are made for withdrawal of the middle class from urban public \nschools, the public school enrollment growth of girls and the rural poor actually increased in the late 1990s. ", "2   \nelementary school children enrolled, it is difficult to change attitudes and behaviors until the \nmajority of the two million eligible 10-12 year olds are exposed to new ideas through schooling. \nOnly when the majority of Sindh children at a fairly young age are exposed to modern ideas and \nconcepts can reproductive health, consumer choice, good citizenship, and social mobility occur in \nrural communities. Significant improvements are needed for rural schools to enroll at least 50% of \nthe age cohort attending classes 1-8 (Appendix 1). \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n5.  Class 1-8 elementary education in Sindh faces several major constraints. Administrative \ncapacity has traditionally been weak and poorly financed, giving priority to classes 1-5 primary \nschools. Social service delivery has been inefficient, top down, and lacking local control. Under \nthe devolution of powers to districts that occurred in August 2001, various levels of government \nincluding districts, subdistricts and union councils have had their staff increased and provided \nwith general training in the new rules and procedures. Administration and funding decisions have \nbeen delegated so that communities and schools have more autonomy in prioritizing needs. \nNongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  community  volunteers,  and  school  management \ncommittees (SMCs) have been given more leeway to work as stakeholders to strengthen schools. \nInstitutional reforms under devolution have given authority to elected officials in combination with \nstrengthening of SMCs and school development funds (SDFs) through revised guidelines for \nstaffing assignments, auditing, and planning. An example of local delegation of decision making \nincludes training in planning and monitoring of school improvement so that rehabilitation and \nupgrading primary to elementary schools can be made based on need (Appendix 2).  \n \n6.  Under SAP, multisector approaches to education policy planning and budgeting took \nshape for the first time. From this approach, the federal and provincial governments along with \nexternal aid agencies began developing sector-wide approaches employing annual operational \nplans and data collection from educational management information systems in each province. \nADB is contributing to these efforts by focusing on Sindh province, where external assistance is \nweak but where the need is great and government commitment is high. This has led to looking at \na long-term strategy to rationalize assistance under the newly emerging devolved social service \ndelivery  with  emphasis  on  the  elementary  school  subsector.  The  process  approach  to  the \nsubsector supports the Millennium Goals of universal elementary education by 2015. It goes hand \nin hand with the implementation of devolution, as ADB is reinforcing district education plans for \nthe subsector that will yield a performance-based monitoring of school facilities, staffing, and \nresources tied to growth in school enrollments. ADB assistance to Sindh will be shared with other \nprovinces and with other aid agencies working in other subsectors, so lessons learned will get \ndisseminated widely. The investment project fits well with the wider aims of devolution and with \nthe subsector-wide efforts of ADB and other agencies to strengthen citizens' boards and district \nlevel management including ombudsmen and to provide checks and balances between elected \nofficials, NGOs, and school beneficiaries. \n \n7.  Finally, performance-based monitoring of the education system needs to more closely link \ncommunity awareness of school relevance to school enrollment drives. Sindh has an educational \ndatabase,  but  it  does  not  disaggregate  enrollments  for  the  elementary  school  sector  or \ndisaggregate growth by district. Furthermore, inputs are not compared with outputs, so system \nefficiency cannot be measured. ADB efforts to rationalize the elementary school system will help \nto document school improvement in a cost-effective manner so that district education plans can \nbe developed and targets measured. This will help to determine the precise staffing requirements \nbased on school demand, and will also allow educators to determine the effect of interventions \nsuch as school stipends on enrollment growth, especially for female students in classes 6-8.  \n ", "  3\n8.  The government strategy of both Pakistan and Sindh Province are designed to link basic \neducation to poverty reduction, especially through the Education for All targets set by UNESCO2 \nand subscribed to by the governments. Under the Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,3 the \nFederal Government has linked poverty reduction to elementary education through social capital \ncreation to sustain good citizenship, job creation, consumer information, and reproductive health. \nThe federal and provincial governments have initiated the Education Sector Reform4  (ESR) \nAction Program, which aims to raise gross enrollments as well as expand primary to elementary \neducation. The ESR is the Government\u2019s education policy and includes elementary education, \nmadrassah  education,  and  support  for  district  education  offices  and  SMCs.  Development \nexpenditure gaps identified under the ESR will be funded by external grants and through this \nproject  in  the  form  of  development  funds  for  innovative  programs  such  as  preprimary \n(kindergarten)  and  elementary  education,  and  community  mobilization  through  school \ndevelopment  funds.  The  Project  will  strengthen  ongoing  programs  to  support  local  teacher \nrecruitment and training, facilities and equipment upgrading, and district planning.  \n \n9.  The Government already has initiated its Devolution of Power5 plan for local government, \nwhich  is  expected  to  fundamentally  alter  the  way  educational  service  delivery  is  provided \n(Appendix 3). Devolution supports governance through greater transparency, an increase in the \nnumber  of  stakeholders,  greater  accountability  including  financial  auditing,  and  civil  service \nreform devolving more staff to the local level. The Project will strengthen many of these goals \nthrough provision of additional funds and training to increase stakeholder participation and to \nraise the level of educational services to meet stakeholder expectations. Equally important, the \nProject will support institutional strengthening at the provincial, district, and subdistrict levels \nthrough  needs-based  provision  of  development  funds  for  elementary  education  targeted  for \ncommunities. The Government of Sindh has initiated major financial reforms to strengthen social \nservice financing through increased provincial allocations, fiscal restructuring, federal support, \nsupport of the international community and public-private partnerships. Fiscal restructuring has \neliminated the need for debt servicing and has freed up funds to support education and health \nreform in the province. \n \n10.  A  major  lesson  learned  from  past  involvement  in  education  in  Pakistan  and  Sindh \nconcerns differentiating between macro policy planning versus micro-level project activities that \nprovide hands-on implementation experience. During SAP, multisector policies for all provinces \nwere pursued. While SAP made progress in coordinating these policies across provinces and \nsectors, it became clear that local implementation of these policies including institution building \nwas met primarily through large provincial education investment projects by ADB and the World \nBank. Consequently, both investment and program loans work best together to affect change in \neducation.  Another  lesson  learned  is  that  recurrent  costs  for  new  staff  are  important  for \nsustainability. Previously the Government imposed recruitment bans for project school staff, \nwhich  eventually  jeopardized  project  effectiveness.  To  strengthen  sustainability,  covenants \nseeking compliance on staffing are stressed as well as provision of support mechanisms under \nthe Project to ease the burden of incremental recurrent cost during project implementation. The \nProject  Performance  Audit  Report  (PPAR)  for  the  Primary  Girls  Education  (Sector)  Project6 \nrecommended that teacher deployment be closely linked with enrollments to improve internal \nefficiency in primary schools. The link between teacher deployment and student enrollment is \ncentral to building the elementary school system in Sindh. The Project will address this linkage \n                                                 \n2  United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). 2002. Education for All.

The  ADB  poverty  reduction  strategy  supports  pro-poor  growth  through  social  capital \nformation by raising literacy and schooling levels for social and labor mobility and for wider \neducational opportunities. The strategy encourages devolution of power to local authorities and \ndecision-making in education necessary for stakeholders to take responsibility for educational \nservice delivery. Finally, the ADB strategy and the Project support social sector governance8 \nthrough strengthening the implementation capacity at all levels of government including SMCs, \nunion councils, subdistrict, district and provincial education offices and staff. Most major aid \nagencies  provide  external  assistance  to  elementary  education  in  Pakistan.  Many  agencies \nparticipated under previous SAP programs and continue to support education through the ESR \nand Education for All programs led by the Federal Ministry of Education employing a partial \nsector-wide approach to educational management. The ADB past involvement in education in \nSindh Province in conjunction with the Project will make it the lead aid agency in the province to \nsupport education including provision of curriculum and staff training for madrasahs schools \n(Appendix 4). \n \n12.  Major external technical assistance to education in Sindh consists of macro- and micro-\nlevel approaches that support the Project. The World Bank plans a Provincial Adjustment Credit \nProgram loan in 2002 to strengthen financial and social sector policy reform along with ADB \nsupport for devolution. Funds provided will be used to guarantee additional resources for the \nsocial sectors to support investment projects. Other externally funded interventions in Sindh with \nthe European Commission as designated coordinator involve grant funding targeted for specific \npilot programs, many of which will reinforce the activities under the Project. These include (i) the \nEuropean  Commission  to  develop  training  for  local  officials  in  new  devolution  procedures; \n(ii) Nordic Aid to Development technical assistance to help strengthen SMCs; (iii) United Nations \nChildren's Fund to support the Children in School Program in one district and community support \nfor rural school programs through the Sindh Education Foundation; (iv) United States Aid to \nInternational Development to support basic education including standard setting in madrasahs; \nand (v) Canadian International Development Agency technical assistance for early childhood \nactivities including development of curriculum and materials for preschools.  \n \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objective \n \n13.  The objective of the Project9 is to increase access to a pro-poor decentralized public \nelementary  school  system.  Approximately  60%  of  the  beneficiaries  will  be  rural  children, \nespecially  girls,  coming  from  families  in  the  lowest  40%  income  level.  Increased  access  to \nelementary education will raise retention rates, especially for girls and the rural poor, leading to \ngreater numbers continuing on to further schooling and to wider job opportunities for those \nleaving school after class 8. The Project will raise the quality of elementary education through \nprovision of stipends, scholarships, free textbooks, teacher training, and incentives to enable \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1996.

It will strengthen decentralized management at the \nprovincial, district, and subdistrict levels. It will strengthen the public school system to more \nequitably provide public goods to females and the poor in the newly decentralized education \nsystem. By providing access to quality education, the Project will reduce inequities between \npublic and private schools in Sindh. \n \n14.  The project area includes all 16 districts in Sindh including poor urban slums in Karachi. In \neach district, the Project will strengthen (i) the district education office, where district education \nofficers reside and where planning, administration, and budgeting take place; (ii) the subdistrict \neducation  offices  where  the  deputy  executive  district  officers  (education)  (EDO)  reside  and \ndecisions are taken on prioritizing school plans; and (iii) SMCs, where parents and teachers \ndecide school priorities. The Provincial Education Office employs a formula to distribute funds \nbased on population and need, and the Project will fill funding gaps in the provision of resources \nto rehabilitate and upgrade schools based on local needs assessments. It will also help to \nmobilize  communities  through  NGOs,  community-based  organizations  (CBOs),  and  experts \nemploying new programs in preprimary education, life skills, madrasah curriculum training, and \nschool development funds for improved student attendance and teacher performance. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n15.  The Project has four components that support (i) school access, (ii) programs for female \nstudents, (iii) school quality improvements, and (iv) capacity building at the district offices. \n \n  1.  School Access \n \n16.  The first component builds access, especially for girls in rural areas, through needs-based \nassessment  among  the  community,  teachers  and  school  administrators.  Outputs  include \n(i) rehabilitation and upgrade of 1,200 primary to elementary schools (65% female schools) to \nincrease enrollments of the age cohort from 38% to 55% (25% to 45% for females) through \ndropout prevention and classroom efficiency for classes 6-8; (ii) establishment of two English \nMedium Model Schools (one for boys/one for girls) in each of 102 subdistricts; (iii) establishment \nof 1,000 preprimary classes in selective elementary schools (50% female) to promote age-class \nstandardization and encourage enrollment of the young to improve socialization skills and raise \nawareness of the importance of education; and (iv) conversion of 100 existing shelterless primary \nschools to elementary schools through community support and participation.  \n \n17.  Key activities include mobilization of SMCs and subdistrict education administrators to \nidentify needs-based priorities for schools (e.g., separate toilets for male and female students and \nstaff,  sitting  room  for  female  teachers,  additional  classrooms,  boundary  wall,  water  pump, \nfurniture, books, staff training) and to prepare school and district plans to improve elementary \neducation.  These  school  action  plans  will  be  tied  to  enrollment  projection  awareness  and \nstrategies to ensure that facilities are tied to enrollment growth. Other activities include district \nlevel education planning to ensure that the network of elementary schools covers each district \nand provincial monitoring to ensure that the public elementary system is adequately staffed and \nequitably serves the entire province.  \n \n  2.  Support for Girls\u2019 Education \n \n18.  Component two will provide community support to increase the social demand for girls\u2019 \neducation through (i) support for 3,400 SMC SDFs to encourage innovative programs to increase \nattendance and reduce dropout; (ii) free textbooks for all girls in classes 6-8; (iii) stipends for all \ngirls qualified on the basis of merit and need in class 8 who proceed to class 9-12; (iv) teacher ", "6   \nscholarships for female matriculates from local communities to attend classes 11-14 with the \nexpressed  purpose  of  attaining  a  bachelor  of  education  degree  for  teaching  classes  6-8; \n(v) support for public awareness campaign and provision of school learning materials; (vi) support \nfor a life skills program; and (vii) local fellowships for studies for 115 district educators (7 per \ndistrict and 35% female) to boost the number of qualified administrators in the districts.  \n \n19.  The key activities required to accomplish these goals include the use of NGOs to develop \nand introduce enrollment drive programs, textbook distribution, scholarships, life skills awareness, \nmaterials,  and  staff  training  to  widen  curriculum  in  madrasahs;  school  performance  reward \nprograms; and management training for SDF savings accounts. SMC members including parents, \nteachers, male and female counselors, NGO/CBO representatives, and school officials from the \nunion council will be included in the activities to introduce and regularize these programs in the \npublic elementary school system in Sindh.  \n \n  3.  Quality Improvement Training \n \n20.  The third component supports (i) local training of SMC members including NGOs and \nCBOs in school management programs; (ii) inservice training of master trainers and new class 6-\n8  teachers  in  curriculum  and  pedagogy,  to  be  carried  out  at  the  district  level  with  special \nemphasis on madrasah education, English language, and life skills training; (iii) administrative \ntraining for subdistrict, district, and provincial officers in planning, budgeting, and monitoring; \n(iv) preprimary school training of 1,000 teachers and teacher aides; and (v) development funds to \nsupport decentralization of education management and implementation of a performance-based \nmanagement system at district level. Districts will undertake training through the use of their own \nstaff, NGOs, and universities to support SMCs in the use of SDFs and preparation of school \nplans. Districts will also decide the venue to train new class 6-8 teachers, and the province will \ncoordinate across districts by providing master trainers. Training for class 6-8 teachers in those \nmadrasahs with students sitting for public examinations after class 5 and 8 will be provided \ntraining in the use of core curriculum textbooks (math, science, social studies, language, and life \nskills). Teachers completing training will be provided a set of 50 textbooks for their class. Districts \nwill also undertake training of teachers and teacher aides in preprimary education. \n \n21.  The  activities  menu  to  train  community-school  staff  and  representatives  will  include \nteacher  academic  in-service  training  to  be  engaged  by  the  province  through  the  provincial \ninstitutes of teacher education (PITEs), and training in effective textbook application for all female \nelementary school teachers. Training for SMCs and school staff will be carried out in union \ncouncil, subdistrict, and district office facilities for outreach training in financial budgeting and \nmonitoring  of  SDFs,  implementing  life  skills  training,  preprimary  school  programs,  SDF \nmanagement,  enrollment  projection  training,  school  planning,  and  administration  to  prioritize \nneeds.  \n \n  4.  Capacity Building for School Decentralization \n \n22.  The fourth component provides capacity building linked to devolution to sustain those \nquality improvements and increased student access through training provincial, 16 district, and \n102 subdistrict officials and 3,400 school principals in the administration, planning, management, \nand monitoring of school improvements. It includes  \n \n(i)  training  of  about  3,400  school  principals,  headmasters  and  teachers;  102 \nsubdistrict  officials;  16  district  officials;  and  provincial  officials  concerned  with \neducation,  in  administration,  planning,  management  and  monitoring  of  school \nimprovements; ", "  7\n \n(ii)  strengthening of 102 subdistrict education offices and 16 district education offices \nthrough staff training and provision of equipment and facilities, including recurrent \ncosts; and  \n \n(iii)  establishing  and  providing  facilities  for  a  project  implementation  unit  (PIU)  in \nKarachi to carry out monitoring and evaluation of the training and aggregating the \ndata collected by the districts. \n \n23.  The 102 subdistrict education offices and union councils will be strengthened to monitor \nthose elementary schools in their jurisdiction. Staff training among the subdistrict education \nofficers will include administrative supervision to support and approve community proposals to \nupgrade  elementary  schools;  staff  training  to  ensure  enrollment  projection  targets  and  data \ncollection; and training in monitoring SDFs. Other local office training will be provided in standard \noffice procedures in planning, budgeting, and administration needed to efficiently carry out duties; \nand equipment, computers, furniture, facilities, recurrent costs, and motor bikes for up to 102 \nsubdistrict offices will be provided to support local monitoring and supervision.  \n \n24.  Activities conducted by subdistrict education staff include supervision and monitoring the \ntraining carried out by NGO/CBOs among the various SMCs serving elementary schools in each \nof the roughly 17 union councils found in each of the 102 subdistrict in the Sindh. Staff will \naggregate the data from each of the approximately 10 new and 20 existing elementary schools \nfound in each subdistrict and forward the information to the district for inclusion in the elementary \nschool master plan.  \n \n25.  The 16 district level offices will be strengthened to improve their capacity to plan, manage, \nmonitor, and supervise the 102 subdistrict offices under their jurisdiction. Technical experts and \ntrainers will introduce training for education officers in each district in administration, supervision, \nmonitoring of enrollments, pass rates and dropout, and work plans to rationalize elementary \nschools and staffing in each district. Other training in routine administrative tasks under the newly \ndevolved decentralization system will also be provided to improve the efficiency of district offices. \nLearning  materials,  technical  experts  to  provide  training,  funds  for  facilities  rehabilitation, \nfurniture, computers, and a utility vehicle will be provided to the 16 district offices to ensure \nefficiency of operations. \n \n26.  Project staff located at the district education office including advisors and ombudsman will \nassist the EDO to conduct project activities throughout the district. The team consultant will work \nclosely with each of about 6 subdistrict deputy executive district officers (EDOs) to ensure that the \ndistrict program is carried out successfully in each subdistrict. The district team will include the \nfull-time district project officers or seconded staff and driver to meet with subdistrict education \nstaff on a regular basis to plan and implement project activities. \n \n27.  The Provincial Education Department (PED) will monitor and manage the elementary \neducation system throughout the province. Outputs include establishment of a PIU in Karachi to \ncarry out monitoring and evaluation of the training and aggregating the data collected by the \ndistricts. The province will also be responsible for coordinating district in-service workshops for \nnew teachers in classes 6-8 during summer vacation to be held at the PITE. Other training to be \ncarried out by the PIU includes training of district level staff in awareness of project activities and \nin the use of imprest account activities, approval of experts and NGOs for project activities, and \nproject studies to rationalize elementary school enrollments and teacher staffing and budgeting. \nInputs to complete these activities include facilities for the PIU and offices such as furniture, \nequipment, and computers; a utility vehicle; and consultants.  ", "8   \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n28.  The Project includes a number of special features new to education in Sindh Province. \nMany of these features have resulted from experimentation in the past on a small scale, while \nothers have resulted from recent institutional changes such as decentralization and emphasis on \npoverty reduction. Special features include the following: \n \n(i)  Decentralized school administration. The Government of Pakistan and all the \nprovinces have initiated devolution of power sharing to the districts and below. \nStarting in August 2001, the process is under way and represents a major attempt \nat institutional devolution of power to the local elected officials with the expectation \nthat local decision making and authority will lead to greater local accountability and \nefficiency  in  social  service  delivery.  In  education,  prospects  for  spending \nprioritization and deployment of teachers on contract and accountable to local \nofficials will improve school performance. The Project will support this process by \nproviding  development  funds  through  the  districts  based  on  local  needs \nassessment  and  will  lead  to  greater  efficiency  in  ensuring  that  resources  are \nutilized  where  they  are  needed.  Under  the  Project,  a  performance-based \nmanagement  system  will  be  implemented  at  the  district  level  to  monitor  the \nequitable distribution of educational resources within the district along with the \nenrollment  and  attendance  outcomes  on  which  the  resources  get  distributed. \n(Component 3) \n \n(ii)  Revolving funds. Under the Project, SDF accounts will be used to channel up to \n$1,000 each to SMCs for a host of innovative programs designed to improve \nschool  performance.  The  concept  that  local  control  of  resources  for  school \nimprovements is the basis for bottom-up changes in quality will be tested through \nthe use of the SDF. The SDF builds on the existing SMC school account started \nunder SAP but will expand the kinds of support from simple nonschool salary items \nsuch as chalk and maintenance to matching funds and incentives for student \nattendance, to stipends for girls and free textbooks, to scholarships for female \nteacher candidates. These programs will be administered through the SMC for \namounts  of  about  $1,000  per  school  (excluding  civil  works)  needed  to  fully \nestablish elementary schools. Funds will be provided based on a formula that \nrewards  school  attendance,  enrollment  growth,  and  dropout  reduction.  The \nprovincial  project  accounts  officer  will  monitor  the  disbursements  and \nreplenishments based on receipts provided by each SMC, and each SDF will be \naudited annually according to Government regulations. (Component 2) \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n29.  The total cost of the Project is estimated at $97 million equivalent, including physical and \nprice contingencies, taxes, and duties. Of the total cost, $18.8 million (19%) comprises the foreign \nexchange cost, and $78.2 million equivalent (81%) comprises the local currency cost. The Project \ncost estimate by component is summarized in Table 1. The Project will support civil works for \nrehabilitating  and  upgrading  primary  to  elementary  schools,  furniture,  equipment,  learning \nmaterials, staff development, specialist services and studies, special programs including stipends, \nscholarships, recurrent costs, taxes, and duties (Appendix 5). \n ", "  9\nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local  Total  % of Base \nProject Component  Exchange  Currency  Cost \n         \nI.

It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $75 million equivalent from its Special Funds \nresources (Asian Development Fund). The Borrower will be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The \nBorrower will pass on loan funds to Sindh Province on the same terms and conditions as those \nbetween ADB and the Borrower. The Borrower will assume the foreign exchange risk on the loan. \nThe loan will have a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years, with an interest charge \nof 1% per year during the grace period and 1.5% per year during the remaining term. ADB will \nfinance 77% of the Project cost, including 100% of the foreign exchange cost ($18.8 million) and \n72% of the local cost ($56.2 million). The Government will finance the remaining $22 million \nequivalent (28%) of local costs (Table 2).  \n \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n \n  Foreign  Local \nSource  Currency  Currency  Total  Percent \nGovernment  0  22.0  22.0  23 \nADB  18.8  56.2  75.0  77 \nTotal  18.8  78.2  97.0  100 \nSource: Appraisal Mission estimates. \n ", "10  \n31.  It is proposed that ADB finance 77% of the proposed Project cost due to (i) the severe \neconomic constraints in postcrisis Pakistan; (ii) the Project being nonrevenue generating and \nintended to support public elementary schooling for poor children and capacity building for local \ngovernments, schools, and communities; and (iii) local governments under the newly devolved \ndecentralization having to finance the majority of the counterpart requirements, with the provincial \ngovernment responsible for the stipend program and recurrent costs. The Project has strong \nsocial aspects. It is classified as a poverty intervention, targets females and the poor in rural \nareas, and expects pro-poor impacts in reducing inequity in basic education opportunities. Loan \nallocation across districts is based partly on the estimated number of children below the poverty \nline, so poor areas will get additional benefits (Appendix 6).  \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n32.  The Project Executing Agency will be PED in Karachi. A project steering committee \nchaired by the Education Secretary and including one elected nazim,10 two selected members \nrepresenting  all  the  16  districts,  finance  and  planning  and  development,  the  PIU  director \n(recording  secretary),  one  SMC  representative  representing  all  16  districts,  and  one \nrepresentative of the community citizen's board will meet every 6 months to review progress and \napprove plans for the coming year. It will be established within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \nThe PIU will be established by PED and consist of professional staff comprising a director; deputy \ndirector; and accounts, monitoring, evaluation, and procurement officers. Within 3 months of loan \neffectiveness, each district will assign a full time district project coordinator (DPC) to assist the \nEDO to implement the project activities. The DPC will be responsible for preparing district plans \nand will request approval of funds from the PIU for project activities. The DPC will also organize \nthe program at the district level and travel to each subdistrict office to help the additional district \nofficer monitor the elementary schools under his/her jurisdiction. The subdistrict education officer \nwill be responsible for monitoring the SMC requests. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n \n33.  The Project will be implemented over 6 years, starting in January 2003, and will be \ncompleted in 2009. All 16 districts will provide deputy EDOs and resources to implement the \nProject in each of the 102 subdistrict education offices in Sindh (Appendix 7).  \n \n3.  Procurement \n \n34.  The Project will upgrade 1,200 primary to elementary schools, and 204 subdistrict model \nschools.  About  1,000  elementary  schools  will  receive  facilities  for  preprimary  classrooms, \nfurniture, equipment, and learning materials. Furniture, equipment, reference/learning materials, \nand transport will also be provided to all district and subdistrict offices. Procurement will follow \nADB's Guidelines for Procurement. Civil works contracts estimated to cost in total the equivalent \nof  more  than  $200,000  will  be  awarded  by  local  competitive  bidding.  Civil  works  contracts \nestimated at $200,000 or less will be procured using the borrower's local competitive bidding \nprocedures acceptable to ADB. Contracts for vehicles less than $500,000 will be awarded using \ninternational shopping. Furniture, equipment, reference and learning materials estimated to cost \n$500,000 or less will be procured in accordance with the borrower's local competitive bidding \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB.

These  small-scale  civil  works  for  upgrades, \nrehabilitation,  and  preprimary  classrooms  will  utilize  local  competitive  bidding  and/or  local \nprocedures  acceptable  to  ADB  based  on  procedures  already  working  under  ongoing  ADB-\nfinanced projects for design standards of classrooms, toilets, boundary wall, water pumps, and \nmultipurpose classrooms.11  \n \n35.  Selection criteria for upgrading primary to elementary schools (65% girls\u2019 schools) have \nalready been determined, and SMCs will have to guarantee meeting the criteria through a brief \nquestionnaire before schools will be approved by districts. The selection criteria to upgrade \ninclude the following: \n \n(i)  maximum of one upgraded school per union council; \n(ii)  existing land adjacent to school, and at least two classrooms and a veranda; \n(iii)  existing enrollment of class 5 of at least 20 girls; \n(iv)  adequate students in the catchment area to enable a minimum enrollment of 35 \nstudents per class with at least 20 female students in class 5; and \n(v)  SMC commitment to fund 10% of the total cost. \n \n36.  Selection  criteria  for  choosing  existing  or  new  elementary  schools  for  preprimary \nprograms include the following: \n \n(i)  School already has a kachi12 class with an enrollment of 30. \n(ii)  SMC will guarantee finding a teacher (trained or untrained). \n(iii)  SMC can show that the preprimary school program will improve the class 1-5 \nenrollment. \n(iv)  Parents will attend meetings. \n \n37.  Environmental  implications  were  reviewed  and  no  significant  adverse  environmental \nimpacts were identified. All civil works will be limited to existing school areas and will follow ADB's \nEnvironmental Guidelines for Selected Infrastructure Projects. No resettlement or land acquisition \nis required (Appendix 8). \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n \n38.  Specialist services required for a total of 3 person-months of international experts and 714 \nperson-months  of  local  experts  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for engaging \ndomestic consultants.

Suitable  NGOs,  universities, \nteacher  training  colleges,  institutions,  firms  or  district  master  trainers  will  be \nidentified  to  pull  together  existing  materials  and  equipment  including  training \nmaterials  and  prepare  a  program  to  introduce  preprimary  classes  to  1,000 \nelementary schools throughout the province based on a questionnaire prepared by \nSMCs and reviewed by local and district officials.  \n \n(ii)  Curriculum Materials Training Program. Suitable NGOs, universities, teacher \ntraining colleges, institutions, firms or district master trainers will be selected to \nconduct in-service training for master trainers and new teachers in the use of \nlearning materials, textbooks, and other school equipment over 6 years of project \nimplementation. Special academic training will include (a) life skills awareness to \nprepare an awareness campaign and materials for class 6-8 students in 3,400 \nschools; (b) madrasah curriculum modernization in mathematics, science, social \nstudies, and language on a voluntary basis to those madrasahs with students \ntaking tests to enter the formal system in class 6 and 9.  \n \n(iii)  Financial  Management  and  School  Development  Fund  Training.  Suitable \nNGOs, universities, teacher training colleges, institutions, firms or district master \ntrainers will be identified to design and implement on-the-job training for SMC \nmembers, to operate SDFs to accommodate stipend, scholarship, free textbook, \nand teacher incentive programs in each of the 3,400 elementary schools. The \nSMC  training  will  also  include  shelterless  school  training  to  pilot  innovative \ncommunity mobilization to upgrade about 250 shelterless schools with potential to \nbecome elementary schools. Training will be linked to awareness campaigns and \ninclude  use  of  district  ombudsmen,  community  citizens'  boards,  and  other \nagencies set up under district offices. \n \n(iv)  School  Organization  Management  Program.  Suitable  NGOs,  universities, \nteacher  training  colleges,  institutions,  firms  or  district  master  trainers  will  be \nidentified to design and implement on-the-job training in district and subdistrict \noffices for routine supervision and monitoring activities required to maintain an \nactive district-wide work program. \n \n6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n40.  To expedite the disbursement of loan funds, the Government will establish an imprest \naccount at the National Bank of Pakistan, Karachi. The imprest account will be established, \nmanaged, replenished, and liquidated in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \ndated January 2001 and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government of Sindh and \nADB. The ceiling for the use of statement of expenditure (SOE) procedures will be $100,000 \n(Loan Disbursement Handbook, para. 9.17). Initially, the ceiling of the imprest account will not \nexceed $1 million or $0.250 million for each subaccount. Limits for SDFs and district level imprest \nsubaccounts will be approved by the PIU. The districts and schools will use SOE procedures to \nliquidate advances and keep records and receipts on file. The PIU will disburse funds directly for \nthose activities managed by the PIU including for consultants, province-wide academic training, \nand monitoring. Funds for district programs will be transferred to district subaccounts by the PIU \nupon receipt of work plans for eligible items. DEOs will transfer SDFs to SMCs for civil works less ", "14  \nthan $2,500, stipends, teacher scholarships, and innovative programs. The flow of funds will be \nfinalized  by  the  PIU  and  district  offices  and  procedures  noted  in  the  Project  Administration \nMemorandum. \n \nEligible items for disbursement by districts include \n \n(i)  civil works budgets for approved rehabilitation and upgrading; \n(ii)  furniture budgets \n(iii)  science, equipment, computer, preschool furniture, and equipment; \n(iv)  staff training; \n(v)  technical experts for all staff training; and \n(vi)  all items for disbursement by SMCs. \n \nEligible items for disbursement by SMCs include \n \n(i)  textbooks for girls\u2019 schools, \n(ii)  stipends for needy girls, \n(iii)  scholarships for female teacher candidates, \n(iv)  staff salaries for part-time teacher aides from the community, and \n(v)  other innovative programs approved by district officer. \n \n7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n41.  The Sindh Government will ensure that records and accounts are maintained to identify \nthe goods and services financed from the loan proceeds. Separate accounts for the Project will \nbe maintained and audited annually in accordance with sound auditing standards acceptable to \nADB. A separate opinion on the use of the imprest account and SOE will be included in the \nannual audit report. Certified copies of such audited accounts will be submitted to ADB within 12 \nmonths  after  the  close  of  each  fiscal  year.  The  PIU  will  prepare  quarterly  reports  on  the \nimplementation of project-funded activities. The report will be in a format acceptable to ADB, and \nwill indicate progress made against established targets, problems encountered during the quarter, \nsteps taken and steps proposed to resolve the problems, compliance with loan covenants, and \nproject activities to be undertaken during the next quarter. A project completion report will be \nprepared within 3 months of the physical completion of the Project.  \n \n42.  The Mission explained the ADB anticorruption policy, particularly the section on fraud and \ncorruption,  as  stated  in  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement  and  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants. Project accounts including accounts held for SDF, district imprest subaccounts, and \nthe PIU imprest account will be audited annually by independent auditors; the loan allocation \nprovides financing for this activity. \n \n8.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n43.  Performance monitoring will be based on gender-segregated collection of baseline data \nunder the Project, from the ongoing household survey, the education management information \nsystem  in  Sindh,  and  the  ongoing  district  education  baseline  monitoring  by  the  Multidonor \nSupport Unit established under SAP.13 The baseline data include individual school enrollment \ndata  by  class  and  gender  with  information  provided  on  pass  rates  by  class,  dropout,  and \n                                                 \n13 Federal Bureau of Statistics, Pakistan. 1999.

Karachi; \nMultidonor Support Unit. 2002. The District Education Profiles. Islamabad. ", " 15\nattendance. As each school joins the Project, these data will be routinely collected and provided \nto the district and province for monitoring. The household survey also serves as a form of third \nparty monitoring along with the educational management information system established under \nSAP.  Areas  for  monitoring  include  (i)  program  and  financial  compliance,  (ii) progress  and \nperformance monitoring, (iii) benefit evaluation, and (iv) transition monitoring of decentralization \nimpact on management and service delivery. The Project will generate this information at the \ndistrict level in Sindh. The ADB Project Performance Management System (PPMS) will provide \nthe framework for project monitoring. \n \n44.  Target  performance  will  be  monitored  by  districts  (coordinated  by  the  PIU)  through \nenrollment growth, dropout, and completion rates at the end of class 5 and class 8. For SMCs, \nprogress will be maintained against school improvement plans, including the success of SDF-\nfinanced activities. Benefit evaluation will be measured qualitatively against the stated goals of \nimproving the number of class 6-8 enrollments, attendance, and delivery of programs, and from \nthis the cost effectiveness of programs can be determined. In addition, the performance-based \nmanagement systems at the provincial and lower levels will be based on management- and \nbudget-related performance indicators. These will be defined with the help of local beneficiaries, \nand the indicators linked to budgets that are monitored regularly. \n \n9.  Project Review \n \n45.  Given the labor intensive nature of decentralization, institutional reform, and capacity \nbuilding, the Project approach will be long term, and monitoring will be process oriented rather \nthan output oriented. Targets will be adjusted according to performance. Comprehensive reviews \nof  project  performance  will  be  conducted  at  the  end  of  the  second  and  fourth  year  of \nimplementation. The first review will focus on the success of the implementation procedures for \nSDF funds flow, social targeting, and survey study implementation to rationalize elementary \nschool  facilities,  staffing,  and  funding.  The  second  review  will  focus  on  overall  benefits, \nachievements,  and  necessary  restructuring  and  reallocation  of  project  funds.  Financial \ncompliance monitoring will focus on agreed upon criteria and guidelines established by the PIU to \nensure funds flow to districts and SDF accounts so that transparency is maintained and audits \nare carried out annually. PIU and district office project staff will visit schools randomly to conduct \ncompliance  audits,  and  project  experts  will  build  in  compliance  standards  based  on  school \nattendance records versus lists of stipend holders and number of free textbooks distributed. \n \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n46.  Sindh wants to develop economically and socially by reducing poverty and raising its \nhuman resource base so that rural areas can benefit from economic activity generated in Karachi, \nHyderabad, and Nawabshah. To accomplish this, Sindh must raise the province\u2019s education level \nfrom the class 1-5 primary school system to a class 1-8 elementary school system. The Project \nwill support all existing 2,000 class 1-8 public elementary schools and provide upgrading from \nprimary to elementary for an additional 1,400 selected schools, especially in rural areas (65% \nfemale) leading to a province-wide public elementary system that will eventually serve 55% of all \neligible 10-12 year olds. Consequently, about 500,000 existing class 6-8 public school students \nwill  benefit  from  the  project  along  with  an  additional  168,000  students  who  will  have  the \nopportunity to attend classes 6-8 for a total of 668,000 students enrolled annually in classes 6-8 \nby 2009. In addition, the Project will provide faculties, furniture, equipment, learning materials, \nand  training  to  200,000  class  1-5  students  in  1,400  project  schools.  Under  the  program, \napproximately  1,000  schools  will  commence  preprimary  classes  for  approximately  30,000 ", "16  \npreschoolers (50% female). Selected madrasah schools will be provided teacher training in class \n6-8 core subjects. \n \n47.  Approximately  5,000  new  teachers  (65%  female)  serving  in  elementary  schools  will \nbenefit from the Project through academic and administrative training. About 4,000 education \nsupervisors and administrators and 10,000 parents and community leaders will benefit from \ntraining  in  school-community  mobilization.  These  beneficiaries  will  provide  the  impetus  for \nstrengthening and expanding the elementary school system in Sindh, especially in rural areas. \nIndirect beneficiaries include the labor required to upgrade and rehabilitate schools and build \nfurniture, book distributors, employment for about 5,000 new teachers in rural areas over 9 years, \nlocal hiring of community workers in the area of life skills training, and preprimary education and \nteacher aides. Local NGOs and technical experts will also benefit by providing leadership training \nand  technology  transfer  in  rural  areas,  and  about  3,000  women  will  benefit  from  teaching \nscholarships  and  about  75,000  class  6-8  girls  will  receive  annual  stipends  through  school \nsubsidizes to reduce dropout and increase retention rates. \n \n48.  The Project will provide substantial beneficial impacts. It will enable Sindh to establish and \noperate province-wide pro-poor public class 1-8 elementary schools serving students in rural and \npoor  areas.  The  elementary  system  will  be  based  on  surveys  rationalizing  school  facilities, \nstaffing, and budgeting of approximately 3,400 elementary schools. The impact of a province-\nwide public elementary school system will raise the level of education in the province and reduce \nthe gap between the urban and rural, male and female enrollments.  It will also reduce the gap \nbetween the public and the private elementary school system in the province. The Project will \noffer parents and students a low-cost accessible system of public education in rural areas through \nclass 8. Class 8 is considered to be the minimum level of education needed to ensure sustainable \ncognitive  skills  and  knowledge  needed  in  a  modern  economy.  Social  externalities  include \npromotion of health and population welfare for future mothers, good citizenship, and efficient \nconsumerism required for effective social living. Furthermore, an elementary school system built \non community participation and decentralized decision making is likely to increase the demand for \neducation based on need and to stimulate social welfare in the form of participatory democracy \nand understanding of the importance of education for improving the quality of life (Appendix 11).  \n \n49.  The impact of the Project on the education system is expected to be great. First, the \nProject supports the shift to decentralized management of educational services to the district level \nand below, where management and budgeting will lead to operational decisions taken close to \nthe user. Decentralization brings together elected district officials and citizens to decide on school \npriorities  throughout  the  district.  Under  devolution,  educational  decision  making  and  data \ncollection at the subdistrict level will be strengthened through additional facilities, staff, and \nbudget resources to monitor individual school staff and SMCs. The Project will support activities \nthat allow local decisions to prioritize educational needs taken within schools and communities to \nfind  their  way  to  the  district  for  approval.  Efforts  to  involve  parents  through  SMCs  and \ncommunities  through  citizens'  boards  will  have  a  positive  impact  in  support  of  devolution. \nLikewise, the Project will enable the SDFs managed by SMCs to be strengthened and expanded \nto cover selected school improvement activities managed by parents and teachers that lead to \ngreater accountability of the community in taking responsibility for the education of their children. \nFinally, at the provincial level, the project impact will be to strengthen the role of the province \nunder devolution to monitor inputs and outputs across districts in the province.  \n \n50.  At the school level, the project impact will help to ensure that quality improvements to \nelementary  education  are  based  on  need,  leading  to  improvements  in  school  attendance, \ncompletion rates and dropout reduction throughout classes 1-8. The introduction of preprimary \neducation  designed  around  socialization  skills  will  help  to  encourage  positive  attitudes  of ", " 17\npreschoolers once they enter class 1, which will lead to lower dropout and improved learning \nreadiness  among  first  graders.  The  Project  will  impact  school-community  relations  through \nmobilization of the SMCs linked to the principals and to the school supervisors at the union \ncouncil and subdistrict education offices. This participatory approach has often been lacking and \nhas  been  partly  responsible  for  the  top-down  approach,  which  lacked  ownership  within  the \ncommunity.  The  innovative  attempts  to  strengthen  the  SDF  through  small  grants  rewarding \nschool performance, especially through student and teacher attendance, is another impact that \nwill strengthen the quality of elementary education in Sindh.  \n \n51.  Girls are underrepresented in elementary education for economic and social reasons. \nGirls will attend school if classes 6-8 are available not too far from home. This is the major \nproblem preventing female enrollments from rising above 30%. Issues of opportunity costs, child \nlabor, and cultural norms dictating little education for females will always be a problem, but the \nproject focus will be on getting the first 50% of girls into school. Recurrent costs for stipends and \nfree textbooks will be implemented for all class 6-8 females as a result of the Project. The Project \nwill prepare a gender strategy to mainstream girls elementary education in Sindh.  \n \n52.  Ethnic minorities such as Hindu, Christian, and Sikh are small in number but may be \ncongregated  in  some  districts  more  than  others.  In  some  cases,  local  language  sensitivity \nprevents minorities from doing well in school. The Government has a policy of mainstreaming \nminorities and second language learners. In such cases, learning materials and training prepared \nunder the Project will be automatically provided in the Urdu and Sindi languages, and the PIU will \nrequest technical experts to offer guidelines to district officials to ensure mainstreaming of all \nchildren into the formal education system. \n \n53.  Likely risks in implementing the Project in Sindh Province are well known from past \nprojects and from the many aid agency reports and government studies commissioned to make \nrecommendations. However, the integrated benefits and impacts far outweigh the costs given \nthese risks (Appendix 12). \n \nA.  Financial Risk \n54.  The main financial risk is the potential inability of each district to sustain recurrent funds \nfor the salaries of new teachers to be deployed in project schools in classes 6-8. Federal, \nprovincial, and district officers negotiate budgets annually. The Project provides for incremental \nrecurrent costs to support the process of teacher deployment during project implementation. \nHowever,  recurrent  funds  for  teacher  salaries  made  after  project  completion  represent  a \ncontinuous  charge  to  the  provincial  finance  department.  World  Bank  and  ADB  program \nadjustment credits will help to ensure increased social sector budgets based on policies to \nsupport education over the long term. The financial analysis of the province\u2019s education budget \nrevealed that the recurrent costs under the Project represent a small increase in the overall \nallocation for staffing when averaged over 6 years of project implementation and another 3 years \nafter project completion as project staff are fully utilized. Covenants are provided to ensure that \nadequate staff budgets for project schools are provided. The need for accurate financial data to \nbudget the public elementary school system requires a comprehensive survey that looks at the \nfacilities, enrollments, staffing and budgeting of elementary schools. The survey to be carried out \nunder the Project will serve as the baseline and help to develop the enrollment projection system \nto  measure  progress.  Budgets  for  stipends  and  free  textbooks  for  classes  6-8  girls  will  be \nrequired after project completion, and assurances have been given that the policy of stipends and \nfree textbooks for girls will be expanded to classes 6-8. The Federal and provincial governments \nhave recently separated the auditor general and accountant general functions, which will help to \nensure independent audits, especially at the district level under devolution. Likewise, under ", "18  \nsector-wide  technical  assistance,14  consistent  budget  classification  systems  have  been \nintroduced throughout the country to again improve compliance and monitoring.  \n \nB.  Social Risk \n55.  Social targeting of the poor and females, especially in rural areas, may lead to abuse in \nallocating student stipends and teacher candidate scholarships by SMCs in some schools. SMC \ntraining by gender specialists in selection and monitoring procedures for these programs will be \ncritical  for  success.  It  is  widely  acknowledged  that  full  participation  leading  to  a  full  need \nassessment will improve transparency, and this is why extensive training of SMC members, \nteachers, and local school administrators is essential to ensure that project funds are effectively \nutilized. Consequently, the main social risk includes the potential weakness of SMCs to mobilize \nfemale  teachers  to  serve  in  the  communities.  Under  devolution,  teacher  appointment  and \ndeployment have been localized, and the Government will increase the budget for primary and \nelementary education. The Project provides for scholarships to young candidates along with \nadditional funds to hire teacher aides from the community to assist in classroom activities. \n \nC.  Policy Risk \n56.  The main policy risk under the Project is the potential inability of each district to take \naction to fill gaps in the public elementary school system once recommendations from the project \nsurvey are known. Covenants have been included to ensure that action is taken on time and \npolicy analysts provided. School-community mobilization will be key to building awareness and \naccountability into the system. It is labor intensive and requires a strong commitment to draw on \ncontinuous NGO/CBO expertise in communities and to build awareness and capacity among \nindividual schools. The Project provides adequate funds for capacity building, but since mostly \nonly NGO expertise is available to provide many of the activities, it is critical that district and \nprovincial governments recognize the importance of NGO participation to build capacity. \n \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n \n57.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Sindh Government and the PED have given \nthe following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n  (i)  General \n \n(a)  To rationalize the efficiency of the elementary school system, the PED will ensure \nthat a survey of elementary school facilities, administration and teaching staff, and \nschool budget for all existing and new schools under the Project is carried out \nwithin 2 years after loan effectiveness, and findings are reflected in the provincial \nand district plans to hire and finance adequate teachers a year later. \n(b)  In the first year of implementation, the PED and EDOs will prepare an elementary \nschool incentive program to encourage student enrollment and prevent dropouts. \nThe  incentive  program  will  include  a  formula  to  be  agreed  upon  with  and \nprocedures acceptable to ADB to support needy girls in each elementary school \nfor 5 years (classes 6-10) based on poverty and merit. Funds will be provided \ndirectly to the girls.  \n(c)  Based on the education monitoring and information system and other databases, a \ngender-segregated PPMS will be implemented in each district in the second year \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2001. Technical Assistance to Pakistan for Fiscal Decentralization. Manila.  ", " 19\nof implementation and updated annually. The database will serve to measure the \nprogress  of  enrollments,  attendance,  and  dropout  and  pass  rates  for  all  the \nelementary schools in Sindh. The PPMS will ultimately determine district fiscal \ntransfers, incentives, and allocation formulas based on PPMS results. The results \nof the study survey will be used to develop the baseline. \n(d)  Each primary school that seeks upgrading to an elementary school will submit its \nplan to the district, to include pertinent information on school facilities, enrollments, \nstaffing, and the budget commitment of the SMC before EDO approval is granted. \n(e)  Life skills awareness programs for classes 6-8 will be developed and implemented \nin all class 6-8 classes within 2 years from loan effectiveness. \n(f)  Preprimary  school  programs  in  1,000  schools  (50%  girls'  schools)  will  be \ndeveloped  and  implemented  on  a  phased  basis  within  2  years  after  loan \neffectiveness. \n(g)  Training of SMCs, master trainers, new school staff, and administrators will begin \nin a phased manner within 9 months of loan effectiveness. \n(h)  All  project  activities  including  or  affecting  ethnic  minorities  will  take  into \nconsideration  local  language  preferences  of  the  ethnic  minorities  and  provide \nlearning materials developed under the Project as well as trainers and facilitators \naccordingly. \n(i)  Free  textbooks  for  girls  introduced  under  the  Project  to  classes  6-8  will  be \ncontinued after project closing through notification approved within 5 years of loan \neffectiveness.  \n \n(ii)  Staffing \n \n(a)  The EDOs will develop a policy for hiring teachers in existing and new elementary \nschools based on local recruitment and will implement it within 2 years of loan \neffectiveness. The plan will include hiring of local teachers on a contract basis with \nopportunities  for  training,  and  teacher  assistants  and  preprimary  school  paid \nvolunteers on a temporary basis and paid through SDF. \n(b)  EDOs will ensure that all schools implementing preprimary classes identify teacher \npositions including paid community helpers before any decision is taken to provide \nfacilities and training. \n \n(iii)  Selection \n \n(a)  Selection of primary schools for upgrading to elementary schools will be based on \nselection criteria. The first batch of 250 schools will be identified within 2 months of \nloan  effectiveness,  the  second  batch  of  250  schools  within  1  year  of  loan \neffectiveness, and the remaining 500 schools within 2 years of loan effectiveness. \n(b)  Elementary schools will be selected for preprimary classes based on selection \ncriteria, with 250 (25%) selected within 3 months of loan effectiveness. \n(c)  The selection of NGOs to undertake school-community mobilization will follow \nguidelines  developed  under  the  SAP  participatory  development  program  or \ngovernment procedures used under ADB projects. \n(d)  Special measures will be implemented to promote the participation of women in \nproject activities. SMCs will include at least one female parent and teacher, a \ncounselor,  and  one  representative  from  a  CBO/NGO.  Student  stipends  and \nteacher  training  scholarships  will  be  provided  to  females;  textbooks  will  be \nprovided to all class 6-8 female students; and 65% of new elementary school \nupgrading will be done in girls schools (Appendix 12). ", "20  \n(e)  Special measures will be taken to promote the participation of rural schools in \nproject activities based on the poverty level of each district to ensure that poor \nschools are adequately represented in the Project.  \n(f)  Needy  girls  in  classes  9-12  will  be  selected  by  schools  and  academic  tests \nadministered to determine 25% of the school\u2019s needy female enrollment based on \nmerit. Stipends will be administered to each girl until completion of class 10. In the \nfinal year of project implementation, the government will have in place a policy to \nprovide needy girls in classes 9-12 with stipends to encourage school attendance. \n \n(iv)  Finance \n \n(a)  Unless  otherwise  agreed  upon,  loan  proceeds  will  be  transferred  from  the \nprovincial imprest account to district imprest subaccounts. School development \nfunds will be transferred from district imprest subaccounts as requested by SMCs. \n(b)  SDFs will be established in local banks near project schools, and funds from EDOs \nwill be transferred to these project schools on an annual basis for innovative \nprograms agreed upon with the districts and the PIU. \n(c)  A student stipend program will be established for disadvantaged girls in existing \nand new classes 9-12 schools based on the Government's ongoing programs. \n(d)  The award, distribution, and use of the SDFs and district imprest subaccounts will \nbe  monitored  in  accordance  with  the  agreed  upon  criteria  and  guidelines \nestablished by the Project. Benefit monitoring through the enrollment projection \nprogram will measure project results against the project goals.  \n(e)  Timely and sufficient provision of counterpart funds will be provided, including \nallocation of funding for the first year's civil works. \n \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION \n \n58.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of ADB \nand recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special \nDrawing Rights 56,411,000 to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Decentralized Elementary \nEducation Project (Sindh) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with an interest charge at the rate \nof 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, \nincluding a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in \naccordance with those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the Board. \n \n \nTadao Chino \nPresident \n \n29 August 2002  \n ", "  Appendix 1  21 \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \n  Performance Indicators/     \nDesign Summary  Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nI.

Social  sector  service  delivery  for  education  has  lagged  behind  targets  set  by  the \nGovernment for the past 10 years despite Social Action Program (SAP) policies to protect the \nlevel of social sector spending. Reasons for the poor performance include the global economic \ndownturn, political developments in the region and a lack of management capacity needed to \ncoordinate change. The Government of Sindh recognizes that a strong elementary school \nsystem  serving  the  majority  of  students  is  essential  to  raise  the  prospects  for  economic \ndevelopment, social mobility, education, and job opportunities to reduce poverty. For Sindh, \npublic provision of educational services is essential to ensure an important public good, ensure \nequity across all the districts and correct market failures where the private education sector \nsiphons off those with ability to pay. Sindh Province is especially at risk of not employing basic \neducation to reduce poverty especially outside Karachi, where 65% of the 30 million Sindh \npopulation reside in underserved rural areas. Decentralization of public services is viewed as \none way to help ensure that decisions are taken closest to those who benefit from education\u2014\ndecisions that lead to long-term poverty reduction in communities (Figure A3.1). \n \n2.  The Sindh education system caters to 6.0 million children aged 5-10 (primary) and \nanother  2.0  million  aged  11-13  (middle)  for  a  total  cohort  of  8  million  elementary  school \nstudents. At present about 65% of the primary school age cohort attend school while 38% of the \nmiddle school age group are enrolled. There is a small but high quality private elementary \neducation system operating in urban areas, especially in Karachi, that serves the middle and \nupper classes. The private system caters to the upper 50% of income families and charges fees \nthree to four times the amount charged to public school students. In contrast, the public school \nsystem is large but inefficiently organized and ineffectively operated. It serves rural areas where \nthe population of school-going children is poor and scattered. Given the cultural impediments of \nmeeting the needs of female students who are unable to travel long distances from home to \nschool, girls\u2019 education is especially underserved by the public school system. According to the \nPakistan Household Survey, between 1997 and 1999 the Asian Crisis impacted on the gap \nbetween the urban and rural in terms of elementary school participation rates, with a lesser \nproportion of children from the lowest income households going to school as compared with \nprevious years. However, while boys dropped out of school due to economic hardship, girls' \nenrollments actually grew. \n \n3.  The result of this two-tier elementary education system in Sindh is a private sector \nschool system that attracts one in three parents who can afford to send children to schools \npossessing adequate facilities, staff and budgets. The public school system caters to two in \nthree parents from the bottom 50% of the household income and those living in rural areas. The \nschools often lack facilities, staff, and adequate budgets, and students still must pay fees that \ncan amount to $30 each year for books, uniforms, and incidentals, which is often prohibitive. \nSindh wants to develop a rationalized system of elementary schools for classes1-8 throughout \nthe province that will serve both rural and urban areas and will complement the private sector \nsystem. Until a majority of the young are in school through class 8, exposure to new ideas and \nways of doing things will not take root (Table A3.1). \n \n4.  Based on enrollment projections, the Provincial Education Department estimates that an \nadditional 250,000 students\u2014two thirds of them girls\u2014will complete class 5 in the coming 10 \nyears but will not be able to attend class 6 due to a shortage of available elementary schools in \nlocal communities. This number includes potential students who could be pulled into class 6 and \nbeyond through upgrading primary schools to elementary schools. Along similar lines, estimates \nsuggest that the internal efficiency of class 1-5 could be improved by 10% over the next 5 years \nto increase the number of class 5 public school leavers by 200,000, thereby contributing to the ", "     \n28  Appendix 3 \nnumber of class 6 enrollees. If Sindh is to increase its gross elementary school enrollments, it \nmust  act  to  increase  the  number  of  class  5  graduates  through  dropout  reduction  while \nsimultaneously increasing the availability of class 6-8 places, especially for girls in schools close \nto home.

Reasons why education lags in rural Sindh are several. First, there has not been a \nconcerted effort to map school enrollments, school locations and staff deployment throughout \nthe  province.  The  educational  management  information  system  developed  under  the  SAP \nlacked the sophistication needed to collect statistics annually, and political interference from \nprovincial politicians affected teacher assignments, which was not picked up in the surveys. \nSecond,  teacher  deployment  was  not  accurately  reflected  in  data  collection  and,  more \nimportantly, decisions on teacher assignment were not taken at the local level. Consequently, \ncommunities had no control over teacher assignment or performance. Third, incentive systems \nfor both teachers and communities did not exist and so communities lacked the ability to reward \nteacher performance and encourage parents to send their children to school regularly.  \n \n6.  Recognizing these failures, the Provincial Education Department has embarked on a \nprogram to map the existing 2,000 class 1-8 elementary schools to note location, coverage or \ncatchment area, enrollments, and staff resources. Planning for expansion of schools with full \nclasses  1-8  will  allow  unserved  communities  to  request  on  a  needs  basis  for  upgraded \nelementary schools. Efforts are under way to strengthen the local community through support \nfor existing School Management Committees to make them important stakeholders in ensuring \nthat schools function efficiently. The link between parents and community with local schools will \nbe  critical  to  effective  networking  of  elementary  schools  in  Sindh  and  will  help  ensure \ncommunity involvement to take decisions based on need to improve schools. For example, \nteacher attendance will be monitored by the staff management committee and reported to the \nunion council. Further, deployment of new teachers will be made at the district and local levels \nand not at the provincial offices (Table A3.3). \n \n7.  The  Government  of  Sindh  views  poverty  reduction,  especially  among  the  rural \npopulation, as the key to boosting economic development outside of Karachi. Education plays \nan important role to create the social capital needed by the poor to reach their maximum \npotential. Sindh's poverty framework includes physical asset creation including access to credit, \nsocial asset creation including education and nutrition, social safety nets and good governance \nincluding devolution of power, civil service reforms, and access to justice. Education\u2019s role in \nreducing poverty stems from providing opportunities for social and job mobility. Until a majority \nof the young are exposed to new ideas through schooling, it is unlikely that the population will \nhave the skills and knowledge to escape poverty (Table A3.4).

Project Beneficiaries (Social) \n \n1.  The elementary school system in Sindh Province is divided into two parts: the private \nsector, which is well funded and well staffed, and serves the middle class urban sector; and the \npublic school system, which is underfunded and staffed, and serves essentially rural and small \ntowns. The Project will address only the public sector. The private sector elementary school \nsystem consists of about 1,500 schools, 18,000 teachers, and 250,000 students. The schools \nare part of larger campuses of class 1-12 schools; 80% of their students come from the top two \neconomic quintiles based on household surveys; and 65% live in metropolitan Karachi. The \naverage cost of class 6-8 education in these schools is $100 per year. By contrast, the public \nelementary school system contains 2,000 schools, 9,000 teachers, and 550,000 students. The \ntypical school is small, located in one of the 16 rural districts, and caters to families from the \nbottom three economic quintiles (Table A12.1). The average cost of class 6-8 education in these \nschools is $30 per year. \n \nTable A12.1: Education Statistics for Sindh \n \n  Urban Areas     Rural Areas \nIncome Group  Male  Female  Both    Male  Female  Both \nA.
