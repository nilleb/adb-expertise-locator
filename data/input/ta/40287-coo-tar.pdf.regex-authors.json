In 2007, the Government of the Cook Islands adopted the Preventive Infrastructure Master \nPlan,1 an integral part of the National Sustainable Development Plan 2007\u20132010 (NSDP).2 The \nmaster plan supports achievement of two of the eight strategic goals of the development plan: (i) an \ninnovative and well-managed private sector-led economy; and (ii) strengthened and affordable basic \ninfrastructure, transport, and utilities to support national development. The master plan identifies \ninfrastructure that will need to be developed during the next 20 years; it will require investment of \nUS$175 million. The Government asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide project \npreparatory technical assistance (PPTA) to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management to \nprepare an infrastructure development project.  \n2.  ADB approved the PPTA concept paper in April 2007; the PPTA has been proposed for \nfunding from the Japan Special Fund. The Government of New Zealand will cofinance institutional \nreview and capacity development under an integrated approach. The ADB Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited the Cook Islands in March 2007 and reached understandings with the Government on the \nimpact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost  estimates  and  financing \narrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  of  the  PPTA. 3   The  Country  Partnership  Strategy \nPreprogramming Mission in April 2007 reached an agreement to include the PPTA in the Country \nOperations Business Plan 2007\u20132009. The country partnership strategy, currently being formulated \nfor  2008\u20132012,  will  include  the  PPTA  and  the  ensuing  loan  for  the  proposed  Infrastructure \nDevelopment  Project  for  approval  in  2009.  A  project  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The Cook Islands comprises 15 isolated islands and atolls with a total land area of 244 \nsquare kilometers (km2) dispersed over an exclusive economic zone of 1.8 million km2 of the Pacific \nOcean. The total population is approximately 20,300, with 70% living on the islands of Rarotonga \nand Aitutaki. The economy is narrowly based with high dependency on tourism, which accounted for \n50% of gross domestic product in FY2007. Economic growth, since the economic reform program in \n1996, has been led by the private sector, particularly by tourism-related commerce, and especially \non the most accessible islands of Rarotonga and Aitutaki. Over time, the basic infrastructure has \nbecome stressed with consequent risks to the environment. The Preventive Infrastructure Master \nPlan concludes that lack of investment in maintenance, rehabilitation, and upgrading has resulted in \naging systems that do not provide appropriate service for current demand to support sustained \ngrowth.  The  current  condition  of  infrastructure  places  gains  achieved  in  health  and  hygiene \nstandards at risk, not only for the resident population, but also for visitors. Water supply is not \npotable and no storage capacity exists to cater for periods of drought. Deteriorated reticulation \nsystems that have insufficient capacity are in urgent need of replacement. Sewerage relies on \nindividual septic tank systems that are suspected of contributing to lagoon pollution, again placing \nthe country\u2019s mainstay industry\u2014tourism\u2014at risk. In addition, efficient and reliable energy supplies \nare needed to ensure private sector investment, competitiveness, and efficiency.  \n4.  Development in the outer islands is constrained by low and declining populations. The \npopulation of some islands has declined by more than 35% since the mid-1990s. Outer island \nresidents have sought better employment opportunities and services in Rarotonga and New Zealand. \nBasic  service  provision  in  these  islands  is  constrained  by  isolation  and  high  transport  costs. \nInfrastructure services such as water and sanitation are provided on the outer islands with the \nsupport of Government grant transfers and development partner assistance. \n                                                 \n1  MPC  Group  International.  2006.

National Sustainable Development Plan (2007\u20132010). Rarotonga. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 27 April 2007. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  In  the  early  to  mid-1990s,  ADB  funded  a  PPTA  for  integrated  urban  infrastructure  in \nRarotonga.4 Because of the economic and financial crisis in 1996, ADB deferred implementation of \ninfrastructure  investments  and  refocused  assistance  on economic  and  fiscal  reforms.  In  1998, \nanother PPTA on urban infrastructure was approved5 to assist the Government in commercializing \nand  encouraging  private  sector  participation  in  urban  services  like  water  supply,  solid  waste \nmanagement, and sewerage system construction. This PPTA delivered feasibility studies for waste \nmanagement, water supply, and sewerage projects. The two PPTAs identified deficiencies in urban \nwater supply and waste management as threats to the health of Cook Islanders, as well as to the \ngrowing tourism industry. Subsequently, in 2001 ADB approved a US$2.2 million loan for waste \nmanagement.6 This project has constructed engineered landfills in Rarotonga and Aitutaki with the \nproject completion report7 rating the project \u201csuccessful.\u201d \n6.  The 2003 Legal and Institutional Strengthening of Environmental Management8 technical \nassistance  complemented  the  Environment  Act  (2003)  and  comprehensive  legislation  for \nsustainable protection, conservation, and management of the environment by establishing effective \ninstitutions  and  bylaws  for  environmental  management.  An  integrated  approach  to  sustainable \ninfrastructure requires effective enforcement of the environmental regulations. \n7.  The  2005  cyclones  highlighted  the  environmental  vulnerability  of  economic  and  social \ninfrastructure. The Cook Islands suffers from extreme climate events, such as tropical cyclones, \nintense periods of rainfall or drought, high winds, sea surges, and high air temperatures, which have \na significant impact upon the physical infrastructure. Global climate scenarios forecast increased \nfrequency and intensity of extreme climatic events that have the potential to perpetuate the cycle of \ndamage  and  consequent  setbacks  to  development  and  economic  growth.  The  Government \nacknowledges a need for a long-term national climate change adaptation strategy, including for \ninfrastructure, to address climate change vulnerabilities through climate-proofing infrastructure to \nreduce the repeated impact of weather events on infrastructure and the Government\u2019s scarce \nresources. \n8.  Environmentally sustainable economic growth, employment creation, and improvement of \nthe delivery of basic services hinge on infrastructure upgrading, particularly power, water, and \nsanitation services on the two main islands. Basic service delivery on the outer-islands has relied on \nthe Government\u2019s grant transfers to outer island administrations and bilateral grant assistance, \nparticularly from New Zealand. The volume of the Government\u2019s grant transfers depends on fiscal \nrevenues generated primarily from sustained growth of the tourism industry on Rarotonga and \nAitutaki.  \n9.  Since 1999, the Government\u2019s fiscal surpluses have enabled accumulation of reserves and \nrepayment of much past debt in 2006 from these reserves. Currently public debt is 8% of gross \ndomestic product. Fiscal surpluses, however, were achieved through a tight fiscal stance with \ninsufficient  investment  in  physical  infrastructure  and  its  maintenance,  with  a  consequent \naccumulated backlog of works. The improved financial position enables the Government to finance \nprioritized infrastructure improvements.  \n \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 1994.

In addition to the physical upgrading and rehabilitation needs, the Preventive Infrastructure \nMaster  Plan  acknowledges  that  the  infrastructure  sectors  suffer  from  institutional  capacity \nconstraints that impact on operations, cost recovery, and consequently on the regularity and quality \nof basic infrastructure service delivery. Institutional arrangements are fragmented, overlapping, and \nlack  coordination  resulting  in  ineffective  management  and  lack  of  clear  ownership  of  policies, \nplanning, and regulatory responsibility.  \n(i)  Water and sanitation. Under existing legislation, three government agencies share \nthe major responsibilities for water, sanitation, and solid waste on Rarotonga and \nAitutaki: Ministry of Works, Ministry of Health, and National Environment Service. In \nthe outer islands, the Office of the Minister of Island Administration provides these \nservices and relies on island administrations to implement projects and undertake \nmaintenance. \n(ii)  Energy.  In  the  energy  sector,  the  Energy  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Works  is \nresponsible for developing national energy policy and energy planning. It regulates \nand  monitors  standards  for  safety,  quality,  quantity,  and  efficiency  of  electricity \ngeneration  and  transmission;  as  well  as  for  setting  tariffs.  The  Cook  Islands \nInvestment Corporation, a holding company for state-owned enterprises, oversees \noperations of Te Aponga Uria, which operates power supplies on Rarotonga, and \nAitutaki Power Supplies on Aitutaki. Te Aponga Uria has developed an investment \nplan  to  improve  capacity  and  efficiency  over  the  next  15  years  at  a  cost  of \napproximately  US$50  million.  On  the  outer  islands,  the  island  authorities  are \nresponsible for their own power needs assisted by grants channeled through the \nOffice of the Minister of Island Administration. \n(iii)  Transport. Airstrips in the outer islands are operated by the island administrations \nlicensed by the Cook Islands Airports Authority. The Cook Islands Ports Authority has \nresponsibility for the harbors in Rarotonga and Aitutaki with the Office of the Minister \nof Island Administration responsible for outer-island facilities. Vital to development \nand  social  well-being  of  the  islands,  air  services  are  dependent  on  interisland \nshipping for aviation fuel in the outer islands. At present, the Government does not \nhave  an  air  and  marine  transport  policy  to  define  national  objectives  or  sector \nstrategies. The outer islands depend on private sector air and shipping services that \ndo not receive financial assistance from the Government. \n11.  Effective  implementation  of  the  Preventive  Infrastructure  Master  Plan  and  the  ensuing \nInfrastructure Development Project, results-focused service delivery, and asset management require \na  comprehensive  review  and  preparation  of  an  infrastructure  governance  framework,  involving \ninstitutional arrangements and capacity development, policies, and cost recovery and procedures. \nThe  Government  aims  to  identify  a  broad  infrastructure  governance  framework  for  vetting \ninfrastructure  proposals  and  optimizing  asset  management,  cost  recovery  possibilities,  asset \nperformance,  and  private  sector  participation.  This  involves  reviewing  appropriate  institutional \nstructures and performance monitoring arrangements, as well as performance targets. The PPTA \nwill  review  infrastructure  governance  to  achieve  effective  infrastructure  service  delivery  in  the \ncontext of the two municipality-sized service areas of Rarotonga and Aitutaki, and in the outer \nislands.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  PPTA  impact  will  be  a  contribution  to  environmentally  sound  development  of \ninfrastructure  for  power,  water  supply,  sanitation,  solid  waste,  and  transport  that  will  support \nsustained growth and development, and a sustainable basis for greater resource generation for the \nGovernment\u2019s pro-poor objectives. The PPTA outcome will be an agreed plan for strengthening the \n ", "4   \ninfrastructure  governance  framework  countrywide  and  capacity  development  of  Cook  Islands\u2019 \nimplementing agencies, and a detailed project proposal for priority funding by development partners \nand the Government. The TA outputs will be (i) a recommendation for an infrastructure governance \nframework  that  enables  the  Government  to  optimize  the  contribution  of  infrastructure  to \nenvironmentally  sustainable  growth  and  improve  basic  service  delivery,  involving  a  review  of \ninstitutional  arrangements  and  capacities,  policies  including  cost  recovery,  and  procedures;  \n(ii) public awareness building for changed institutional arrangements; and (iii) detailed feasibility \nstudy  for  priority  infrastructure  investments  with  technical,  financial,  economic,  environmental, \nsocial, and poverty assessments in accordance with ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines; and covering the \nfirst phase of the 20-year Preventive Infrastructure Master Plan. The initial poverty and social \nanalysis is in Appendix 2. The PPTA will prepare a financing plan including financing resources from \nADB (for economically viable project components), the Government, and development partners \nparticipating in the infrastructure sector. Total project funding is expected to be about US$40 million, \nwith indicative financing from ADB of US$20.1 million. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.   The PPTA will incorporate climate proofing in project design through a risk-based approach \nto  reduce  climate-related  risks  in  a  cost-effective  manner.  It  will  be  implemented  in  a  highly \nconsultative environment, including with the Government of New Zealand and the European Union \nas the main development partners in the sector, and will support the Government with stakeholder \nconsultations to identify and mitigate any potential risks to project implementation. The PPTA will \ninclude  assessments  of  the  safeguard  requirements  of  ADB  for  environmental,  social,  and \nresettlement  aspects  of  the  proposed  Project,  and  undertake  the  necessary  field  surveys  and \nconsultations with people affected and project beneficiaries. The PPTA will prepare action-based \nroad maps for implementing recommendations under the infrastructure governance framework, \ncovering policies, performance monitoring mechanisms with initial and target indicators, results-\nbased  service  delivery,  and  programs  to  upgrade  institutions  with  appropriate  management \ncapabilities. The PPTA will prepare targeted technical assistance in connection with the project loan, \nincluding support for implementation of the Project, reforms and institutional rationalization, and \ndevelopment of a comprehensive service delivery policy. Based on the Preventive Infrastructure \nMaster  Plan,  the  PPTA  will  prepare  a  detailed  feasibility  study  for  the  priority  infrastructure \nimprovements.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the PPTA is US$825,000 equivalent. The Government asked ADB to \nfinance US$500,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded \nby  the  Government  of  Japan.  The  Government  of  New  Zealand  will  cofinance  US$200,000 \nequivalent,  on  a  grant  basis,  to  be  administered  by  ADB.  The  Government  will  contribute \nUS$125,000 in kind through the provision of counterpart staff, office space, administrative support, \nand local transport and logistics. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Ministry of Finance and Economic Management, the Executing Agency for the PPTA, \nhas established the Aid and Capital Coordinating Committee, chaired by the secretary of foreign \naffairs and immigration, and comprising the financial secretary; chief of staff of the Office of the \nPrime Minister; public service commissioner; chief executive officer of the Ministry of Outer Islands \nAdministration; and two members of Parliament\u2014one from the Government and one representing \nthe opposition. A subcommittee of the coordinating committee, to be chaired by the chief of staff, will \nbe established in the Office of the Prime Minister to serve as the steering committee for the PPTA. \nThe Government will appoint counterpart staff to the steering committee from agencies managing \n ", "  5\ninfrastructure services. The PPTA will be implemented during 7 months, tentatively from April 2008 \nto  November  2008,  commencing  with  preparation  of  an  inception  report  within  4  weeks  of \ncommencement.  The  midterm  report  will  be  prepared  after  4  months  of  services  and  provide \ndetailed documentation for all project components with sufficient information for an ADB report and \nrecommendation of the President for proposed ADB assistance and for consideration for financing \nby other development partners. The draft final report will be submitted 1 month prior to the final \nreport. Reports will be circulated widely to country authorities and development partners.  \n16.  Consulting services with a total 23 international and 12 national person-months of inputs will \nbe provided by an international consulting firm with expertise in (i) infrastructure governance, and \ninstitutional and policy reviews; (ii) preparation of feasibility studies and design of power, transport, \nwater, and sewerage projects; and (iii) application of safeguards in environment, resettlement, and \nsocial impact areas. ADB will engage an international firm to implement the PPTA, using quality- \nand cost-based selection in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended  from  time  to  time).  The  quality\u2013cost  weighting  ratio  will  be  80:20.  ADB\u2019s  simplified \ntechnical  proposal  procedure  will  be  used.  National  consultants  will  provide  support  in  the \napplication of safeguards and particularly for local consultations and surveys. The consultant team \nwill  include  a  team  leader  with  expertise  in  infrastructure  economics,  institutional  reform,  and \ncapacity  building  (7.0  person-months);  institutional  specialist  (2.5  person-months);  financial \nmanagement  specialist  (1.0  person-month),  environmental  specialist  (1.5  person-months), \nresettlement  specialist  (1.5  person-months),  social  impact  specialist  (1.5  person-months),  and \nparticipation specialist (2.0 person-months); and engineers with expertise in the design and cost \nestimation  of  projects in  the  selected  subsectors  (6  person-months).  National  consultants  with \nexpertise in environmental, resettlement, and social issues will be engaged for a total of 12 person-\nmonths. The outline terms of reference for consultant\u2019s services are in Appendix 4. \n17.  The Government has agreed to provide the following: (i) furnished office accommodation; (ii) \naccess to all relevant documents, data, reports, and information that may be required to enable \nachievement of the PPTA objectives; (iii) assistance to the consultants in arranging meetings, travel, \nand discussions; (iv) arrangements for stakeholder meetings; and (v) counterpart staff to assist the \nconsultants. \n18.  The  consultants\u2019  reporting  requirements  include  an  inception  report;  midterm  report, \nincluding a resettlement plan, initial environmental examination, and summary initial environmental \nexamination; draft final report; and final report. The inception, midterm, and draft final reports will be \nreviewed in tripartite meetings between the Government, ADB, participating development partners, \nand the consultant. ADB\u2019s public communications policies will be followed to disclose reports once \nthey are finalized. Where resettlement plans and environmental assessments are prepared, they will \nbe disclosed to those affected in a form and language that they can understand.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of US$200,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of New Zealand; and (ii) ADB providing the balance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of US$500,000 on a grant basis, to the Government of the Cook \nIslands for preparing the Infrastructure Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n    Data Sources/   \nDesign  Performance  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nA contribution to  Infrastructure built  Government statistics  \u2022  Project design \nenvironmentally sound  incorporating climate    including institutional \ninfrastructure and  adaptation  Project reports  reforms and capacity \nimproved delivery of      building \ninfrastructure services to  Improved reliability and  Government budget  implemented \nachieve sustainable  efficiency of infrastructure    effectively \neconomic growth  services    \u2022  Timely provision of \n    project financing \nMaintenance adequately  requirements \nfunded  including ADB loan \n  Risks \n  \u2022  External factors \naffect tourism  \n\u2022  Damage to \ninfrastructure by \nextreme climatic \nevent \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nProject design agreed to  Draft final report submitted to  Project performance  \u2022  Priorities for public \nby the Government, ADB,  Government, ADB, and other  monitoring system  sector infrastructure \nand collaborating  agencies by September 2008    do not change \ndevelopment partners    Project reports  \u2022  Project components \n  Memorandum of    supported by \n  understanding agreed to by  Review missions  development \nADB and the Government for  partners \nfurther processing of the loan   Risks \nand associated technical  \u2022  Government plans to \nassistance by October 2008  implement significant \n  infrastructure not \n  envisaged by the \n  Preventive \nInfrastructure Master \nPlan and the \nNational Sustainable \nDevelopment Plan \n\u2022  Government \nassumes new \nborrowing for other \npurposes limiting its \ncapacity to finance \npriority infrastructure \n\u2022  Government \nprovides insufficient \nresources for \ninfrastructure \nmaintenance \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1  7\n    Data Sources/   \nDesign  Performance  Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy and the sector analysis describe how the \nproject would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction strategy of the \npartner country. \nInfrastructure contributes both directly and indirectly to the reduction of disadvantage and poverty in the Cook Islands. \nAbsolute poverty does not exist due to the Government\u2019s social welfare system. This is supplemented by access to land and \nthe seas for subsistence farming and fishing, especially in the outer islands. However, maintenance of the welfare system is \nheavily dependent upon affordability, which requires sustainable generation of Government revenue. Sound infrastructure is \nneeded to provide an environment in which the private sector can thrive. Development on the outer islands is constrained by \nisolation and distance from the main centers, as well as by small populations numbering only several hundreds. Development \nof infrastructure is unlikely to promote significant private sector activity in these locations in the short term as a direct means of \nreducing the disadvantage of these groups, but the project preparatory TA will identify basic infrastructure needs to reduce \ndisadvantage. However, economic growth must be maintained in the main centers so that provision of social services and \nmaintenance of infrastructure is affordable for all parts of the Cook Islands. \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, etc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \nThe PPTA will identify priority infrastructure projects across all islands in the Cook Islands. Project for ADB assistance will be \nidentified based on sustained contribution to economic growth but other projects for bilateral financing will be identified based \non needs and social considerations. Poverty analysis will be carried out to develop pro-poor or pro-disadvantaged design, and \nto quantify how the Infrastructure Development Project will reduce disadvantage and incorporate other social dimensions \nwithin the scope of project implementation. The analysis will be conducted following the guidelines in ADB\u2019s Handbook on \nPoverty and Social Analysis (2001). \n  \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? \nA total of 3.5 person months have been allocated for international social impact and participation specialists and domestic \nconsultants with expertise in environment, resettlement and social issues will be engaged for a total of 12 person-months. In \naddition, a special budget line has been allocated with $20,000 for stakeholder meetings. \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from the \nproject? \nWith water and sanitation as a high priority area on the main islands, the population at large as well as tourists will be the \nprimary beneficiaries. Aging water pipes and frequent disruptions in supply coupled with leaking septic tanks have caused \nincreasing health hazards for everybody. Safe water and sanitation is not only a requirement to underpin the tourist industry \nand thus provide the revenue which supports the financing of basic service delivery in the outer islands, but is also a basic \nneed for all inhabitants.  \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \nTo maintain the proper standard of water and sanitation supply, tariffs must be introduced to avoid the systems falling into \ndisrepair. There will be a need to introduce the so called \u201clifeline tariffs\u201d for the poorest segment of the society. \n ", "  Appendix 2  9\n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project address \n them? \nThere will be no constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services as the priority infrastructure projects will be \ndesigned to cover whole islands. For bilateral grant assistance to the outer islands, it is always the poorest segments of the \npopulations there that are targeted. \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.
