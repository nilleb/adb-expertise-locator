INTRODUCTION \n1.  In  2002,  the  Private  Infrastructure  Development  Group  (PIDG)  was  formed  by  four \nbilateral development agencies.1 Its mission is to mobilize private investment in infrastructure to \nspur economic growth and to reduce poverty.2 To fulfill this mission, PIDG established and \ninvested in several facilities for project development and financing to work exclusively in low-\nincome countries.3 PIDG also developed partnerships with affiliated programs, including the \nGlobal Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA), Infrastructure Development Collaboration \nPartnership  Fund  (DevCo)  of  the  International  Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  and  \nPublic\u2013Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF). Through these facilities and partnerships, \nPIDG has become an important platform for cooperation and knowledge sharing on scaling up \nprivate investment in infrastructure in low-income countries.  \n  \n2.  PIDG has requested that the Asian Development Bank (ADB) help strengthen PIDG\u2019s \ncapabilities and cooperation in Asia and the Pacific. This research and development technical \nassistance (TA),  through  a  contribution  to  PIDG's  Technical  Assistance  Facility  (TAF),  will \ndevelop knowledge to address barriers to private investment in infrastructure in low-income \ncountries in the region. Partnering with PIDG will not only be a cost-effective way to support \ndevelopment activities (thereby benefiting from additional resources of PIDG) but will also allow \nADB to gain relevant knowledge. The concept paper for this TA was approved on 3 April 2009 \nby the vice-president for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development.4 The design \nand monitoring framework is set out in Appendix 1.  \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.    ADB estimates that investment in infrastructure must reach an estimated $4.7 trillion \nover the next 10 years to sustain growth in the region.5 Therefore, countries in the region will \nneed to spend an estimated 6%\u20137% of their gross domestic products on infrastructure. However, \ntheir  recent  public  sector  investment  has  averaged  only  3%\u20134%  of  their  gross  domestic \nproducts, leaving a significant financing shortfall. Thus, support is needed to create the right \naccess and incentives for private investment in infrastructure. \n \n4.    The private sector is reluctant to allocate scarce project development funds and capital \nto projects in many low-income countries due to the high-risk nature of early-stage infrastructure \ndevelopment.  These  risks  arise  from  uncertainties  in  regulatory,  institutional,  and  political \nenvironments  and  include  currency,  credit,  and  market  risks.  Other  barriers  to  private \ninvestment in infrastructure involve (i) lack of suitable infrastructure projects for investment, (ii) \nhigh up-front costs of project development, (iii) shortage of long-term debt, (iv) lack of local \ncurrency funding, and (v) inadequate capacity in both public and private sectors. These barriers \nare set out in Appendix 2.  \n                                                 \n1  Initial members were the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom; Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs, Government of the Netherlands; Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency; and State \nSecretariat for Economic Affairs, Government of Switzerland. Austrian Development Agency, International Finance \nCorporation, Irish Aid, and World Bank have since joined.  \n2  \u201cInfrastructure\u201d  includes  energy  supply;  water  and  wastewater  services;  transport;  telecommunications;  gas \ntransport, distribution, and storage; urban infrastructure; mining infrastructure; and other infrastructure that directly \nimpacts the development of a country and promotes PIDG objectives. \n3  Defined according to the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) List of Overseas Development Assistance \nRecipients, as least\u2013developed countries (DAC I) and other low-income countries (DAC II). Projects in lower \nmiddle-income countries and territories (DAC III) are also supported. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 13 April 2009.  \n5  ADB. 2009. Investing in Sustainable Infrastructure: Improving Lives in Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n ", "2  \n \n5.  PIDG helps overcome such barriers through a range of specialized investment vehicles \nto  develop  and  finance  projects  in  low-income  countries,  including  ADB  DMCs.  These \ninvestment  vehicles  are  the  Emerging  Africa  Infrastructure  Fund;  GuarantCo  Limited;  and \nInfraCo Holdings Limited, which is a holding company for two regional companies, InfraCo Asia \nDevelopment Pte., Limited and InfraCo Africa Limited. PIDG's organizational structure and \noperational activities are provided in Appendix 3. The investment vehicles can develop projects \nthat are relatively small (i.e., less than $75 million) compared to those usually financed by ADB. \n \n6.  In low-income countries, the rigorous appraisal, selection, development, structuring, and \nimplementation  of  private  sector  participation  in  infrastructure  projects  require  specialized \ntechnical assistance and grants to build in-country public and private sector capacity. Toward \nthis goal, PIDG has established the TAF to assist the specialized investment vehicles and \naffiliated programs in developing and implementing such projects. The TAF has three windows \nof  funding:  (i)  general  technical  assistance  to  offer  guidance  on  financing  structure  and  \npost-transaction support, as well as targeted grants to enhance individual project development \nimpact  and  to  facilitate  infrastructure  services'  affordability  by  the  poor;  (ii)  capital  market \ndevelopment; and (iii) output-based aid subsidies. Further details on eligible activities funded \nthrough the TAF are in Appendix 3.  \n \n7.  As of 30 June 2008, PIDG's completed and ongoing projects were estimated to provide \n29.7 million additional people with new access to infrastructure services.6 It also contributed a \n$2.7 billion positive fiscal impact to low-income countries' governments through an estimated \n$1.5 billion in reduced subsidies and an estimated $1.2 billion in revenues through up-front \ngovernment fees.7 These infrastructure services included new or improved access to water, \nelectricity, transport, and cellular telephone connections, with an estimated 20% of people \nreceiving these services being below the poverty line. Additionally, projects are expected to lead \nto improved quality of infrastructure services for 46.8 million people, with 11% being below the \npoverty line. These projects are believed to have created 13,086 jobs in the short term from \nconstruction of infrastructure and are expected to create 200,000 jobs from operations in the \nlong term.   \n \n8.  The majority of PIDG-supported projects have been in Africa, which is a priority for many \ncurrent PIDG donors. However, PIDG desires to transfer its experience to Asia and the Pacific \nand  has  recently  increased  support  for  the  specialized  investment  vehicles  and  affiliated \nprograms operating in the region\u2014DevCo, GuarantCo, and InfraCo Asia\u2014and PIDG and ADB \nhave identified need for RDTA to support project development by these investment vehicles and \naffiliated programs.  \n \n9.  PIDG's mission resonates with ADB's aim to play a catalytic role in increasing private \nsector participation in infrastructure to reduce poverty and increase economic growth in the \nregion, as set out in Strategy 2020.8 Strategy 2020 also acknowledges that such private sector \nparticipation  will  be  harder  to  achieve  in  ADB's  low-income  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs) and that further experience and knowledge are needed. Due to the recent global \neconomic crisis, even greater effort will be required in the coming years to prepare infrastructure \nprojects and to develop risk mitigation instruments to attract private capital in these countries.  \n                                                 \n6  About 60% of these people are in Sub-Saharan Africa; about 30% are in East and South Asia; and the rest are in \nLatin America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Central Asia. \n7  PIDG. 2009.

PIDG operates in accordance with its constitution, which establishes its objectives and \nstrategy, how it is funded, how it operates, who can be a member, and member obligations and \nduties. PIDG functions through a governing council, PIDG Trust, a project management unit \n(PMU), and its investment vehicles and affiliated programs. Details of PIDG's organizational \nstructure and operational activities are provided in Appendix 3. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  main  impact  of  the  TA  will  be  increased  private  investment  in  sustainable \ninfrastructure in DMCs. The expected outcome will be the enhanced ability of public and private \nsectors to attract investment for infrastructure in DMCs and to maximize the development \nimpact of such investment. Activities supported by this TA will generate knowledge to leverage \nprivate sector infrastructure participation in DMCs, which will directly contribute to economic \ngrowth and poverty reduction.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.   The  TA  will  finance  studies,  reports  and  workshops  to  prepare  infrastructure \ndevelopment strategies, policy regulatory and institutional reforms, pioneering pilot transactions \nand capacity building. It will also finance studies, reports and workshops for improving the \nenabling securities market environment. \n \n13.  The assessment and monitoring of applications for ADB's contribution will be managed \nby a technical advisor9 according to the letter of arrangement between the PIDG Trust and ADB \nand  in  accordance  with  the  TAF  Statement  of  Policies  and  Procedures  (Supplementary \nAppendix C). Upon receipt of a proposal, the technical advisor will screen it to see whether it \nshould first be considered for funding by one of PIDG's affiliated programs.10 He or she will then \ndetermine whether the proposal meets the project investment criteria11 and ADB's eligibility \nrequirements as set out in the letter of arrangement, and score the proposal based on an \nevaluation system developed by the PMU.  \n \n14.  For eligible proposals (with a score of more than 80%),12 the technical advisor will work \nwith the relevant specialized investment vehicle or affiliated program to secure information \nnecessary for the PIDG governing council to review. Proposals with a value of more than \n$75,000 will be submitted for approval by the governing council on a no-objection basis of 10 \nworking days. Proposals with a value of $75,000 or less may be approved by the technical \nadvisor, and the governing council will be notified through the PMU. Details on the operating \nprocedures for the TAF and eligible activities are provided in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n9  The technical advisor is hired by the PIDG Trust, is  a member of the PMU,  and reports to the program manager. \n10 The focus of the PPIAF is to support development of the enabling environment for private participation in \ninfrastructure, such as technical assistance to develop the necessary legal, financial, and regulatory environment. \nThe PPIAF only provides transaction support on an exceptional basis to innovative projects. The GPOBA provides \noutput-based aid subsidies for increasing access to services by the poor in selected projects with demonstration \neffect. The TAF provides technical assistance primarily for transaction- or project-based activities, except for \nwindow 2, which may support stand-alone activities. Many donors to PIDG are also donors to these affiliated \nprograms and are keen to ensure clear demarcation between different funds. \n11 As set out in the Statement of Policies and Procedures and summarized in Appendix 3. \n12 Proposals scoring between 70% and 80% will be held on standby, and proposals below 70% will be rejected. The \ntechnical advisor will prepare quarterly reports detailing all proposals, as accepted, on standby and as rejected. \n ", "4  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The total cost of the TA is $1 million. It will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013IV), which will be disbursed in one installment to the \nPIDG Trust. The PIDG Trust will administer and account for the grant in accordance with the \nfinancial regulations and rules as well as procedures and practices of PIDG (including pooling of \nthe ADB grant with other funds received by TAF), and keep separate records and accounts for \nADB's contribution. The PIDG Trust will provide to ADB annual financial statements audited by \nits external auditors as well as certain other reports and documents.  \n \n16.  As long as ADB's contribution is $1 million, ADB will not be required to provide any \nadditional amount to PIDG for various fees and costs. However, in the event that interest earned \non the TAF's bank accounts are insufficient to pay the costs of the technical advisor\u2014and such \ncosts cannot be paid from any other source\u2014a prorated portion of such costs may be deducted \nfrom ADB's contribution (but not exceeding 1% of the contribution). If ADB makes a further \ncontribution to the PIDG Trust, but the total contribution remains below $10 million, ADB and the \nPIDG Trust will discuss in good faith ADB\u2019s payment of general PIDG administration costs. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a 24-month period, commencing on 31 December \n2009 and completed by 30 December 2011. Its closing date will be 30 June 2012 to allow time \nto  receive  audited  financial  statements  from  the  PIDG  Trust.13 ADB's  contribution  will  be \nprovided solely for funding the TAF and after signing of a letter of arrangement between the \nPIDG Trust and ADB.14  \n \n18.  Funds provided by PIDG members are placed in the PIDG Trust. Accordingly, the PIDG \nTrust is responsible for administration of the TAF under the direction of a project management \nunit (PMU), which will be the executing agency. A program manager, with support from a deputy \nprogram manager, currently manages the PMU\u2019s day-to-day operations in accordance with the \nPIDG constitution (Supplementary Appendix A) and handbook (Supplementary Appendix B). \n \n19.  DevCo, GuarantCo, and InfraCo Asia will be the implementing agencies (IAs). Following \napproval of project proposals, the PIDG Trust will enter into a funding agreement with the \nrelevant IA, which will reflect the requirements of the letter of arrangement, as appropriate. \nGrants will be made directly to the IA or, in case of post-transaction support, the PIDG Trust can \ndirectly pay invoices received from a service provider.   \n \n20.  In conjunction with projects being considered or developed by DevCo, GuarantCo, and \nInfraCo Asia, this TA will be restricted to (i) ADB's Group A and Group B DMCs,15 (ii) activities \nunder windows 1 and 2 of the TAF and (iii) consulting services.  \n \n21.  ADB will not become a PIDG member by virtue of this TA.16 However, it will be extended \nmany rights accorded only to PIDG members, including attendance at closed sessions of PIDG \n                                                 \n13 Audited financial statements are to be provided by the PIDG Trust no later than 180 days after the end of its \nfinancial year (currently January to December). \n14 No cost estimates, financing plans, or consultant terms of reference are necessary at this time. Investment vehicles \nand/or associated programs will develop proposals (which will include proposed activities, terms of reference for \nconsultants, financing plans, and proposed procurement arrangements) and submit these to the governing council \nand/or the technical advisor for review and assessment before funding is considered.  \n15 ADB. 2008.

ADB will also be included in the \ncirculation list to members of the governing council for approvals of, or no-objections to, all \ndecisions relating to projects funded by the TAF. ADB will not have the right to approve or object \nto any project; however, with respect to projects in ADB DMCs, ADB will be allowed to provide \ncomments and raise queries. In addition, ADB will be entitled, subject to certain restrictions such \nas  noted  below,  to  disseminate  within  ADB  information,  knowledge,  and  documentation \n(including outputs of consultants financed by this RDTA or otherwise) that ADB acquires as a \nresult  of  the  foregoing  arrangements,  although  ADB  will  restrict  circulation  of  information \npursuant to its attendance at closed-session meetings of PIDG. \n \n22.  Procurement will be managed by the PMU and IAs and carried out with due attention to \nconsiderations of economy and efficiency and in an open, transparent manner. Procurement \nprocedures where TAF funds are involved must be approved by the technical advisor. The \nprocurement  and  recruitment  of  consultants  will  be  undertaken,  with  respect  to  ADB's \ncontribution, using IFC/World Bank procurement procedures, with eligible bidders being only \nfirms and individuals from ADB member countries.  \n \n23.  This  TA  does  not  trigger  ADB  safeguard  requirements;  therefore,  use  of  ADB's \nsafeguard policies will not be mandatory. It is expected, however, that when ADB's contribution \nis used to prepare any documents relating to environmental and social safeguards, the PIDG \nTrust and PMU will ensure that these comply with national law and policies and IFC's safeguard \npolicies.17 \n \n24.  As part of the due diligence process, integrity checks were also performed, and no \nissues of concern were identified in relation to PIDG, the PMU, PIDG Trust, or its specialized \ninvestment vehicles.  \n \n25.  ADB will work closely with the technical advisor in monitoring the use of ADB funds and \noutputs of individual projects. The ADB project officer for this TA will disseminate information \nwithin ADB (subject to the restrictions contained in the letter of arrangement) as follows: (i) \nestablish a virtual group of staff members who will be kept informed of PIDG activities; (ii) share \nreports and outputs of activities with virtual groups and relevant country and/or sector staff; (iii) \nshare knowledge products and monitoring and evaluation reports from PIDG and the TAF with \nvirtual groups and relevant staff; (iv) facilitate meetings among ADB, DevCo, GuarantCo, and \nInfraCo Asia; and (v) share lessons and information through ADB workshops and communities \nof practice. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe  Technical  Assistance  Facility  of  the  Private  Infrastructure  Development  Group  for \nContribution  to  the  Technical  Assistance  Facility  of  the  Private  Infrastructure  Development \nGroup, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n                                                                                                                                                          \n16 Membership requires a $10 million equity contribution over a 3- to 4-year period plus payment of administrative \ncosts of the PIDG Trust and the project management unit, currently around $250,000 per year. \n17 ADB's environmental and social safeguard requirements are generally consistent with IFC's environmental and \nsocial safeguard requirements. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and/or \nDesign Summary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Risk \nIncreased investment  More than a 5%  PPIAF database   Economic and political \nby the private sector in  increase in investment  instability in participating \nsustainable  by the private sector in  DMCs \ninfrastructure in DMCs   infrastructure in DMCs   \nby December 2015  Assumption \nfrom more than $8.6  Policy and regulatory \nbillion in 2007   environment remains \nsupportive of private \ninfrastructure development in \nDMCs. \nOutcome      Assumption \nEnhanced public and  Increased number of  PMU report  Sustained public and private \nprivate sector ability to  innovative projects    sector interest in \nattract capital  involving the private  TAF report  participating in projects \ninvestments for  sector in DMCs by   \ninfrastructure in DMCs  December 2011  6-month business reports \nand to maximize   \ndevelopment impact  Three to four private \nsector-financed \ninfrastructure projects \nand one to two \nguarantees by \nDecember 2011 \nOutputs       \n1.

Scope of Institutional Capacity Assessment \n \n1.  This assessment is based on information obtained from meetings and missions with the \nPrivate Infrastructure Development Group (PIDG) governing council, program manager, deputy \nprogram manager, technical advisor of the Technical Assistance Facility (TAF), InfraCo Asia, \nDevCo, and GuarantCo. Key PIDG documents were also reviewed, including its constitution \n(Supplementary Appendix A), handbook (Supplementary Appendix B), and TAF Statement of \nPolicies and Procedures (Supplementary Appendix C).  \n \nB.  Introduction  \n \n2.  Because PIDG is not a legal entity, it performs many of its functions through the PIDG \nTrust, located in Mauritius. Mauritius was chosen as base due to its favorable trust law, tax law, \nand transparency.  \n \n3.  The PIDG Trust is administered by three trustees, including a principal trustee, SG \nHambros Trust Company Limited, United Kingdom. Using member contributions, the PIDG \nTrust  invests  in,  owns,  and  manages  the  following  investment  vehicles:  Emerging  Africa \nInfrastructure Fund (EAIF); GuarantCo Limited; and InfraCo Holdings Limited, which is a holding \ncompany for two regional companies, InfraCo Asia Development Pte., Limited and InfraCo \nAfrica Limited.  \n \n4.  PIDG has also established relationships with associated programs, including the Global \nPartnership  on  Output-Based  Aid  (GPOBA),  Infrastructure  Development  Collaboration \nPartnership Fund (DevCo) of the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and Public\u2013Private \nInfrastructure  Advisory  Facility  (PPIAF).  Each  investment  vehicle  and  affiliated  program \naddresses  a  particular  market  gap  in  various  infrastructure  sectors.  Their  activities  are \ncomplemented with targeted technical assistance or grants, provided through the TAF. The \nPIDG Trust has appointed a technical advisor to manage applications to the TAF according to \nthe TAF Statement of Policies and Procedures. The structure of PIDG is set out in Appendix 2. \n \n5.  PIDG investment vehicles and affiliated programs have helped finance 26 ongoing and \ncompleted projects for a total commitment (mainly in the form of loans and/or guarantees) of \n$493.7 million, as well as providing project development support to 70 projects for a total \nfunding cost of $61.7 million. These commitments by PIDG facilities have helped catalyze \ncommitments of $9 billion from private investors at the project level. PIDG donors had, as of 31 \nDecember 2008, paid $296.38 million (Table A3), generating a 1:30 ratio of donor investments \nto private sector investment commitments. About 82% of commitments have been for activities \nin Development Assistance Committee (DAC) I and II countries, and the remaining 18% in DAC \nIII countries. \n \n  \n   \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \n \nTable A3: Donor Contributions to the Private Infrastructure Development Group  \nas of 31 December 2008  \n($ million) \n \nInfraCo  InfraCo  Project \nItem  EAIF  GuarantCo  Africa  Asia  TAF  DevCo  Administration  Development  Totals \nDFID  60.00  25.00  12.50  8.86  5.53  34.76  0.93  1.78  149.36\nMOFA  10.00  25.00a  10.00  \u2013  -  4.15  0.79  0.12  50.06\nSida  20.00  15.00  \u2013  \u2013  1.00  3.23  0.79  0.12  40.14\nIFC \nand \nWorld \nBank  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  7.90  11.75  0.78  0.12  20.55 \nSECO  10.00  8.00  2.50  \u2013  1.00  \u2013  0.79  0.12  22.41\nADA  \u2013  \u2013  4.08  \u2013  2.95  2.11  0.43  \u2013  9.57\nIrish \nAid  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013  \u2013 4.11  \u2013  0.18  \u2013  4.29 \nTotal   100.00  73.00  29.08  8.86 22.49 56.00 4.69 2.26 296.38\nADA  =  Austrian  Development  Agency;  DevCo  =  Infrastructure  Development  Collaboration  Partnership  Fund, \nInternational Finance Corporation; DFID = Department for International Development of the United Kingdom; EAIF = \nEmerging Africa Infrastructure Fund; GPOBA = Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid; MOFA = Ministry of Foreign \nAffairs, Government of the Netherlands; PIDG = Private Infrastructure Development Group; PPIAF = Public\u2013Private \nInfrastructure Advisory Facility; SECO = State Secretariat for Economic Affairs, Government of Switzerland; Sida = \nSwedish International Development Cooperation Agency; TAF = Technical Assistance Facility. \na Payments made by the Dutch Development Bank, FMO, which hold shares in GuarantCo directly. \nSource: PIDG Annual Report 2008. \n \nB.  Governance Structure \n \n6.  PIDG operates in accordance with its constitution, which establishes its objectives and \nstrategy, how it is funded, how it operates, who can be a member, and member obligations and \nduties. PIDG functions through a governing council, PIDG Trust, a project management unit \n(PMU), and its investment vehicles and affiliated programs.  \n \n7.  The governing council is the decision-making body of PIDG, and each member entity \nappoints a representative. Each member has one vote, and all decisions must be unanimous \n(i.e., abstentions are not allowed). The governing council meets no less than twice a year, \nnormally in May and November. Each meeting is hosted by a member in rotation. The host will \nnormally chair that meeting and the governing council for 6 months, until the next meeting. The \nmeetings provide a forum for members to discuss existing and potential projects; to review \nperformance of investment vehicles, including their development impact; to identify links with \naffiliated  programs;  and  to  address  PIDG  administration.  Each  meeting  includes  a  closed \nsession  (for  members  only  and  the  PMU)  and  an  open  session  (for  observers  and \nrepresentatives from investment vehicles and affiliated programs). During the closed session, \nthe PMU reports on activities in the past 6 months and any decisions that need to be made by \nthe governing council. The open session is for reports from each facility on their progress and \nfuture plans, and for open discussion on matters of general interest.  \n \n8.  The governing council appoints a PMU for a period of up to 4 years to act as its \nadministrative arm. The PMU is recruited by open competition and consists of a program \nmanager, a deputy program manager, and support staff members. Currently, the PMU is CA \nLegal from the United Kingdom, and its contract was extended for another term in March 2009. \nThe  PMU  also  hires  development  advisors  to  support  its  activities  as  required.  The  PMU \nmanages arrangements among members, the PIDG Trust, projects, investment vehicles, and \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \naffiliated programs, and provides secretariat services to the governing council. Its terms of \nreference are attached to the PIDG handbook. The program manager has been delegated \nauthority to make individual payments of up to $75,000 from funds held by the PIDG Trust.  \n \n9.  The  PIDG  Trust  invests  in  investment  vehicles  and  enters  into  other  contractual \narrangements on behalf of PIDG. The PIDG Trust was established by a declaration of trust \ndated 1 December 2001 (amended and restated on 14 March 2003) in accordance with the laws \nof Mauritius. It was established to (i) facilitate provision of infrastructure needed to eliminate \npoverty in low-income countries by encouraging private investment; (ii) invest in accordance \nwith an investment plan adopted by trustees on the basis of proposals submitted by the PMU; \n(iii) exercise any rights of control and influence arising from its investments; (iv) invest, apply, or \nuse its funds for poverty reduction in low-income countries; and (v) administer and pay general \nPIDG administration and project development costs. \n \n10.  The PIDG Trust has three trustees\u2014Minimax Limited and Multiconsult Trustees Limited, \nbased in Mauritius, and SG Hambros Trust, based in the United Kingdom\u2014that act jointly for \nand on behalf of the PIDG Trust. The PIDG Trust is administered by the principal trustee, and is \ntherefore resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes. Any tax payable by the PIDG Trust is \npaid out of interest earned on funds held on its account. Under Mauritian law, the PIDG Trust is \nrequired to have an enforcer (currently the Department for International Development [DFID] of \nthe United Kingdom) to enforce provisions of the declaration of trust in consultation with PIDG \nand on advice of its legal advisors. The PIDG Trust also has a protector (currently CA Legal), \nwhile  not  a  legal  requirement  under  Mauritian  law,  ensures  that  the  PIDG  Trust  acts  in \naccordance with PIDG objectives. \n \n11.  A trust structure was chosen for a number of reasons. It maintained a certain level of \nflexibility for members, was straightforward to establish, and enables PIDG to operate in a \nnonbureaucratic manner. It was also favorable because some members are prohibited from \ninvesting directly in an investment company, and the alternative of creating an international \norganization required significantly more time and was likely to be more bureaucratic. Members \ndo not own the PIDG Trust or its investment vehicles; members provide grants or loans to the \nPIDG Trust for investment by the PIDG Trust in the investment vehicles. Formal legal ownership \nof investment vehicles is vested in the PIDG Trust (although ownership of affiliated programs \ndoes not rest with the PIDG Trust, but rather with the particular trust or body that has control of \ntheir funds). Members are accountable to their parliaments or shareholders for the oversight and \ncorrect use of funds that they allocate to the PIDG Trust as well as for other associated PIDG \ninvestments that do not go through the PIDG Trust, e.g., DevCo.  \n \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n12.  The role of the investment vehicles and affiliated programs is to help PIDG achieve its \naims of economic growth and poverty alleviation through private participation in infrastructure in \nlow-income countries. By the end of 2008, PIDG established five investment vehicles (InfraCo \n[the parent company for the two regional companies], InfraCo Africa, InfraCo Asia, EAIF, and \nGuarantCo) and one facility (TAF), and developed relationships with three affiliated programs \n(DevCo, GPOBA, and PPIAF).  \n \n13.  PIDG has ensured that each investment vehicle and facility has a set of operating \npolicies and procedures, and the PIDG Trust and PMU monitor their activities closely. These \npolicies  include  country  eligibility  restrictions;  environmental,  economic,  and  development \npolicies;  procurement  policies;  checklists  of  anticorruption  controls;  and  monitoring  and \n ", "Appendix 3  13 \nevaluation  frameworks.  The  facilities,  investment  vehicles,  and  affiliated  programs  are \nresponsible for carrying out their activities in line with PIDG objectives as set out in their \nrespective operating policies and guidelines. They are also responsible for (i) providing quarterly \nand  half-yearly  management  reports  to  the  PMU  for  circulation  to  PIDG  members,  (ii) \ncompleting anticorruption indicator checklists for their particular facility or investment vehicle, \nand (iii) completing a development indicators checklist and monitoring and evaluation framework \nfor each project. \n \n14.  Details on investment vehicles, affiliated programs, and facilities are provided below.  \n(i)  InfraCo  Asia.  An  investment  vehicle,  InfraCo  Asia  is  a  privately  managed \ninfrastructure  development  company  (with  an  affiliated  investment  fund)  that \nseeks to address the lack of projects that are suitable for private investment in \nlow-income countries. InfraCo Asia prepares projects with a total capital cost \nbelow $75 million, although larger projects are considered on a case-by-case \nbasis. It assumes risks and costs of early-stage project development in areas \nwhere  traditional  developers  would  not.  InfraCo  is  the  parent  company  and \noriginally operated across both Africa and Asia. It has developed one project in \nViet Nam and is developing two projects in Nepal and one in Indonesia, using \nconsultants  reporting  to  its  board  of  directors.  However,  InfraCo  has  now \nestablished separate companies, InfraCo Africa and InfraCo Asia. Procurement \nof an InfraCo Asia management team is underway, and a team is expected to be \nready  to  commence  operations  by  early  2010.  InfraCo  Asia  is  holding \ndiscussions with AusAID and Japan International Cooperation Agency on further \nequity investments to augment the contribution of DFID. \n(ii)   GuarantCo. An investment vehicle, GuarantCo offers partial guarantees on local \ncurrency private and public sector debt issued for infrastructure projects. These \nserve as credit enhancements to facilitate local debt markets, mitigating credit \nrisk for local lenders and investors. GuarantCo's key objectives are to encourage \ndomestic financing of infrastructure services and to promote local capital market \ndevelopment.  By  end  of  December  2008,  a  number  of  PIDG  donors  had \ncontributed $73 million in equity investments to GuarantCo. In March 2009, it \nsigned  an  agreement  for  a  leveraged  facility  from  German  development \ncooperation through KfW Bankengruppe and Barclays Bank, which provided an \ninitial increase in guarantee capacity to $200 million with flexibility up to $400 \nmillion (based on equity of $100 million). GuarantCo has moved out of Africa, \nsigned two guarantees in India, and plans to develop further activities in Asia and \nthe Pacific.  \n(iii)  DevCo. An affiliated program, DevCo is an untied, multidonor facility established \nby IFC and DFID to provide support to governments in preparing infrastructure \nprojects for private sector investment. It is funded through a designated trust fund \nwithin  IFC  rather  than  through  the  PIDG  Trust.  PIDG  donors  are  the  only \ncontributors to DevCo, and all DevCo projects are subject to the same approval \nprocesses as that of other PIDG facilities. By December 2008, PIDG donors had \ncontributed $56 million directly to DevCo. As of December 2008, DevCo had \nsupported 28 projects with a total cost of $25.45 million, of which 11 projects \nhave  closed.  DevCo  estimates  that  11  projects,  which  cost  $6.2  million  to \nprepare, leveraged $1.997 million of private  sector investment commitments. \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \nDevCo  has  successfully  closed  four  projects  in  Asia  and  has  eight  ongoing \nmandates in the region.1  \n \n15.  The TAF is a facility established by PIDG, which has the overall objective of enhancing \nthe ability of public and private sector clients to attract private capital to financing infrastructure \nand related services. The governing council oversees and defines the strategy of the TAF \naccording to its constitution and Statement of Policies and Procedures, and its strategy is set \nout in 3-year business plans. The TAF is administered by and housed within the PIDG Trust and \nis established to provide grants to help government, quasi-government, and private sector \nentities access investment vehicles and affiliated programs. The governing council reviews the \nportfolio of projects on the basis of reports prepared by a technical advisor, which comprise (i) \nannual monitoring and evaluation reports, including results of project site visits; (ii) reports on \nprogress and completion of projects support by TAF grants; and (iii) verbal feedback during \ngoverning council meetings. The PIDG Trust provides annual audited financial statements and \nother reports with respect to the TAF to PIDG. At any time, the governing council can request a \nreview  of  the  TAF\u2019s  operations,  cost  structure,  impact,  and  effectiveness.  The  operating \nprocedures of TAF are in Figure A3. \n \n16.  The TAF is managed by a technical advisor who is hired on a part-time basis by the \nPIDG Trust. He or she is a member of the PMU and reports to the program manager. The \ncurrent technical advisor is based in Washington, DC, and used to work for the World Bank \nGroup. TAF grants can only be awarded to PIDG investment vehicles and affiliated programs, \nwhich are then responsible for their management on behalf of PIDG. By the end of December \n2008, PIDG donors had contributed a total of $22.49 million to the TAF. By the end of 2008, the \nTAF had approved 47 activities across more than 20 countries, and committed funds totaling \n$15.9  million. 2 Its  remaining  balance  has  been  programmed  for  upcoming  activities  of \ninvestment vehicles and affiliated programs. \n \n17.  TAF  has  three  windows  of  funding.  Window  1  includes  studies  intended  to  guide \ngovernment and public or private agencies on options for financing infrastructure; advice and \ntraining  on  design  and  implementation  of  specific  reforms;  support  to  these  designs  and \nimplementation of pioneering transactions; as well as institutional strengthening, training, and \ncapacity building. It is also primary source of grants for post-transaction support and activities to \nenhance  development  effectiveness.  Window  2  supports  capital  market  development  in \ncountries in which GuarantCo is operating and is only available to GuarantCo. Window 3 \nprovides grants to address issues of balancing affordability by the poor with commercial viability \nby applying output-based aid principles. A summary of project investment criteria for windows 1 \nand 2 is provided below.  \n \n   \n                                                 \n1  The closed projects comprise three in the Philippines (all supporting the Small Power Utilities Group) and one in \nSamoa (supporting Polynesian Airlines). The ongoing mandates include those in Bhutan (air transport), India (two \non road transport and one on solid waste), Indonesia (power), Philippines (Manila light rail), Tajikistan (mining), and \nViet Nam (power).  \n2  Four activities were eventually canceled, and their savings were redirected toward other activities. \n ", "Appendix 3  15 \nFigure A3: Operating Procedures of the Technical Assistance Facility \nInvestment vehicle prepares \nTA proposal. \nTechnical advisor reviews proposal (including \nproposed procurement procedures) against TAF \ninvestment criteria and eligibility requirements. \nProposals over $75,000 \nTechnical advisor submits \nProposal under $75,000  proposal to governing council \n(with a summary report and \nrecommendation) for no \nobjection.\nAssuming no objection \nTechnical advisor  TA approved by \napproves  governing council \nor steering group. \nImplementation of TA by investment vehicle \nwith oversight by technical advisor \nMonitoring and evaluation by \ntechnical advisor \nTechnical advisor reports  PIDG Trust submits \nto governing council on  annual audited \nTAF activities.  statements to the \ngoverning council. \nGoverning council \nprovides strategic \nguidance for TAF \nmanagement to PMU \nand technical advisor.\n \nPIDG = Private Infrastructure Development Group, PMU = project management unit, TA= technical assistance, TAF = \nTechnical Assistance Facility. \nSource: TAF Statement of Procedures and Policies. \n \n18.
