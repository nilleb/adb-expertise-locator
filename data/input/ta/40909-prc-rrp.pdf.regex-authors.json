(HZCCB) in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nfor  approximately  5%  of  the  total  outstanding  shares,  as  an \nimportant step in reforming the PRC commercial banking sector \non the city level.  \n   \nClassification  Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector: Finance \nSubsectors: Banking systems \nThemes: Sustainable economic growth, Private sector \ndevelopment, and Capacity development. \nSubthemes: Private sector investment and Privatization \n   \nInvestee Company  HZCCB \n   \nEnvironment  The  investment  is  classified  in  the  category  of  \u201cfinancial \nAssessment  intermediaries\u201d and \u201cC\u201d for indigenous people and resettlement. \n   \nCosponsor  The investment is in conjunction with a strategic investment in \nHZCCB by cosponsor Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). \n   \nRationale and  An  efficient  financial  system  promotes  sustainable  economic \nJustification  growth,  which  generates  employment  and  reduces  poverty. \nFinancial intermediation, particularly through the banking sector, is \nthe  main  engine  for  economic  growth.  The  banking  sector \ndominates  the  financial  system  in  the  PRC.  However,  the \ninefficiency of the sector has been identified as one of the greatest \nobstacles to long-term growth, especially the limited access of \nsmall and medium-sized enterprises (SME) to financing.  \n \nRecognizing  the  need  to  improve  the  banking  sector,  the \nGovernment of the PRC has encouraged the reform of its banks, \nespecially  state-owned  commercial  banks  (SOCB).  For  certain \nqualified banks, the Government has promoted the involvement of \nprivate domestic and foreign strategic investors. The first stage of \nreforms targeted the \u201cbig four\u201d SOCBs. Now the focus of reforms \nis on the network of 112 city commercial banks (CCB) that serve \nmajor urban areas throughout the PRC. These CCBs play\u2014and \nwill continue to play\u2014a vital role in and around the cities they \nserve, especially in SME development. However, CCBs will have \nto  address  some  significant  issues  before  they  can  improve, \nincluding  strategic  risk,  poor  corporate  governance,  weak  risk \nmanagement, and low capital adequacy ratios.  \n \nThe success of PRC\u2019s banking reforms, SME development, and \neconomic growth hinges on the ability of PRC banks, especially \nthe CCBs, to address these challenges properly. The Government \nviews  the  introduction  of  experienced  and  qualified  overseas \nstrategic investors as an effective method to promote, as well as ", "ii   \nto  enhance,  this  reform  process.  However,  while  the  growth \nprospects  of  PRC\u2019s  banking  sector  are  attractive  to  investors, \ninternational banks remain wary of taking minority stakes even in \nrelatively higher-quality CCBs. Their main concerns are (i) the \nuntested  governance  framework;  (ii)  the  strategic  partner\u2019s \npotential  inability  as  minority  investor  to  influence  strategic \ndirection,  management,  and  equity  distributions;  and  (iii) \nuncertainty over the continued role of local government. \n   \nValue-Added  Through  this  investment,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB) \ndelivers  value  to  HZCCB  by  assisting  in  the  development  of \nadequate corporate governance and internal control procedures, \nas well as in opportunities for commercial cooperation. ADB also \nadds value to HZCCB\u2019s shareholders by fulfilling the role of an \n\u201chonest broker\u201d that has only the bank\u2019s best interests at heart. \n   \nDevelopment Impact  An  investment  in  HZCCB  would  impact  development  by  (i) \npromoting the development of a lagging financial sector, thereby \nincreasing access to finance for SMEs, in a showcase region with \nstrong  private  sector,  SME-driven  economic  development;  (ii) \nsupporting  the  transformation  of  a  leading  CCB,  especially  in \ncorporate  governance,  internal  control,  and  environmental \nsensibility, which would send a strong demonstration signal to \nother  CCBs  in  the  country;  (iii)  demonstrating  feasibility  and \nproviding  market  benchmarks  for  similar  investments  in  other \nCCBs, and helping to catalyze such investments; (iv) indirectly \nfostering  economic  development  of  non-coastal  regions  in  the \nPRC; and (iv) supporting the Government\u2019s efforts to restructure \nthe banking sector. \n   \n \n \n \n \n ", "  1\nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nequity investment of up to $30 million in CNY equivalent (or, if ADB is unable to fund in CNY, in \nUS dollars) for approximately 5% of the shares in Hangzhou City Commercial Bank, Co. Ltd \n(HZCCB), in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) (the Project). \n \nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \nA.  PRC Economic Development and Industry Background  \n1.  Overview of Latest Developments in the PRC Economy \n2.  In recent years, the PRC has made progress in restructuring its economy, especially by \nreducing its dependence on Government spending and increasing the performance of its state-\nowned enterprise (SOE) sector. On the surface, the PRC possesses a respectable credit profile \n(Standard & Poors: A-, Moody\u2019s: A2, Fitch: A-). The economy features rapid growth rates, high \nsavings and investment rates, low Government and external debt, and stable long-term capital \ninflows. Driven by buoyant domestic investment and exports, gross domestic product (GDP) \ngrowth has exceeded 9% for 4 straight years, including 9.9% in 2005. The PRC\u2019s key strength, \nhowever, lies in its strong external balance. The current account surplus is about three times the \ncountries external debt, while reserves cover its external debt three times and short-term debt \nfive times. The economic expansion continued in the first quarter of 2006, as real GDP grew \n10.2% compared with the same period in 2005\u2014much faster than the Government\u2019s full-year \nprojection of 8% growth. Investment and exports continued to propel growth in the first quarter. \nExports increased 26.6% year-on-year, helping to boost official foreign exchange reserves to \n$875 billion at the end of March from $819 billion 3 months earlier. Yet economic reforms, as \nwell as social and environmental issues, will continue to present challenges for the foreseeable \nfuture. An economic summary of the PRC is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises in the PRC: Driving Growth \n \n3.  Small and medium-sized enterprises (SME)1 play a significant role in the PRC economy, \ndriving employment, economic growth, and development. They account for almost half of GDP, \ntwo thirds of industrial value added, 60% of exports, and 40% of fiscal revenues.2 SMEs also \nprovide 75% of urban and rural employment. Private sector SMEs have grown faster than the \nlarger SOEs. In recent years, the industrial output of SMEs has been increasing at an annual \naverage  rate  of  30%,  compared  with  20%  for  industry  as  a  whole.3 Consequently,  the \ndevelopment of the SME sector is regarded as more than an important engine of growth. It is \nconsidered a key contributor to poverty reduction by generating jobs, individual income, and tax \nrevenues. \n \n4.  SMEs rely heavily on access to external capital to finance their operations. However, a \nsurvey by the State Information Center found that more than 80% of the PRC\u2019s SMEs have \ndifficulty accessing financial services and securing financing.4 Although bank loans in the PRC \n                                                 \n1  The Government of the PRC defines medium-sized industrial enterprises as those with a maximum of 2,000 \nemployees, CNY400 million in assets, and CNY300 million in sales. Small industrial enterprises are those with a \nmaximum of 300 employees, CNY40 million in assets, and CNY30 million in sales. \n2  ADB. 2003.

This lack of access to bank lending is considered the main financing difficulty and \nstumbling block to sustainable future growth of SMEs. (Appendix 1) \n \n3.  Overview of the PRC Financial System  \n5.  The banking sector plays a dominant role in the PRC\u2019s financial system. At the end of \nSeptember 2005, the PRC\u2019s commercial banking system comprised (i) four national state-\nowned commercial banks (SOCB), (ii) 13 national joint-stock commercial banks (JSCB), (iii) 112 \ncity commercial banks (CCB), (iv) 57 rural cooperative and commercial banks, (v) 626 urban \ncredit cooperatives, (vi) about 30,000 rural credit cooperatives, and (vii) 238 operational entities \nof foreign banks.5 The four SOCBs dominate the sector, together accounting for 54% of banking \nsector assets, followed by the JSCBs (15%), and the CCBs (5%) (Table 1; Appendix 2, Figure \nA2.1). Foreign banks account for less than 2% of market share. \n \nTable 1: PRC Banking Sector Statistics, End of March 2006 \nYear-on- Year-on- Year-\nAssets  year  Liabilities  year  Equity  on-year \n(CNY  % of  growth  (CNY  % of  growth  (CNY  % of  growth \nItem  billion)  total  (%)  billion)  total  (%)  billion)  total  (%) \nSOCBs  20,805  53.1  17.4 19,869 53.1 16.8 936       53.7   30.5\nJSCBs  6,075  15.5  26.9 5,846 15.6 26.7 229       13.1   33.9\nCCBs  2,089  5.3  25.3 2,005 5.4 24.7 84         4.8   42.4\nOther  10,224  26.1  17.5 9,730 25.9 16.6 494       28.3   36.8\nTOTAL  39,193  100  19.2 37,450 100 18.6 1,743     100   33.3\nCCB = city commercial banks, CNY = yuan, JSCB = joint-stock commercial banks, SOCB = State-owned commercial \nbanks. \nSources: China Banking Regulatory Commission, Asian Development Bank staff analysis. \n \n6.  In  the  PRC,  the  ratio  of  bank  assets  to  stock  market  capitalization  plus  bonds \noutstanding exceeds 300%, a far higher ratio than in most industrialized countries and even \nmany developing countries. For example, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, and the United \nStates have ratios less than 100%.  The high relative importance of the banking sector is \ncommon in many developing economies. In the PRC, however, it is particularly important due to \nthe large market size and fast growth. The PRC\u2019s financial institution assets have grown at a \ncompounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% since 2000, reaching $4.9 trillion at the end of \nMarch 2006\u2014about the same as the United Kingdom\u2019s financial sector (Appendix 2, Figure \nA2.2). \n \n7.  The banking sector is at the center of the Government\u2019s economic reforms. Measures to \nclean up the banks have improved asset quality and capitalization, and in many instances risk \nmanagement. However, uncertainties over the quality of banks\u2019 assets remain. In addition, \nlimited foreign participation in the sector and cultural resistance to foreign influence might \nconstrain the pace of reforms. The recapitalization costs for the banking system are a moving \ntarget,  and  one  of  the  major  risk  factors  constraining  the  PRC\u2019s  credit  profile  and  future \n                                                 \n5  China Banking Regulatory Commission. 2005.

", "  3\neconomic development.6  Please refer to Appendix 3 for an overview of the PRC\u2019s financial \nsector. \n \nB.  City Commercial Banks in the PRC Banking Sector \n1.  Overview  \n8.  The CCBs were formed through Government-directed amalgamations of urban credit \ncooperatives (UCC) in the mid to late 1990s. This amalgamation was partly a response to \ngalloping NPLs created by the unsustainable UCCs, and partly an effort to consolidate the \nfinancial  sector  to  achieve  economies  of  scale.  During  this  process,  however,  the  CCBs \nreceived full financial and managerial support by their respective city governments. Moreover, \nonly one CCB was created in each city (i.e., no competition for Government favors). Thus, \nCCBs remained a de facto part of the city governments\u2019 economic planning apparatus. This \nincluded significant directed lending to government priority projects and SOEs.  \n \n9.  Typically, CCBs still maintain very strong ties to their respective city governments. In \nmany cities, the respective governments still hold majority equity stakes. Some progressive \nCCBs have diversified shareholdings, which include local private and state-owned companies, \nas well as upgraded employees with increasing commercial skills. However, few CCBs have \nsubstantial private investment, and none is listed on any stock exchange.  \n \n10.  Although CCBs play an important role in their respective local banking sectors, their \ncontribution  to  the  PRC\u2019s  financial  sector  is  still  relatively  small.  Together,  the  112  CCBs \naccount for slightly more than 5% of the PRC banking sector\u2019s assets. Although small by \ncomparison to other banks in the PRC, CCBs serve cities that can be very large\u2014as large as \nsmall countries in some cases. For example, Bank of Beijing, Bank of Shanghai, and Chongqing \nCity Commercial Bank all operate in markets with populations of more than 10 million. Tianjin \nhas a population of 7.6 million, while Hangzhou has 3.9 million people.  \n \n11.  At the end of March 2006, CCB assets totaled CNY2.1 trillion, while CCB equity was \nCNY83.2 billion, according to CBRC. The average CCB NPL ratio was 7.6% at the end of March \n2006, compared with an average of 8.0% for the entire banking sector. In many cities, however, \nthe NPL ratio is still above 20%. As of March 2006, the weighted average capital adequacy ratio \nfor the CCB subsector had increased significantly to more than 5%, but remained below the \nrequired 8%. \n \n2.  Issues Facing CCBs and Policy Reform Initiatives \n12.  The CCBs have the potential to continue growing at a healthy rate in line with the PRC\u2019s \neconomy and banking sector. One forecaster anticipates CCBs will grow at a CAGR of 26%, \nreaching nearly $656 billion in assets by 2009.7  \n \n13.  However, most CCBs will have difficulty sustaining growth rates without jeopardizing \nasset  quality  and  capital  adequacy.  To  provide  competitive,  customer-driven  services  and \nproducts targeted at underserved segments of the markets in cities and regions of the PRC, the \nCCBs will have to develop their capabilities quickly to match those of a modern banking sector. \n                                                 \n6  The PRC\u2019s public sector debt to GDP ratio of 43% would double by adding in contingent liabilities associated with \nthe banking sector. Addressing this issue, therefore, might ultimately result in additional public expenditures.  \n7  CCID Consulting. 2005. 2004-05 China City Commercial Banks Research. Beijing. \n ", "4       \nIn this process, the CCBs will have to address some key issues, including (i) limited access to \nstate-of-the-art banking technology and know-how, (ii) lack of economies of scale in funding, (iii) \nundercapitalization and high levels of NPLs, (iv) a legacy of government influence in strategic \nfocus and in management, (v) lack of competitive experience due to the favored position in the \nrespective city, (vi) a history of deficient corporate governance and internal controls, and (vii) \nlimited growth prospects within each respective city. \n \n14.  To address these issues, several logical evolutionary steps are needed for this sector: (i) \ntie-ups with (foreign) strategic partners that can bring operational know-how, a competitive \nmindset, better governance, and capital; (ii) sales of significant equity stakes to nongovernment \nentities to dilute the influence of, and reliance on, the local government; (iii) cessation of further \nGovernment support to undercapitalized banks that are unable to meet CBRC capital adequacy \nrequirements by the prescribed deadlines; (iv) opening up of cities to competition from other \nCCBs (initially from the same province, but eventually CCBs from any part of the country); and \n(v)  consolidation  of  CCBs  into  fewer,  stronger  banks  that  are  more  capable  of  exploring \neconomies of scale. \n \n15.  The CBRC has outlined a four-point reform strategy to enhance the development and \nsupervision of CCBs:8 (i) CCBs should define clear market strategies to focus on local residents \nand SMEs, playing to their inherent competitive advantages; (ii) CCBs should resolve impaired \nassets through close cooperation with local governments and other means, such as asset \nswaps and the introduction of qualified strategic investors; (iii) CCBs should improve their \ncorporate governance structure and mechanisms; and (iv) the CBRC will adopt differentiated \npolicies and approaches in supervising different categories of CCBs, allowing a larger scope of \noperations for CCBs with sound management and good business performance, while preparing \na \u201cmarket exit\u201d for CCBs with high risks. Accordingly, the CBRC approved the first cross-city \nexpansion, allowing Bank of Shanghai to set up a branch in Ningbo. Further, six CCBs and \nseven  UCCs  in  Anhui  Province  were  restructured  recently  into  Huishang  Bank\u2014the  first \nregional commercial bank in the PRC created from the restructuring of local financial institutions \nwithin one province. \n \n3.  CCBs as Investment Opportunities \n16.  Several international financial institutions have invested in PRC commercial banks, using \ntheir  investments  as  a  tool  to  understand  the  country\u2019s  banking  industry  and  accumulate \noperating  experience.  However,  the  integration  of  the  PRC  banking  industry  into  the \ninternational market is in its infancy. In light of the huge opportunities in the PRC market, foreign \nbanks are facing the challenge of how to formulate and implement their PRC development \nstrategies. With the overwhelming size and limited availability of the SOCBs, foreign banks are \nlooking at JSCBs and CCBs as appropriate investments for entry into the PRC banking sector. \n \n17.  The  economic  profile  of  the  city  where  a  bank  is  located  largely  determines  the \ncommercial attractiveness of an investment in a CCB.  Generally, this is a function of the \npopulation size, economic growth prospects, and investment climate. In addition, the targeted \nbank  must  have  acceptable  asset  quality,  market  position,  and  management  willing  to \nimplement  changes.  Forbes  magazine  ranked  the  PRC  cities  with  the  best  investment \nenvironments: Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Shenzhen. It also ranked the top ten \n                                                 \n8 CBRC. 13 December 2005. CBRC outlined an overall strategy for supervision of city commercial banks. Beijing. ", "  5\nCCBs:9 HZCCB, Ningbo CCB, Dalian CCB, Bank of Shanghai, Wenzhou CCB, Bank of Beijing, \nSuzhou CCB, Wuxi CCB, Shaoxing CCB, and Shenzhen CCB. Similarly, The Banker magazine \nsurveyed and ranked the general competitiveness of 50 CCBs in 2004. Bank of Shanghai \nplaced first, followed by Tianjin CCB (TCCB), and HZCCB.10 The Rating Center of China\u2019s \nCommercial  Banks\u2019  Competitiveness  identified  the  top  five  commercial  banks  as  Bank  of \nShanghai, TCCB, HZCCB, Bank of Beijing, and Nanjing CCB.  \n \n18.  Not all of the 112 CCBs will be able to attract quality strategic partners, however. Thus, \nin the medium to long run, only a handful is expected to lead the consolidation and market \nexpansion efforts. The Private Sector Operations Division (PSOP) of ADB believes that only the \ntop 15\u201320 CCBs will find suitable strategic investors, and 30\u201340 at most will survive in the long \nterm. In line with this assessment, the Government appears prepared to take a hard stance \nagainst  supporting  CCBs  operating  with  high  risks,  including  contemplating  closure.11 The \nsurvivors will be the ones willing to change. To increase long-term viability and attractiveness to \npotential strategic partners, leading CCBs have focused over the past 2\u20133 years on improving \nasset quality, management, systems, and operations. Despite these efforts, only a few CCBs \nhave announced or completed equity investments with foreign strategic partners.12 \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED INVESTMENT \n19.  The proposed investment involves an equity participation of up to $30 million (or CNY \nequivalent) in HZCCB in the PRC, for approximately 5% of the bank\u2019s outstanding shares.13  \n \nA.  Project Selection \n20.  ADB uses a sector-wide portfolio approach to its financial sector investments in the \nPRC. Landmark projects in each subsector are identified and pursued based on their potential \ndemonstration effect and replicability by other institutions in the same subsector. To this end, \nADB has invested in one SOCB (Bank of China); one JSCB (China Everbright Bank); Xiamen \nInternational Bank, a foreign bank; and Credit Orienwise, a credit guarantee company based in \nShenzhen. Separately, ADB is pursuing other opportunities in the credit cooperative, rural bank, \nand  nonbank  subsectors.  As  such,  the  development  effects  of  ADB\u2019s  resources  are \nappropriately leveraged across the sector, and portfolio risk is diversified. \n \n21.  In  conjunction  with  the  East  Asia  Regional  Department  (EARD),  PSOP  made  the \nstrategic  decision  to  move  into  the  PRC\u2019s  CCB  subsector.  The  efforts  to  target  the  CCB \nsubsector began in early 2004 as a result of a joint PSOP-EARD mission to Tianjin and Dalian. \nThis mission generated a clear understanding that a successful demonstration effect from an \ninvestment in a CCB requires: (i) a local government supportive of change, and willing to modify \nand delineate its ownership role; (ii) a management team in place with a proven track record, a \nvision of strategic change, and the capability to implement it; (iii) a strong international strategic \npartner with expressed desire to invest in the CCB and cooperate with ADB; (iv) a local market \n                                                 \n9 Forbes. 2004.

Asia Pulse online edition (via Yahoo Finance). 2005. \nChina High-Risk City Commercial Banks To Be Phased Out. June 2005. \n12 Beijing, Jinan, Nanchong, Nanjing, Ningbo, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Xi\u2019an have announced deals. However, not all of \nthem have been signed or reached financial closure. \n13 The proposed equity investment received concept clearance on 20 October 2005. \n ", "6       \nfocused on private sector-led growth, as opposed to SOE-led economic activity; and (v) a bank \nwith the potential to lead the consolidation of the industry in the near to medium term. \n \n22.  CCBs with these characteristics would produce the demonstration effect ADB is seeking. \nTherefore, ADB must team up with (i) a strong strategic investor that is willing to invest know-\nhow as well as capital, and (ii) a CCB that is open to change. Based on an initial market \nassessment and ranking of CCBs, PSOP undertook desktop analyses of some 20 CCBs. From \nthis group, PSOP held initial meetings with seven CCBs during 2004 and 2005. PSOP also \ndiscussed potential targets with several international commercial banks interested in investing in \nCCBs in the PRC. From this process, HZCCB emerged as one of the preferred potential \ninvestment targets. \n \n23.  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) also approached ADB to gauge its interest in \ninvesting in HZCCB. This was a natural progression from several discussions between ADB and \nCBA over the previous year regarding possible cooperation and co-investment in the financial \nsector in the PRC. CBA is interested in establishing a long-term relationship with ADB for follow-\nup investments in other regions of the PRC (especially Inner Mongolia and Western PRC), as \nwell as other ADB developing member countries (DMC). ADB indicated its interest in a co-\ninvestment with CBA in HZCCB. However, due to a longer processing schedule, ADB noted that \nits own investment might not be ready at the same time as CBA\u2019s.  \n \n24.  HZCCB had been in discussions with other potential investors alongside CBA, including \nthe  bilateral  German  development  corporation  Deutsche  Entwicklungs-Gesellschaft,  the \nInternational  Finance  Corporation  (IFC),  and  Temasek  Holdings  of  Singapore.  Following \ninteractions over the next 3 months, HZCCB and the local government decided that ADB would \nbe their preferred partner.  \n \n25.  ADB\u2019s investments in the PRC over the past 2 years have refreshed the view in the \ninternational investment banking community of ADB as a credible investment partner that can \nadd significant value. As such, ADB should build on this momentum to maximize the catalytic \neffect its activities are yielding. ADB would strengthen its track record for follow-up investments \nin partnership with international commercial banks, especially in less-developed regions of the \nPRC (and elsewhere in the region), as well as in other selected subsectors of the PRC financial \nsystem. \n \nB.  The Investee Company: Hangzhou City Commercial Bank \n1.  Overview \n26.  HZCCB was formed in 1996 through the amalgamation of the Hangzhou\u2019s 33 UCCs. At \nthe  end  of  2005,  HZCCB  had  approximately  CNY46.3  billion  in  assets  ($5.8  billion)  and \nCNY27.1 billion ($3.4 billion) in loans. HZCCB is the fifth largest commercial bank in Hangzhou \nby assets after ICBC, China Construction Bank, Agriculture Bank of China (ABC) and Bank of \nChina (BOC). It has a loan market share of approximately 5%. China Financial News Center \nranks HZCCB as the third best CCB in the PRC,14 while a recent Moody\u2019s report on PRC\u2019s CCB \nsubsector ranked HZCCB second.15 HZCCB offers a comprehensive range of banking products \nand services, including corporate and individual loans, deposits, trade finance, agency services, \n                                                 \n14 China Financial News Center. 2005.

HZCCB \nhas approximately 26,000 corporate customers and 1.5 million individual customers. It is a \nmarket leader in the SME and mass retail segments in the city. \n \n2.  Business Scope \n27.  HZCCB\u2019s business is divided into three areas: corporate banking, retail banking, and \ntreasury (money markets and investments). In terms of market positioning, HZCCB has branded \nitself as a \u201ccustomer focused\u201d local bank, offering one-stop services.  \n \n28.  Aiming to expand its service offerings and deepen its client base, HZCCB has applied \nfor a foreign exchange business license. Further, HZCCB expects to apply for a derivative \nlicense in 2007, when appropriate internal controls and risk management systems are ready for \nderivative products. HZCCB will be seeking expertise from CBA to help implement this process. \n \n3.  Competition \n29.  HZCCB commands a strong competitive position in the Hangzhou market due to its \nlarge branch network, close alliance with the local government, and positioning in the mass \nretail and SME segments. Including HZCCB, 16 commercial banks operate in Hangzhou. These \ninclude the \u201cbig four\u201d SOCBs (ABC, ICBC, CCB, BOC), which exert the main competitive \npressure, and 11 regional banks.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  Equity Investment  \n30.  ADB proposes an equity investment of up to $30,000,000 in CNY equivalent (or, if ADB \nis unable to fund in CNY, in US dollars) in HZCCB, to purchase or subscribe approximately 5% \nof the bank\u2019s outstanding ordinary shares, either via the purchase of shares available for sale by \nan HZCCB shareholder, or via subscription of newly issued shares by HZCCB. \n \n1.  Exit Strategy \n31.  Exit  would  be  considered  once  the  developmental  role  of  ADB  has  taken  effect. \nFollowing the planned IPO, ADB might sell its stake in the public markets. Alternatively, once \nownership and geographical limits are relaxed, CCBs might become targets for consolidation by \nbanks aiming to increase their nationwide coverage. As such, ADB might sell its stake in a \nnegotiated transaction to a third party. CBA also might be interested in increasing its stake \nwithin regulations.  \n \n32.  The recent success of BOC\u2019s IPO shows the viability of this exit option. Investors from \nPRC; Hong Kong, China; and the US are keen to get access to bank shares in the PRC. A well-\nrun and highly profitable CCB would be an attractive alternative for investors looking for growth \ninvestment opportunities away from the mainstream. \n \n2.  ADB Capacity Transfer \n33.  ADB would assist HZCCB in the following areas: (i) improving corporate governance and \ninternal controls; (ii) strengthening measures for combating money laundering, corruption, and \nterrorism financing; (iii) formulating an environmental management and safeguards system, and \nproviding appropriate training; and (iv) formulating a strategy for SME lending, and designing \n ", "8       \nnew  and  innovative  financing  products  and  tools  for  this  market.  ADB  would  enter  into  a \nstrategic cooperation agreement with HZCCB, similar to the one between CBA and HZCCB, \noutlining the terms and conditions of ADB know-how transfer. ADB and CBA have tailored their \nrespective programs to avoid overlap.16 \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Justification for the ADB Investment  \n1.  Investment Rationale \n \n34.  An efficient financial system promotes sustainable economic growth, which generates \nemployment and reduces poverty. Financial intermediation, particularly through the banking \nsector, is the main engine for economic growth. The banking sector dominates the financial \nsystem in the PRC. However, the inefficiency of the sector has been identified as one of the \ngreatest  obstacles  to  long-term  growth,  especially  with  regard  to  SMEs.  (Appendix  1). \nRecognizing the need to improve the banking sector, the Government has encouraged its \nbanks, especially SOCBs, to undergo reform. For certain qualified banks, the Government has \npromoted the involvement of private domestic and foreign strategic investors. The first stage of \nreforms targeted the \u201cbig four\u201d SOCBs. Now the focus of reforms is on the network of 112 CCBs \nthat serve major urban areas throughout the PRC. These CCBs play\u2014and will continue to \nplay\u2014a vital role in and around the cities they serve, especially in SME development. However, \nCCBs will have to address some significant issues before they can improve, including strategic \nrisk, poor corporate governance, weak risk management, and low capital adequacy ratios. The \nsuccess of the PRC\u2019s banking reforms, SME development, and economic growth hinges on the \nability of the PRC banks, especially the CCBs, to address these challenges properly. \n \n35.  CBRC views the introduction of experienced and qualified overseas strategic investors \nas an effective method to promote and enhance this reform process.17 On the micro level, the \nsale of strategic stakes in these banks boosts capital, dilutes government influence, provides \naccess to strategic and operational know-how, and brings better corporate governance. The \nenhanced strategic focus and increased capital also will help the bank become more prepared \nfor competition in its home market. Further, this will enable the bank to take advantage of \ngrowth opportunities in new markets via acquisitions, mergers, or strategic cooperation with \nbanks in other cities and provinces; or via greenfield organic establishment in such markets. \nHowever, while the growth prospects of the PRC\u2019s banking sector are attractive to investors, \ninternational banks remain wary of taking minority stakes even in relatively higher-quality CCBs. \nTheir main concerns are (i) the untested governance framework; (ii) the strategic partner\u2019s \npotential inability as minority investor to influence strategic direction, management, and equity \ndistributions; and (iii) uncertainty over the continued role of local government. \n \n36.  In summary, the overall progress of PRC banks is still lagging behind banks in other \ncountries in the region. The lack of a consistent nationwide credit database impedes lending \n                                                 \n16 This capacity transfer for HZCCB, as part of the equity investment, is similar to the technical assistance package \nprovided to BOC in parallel with ADB\u2019s equity investment. That technical assistance was to improve BOC\u2019s \ncorporate governance by tackling three key areas: (i) operational risk management, (ii) anti-money laundering \nmanagement,  and  (iii)  environmental  risk  management.  ADB\u2019s  equity  investment  contributed  to  the  larger \nundertaking by BOC and the Government to make BOC more transparent, commercially sound, and properly \ngoverned. \n17 China Banking Regulatory Commission. 2005. Latest Developments in China\u2019s Banking Reform, Opening-up and \nSupervision. Beijing. 5 December. ", "  9\ndecisions, even ignoring the cultural and political incentives against steering credit away from \nSOEs given this information. Administered benchmark lending rates also distort the pricing of \ncredit risk. The foreign ownership infusion thus far will not change things quickly, because of the \nminimal scale. While these are valid concerns regarding the PRC banking sector, they are also \na strong argument for ADB involvement. ADB can help change system failures through a \nbottom-up approach that tackles issues step by step and transaction by transaction. In ADB\u2019s \nview,  transactions  provide  critical  vehicles  for  \u201clearning  by  doing.\u201d  They  demonstrate  to \nGovernment officials and stakeholders the imperative to improve the country environment (e.g., \nlegal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks), and enable the identification of appropriate \ncountry-specific priorities. In essence, transactions can \u201ctest\u201d for priority changes and signal \nappropriate  customized  enhancements,  creating  the  demand  and  dynamic  for  focused \nprioritized reforms.18 \n  \n2.  Development Impact and Effectiveness \n \n37.  In summary, an investment in HZCCB would impact development by (i) promoting the \ndevelopment of a lagging financial sector, thereby increasing access of SMEs to finance, in a \nshowcase region with strong private sector, SME-driven economic development; (ii) supporting \nthe transformation of a leading CCB, especially in corporate governance, internal control, and \nenvironmental sensibility, which would send a strong demonstration signal to other CCBs in the \ncountry; (iii) indirectly fostering economic development of non-coastal regions in the PRC; and \n(iv) supporting the Government\u2019s efforts to restructure the banking sector. \n \n38.  Financial Sector Development in Zhejiang Province and SME Development. The \nfinancial sector in Zhejiang Province is lagging behind the rest of the local economy. The \nZhejiang Province Finance Bureau19 reported that the financial services sector contributed only \n4.44% of the province\u2019s GDP in 2004, lower than the 6% national average. Thus, the Finance \nBureau  considers  the  need  for  reform  \u201cclearly  urgent.\u201d  The  Government  is  focusing  on \nencouraging foreign investors to invest in local financial institutions. By attracting advanced \nmanagement  experience,  the  government  hopes  the  province  will  improve  the  ownership \nstructures and internal controls, and strengthen the competitiveness of these institutions. To \nachieve this, the provincial government is adopting policies to support efforts to attract foreign \nfinancial institutions. \n \n39.  A more developed financial sector in Zhejiang would enhance the service offerings and \nterms of financing for its SME-driven economy. SMEs are the drivers of economic growth in the \nPRC. However, their lack of access to bank financing remains a crucial stumbling block to more \nbroad-based development (Appendix 1). HZCCB would become a more responsive partner for \nthe  companies  in  an  economically  important  region,  as  well  as  force  competing  financial \ninstitutions in the region to improve their product offerings, service levels, and operations. Such \ncompetitive dynamics would yield widespread market benefits.  \n \n40.  Demonstration  Effect for Banking Sector  Reform. A successful transformation of \nHZCCB  could  be  replicated  by  other  investors  in  other  CCBs,  giving  this  Project  a  high \ndemonstration effect potential. By jointly investing in HZCCB, ADB and CBA demonstrate the \nvalue of HZCCB\u2019s early reforms to more than 100 other CCBs that are struggling to achieve \n                                                 \n18  This has been one of the major findings and recommendations of the World Economic Forum, Financing for \nDevelopment Initiative, January 2006 (page 17), with respect to the private sector operations of multilateral \ninstitutions. \n19 Zhejiang Province Finance Bureau. 2005.

Memorandum given to the ADB mission. \n ", "10      \nwhat HZCCB is expected to accomplish with the help of its strategic investors. In PSOP\u2019s \nscreening of CCBs, HZCCB emerged as the best candidate for ADB\u2019s first investment in a PRC \nCCB. HZCCB, which ranks among the top four CCBs in the PRC, is a prime, SME-focused bank \nthat would enhance sustainable growth directly in the province. It has been a leader in resolving \nlegacy NPLs and improving credit policies, and is making progress in enhancing its corporate \ngovernance.  \n \n41.  Economic Development. An investment in one of the most dynamic regions in the PRC \nwould help economic development in other regions as well. Zhejiang Province is a net investor, \nthrough its legions of SMEs and large companies investing in other parts of the PRC.20 \n \n42.  Support  of  PRC  Government,  Lastly,  the  proposed  investment  would  support  the \nGovernment\u2019s  plans  to  restructure  CCBs  further,  and  would  promote  private  sector-led \ndevelopment.  As  a  result,  employment  at  borrowing  companies  would  be  sustained  or \nincreased, thus promoting job creation, economic growth, and poverty reduction. \n \n43.  Appendix 4 presents a more detailed outline of the major development outcomes and \nmeasures for development effectiveness. \n \n3.  Poverty Reduction and Medium-Term Strategy \n \n44.  The proposed investment is in line with ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.21 The strategy \nstates that ADB seeks to promote \u201csound and efficient banking systems and capital markets,\u201d \nsince these are seen as \u201cindispensable for macroeconomic stability, mobilizing savings, and \nensuring availability of long-term financing, an essential requirement for pro-poor growth.\u201d 22 \nPromoting  mainstream  finance  does  not  contradict  a  focus  on  poverty.  The  share  of  the \npopulation  living  in  poverty  is  closely  correlated  with  average  national  per  capita  income. \nHowever, the impact on poverty is typically indirect. It takes place through the multiplier effect \nthat a functioning financial sector has on the economy, including the strengthening of the SME \nsector and other growth engines. These indirect effects enable the economy to function better, \nincrease  jobs,  improve  the  scale  and  efficiency  of  capital  utilization,  and  increase  labor \nproductivity and demand. 23 The proposed investment would support ADB\u2019s poverty reduction \nstrategy by assisting HZCCB\u2019s transition to a market-viable commercial bank, making the bank \nan example in the CCB subsector and a leader in the field of SME finance. \n \n45.   The proposed project is also in line with the Medium-Term Strategy II (2006\u20132008) of \nMarch 2006, which declares the financial sector as a \u201ccore I\u201d focus area for ADB. \n \n \n                                                 \n20  Examples of HZCCB clients having invested outside of Zhejiang Province include Zhejiang Glass Factory, which \ninvested CNY500 million in a remote area in Xinjiang Autonomous Region in the far west. Another company, Wua \nHa Ha, an investment company, has invested in many projects in the south-central province of Sichuan. Zhejiang \nCuisine is a chain of restaurants that has expanded across the PRC. \n21  ADB. 1999. Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy. Manila. \n22  This is supported by a recent United Nations report, which noted that \u201cit is impossible for a country to progress \nwithout domestic investment based on domestic savings. This requires financial institutions that can effectively \nmanage risk and allocate capital to productive investment.\u201d However, the report continues, a financial sector should \nhave high private sector participation, as best practices typically are driven by leading private sector banks.

Through this investment, ADB delivers value to HZCCB by assisting in the development \nof adequate corporate governance and internal control procedures, as well as in opportunities \nfor commercial cooperation. ADB also adds value to HZCCB\u2019s shareholders by fulfilling the role \nof an \u201chonest broker\u201d that has only the bank\u2019s best interests at heart. \n \nC.  Fit to Sector and Country Strategy24 \n47.  ADB\u2019s country strategy and program (CSP) 25 for the PRC aims to address poverty \nprimarily through pro-poor economic growth. At the center of this strategy is the enhancement of \nmarkets  by  promoting  good  governance  and  expanding  ADB\u2019s  private  sector  operations,  \nespecially in preparation for intensified competition in the financial sector brought about by WTO \naccession. \n \n48.  The CSP recommends that ADB enhance governance in the financial sector by (i) \nencouraging financial institutions to adopt sound corporate governance standards in harmony \nwith  international  best  practices;  (ii)  strengthening  the  legal,  regulatory,  and  supervisory \nframework, as well as the institutional capabilities, of financial market regulators, banks, and \nother financial institutions; and (iii) setting minimum criteria for sound corporate governance \nstandards by market participants. Regarding private sector operations, the CSP specifically \nrecommends that ADB take equity positions in domestic financial institutions, such as banks, to \npromote financial sector reforms and good corporate governance. The proposed investment and \nits objectives, therefore, are in line with the CSP. \n \n49.  Furthermore, ADB recognizes SMEs as one of the economic growth engines in Asia. \nConsequently, ADB has committed significant resources to promoting projects that assist SMEs \nthrough  country-specific  and  regional  TA  programs.26 ADB  also  has  made  private  sector \ninvestments in financial intermediaries, such as banks, investment funds, and credit guarantee \ncompanies that  target SME  clients.  In  the  PRC,  SMEs  are  one  of ADB\u2019s  key  operational \nobjectives. Through previous TAs, ADB has helped to draft the SME Promotion Law, as well as \nthe policies and regulations for the Government-sponsored SME Development Fund. ADB also \nsupported the All China Federation of Industry and Commerce to identify constraints faced by \nSMEs and the private sector. The output of this intervention became an essential part of the \nPRC  Private  Sector  Assessment.  Further,  ADB  supported  the  enabling  environment  for \ndevelopment of SMEs from the supply side, specifically through two ADB TAs: (i) Development \nof a Small and Medium\u2013sized Enterprise Credit Support System (TA 3493), which introduced \nbest international practices on credit guarantee mechanisms and identified constraints faced by \nSMEs in the PRC; and (ii) Development of SME Financing Support System (TA 3534), which \nidentified policy and regulatory constraints faced by SMEs and alternative financing schemes for \nSMEs. The ADB Private Sector Assessment for the PRC27 encourages ADB to support the \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2003.

Private Sector Operations Department Strategic Approach \n50.  The  Private  Sector  Operations  Department  (PSOD),  EARD,  and  the  PRC  Resident \nMission (PRCM) have worked closely together on financial sector reforms in the PRC, leading to \nthe development of a joint business plan. ADB\u2019s policy dialogue with the Government works \nhand-in-hand with\u2014and complements\u2014ADB\u2019s private sector operations in the PRC. ADB has \nmade  substantial  progress  over  the  past  2  years  in  developing  opportunities  for  equity \ninvestments in PRC financial institutions. In the process, ADB has created strong relationships \nwith local government officials, bank regulators, financial institutions, and potential international \nstrategic  partners.  These  efforts  are  starting  to  bear  fruit:  the  Government  and  financial \ninstitutions are looking to ADB as a value-added partner to invest and promote change. As the \nGovernment  pushes  forward  with  the  necessary  reforms  and  restructuring  of  the  financial \nsector, and international banks eagerly explore opportunities to invest in PRC banks, ADB has a \nwindow of opportunity to co-invest and add value. The visibility of successful equity investments \nshould enhance ADB\u2019s overall profile in the PRC, and allow ADB to maximize developmental \nimpact. \n \n51.  ADB\u2019s strategy for financial sector investments in the PRC has been guided by the three \npillars of the transformation of the PRC banking and financial sector: (i) reducing NPLs, (ii) \nrestructuring  government-owned  banks,  and  (iii)  promoting  a  stronger  credit  culture  and \ncompetitiveness in the banking and financial sector. ADB\u2019s interventions have been targeted at \n(i) reducing NPLs by providing financing to third-party investors participating in NPL sales or \nauctions; (ii) investing in PRC banks to support their transformation into commercially viable \ninstitutions based on sound corporate governance principles; and (iii) providing debt and/or \nequity  funding  for  niche  banks  and  nonbank  financing  entities  (such  as  credit  guarantee \ncompanies) to enhance the credit culture and sector specialization, particularly for financing of \nSMEs. The proposed investment fits the latter two categories\u2014banking sector reform and SME \ndevelopment\u2014and forms part of a suite of private sector interventions by ADB that are designed \nto be complementary in impact and diversified in exposure. \n \n52.  In addition to the investment in BOC, ADB has made two previous equity investments in \nPRC banks to support sector reform. In the early and mid-1990s, ADB invested in China \nEverbright Bank and Xiamen International Bank. Through these investments, ADB learned the \nfollowing key criteria for success: (i) careful assessment of the willingness of the investee \ncompany to implement strategic and operational change, (ii) Government support for ADB\u2019s \ninvestment, (iii) thorough due diligence and appropriate risk mitigation, (iv) strong strategic \npartners, and (v) a board representation in certain instances. All such issues are expected to be \nadequately addressed in this investment.  \n \n53.  ADB\u2019s first private sector investment to support SME development in the PRC was the \n$10 million equity investment in Shenzhen Orienwise Guarantee and Investment Co., Ltd.28, an \nSME-focused credit guarantee company. This transaction closed financially in March 2005. ADB \ncatalyzed an additional $25 million of equity from CVC Capital Partners, Hong Kong, a wholly \nowned subsidiary of Citigroup. Currently, another equity partner is being catalyzed. The second \n                                                 \n28 ADB. 2004.

For HZCCB, a holistic investment approach is being used. It is part of the business plan \nprepared by PSOP and EARD, as well as the wider examination of the CCB sector in the PRC. \nThe information and experience gained from this investment is expected to complement the joint \nresearch, and establish the basis for policy reform advice to the Government. \n \nE.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Issues \n55.  The investment has been classified as FI under ADB\u2019s environmental policy. ADB will \nadvise HZCCB on its safeguard policies, and discuss their relevance and importance. HZCCB \nwill be required to adopt an appropriate environmental management system (EMS) and undergo \ntraining in environmental impact assessment and auditing.  \n \n56.  Since the investment does not require any resettlement and will not impact indigenous \npeoples, the investment has been assigned category \u201cC\u201d with regard to ADB\u2019s indigenous \npeoples and resettlement policies.  \n \nF.

HZCCB has been advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy and Policy for Combating \nMoney Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require HZCCB to institute, maintain, \nand comply with internal procedures and controls following international best practice standards \nfor the purpose of preventing corruption or money laundering activities, or the financing of \nterrorism. HZCCB will be required to covenant with ADB to refrain from engaging in such \nactivities. Further, the investment documentation between ADB and HZCCB will allow ADB to \ninvestigate any violation or potential violation of these undertakings. The financial due diligence \nconducted by Ernst & Young and Haiwen & Partners (Haiwen) did not reveal any major prior or \npending corruption cases.  \n \nG.

Manila. \n30 Banking regulations in the PRC have gone through substantial changes in recent years. To improve the financial \nsystem, a number of measures have been implemented, which included converging PRC GAAP with IFRS to \nimprove  financial  reporting  transparency.  It  is  likely  that  IAS39  (Financial  Instruments:  Recognition  and \nMeasurement) and IAS32 (Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation) will be applied from early 2007. \n ", "14      \n59.  Beginning with the financial year ending 31 December 2005, HZCCB has retained Ernst \n& Young to audit its annual accounts. In accordance with PBOC regulations, HZCCB is required \nto disclose to the public selected data and other information in April of each year. \n \nH.  Transaction Risks \n60.  ADB  has  conducted  comprehensive  business,  financial,  and  legal  due  diligence  to \ndetermine the viability of the investment. ADB has retained Ernst & Young, an international \naccounting and auditing firm specializing in transaction services for potential investors, to assist \nin the financial due diligence. It also has retained as international counsel Clifford Chance, a \nleading law firm specializing in corporate and investment law in the PRC and the rest of Asia. \nFurther, ADB has retained Haiwen as PRC counsel to assist in the legal due diligence and \nnegotiation of the investment documentation. In addition to meetings with senior management, \nADB,  Ernst  &  Young,  and  Haiwen  &  Partners  had  access  to  detailed  data  and  financial \ninformation from HZCCB, as well as full disclosure by CBA of the due diligence it carried out for \nthis investment (which covered in detail operational matters, such as IT and human resources). \n \n61.  The due diligence and review of HZCCB\u2019s strategy support an investment by ADB.  \n \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n62.  The proposed investment, which is PSOD's 14th in the PRC, would, once approved by \nthe Board, represent 1.7% of PSOD's total exposure,31 increase its investments (i) in the PRC \nby 1.4 percentage point, from 14.4% of PSOD's total exposure to 15.8%; and (ii) in banking \nsystems from 17.6% to 19.0%. The proposed investment is within the approved aggregate, \ncountry, industry, group, single project and equity investment limits for ADB\u2019s private sector \nprojects. ADB will not be the single largest investor, and its investment will not exceed the 25% \nof total capital of HZCCB. \n \n63.  A framework agreement confirming ADB\u2019s status, privileges, and immunities with respect \nto its equity investments and lending operations in the private sector is in effect between the \nPRC and ADB. Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank, the \nGovernment will be asked to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed ADB equity \ninvestment. No investment will be disbursed until ADB receives such confirmation. \n \n64.  ADB will enter into negotiated share purchase and subscription agreements, and other \nlegally required documents, following approval of the proposed investment by ADB\u2019s Board of \nDirectors. These agreements will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n31  Exposure refers to drawn and undrawn portions of committed loan, equity investments, and guarantees as of 31 \nMarch 2006. An investment is considered committed when the legal agreements are signed. ", " 15\nVII.  RECOMMENDATION \n65.  I am satisfied that the proposed investment would comply with the Articles of Agreement \nof the ADB and recommend that the Board approve the investment of up to $30,000,000 in CNY \nequivalent (or, if ADB is unable to fund in CNY, in US dollars) for approximately 5% of the equity \nin  HZCCB  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  on  terms  and  conditions  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as will be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n \n30 June 2006 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "16    Appendix 1 \nTHE PEOPLE\u2019S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC) ECONOMY \n \n1.  Economic Overview \n \n1.  The PRC\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) increased from $150 billion in 1980 to an \nestimated $2.26 trillion in 2005, with an average annual growth of over 9%. Its foreign trade rose \nduring the same period from $20 billion to $1.2 trillion, surpassing that of Japan. The PRC is \ncurrently the fourth largest economy in the world, upon revised GDP growth figure of 10.1% in \n2004 and official-estimate of 9.9% for 2005, surpassing the United Kingdom and France; by \n2015 it could be the third largest economy, surpassing Germany. The PRC is rated A- by \nStandard & Poor\u2019s and A2 by Moody\u2019s. \n \n2.  Strong economic growth has substantially increased per capita income. In particular, the \nper capita annual disposable income of urban households has risen significantly over the past 4 \nyears (Table A1.1; data for 2005 not yet available). Such growth will foster a growing demand \nfor banking products and services.  \n \nTable A1.1: Key Economic Data \n(As of the year ended 31 December) \nItem  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005\nNominal GDP (CNY billion)  8,947 9,731 10,240 11,669 15,988  18,232 a\nReal GDP growth (%)  8.0 7.3 8.0 9.1 10.1  9.9 a\nPopulation (in millions)  1,267 1,276 1,285 1,292 1,308  \u2014 \nGDP per capita (CNY)  7,086 7,651 7,997 9,032 11,586  \u2014 \nPer  capita  annual  6,280 6,860 7,703 8,472 9,422  \u2014 \ndisposable income of urban \nhouseholds (CNY) \n \u2014 = not available, CNY = yuan, GDP = gross domestic product. \na Based on preliminary estimates by the National Bureau of Statistics of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSource: National Bureau of Statistics of the PRC. \n \n3.  The PRC\u2019s economy appears to be accelerating in 2006, after a modest slowdown in \n2005, with year-end 2005 GDP growth estimated at 9.9%. Net exports and investment continue \nto drive the growth momentum, and thus far higher global oil prices does not appear to have \ndented domestic demand, higher energy prices have not fed through to inflation, and core \ninflation remain below 1%.  \n \n4.  Public  sector  demand  dynamics  have  improved  with  the  country\u2019s  strong  fiscal \nperformance in recent years. The fiscal deficit narrowed from 2.9% of GDP in 2002 to an \nestimated 1.9% of GDP for 2005, despite increased spending as a share of GDP. Expenditure \noutlays were up 15% year-on-year in 1H05 amid higher outlays on social security and the \nagricultural sector. \n \n5.  The strong economic performance of recent years has been anchored in export-oriented \nindustrial  production  and  powered  by  investment.  In  2005,  the  industry  sector,  primarily \nmanufacturing and construction, contributed 7.1 percentage points to the total GDP growth \noutturn (accounting for 71% of overall growth); the contribution of agriculture declined to 0.5 \npercentage points (6%); and that of services was little changed at 2.3 percentage points (23%). \nOn the demand side vibrant investment again propelled growth, contributing 5.9 percentage \npoints to total growth in 2005 (60% of overall growth); consumption contributed 3.2 percentage \npoints (32%); and net exports just under 1 percentage point (8%). ", "  Appendix 1  17 \n \n6.  Despite strong economic expansion, consumer inflation eased to 1.8% in 2005. Food \nprices barely rose and productivity improvements helped insulate consumer goods prices from \nthe rising costs of production materials and labor. Oversupply of some products and moderate \ndemand intensified competition among producers, also discouraging price rises. \n \n7.  The  phenomenal  economic  expansion  has  led  to  various  structural  weaknesses, \nincluding  overcapacity  in  certain  sectors,  widening  income  inequalities,  and  environmental \nproblems. \n \n2.

These are largely the by-product of a successful strategy of rapid \nindustrialization and modernization. Signs of growing stress include significant overcapacity in \nsome industries; widening income inequalities, particularly between rural and urban areas; and \ngrowing threats to the environment. \n \n9.  GDP growth in 2006 is expected to be about 9.5% and 8.8% in 2007. Agriculture is \nforecast to expand by about 5.0\u20135.5%, industrial growth is forecast to slow to 9\u201310% from about \n11%  in  the  past  2  years,  as  a  consequence  of  significant  oversupply  in  some  sectors, \nmoderation of investment expansion, and deceleration in export growth. The services sector is \nexpected to grow by 9.5% in 2006, aided by the Government\u2019s efforts to promote private \nconsumption  and  services.  Notwithstanding  the  aim  of  rebalancing demand  toward  private \nconsumption and an anticipated slowing of growth of capital spending in manufacturing and real \nestate, investment will remain the dominant driver of growth in 2006 and 2007. \n \n10.  In 2006, merchandise export growth is likely to moderate to 20%. Import growth is \nforecast at a similar rate, as demand for energy, basic materials, agricultural products, and \nintermediate industrial inputs will continue to expand rapidly. A rising merchandise trade surplus \nwill be partly offset by a deficit on the services account. The current account surplus as a share \nof GDP is expected to be in the range of 5\u20137% in 2006\u20132007. \n \n11.

Main Considerations in Banking Sector and Capital Markets \n \n1.  Overview. Despite the monetary and financial sector reforms,2 the financial sector does \nnot meet the needs of a market economy. Indirect monetary policy instruments (e.g., open \nmarket  operations)  are  not  fully  developed  and  interest rate  policy  remains  inflexible.  The \nregulatory and supervisory framework for banks and nonbank financial institutions remains \nweak.  Despite  substantial  progress, 3  the  capital  markets  are  underdeveloped  and  not \nadequately  regulated  and  supervised.  Weaknesses  in  the  banking  sector,  high  levels  of \nnonperforming loan (NPLs), incomplete state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms, and incomplete \npension reforms remain causes of concern. The People\u2019s Bank of China (PBOC), the China \nSecurities  Regulatory  Commission  (CSRC),  the  China  Insurance  Regulatory  Commission \n(CIRC),  and  the  China  Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (CBRC)  are  placing  increased \nemphasis on improving corporate governance in the financial sector. \n \n2.  Since  2003,  banking  sector  regulatory  and  supervisory  responsibilities  have  been \ndivided between PBOC and CBRC. PBOC, guided by the State Council, is responsible for \nformulating and implementing monetary policy and for enacting safeguards to ensure financial \nstability. CBRC is the main regulator of the banking sector and its responsibilities include \nformulating and enforcing the supervisory rules and regulations governing bank institutions. \n \n3.  Banking. There are 4 state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs),4 3 policy banks,5 12 \njoint-stock  banks,  112  city  commercial  banks  (CCBs),  as  well  as  foreign  banks.6 Banking \ndominates the financial market with around 80% share in total assets.7 The profitability of \nSOCBs and the policy banks is lower than what would be acceptable to commercial banks in a \nmarket economy. SOCBs and policy banks have devoted most of their lending to SOEs or \ndesignated development projects, while the joint-stock and city commercial banks are more \nprivate sector-oriented and lend to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).8 \n \n4.  Plans are implemented to modernize SOCBs and the joint-stock commercial banks have \nbeen encouraged to merge and restructure. The SOCBs will be corporatized as an initial step in \nthe restructuring process. Over the last 4 years, they have closed more than 21,000 branch \noffices and shed more than 100,000 personnel. The joint-stock commercial banks are now \nmoving to list on the stock exchanges. \n \n5.  The PRC regulators place numerous restrictions on permissible products, services, and \nactivities of domestic and foreign banks. For example, there are still restrictions on commercial \nbanks offering fee-based products. Interest rates on loans and deposits offered by commercial \nbanks are still subject to PBOC regulations even after recent reform measures that gave banks \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program (2004\u20132006): People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila. \n2  Adoption of the Central Bank and Commercial Bank Laws in 1995; the ADB-supported Securities Law in 1999; \nestablishment  of  CBRC,  CSRC,  and  CIRC  as  independent  regulators;  setting  up  four  asset  management \ncompanies to help address the NPL problems, and allowing more foreign participation in the financial sector; and \nseparation of CBRC from PBOC in 2003. \n3  The PRC did not have a capital market until the early 1990s. \n4  Agriculture Bank of China, Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and China Construction Bank. \n5  China Development Bank, Agricultural Development Bank of China, and Chine Export-Import Bank. \n6  There are 240 foreign bank representative offices, 160 branches of foreign banks, and 13 locally registered foreign \nbank subsidiaries. Over 30 foreign banks obtained licenses to conduct yuan business before WTO accession. \n7  As of 2000, banking sector deposits stood at CNY12 trillion (150% of GDP), while loans were below CNY10 trillion. \n8  Twelve percent of total SOCB lending was to private enterprises; 80% of non-SOCB lending went to small and \nmedium-sized enterprises. ", "  Appendix 3  21 \nmore latitude in setting such interest rates. On the other hand, the PRC Government has been \ngradually liberalizing the banking sector by allowing new product offerings and expanding the \nlimits  within  which  commercial  banks  may  set  their  CNY  lending  rates.  In  particular,  on \n29 October 2004, the PBOC removed the upper limit for CNY lending rates (other than rates on \nmortgage loans to individuals) charged by financial institutions, excluding credit cooperatives, \nwhile retaining the lower limit for such rates. Since that date, all deposit-taking institutions have \nbeen permitted to decrease (but not increase) CNY deposit rates to below the corresponding \nPBOC benchmark rates. These changes give banks more freedom to develop products to meet \nmarket needs and to offer more flexibility in determining pricing of their products. \n \n6.  The five-category loan classification system was adopted at the end of 2001, after trial \ntesting  in  Guangdong  province.9 Commercial  banks  now  stop  interest  accrual  if  a  loan  is \noverdue by 90 days. Banks are requested to make adequate loan provisioning for bad debts.10 \nAccording to CBRC, the NPL ratio of major commercial banks fell to 8.9% as of the end of 2005, \nor 4.3 percentage points lower than at the end of 2004. \n \n7.  PRC\u2019s senior bank regulators acknowledged that the PRC banking system is not ready \nfor Basel II. A revised version of Basel I was announced in 2004 that requires an 8% minimum \ncapital adequacy ratio plus provisions for supervision and information disclosure. Banks are \nrequired to meet the requirement before the end of 2006. At the end of 2004, 30 banks met the \nrequirement of 8% minimum capital adequacy ratio. China Banking Regulatory Commission has \nmade it clear that Basel II IRB implementation will be important in the near term for at least \nPRC\u2019s large state-owned banks but no clear implementation timetable has been announced yet. \nThe top four state-owned banks\u2014the ICBC, the Bank of China, the Agriculture Bank of China \nand the China Construction Bank\u2014all have actually started preparing to implement Basel II and \nplan to invest heavily on IT infrastructure to meet Basel II requirements. \n \n8.  Capital Markets. Although the capitalization of the securities market continues to grow, \nSOEs  dominate  the  listed  firms.  About  70%  of  the  SOE  shares  are  nontradable.  The \ngovernment and regulators are exploring options to sell state shares without disrupting the \nmarkets and allow entry of foreign securities firms in line with WTO accession agreement. \n   \n9.  While market forces will exert pressure on how listed enterprises are organized and \nmanaged,  corporate  governance  of  listed  enterprises  has  the  following  weaknesses:  (i) \nFragmented control structure for SOEs; (ii) opaque ownership structures; (iii) poor internal \ncontrol  arrangements,  with  generally  dominant  management  and  board  of  directors,  weak \nindependent board of supervisors, and inadequate protection of minority shareholder rights; (iv) \nlow or no professional requirements for membership of boards; (v) restrictions on resale of \nshares held by promoters and directors; and (vi) poor disclosure practices, lack of transparency, \npoor accounting and auditing practices, and misleading or fraudulent financial statements. \n \n10.  Fundamental changes are needed to strengthen the capital market. The Securities Law, \nCompany  Law,  Trust  Law,  and  other  related  regulations  need  to  be  rationalized  to  clarify \nCSRC\u2019s investigative, enforcement, and disciplinary powers. However, the implicit preference \nfor listings by SOEs continues, despite the recent efforts to change the quota system. \n \n11.  State-Owned Enterprises. While the SOEs were the backbone of the PRC\u2019s economy \nduring the central planning era, their role in GDP has declined over the last two decades.11 The \n                                                 \n9  The five categories are standard, special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. \n10 Although general provisioning before tax is allowed up to 1% of the total outstanding loans. \n11  The contribution of SOEs to GDP fell from 58% in 1980 to 37% in 2000, and the share of the SOEs in gross \nindustrial output fell from 37% in 1994 to 25% in 2000, but they still account for 55% of employment. \n ", "22  Appendix 3 \nfinancial  performance  of  some  SOEs  has  been  weak  due  to  poor  management,  poor \ntechnology,  political  interference,  poor  investment  decisions,  soft  budget  constraints, \noveremployment, heavy social welfare responsibilities, and lack of competitiveness. In recent \nyears, however, the performance of some SOEs has improved. \n \n12.  Beginning in 1997, the Government of the PRC launched a campaign to reform SOEs to \nrestructure large SOEs that were able to compete globally and privatize small ones. Thousands \nof smaller SOEs were sold, closed, or merged. About 26 million SOE workers were laid off in \n1998\u20132001.  Despite  the  corporatization  that  transformed  most  SOEs  into  limited  liability \ncompanies and about 1,000 SOEs being listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, \ncorporate governance standards of SOEs need substantial improvement. In 2002, the State \nEconomic and Trade Commission (SETC) and CSRC formulated codes of conduct for listed \nSOEs. No assessment has been made to verify the compliance of SOEs with these codes. \n \n13.  Rural  Finance.  The  rural  financial  system  comprises  a  policy  bank  (Agricultural \nDevelopment Bank of China), a commercial bank (Agricultural Bank of China), and the rural \ncredit cooperative (RCC) system. Over 28,000 RCCs account for 13% of deposits and 10% of \nloans of the banking sector, and 60% of agricultural loans. RCCs are controlled by various \nlevels  of  governments  to  channel  funds  to  SOEs,  township  and  village  enterprises  with \ngovernment connections, and government agencies such as the state grain bureaus. Rural \nhouseholds, especially those with low incomes, lack access to formal credit. Large numbers of \nrural households must turn to moneylenders, friends, or relatives in the informal credit market. \n \nB.  Trends in the PRC Banking Industry \n \n1.  Economic Growth Has Led to Growing Demand for Banking Products \n \n14.  The PRC\u2019s economy sustained strong growth in the past decade (see Appendix 1). This \neconomic growth has substantially increased per capita income. In particular, the per capita \nannual disposable income of urban households has risen significantly over the past 3 years. \nSuch growth will foster a growing demand for banking products and services. Loans by and \ndeposits with financial institutions have grown rapidly. Loans grew at a CAGR of 15.0% from \n1999 to 2004 (Table A4.1). The CAGR for deposits was 18.4% for the same period.  \n \nTable A3.1: Loan Growth \n \nYear on Year  Year on Year \nYear  Total Loans a  Total Deposits a \nGrowth  Growth \n  CNY billion  CNY (%)  CNY billion  CNY (%) \n1999  9,373    8.3  10,878  13.7 \n2000  9,937    6.0  12,380  13.8 \n2001  11,231  13.0  14,362  16.0 \n2002  13,129  16.9  17,092  19.0 \n2003  15,900  21.1  20,806  21.7 \n2004  18,857  18.6  25,319  21.7 \nCNY = yuan. \na Includes the loans or deposits of the People\u2019s Bank of China, the largest four commercial banks, joint-stock \ncommercial  banks,  rural  credit  cooperatives,  urban  commercial  banks,  financial  institutions  with  foreign \ninvestments, urban credit cooperatives, policy banks, financing companies, leasing companies and the PRC Post. \nSource: PBOC. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  23 \n2.  Corporate Lending and Growing Demand for Retail Banking Products \n \n15.  Corporate banking will remain the primary focus of the PRC banking industry in the near \nto midterm future, because of the sheer demand and growth potential. PRC corporations are the \ngrowth engine of the country\u2019s economic development. In the past, a large majority of loans by \nPRC financial institutions have been made to SOEs, a trend which will change as privatizations \nincrease. In addition, newly founded privately-owned corporations are becoming increasingly \nimportant borrowers.  \n \n16.  As the PRC banking industry has liberalized, banking institutions have been allowed to \noffer consumer lending products. Rising incomes are likely to foster growing consumer demand \nfor banking products and services. It is anticipated that retail banking will continue to grow, with \nincreasing demands for mortgages and other consumer loans. According to the National Bureau \nof Statistics, consumer loans in the PRC totaled CNY2.0 trillion in 2004, representing 10.5% of \ntotal loans and 14.6% of GDP, and grew at a compound annual growth rate of 36.5% from 2002 \nto 2004. \n \n17.  Mortgage loans represented the majority of overall consumer loans in 2003, and were \nfueled by the Government\u2019s efforts to reform the housing system, under which employees of \nSOEs previously received free or subsidized housing. Mortgage loans have grown rapidly from \nCNY609.9  billion  in  2001  to  over  CNY1.2  trillion  in  2003,  according  to  the  Ministry  of \nConstruction. \n \n18.  The vast majority of bank cards in the PRC are debit cards. There are approximately \n517,000 credit and points-of-sale and 67,000 automated teller machines (ATMs) in the PRC. \nThe credit card market has so far been limited for a variety of reasons, including the limited \nacceptance of cards by merchants, the underdevelopment of a national payment infrastructure, \nand the absence of a nationwide consumer credit information system. According to the PRC \nUnionpay, an electronic interbank information exchange and transaction network, at the end of \n2004, 815 million banking cards had been issued in the PRC, only 11 million of which were \ncredit cards. \n \nC.   PRC Nonperforming Loan Situation \n \n19.  Overview. As at the most recent PRC NPL report (Fitch, 30 May 2006) the total gross \nNPLs stand at $673 billion, broken down in these three categories: (i) total official NPLs on \nbanks\u2019 books of $206 billion, (ii) NPLs carved out from banks and currently residing in one of the \nfour  AMCs  at  $197  billion,  and  (iii)  potential  problem  loans  (i.e.  from  Fitch\u2019s  estimate \ndowngrading of \u201cSpecial Mention\u201d loans in PRC banks) of an additional $270 billion. Note that \nthis estimate is lower than that initially made by Ernst & Young (12 May 2006) which tallied total \nNPLs at $911 billion (including a very large \u201cpotential future amount\u201d), a figure that E&Y soon \nretracted as \u201cerroneous\u201d after official complaints by the People\u2019s Bank of China.

Improvements amidst Serious Problem. Fitch, and other analysts, acknowledges that \nwhile the NPL stock problem remains serious improvements have been achieved and estimated \nNPL burden on the PRC fiscal resource is not as dire as oftentimes predicted. Fitch states: \n\u201cGenerally, we conclude that although significant progress has been made in lowering the NPL \nburden of China\u2019s large, premier banks, outside of these select entities the improvement in \nasset quality has been less dramatic, and much work remains to be done at an institutional \nlevel. That said, the estimated costs of the remaining cleanup are not as burdensome as one \nmight think, particularly when considered in the context of the PRC\u2019s massive foreign exchange \nreserves (which topped $875 billion at end March) and fairly modest government debt.\u201d \n \nTable A3.3: Asset Quality Indicators 2002\u20132004 Weighted Average (by Total Assets) \n(%) \n                 \n  Big Four  JSCBsb \nItem  2005a  2004  2003  2002  2005  2004  2003  2002 \nNPLs/Total  11.7    14.1   25.4   30.2    2.6    3.6   6.6     9.9 \nLoans                 \nLLR/NPLs  50.5    32.3   17.2     6.8  101.5 70.4  66.0    49.9\nNet NPLs/Equity  \u2014  174.1  278.6  356.5    15.0 26.1  77.6  186.7\n  \u2014 = not available, LLR =  loan loss reserves, NPL = non-performing loan. \n  Note: Italicized figures exclude data on Agricultural Bank of China. \n  a Excludes Industrial & Commercial Bank of China. \n  b Excludes Everbright Bank and Guangdong Development Bank. \n  Source: Bank Financial statements. \n \nTable A3.4: Financial Support Measures \n     \nAmount \nDate  Recipient \n($ billion) \nCapital Injections     \n1998  33  Big 4 State-Owned Banks \nDec 2003  23  Bank of China (BOC) \nDec 2003  23  China Construction Bank (CCB) \nJun 2004    2  Bank of Communications (BOCOM) \nApr 2005  15  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) \n       Total   95   ", "  Appendix 3  25 \nAmount \nDate  Recipient \n($ billion) \n     \nNPL Carveoutsa     \n1999\u20132000  169  Big 4 Banks and China Development Bank \n2004    51  BOC, CCB and BOCOM \n2005    85  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) \n       Total  305   \nAMC = Asset Management Company, NPL = non-performing loan, PBOC = People\u2019s Bank of China.    \na   In 2005, a fifth AMC was created to assume NPLs from PBOC, but information on the size and nature of  \n    the loans transferred is not available. \n           Source: Fitch.  \n \n21.  Slow NPL Resolution. Despite the large stock of NPLs, the PRC NPL market (mainly \nGovernment controlled as most sellers of NPLs are state-owned banks or AMCs) have been \nslow in facilitating sizeable resolution transactions, particularly with regard to establishing a \npositive market attractive and clear for foreign funding and third-party distressed debt investors \nparticipation (i.e. not shuffling NPLs from one AMC to another AMC at accounting prices which \nmay not reflect actual expected recoveries from such transactions). In 2005, the total face value \nof large NPL deals was over CNY67 billion (approximately $8.5 billion) which is notable but still \nfar short of the hundreds of billions of $ worth of NPLs still languishing in the system. See table \nbelow for breakdown of major PRC NPL transactions in 2005. \n \nTable A3.5: Overview of China\u2019s Prominent NPL Transactions in 2005 \n       \nFace Value \nSeller  Branch  Buyer(s) \n(CNY billion) \nQingdao  Great Wall  6.66 \nCinda \nTianjin  Avenue Capital                5 \n16 branches   Huarong/Deutsche JV              14.5 \nHuarong  27 provinces  Silver Grant              36.44 \nXiamen  International Investors               1.7 \nOrient  Shandong  PPF Group  3.12 \nCNY = yuan. \nSource: Ernst & Young. \n \nD.  Summary: Main Credit Consideration \n \n22.  The outlook on PRC banking industry is positive and economic risk and industry risk \nhave improved. Although the system still faces some major challenges, government actions \ntaken in the past two years signify that industry reform is taking a major step forward. While the \nsector  is  still  characterized  by  ineffectual  corporate  governance,  weak  asset  quality,  low \nprofitability, and low capitalization, direct and indirect capital injections from the Government, \nand reform efforts by the banks themselves have helped the sector to improve its financial \nprofile. In addition, intensifying supervisory efforts by regulators are slowly shaping the industry. \nGiven time, these efforts are likely to lay a solid foundation for the sector to build on. However, \nfinancial sector reform in the PRC is still very much a work in progress, and setbacks along the \nroad  are  only  to  be  expected.  Positive  factors  to  take  into  consideration  are: (i)  a  strong \neconomy; (ii) government support; (iii) high level of commitment; (iv) improving ability to manage \neconomy; (v) strengthening regulatory oversight; (vi) strengthening corporate sector. \n \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \n23.  Negative factors to take into account are: (i) an improving but high level of problem \nassets. Recent cases of irregularities involving sizable amounts of funds have highlighted the \nfact that the sector still has a lot of work to do to strengthen its credit risk management and build \na solid credit culture across individual organizations, which are needed to further improve the \nsector\u2019s asset quality; (ii) insufficient capital. While recent capital injections and IPOs have \nhelped  a  few  Chinese  banks  to  strengthen  their  capitalization,  the  banking  system\u2019s \ncapitalization  is  still  inadequate  to  support  the  sector\u2019s  rapid  asset  growth  and  cover  its \ninadequate loan loss provisions; (iii) high information risk and high gearing in the corporate \nsector; disclosure standards and quality of information are still weak, though improving; and (iv) \nhigh domestic credit to GDP (while regulators are trying to rationalize domestic credit growth, \ndomestic credit continues to grow at a brisk pace. It reached 141% of GDP at the end of 2004 \ncompared with 148% at the end of 2003, 138% in 2002, 127% in 2001, and only 103% in 1997). \n \n \n \n ", "   \nTable A3.6: The People\u2019s Republic of China Banking Sector Market Dimensions (1995\u20132004) \n \n  Total  Corporate,  Total  of which:  Total  Excess  Govt  Corporate  Nominal  Nominal \nYear  Loans  Commercial  Consumer  Mortgages  Deposits  Deposits  Bonds  Bonds  GDP  GDP \n(CNY B)  Loans   Loans  (CNY B)  (CNY B)  (CNY B)  (CNY B)  (CNY B)  (CNY B)  Growth \n(CNY B)  (CNY B)  (%) \n1995  5,231.0  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  5,376     145    330   65    5,848  25.1 \n1996  6,310.0  \u2014  \u2014  \u2014  6,847     538    436   60    6,788  16.1 \n1997  7,358.5    7,341       17       13.0  8,212     853    551   52    7,446    9.7 \n1998  8,500.2    8,447       53       43.0  9,529  1,029    777   68    7,835    5.2 \n1999  9,558.7    9,394     164     136.0  10,831  1,273  1054   78    8,207    4.8 \n2000  10,876.3  10,453     424     332.0  13,486  2,610  1302   86    8,940    8.9 \n2001  11,899.0  11,200     699     560.0  15,472  3,573  1562  101    9,593    7.3 \n2002  13,980.0  12,913  1,067     825.8  18,339  4,359  \u2014  \u2014  10,479    9.2 \n2003  16,977.0  15,401  1,576  1,330.2  22,036  5,059  \u2014  \u2014  11,669  11.4 \n2004  19,422.0  16,848  1,988  1,580.0  25,319  5,897  \u2014  \u2014  13,657  17.0 \n\u2014 = not available, B = billion, CNY = yuan, GDP = gross domestic product.  \n      Sources: China Banking Regulatory Commission, People\u2019s Bank of China, and Goldman Sachs research estimates. \n \nTable A3.7: The People\u2019s Republic of China Banking Sector Market Dimensions as Percent of GDP \n \n  Total  Corporate,  Consumer  Mortgages  Deposits   Excess  Govt.

The development impact assessment of a financial institution (FI), including HZCCB, \nbegins by acknowledging the well-established thesis that a healthy financial sector, populated \nby  healthy  financial  institutions,  promotes  sustainable  economic  growth,  helps  generate \nemployment, and ultimately reduces poverty. Therefore, the ability of an FI, in this case HZCCB, \nto positively impact development depends on various indicators of its \u201chealthiness\u201d, through \nboth  qualitative  and  quantitative
