Background  \n \n3.  The Government of Karnataka (GOK) state is currently developing public mass transit \nsystems for Bengaluru city, including expansion of the metro rail and introduction of suburban rail. \nIn addition, the GOK is upgrading the existing bus transport system to enable a shift toward more \nsustainable modes. As part of this initiative, the Government of India (GOI) requested ADB for \nfinancial assistance for the construction of new metro lines, phases 2A and 2B, with a total length \nof 56 kilometers (km), including 30 stations and three depots. Phase 2B of the metro will connect \nthe city with the Kempegowda (Bengaluru) International Airport, while phase 2A will provide \ninterconnectivity with other metro lines at two junction stations along the Outer Ring Road (ORR). \nThe total project cost is estimated at $1,055.8 million. Expected outcomes of the project are (i) \nstrategic shift toward low carbon transport modes to meet mobility needs of the city through the \ncreation of an integrated, safe, reliable, efficient, affordable, inclusive, and environment-friendly \npublic transport system; (ii) empowerment of women and other vulnerable groups including the \nelderly and differently abled persons through safe, convenient, and equitable access to the \nbenefits of public transport; and (iii) enhancement of livability and economic productivity of the \ncity of Bengaluru. \n \n4.  The GOK also plans to prioritize (i) integrated and systemic urban planning to manage \ngrowth, catalyze strategic renewal of the city core, and enhance competitiveness, sustainability, \nand inclusiveness of the city; (ii) creation of a ridership base that improves the economic and \nfinancial viability of mass transit investment; (iii) accessibility benefits of a comprehensive public \ntransport system for all city residents; (iv) using land as a revenue source to finance long-term \ninvestment  needs  of  the  city;  and  (v)  addressing  complex  and  intertwined  economic  and \ntechnological needs. To meet these objectives, the GOK has requested technical assistance \nsupport from ADB for the following: \n \n(i)  Transit-oriented development (TOD) vision plan for the study corridors and \nTOD-based urban development plans for selected six zones prepared, and \nTOD implementation framework adopted. TOD can help maximize the potential \nof areas along mass transit corridors to accommodate projected city growth and to \nenhance  economic  productivity  of  the  city,  through  strategic  renewal  and \ndensification. TOD, an urban planning tool, will help realign growth and densities \nalong these new mass transit corridors through the creation of higher density, \nmixed-use, mixed income, resource-efficient neighborhoods that are (a) safe, \ncompact, resilient, and inclusive, and designed for effective disease containment \nand cure; and (b) reduction in the city\u2019s carbon footprint. In addition, this approach \nwill help enhance land values along the corridor and generate capital revenues to \nmeet long-term investment needs of the city. \n \n(ii)  Multimodal  integration  (MMI)  plan  covering  physical,  information, \noperational, and institutional integration and integrated ticketing prepared \nand institutionalized. MMI across four key pillars of integration\u2014(i) physical, (ii) \ninformation, (iii) operational, (iv) institutional\u2014and integrated ticketing will provide \nseamless, convenient, and affordable route and mode choices to all citizens. This \nwill  make  mobility  more  efficient,  safe,  affordable,  and  accessible  for  all, \nempowering  women  and  differently  abled  persons  to  move  and  access \nopportunities and amenities across the city with greater ease and confidence.  \n \n \n ", "3 \n \n(iii)  Capacity of line agencies for planning and implementation of TOD and MMI \nenhanced and community awareness program prepared and implemented. \nWhile TOD and MMI are fast gaining ground in India due to the substantial merits \nthey bring, these concepts are complex to plan and design, and to eventually \nimplement and manage. Capacity building of the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation \nLimited (BMRCL), the Directorate of Urban Land Transport (DULT), and other \nparastatals shall enable them to successfully plan and implement TOD and MMI \nwith efficacy and technical knowhow.  \n \n5.  The TOD and physical MMI components of this assignment will be undertaken for the \nstudy area defined by a 2 km continuous corridor on either side of the metro alignment including \nall stations of phases 2A and 2B. For all the components of MMI excluding physical, the study will \ncover areas/systems beyond the defined corridor, as required.  \n \n6.  To facilitate the preparation and effective on-ground implementation of the technical \nassistance (TA) and to make the planning process demand-driven and evidence-based, ADB is \nsupporting BMRCL and DULT in preparatory activities for the TA, which include (i) setting up a \nrelevant database so that the TA is founded on high quality robust analytics; (ii) formulating an \nintegrated regulatory framework to harmonize conflicts within the existing policies and plans and \nto create conditions for successful TOD implementation by minimizing inherent ambiguities and \ninconsistencies; (iii) developing pilot concept plans for physical MMI for seven proposed stations \nto demonstrate tangible benefits of convenient intermodal connections and barrier-free access for \nall; (iv) devising a strategy for integrated service and financial planning for the city public bus \ntransport agency, to ensure the readjusted travel demand generated in the context of the \nupcoming mass rapid transit system is met; and (v) organizing sensitization workshops for \ndecision  makers,  capacity  building  programs,  and  exposure  visit  for  operational  staff  of \nparastatals, to enhance skill and to create conditions of ownership. \n \nC.  Objectives \n \n7.  The main objective of this assignment is to help BMRCL and DULT ensure that (i) transit-\noriented development is planned and delivered along the identified metro corridors to set new \nbenchmarks  for  sustainable,  inclusive  growth,  and  restructuring  of  the  city;  (ii)  physical \ninfrastructure and operational (service and financial) improvements are planned for all public \ntransport (PT), intermediate public transport (IPT), and non-motorized transport (NMT) to enable \nan effective modal shift toward low carbon modes while ensuring social inclusiveness through \nequitable access to the urban transport system for all users irrespective of gender, age, and \nsocioeconomic profile; and (iii) capacity building for state agencies is undertaken such that the \nplanning, design, and implementation of related projects can be led successfully and efficiently, \nand conditions of ownership and commitment can be created for a lasting legacy. \n \n8.  Specific objectives are as follows: \n \n(i)  To plan and incentivize TOD as a tool to realign densities and accommodate \ngrowth along mass transit corridors to reverse Bengaluru\u2019s urban sprawl and \nenable renewal of the city core, while safeguarding public health and addressing \nspecific micro development characteristics of each TOD zone within the corridor. \nIn doing so, enable the following: \n \n \n \n \n ", "4 \n \n(a)  Strategic urban renewal of overburdened parts of the city core and \ndensification,  urban  restructuring,  and  design  of  underutilized \ndeveloped areas to sustainably manage planned city growth.
