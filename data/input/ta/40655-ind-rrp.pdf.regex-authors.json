IIFCL shall ensure that for each \nAssessment  subproject, initial environmental examination, environmental impact \nassessment,  and  the  environmental  management  plan,  as \napplicable, are submitted to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \nreview  and  approval  before  submission  of  a  Periodic  Financing \nRequest (PFR). An environmental and social safeguards framework \n(ESSF)  has  been  developed  (Appendix  10)  to  guide  the \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguards  assessment  of  subprojects \nduring implementation of the Investment Program.  \n   \nInvestment Program   The  Investment  Program  supports  the  \u201cScheme  for  Financing \nDescription   Viable  Infrastructure  Projects  through  the  India  Infrastructure \nFinance  Company  Limited\u201d  (the  Scheme)  for  promoting \ninfrastructure  development  through  public-private  partnerships \n(PPPs). Pursuant to its Scheme (Appendix 3), IIFCL will provide \nlong-term debt financing at commercial rates for stand-alone non-\nrecourse infrastructure subprojects. IIFCL will prioritize the financing \nof PPP subprojects selected through transparent and competitive \nbidding process and assessed for commercial viability. IIFCL will \nfinance subprojects only as a member of lending consortium where \nits total lending to any subproject will not exceed 20% of the total \ncapital cost for the subproject. \n   \nMultitranche  IIFCL,  through  the  Government  of  India  (the  Government)  has \nFinancing Facility  requested ADB for financing the Investment  Program through a \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF). The MFF, amounting to $500 \nmillion  over  4  years  (FY2007-FY2011),  will  finance  eligible \nsubprojects  that  are  in  accordance  with  the  Scheme,  and  the \nagreed  criteria.  The  Facility  will  consist  multiple  tranches.  Each \ntranche will be for not less than $100 million. \n   \nRationale   Poor infrastructure is India\u2019s \u201cAchilles\u2019 heel\u201d which is estimated to \n  cost India 3\u20134% of lost gross domestic product (GDP) a year. India \n  needs to increase its spending on infrastructure from 4\u20135% to 9% of \n  GDP  to  achieve  the  growth  projection  of  9%  during  the  11th \n  (FY2007\u2013FY2012)  Five-Year  Plan  (FYP).  With  higher  growth ", "ii   \n  targets and a rising population, even maintaining current levels of \n  infrastructure will require a staggering increase in investment. The \n  total investment required is estimated at about $475 billion during \n  the 11th FYP.  \n \nPublic sector has been the main provider of infrastructure in India. \nHowever, public financing alone will not be able to generate the \nneeded  level  of  investment  ($475  billion).  Accordingly,  the \nGovernment\u2019s  priorities  for  bridging  the  infrastructure  deficit \nincludes (i) revising policies and regulations for enhancing private \nsector participation (PSP) in infrastructure development including \nthrough  PPPs,  (ii)  strengthening  the  capacity  at  all  levels  for \npromoting PPPs, and (iii) enabling arrangements for bridging the \nenormous deficit in infrastructure financing especially for long-term \nfunds through all possible sources. Corresponding reform measures \nare underway.  \nInfrastructure  sector  reforms  are  enhancing  the  enabling \nenvironment and encouraging participation of PSP from domestic \nand international sources. In addition, significant efforts are ongoing \nfor mainstreaming PPPs in the states and in central line ministries. \nWhile  a  paradigm  shift  from  public  financing  to  PPP  modality \nrequires  time,  these  measures  have  already  facilitated  the \napplication of PPP modality in sectors such as road and power.  \nIndia has also witnessed a visible shift in financial sector policies \nsince  the  1990s.  The  reform  measures  have  led  to  increased \nallocative  efficiency  of  the  financial  system  brought  about  by  a \nreduction  in  intermediation  costs,  enhanced  competition,  and \nincreased diversity of products and services. Notwithstanding these, \nthe infrastructure finance market in India is largely characterized \nwith  inadequate  flow  of  long-term  funds.  In  this  context,  the \nGovernment is pursuing reforms in contractual savings (pensions \nand insurance) and the corporate debt market.  \nConsidering  several  interlocking  factors  including  policy  and \nregulatory inadequacies in infrastructure and financial sectors, the \nimpact of the ongoing reforms will only be felt over the medium- to \nlong-term  and  as  a  result,  the  already  significant  gap  in \ninfrastructure financing will further increase. These concerns were \nextensively  discussed  within  the  Government  as  well  as  with \nfinancial market experts and international institutions for framing \ninnovative responses consistent with the PSP and PPP agenda.  \n \n  Among the options, establishing IIFCL to provide the much needed \nlong-term debt at commercial terms specifically for promoting PPPs \nwas considered important in view of the limited availability of long-\nterm debt for infrastructure financing. Central to the Government\u2019s \nPPP development strategy, IIFCL\u2019s operating paradigm is guided by \nthe  Scheme  approved  by  the  Government\u2019s  Committee  on \nInfrastructure chaired by the prime minister. ", "  iii\nThe Government has also designated IIFCL as the debt manager of \na $3 billion debt fund of the $5 billion India Infrastructure Financing \nInitiative. IIFCL, in partnership with Blackstone Group, CitiGroup, \nand Infrastructure Development Finance Company are the initial \ninvestors in the $2 billion equity fund of the India Infrastructure \nFinancing Initiative. Further, IIFCL and 3i Group plc. have entered \ninto a strategic partnership for equity and long-term debt financing \nfor projects in power, port, airport, and road sectors. IIFCL is also \nexpected to be the lead agency for utilizing India\u2019s foreign exchange \nreserves for infrastructure financing. For this purpose, IIFCL is likely \nto establish two offshore special purpose vehicles.  \n \nThe  proposed  India  Infrastructure  Project  Financing  Facility  (the \nFacility)  will  directly  support  the  Government\u2019s  infrastructure \ndevelopment  agenda  by  enhancing  the  availability  of  the  much \nneeded  long-term  funds  for  infrastructure  financing.  With  ADB\u2019s \nassistance  through  the  Facility,  IIFCL  will  provide  funds  at \ncommercial  terms  with  over  20-years  maturity  for  infrastructure \nsubprojects which is currently not being provided by the market.  \n \nThe Facility is an integral part of the ADB\u2019s sector strategy and \ncomplements  ADB\u2019s  parallel  initiatives  in  contractual  savings, \ncorporate  bonds,  PPPs,  and  infrastructure  development,  all  of \nwhich  contribute  to  creating  an  enabling  environment  for \ninfrastructure development in India.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  It is estimated that the $500 million Facility will help catalyze an \n  investment of $2.5 billion\u2013$3.5 billion from the private sector for \nfinancing  PPP  subprojects.  The  success  of  the  Facility  in \nestablishing  a  framework  for  implementing  the  Scheme  could \ntrigger substantial investments considering the convergence that \nwill emerge as a result of the (i) expected support from the World \nBank, Japan Bank for International Cooperation, and Kreditanstalt \nf\u00fcr Wiederaufbau; (ii) commitments from international private equity \nsources including 3i Group plc., Blackstone Group, and CitiGroup; \nand (iii) the synergies envisaged from the proposed offshore special \npurpose vehicles for utilizing India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves for \ninfrastructure financing. \n   \n  The  Facility  will  result  in  infrastructure  development  through \nincreased PSP, thereby promoting economic efficiency and growth \nand reducing poverty. This is expected to have a multiplier effect on \nthe  infrastructure  sectors  as  well  as  on  the  broader  economy. \nEnhanced  PSP  through  PPPs  will  contribute  to  containing  and \neventually reducing fiscal deficit. The Facility is also expected to \nstrengthen  the  institutional  capacity  of  IIFCL  in  credit  risk \nmanagement and project risk appraisal.  \n   \nInvestment Program   The Investment Program of IIFCL is estimated to cost $6.0 billion. \nOf which, IIFCL is expected to raise $3.0 billion (or 50%) from the \ndomestic  market  including  insurance,  pension  funds,  and  the \n ", "iv   \nNational Savings Scheme, and the balance of $3 billion (or 50%) \nfrom  international  capital  markets  and  bilateral  and  multilateral \nsources including the Facility.  \n \nFinancing Plan  The proposed Facility of $500 million will capture 8.34% of the total \nfinancing plan. \n   \n  India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited \nFinancing Plan to FY2007\u2013FY2011 \n($ million) \nItem  Amount  % \nAsian Development Bank  500  8.34 \nLocal Market Borrowing  3,000  50.00 \nForeign Borrowing  2,500  41.66 \n      Total  6,000  100.00 \n      FY = fiscal year \n      Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n   \nFacility Amount and  A $500 million lending facility will be provided to IIFCL under a \nTerms  MFF,  with  multiple  tranches  at  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the loan and guarantee agreements. IIFCL has provided ADB \nwith (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-\nbased lending facility on the basis of these terms and conditions; \nand (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent \ndecision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom ADB.  \n \nIndia will provide a sovereign guarantee, in form and substance \nacceptable  to  ADB,  for  the  term  of  each  loan  as  a  condition \nprecedent to the effectiveness of each tranche requested by IIFCL \nand  provided  by  ADB  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  each  loan \nagreement. \n   \nSubloan Terms  IIFCL will onlend funds received through the Facility (via subloans) \nto  eligible  subprojects  on  commercial  terms  based  on  an \nindependent assessment of subproject risk. The eligibility of the \nsubprojects will be assessed in terms of compliance with ESSF, the \nconditions of the Scheme, and additional criteria agreed with the \nBorrower. The onlending to an eligible subproject will be preceded \nby an upfront evaluation of subprojects to ensure compliance with \nthe  ESSF  to  ensure  that  all  subprojects  financed  through  the \nFacility comply with ADB safeguard requirements.     \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  The  Facility  will  be  available  for  a  4-year  disbursement  period \n(FY2007\u2013FY2011). The last date on which any disbursement under \nany tranche will be 30 November 2011. The last PFR will have to be \nsubmitted no later than 1 November 2010. \n   \n \n ", "  v\nSubproject and  Each  subproject  and  subborrower  shall  satisfy  at  all  times  the \nSubborrower  subproject  and  subborrower  selection  criteria  as  set  out  in  the \nSelection Criteria  Scheme  which  includes,  inter  alia,  appraisal  for  technical, \neconomic, and commercial viability. In addition, each subborrower \nshall  (i)  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time);  (ii)  have \nadequate resources and financial capability to raise resources to \ncomplete and operate the relevant qualified subproject successfully; \n(iii) not be in default on any prior loan to any participating members \nof the consortium including IIFCL; (iv) be able to provide security as \nrequired  by  the  consortium  of  lenders;  (v)  maintain  appropriate \nfinancial record of income and expenditure to the satisfaction of \nADB and IIFCL; and (vi) comply with ADB\u2019s and national and state \npolicies,  and  laws  and  regulations  relating  to  environment, \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples.    \n   \nImplementation  IIFCL will be the Executing Agency of the proposed Facility, while \nArrangements  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)-Department  of  Economic  Affairs \n(DEA) will be the Executing Agency for the technical assistance \n(TA) grant. IIFCL\u2019s Board of Directors will provide policy direction \nand strategic oversight for the Facility. A project management unit \n(PMU) will be established by IIFCL to monitor, screen, and select \nsubprojects  in  consultation  with  the  consortium  of  lenders  and \noversee day-to-day implementation.  \nThe PMU will be supported by specialists with expertise in risk \nmanagement and project advisory work. A senior officer, reporting \ndirectly  to  IIFCL\u2019s  Chairman,  will  be  appointed  for  ensuring \ncompliance with the ESSF. The PMU will also have a dedicated \nfinance  and  accounts  officer  to  monitor  project  accounts  and \nprocess claims. The PMU will report to ADB on implementation \nprogress.  \n   \nProcurement and   All goods and services financed by the Facility will be carried out in \nDisbursement  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time). The individual loan proceeds will be \ndisbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). An imprest account will be \nestablished in a current account with a commercial bank acceptable \nto ADB. The initial amount to be deposited and to be maintained in \nthe imprest account shall not exceed the lower of (i) the estimated \nexpenditure  for  the  first  6  months  of  implementation,  or  (ii)  the \nequivalent of 10% of the tranche. \n   \nFramework Financing  IIFCL  and  the  India  have  entered  into  a  framework  financing \nAgreement  agreement (FFA) with ADB. The FFA satisfies the requirements \nestablished in Appendix 4 of the ADB document Innovation and \nEfficiency Initiative: Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities. \n \nThe  FFA  records  the  full  set  of  assurances,  warranties  and \nrepresentations  on  crosscutting  themes,  covering  safeguards, \n ", "vi   \ngovernance,  anticorruption,  financial  management,  procurement, \nand disbursement and subproject selection. \n  Before  ADB  accepts  the  PFR,  India  and  IIFCL  will  ensure  full \ncompliance with the terms and conditions of the FFA.  \n   \nPeriodic Financing  The MFF transaction is accompanied by a PFR (PFR1), received \nRequest  from the borrower, for the first tranche amounting to $300 million.  \n \nPFR  1  lists  24  potential  subprojects,  some  of  which  will  be \nearmarked for ADB financing. The subprojects are all in the road \nsector and are overwhelmingly under National Highway Authority of \nIndia. The total cost of the subprojects is about $3.32 billion, of \nwhich IIFCL's exposure will be about $500 million ($20 million\u2013$30 \nmillion exposure per subproject on average).  \n   \nRetroactive Financing  Retroactive financing may be possible under individual loans for \nexpenditures incurred up to 12 months before the signing of the \ncorresponding loan agreement, with a ceiling of 20% of the loan \namount.  The  Government  and  IIFCL  have  been  informed  that \napproval of advance procurement and retroactive financing does \nnot commit ADB to financing any of the proposed subprojects. Each \nPFR will specify the nature of financing if retroactive financing is \nrequested.    \n   \nTechnical Assistance  A TA for an amount of $500,000 is attached to the Facility for (i) \nsupporting capacity development within IIFCL for managing market \nand  credit  risks;  and  (ii)  training  IIFCL  staff  in  subproject  risk \nappraisal, management, and mitigation.  \nAn  ongoing  TA  is  building  in-house  capacity  to  ensure  that \nsubprojects financed by IIFCL adhere to the ESSF. This TA also \nsupported the rating of IIFCL by an international rating agency for \nfacilitating IIFCL\u2019s entry into the international markets.  \n \nProject Benefits  At  the  macro  level,  the  Facility  will  help  catalyze  private  sector \n  investments for infrastructure development which will help contain \nand reduce the fiscal deficit at all levels. Financial closure of 64 \nsubprojects  sanctioned  by  IIFCL  as  of  end  September  2007  is \nexpected to catalyze nearly $25 billion in investments, of which the \nFacility  will  help  catalyze  nearly  $2.5\u2013$3.5  billion.  The  credit \nenhancing  function  of  the  Government\u2019s  guarantee  for  IIFCL \nborrowings will also help channel latent sources of funds such as \ninsurance and pension funds for infrastructure development. \n \nAt the institutional level, IIFCL is designed to provide innovative \nfinancing  options  for  supporting  heterogeneous  infrastructure \ndelivery  models  by  integrating  a  range  of  financing  instruments \n(equity,  debt,  and  guarantee)  and  financing  sources  (domestic \nmarkets,  multilateral  sources,  international  equity,  domestic  and \ninternational borrowings). In the process, IIFCL will also be able to \nleverage core competences of promoters and project development ", "  vii\nagencies (including newly created PPP Cells in selected states and \ncentral line ministries) for building a shelf of PPP subprojects.  \nThe  Facility  will  have  a  direct  impact  on  poverty  reduction  by \nincreasing  farm  and  non-farm  productivity.  Empirical  evidence \nsuggests that that poverty incidence falls by 0.33% for every 1% \ngrowth in provincial GDP. Investment in infrastructure as a whole \nand  on  roads  and  transportation  in  particular  has  a  direct \ncontribution to this linkage by (i) reducing transactions costs; (ii) \nenabling economic agents like individuals, firms, and governments \nrespond efficiently to demand; (iii) lowering costs of inputs used in \nproduction; (iv) opening up new opportunities for entrepreneurs; (v) \ncreating  employment  especially  in  public  works  both  as  social \nprotection and as a counter-cyclical policy in times of recession; \nand (vi) enhancing human capital by improving access to health \nand education. \nRisks and  The  envisaged  benefits  depend  on  effective  demand,  IIFCL\u2019s \nAssumptions  institutional  capacity,  and  the  progress  of  the  ongoing  real  and \n  financial sector reforms.  \nWhile PPP is emerging as the preferred mode for infrastructure \ndevelopment, capacity constraints will have to be addressed for \ntransforming  the  potential  for  PPPs  into  a  stream  of  bankable \nsubprojects. This risk is being dealt by intensive support from ADB \nand  other  development  partners  for  mainstreaming  PPPs.  In \naddition, upfront identification of potential subprojects for the first \nPFR of the Facility has been made. \nThe ability of IIFCL to leverage government guarantee to generate \nlow cost and longer tenor funds is critical for its catalytic role. This \nalso depends on the market perception of the quality of IIFCL\u2019s \npipeline,  credit  appraisal  and  disbursement  procedures,  risk \nmanagement  and  appraisal  systems,  environment  and  social \nsafeguard  compliance  procedures,  and  operational  efficiency. \nFactors that mitigate these risks include (i) intensive appraisal of the \nsubprojects  by  IIFCL;  (ii)  the  emphasis  of  the  Scheme  on \ncommitment  to  operational  autonomy,  good  governance,  and \ncommercial  orientation;  and  (iii)  ongoing  ADB  and  World  Bank \nsupport to IIFCL for enhancing systems and procedures and human \nresource development. IIFCL will maintain a lean organization of \ncore specialists for reducing cost overheads. Further, international \ncredit rating required for accessing international capital markets will \nrequire IIFCL to adopt and maintain international best practices in \ncorporate governance and financial management. \nAdverse impact of drop in the momentum of mainstreaming PPPs \nhas been mitigated at the macro level through positive incentives by \nthe  Government  for  enhancing  the  bankability  of  infrastructure \nsubprojects. In addition, state governments are proactively reducing \nconstraints to infrastructure development for promoting economic \ngrowth. \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL), to \nbe guaranteed by India, for the India Infrastructure Project Financing Facility (the Facility). The \nreport also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for capacity development of IIFCL \nand, if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA. The design and monitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1. \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Sector Performance and Investment Requirements \n2.  The  Indian  economy  expanded  significantly  in  fiscal  year  (FY)2006.  According  to \nadvance estimates released by the Central Statistical Organization on 7 February 2007, the \neconomy recorded a gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate (at factor cost) of 9.2% at \nconstant (FY1999) prices, compared with 9% in the previous year. The increase in growth rates \nin recent years is reflected in the 11th (FY2007\u2013FY2012) Five-Year Plan (FYP) average annual \ngrowth target of 9% compared with the 10th FYP target of 8%. \n3.  High quality infrastructure is essential to harness the growth impulses in the economy. \nThe Planning Commission has observed that poor infrastructure is India\u2019s \u201cAchilles\u2019 heel\u201d which \nis estimated to cost India 3\u22124% of lost GDP a year. The Planning Commission has estimated \nthat India needs to increase its spending on infrastructure from 4\u20135% to 9% of GDP if it is to \nachieve its growth targets.1 Table 1 provides a comparison of India\u2019s infrastructure availability. \n Table 1: Comparison of Infrastructure Availability in India  \nNational  Electricity \nPopulation  Expressways  Major  Production  Port Shipments \nItem  (million)  (\u2018000 miles)  Airports  (billion of kWh)  (billion tons) \nIndia  1,100  3.7  17  652  0.4 \nPRC  1,300  25.0  56  2,500  2.9 \nUnited States   300  47.0  189  4.000  1.4 \nkWh = kilowatt-hour, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China. \nSources: International Monetary Fund, United States Energy Information Administration, Morgan Stanley, China \nNational Development and Reform Commission, and National Council of Applied Economic Research (India).   \n4.  With  higher  growth  targets  and  a  rising  population,  maintaining  current  levels  of \ninfrastructure will require a staggering increase in investment. The total investment required is \nestimated at about Rs18,634 billion ($475 billion) during the 11th FYP by the Committee on \nInfrastructure  headed  by  the  prime  minister.  The  estimated  financing  needs  for  major \ninfrastructure subsectors during the 11th FYP include $50 billion\u2013$60 billion for roads, $15.5 \nbillion for seaports, $200 billion for power (over the next 7 years), $10.9 billion for civil aviation, \nand $89.21 billion (over the next 7 years) for railways. A detailed sector analysis is in Appendix \n2. \n                                                 \n1  Chile, for example, is estimated to have spent about 7% of its GDP in 2006 on infrastructure while the estimated \nfigure for the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China is 9%.  ", "2   \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities  \n \n5.  Public sector has been the main provider of basic infrastructure in India. However, public \nfinancing\u2014already limited by the deficit reduction provisions of the Fiscal Responsibility and \nBudget Management (FRBM) Act 20032\u2014will not alone be able to generate the needed levels \nof investments ($475 billion) to improve infrastructure facilities. According to the 11th FYP, the \ntargeted average GDP growth rate of 9% during FY2007\u2013FY2012 requires an increase in \nprivate investment for infrastructure from the historical average of 6.5% per year to nearly \n12.0% per year.  Accordingly, the strategy of the Government for bridging the infrastructure \ndeficit includes (i) revising policies and regulations across sectors for enhancing private sector \nparticipation (PSP) in infrastructure development including through public-private partnerships \n(PPPs);3 (ii) enabling arrangements for bridging the enormous deficit in infrastructure financing \nespecially for long-term funds through all possible sources; and (iii) strengthening the capacity \nat all levels for promoting PPPs for infrastructure development. The Government expects the \nshares  of  public  and  private  investment  through  PSP  including  PPP  in  total  infrastructure \ninvestment during the 11th FYP to be 70% and 30% respectively, compared to 83% and 17% \nrespectively during the 10th FYP. Financing from multilateral and bilateral institutions during the \n11th FYP are expected at around $40 billion to supplement resources raised in domestic and \ninternational markets. While the Government has pursued reforms for establishing a framework \nconducive for infrastructure development and broadening the range of financing modalities, \nsignificant scaling up of infrastructure investments still faces formidable challenges in the real \nand financial sectors. \n1.  Public-Private Partnership  \n6.  Recognizing the significance of the role of private sector in infrastructure development, \nthe Government has placed PSP and PPPs at the center of its infrastructure development \nstrategy. The Government\u2019s framework and measures for promoting PPPs draw on international \nexperience with appropriate adaptations to the Indian context4 include the following.  \n(i)  Establishing a PPP cell in the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) in the \nMinistry of Finance for coordinating the mainstreaming of PPPs nationwide.  \n(ii)  Institutionalizing  PPP  Cells  in  selected  states  and  central  line  ministries  for \nidentifying and developing potential PPP opportunities, developing PPP projects, \nand bringing them to market for financial closure.   \n(iii)  Establishing India Infrastructure Project Development Fund for financing PPP \nproject preparation activities such as conduct of feasibility studies. \n(iv)  Establishing the IIFCL, the executing agency (EA) for the proposed Facility, for \nfacilitating access to long-term funds for infrastructure development.   \n(v)  Launching the Viability Gap Fund with a current annual allocation of about $340 \nmillion for encouraging PPPs.5  \n                                                 \n2  The FRBM Act, 2003 requires the Government to reduce the fiscal deficit by a minimum of 0.3% of GDP and the \nrevenue deficit by 0.5% of GDP each year so that the fiscal deficit is reduced to 3% of GDP by March 2009. \n3  PPP projects are typically projects developed, implemented, and operated by bidders (stand-alone special purpose \nvehicles) where the private sector owns majority stake. Further, these projects have been selected on the basis of \na competitive and transparent bidding arrangement and expected to build and operate infrastructure based on a \nconcession with the Government.  \n4  See www.infrastructure.gov.in and www.pppinindia.com.   \n5  The Viability Gap Fund can provide catalytic assistance of up to 20% of the capital costs, through which it expects \nseveral projects to become bankable, attract private capital, and mobilize private sector efficiencies. This support is \nespecially important for regions and sectors where PPPs are difficult. ", "  3\n7.  Gaps in technical and management capabilities and in identifying market opportunities \nindicate  that  state  governments  and  central  line  ministries  have  not  yet  fully  grasped  the \npotential  of  infrastructure  development  through  PPPs.  Accordingly,  in  catalyzing  the  PPP \nmodality for infrastructure development, the DEA has emphasized awareness and capacity \nbuilding for changing the values developed over decades of implementing public sector projects. \nWhile it will be some time before PPP modality is well anchored in the working of the state \ngovernments and central line ministries, it is encouraging to note that transport (road) and \npower (generation and transmission) sectors are already applying PPP modality and have \ngenerated a shelf of bankable PPP projects. PPP opportunities have been noted in the urban \nsector including urban mass transit. The Government is also emphasizing application of PPP \nmodality in the health and education sectors.  \n2.  Infrastructure Sector Reforms  \n8.  The Government recognizes its important and expanded role in the changing economic \nand technological context for catalyzing PSP and PPPs in infrastructure development through (i) \ndeveloping legal and regulatory frameworks and arrangements, (ii) planning and coordination, \n(iii) reforming institutions and developing partnerships among complementary institutions, and \n(iv) ensuring quality of infrastructure. In pursuit of these, policy actions have been taken across \nsectors to encourage PSP, both through direct PSP and PPPs. These reforms are designed to \nreduce risks by enhancing the enabling environment, provide stability to long-term cash flows \nand assist in project appraisal to facilitate financing. Table 2 below summarizes the major \ninfrastructure sector reforms (Appendix 2). \nTable 2: Major Infrastructure Sector Reforms \n \nRoads  \u2022 Model concession agreement for toll highways has been published. \n\u2022 The National Highways Act, 1956, has been amended to attract private investment in \nroad development, maintenance, and operation. \nSeaports  \u2022 A comprehensive national maritime policy is being formulated to establish the vision \nand strategy for the sector until FY2024. \n\u2022 Private  sector  participation  including  foreign  direct  investment  in  ports  is  being \nencouraged. \n\u2022 Establishment of tariff authority for major ports to regulate port tariffs. \nAirports   \u2022 Major airports are being built or upgraded through PPPs. \n\u2022 The process of building 35 smaller city airports using PPPs has been initiated. \n\u2022 100% equity ownership by non-resident Indians is permitted in airports. \n\u2022 The Airports Authority of India Act has been amended to provide a legal framework \nfor airport privatization. \n\u2022 A new civil aviation policy has been tabled in the parliament proposing foreign direct \ninvestment of up to 74% in domestic carriers. \nUrban   \u2022 A model municipal law has been developed to help states and urban local bodies \nInfrastructure   enact reform legislation and to facilitate the development and disposal of excess land. \n\u2022 The Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 has been repealed. \nRailways   \u2022 Innovative pricing structures are being adopted for attracting new customers. \n\u2022 PPP-type  initiatives  are  being  considered  for  increasing  capacity  through  the \nproposed dedicated freight corridors. \nPower  \u2022 The Electricity Act, 2003 and the National Electricity Policy, 2005 have been designed \nto  facilitate  competition,  reduce  technical  and  commercial  losses,  and  provide \nremunerative returns on investments. \n\u2022 The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and 18 state electricity regulatory \ncommissions have been established to regulate tariffs. \n FY = fiscal year, PPP = public-private partnership. \n Sources: Planning Commission, National Highways Authority of India, and Ministry of Power.  \n ", "4   \n9.  The DEA\u2019s lead role in mainstreaming PPPs (paras. 6\u20137) is facilitating coordination and \nsequencing of reforms for realizing intersectoral synergies. Further initiatives underway include \n(i)  setting  up  state-level  policy  frameworks  for  enhancing  PSP  in  roads  and  developing  a \nmechanism for sharing traffic risk through annuity models and guarantees; (ii) developing a \nmodel concession agreement (MCA) setting out terms for PPPs for freight terminals, logistics \nparks, warehouses, and inland container depots, in railway operations; (iii) setting up an Airport \nEconomic  Regulatory  Authority  to  determine  capital  expenditure  needs,  check  monopolies, \nprescribe  standards,  and  to  set  up  a  dispute  resolution  mechanism;  (iv)  increasing  the \nconcession period in ports; and (v) unbundling and financial restructuring of power utilities, \nimplementation of availability-based tariff, setting up state electricity regulatory commissions, \nand issuing open access guidelines. \n3.  Infrastructure Financing  \n \n10.  The infrastructure finance market in India is largely characterized with inadequate flow of \nlong-term funds despite a large and diversified financial sector.6 The tenor of available funds \nfrom the domestic market is typically 10 years or less with a 2\u20133 year re-set clause, effectively \nmaking such funding short-term. This typically leads to front-loading of tariffs during the initial \nyears of the project cycle which adversely affects affordability of the services for the low income \nend-users. Since user tariffs are required to provide for debt repayments, return on equity, and \ndepreciation costs, tariff affordability depends on amortizing debt through smaller repayments \nover a longer period of time. In the absence of long-term fixed rate financing, stability of cash-\nflows  are  difficult  to  achieve.  Table  3  summarizes  the  available  financing  sources  in \ninfrastructure. \nTable 3: Financing Sources for Infrastructure Projects \n \nDomestic Sources  External Sources \nEquity \n\u2022 Domestic developers (independently or in  \u2022 International developers (independently or in \ncollaboration with international developers)  collaboration with domestic developers) \n\u2022 Public utilities (taking minority holdings)  \u2022 Equipment suppliers (in collaboration with \n\u2022 Other institutional investors (likely to be limited)  domestic or international developers) \n\u2022 Dedicated infrastructure funds \n\u2022 Other international equity investors \n\u2022 Multilateral agencies  \nDebt \n\u2022 Domestic commercial banks (3\u20135 year tenor)  \u2022 International  commercial  banks  (7\u201310  year \n\u2022 Domestic  term  lending  institutions  (7\u201310  year  tenor) \ntenor)  \u2022 Export credit agencies (7\u201310 year tenor) \n\u2022 Domestic bond markets (7\u201310 year tenor)  \u2022 International bond markets (10\u201330 year tenor) \n\u2022 Specialized infrastructure financing institutions   \u2022 Multilateral agencies (over 20 year tenor) \nSource: Planning Commission, Government of India. \n                                                 \n6  India\u2019s financial sector is large and diversified. The banking system comprises the Reserve Bank of India, the \ncentral bank, and a network of 93 commercial banks with over 61,000 branches, 196 regional rural banks, and 389 \ncooperative  banks.  In  addition  to  commercial  banks,  the  financial  sector  also  includes  non-bank  financial \ncompanies, development finance institutions, insurance companies, and venture capital firms. Aggregate bank \ndeposits were estimated at about Rs24,928.54 billion ($635.44 billion) in FY2006, a 25% increase over the \nprevious year (which was itself 17% higher than the year before that). Non-food credit increased by about 19% \nduring FY2006 to Rs18,014.13 billion ($459.19 billion). The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority \nestimates that pension funds are worth Rs1,166 billion ($29.72 billion) and are expected to grow to Rs4,065 billion \n($103.61 billion) by FY2024.  ", "  5\n11.  Infrastructure finance market is further characterized by the absence of an active long-\nterm corporate debt market, asymmetric information on infrastructure projects, and inherent \nrisks in financing infrastructure projects.7 Adding to the problem of inadequate long-term funds is \nthe conversion of development finance institutions (DFIs), which had been the major source of \nlong-term  finance,  into  commercial  banks.  Further,  the  commercial  banks  in  general  have \nlimited experience in infrastructure financing. \n12.  Development Finance Institutions. DFIs were originally established in the 1940s and \n1950s to support industrial development through state intervention (directed lending). After \nfinancial liberalization in the early 1990s, subsidized funding to DFIs were discontinued. As \nintended, this led to the demise of most DFIs in view of their inability to compete in the market. \nDFIs that met prudential and regulatory requirements were allowed to convert into commercial \nbanks by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI),8 the central bank. While the Industrial Credit and \nInvestment Corporation of India merged with ICICI Bank Limited, the Industrial Development \nBank of India became a commercial bank. Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation, \npromoted by the Government and government-owned financial institutions, undertook an initial \npublic offering in January 2006 and became privately-owned and incorporated as Infrastructure \nDevelopment Finance Company (IDFC). Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) \nincorporated in 1987, also broad-based its ownership. As compared to their equity, the loan \nbooks of IL&FS and IDFC are nearly full.9 Not being in a position to significantly expand their \nasset size, both IL&FS and IDFC have diversified into fee based activities such as project \nadvisory, asset management (equity and debt investment funds), and project development.  \n13.  Corporate Debt. The withering away of DFIs, should have prompted corporations to \napproach  the  market  for  resources,  leading  to  a  vibrant  corporate  debt  market.  However, \ndomestic firms still rely more on banks and internal resources than on market borrowings, \nindicating weakness in debt markets especially secondary markets.10 A weak secondary market \nleads to an absence of benchmarks and an illiquid market for interest rate derivatives and \nhedging  mechanisms  does  not  provide  investors  the  opportunity  to  exit  investments.  In \nresponse to these constraints, the commercial banks generally charge floating rates11 which \neffectively  makes  a  loan  a  short  duration  instrument  and  infrastructure  providers  pass  on \n                                                 \n7  Infrastructure projects are complex, capital intensive, and have long gestation periods that involve multiple and \noften unique risks to project financiers. Due to its non-recourse or limited recourse financing characteristic (i.e., \nlenders  can  only  be  repaid  from  the  revenues  generated  by  the  project),  and  the  scale  and  complexity, \ninfrastructure financing requires a complex and varied mix of financial and contractual arrangements amongst \nmultiple parties including the project sponsors, commercial banks, domestic and international financial institutions \n(FIs), and government agencies. The risk assessment for a project and its allocation will depend on the conditions \nincluding the type and location of the project, the sector, feedstock supply and off-take arrangement, and the \nproposed technology and so forth. Insufficient knowledge and appraisal skills related to infrastructure projects also \nadd to the risk.  \n8  On 8 December 1997, RBI constituted a working group chaired by Mr. S.H. Khan to bring about greater clarity in \nthe respective roles of banks and other financial institutions. The working group held the view that DFIs should be \nallowed to become commercial banks in order to facilitate efficient allocation of resources. \n 9  IDFC\u2019s equity book is currently around $192 million with a loan book of $3.6 billion. Currently, the Infrastructure \nLeasing and Financial Services has a total equity of $27 million ($436 million net worth) with an asset base of $2.2 \nbillion. \n10 World Bank. 2005. India\u2019s Financial Sector: Recent Reforms, Future Challenges. Washington, DC. \n11 At present, except for raising funds for infrastructure projects, commercial banks are not allowed to issue bonds \nwith long maturities. Thus, there are not enough issuers of bonds. Restrictions have also been imposed on the \ninvestment activity of contractual savings institutions. As a result, lack of growth in bond investment persists.  \n ", "6   \nhedging costs to the end-users. In addition, commercial banks largely depend on short-term \ndeposits for funding and do not undertake long-term market borrowings.12 \n14.  Reforms. Substantive and sustained institutional and market reforms in the financial \nsector are required to channel resources from domestic and internationally available debt and \nequity sources to infrastructure. Without reforms, it will be difficult to significantly enhance the \nmarket-based flow of resources from commercial banks, DFIs, as well as pension and mutual \nfunds to meet the demand for infrastructure financing.  \n(i)  Government  securities.  RBI,  has  accorded  priority  to  the  consolidation  of \ngovernment  securities  and  has  re-issued  existing  securities  to  increase  the \nfloating stocks in the market, helping to increase liquidity in key benchmark \nmaturities  (3\u201310  years  maturities).  In  the  process,  the  maturity  structure  of \ngovernment bonds has lengthened and a credible yield curve for government \nsecurities has developed, which now stretches to over 20-years maturity. This \nhas  created  a  benchmark  for  pricing  long-term  corporate  debt  including \ninfrastructure bonds. Closely related to these developments are initiatives to \nstrengthen the market for interest rate derivatives after RBI permitted the banks \nto  engage  in  forward  contract  or  interest  rate  swaps.  The  introduction  of \nexchange-traded  interest  rate  derivatives  and  the  design  of  a  sound  risk \nmanagement framework by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), \nthe capital market regulator, are important steps in this regard. These initiatives \nhave positive implications on the corporate debt market. Over the medium-term \nthese  could  lead  to  improved  liquidity  in  infrastructure  related  financial \ninstruments. \n \n(ii)  Corporate  debt  market. Systemic measures for strengthening the corporate \nbond  markets  are ongoing  pursuant  to  the  recommendations  of  a  high-level \ncommittee of the Government, the Patil Committee.13 The recommendations aim \nto (i) provide credit enhancements for instruments issued by financial institutions \nincluding special purpose vehicles (SPVs) for financing infrastructure projects. \nThis  measure  would  encourage  long-term  sources  of  debt  especially  from \ncontractual savings institutions and foreign investors to invest in infrastructure; (ii) \nevolve a consensus on affordable levels of stamp duty on debt assignments; and \n(iii)  implement  a  trading,  clearing,  and  settlement  system.14 SEBI  has  been \ncharged  with  the  responsibility  of  providing  a  regulatory  framework  for  the \nsecondary bond market including establishing (i) a trade reporting system; (ii) \nclearing and settlement system; and (iii) an order matching system. In addition, \nRBI  has  drafted  guidelines  on  the  usage  and  offering  of  credit  derivatives, \nspecifically credit default swaps.15  \n \n(iii)  Contractual savings. Going forward, the Government is expected to focus on \nreforming India\u2019s contractual savings institutions namely, insurance, pension, and \nprovident funds, which are the main sources of long-term funds. The Insurance \nRegulatory Development Bill, passed in December 1999, opened the insurance \nsector for PSP and allowed foreign equity up to 26% (increased to 49% in \nFY2005).  A  recent  study  estimated  India\u2019s  unfunded  pension  liabilities  at \n                                                 \n12 Long-term government securities are usually absorbed by pension and insurance funds and held until maturity.  \n13 High Level Committee on Corporate Bonds and Securitization (2005).  \n14 This measure is to give investors who have illiquid corporate bonds an opportunity to re-cycle them. \n15 Source: RBI, DBOD.

", "  7\nRs17,355 billion ($441.38 billion) or 55.9% of GDP.16 Given the high ratio of \nnational  public  debt  to  GDP  at  84.9%,  the  contingent  liability  related  to  the \nunfunded-defined  benefit  pension  schemes  compounds  India\u2019s  public  debt \nproblem.  To  address  these  issues,  the  Government  embarked  wide-ranging \nreforms  of  its  pension  systems  including  (i)  discontinuing  unfunded  defined \nbenefit pension schemes, (ii) introduction of a new pension scheme with defined \ncontributions and requiring the funds in this new pension scheme to be privately \nmanaged, and (iii) the establishment of an interim Pension Fund Regulation and \nDevelopment Authority. Privately managed pension scheme will allow the fund \nmanagers to explore the possibility of channeling pension funds to long-term \ninfrastructure bonds.  \n \n  4.  India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited  \n15.  Infrastructure is a critical determinant of productivity, inclusive development, national \nintegration, and poverty reduction. Insufficient capacity across infrastructure sectors leads to a \nwidening infrastructure gap, resulting in lower productivity, higher transport and logistics costs, \nreduced competitiveness, and slower growth. While these aspects are well recognized by the \npolicy makers and corresponding reform initiatives are underway, several interlocking factors \nincluding policy and regulatory inadequacies in infrastructure sector persist. Despite initiatives \nby the Government for improving the availability of long-term funds, policy, institutional, and \nmarket gaps remain. The impact of the ongoing reforms in the real and financial sectors will only \nbe  felt  over  the  medium-  to  long-term  and  as  a  result,  the  already  significant  gap  in \ninfrastructure financing will further increase. Innovative responses consistent with the PSP and \nPPP agenda are required for addressing the prevailing market inadequacies and at the same \ntime keeping the infrastructure development agenda moving forward.  \n16.  IIFCL  was  established  on  5  January  2006  under  the  Companies  Act,  1956  as  a \nGovernment-owned  SPV  specifically  in  the  context  of  (i)  the  magnitude  of  infrastructure \ninvestments  required  and  very  limited  supply  of  long-term  resources  and  (ii)  the  need  to \ncatalyze  financing  for  PPP  projects.  Central  to  Government\u2019s  PPP  development  strategy, \nIIFCL\u2019s establishment has been extensively deliberated within the Government and with experts \nsuch  as  the  Patil  Committee  and  international  and  domestic  financial  institutions.  Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  World  Bank  have  extended  support  to  ensure  IIFCL\u2019s \nautonomy and commercial orientation.  \n \n17.  IIFCL has a lean capital and operating structure with paid-in capital of $76.3 million and \nauthorized capital of $225.3 million. IIFCL is expected to raise (i) rupee debt of 10-year maturity \nand beyond, (ii) debt from bilateral or multilateral institutions, and (iii) foreign currency market \nborrowings.17 IIFCL\u2019s  market  borrowings  are  government-guaranteed18 to  encourage  funds \nresident in long-term financiers such as insurance and pension funds to invest in infrastructure. \nIIFCL\u2019s operating paradigm, the Scheme for Financing Viable Infrastructure Projects through \nIIFCL (or the Scheme) was approved by the Committee on Infrastructure chaired by the prime \n                                                 \n16 This does not include liabilities related to defense employees, central and state civil pensioners, and the funding \ngap in the Employees\u2019 Provident Funds. \n17 Currently, IIFCL is holding discussions with Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) for \u20ac280 million ($395 million) \nloan. Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is also considering a \u00a570.5 billion ($600 million) loan under a \nJBIC-guaranteed United Loan Program. IIFCL has also approached the World Bank for a line of credit of $500 \nmillion. IIFCL plans to raise up to $1 billion through external commercial borrowing and has approached the \nGovernment and RBI for approval. \n18 Currently, a guarantee limit of Rs100 billion ($2.54 billion) has been specified by the Government. \n ", "8   \nminister (Appendix 3). Pursuant to its Scheme, IIFCL will provide long-term debt financing at \ncommercial rates for stand-alone non-recourse infrastructure projects or projects that are units \nof larger corporate entities. While IIFCL can fund both public and private sector projects, it \nprioritizes PPP projects selected through transparent and competitive bidding and assessed for \ncommercial viability. The mechanism by which IIFCL performs its market enhancing role is \nanalyzed in Appendix 4. The corporate governance framework of IIFCL is in Appendix 5. \n \n18.  IIFCL is expected to catalyze and promote PPPs by leveraging market-based project \ndevelopment  skills  and  providing  much  needed  long-term  debt  for  financing  infrastructure \nprojects.  This  includes  (i)  extending  support  to  infrastructure  projects  in  partnership  with \ninstitutions like IL&FS, IDFC, and National Highway Authority of India; (ii) considering PPP \nprojects at the state and municipal levels e.g., roads, urban development, ports, tourism related \ninfrastructure; (iii) providing financial instruments for enhancing investments in infrastructure, \ne.g.,  such  as  guarantees,  debt,  and  equity;  and  (iv)  establishing  market  benchmarks.  \nAccordingly, the Government has also designated IIFCL as the debt manager of a $3 billion \ndebt fund of the $5 billion India Infrastructure Financing Initiative. IIFCL, in partnership with \nBlackstone Group, CitiGroup, and Infrastructure Development Finance Company are investors \nin the $2 billion equity fund of the India Infrastructure Financing Initiative. Further, IIFCL and 3i \nGroup plc. have entered into a strategic partnership for equity and long-term debt financing for \nprojects in power, port, airport, and road sectors.  \n19.  IIFCL is also expected to be the lead agency in using India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves \nto finance infrastructure projects. Under this arrangement, IIFCL has been given in principle \napproval for setting up two offshore SPVs which will borrow funds from RBI and lend to Indian \ncompanies  implementing  infrastructure  projects,  or  to  co-finance  their  external  commercial \nborrowings for such projects solely for incurring expenditure outside India.  \nC.  ADB Strategy, Sector Assistance, and Policy Dialogue  \n20.  ADB\u2019s Sector Strategy. ADB\u2019s Country Operations and Business Plan 2007\u2013200919 \nrecognizes that (i) the rapid growth envisaged in the 11th FYP cannot be achieved or even \nsustained  at  the  current  rate  without  the  support  of  high  quality  infrastructure  and  (ii)  the \nchallenges in raising the estimated $475 billion investment in infrastructure over the 11th FYP \nperiod remain a major constraint in realizing the projected economic growth. The Government\u2019s \ndevelopment  strategy  for  the  11th  FYP  emphasizes  (i)  continued  focus  on  infrastructure \ndevelopment, i.e., road, rail, air, and water transport, power, telecommunication, water supply, \nirrigation, and storage; and (ii) measures to encourage PPPs for the financing, designing, \nimplementing, and operating existing and new infrastructure subprojects.  \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s Sector Assistance. Since India began to borrow from ADB in 1986, ADB has \nassisted public sector infrastructure projects especially in transport and power sectors. As of 31 \nMarch  2007,  ADB\u2019s  infrastructure  portfolio  in  India  includes  50  projects  (energy,  power, \ntransport, roads, railways, and communications) totaling over $9.86 billion (Appendix 6). ADB \nalso provided 114 TA projects totaling over $56.3 million as of 31 March 2007.  \n \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2006.

ADB\u2019s ongoing TAs20 are providing crucial support for mainstreaming PPPs (paras. 6\u20137) \nthrough  the  establishment  of  PPP  cells  in  selected  states  and  central  line  ministries  and \ncapacity building support for (i) PPP project preparation, appraisal, and evaluation skills; and (ii) \noperationalizing identified PPP opportunities. In addition, these TAs also support (i) refining the \nPPP policy and regulatory framework, (ii) improving bidding documents and procedures, (iii) \ncompliance with public safety norms, (iv) building a PPP database, and (v) conducting value-\nadded research. ADB has also provided sector specific TAs for promoting PPPs.21 Through its \nprivate sector operations, ADB invested in two infrastructure equity funds and in the equity \ncapital of IDFC. More recently, ADB provided assistance to a private sector power transmission \nproject and a private sector liquefied natural gas terminal.  \n \n23.  ADB has also provided extensive support for developing India\u2019s domestic capital market. \nADB-funded  Financial  Sector  Program  Loan22 supported  the  development  of  a  diversified, \ncompetitive,  and  market-based  financial  sector.  Building  on  this,  the  Capital  Market \nDevelopment Program Loan23 helped establish an integrated national capital market system. \nADB has also been actively engaged in insurance and pension reforms.24 These programs have \nincreased operational and market efficiency and reduced costs and risks, improved market \naccessibility, strengthened investor protection, and enhanced the availability of long-term funds \nfor infrastructure and industry. For promoting greater PSP, ADB also provided two financial \nintermediation loans for infrastructure development.25  \n \n                                                 \n20 ADB. 2006.

While the overall assessment of the first financial intermediation loan \nwas successful,26 the low utilization experienced in the second loan27 suggest the need to (i) \nincorporate  flexibility  in  financing  arrangements,  (ii)  address  environmental  and  social \nsafeguards issues at the project design stage instead of at the implementation stage, (iii) \nsupport PPPs, and (iv) improve  ADB\u2019s capacity in subsovereign and non-sovereign public \nsector  financing  to  respond  to  the  changing  environment  and  client  needs.  A  matrix \nsummarizing the lessons learned is presented in Supplementary Appendix A. In addition, the \nCountry Assistance Program Evaluation for India28 also emphasizes effective demand as pre-\nrequisite for financial intermediary loans. It also underlines the need for addressing structural \nissues that affect mobilization of domestic resources as well as effective demand.  \n25.  External  Assistance.  As  of  June  2006,  the  World  Bank  (including  International \nDevelopment Assistance) had an infrastructure investment portfolio of 56 projects, amounting to \n$11.3  billion.29 Official  Development  Assistance  loans  by  the  Government  of  Japan  have \nsteadily increased since FY1990. As of March 2006, a total of 185 projects had been committed \nby  Japan  Bank  for  International  cooperation  (JBIC)  for  a  total  of  \u00a52,252.5  billion  ($19.15 \nbillion).30 The Government of Germany has made financial commitments to India amounting to \n\u20ac6.3 billion ($8.93 billion). In addition, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) has extended \u20ac774 \nmillion ($1.1 billion).31 External assistance for infrastructure in India is summarized in Appendix \n7. \n26.  Policy Dialogue. ADB\u2019s extensive support for the financial sector and infrastructure \n(paras. 21\u201323) is in the context of sustained policy dialogue at various levels of the government. \nSubstantive assessment32 underpinned the mainstreaming of PPPs through ongoing TAs (para. \n22), among others, for developing a pipeline of bankable projects to establish effective demand \nfor infrastructure financing. The ongoing dialogue has also led to amendments to the Scheme \nfor  incorporating  best  practices  such  as  risk-based  pricing  and  in-house  risk  assessment \ncapacity in IIFCL. ADB extended support to develop IIFCL\u2019s business strategy in consultation \nwith development partners and also enabled IIFCL to undertake international rating (para. 33). \nADB also led the effort to establish a common environmental and social safeguards framework \n(ESSF) 33 of IIFCL which has since been endorsed by JBIC, KfW, and the World Bank (paras. \n66-67). Policy dialogue also facilitated the adoption of international best practices in IIFCL with \n                                                 \n26 ADB. 2003.

The recommendation of these TAs \nemphasized the establishment of PPP units at central and state government levels to assist in project development \nand achieving financial closure considering that corporate long-term debt market remained undeveloped and \nsuffered from a number of impediments, including limited participation by long-term market participants such as \nprovident and pension funds and insurance companies, a weak secondary market, absence of a benchmark yield \ncurve, and inadequate support infrastructure.  \n33 ADB\u2019s safeguards policies, namely, Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995), Environment Policy (2002), and Policy \non Indigenous Peoples (1998) require that the financial intermediary should have an adequate policy framework \nbacked by institutional capacity to ensure that any subproject financed by the financial intermediary, using ADB \nfunds, comply with ADB\u2019s safeguards policy requirements.  ", "  11\nregard to financial management and review mechanisms (paras. 68\u201369). As part of the ongoing \npolicy dialogue, ADB plans to assess the progress in infrastructure financing and suggest \nevolution to the Scheme in view of the ongoing real and financial sector reforms.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED FACILITY \n27.  The Facility involving a loan of $500 million to IIFCL (the Borrower) will directly support \nthe Government\u2019s infrastructure development agenda through enhancing the availability of the \nmuch needed long-term funds for infrastructure financing. With ADB\u2019s assistance through the \nFacility, IIFCL will be able to provide funds at commercial terms with over 20-years maturity for \ninfrastructure subprojects, which is currently not being provided by the market.  \n \n28.  The Facility is an integral part of ADB\u2019s sector strategy and complements ADB\u2019s parallel \ninitiatives in contractual savings, corporate bonds, PPPs, and infrastructure development, all of \nwhich contribute to creating an enabling environment for long-term financing for infrastructure \ndevelopment.  \n \n29.  Multitranche Financing Facility. The MFF is particularly well-suited for the Facility \nbecause (i) the MFF structure allows the flexibility to IIFCL in its investment decisions based on \nthe readiness of subprojects which will dictate disbursement projections as well as fund raising \nplan of IIFCL; and (ii) the performance of the subprojects financed can guide the financing of \nfurther subprojects, among others, through incentives such as introduction of free limit for \nfacilitating implementation. Further, the Facility supports IIFCL\u2019s institutional transformation in \nline with the evolving real and financial sector reforms, thus building a long-term partnership \nbetween ADB and IIFCL.  \nA.    Impact and Outcome \n \n30.  A significant share of the estimated investment requirement of $475 billion during the \n11th FYP needs to originate from the private sector. In this context, the Facility, while small \ncompared to the total needs, is the first international assistance to IIFCL. It is estimated that the \n$500 million Facility will help catalyze an investment of $2.5 billion\u2013$3.5 billion from the private \nsector for financing of 30\u201340 PPP subprojects.34 The success of the Facility in establishing a \nframework for implementing the Scheme could trigger substantial investments considering the \nconvergence that will emerge as a result of the (i) expected support from the World Bank, JBIC, \nand KfW; (ii) firm commitments from the international private equity sources (Blackstone Group, \nCitiGroup and 3i Group plc); and (iii) the synergies envisaged from the proposed overseas \nsubsidiaries of IIFCL (paras. 17\u201319).  \n  \n31.  The Facility will result in infrastructure development through increased PSP thereby \npromoting economic efficiency and growth and reducing poverty. This is expected to have a \nmultiplier effect on infrastructure sectors as well as on the broader economy. Enhanced PSP \nthrough PPPs will contribute to containing and eventually reducing the fiscal deficit.  \n32.  The Facility is also expected to strengthen the institutional capacity of IIFCL in credit risk \nmanagement and project risk appraisal. International credit rating will enable IIFCL to source \nstable long-term funding from the international markets. This in turn will encourage IIFCL to \nadopt international best practices in corporate governance and financial management. \n                                                 \n34 IIFCL will finance subprojects only as a member of consortium where its total lending to any subproject will not \nexceed 20% of the total capital cost for the subproject (Appendix 3). \n ", "12   \nB.  Outputs \n33.  The ADB supported outputs through the Facility are grouped into two areas: \n(i)  Creating  high  quality  and  viable  infrastructure  assets.35 The  Investment \nProgram (para. 39) of IIFCL will create high quality and viable infrastructure \nassets across sectors including roads (37 subprojects), power (22 subprojects), \nseaports  (2  subprojects),  airports  (2  subproject),  and  urban  infrastructure  (1 \nsubproject) covering the states of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, \nKarnataka,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Maharashtra,  Orissa,  Rajasthan,  Sikkim,  Tamil \nNadu, and Uttar Pradesh.  \n \n(ii)  Creating institutional capacity: The Facility seeks (a) IIFCL to be rated by \ninternational  credit  rating  agencies 36  for  facilitating  access  to  international \nmarkets, (b) to develop capacity of IIFCL for the implementation of the ESSF to \nscreen and monitor subprojects and develop reporting formats (paras. 66-67), \nand (c) to provide capacity building and institutional development support to \nstrengthen IIFCL\u2019s resource management, project risk appraisal capability, and \ninvestment policies.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n34.  Promoting PPP and PSP is a major paradigm shift in infrastructure financing in India. \nGovernment\u2019s request for ADB support in this process is in recognition of ADB\u2019s extensive \ninvolvement  in  infrastructure  sector  and  financial  sector  reforms.  Consultations  with  the \nGovernment and other stakeholders including development partners enabled the design of the \nFacility as a second generation financial intermediation loan that is in the context of effective \ndemand. Further, the Facility through the Scheme is well-anchored to the ongoing reforms in the \ninfrastructure and financial sectors.  \n35.  Transaction  Costs.  The  Facility,  the  first  MFF  through  a  financial  intermediary,  is \ndesigned to enable ADB to leverage its resources to finance a wide range of subprojects in a \nprogrammatic manner across subsectors rather than discretely finance individual subprojects. \nThis is expected to reduce transaction costs for the Government as well as for ADB.  \n36.  Public-Private Synergy. The Facility is part of the integrated PPP development strategy \nin India and draws on the extensive ADB support for infrastructure development through PPPs. \nIIFCL is well-positioned to finance PPP subprojects emerging from the ongoing ADB support \n(para.  22)  for  mainstreaming  PPPs.  The  development  of  PPP  subprojects  by  professional \nproject  developers  (such  as  IDFC  and  IL&FS)  and  consideration  of  such  subprojects  for \nfinancing by a consortium of investors and lenders including IIFCL, ensures deepening of \nproject preparation and financing skills in the country. Among the development partners, ADB is \nuniquely placed to finance PPP subprojects by offering customized financing options through its \npublic and private sector windows.   \n37.  Lead Role. IIFCL has been designed to catalyze the flow of foreign institutional and \nprivate equity funds in the emerging PPP space in India. This ushers in international best \n                                                 \n35 Figures refer only to 64 approved subprojects. This list will be extended further as 70 more subprojects are \nexpected to come into IIFCL\u2019s pipeline over the next fiscal year (FY2008). \n36 On 7 August 2007, Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services assigned its \u201cBBB-/Stable\u201d ratings to IIFCL at par with the \nsovereign rating of India.  ", "  13\npractices in infrastructure financing including financial products and technology. The diligence of \nthe policy makers in ensuring that IIFCL remains anchored to the market and evolves with real \nand financial sector reforms reinforces the catalytic role for IIFCL in infrastructure development.   \n38.  Long-Term Benchmark Rate. By providing long-term lending on commercial terms, \nIIFCL will facilitate pricing of risk for infrastructure. This will also help establish benchmark rates \nfor infrastructure bonds. The presence of IIFCL as a long-term financier will also provide comfort \nto equity investors who have exposures to subprojects for the length of the concession period. \nD.   IIFCL\u2019s Investment Program and Financing Plan \n39.  As of end September 2007, IIFCL had a pipeline of 64 sanctioned subprojects37 with a \ntotal cost of Rs1,115.85 billion ($28.38 billion), of which IIFCL\u2019s financing is estimated at $3.81 \nbillion (about 15% of total subproject costs). Additional 70 subprojects are expected to come \ninto its pipeline over the next fiscal year (FY2008). As a result of these asset additions, IIFCL\u2019s \nbalance  sheet  will  grow  to  around  $6  billion\u2013$8  billion  during  FY2007-FY2011.  Table  4 \nsummarizes the indicative financing plan for FY2007\u2013FY2011 under the assumption that IIFCL\u2019s \nbalance sheet will grow to $6 billion.  \nTable 4: Financing Plan FY2007\u2013FY2011 \n($ million) \n \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  500  8.34 \nLocal Market Borrowingsa  3,000  50.00 \nForeign Borrowingsb  2,500  41.66 \n  Total  6,000  100.00 \na  Funds that the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited will \nraise from the domestic market including insurance and pension \nfunds, and the National Savings Scheme.  \nb  Foreign borrowings include bilateral and multilateral sources and \nfunds that the India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited will \nraise from the international capital markets. \n Source: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n40.  IIFCL, through the Government, has requested financing of $500,000,000 from ADB\u2019s \nordinary capital resources (OCR) to help finance part of its Investment Program. Accordingly, \nthe Facility was included in the India Country Operations Business Plan FY2007 (footnote 19). \nThe Facility will have multiple tranches and will be in accordance with ADB policy.38 The Facility \nwill have an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan and guarantee agreements.39 IIFCL has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that \nthese were its own independent decision and not made as a result of any communication or \nadvice from ADB. \n41.  India will provide a sovereign guarantee in form and substance, acceptable to ADB, for \nthe term of each loan as a condition precedent to the effectiveness of each tranche requested \nby IIFCL and provided by ADB pursuant to the terms of each loan agreement. \n                                                 \n37  The list of sanctioned subprojects is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n38  ADB. 2005.

The  Borrower  and  India  have  entered  into  a \nframework  financing  agreement  (FFA)  with  ADB.  The  FFA  satisfies  the  requirements \nestablished  in  Appendix  4  of  the  ADB  Innovation  and  Efficiency  Initiative:  Pilot  Financing \nInstruments  and  Modalities.40 The  FFA  records  the  full  set  of  assurances,  warranties  and \nrepresentations  on  crosscutting  themes  covering  safeguards,  governance,  anticorruption, \nfinancial management, procurement, and disbursement and subproject selection. Before ADB \naccepts the periodic financing request (PFR), India and IIFCL will ensure full compliance with \nthe terms and conditions of the FFA. \n43.  Periodic Financing Request. Multipurpose subloans will be extended under the Facility \nto a range of subprojects subject to submission of the related PFR by IIFCL and execution of \nrelated loan and guarantee agreements. Each PFR will be accompanied by a list of subprojects \nidentified for financing under the Facility including those subprojects which can be substituted \nfor subprojects that are not in compliance with ADB requirements. Each individual tranche will \nbe for not less than $100 million. The first tranche PFR (PFR1) for $300 million to finance \ninfrastructure subprojects has been received. Appendix 8 lists 24 illustrative subprojects which \nhave been submitted to ADB for consideration under PFR 1. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n44.  Project Management. IIFCL will be the EA of the proposed Facility. Policy direction and \nstrategic oversight will be provided by IIFCL\u2019s Board of Directors. A project management unit \n(PMU) will be established by IIFCL to monitor the screening and selection of subprojects in \nconsultation  with  the  consortium  of  lenders.  The  PMU  will  also  monitor  day-to-day \nimplementation of the Facility. The PMU will be staffed with existing IIFCL staff to the extent \npossible and consultants will fill residual capacity gaps. PMU staff will consist of specialists with \nexpertise in risk and project management. A senior officer, reporting directly to the Chairperson \nof the IIFCL, will be appointed to ensure and certify project compliance with the ESSF. The \nPMU will have a dedicated finance and accounts officer to monitor accounts and processing \nclaims. The PMU will be responsible for the identification, screening, selection, and monitoring \nof  all  subprojects  ensuring  compliance  with  state  and  national  policies  and  the  ESSF.  In \naddition, the PMU will be responsible for developing and implementing an investment program \nperformance monitoring system (IPPMS). The Implementation Schedule is provided in Appendix \n9. \n45.  Subproject  and  Subborrower  Selection  Criteria.  The  Scheme  defines  the \nsubborrower  and  subproject  selection  criteria,  appraisal  and  monitoring  mechanisms  and \nlending terms for projects (Appendix 3), which includes, inter alia, appraisal by the lead bank for \ntechnical, economic, and commercial viability. In addition, each subborrower funded under the \nFacility will \n(i)  be  selected  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time); \n(ii)  have adequate resources and financial capability to raise resources to complete \nand operate the relevant subproject successfully; \n(iii)  not  be  in  default  on  any  prior  loan  from  the  Borrower  or  from  any  of  the \nparticipating members of the consortium of lenders;  \n(iv)  be able to provide security as required by the consortium of lenders; \n                                                 \n40 ADB. 2005.

Approval Procedure. Subprojects under the Facility will be processed as follows. \n(i)  IIFCL will review the preliminary designs and cost estimates for all subprojects \nproposed under the respective tranches as approved by the lending consortium.  \n(ii)  Prior to the preparation of each PFR, the applicability and relevance of common \nESSF for environmental assessment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples will be reviewed and updated to ensure their relevance and consistency \nwith applicable country frameworks.  \n(iii)  In formulating each new PFR, IIFCL will review potential ongoing subprojects to \nascertain their compliance with ESSF. These review reports will be submitted to \nADB  together  with  other  relevant  safeguard  documents  for  information  and \nreview. If any major non-compliance is found during such a review, ADB will \nrequest a corrective action plan which will be prepared by IIFCL and submitted to \nADB for review and approval. In addition, any subproject which will be financed \nunder the Facility will follow the approved common ESSF. \n(iv)  IIFCL  will  submit  the  compliance  certificate  along  with  the  PFR  to  ADB  for \napproval. \n47.  A PFR will (i) state the required loan amount; (ii) list the subprojects to be financed under \nthe tranche; (iii) be accompanied by appraisal reports for the listed subprojects including the \nenvironmental assessment report41 and appropriate resettlement plan and indigenous peoples \nplan,  if  any;  (iv)  give  cost  estimates  and  detail  the  financing  plan;  (v)  spell  out  the \nimplementation  arrangements;  (vi)  confirm  the  continuing  validity  and  adherence  to  the \nprovisions  of  the  FFA;  (vii)  confirm  compliance  with  the  provisions  under  previous  loan \nagreements;  and  (viii)  provide  other  information  required  under  the  facility  administration \nmemorandum to be prepared and agreed upon by ADB, the Government, and IIFCL to facilitate \nthe implementation and processing of the Facility. \n48.  Maximum Subloan Size and Free Limit. As IIFCL is limited by its Scheme to financing \nup to 20% of subproject cost, ADB will not stipulate any additional limitation on the size of the \nsubloans. However, all subloans under the first tranche will be subject to prior review and \napproval of ADB. For subsequent tranches, a suitable free limit pursuant to the provisions of \nADB\u2019s Operations  Manual42 may  be  determined  for  IIFCL based  on ADB's  assessment  of \nIIFCL\u2019s performance, appraisal standards, portfolio quality, management, average loan size, \nand the subproject pipeline. ADB will, however, reserve the right to review subprojects even \nbelow the free limit to ensure safeguard compliance. \n49.  Period of Utilization. The Facility will be available for 4 years (FY2007\u2013FY2011). To \nensure timely implementation in line with the Government\u2019s emphasis on the disbursement \nreadiness of approved loans, the Borrower will prepare a detailed disbursement plan for the \n                                                 \n41 For subprojects categorized as environment category B\u2013sensitive or category A, ADB\u2019s 120-day rule for the \nsubmission of the periodic financing request will apply. \n42 ADB. 2003.

The last date on which any disbursement under any tranche may be made \nwill be 30 November 2011. The final PFR should be submitted no later than 1 November 2010. \n50.  Procurement. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time),43 ADB will encourage the Borrower to require its subborrowers to adopt \ninternationally competitive bidding procedures to the extent possible when the amount of the \ninvestment is unusually large and economy and efficiency can be gained by following such \nprocedures. For procurement of goods and services to be financed by subloans out of ADB loan \nproceeds, the Borrower will ensure that the price paid is reasonable, and that account is taken \nof factors such as time of delivery, efficiency, and the reliability of goods. For build-operate-\ntransfer projects and their variants, if the subproject sponsor or engineering, procurement, and \nconstruction contractor is selected through competitive bidding among international entities in \naccordance with procedures acceptable to ADB, such subproject sponsor or contractor may \napply  its  own  procedures  for  procurement,  provided  that  such  procurement  is  for  goods, \nservices, and works supplied from, or produced in ADB member countries.  \n51.  Disbursement Arrangements. The EA shall ensure that the individual loan proceeds \nunder the Facility will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time). While making disbursements, IIFCL will review the \nutilization report for each subproject verified by a chartered accountant and lead bank. The \nutilization report shall also be accompanied by an engineer\u2019s certificate. The borrower will \nestablish an imprest account in a current account, with a commercial bank acceptable with ADB. \nThe imprest amount at any time will not exceed (i) 10% of each loan tranche, or (ii) estimated \nexpenditures for the first 6 months of project implementation, whichever is lower.  \n52.  Governance  and  Anticorruption  Policy.  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  (1998,  as \namended to date) was explained to and discussed with IIFCL. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  review  and \nexamine,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent,  collusive,  or  coercive  practices  relating  to  the \nsubprojects  under  the  Facility.  To  support  these  efforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s \nAnticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the \nprojects under the Facility. In particular, all subprojects financed by ADB in connection with the \nFacility shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to review and examine the records \nand accounts of the Borrower, subborrowers, suppliers, contractors, and other service providers \nas they relate to the subprojects.  \n53.  IIFCL will, under its comprehensive business plan, disclose to its Board of Directors all \nfinancial relationships and transactions of the non-executive directors in its Annual Report. \nCompensation levels of all Board of Directors will also be disclosed. IIFCL management will be \nrequired  to  disclose  to  the  Board  of  Directors  all  the  material,  financial,  and  commercial \ntransactions where members of management have a personal interest and transactions that \nhave a potential conflict of interest with the interests of the IIFCL. The management of IIFCL will \nalso provide clear description of contingent liabilities and associated risks.    \n54.  IIFCL will constitute an audit committee with non-executive directors as members and \n50% representation by independent directors. In addition, IIFCL will have a \u201cwhistle blower\u201d \npolicy which will help to maintain the ethical standards of IIFCL and enhance its image with \nstakeholders. Under this policy, staff members who notice unethical or improper practices will \nbe able to approach the audit committee without informing their supervisors. Employment and \n                                                 \n43 ADB. 2007. Procurement Guidelines. Manila (para. 3.12).  ", "  17\nother  personnel  polices  will  contain  provisions  protecting  \u201cwhistle  blowers\u201d  from  unfair \ntermination and other unfair employment practices. IIFCL will present its corporate governance \nframework in a separate section in its Annual Report along with a compliance report.  \n55.  Accounting,  Auditing,  and  Reporting. IIFCL, through the PMU, will establish and \nmaintain separate records for works, goods, and services financed out of loan proceeds. IIFCL \nwill maintain separate project accounts according to generally-accepted accounting principles \nfor  all  expenditures  incurred  under  the  Facility  and  the  subprojects,  whether  out  of  loan \nproceeds or from other sources, and record, in a transparent manner, all funds received from \nthe Government, ADB, and other sources. \n56.  Detailed consolidated annual project accounts will be maintained by IIFCL through the \nPMU and will be audited by independent auditors whose qualifications, experience, and terms of \nreference are acceptable to ADB. The accounts will be submitted to ADB within 6 months of the \nend of the fiscal year. The annual audit report will include a separate audit opinion on the use of \nloan proceeds, free limit (para. 48), and compliance with financial loan covenants. IIFCL has \nbeen made aware of ADB\u2019s policy regarding delayed submission of audits and its requirements \nfor a satisfactory and acceptable audit of accounts. \n57.  Advance  Contracting  and  Retroactive  Financing.  In  cases  where  IIFCL\u2019s \nmanagement has approved advance contracting for consultant recruitment and procurement of \ngoods and civil works, retroactive financing may be requested for the first PFR under the MFF. \nFor  subsequent  loans as  well,  ADB  may  agree  to  a  request  for  advance  contracting  and \nretroactive financing of civil works, equipment and materials, and recruitment of consulting \nservices, subject to these being requested under following PFRs and subject to the request \nbeing in accordance with the agreed procedures and guidelines. All such requests will be \nassessed on a subproject-by-subproject basis. These arrangements will facilitate the readiness \nof subprojects under the Facility and will be considered for subsequent subprojects during the \nprocessing of individual PFRs. The total eligible expenditure under retroactive financing will not \nexceed an amount equivalent to 20% of the individual loan and must have been incurred not \nmore than 12 months before the signing of the related legal agreements. However, approval of \nadvance action and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance the subprojects being \ndeveloped under the facility. Before being accepted for retroactive financing, such subprojects \nwill be reviewed and certified by IIFCL for their compliance with ESSF.  \n58.  Subproject Performance Monitoring and Evaluation. IIFCL will be responsible for \nestablishing an IPPMS acceptable to ADB within 3 months from the signing of the FFA and the \nfirst  PFR.  For  the  IPPMS,  IIFCL  will  first  select  a  set  of  clearly  measurable  performance \nmonitoring indicators relating to implementation, improvements, institutional development, and \ncapacity building milestones including those in the design and monitoring framework. IIFCL will \nestablish a baseline data for each of the selected indicators within 6 months of the date that the \nfirst loan under the Facility takes effect. Subsequently, IIFCL will conduct annual surveys and \nwill update ADB on progress against each indicator. IIFCL will submit quarterly progress reports \nattached to the facility administration memorandum. IIFCL will also submit to ADB a completion \nreport within 3 months of the completion of all ADB-supported activities and subprojects.  \n59.  Subproject Review. ADB will, at its discretion, conduct reviews of the management, \nfinancial, and operational performance of the Borrower and subprojects financed under the \nFacility after the closing of withdrawals. Such reviews will include safeguard implementation and \nprocurement procedures used by the subprojects.   \n ", "18   \n60.  The performance of the Facility will be reviewed periodically at three levels: (i) by IIFCL \nthrough the PMU (quarterly), (ii) by IIFCL\u2019s Board of Directors (semi-annually), and (iii) by ADB \n(annually). The quarterly review by the PMU will be completed by the 10th day following the \nquarterly review. IIFCL\u2019s Board of Directors will review the performance semiannually and will \nforward the semi-annual progress reports to ADB by the 10th day of the month following the \nsemi-annual review. ADB will review the quarterly progress reports and semi-annual reports \nduring the annual review missions and during the tripartite reviews chaired by the Government. \nIn addition, a midterm review of the investment program will be conducted in FY2008. The \nreview  will  cover  disbursements,  implementation  progress,  including  progress  of  capacity \nbuilding initiatives, ESSF implementation, and status of the IPPMS. The review will identify \nweaknesses  and  suggest  changes  in  scope,  outputs,  and  due  diligence,  and  agree  on \nsuggested changes. \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n61.  The TA for an amount of $500,000 is attached to the Facility. The TA is expected to be \nimplemented over a 12-month period from July 2008 to June 2009, and aims to (i) support \ncapacity development within IIFCL to manage market and credit risks; and (ii) to train IIFCL staff \nin risk assessment, management, and mitigation. The TA consists of the following components. \n(i)  Enhancement of resource management function. The TA will assist IIFCL to \nstrengthen the capacity of its resource management function to manage risks \narising from its funding and financing activities.  \n(ii)  Risk  assessment.  The  TA  will  assist  the  development  of  (i)  risk  appraisal \nprocedures,  (ii)  pricing  tools,  and  (iii)  credit  risk  management  processes  to \nenable IIFCL to acquire in-house project risk assessment capability.  \n(iii)  Enhancement  of  resource  management  systems.  The  TA  will  identify \nsoftware and hardware for upgrading IIFCL\u2019s resource management systems and \nprocesses. \n(iv)  Training of staff. The TA will provide training on resource management and risk \nassessment.  \n62.  IIFCL will be the EA for the TA. The TA outcomes will be monitored by DEA, ADB, and \nIIFCL through consultant reports, periodic consultations, and review missions. ADB will engage \nTA consultants through a firm, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). The quality- and cost-based selection and biodata \ntechnical  proposal  methods  will  be  used.  The  terms  of  reference,  cost  estimates,  and \nimplementation arrangements are described in Supplementary Appendix C.  \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n \n63.  Glaring infrastructure deficits in all sectors can be felt in all locations in India. The huge \ncost  on  the  society  of  this  deficit  from  lower  productivity  to  reduced  competitiveness  has \nprompted  concerted  efforts  for  infrastructure  development.  In  this  context,  the  Facility  is \ndesigned as part of the policy, regulation, and institutional mechanisms being established for ", "  19\nmainstreaming PSP and PPPs for enhancing the role of private sector funds, technology, and \nmanagement in infrastructure development.  \n  1.  Integrated Framework  \n64.  As a financial institution, IIFCL can respond to infrastructure financing opportunities only \nwhen it operates in a conducive policy environment, is commercially oriented, and appropriately \nfunded. The Scheme provides this framework.  \n(i)  IIFCL\u2019s  Scheme  is  designed  for  enabling  innovative  financing  options  for \nsupporting heterogeneous infrastructure delivery models by integrating a range \nof financing instruments (equity, debt, and guarantee) and financing sources \n(domestic  markets,  multilateral  sources,  international  equity,  domestic  and \ninternational borrowings).  \n \n(ii)  IIFCL will be able to leverage the core competences of promoters and project \ndevelopers for building a shelf of PPP subprojects. As a result, IIFCL will be able \nto intermediate and provide innovative solutions for designing, packaging, and \nfinancing PPP subprojects for sectors and locations in need for such support.  \n \n(iii)  By limiting IIFCL\u2019s financing to 20% of subproject costs and long-tenor funds (20 \nyears and above), the Scheme seeks to catalyze investments. Financial closure \nof subprojects sanctioned by IIFCL as of end September 2007 is expected to \ncatalyze nearly $25 billion in investments,44 of which the Facility will help catalyze \nnearly $2.5 billion\u2013$3.5 billion.  \n \n(iv)  Catalyzing private sector investments for infrastructure development will help \ncontain and reduce the fiscal deficit at all levels.  \n \n(v)  IIFCL will keep itself aligned to best practices for ensuring international ratings at \ninvestment  grade  and  above.  The  commercial  orientation  of  IIFCL  is  further \nreinforced by the requirement of the Scheme to finance only viable subprojects.  \n \n(vi)  The credit enhancing function of the Government guarantee for IIFCL borrowings \nwill help channel latent sources of funds, such as insurance and pension funds, \nfor infrastructure development. The pricing of long-term loans by IIFCL in line \nwith  the  risk  characteristics  of  subprojects  will  also  facilitate  the  creation  of \npricing benchmarks for infrastructure related financial instruments.  \n  2.  Financial Analysis \n65.  While the subprojects sanctioned by IIFCL are spread across all subsectors, the majority \nof subprojects tentatively identified for first PFR of the Facility are for roads. The economic \nefficiency of road projects is typically high with Economic Internal Rate of Return (EIRR) in the \n25\u201330%  range  and  Financial  Internal  Rate  of  Return  (FIRR)  in  the  10\u201315%  range.  The \nestimates  are  also  robust  from  a  sensitivity  point  of  view  with  the  EIRRs  and  FIRRs  not \n                                                 \n44 The total cost of the subprojects sanctioned by IIFCL at the end of September 2007 (Supplementary Appendix D) is \n($28.38 billion), of which IIFCL\u2019s financing is estimated at $3.81 billion. As a result, financial closure of these \nsubprojects would imply catalyzing nearly $25 billion worth of investments. With the projected growth in balance \nsheet of IIFCL during the next 5 years, the catalytic role could be significant. Additional resources would also be \ncatalyzed through equity from various sources as a result of IIFCL\u2019s long-term debt financing.  \n ", "20   \ndeclining  significantly  even  in  worst  case  scenarios.  Further,  the  EIRRs  and  FIRRs  are \nsignificantly above the opportunity cost of capital. The Facility is also expected to finance power \ntransmission projects. The EIRR estimates in this case also meet the benchmark requirements. \n3.  Environmental and Social Safeguards  \n66.  ADB took the lead45 in developing a common ESSF46 (Supplementary Appendix G) in \nconsultation with World Bank, KfW, and JBIC for harmonizing the safeguards policy framework \nfor involuntary resettlement, the environment, and indigenous peoples (paras. 26, 33, 66\u201367). \nShowing remarkable awareness of the need for environmental and social safeguards in all \naspects of infrastructure development, IIFCL participated in the development of ESSF and \nadopted the same. As part of the subproject selection process, IIFCL will screen subprojects to \ndetermine whether they trigger the compliance requirements of ADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement, \nenvironment, and indigenous peoples policies. If they do, IIFCL will ensure that each subproject \nhas appropriate instruments to adequately address these requirements and will submit the \nrequired documents either to ADB or a third party acceptable to ADB for review. IIFCL will not \nfinance  subprojects,  using  the  funds  from  the  Facility  which  do  not  adequately  address \nsafeguard requirements.  \n67.  In-house capacity to implement the ESSF is being established with ADB support and \nIIFCL is setting up a unit for ensuring that all subproject proposals to be financed under the \nFacility comply with the requirements of the ESSF. The capacity building initiatives at IIFCL \ninclude appointing qualified specialists in environment and social safeguards issues to staff the \nunit47 who will train IIFCL staff in reviewing and approving subprojects. Appendix 10 provides \nthe Summary ESSF.  \n  4.  Financial Management \n68.  A financial management assessment (FMA) to examine IIFCL's financial and fiduciary \nmanagement capacity for implementing the Facility was undertaken (Supplementary Appendix \nE).48 IIFCL has adopted an accrual system of accounting reflecting double entry accounting \nprinciples and supported by standardized software. IIFCL undertakes three levels of audit: (i) a \nconcurrent  internal  audit  by  a  firm  of  chartered  accountants,  (ii)  a  statutory  audit  by  an \nindependent firm of chartered accountants appointed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of \nIndia, and (iii) a supplementary audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India. As part of \nthe Facility, IIFCL will closely monitor the physical and financial progress of subprojects based \n                                                 \n45 The process of preparing the environmental and social safeguards framework was guided by ADB\u2019s Environment \nand Social Safeguards Division. The first meeting of development partners took place on 9 February 2007 and the \nsecond meeting on 13 August 2007. The draft social safeguards framework was uploaded to the ADB website on \n17 August 2007. Available: http://www.adb.org/Documents/Resettlement_Plans/IND/40655/default.asp. \n46 The common safeguards frameworks include (i) the anticipated impacts of the components or subprojects likely to \nbe financed under the multitranche financing facility on the environment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous \npeoples; (ii) safeguards criteria to be used in selecting subprojects; (iii) requirements and procedures to be \nfollowed to screen and categorize them, conduct impact assessments, develop management plans, hold public \nconsultations, and disclose public information (including the 120-day disclosure rule, if required), and monitor and \nreport the progress of such subprojects or project components; (iv) the institutional arrangements (including budget \nand capacity requirements); and (v) IIFCL\u2019s and ADB\u2019s responsibilities and authorities for the preparation, review, \nand clearance of safeguards documents. \n47 As an interim measure, two national consultants (one environmental and one social safeguards specialist) were \nhired in July 2007 and have commenced the work.   \n48 The FMA was based on discussions with various officials of IIFCL, Indian Credit Rating Agency Limited, and the \nWorld Bank. The World Bank conducted its own FMA and the ADB and World Bank teams shared the findings of \ntheir respective FMA reports. ", "  21\non the utilization certificates provided by the firm of chartered accountants and lead banks prior \nto  disbursements  in  line  with  Government  norms.  ADB  will  reserve  the  right  to  verify  the \nfinancial accounts of IIFCL and related parties.  \n  5.  Enhanced Governance Framework \n69.  IIFCL  is  governed  by  the  Companies  Act,  1956,  (Appendix  5)  which  prescribes \ndisclosure norms. IIFCL intends to self-regulate and has incorporated best practices of non-\nbanking finance companies in its comprehensive business plan.49 The regulatory regime will be \nbased on (i) nonperforming asset norms, (ii) asset classification, (iii) provisioning norms, (iv) \nincome  recognition,  (v)  credit  concentration,  (vi)  special  reserve  maintenance  (capital \nrequirements) liquidity requirements, and (vii) resource-raising norms. Adherence to this regime \nwill be reviewed annually and reported to the Board of Directors of IIFCL. Further, in addition to \nStandard & Poor\u2019s, IIFCL also plans to be rated by Fitch and Moody\u2019s for strengthening its \ncompliance with best international practices.50 As part of the Facility, the best practices adopted \nby IIFCL are summarized below.  \nTable 5: Internal Governance Impact on India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited \nArea  Key Internal Reform Elements  \nFinancial  \u2022  Review and audit by ADB of IIFCL and eligible subborrowers, \nManagement  \u2022  Regular review of \u2019s accounts by ADB, and \nand Audit  \u2022  Adoption of measurable financial management indicators. \n \nResource  \u2022  Improving resource management operations through enhanced  \nManagement  \u2022  Financial Policies, \n\u2022  Investment Policies, \n\u2022  Asset-Liability Management Procedures and Systems, and \n\u2022  Functional Support for Efficient Resource Management. \n\u2022  Improved staff capability. \n \nAnticorruption   \u2022  Review and examination of the subborrowers by ADB and  \n\u2022  Reporting of observed malpractices to the authorities. \n \nADB = Asian Development Bank, IIFCL = India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited. \nSources: India Infrastructure Company Limited\u2019s Comprehensive Business Plan and ADB analysis. \n \n  6.  Poverty Impact  \n70.  Infrastructure investments lead to higher farm and nonfarm productivity, employment \nand income opportunities, and increased availability of wage goods, thereby reducing poverty \nby raising mean income and consumption. If higher agricultural and nonagricultural productivity \nand increased employment directly benefit the poor more than the non-poor, these investments \ncan both reduce poverty and improve income distribution. Investment in infrastructure as a \nwhole and on roads and transportation in particular contributes to poverty reduction by (i) \nreducing  transactions  costs;  (ii)  enabling  economic  agents  like  individuals,  firms,  and \ngovernments to respond efficiently to demand; (iii) lowering costs of inputs used in production of \n                                                 \n49 ICRA Management Consulting Services Limited was mandated by IIFCL to formulate a comprehensive business \nplan in November 2006 under World Bank TA grant. The final report was submitted on 17 May 2007 to IIFCL. ADB \nwas given an opportunity to comment on the draft final report. \n50 International credit rating agencies closely monitor all aspects of operational performance and failure to comply \nwith best practice is likely to lead to a rating downgrade and an increase in financing costs. \n ", "22   \nalmost all goods and services; (iv) opening up new opportunities for entrepreneurs; (v) creating \nemployment especially in public works both as social protection and as a counter-cyclical policy \nin  times  of  recession;  (vi)  enhancing  human  capital  by  improving  access  to  health  and \neducation; and (vii) improving environmental conditions which have an impact on improved \nlivelihoods, better health, and vulnerability of the poor The Summary Poverty Reduction and \nSocial Strategy is in Appendix 11. \nB.  Assumptions, Potential Risks, and Mitigations \n71.  While the growing recognition of the significance of infrastructure development and the \nongoing reforms in the infrastructure and financial sectors provide the context for the Facility, \nthe envisaged benefits and impact depends on several assumptions that are subject to varying \ndegrees of risk. Mitigating measures have been put in place where feasible and appropriate. \n72.  Effective Demand. The identification and development of bankable PPP subprojects \nprovides the effective demand for the Facility. While PPP is emerging as the preferred mode for \ninfrastructure development, capacity constraints will have to be addressed for transforming the \npotential for PPPs into a stream of bankable subprojects. This risk is being dealt by intensive \nsupport  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners  for  mainstreaming  PPPs.  Upfront \nidentification of subprojects for the first PFR of the Facility has been made. \n73.  Institutional  Capacity.  The  ability  of  IIFCL  to  leverage  government  guarantee  to \ngenerate low-cost and longer tenor funds is critical for its catalytic role. This also depends on \nthe market perception of the quality of IIFCL\u2019s pipeline, credit appraisal, and disbursement \nprocedures, risk management and appraisal systems, environmental and social safeguards \ncompliance procedures, and operational efficiency. Factors that mitigate these risks include (i) \nintensive appraisal of the subprojects by IIFCL; (ii) the emphasis of IIFCL\u2019s mandate and \nScheme  on  commitment  to  operational  autonomy,  good  governance,  and  commercial \norientation; and (iii) ongoing ADB and World Bank support to IIFCL for developing systems and \nprocedures and human resource development. IIFCL will maintain a lean organization of core \nspecialists for reducing cost overheads. \n74.  Regional Distribution. Variations in the preparedness for PPPs across states pose the \nrisk of regional concentration of subprojects supported by the Facility. While relative merits of \nthe viable subprojects should guide IIFCL\u2019s financing decisions, a reasonable geographical \nspread is also desirable. In consultation with the IIFCL, the identified subprojects to be financed \nby  the  Facility  are  spread  over  a  number  of  states  (para.  33).  The  ongoing  efforts  for \nmainstreaming PPPs will also help generate viable subprojects in all parts of the country. \n75.  Reform  Commitment.  Despite  the  recent  success  in  reducing  constraints  to \ninfrastructure development, the shift from public financing of infrastructure to PPPs could take \nmore time than expected. In addition, the reforms involve a range and hierarchy of stakeholders \nthat could also slow the momentum of reforms. This risk is being mitigated through positive \nincentives by the Government for enhancing the bankability of infrastructure projects (para. \n6(v)). In addition, for promoting economic growth, state governments are proactively reducing \nconstraints to infrastructure development.  ", "  23\nVI.   ASSURANCES \n76.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and IIFCL have given the \nfollowing  assurances.  These  will  be  incorporated  into  the  individual  loan  agreement(s)  as \napplicable and mutually agreed by the Government and ADB for each tranche under the MFF.  \n77.  The Government and IIFCL will ensure the following:   \n(i)  The Government remains committed to the implementation of the Scheme for \nFinancing  Viable  Infrastructure  Projects  through  IIFCL.  In  the  event  of  any \nchange  in  the  Scheme,  the  Government,  IIFCL,  and  ADB  will  assess  the \npotential impact on the Facility and evaluate any change in scope, amendment, \nor continuation, as appropriate, of the Facility; \n(ii)  IIFCL complies, at all times, with the prudential norms, as made applicable to it \nby  the  Government,  including  capital  adequacy,  income  recognition, \nclassification, and provisioning of nonperforming assets; \n(iii)  IIFCL maintains a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.0 and ensure that it \nhas no arrears in repayment of its current debt obligations; \n(iv)  The subprojects and subborrowers meet the eligibility criteria agreed with ADB, \nincluding financial and economic viability and positive developmental impact; \n(v)  All subprojects are submitted to ADB for prior review, unless otherwise agreed \nbetween ADB and IIFCL; \n(vi)  The on-lending rates to subborrowers are market-based and adequate to cover \nall costs and risks associated with on-lending including any foreign exchange \nrisk; \n(vii)  The subborrowers adopt and implement appropriate procurement procedures \nthat  are  based  on  competitive  bidding  and  foster  economy,  efficiency,  and \ntransparency;  \n(viii)  A  subloan  to  a  subborrower  is  made  for  only  such  subproject  that  involves \nprocurement of goods, works, and consulting services from member countries of \nADB, and the amount of which is at least equal to the size of the subloan for such \nsubproject; \n(ix)  The ESSF formulated with other development partners and satisfactory to ADB is \nimplemented and that all subprojects financed with ADB funds comply with the \nESSF; \n(x)  The environmental management system framework as set out in the ESSF is \nimplemented in accordance with its terms and acceptable to ADB to ensure that \neach subproject is undertaken in compliance with applicable environmental laws \nof India, relevant State of India, and ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). Further, \nthat for each subproject, initial environmental examination (IEE), environmental \nimpact assessment (EIA), and the environment management plan, as applicable, \nare submitted to ADB for review and approval before IIFCL submits the PFR, and \nthat for any category A or environmentally sensitive B subproject, the IEE or the \nsummary EIA is made available to the public 120 days before a PFR is submitted \nto ADB;  \n(xi)  The social safeguards framework (SSF) as set out in the ESSF is implemented in \naccordance with its terms and satisfactory to ADB, and that each subproject, \nwhich involves land acquisition and has resettlement impacts, is undertaken in \ncompliance with all the applicable laws of India, the relevant State of India, and \nADB\u2019s  Involuntary  Resettlement  Policy  (1995).  Further,  that  the  resettlement \nplans are submitted to ADB for approval, before IIFCL approves the subproject. \n ", "24   \nFurthermore, each subborrower is required by IIFCL to ensure that (a) all land \nand rights-of-way required for subprojects are obtained in a timely manner; (b) \nthe provisions of the resettlement plans are implemented in accordance with its \nterms; (c) all compensation and resettlement assistance is given to the affected \npersons prior to their dispossession and displacement and commencement of \ncivil works; (d) resettlement plans are updated upon completion of the detailed \ndesign and submitted to ADB for approval prior to commencement of civil works; \n(e) adequate staff and resources are committed to supervising and monitoring \nimplementation  of  the  resettlement  plans;  and  (f)  an  independent  agency \nacceptable to ADB and IIFCL is engaged by the subborrower to monitor and \nevaluate results of implementation of resettlement plans and forward reports to \nADB and IIFCL as required; \n(xii)  Subprojects  do  not  adversely  affect  vulnerable  groups,  such  as  indigenous \npeoples, and in the event of any impact or their involvement, IIFCL will implement \nthe  SSF  as  set  out  in  the  ESSF  in  accordance  with  its  terms  to  ensure \ncompliance with ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples (1998); \n(xiii)  Adequate  number  of  staff  are  trained  and  deployed  to  fully  implement  and \ncomply with the ESSF; \n(xiv)  Accountability and transparency in IIFCL are maintained in its operations through \nthe  stakeholder  meetings  and  publication  of  progress  reports  through  the \nduration  of  the  Facility.

Introduction \n \n1.  In recent years, India has been one of the fastest growing economies in the world with \ngrowth rates averaging around 7\u20139% per annum during the 10th Five-Year Plan (FYP) period \n(fiscal year [FY]2001\u2013FY2006). This is partly due to the 15 years of economic reform. The \nGovernment of India (the Government) would like to push growth rates even higher to match the \nperformance of countries like the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), but to do so will require \nhigh quality infrastructure. There is a significant infrastructure deficit in the economy requiring \nlarge scale investment in almost all infrastructure subsectors including transportation (roads, \nports, rail, and airports), energy (generation and transmission), and communications. Table A2.1 \nprovides a comparison of infrastructure indicators for India and the PRC. \n \nTable A2.1: Comparative Infrastructure Availability \nItem  India  PRC  Year \nPer capita income ($)  571  1,416  2003 \nElectricity consumption (kWh per capita)  380  987  2002 \nUrbanization (%)  28  39  2003 \nRailways (goods hauled per capita in MT per km)  313  1,171  2003 \nRoads (length in km per million people)  3,116  1,371  2002 \nPorts (container traffic in TEU per million people)  10,305  62,434  2003 \nAir (passengers per million people)  18,286  66,802  2003 \nkm = kilometer, kWh = kilowatt-hour, MT = metric tons, PRC = People\u2019s Republic of China, TEU = \ntwenty-foot equivalent units. \nSource: World Bank. \n \n2.  The PRC spends seven times as much as India on infrastructure in absolute terms, \nspending $150 billion in FY2003 on electricity, roads, airports, ports, and telecommunications, \ncompared with $21 billion spent by India. While PRC\u2019s capital spending on infrastructure is \nabout 10.6% of gross domestic product, expenditure in India is around 4%. According to the \nCommittee on Infrastructure, as India aims to expand its economy at the rate of 8\u20139% in the \ncoming  years,  infrastructure  spending  will  have  to  reach  around  9%  of  GDP.  It  is  further \nestimated that infrastructure investments of around $475 billion will be required to sustain a \ngrowth rate of 9%. These figures translate into a required compound average growth rate \n(CAGR) of investments of around 15% over the 11th FYP period (FY2007\u2013FY2012). The critical \ngaps in each subsector are outlined in this appendix. \n \n3.  Traditionally, the Government was the sole investor in infrastructure and has financed \nand implemented the bulk of its infrastructure outlays and also managed risks. The ability of the \nGovernment to commit funds for infrastructure has come under pressure. The overall fiscal \ndeficit continues to remain high with wide variations across states. As can be seen from Table \nA2.2, while the deficit position has improved since FY2004, the levels continue to remain high \nconstraining the state from being able to fulfill infrastructure funding requirements.  \n \nTable A2.2: Fiscal Performance Indicators \n($ billion) \n  Gross Fiscal Deficit  Revenue Deficit  Primary Deficit \nPeriod (FY)    GDP%    GDP%    GDP% \n2000  30.29  5.69  25.53  4.08  4.97  0.93 \n2001  35.93  6.18  27.50  4.39  8.54  1.47 \n2002  36.98  5.90  25.46  4.40  6.95  1.10 \n ", "32   Appendix 2 \n  Gross Fiscal Deficit  Revenue Deficit  Primary Deficit \nPeriod (FY)    GDP%    GDP%    GDP% \n2003  33.67  4.80  19.42  3.60  1.92  0.30 \n2004  35.03  4.40  23.53  2.50  2.02  0.30 \n2005 (RE)  37.26  4.10  22.62  2.60  4.11  0.40 \n2006 (BE)  37.90  3.80  23.53  2.17  2.26  0.10 \nBE = budget estimates, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product, RE = revised estimates. \nSource: Reserve Bank of India.   \n \n4.  The  Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  Act  of  FY2002  targeted  the \nelimination of the revenue deficit by FY2008 and a reduction in the fiscal deficit to 3% in the \nsame period. In response, a series of improvements in the area of transparency and medium-\nterm fiscal planning at both the national and state\u2013level has been instituted. By the end of the \nfirst quarter of FY2005, 22 of the 28 states had enacted their own Fiscal Responsibility and \nBudget Management Act. Most states have also established state finance commissions for \nequitable revenue distributions across districts, parallel to the central finance commission. \n \n5.  In  order  to  meet  the  infrastructure  deficit  and  harness  the  financing  and  project \nmanagement capabilities of the private sector, the Government has taken several initiatives to \nprovide the necessary environment in which the private sector can operate both via direct \nprivate sector participation as well as through public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements. \nThese include (i) introducing model concession agreements in various subsectors such as \nroads,  ports,  and  airports;  (ii)  establishing  independent  regulatory  mechanisms  to  enforce \nservice standards and improve cash flow stability; (iii) encouraging participation of long-term \nfinanciers in the market through credit enhancement measures and provision of implicit risk \ncapital; and (iv) reforming the capital markets to support long-term financing instruments and \nimplicit risk capital, etc. Nodal agencies such as National Highways Authority of India and \nAirports Authority of India have taken the lead in partnering with financial institutions to promote \nPPP.  Government  policy  initiatives  indicate  that  it  is  being  driven  by  a  desire  to  make \ninfrastructure inclusive. The overall reform agenda is being pursued to ensure that policy and \nregulatory frameworks under which infrastructure is developed promotes contestable markets \nwhich ensure competitive pricing of services that are natural monopolies.  \n \n6.  Further, PPP enabling initiatives include (i) relaxing regulations; (ii) reducing foreign \ninvestment restrictions; (iii) introducing tax, customs, and other incentives to enable PPP; and \n(iv) developing the capital market. Table A2.3 below (page 36) provides an overview of the \npolicy  initiatives  that  have  already  been  undertaken  to  promote  PPP  and  private  sector \nparticipation and the forward reform agenda. \n \nB.  Current State of Indian Infrastructure \n \n7.  The  infrastructure  deficit  in  India  requires  large  scale  investments  in  all subsectors \nincluding roads, ports, airports, power, and urban infrastructure. In the power sector alone, in \norder to sustain a GDP growth of 8\u20139%, India needs around 10,000 MW of capacity addition \nevery year over the next decade. Estimates suggest an investment requirement of over $600 \nbillion  over  the  next  few  decades  in  the  power  sector.  These  investments  do  not  include \ninvestments needed to augment capacities in fuel supply infrastructure, mining and supply, and \nports  and  terminals  in  order  to  sustain  expansion  in  generation  capacity.  Thus,  meeting \ninfrastructure requirements in one subsector may not be sufficient as one subsector is linked to \nanother through the supply chain that ultimately delivers electricity, water, transportation, and \nother services to end beneficiaries. These linkages suggest an overall investment program for \npower plants, electricity transmission and distribution systems, ports, roads and expressways, \n ", "Appendix 2  33\nbridges, railway engines and tracks, product handling, and storage facilities etc. The discussion \nbelow  provides  a  snap  shot  of  the  current  state  of  India\u2019s  infrastructure  and  investment \nrequirements in key infrastructure subsectors.  \n \n1.  Roads \n \n8.  India has an extensive road network of 3.3 million kilometers (km), 2nd largest in the \nworld, carrying 61% of the country\u2019s total freight and 85% of total passenger traffic. Projected \nannual growth over the 11th FYP is 12\u201315% for passenger and 15\u201318% for cargo traffic. World \nBank estimates indicate that over the next 10 years, there will be a need to widen 15,000 km of \nnational highways from two to four lanes, and a further 16,500 km requires upgrading from \nintermediate to two lanes. Estimates suggest that about 25,000 km of state highways need \nwidening. An estimated $50 billion\u2013$60 billion investment is required over the next 5 years to \nimprove road infrastructure. The cumulative funding shortfall from defined road user charges \nover the next 10 years is estimated at $25.66 billion, or 39% of total requirement. \n \n2.  Railways \n \n9.  Indian Railways, with a network of 63,221 route km, 1.6 million employees, 440 billion \nton kms of freight, and 615 billion kms of passenger traffic, is one of the largest in the world. \nOver the last few years, Indian Railways has managed to achieve a dramatic improvement in \nbusiness performance and is witnessing one of the largest expansions in history. The railways \nhave targeted moving 1,100 billion ton kms of freight and 8.4 billion passengers by the last year \nof the 11th FYP. Planned initiatives during 11th FYP include \n \n(i)  Construction of the eastern and western dedicated freight corridors at a cost of \n$15.29 billion.  \n(ii)  Construction of high-speed passenger corridors to run trains at more than 300 \nkm per hour. \n(iii)  Expansion  of  suburban  services  through  completion  of  the  Mumbai  Urban \nTransport Project phase I and initiation of phase II. \n(iv)  Double production of rolling stock compared with 10th FYP. \n(v)  Increased production of high horsepower and energy efficient locomotives.  \n \n10.  These initiatives are expected to require investments of around $89.21 billion between \nFY2006 and FY2014. Investment on this scale would have a multiplier effect resulting in an \nestimated increase in India\u2019s GDP by $356.86 billion during the investment period.  \n \n3.  Seaports \n \n11.  Indian  ports  handled  cargo  of  573  million  tons  per  annum  (MTPA)  in  FY2005,  an \nincrease of over 10.4% compared with FY2004. These ports transported about 95% by volume \nand 70% by value of India\u2019s international trade in FY2005. Further, 70% of the traffic at major \nports by volume is dry and liquid bulk, the remaining 30% is general cargo including containers \n(a figure which has grown by 9.5% per annum over the last 3 years). The current capacity of \n660 MTPA across existing ports needs to be increased to 1,300 MTPA by FY2011, requiring an \nestimated total investment of $15.33 billion during the 11th FYP.   \n \n \n \n ", "34   Appendix 2 \n4.  Airports  \n \n12.  India has 450 airports, some of which are nonfunctional. The Airports Authority of India \n(AAI) owns and operates 125 airports, of which only 62 are operational for commercial purposes \nand 11 are designated international airports. In FY2005, Indian airports handled 73 million \npassengers and 1.4 million tons of cargo. Passenger traffic grew by over 23% during FY2005 \ncompared with the pervious year, while cargo traffic increased by 9.5%. \n \n13.  Passenger traffic is expected to increase at a CAGR of 25% in the next 5 years. Over \n40% of passenger traffic is concentrated in the two main airports of Delhi and Mumbai. The total \nnumber of aircraft parking bays available in the country is around 200 and the actual fleet size is \n213. With plans for airline expansion and new entrants into the Indian domestic airspace, fleet \nsize is expected to double by FY2009. While work is underway to construct 60 new parking \nbays, there is a shortfall of over 250 parking bays in the domestic airline industry.These factors, \nalong with limited terminal capacity, increased congestion, poor infrastructure, and inadequate \nground handling systems aggravates the situation at the airports. An estimated investment of \naround $10.91 billion for airport upgrade is required over the 11th FYP.   \n \n5.  Urban Infrastructure \n \n14.  Adequate and equitable distribution of urban infrastructural services such as water and \nsewage disposal, and per capita provision of these basic services, are not in accordance with \nprescribed norms. According to data from the Ministry of Urban Development, of the 393 class I \ncities, only around 77 have water supply coverage. The per capita water supply is as low as 9 \nliters per capita per day in some areas. Also, 203 of the 401 class II towns have supply of less \nthan 100 liters per capita per day.  \n \n15.  The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission envisages assistance of around \n$12.74 billion over the next 7 years to improve infrastructure in 63 cities across the country, with \ntotal  investments  of  around  $26.28  billion.  Major  urban  infrastructure  projects  include  (i) \nBangalore metro, (ii) Mumbai metro, and (iii) Mumbai trans-harbor link. \n \n6.  Power \n \n16.  The total power generation capacity in India is more than 127,000 megawatt (MW). The \ntotal generation in FY2005 was 590 billion units registering a CAGR of 4.6% over the last 4 \nyears. While India has the 5th largest electricity generation capacity in the world, per capita \nconsumption is low at 606 units (half that of PRC). India\u2019s transmission and distribution network \nconsists of 5.7 million circuit km, making it the third largest in the world. \n \n17.  Despite the above, during the first half of FY2006, the total energy demand was 393 \nbillion units, of which 361 billion units was met (deficit of 8%). The peak demand during this \nperiod was 98,520 MW, of which 86,468 MW (deficit of 12.2%). With the demand-supply gap \nand  growth  driving  incremental  demand,  over  90,000  MW  of  fresh  generation  capacity  is \nrequired over the next two FYPs. \n \nC.  Conclusion \n \nThe infrastructure sector in India faces multiple constraints, and the policy and institutional \nresponse has been appropriately designed. With regard to financing, initiatives are underway to \nstrengthen  the  capital  market  to  channel  long-term  funds  to  the  sector.  Simultaneously, \n ", "Appendix 2  35\ninstitutional mechanisms have been established to provide the market with the necessary risk \ncapital to attract long-term debt and equity. Initiatives are also underway to establish appropriate \nregulatory mechanisms in various subsectors. While these initiatives are ongoing, they have not \nyet been fully completed. Various subsectors still require regulatory commissions, regulatory \nrulings, and redressal mechanisms. These mechanisms need to be strengthened to provide \nstability to long-term cash flows and reduce the need for risk capital and/or allow the market- \nbased provision of the same. The scale of financing required is beyond the financial capabilities \nof the public sector alone. Widespread reforms are thus underway to ensure sustained and \nprofitable private sector operations in infrastructure development.   \n  \n ", "  3\n6\nTable A2.3: Overview of Private Sector Participation/Public-Private Partnership Policy Initatives in Infrastructure Sector  A\np\nSector  Key Reform Initiatives  Forward Reform Agenda  p\ne\n  n\nd\nRoads and  \u2022  MCA for PPPs in national highways has been approved by the Planning  \u2022 Reducing resource constraints in terms of  ix\nHighways  Commission.  finances, technical manpower, project   2 \n\u2022  To attract private investment in road development, maintenance, and  management, and institutional strength in sector \noperation, the NH Act 1956 was amended in June 1995.

Background \n \n1.  This initiative addresses the need for providing long-term debt for financing infrastructure \nprojects that typically have long gestation periods. Debt finance for such projects should be of a \nsufficient tenure that enables cost recovery across the project life. However, Indian capital \nmarkets  lack  the  maturity  to  provide  long-term  debt  instruments.  Setting  up  of  the  India \nInfrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) is a policy initiative aimed at filling this gap. \n \n2.  Underdeveloped  pension  and  long-term  debt  markets  have  restricted  the  tenure  of \nproject  finance  in  India.  Most  of  the  available  debt  is  of  7\u201312  years  maturity,  whereas \ninfrastructure projects require a longer repayment period. This constraint leads to front loading \nof tariffs during the initial years of the project cycle with a view to ensuring repayment of debt. \nApart from affecting the users, this handicap also affects the competitiveness of infrastructure \nprojects. \n \n3.  The Scheme for Financing Viable Infrastructure Projects through the India Infrastructure \nFinance Company Limited (the Scheme) was devised by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) after \nextensive deliberations with the Planning Commission, financial institutions, experts, and other \nstakeholders. Thus, the Scheme formulated was considered and approved by the Committee on \nInfrastructure chaired by the prime minister, and was subsequently endorsed by the union \ncabinet.  \n \n4.  IIFCL has since been corporatized and will provide financial assistance through long-\nterm debt, either by way of refinance to banks and financial institutions, or by direct lending to \nproject companies. It will lend up to 20% of the capital costs of a project. For project appraisal \nand lending operations, IIFCL will rely on the lead banks associated with the respective projects. \nBuilt into this Scheme is a preference for public-private partnership (PPP) projects that are \nawarded to private companies selected through a competitive bidding process. Such projects \nwill be eligible for direct lending by IIFCL and will also receive an overriding priority. \n \n5.  IIFCL  will  raise  funds from  both  domestic  and  external  markets  on  the  strength  of \ngovernment guarantees which will be extended as necessary. In the first year of its operation, a \nguarantee limit of $2.55 billion has been specified by the Government. \n \n6.  IIFCL is expected to provide the much needed long-term debt for financing infrastructure \nprojects. In doing so, it will play a catalytic role in building world class infrastructure in India.  \n \n7.  The Scheme was notified by the Ministry of Finance and the Department of Economic \nAffairs vide O.M. No. 10/12/2005-INF1 dated 13 April 2006. The Scheme has been amended on \n23 April 2007 and on 30 April 2007.

Introduction \n \n1.1  Whereas the Government of India (the Government) recognizes that there is \nsignificant  deficit  in  the  availability  of  physical  infrastructure  across  different \nsectors and that this is hindering economic development. \n \n1.2  Whereas the development of infrastructure requires debt of longer maturity to \nsupplement the debt funds presently available.  \n \n1.3  Whereas the Government recognizes that such debt is usually not available \nbecause of the following constraints. \n \n(i)  Absence of benchmark rates for raising long-term debt from the market. \n(ii)  Asset-liability mismatch of the tenor of debt in case of most financial \ninstitutions. \n(iii)  High cost of long-term debt. \n \n1.4  Now, therefore, the Government\u2019s has decided to put into effect the following \nscheme for providing financial support to improve the viability of infrastructure \nprojects. \n \n2.  Short Title and Extent \n \n2.1  The  Scheme  will  be  called  the  Scheme  for  financing  Viable  Infrastructure \nProjects (VIP).

The magnitude of funds raised would \nbe determined by demand from VIPs. To the extent of any mismatch between the \nraising of funds and their disbursement, surplus funds would be invested in \nmarketable government securities. \n \n4.3  The borrowings of IIFCL may be guaranteed by the Government. The extent of \nguarantees to be provided shall be set at the beginning of each fiscal year by the \nMOF  within  the  limits  available  under  the  Fiscal  Responsibility  &  Budget \nManagement Act. However, bonds issued by IIFCL, unless otherwise directed by \nthe  Government,  will  not  be  included  against  Statutory  Liquidity  Ratio \nrequirements.

The total lending for \nsuch private projects shall not exceed 20% of the lending program of the \nSPV in any accounting year. The eligibility for direct lending and/or raising \nthe limit of 20% will be reviewed at the end of one year having regard to \nthe  progress  made  in  funding  public  sector  and  PPP  infrastructure \nprojects. \n(iv)  Provided  that  in  case  of  railway  projects  that  are  not  amenable  to \noperation by a private sector company, the empowered committee may \nrelax the eligibility criterion relating to operation by such company. The \nproject should be from one of the following sectors. \na.  roads and bridges, railways, seaports, airports, inland waterways, \nand other transportation projects; \nb.  power; \nc.  urban transport, water supply, sewage, solid waste management, \nand other physical infrastructure in urban areas; \nd.  gas pipelines; \ne.  infrastructure projects in special economic zones; and \nf.  international convention centres and other tourism infrastructure \nprojects. \n(v)  Provided  that  the  empowered  committee  may,  with  approval  of  the \nfinance minister, add or delete any sector/subsectors from this list. \n \n5.3  Only such projects which are implemented through a project company set-up on \na non-recourse basis shall be eligible for financing by IIFCL (see Annex 1 and \nAnnex 2 for amendment). \n \n5.4  In the event that the IIFCL needs any clarification regarding eligibility of a project, \nit may refer the case to the empowered committee for appropriate directions. \n \n \n \n \n ", "42  Appendix 3  \n6.  Appraisal and Monitoring by Lead Bank \n \n6.1  The lead bank shall present its appraisal of the project for consideration of the \nIIFCL. Based on such appraisal, the IIFCL may consider and approve funding to \nthe extent indicated in Article 7 below. \n \n6.2  The IIFCL will not normally be required to carry-out any independent appraisal of \nthe project. \n \n6.3  The lead bank shall be responsible for regular monitoring and periodic evaluation \nof compliance of the project with agreed milestones and performance levels, \nparticularly for purposes of disbursement of IIFCL funds.

The India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) was incorporated as a special \npurpose  vehicle  (SPV)  on  5  January  2006  under  the  Companies  Act,  1956  as  a  100% \ngovernment-owned company. IIFCL is a dedicated institution assuming a developmental and \ncatalytic role in the financing of infrastructure in India. The authorized capital of the company is \n$254.9  million  of  which  the  current  paid-up  capital  is  $76.3  million.  As  IIFCL  has  been \nincorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, it is not subject to Reserve Bank of India (RBI) \nregulations and guidelines with respect to capital adequacy norms. Capital requirements on \nboth sides of IIFCL\u2019s balance sheet are addressed under its operating model as expressed in \nthe Scheme (Appendix 3). IIFCL\u2019s Scheme also articulates the mechanism through which IIFCL \nwill play a catalytic role in the infrastructure finance market in India.  \n \nB.  IIFCL\u2019s Operating Paradigm \n \n2.  IIFCL\u2019s operating paradigm is described in the Scheme. The Scheme governs IIFCL\u2019s \noperations and enables it to play a key role in infrastructure finance in India. Its role is not only \nto catalyze investments from the private sector through public-private partnership (PPP) but also \nto draw-in investable long-term resources from the market. The key elements of the Scheme are \ndesigned to catalyze complementary financing on the debt and equity side, reduce market risk, \ndraw-in latent long-term resources, and leverage the project development and management \nskills available in complementary institutions in the market. \n  \n3.  In the above context, IIFCL does not function in isolation but is central to the coordinated \nPPP strategy of the Government. The key pillars of this strategy are \n \n(i)  Establishing PPP cell in the Department of Economic Affairs in the Ministry of \nFinance for coordinating the mainstreaming of PPPs nationwide.  \n(ii)  Establishing PPP cells in selected states and central line ministries for identifying \nPPP opportunities, developing projects, and bringing them to the market for \nfinancial closure.  \n(iii)  Establishing India Infrastructure Project Development Fund for financing PPP \nproject preparation activities such as conduct of feasibility studies.  \n(iv)  Setting up IIFCL, the Executing Agency for the proposed Facility, for providing \nlong-term funds for infrastructure development.   \n(v)  Creating the Viability Gap Fund with a current annual allocation of about $340 \nmillion for encouraging PPPs.1  \n \n4.  In addition to the above, IIFCL is also a strategic partner in private equity infrastructure \nfunds that have been set up. IIFCL has partnered with Blackstone Group, CitiGroup, and \nInfrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) to establish debt and equity funds which \nwill eventually grow to $5 billion through strategic investment. The equity fund is expected to \nraise $2 billion equity while the debt fund will grow to $3 billion. These funds will invest in \ninfrastructure subprojects set up under PPP modalities. IIFCL has also invested in the equity \n                                                 \n1  The Viability Gap Fund can provide catalytic grant assistance of up to 20% of the capital costs through which it \nexpects several subprojects to become bankable, attract private capital, and mobilize private sector efficiencies. \nThis support is especially important for regions and sectors where private sector is not readily forthcoming   \n ", "48  Appendix 4 \nfund which is being managed by IDFC and has been designated as the manager of the debt \nfund. Further, IIFCL is also expected to set up overseas subsidiaries that will channel long-term \nfunds from India\u2019s foreign exchange reserves to eligible infrastructure projects.2 Finally, IIFCL \nhas developed partnership arrangements with National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) for \nroad sector projects and with Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) for power \nsector projects. Taken as a whole, these initiatives, in conjunction with the mechanisms of the \nScheme and sector-wide reforms (Appendix 2), will facilitate market financing for infrastructure \nand catalyze private sector interest.     \n \nC.  Historical Context of Establishing IIFCL \n \n5.  IIFCL\u2019s role is rooted in India\u2019s past experiences with development finance institutions \n(DFI), as well as the global experience. DFIs which were originally set up to provide cheap long-\nterm funding to industries have been affected by financial sector reforms.3 In the absence of a \nwell-developed market for long-term capital, DFIs were the vehicles through which corporations \nmet project finance needs. An essential ingredient of India\u2019s previous growth strategy was the \nprovision of long-term funding from the state on concessional terms to DFIs and the directed \nonlending of funds by them. This was the primary reason for inefficient price discovery and \nsuboptimal  capital  allocation.  As  part  of  financial  reforms  in  FY1991  onwards,  subsidized \nfunding  was  no  longer  made  available  and  DFIs  had  to  float  bonds  to  meet  funding \nrequirements. Since the maturity of available funding became shorter, while industry needs \nremained long-term, maturity mismatches developed. Locking up funds in projects adversely \naffected DFIs\u2019 cash flows in the absence of an efficient secondary market for corporate debt that \nwould  have  provided  exit  opportunities.  At  the  same  time,  liberalization  allowed  blue  chip \ncorporations to raise money abroad, enabling them to source cheaper funds.  \n \n6.  In response, DFIs moved into the territory of commercial banks.4 In April 2001, RBI \nannounced that DFIs could become commercial banks if they met prudential and regulatory \nrequirements. The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) was the first to \nsubmit a road map for this purpose in late calendar year (CY)2000 and it subsequently merged \nwith ICICI Bank Ltd. and became a commercial bank. In FY2002, the Government approved the \nconversion of Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) into a commercial bank. In FY2005, \nthe restructuring of IDBI was preceded by the repeal of the IDBI Act, 1964 which paved the way \nfor its transition to a commercial bank.  \n  \n7.  With the conversion of DFIs into commercial banks (without a core infrastructure focus) \nand the limited ability of debt markets to provide long-term debt, financing sources for long-term \ndebt  have  dried  up.  Banks  largely  depend  on  short-term  deposits  for  funding  and  do  not \n                                                 \n2  RBI has recently granted an in-principle approval for channeling $5 billion annually from India\u2019s foreign exchange \nreserves through IIFCL\u2019s overseas subsidiaries for infrastructure development.   \n3  Starting in 1948 and throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the Government established three DFIs to provide long-term \nfinance. These were Industrial Finance Corporation of India (1948), ICICI (1955), and IDBI (1964). RBI and the \nGovernment nurtured the DFIs through financial incentives and other policy measures, such as being provided with \nlow-cost funds and guarantees by the Government for bond issuances. RBI allocated a substantial part of its \nnational industrial credit (long-term operations) funds to IDBI.  \n4  On 8 December 1997, RBI constituted a working group chaired by Mr. S.H. Khan to bring about greater clarity in \nthe respective roles of banks and other financial institutions for greater harmonization of facilities and obligations. \nThe report of the committee on banking sector reforms (the Narasimham committee) had a major bearing on the \nissues considered by the Khan working group. The Narsimham committee suggested that DFIs should convert \nultimately into either commercial banks or non-bank finance companies. The Khan working group also held the \nview that DFIs should be allowed to become banks at the earliest opportunity. The feedback on the working group \nrecommendations indicated that universal banking is desirable from the point of view of efficient use of resources. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  49\nundertake long-term market borrowings.5 Loan officers of banks are typically not trained to \nassess  the  long-term  stability  of  cash  flows  from  a  project  finance  perspective.  Further, \ninstitutions  such  as  IL&FS  and  IDFC  who  have  the  ability  and  expertise  to  finance  large \nsubprojects are unable to do so due to capital constraints. \n \n8.  While demise of DFIs should have encouraged corporates to go to the market for \nresources, leading to a vibrant corporate debt market, the corporate debt market remains weak, \nilliquid, and does not offer long-term financing instruments. In this light, several initiatives are \nongoing to develop the long-term corporate debt market. The Government appointed a high \nlevel committee (the Patil committee)6 to recommend measures in developing the corporate \ndebt market. Key recommendations include (i) developing a credit enhancement mechanism for \nbonds  issued  by  state-owned  corporations  or  other  SPVs  for  financing  infrastructure;  (ii) \nrecommending  affordable  levels  of  stamp  duty  on  debt  assignments;  and  (iii)  allowing \nrepossession  of  corporate  bonds.7 In  addition,  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  is \nproviding the regulatory framework for the secondary corporate debt market. RBI has also \ndrafted guidelines on the usage of credit derivatives (specifically credit default swaps).8 \n \n9.  Illiquid secondary markets put banks at risk by constraining their ability to hive-off risk \nand have adverse implications for infrastructure financing. \n \n(i)  Insufficient market maturity and absence of benchmarks. A weak secondary \nmarket leads to illiquid interest rate derivatives and hedging mechanisms. In \nresponse  to  these  constraints,  banks  generally  charge  floating  rates  which \neffectively makes loans short in duration instruments. \n(ii)  Lack of investor interest. Given investor comfort with protected investments, \ninvestors are unwilling to accept a risk of decline in the value of assets in the \nabsence of liquid secondary markets. On the other hand, institutional investors, \nsuch as insurance and pension funds, have investment criteria for credit ratings \n(minimum AA) constraining them to invest in government securities.9 \n \n10.  Further,  the  bulk  of  corporate  issuances  belong  to  the  public  sector  (81%),  in  the \nFY1996\u2013FY2006 period through private placements (on the back of a government guarantee). \nA major reason for low private sector mobilization is regulations that allow market accessibility \nonly to top-rated companies. Of the total issuance of $14.11 billion in FY2004, $13.70 billion \nwas credit-rated, suggesting that credit rating is necessary for market access.10  \n \n11.  Despite reforms and measure to improve the regulatory environment and develop long-\nterm debt markets, policy, institutional, and market gaps remain as financial and infrastructure \nsector-wide reforms are still ongoing. The existence of several interlocking factors (regulatory \nand  policy  gaps,  the  conversion  of  DFIs,  illiquid  capital  markets,  higher  risk  profile  of \n                                                 \n5  Long-term issuances of government securities are usually absorbed by pension and insurance funds and held until \nmaturity.  \n6  High Level Committee on Corporate Bonds and Securitization (2005).  \n7  This measure is to give investors who have illiquid corporate bonds an opportunity to recycle them. \n8 Source: RBI, DBOD. NO.BP.1409.157/2006-07, 16 May 2007. \n9 At present, except for raising funds for infrastructure projects, banks are not allowed to issue bonds with long \nmaturities. Thus, there are not enough issuers of bonds. Restrictions have also been imposed on the investment \nactivity of life insurance companies and mutual funds and these restrictions are one of the reasons for the lack of \ngrowth in bond investment.  \n10 Investors in corporate debt instruments are excessively safety-conscious, as can be noted from the fact that there \nis hardly any demand for paper which is rated below AA or its equivalent. Debt instruments with credit rating of \nBBB (or its equivalent) and above is considered investment grade.  \n ", "50  Appendix 4 \ninfrastructure subprojects, inadequate risk capital,11 and suboptimal risk allocation) requires an \ninnovative response to address market gaps. The establishment of IIFCL and the elements of its \noperating  paradigm  (the  Scheme)  are  a  reflection  of  the  Government\u2019s  response  to these \ninterlocking  factors  and  a  part  of  the  ongoing  reform  agenda  in  the  financial  sector  and \ninfrastructure space.   \n \nD.  Market Justification for IIFCL\u2019s Operating Model \n \n12.  The key elements of IIFCL\u2019s Scheme have a specific role in promoting an enabling \nenvironment for PPP and infrastructure development, and filling the gaps as described in para. \n11. Specifically, these are described below. \n \n13.  Guarantee Arrangement. Through its operating paradigm, IIFCL fills the gaps in the \nmarket for infrastructure finance. The individual investor in India is very risk averse and, even at \nvery large negative real returns, prefers risk-free investments to risky ones. The same is the \ncase for pension and insurance funds. Thus, there is a need for intermediaries and markets that \nare able to perform the three functions of risk, maturity, and duration transformation, and attract \nfunds  from  the  above-mentioned  sources  by  providing  an  additional  layer  of  credit \nenhancement. In this context, government guarantees, as provided to IIFCL, can be a viable \nmechanism of providing the required risk capital in an environment where the Government is \nseeking to remain within its fiscal limits.12 Typically such credit enhancements should come from \nthe market, through specialized guarantee mechanisms or credit derivatives. However, this is \nnot possible in the current Indian context as the markets are not fully developed and the reform \nprocess is ongoing.  \n  \n14.  As suggested above (para. 13), the justification for the guarantee comes from the state \nof available risk mitigation mechanisms. Credit derivatives have not become fully established in \nIndia while banks are not permitted to trade in equity and commodity derivatives.13 Further, the \nmarket for interest rate derivatives is limited as there are strict restrictions on the participation of \nbanks in exchange-traded derivatives. While over-the-counter derivatives may be traded by \nbanks, public sector banks are largely absent from the market. Insurance companies (the other \nnatural  counterparties  to  infrastructure  providers)  have  not  received  permission  from  the \n                                                 \n11 The risk capital required in the infrastructure sector can be understood as the explicit capital brought in as equity by \nthe subproject sponsors and the implicit risk capital provided by the lenders to subprojects. Implicit risk capital is \ntherefore the credit enhancement provided to retail and long-term investors to draw in funds for infrastructure. \nImplicit capital providers seek to manage their risk-return reward by ensuring availability of adequate explicit capital \nand diversification across various projects. Given this profile of explicit capital, greater flow of risk capital can be \nensured by removing the effects of controllable uncertainties in the policy environment and making available the \nbenefits of diversification through alternate mechanisms. New sources of this risk capital can be sourced by (i) \nproviding risk guarantees (through IIFCL\u2019s Scheme), (ii) the formation of highly capitalized financial intermediaries \n(unlikely in a fiscally constrained regime), and (iii) encouraging securitization transactions.  \n 12   In  the  United  States  (US)  markets,  monocline  insurance  companies  like  MBIA  Inc.  provide  such  credit \nenhancements for urban local bodies and other borrowers. MBIA is a US-based financial guarantee insurance \ncompany and is rated AAA by ratings agency Standard&Poor\u2019s. It has been providing AAA credit enhancement for \nmunicipal and structured debt obligations since 1974. It has guaranteed more than 35,000 municipal and asset-\nbacked transactions with a total value exceeding $1.5 trillion.\n13 As a consequence, banks which have lent against the securit y of shares have been unable to hedge their exposure \nin falling markets and have lost money. Further, insurance companies which largely have very long duration and \nfixed income liabilities have lost value almost every month as interest rates have fallen and they have been unable \nto hedge their exposure. Finally, banks and DFIs which have lent to companies engaged in commodity businesses, \nsuch as cement, paper, and steel have been unable to lay off the underlying commodity exposures in the \ninternational market and have lost value as commodity cycles have turned against them. Studies suggest that \ninterest rate risk exposure inherent in the balance sheet of most banks is very high. \n ", "Appendix 4  51\nInsurance Regulatory and Development Authority14 to enter the market in the absence of credit \nenhancing instruments. \n \n15.  Thinly capitalized entities from a risk-weighted perspective that focus on infrastructure \nfinance are unlikely to maintain viability if they finance subprojects without exposure limits. \nThese limits will impose a budget constraint on subprojects given long gestation periods and \nlength of debt ammortizations of subprojects. Further, no single entity will have sufficient capital \nto  meet  all  infrastructure  finance  requirements.  Thus,  spreading  the  risk  amongst  a  large \nnumber of investors for each of whom this represents only a small exposure is the only way this \nrisk capital can be sourced. In the context of IIFCL\u2019s guarantee, this amounts to commoditizing \nrisk as a public good (as it is borne by the Government). This credit enhancement mechanism \nstems from the recommendations of the Patil committee.  \n  \n16.  Exposure Limit. By financing only 20% of the capital costs of a project, IIFCL will \nfunction as part of a lending consortium and will only finance projects deemed by the market to \nbe commercially viable. The limited project financing provided by IIFCL will ensure that it builds \na diversified portfolio and does not suffer from a lumpy investment profile that caused distress to \nIDFC earlier. In this respect, IIFCL will benefit from the PPP development initiatives currently \nunderway. Thus, IIFCL functions under a different paradigm from earlier DFIs, and does not \nundertake subproject origination and does not have directed lending requirements. \n \n17.  Efficient Capital Allocation. The presence of IIFCL results in efficient capital allocation \nin financial institutions engaged in infrastructure finance. With IIFCL providing an independent \nsource of funding, financial institutions may take exposures to projects in line with their risk \nreturn  capital  allocation  framework.  While  the  combined  exposures  of  financiers  may  be \ninsufficient to meet project needs, an additional independent source of funding through IIFCL \nwould likely fill the financing gap. The optimal capital allocation and risk-based return on capital \npromoted  through  this  framework  will  provide  additional  benchmarks  for  the  pricing  of \ninfrastructure risk in the market.     \n \n18.  Long-Term Financing. IIFCL will offer long-term financing for tenors not currently being \noffered by the market. This is expected to improve the bidding mechanism and the quality of \nbids. As project sponsors will have better cash flow projections, the bidding process will be \nfacilitated and will not normally include anomalies on notional hedging costs to account for re-\npricing uncertainties. Long tenor financing of over 20-year maturities will enable IIFCL to take an \nexposure to projects in line with the length of the concession agreements. Thus, potential \ninvestors in subproject SPVs/concessionaires will be provided with an additional layer of comfort \ngiven debt exposure to a subproject that matches the length of equity exposure. Thus, IIFCL will \nalso catalyze explicit risk capital (private equity share in subproject SPVs) in addition to its other \nmarket enhancing roles. IIFCL will onlend to subprojects based on market borrowing. Thus, \nunlike the older DFIs, IIFCL does not have subsidized financing sources.      \n \n19.  Establishing Market Benchmarks. The risk-based pricing of subloans to subprojects \nwill establish benchmarks for long-term pricing. This will form the basis through which long-term \n                                                 \n14  As per the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority regulations, life insurance and general insurance \ncompanies are required to invest minimum amounts (20% for general insurance and 25% for life insurance) in \ndifferent combinations of state and central government securities (without any quota for state governments). \nFurther, while there are stipulations for investments in infrastructure and social sectors (15% for life insurance and \n10% for general insurance sectors), the stipulation of a minimum rating of AA for such investments makes \navailability of such funds very limited. If such stipulation cannot be removed, the case for a First Loss Deficiency \nGuarantee backed investment becomes compelling. \n ", "52  Appendix 4 \ndebt can be structured for project finance by sourcing financing from insurance and pension \nfunds. The critical element of this mechanism is the pricing of loans given that IIFCL does not \nhave sufficient capital to price loans on a Risk Adjusted Return on Capital15 principle. Given this \nconstraint, an efficient pricing principle, as a first approximation, could be to benchmark loans \nagainst spreads of corporate paper of similar risk characteristics. This could be achieved by \nobserving corporate paper that resembles the risk profiles for the SPV being considered for \nfinancing. If similar paper is unavailable in the domestic market (given limited market liquidity), \nthe international market will be assessed for comparable paper and adjustments made for \ncountry spread differential. \n \nE.  Role of IIFCL in Promoting PPP \n \n20.  IIFCL will seek to leverage the available resources in the market to improve the viability \nof projects by reducing financing risk. In this context, IIFCL has developed partnerships with \nproject developers such as IDFC and IL&FS as well as with concession awarding agencies such \nas NHAI. The role played by IIFCL in PPP development is provided in Figure A4.1.  \n \n21.  As can be seen from Figure A4.1 below, IIFCL will play a complementary role in the \ninfrastructure finance market. The ways by which it addresses market gaps for encouraging \nPPP  are  as  follows  (i)  draw-in  equity  funds;  (ii)  provide  long-term  debt;  (iii)  partner  with \ncomplementary  project  development  agencies;  and  (iv)  promote  capital  efficiency  in  the \nconsortium institutions. Thus, IIFCL\u2019s presence in the market allows the financing of projects \nthat would otherwise have been denied financing. The role played by IIFCL can be further seen \nfrom the way which PPP-type subprojects are brought to the market and opreationalized. This is \nprovided in Figure A4.2 below. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n15 As it became clearer that banks needed to add an appropriate capital charge in the pricing process, the concept of \nrisk adjusting the return or risk adjusting the capital arose. The value-producing capacity of an asset (or a \nbusiness) is expressed as a ratio that allows comparisons to be made between assets (or businesses) of varying \nsizes and risk characteristics. The ratio is based either on the size of the asset or the size of the capital allocated to \nit. When an institution can observe asset prices directly (and/or infer risk from observable asset prices), then it can \ndetermines how much capital to hold based on the volatility of the asset. Risk Adjusted Return on Capital principle \nallocates a capital charge to a transaction or a line of business at an amount equal to the maximum expected loss \n(at a 99% confidence level) over a year on an after-tax basis. As may be expected, the higher the volatility of the \nreturns, the more capital is allocated. The higher capital allocation means that the transaction has to generate cash \nflows large enough to offset the volatility of returns, which results from the credit risk, market risk, and other risks \ntaken.  \n ", "", "54  Appendix 4 \n22.  As described in the above schematic, IIFCL is being positioned as an apex agency for \ninfrastructure development. It has partnership arrangements with (i) project developers such as \nIDFC and IL&FS to provide debt financing for projects developed by them; and (ii) NHAI to fund \nprojects being developed by SPVs which have been granted concessions by NHAI in the road \nsector. It has also invested in private equity funds along with Blackstone Group and CitiGroup \nwhich will invest in SPVs. IIFCL\u2019s presence in the equity fund are expected to catalyze other \ninvestors to invest in the fund. This fund will provide the market with explicit risk capital.  \n \nF.  Assessment of IIFCL\u2019s Operations \n \n23.  In a relatively short period, IIFCL has achieved a market presence and has built up a \nportfolio of projects. IIFCL has sanctioned funds for 64 projects and another 60\u201370 are expected \nto come into its portfolio in the next financial year. A list of sanctioned projects is provided in \nSupplementary Appendix D.  \n \n24.  As a result of the guarantee, IIFCL has the highest credit rating in the domestic market \n(AAA). Further, on the basis of its market standing, IIFCL has issued a 10-year paper at 80 \nbasis points above comparable government security and around 15 basis points below other \nprevailing  AAA-rated  paper  for  similar  maturities.  Thus,  IIFCL  appears  to  be  successfully \nleveraging the guarantee to access the market at competitive rates and investors have accepted \nthe quality of the guarantee.  \n \n25.  Taken as a whole, IIFCL\u2019s balance sheet is expected to grow to around $6 billion\u2013$8 \nbillion in the next few years. Based on this understanding of IIFCL\u2019s operations and its role in \ninfrastructure financing, a consortium of development partners, including the Japan Bank for \nInternational  Cooperation  for  \u00a570.5  billion  ($600  million),  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr  Wiederaufbau  of \nGermany for \u20ac280 million ($395 million), and the World Bank for $500 million and the are \nconsidering providing IIFCL with a line of credit for onlending to eligible projects. The line of \ncredit will complement IIFCL\u2019s other sources of borrowings including (i) an issuance of a $127 \nmillion bond (10-year bullet repayment) in the domestic market in September 2006; (ii) a $51 \nmillion loan from the State Bank of Travencore; and (iii) $26 million from other state-owned \nbanks. IIFCL is also contemplating accessing the international capital markets with a $500 \nmillion bond issuance.

Conclusion \n \n26.  IIFCL\u2019s  role  should  be  seen  in  the  context  of  the  overall  market  for  infrastructure \nfinancing in India occupying a niche position in the market by channeling long-term funds to the \ninfrastructure sector and filling significant institutional and market-related gaps. Through IIFCL, \nthe Government seeks to play the role of facilitator in infrastructure financing, and is expected to \nfunction as a bridge between the needs of the borrowers and lenders or investors by providing \nan  additional  layer  of  credit  enhancement  to  channel  liquidity.  Going  forward,  market \ndevelopment is a key to widening the investor base and bringing more PPP projects into the \nmarket. \n \n ", "56  Appendix 5 \nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK FOR  \nTHE INDIA INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE COMPANY LIMITED  \n \nA.  Introduction \n \n1.  The India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) is a unique entity established \nby the Government of India (the Government) under the Companies Act, 1956. As such, its \ncorporate governance structure is dictated by the provisions of the Act. IIFCL is also subject to \nthe provisions of the Depositories Act, 1996.1 The application of the Companies Act, 1956 to \nIIFCL  is  laid  down  in  IIFCL\u2019s  Memorandum  and  Articles  of  Association  (Supplementary \nAppendix F). IIFCL\u2019s operating model and functional modalities are provided in its Scheme \nwhich articulates IIFCL\u2019s business case and provides functional guidance under the provisions \nof the Companies Act, 1956. Finally, its comprehensive business plan (CBP) provides its road \nmap for adopting best practices.  \n \nB.  Implications of the Companies Act, 1956 for IIFCL  \n \n2.  The Companies Act, 1956, amended from time to time, is the most important piece of \nlegislation that empowers the central government to regulate the formation and functioning of \ncompanies. The Companies Act is administered by the central government through the Ministry \nof Corporate Affairs and the offices of bodies such as the Registrar of Companies,2 Official \nLiquidators, Public Trustee, Company Law Board, and Director of Inspection. \n \n3.  The Companies Act, 1956 states that a company is \"a company formed and registered \nunder the Act or an existing company, i.e., a company formed or registered under any of the \nprevious company laws.\" The basic objectives of the law are to \n \n(i)  Enforce a minimum standard of good behavior and business honesty in company \npromotion and management.  \n(ii)  Provide due recognition of the legitimate interest of shareholders and creditors \nand of the duty of managements not to jeopardize those interests.  \n(iii)  Provide effective control and voice in the management for shareholders.  \n(iv)  Ensure fair and true disclosure of the company\u2019s affairs in its annual published \nbalance sheet and profit and loss accounts.  \n(v)  Ensure adoption of proper standards of accounting and auditing.  \n(vi)  Accord  recognition  to  the  rights  of  shareholders  to  receive  reasonable \ninformation and facilities for exercising an intelligent judgment with reference to \nthe management.  \n(vii)  Prescribe  a  ceiling  on  the  share  of  profits  payable  to  management  as \nremuneration for services rendered.  \n(viii)  Institute a system of checks and balances on transactions where there is a \npossibility of conflict of duty and interest.  \n                                                 \n1   Depository means a company formed and registered under the Companies Act, 1956 and which has been granted \na certificate of registration to act as a depository under the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act, 1992. \n2  Registrars of companies appointed under Section 609 of the Companies Act covering the various states and union \nterritories are vested with the primary duty of registering companies floated in the respective states and the union \nterritories and ensuring that such companies comply with statutory requirements under the Act. These offices \nfunction as a registry of records relating to the companies registered with them and the records are available for \ninspection  by  members  of  public  on  payment  of  the  prescribed  fee.  The  central  government  exercises \nadministrative control over these offices through the respective regional directors. \n ", "Appendix 5  57\n(ix)  Provide investigation into the affairs of any company managed in a manner \noppressive to a minority of the shareholders or prejudicial to the interest of the \ncompany as a whole.  \n(x)  Enforcement  of  the  performance  of  their  duties  by  those  engaged  in  the \nmanagement  of  public  companies  or  subsidiaries  of  public  companies  by \nproviding sanctions in the case of breach and subjecting management to more \nrestrictive provisions of law applicable to public companies.  \n \n4.  Important amendments introduced in FY2000 to Sections 217 and 292 of the Companies \nAct (made applicable from 13 December 2000) set the tone for corporate governance in the \ncountry. The changes relate to paras. 5\u201310 below. \n \nC.  Directors\u2019 Responsibility Statement (Section 217 [2AA]) \n \n5.  With a view to increasing the accountability of directors, a company is required to include \na Directors\u2019 Responsibility Statement in the Report of the Board of Directors which should affirm \nthe following. \n \n(i)  Annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting \nstandards with proper explanation relating to material departures. \n(ii)  The selection and application of accounting policies by the directors is consistent \nand prudent so as to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the \ncompany. \n(iii)  Proper and sufficient care has been taken by the directors for the maintenance of \nadequate accounting records for safeguarding the assets of the company and for \npreventing and detecting frauds and irregularities. \n(iv)  The annual accounts of the company are prepared on an ongoing concern basis. \n \nD.  Formation and Role of Audit Committee \n \n6.  Section 292-A of the Companies Act, 1956 requires every limited public company having \npaid-up capital of not less than $1.27 million to constitute an audit committee at the board level. \nThe audit committee should have a minimum of three directors and two thirds of the total \nnumber of audit committee members shall be the directors other than managing or full-time \ndirectors. The terms of reference of the audit committee include all matters related to financial \nreporting and the audit of financial reports, including efficacy of the internal control system. The \nstatutory  requirement  of  having  audit  committees  brings  into  sharp  focus  the  primacy  of \nindependent directors in corporate governance and the critical role of financial reporting in \nsatisfying the expectations of stakeholders. \n \n7.  The  second  amendment  (FY2002) 3  of  the  Companies  Act,  1956  reflects  the \nGovernment\u2019s response to the changing business environment. Amongst other things it (i) \nseeks to provide more transparency in corporate governance; (ii) places more responsibility and \naccountability  on  company  directors;  (iii)  makes  small  companies  comply  with  accounting \ndiscipline; and (iv) protects the interest of small investors and depositors and debenture holders.  \n \n8.  Further,  the  CBP  stipulates  that  IIFCL  will  constitute  an  audit  committee  having \nnonexecutive directors as members, and a 50% representation of independent directors. At \n                                                 \n3 The second amendment (FY2002) of the Companies Act, 1956 came into effect on 13 January 2003.  \n \n ", "58  Appendix 5 \nleast one member of the audit committee will possess accounting or financial management \nexpertise. \n \n9.  The role of the audit committee will primarily include the following. \n \n(i)  Oversight of IIFCL\u2019s financial reporting process and the disclosure of its financial \ninformation  to  ensure  that  the  financial  statement  is  correct,  sufficient,  and \ncredible. \n(ii)  Reviewing with the management the adequacy of internal control systems. \n(iii)  Reviewing the adequacy of the internal audit function. \n(iv)  Reviewing the company\u2019s financial and risk management policies. \n \n10.  In addition, IIFCL undertakes three levels of audit (i) concurrent internal audit by a firm of \nchartered accountants, (ii) statutory audit by an independent firm of chartered accountants \nappointed by the comptroller and auditor general of India, and (iii) supplementary audit by the \ncomptroller and auditor general of India. \n \nE.  Corporate Governance Structure of IIFCL \n \n11.  The peak policy-making body of IIFCL is the Empowered Committee of Secretaries \nwhich is authorized to make changes to the Scheme. The committee is independent of IIFCL\u2019s \nboard, with minimal duplication of membership, and includes one member (secretary) from the \nline ministry which will be impacted by, or which has sought changes to, the Scheme (i.e., the \nempowered  committee  could  have  one  floating  member  based  on  the  subject  under \nconsideration). This mechanism ensures separation between policy making and implementation \nand minimizes potential conflict of interest and the possibility of structuring the Scheme to favor \na particular subsector or lending modality. Further to the Empowered Committee, an Oversight \nCommittee has been established to implement the regulatory process. The composition of the \noversight committee is independent and distinct of the Empowered Committee, and the two \ncommittees do not have any common members.   \n \n12.  As per IIFCL\u2019s Memorandum and Articles of Association, the number of directors will not \nbe less than three nor more than thirteen, or such number as may be determined from time to \ntime by IIFCL in its general meeting in accordance with the aforesaid limit and provisions of the \nCompanies  Act,  1956.  As  per  the  Memorandum  and  Articles  of  Association,  the  board  of \ndirectors will consist of the following. \n \n(i)  Two full-time directors (one of whom shall be chairman and managing director) \nwho shall not be liable to retire on rotation. \n(ii)  Two  directors  who  may  be  officials  of  the  Government,  nominated  by  the \nGovernment. \n(iii)  Three part-time directors who will be experts from outside the Government. \n(iv)  Such number of directors elected by the members other than the Government, as \nfollows. \na.  Where  the  total  amount  of  equity  share  capital  issued  to  such \nshareholders  is  25%  or  less  of  the  total  issued  equity  capital,  two \ndirectors. \nb.  Where  the  total  amount  of  equity  share  capital  issued  to  such \nshareholders is more than 25% but less than 40% of the total equity \nshare capital, four directors. \n ", "Appendix 5  59\nc.  Where  the  total  amount  of  equity  share  capital  issued  to  such \nshareholders  is  40%  or  more  of  the  total  issued  equity  capital,  six \ndirectors. \n \n13.  Further, as per Chapter 10 of its CBP, IIFCL will adopt best practice which requires a fair \npercentage of independent directors4 to serve the following purposes. \n \n(i)  Independent  directors  appointed  from  varied  fields  of  specialization  and \nknowledge will bring expertise and competence to IIFCL. \n(ii)  IIFCL  is  fully  owned  by  the  Government.  However,  given  the  magnitude  of \ninfrastructure projects to be financed by IIFCL, the Government stakeholders of \nIIFCL would be from different departments and ministries. Thus, independent \ndirectors  who  are  in  a  position  to  make  objective  decisions  are  required  to \nrepresent various nongovernment stakeholders.  \n \n14.  Powers of Directors. As per IIFCL\u2019s Memorandum and Articles of Association, the \nboard will exercise the following powers on behalf of the company and it will do so only by \nmeans of resolutions passed at its meetings. \n \n(i)  Make calls on shareholders in respect of money unpaid on their shares. \n(ii)  Authorize the buy-back of shares. \n(iii)  Issue debentures. \n(iv)  Borrow money by means other than debentures. \n(v)  Invest the funds of the company. \n(vi)  Make loans. \n \n15.  Provided that a resolution is passed at a meeting, the board may delegate to any \ncommittee of directors, the chairman, and such other persons as the board may specify, the full-\ntime director, or any other officer of the company, the powers specified in items (iv), (v), and (vi) \nto the extent specified in the Companies Act, 1956.    \n \n16.  Board  Procedures.  As  per  the  CBP,  the  following  prudent  board  procedures  are \nproposed. \n \n(i)  Board meetings will be held at least four times a year, with a maximum interval of \n4 months between any two meetings. \n(ii)  A director shall not be a member of more than 10 committees or act as chairman \nof more than five committees across all companies in which he or she is a \ndirector. \n(iii)  The information provided to the board periodically shall include, but not be limited \nto \n(a)  annual operating and resources plans; \n(b)  quarterly results; \n(c)  minutes of meetings of the audit committee and other board committees; \n(d)  information on recruitment and remuneration of senior management; \n(e)  details  of  any  collaboration  agreements,  signed  memoranda  of \nunderstandings; and \n                                                 \n4 The CBP suggests one third of the board shall consist of independent directors. \n ", "60  Appendix 5 \n(f)  credit risk and portfolio analysis, market risk reports including interest rate \nsensitivity statements, and statements on foreign exchange exposure and \nhedging. \n \n17.  Disclosures.  The  CBP  emphasizes  transparency  in  IIFCL  operations  through  an \nappropriate disclosure and communication plan as follows.  \n \n(i)  All pecuniary relationship or transactions of the nonexecutive directors with IIFCL \nwill be disclosed in the annual report. In addition, compensation levels of all the \ndirectors will be disclosed. \n(ii)  Management will make disclosure to the board relating to all material financial \nand commercial transactions where they have personal interest that may have a \npotential conflict with the interest of the company at large. \n(iii)  Management will provide a clear description of each material contingent liability \nand its risks to be accompanied by auditors\u2019 comments. \n(iv)  IIFCL will aim to include (as part of the directors\u2019 report in the annual report or as \nan  addition  thereto)  a  management  discussion  on,  among  other  things,  (a) \nfinancial performance, (b) risks and concerns, (c) internal control systems and \ntheir adequacy, and (d) material developments in human resources including the \nnumber of people employed. \n(v)  IIFCL shall present its corporate governance framework in a separate section in \nits annual report along with a compliance report. \n \n18.  IIFCL\u2019s Management Structure. The organization of IIFCL is separated to ensure that \nloan appraisal, resource mobilization and treasury, and loan recovery functions are separate. \nThe  functional  segregation  is  based  on  minimizing  conflict  of  interest  and  ensuring \nindependence  in  loan  evaluation,  pricing,  and  risk  evaluation  (e.g.,  the  risk  management \nfunction has no lending targets and performance is assessed on the basis of documentation and \ndata  integrity).  Further,  the  responsible  officers  have  been  selected  on  the  basis  of  their \nexperience in the banking sector and are drawn from various commercial banks.

Introduction \n \n1.  The  Environmental  and  Social  Safeguards  Framework  (ESSF)  comprises  the \nEnvironmental Management System (EMS) and the Social Safeguards Framework (SSF). The \nprovisions for environmental and social safeguards and assessment and mitigation measures \ncontained in the EMS and SSF are applicable for all subprojects financed by resources from \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) by India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL), either \nfor direct lending or refinance operations and to both public and private sector companies. All \nsubborrowers interested in seeking financial assistance from IIFCL, where finance from ADB is \nused, will therefore need to conduct business in a manner that allows IIFCL to be compliant with \nthis EMS and SSF. \n \n1.  Purpose of the EMS \n \n2.  The EMS defines policy procedures, roles, and responsibilities for managing adverse \nenvironmental impacts/risks due to subprojects that are financed by IIFCL. The EMS has been \nprepared as part of IIFCL\u2019s commitment to comply with Government of India (the Government) \npolicies, law and regulations, as well as, to follow the development partners\u2019 (e.g., ADB, World \nBank [WB], Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau [KfW], and Japan Bank for International Cooperation \n[JBIC]) safeguard policies.  \n \n2.  Purpose of the SSF \n \n3.  The  SSF  outlines  policies,  procedures,  roles,  and  responsibilities  for  managing \ninvoluntary resettlement (IR) impacts and risks, and effects on indigenous (tribal) peoples of \nsubprojects that are financed by IIFCL using ADB funds. The SSF is part of IIFCL\u2019s commitment \nto  comply  with  the  Government\u2019s  policies,  laws  and  regulations,  and  to  comply  with  the \nsafeguards policies of the development partners.  \n \nB.  Environmental Management System \n \n1.  Objectives  \n \n4.  The objectives of EMS are  \n \n(i)  To avoid and minimize adverse environmental impacts from subprojects financed \nby IIFCL using ADB funds, especially in environmentally sensitive locations. \n(ii)  To  ensure  that  adverse  environmental  impacts  are  well-mitigated  to  achieve \napplicable environmental standards. \n(iii)  To  comply  with  applicable  Government,  state  laws  and  regulations,  and \nenvironmental safeguards requirements of development partners.  \n(iv)  To provide guidance to lead banks/designated lead syndicator and subborrowers \nin preparing subprojects for appraisal at IIFCL and in conducting subsequent \nmonitoring, reporting, and in undertaking corrective actions.   \n \n5.  IIFCL\u2019s  EMS  is  based  on  the  Government\u2019s  Environmental  Policy  and  Regulatory \nFramework and considers the environmental and social safeguards (ESS) requirements of the \ndevelopment partners.  \n \n ", "70  Appendix 10 \n \n2.  Structure of IIFCL\u2019s EMS \n \n6.  As per the ESS requirements in the development partners (especially World Bank [WB] \nand ADB), IIFCL falls into \u201cFinancial Intermediary\u201d category and is obligated to develop and \noperate  an  EMS  and  develop  adequate  institutional  capacity  to  ensure  satisfactory \nimplementation of the environmental safeguards of the development partners.  \n \n7.  Accordingly,  an  EMS  needs  to  be  developed,  guided  by  environmental  policy  and \nprocedures that will ensure that all subprojects processed and financed by IIFCL are compliant \nwith  applicable  environmental  laws  and  regulations,  and  do  not  result  in  unmitigated  and \nadverse  environmental  impacts.  Given  the  requirement  of  compliance  and  considering  the \ncomprehensiveness  of  the  Government\u2019s  Environment  Impact  Assessment  (EIA)  and \nEnvironment  Clearance  (EC)  system,  IIFCL\u2019s  EMS  has  been  developed  around  the \nGovernment\u2019s environmental policy and regulatory framework. IIFCL\u2019s EMS follows subproject \ncategorization as per the Government (e.g., A/B1/B2) as well as its processes, scoping, public \nhearing, review, and monitoring requirements. It mainstreams key outcomes like Environmental \nManagement Plans (EMP) in the project design and implementation.  \n \n3.  Operational Steps of IIFCL\u2019s EMS \n \n8.  The  Government\u2019s  Ministry  of  Environment  and  Forest\u2019s  (MoEF)  notification  on  EC \nfollows a subproject classification scheme as A, B1, and B2. This classification factors project \ntype, size, and sensitivity of location. IIFCL\u2019s EMS will use this categorization to prioritize the \nappraisal and monitoring process followed by the EMS.  \n \n9.  Subprojects under category A and B1 require EIA and are processed for EC at MoEF at \nthe central level by the State Department of Environment at the state-level. Category B2 does \nnot require EIA but needs information to be submitted in a prescribed format to the State \nDepartment of Environment for review. Subprojects under category B1 may get re-categorized \ninto category A if general conditions on site sensitivity are violated that consider site sensitivity. \n \n10.  The operational steps of IIFCL\u2019s EMS consider two scenarios. \n \n(i)  Case A. Subprojects that have been appraised and agreed to be financed before \nestablishment and operation of EMS.  \n(ii)  Case B. Subprojects that have not yet committed for finance and will undergo \nEMS. \n \n11.  For case A subprojects, the following steps will be taken. \n \n(i)  Categorize subprojects as per A/B1/B2 following guidelines of MoEF.  \n(ii)  Categorize subprojects as per ESSF guidelines. If more than one development \npartner is involved, the strictest guidelines will apply. \n(iii)  In  the  event  of  a  difference  in  categorization  carried  out  by  MoEF\u2019s  EIA \nnotification and categorization by ESSF, the stricter guidelines will be followed. \n(iv)  Wherever there is no clear guidance available in MoEF\u2019s EIA notification for \nsubproject  categorization,  then  the  ESSF  scheme  of  categorization  will  be \nfollowed. \n(v)  During review on environmental compliance, focus will be on verifying consent \nfrom  State  Pollution  Control  Board  to  establish  and  operate  the  subproject, \nenvironmental  and  forest  clearances  from  State  Department  of ", "Appendix 10  71\n \nEnvironment/MoEF and costal regulation authorities, and whether processes and \nprocedures, relating to public consultation and disclosure are followed. IIFCL will \nensure that subproject proponent conduct consultation with affected groups and \nlocal  nongovernment  organizations  (NGO)  at  least  twice  during  subproject \npreparation\u2014once during the early stage of executing agency (EA)\u2019s preparation \nand when the draft EA report is available. Consultation should be conducted \nduring implementation. IIFCL will ensure that the subborrower provides relevant \ninformation on the subproject\u2019s environmental issues in form and language(s) \naccessible to those being consulted. IIFCL will also ensure compliance with the \n120-day  disclosure  requirement  for  category  A  or  B  subprojects  deemed \nsensitive.  Compliance  should  also  address  conformity  with  standards  and \napproaches recommended by Pollution Prevention and Abatement Handbook of \nthe WB. In case the subproject EA report recommends adoption of alternative \nemission levels and approaches for pollution prevention and abatement to reflect \nnational legislation and local conditions, the EA report must justify the levels and \nthe approaches chosen for the subproject. \n(vi)  IIFCL will identify gaps, if any, on environmental compliance. If there are no \ngaps, EIA reports and adequacy of EMPs will be reviewed. For category A and \nB1 subprojects field visits will be conducted to check for compliance. \n(vii)  In the event of non-compliance, IIFCL will direct subborrowers to take action to \nattain compliance. Disbursements will be withheld until compliance is achieved.    \n(viii)  IIFCL will review compliance measures to monitor if they are satisfactorily met. If \nmeasures  are  consistently  unsatisfactory,  further  disbursements  will  be \ncancelled.    \n(ix)  For compliant subprojects, if review of environment management plan shows \nappropriate reflection in subproject costs, legal documents will be updated to \nreflect applicability of IIFCL\u2019s EMS as binding during the period of engagement. \nAppropriate approval of the board will be taken.  \n(x)  If  review  of  EMP  suggests  inadequate  reflection  in  subproject  costs,  the \nsubproject implementation plan will be updated as well as the financial appraisal \nto reflect the new EMP. Commercial viability of the subproject will be reassessed.  \n(xi)  IIFCL will obtain board approval for revisions. Legal documents will be updated to \nreflect applicability of IIFCL\u2019s EMS as binding during the engagement period. \n \n12.

Keeping this in mind and considering the operational steps of EMS, it is proposed to set \nup an Environmental and Social Management Unit (ESMU) at IIFCL. ESMU will comprise full-\ntime staff that are either on deputation to IIFCL or are directly recruited. Staff should have \nadequate qualification in conducting environmental and social assessments of subprojects.   \n \n5.  Conduct of Annual Environmental Audit and its Disclosure \n \n16.  IIFCL  will  conduct  annual  environmental  and  social  audit  through  independent \nconsultants.  The  audit  process  will  consider  subproject  categories  for  better  focus  and \noptimization. Consultants will conduct an annual environmental and social audit with the help of \nSenior Environmental and Social Specialists using a combination of data reported by lead \nsyndicator/subborrowers and field visits.  \n \n6.  Reporting to Development Partners\u2019 Requirements  \n \n17.  Apart from the annual environmental audit reports, IIFCL will need to prepare reports, \nfrom  time  to  time,  as  required  by  development  partners.  While  making  Periodic  Finance \nRequest to ADB, for instance, reporting on environmental performance of past subprojects and \ncorrection action plans may be required apart from management of environmental issues of \nproposed subprojects that are under preparation.   \n \n18.  Such reports will be prepared by the ESMU of IIFCL in consultation with development \npartners building on the regular monitoring and review process under EMS as well as annual \nenvironmental audit.  \n \nC.

The primary objective of the SSF is to provide guidance to subborrowers in preparing \nsubprojects for appraisal by IIFCL and in conducting subsequent monitoring, reporting, and in \nundertaking corrective actions. In such cases, relevant Government legislation and policies \nwould apply as would either or both of the lenders\u2019 IR and IP policies (as reflected in this \nframework). \n \n20.  Other key objectives for this SSF are to ensure that subproject-affected people benefit \nfrom the proposed subprojects and are consulted on the subproject throughout its life. \n \n21.  The IIFCL will ensure that IR impacts of any subproject submitted for financing under the \nfacility are dealt with in accordance with the following. \n \n(i)  Applicable central and state laws and regulations governing land acquisition, \ncompensation, relocation, and resettlement.  \n(ii)  IR policies of the development partners. \n \n \n \n ", "76  Appendix 10 \n \n2.  Outline of Social Safeguard Activities \n \na.  Two Pathways for Social Safeguards Due Diligence \n \n22.  Two pathways for social safeguards due diligence are established. The first applies to all \nsubprojects not yet committed to by IIFCL at the time of the functioning of the ESMU in IIFCL \n(within 90 days of its establishment). The procedures for such subprojects are set out below. \n \n(i)  Screening of subprojects for resettlement effects and impact on tribal peoples. \n(ii)  Preparation of resettlement plan (short or full), if necessary, and submission as \npart of the PIM. \n(iii)  Preparation of Tribal Development Plan (TDP) (short or full), if necessary, and \nsubmission as part of PIM. \n(iv)  Appraisal of Resettlement Plan (RP) and/or TDP, revisions, if necessary. \n(v)  Setting of loan conditionality to include social (resettlement and tribal peoples) \nsafeguard covenants. \n(vi)  Revision of RP and/or TDP on completion of detailed subproject design. \n(vii)  Implementation of RP and/or TDP. \n(viii)  Monitoring of RP and TDP. \n(ix)  Subproject closure shall be linked to satisfactory completion of social activities \nundertaken for a RP and/or TDP. \n \n23.  The second path applies to all subprojects already sanctioned by the IIFCL board at the \ntime of the functioning of the ESMU (within 90 days of its establishment). For such subprojects, \nthe process would be as follows. \n \n(i)  Categorize  the  effects  of  the  subprojects  as  to  whether  they  warrant  the \nequivalent of a full or short RP/a full or short TDP.  \n(ii)  Check for social compliance based on the above categorization(s).  \n(iii)  Identify gaps, if any, in social compliance. If there are no gaps, then review all \nrelevant RP/TDP reports. For full Resettlement and/or TDPs, include field visit of \nsocial safeguards specialist. \n(iv)  If case of gaps in social compliance, direct subborrowers with time-bound actions \nto attain compliance. Hold disbursements until compliance is achieved.   \n(v)  Monitor and review whether the agreed gap measures are satisfactorily met. If \ncase of consistent default, cancel further disbursements.    \n(vi)  For compliant subprojects, if review of plan(s) shows adequate and appropriate \nreflection  in  the  subproject  costs,  then  update  legal  documents  to  reflect \napplicability of IIFCL\u2019s commitment to the RP/TDP as binding during the period of \nengagement. Take appropriate approval of the board.  \n(vii)  If review of the RP/TDP shows inadequacies in project costs, update PIM and \nredo financial appraisal to reflect strengthened/improved social safeguard plans. \nRe-assess commercial viability of the subproject. Obtain board approval for the \nrevisions.  Update  legal  documents  that  reflect  applicability  of  IIFCL\u2019s  social \nsafeguard plans as binding during the period of engagement. \n(viii)  Revise RP/TDP on completion of detailed subproject design, as necessary. \n(ix)  Implement RP/TDP. \n(x)  Monitor RP/TDP. \n(xi)  Link subproject closure to satisfactory completion of social activities undertaken \nfor an RP/TDP. \n ", "Appendix 10  77\n \nb.  Social Safeguards Screening \n \n24.  When a subborrower submits a subproject for financing to the lead bank for financing \nand if the IIFCL is a contributor to that financing, IIFCL will review the feasibility study reports \nwhich include social and environmental safeguard studies. The IIFCL will, in consultation with \nthe subborrower, decide whether any activities of the prospective subproject may cause IR/have \nsignificant impacts on tribal peoples. A checklist for assessing potential IR impacts forms Table \nA10.1, while Table A10.2 includes a similar checklist for effects on tribal peoples. In the event \nthat such screening by IIFCL indicates that either IR or tribal peoples effects appear likely, IIFCL \nwill  require,  from  the  subborrower,  adequate  safeguard  planning  instruments  such  as  an \nRP/tribal people development plan prepared in accordance with this SSF.  \n \n25.  IIFCL, based on reports received from the subborrower, will assess the magnitude of IR \nimpacts and determine whether a short or full RP is required for the subproject. A full RP will be \nrequired where resettlement is \u201dsignificant.\u201d1  \n \n26.  Similarly, as regards impacts on tribal peoples, a determination will be made as to the \nmagnitude of the significance of impacts and whether a short or full TDP is required.2  \n \nc.  PIM guidelines for the preparation of Social Safeguards Planning \nDocuments \n \ni.  Procedure  for  Prospective  Investments  with  IR/Significant \nEffects on Tribal Peoples \n \n27.  The subproject sponsor, in consultation with the ESMU, will prepare an RP/TDP as \ndescribed below and include such plans as part of the PIM to be submitted to IIFCL for review. \n \nii.  Plan Principles \n \n28.  The subborrower will prepare an RP according to agreed principles for IR including \n \n(i)  Draft National Policy on Resettlement and Rehabilitation, 2006. \n(ii)  The Land Acquisition Act of 1894 and as amended. \n(iii)  Relevant state laws and regulations. \n(iv)  IR policies of development partners. \n \n29.  The  subborrower  will  prepare  a  TDP  plan  according  to  agreed  principles  for  tribal \npeoples development including  \n \n(i)  The Government\u2019s forestry, minerals, and mines legislations and regulations. \n(ii)  The Government\u2019s common property rights and legislation. \n(iii)  Relevant state laws and regulations. \n(iv)  Draft  \u201cNational  Tribal  Policy:  A  Policy  for  the  Scheduled  Tribes  of  India,\u201d \nproposed by the Government\u2019s Ministry of Tribal Affairs in 2006. \n                                                 \n1  IR is \u201csignificant\u201d when 200 or more people will experience major impacts which are defined as being physically \ndisplaced from housing or losing 10% or more of their productive assets (income generating). \n2  The impacts of subprojects on tribal peoples will be considered significant if they positively or negatively (i) affect \ntheir customary rights of use and access to land and natural resources; (ii) change their socioeconomic status; (iii) \naffect their cultural and communal integrity; (iv) affect their health, education, livelihood, and social security status; \nor (v) alter or undermine the recognition of indigenous knowledge. \n ", "78  Appendix 10 \n \n(v)  IP policies of the development partners. \n \n30.  Given  varying  standards  in  applicable  policies  (central  and  state  governments \ndevelopment partners), the strictest provisions will be applicable to mitigate subproject impacts. \n \niii.  Resettlement Plans \n \n31.  The subborrower will prepare either a short or a full RP, depending on the magnitude \nand complexity of resettlement as determined by the social safeguards screening process.  \n \n32.  In the formulation of an RP for a subproject, the following issues should be addressed.  \n \n(i)  The subproject should explore alternatives to avoid IR and if avoidance is not \nfeasible, to minimize land acquisition and IR.  \n(ii)  The policy application should not be too restrictive. Significance of resettlement \nimpacts will guide planning.  \n(iii)  The plan should include all subproject-affected people irrespective of whether \nthey are property owners or not. \n(iv)  The cut-off date for eligibility should be the date of first notification for land \nacquisition. \n(v)  Compensation for loss of assets must be at replacement value.  \n(vi)  A comprehensive entitlement matrix is formulated to describe entitlements of \neach category of affected persons.  \n(vii)  Full compensation must be paid prior to taking over the land and other assets. \n(viii)  The  plan  must  clearly focus  on  income/livelihoods  improvement  in  the  post-\nresettlement period. \n(ix)  Information should be disseminated in a timely fashion, consultations held with all \naffected persons, and plan versions and monitoring reports disclosed at regular \nintervals in local languages. \n(x)  Independent monitoring system should be incorporated in the plan.   \n(xi)  Impact assessment must be clearly focused. \n(xii)  Detailed timetable for RP implementation. \n(xiii)  Detailed  budget  and  sources  of  budget  for  compensation,  relocation,  and \nrehabilitation of affected persons. \n \n33.  Key elements of an RP include (i) loan or investment description, with the likely scope, \nextent,  and  magnitude  of  the  resettlement  effects;  (ii)  screening  procedures  for  pipeline \ninvestments or components; (iii) resettlement policy principles and eligibility criteria that are \nconsistent with the policy and cover all investments, subprojects, and components under the \nloan; (iv) resettlement entitlements; (v) resettlement design criteria; and (vi) administrative, \nresourcing, and financing arrangements for preparation, approval, implementation, monitoring, \nand evaluation of full or short RPs.  \n \niv.  Tribal Development Plans \n \n34.  The subborrower will prepare either a short or a full TDP depending on the magnitude \nand complexity of project impacts as determined by the social safeguards screening process.  \n \n35.  An acceptable TDP addresses the (i) aspirations, needs, and preferred options of the \naffected tribal peoples; (ii) local social organizations, cultural beliefs, ancestral territory, and \nresource use patterns among the affected tribal peoples; (iii) process of free, prior, and informed ", "Appendix 10  79\n \nconsultations; (iv) potential positive and negative impacts on tribal peoples; (v) measures to \navoid, mitigate, or compensate for the adverse project effects; (vi) measures to ensure project \nbenefits will accrue to tribal peoples; (vii) an action plan of measures to ensure that tribal people \nreceive  social  and  economic  benefits  that  are  culturally  appropriate;  (viii)  accessibility  of \nprocedures for grievance redress; (ix) benchmarks for evaluating the outcomes of the TDP; (x) \nmeasures to strengthen social, legal and technical capabilities of government institutions to \naddress tribal peoples issues; (xi) possibility of involving local organizations and NGOs with \nexpertise in tribal peoples issues; and (xii) budget allocation and monitoring issues. \n \nv.  Complaints and Grievance Procedures \n \n36.  Both the RP and the TDP will separately outline procedures to handle grievances. \nGrievance  redress  mechanisms  for  affected  people  will  be  established  with  adequate \nrepresentation of affected people and genders. The grievances will be redressed at the local \nlevel in a consultative manner and with full participation of the affected households, or their \nrepresentatives, along with project officials and local government representatives. In case the \ngrievances are resolved within 15 days of their filing, the complainants will forward the same to \nIIFCL. In case the grievances still remain unresolved within 20 days of their filing, or the \ndecision  of  the  subborrower  is  not  acceptable  to  the  household,  the  aggrieved  party  may \nforward their complaints to a court of law. All costs incurred in resolving the complaints will be \nborne by the subborrower. IIFCL will document all complaints received. \n \nvi.  Consultation and Disclosure \n \n37.  Subborrowers  will  conduct  consultations  with  stakeholders  during  subproject \ndevelopment  and  implementation.  The  objectives  of  such  consultations  are  to  (i)  engage \nstakeholders in selection of RP and/or TDP priorities and program design (i.e., goals, objectives, \nactivities,  etc.),  and  (ii)  provide  stakeholders  with  opportunities  to  assess  the  subproject. \nSubproject  consultations  on  program  design  and  implementation  involving  stakeholders \nincluding  government,  NGOs,  civil  society  organizations,  and  affected  communities.  These \nconsultations occur on a formal and informal basis and may involve (i) pre-design consultations \nto  ensure  that  the  program  reflects  priorities,  needs,  experiences,  and  lessons  learned  of \nstakeholders; and (ii) consultations with target groups/beneficiaries as part of program design \nand implementation. \n \n38.  Wherever  an  RP  is  required,  affected  people  will  be  consulted  on \ncompensation/resettlement options, including relocation sites, and socioeconomic rehabilitation. \nPertinent resettlement information will be disclosed to the affected people at key points in their \nown  language(s),  and  specific  opportunities  provided  for  them  to  participate  in  choosing \nplanning and implementation options. The disclosure will be in a manner accessible to the \naffected people where there are differing levels of literacy. Grievance redressal mechanisms for \naffected people will be established with adequate representation of affected people and with an \nadequate  multi-gender  presence.  The  RP  will  be  made  available  to  them  prior  to  its \nimplementation in their own language(s) with details on their entitlements. \n \n39.  Whenever a TDP is required, tribal peoples will be consulted during the preparation of \nthe plan. They will be informed of subproject details, subproject benefits, possible adverse \nimpacts, and the mitigation measures proposed. Their views will be taken into account in \nfinalizing the plan. The TDP will be translated into the tribal language and made available to the \naffected people before implementation. The disclosure will be in a manner accessible to the \n ", "80  Appendix 10 \n \naffected people where there are differing levels of literacy. Tribal institutions and organizations \nin the affected area will also be involved in implementing the TDP and resolving disputes. \n \n40.  Both drafts, RP and TDP, will be made publicly available upon submission to the IIFCL \nas part of the PIM as will the final versions of the plans prior to their implementation. Plans may \nbe revised after submission as part of the PIM in response to (i) requests for revision during the \nappraisal process, and/or (ii) significant changes in the subproject during implementation. Such \nrevised plans will also be made available both to the plan-affected people and to the public. \n \nvii.  Plan Budgets and Financing \n \n41.  The Facility is committed to safeguarding the social effects of the various subprojects \nupon the lives and livelihoods of affected peoples. Adequate provision for financing both the RP \nand the TDP from the subproject annual budget will be made. The budget will include costs of \ncompensation, relocation and rehabilitation, social preparation, benefits-sharing, and livelihood \nprograms, as well as costs for planning, management, supervision, monitoring, and evaluation, \nland taxes, land fees, and physical and price contingencies. Similarly, resettlement plans should \nalso reflect the timeframe for resettlement planning and implementation. \n \nviii.  RP/TDP Appraisal Guidelines  \n \n42.  The IIFCL (or its agent) will appraise the RP/TDP submitted by the subborrowers as part \nof the PIM against the requirements for plans. \n \nix.  Conditionality and Covenants \n \n43.  Loan  disbursal  shall  be  contingent  on  satisfactory  compliance  with  the  obligations \nincurred through adoption of an RP and/or TDP. These arrangements for loan covenants will be \nreflected in the board note approving subprojects. To be covenanted also are the remedial \nprocedures to be followed to bring the plan(s) into compliance if monitoring discloses that RP or \nTDP are not in compliance with the safeguards in the SSF. \n \nx.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n44.  Monitoring and evaluation requirements will be defined as part of each RP/TDP. In \naddition, each subborrower will engage an external independent monitoring agent to undertake \nexternal  monitoring  of  the  plan(s).  Annual  external  monitoring  reports  will  be  submitted  to \ndevelopment partners. A key function of the external monitoring would be to ascertain whether \nany  unanticipated  impacts  on  tribal  peoples  or  unanticipated  resettlement  effects  become \napparent during project implementation. In such cases, the external monitor would assist the \nsubborrower to assess the significance of the impacts and identify measures to mitigate any \nadverse impacts and ensure that benefits accrue to the tribal peoples. IIFCL\u2019s ESMU would be \ninformed of and review such measures and their implementation. The external monitor would \nalso certify compliance with the requirements of the RP/TDP. \n \nxi.  Reporting \n \n45.  ESMU will prepare an annual report to participating development partners summarizing \n \n(i)  Progress  reports  based  on  each  subborrower\u2019s  operations  which  have  IR \nimpacts and/or impacts on tribal people.

Environment and Social Safeguards Management Unit \n \n46.  The ESMU will be trained in (i) screening prospective subprojects for IR and tribal \neffects, (ii) plan preparation and appraisal, (iii) plan monitoring, and (iii) reporting. The ESMU \ninitially will have consultants to assist it in reviewing project proposals. It may also contract with \nan  external  agency  to  carry  out  the  social  safeguard  assessment,  guidance,  appraisal, \nmonitoring, and reporting functions for which IIFCL will be responsible.  \n \nTable A10.1: Resettlement Screening Checklist \n        Indication of scope \n        (no. of affected people, \n  Not      land area, land use, \nImpact  Known  Yes  No  structures, etc.) \nIs the PSC undertaking or likely to undertake any         \nland acquisition? \nIs the PSC acquiring land through willing buyer to         \nwilling seller transactions?  \nDoes the PSC have any agreements or is it likely         \nto enter into agreements with the government for \nprovision of sites or land or rights to land? \nIs any of the land used by the PSC (or likely to be         \nused by the PSC) compulsorily acquired?  \nWill any PSC activities involve restrictions of use         \non adjoining land? \nAre the sites for land acquisition known?         \nWhat is the ownership status of the land?         \nAre non-titled persons present?         \nWill tenants, lessees, share farmers, or other third         \nparty users be affected? \nWill there be loss of housing?         \nWill there be loss of crops, trees, and other fixed         \nassets? \nWill there be loss of incomes and livelihoods?         \nWill access to facilities, services, or resources be         \nlost? \nWill there be loss of businesses or enterprises?         \nWill any social or economic activities be affected         \nby land use related changes? \nIf involuntary resettlement impacts are expected: \nAre  local  laws  and  regulations  compatible  with         \nADB\u2019s involuntary resettlement policy? \nWill land be acquired through the government or         \nby the PSC? \nDo PSC agreements with the government (if any)         \nspecify involuntary resettlement will be conducted \nin accordance with international standards? \nDoes  the  government  executing  agency/PSC         \nhave sufficient skilled resources for resettlement \n ", "82  Appendix 10 \n \n        Indication of scope \n        (no. of affected people, \n  Not      land area, land use, \nImpact  Known  Yes  No  structures, etc.) \nplanning and implementation? \nAre training and capacity building required prior to         \nresettlement planning and implementation? \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PSC = prospective subproject company. \n \nTable A10.2: Tribal Peoples Effects Screening Checklist \n  Not  Yes  No  Remarks or identified \nImpact on tribal peoples   Known  problems, if any \nAre  there  tribal  groups  present  in  project         \nlocations? \nDo  they  maintain  distinctive  customs  or         \neconomic  activities  that  may  make  them \nvulnerable to hardship? \nWill the subproject restrict their economic         \nand  social  activity  and  make  them \nparticularly  vulnerable  in  the  context  of \nproject? \nWill  the  subproject  change  their         \nsocioeconomic and cultural integrity?a \nWill the subproject disrupt their community         \nlife? \nWill  the  subproject  positively  affect  their         \nhealth,  education,  livelihood,  or  social \nsecurity status? \nWill  the  subproject  negatively  affect  their         \nhealth,  education,  livelihood,  or  social \nsecurity status? \nWill the subproject alter or undermine the         \nrecognition  of  their  knowledge,  preclude \ncustomary  behaviors,  or  undermine \ncustomary institutions? \nIn  case  there  is  no  disruption  of  tribal         \ncommunity life as a whole, will there be loss         \nof housing, loss of land, crops, trees, and \nother fixed assets owned or controlled by \nindividual tribal households? \na That is, undermine their production systems and the maintenance and transmission of their cultural patterns. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 11  83\nSUMMARY OF POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY  \n \nA.

No  partnership agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in India: Development of infrastructure \ncontributes  to  economic  growth,  which  in  turn  contributes  to  infrastructure  development  through \nincreased  demand  for  infrastructure  services.  Moreover,  investments  in  human  capital  and  in \ninfrastructure interact, thus increasing the returns to each investment. Investment in infrastructure \nservices can contribute to sustainable growth by (i) reducing transaction costs and facilitating trade \nflows within and across borders; (ii) enabling economic agents\u2014individuals, firms, and governments\u2014\nto respond to new types of demand in different geographies; (iii) lowering inputs costs in the production \nof almost all goods and services; (iv) opening new opportunities for entrepreneurs or making existing \nbusinesses more profitable; and (v) creating employment in public works. \n \nIn this regard, the World Bank business climate survey ranks the following as key constraints to doing \nbusiness in India: (i) power breakdown, (ii) voltage fluctuation, (iii) telecommunications failure, (iv) poor \nquality of roads, (v) inadequate land and industrial space, (vi) erratic water supply and waste disposal, \nand (vii) limited availability of freight services. There is also direct evidence regarding the importance of \nadequate infrastructure services in providing an enabling environment for business. For example, small \nbusinesses could expand after additional telephone lines are installed, requiring additional manpower \nand fixed assets. \n \nThe absence of local infrastructure is most critically felt by the poor who are acutely effective by \ninadequate infrastructure on their livelihoods. Shocks to the national economy such as the rationing of \nelectricity, are particularly evident to large numbers of people dependent on employment in small \nenterprises in the informal sector. While indirect benefits are harder for poor people to perceive, it is \nclear that the development and maintenance of national infrastructure is essential if India is to secure \nthe potential gains from globalization. Improving availability at the local level alone is unlikely to \ntransform the economy and developmental benefits will not be fully realized unless simultaneous \nimprovements at the local and the national level are introduced and managed.  \n \nThe proposed intervention seeks to expand the availability of funding sources to the India Infrastructure \nFinance Company Limited (IIFCL) and simultaneously improve IIFCL\u2019s capacity in accessing market \nsources of finance. The availability of additional resources will significantly assist IIFCL in fulfilling its \nmandate of expanding the availability of high quality infrastructure in India. Finally, the proposed \nassistance will also result in subprojects being priced on competitive terms, thereby reducing financing \nrisk and rationalizing pricing of services to the end borrower. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nA poverty and social analysis will be required to identify the socioeconomic profile of the population in \nthe subproject areas, expected benefits and constraints, and ability of the poor and vulnerable groups \nto benefit from the subproject. The analysis will have to identify ways to incorporate the needs of the \npoor and minimize and/or compensate for adverse impacts on them. This will be done through a review \nof existing studies on poverty and social analysis, focus group discussions and information gathering \ninterviews with primary and secondary stakeholders, and an additional socioeconomic survey of the \nsubproject area, if required. In order to assess whether benefits are reaching the most vulnerable \ngroups, attention will be required to profile the beneficiaries with gender-disaggregated demographic, \neconomic \n ", "84  Appendix 11 \nand social analysis. The same would be supported by further analysis on the incidence of poverty, \nidentification of vulnerable groups, ability and willingness-to-pay of targeted beneficiaries for cost \nrecovery, and any adverse impacts anticipated from the subproject. \n \nThe key anticipated impact on poverty will be through greater affordability of high quality infrastructure. \nWith more efficient and lower cost infrastructure, analysis would be necessary to establish if this \ntranslates into greater affordability and higher usage. This in turn, is expected to lead to greater \nincidence of compliance with tariffs and reduction in leakages.   \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                 No \n \nFor subprojects that will be funded by IIFCL, compliance requirements will necessarily include conduct \nof stakeholder consultations on both environmental and social safeguards issues. The consultations \nwill  assist  the  subproject  developer  in  establishing  an  environmental  impact  assessment  or  the \nsubproject information memorandum. Based on these, an environmental action plan, a resettlement \nplan, and a tribal development plan will be prepared with mitigations, wherever necessary. \n  \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women:  \n \nWomen will benefit from the subproject through improved access to various infrastructure services and \nmore affordable pricing of the same. This is also true for women entrepreneurs who have suffered due \nto the lack of high quality infrastructure, such as regular power supply for production units, and roads \nfor market access requiring the need to walk through difficult terrain. Further, regular water supply and \nadequate  drainage  improves  working  conditions  for  women  employees.  Moreover,  high  quality \ninfrastructure will assist women and other vulnerable groups through better quality health care and \neducation.  Finally,  women  will  benefit  from  subprojects  that  conform  to  required  environmental \nstandards.      \n \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \n \nE.
