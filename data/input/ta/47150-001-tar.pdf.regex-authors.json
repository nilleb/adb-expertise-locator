The proposed technical assistance (TA) is highly relevant to further expand tax revenue \nadministration  capacity  against  the  backdrop  of  a  weak  fiscal  situation  in the Maldives.  A \nconsultation  mission  to  assess  the  feasibility  of  supporting  the  Maldives  Inland  Revenue \nAuthority (MIRA) was fielded in December 2012. A fact-finding mission was fielded on 18\u201321 \nFebruary 2013. On 28 February 2013 the Government of the Maldives formally requested the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to provide a TA. The Office of the Vice-President cleared the \nTA on 9 May 2013 as it was not part of the country operations business plan. The government \nconcurred with  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation  arrangements,  cost  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Maldives\u2019 fiscal situation is under severe stress and an effective fiscal consolidation \nprogram remains paramount to the government\u2019s goal of enhancing service delivery\u2014including \noutreach\u2014while strengthening macroeconomic and financial stability. The fiscal deficit as a \npercentage of gross domestic product (GDP) was 12.6% in 2012, one of the highest among the \ndeveloping member countries of the ADB. The widening fiscal deficit is caused by two principal \nfactors:  (i)  increased  government  expenditures  including  added  pressure  to  deliver  public \nservices, especially in view of the challenges posed by the country\u2019s archipelagic nature and its \nexposure to climate change risks; and (ii) the limited revenue collection capacity of the country\u2019s \nnascent tax administration. On the expenditure side, a proposed World Bank TA will address the \nrationalization of government expenditure. On the revenue side, this TA will build on ADB\u2019s \nearlier  support  toward  establishing  the  MIRA.  As  recently  as  2008,  with  ADB\u2019s  Economic \nRecovery Program (ERP),2 the government introduced comprehensive tax reforms leading to \nthe roll-out of a modern taxation system. Despite important achievements, the full roll-out is not \ncomplete  and  further  work  is  required  to  diversify  tax  policy  and  further  strengthen  tax \nadministration capacity. In line with the proposed assistance, the International Monetary Fund \nhas  acknowledged  that  addressing  the  fiscal  deficit  is  the  most  pressing  macroeconomic \npriority,  and  emphasized  the  need  to  implement  tax  policy  reforms  and  strengthen  tax \nadministration capacity.  \n \n3.  The government continues to make good progress in implementing a wide range of tax \npolicy reforms. Under the Maldives Tax Administration Act, a new tax administration body, the \nMIRA,  was  established  in  March  2010.  In  addition  to  the  ERP,  ADB  has  supported  the \nestablishment of the MIRA through two TA projects.3 With respect to tax policies, the goods and \nservices tax (general and tourism) and the business profit tax were introduced in 2011 and are \ncurrently being implemented. ADB assistance supported the introduction and implementation of \nthese taxes, which have already led to significant improvements in tax collection.4 The TA under \nthe ERP specifically provided consultancy support for the implementation of the business profit \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 10 May 2013.  \n2 ADB. 2009.

The  MIRA  requires  further  support  to  strengthen  its  voluntary  compliance  and \nenforcement capacity with regard to taxpayer submissions.  \n \n4.  The proposed TA aims at strengthening the revenue collection capacity of the MIRA. \nMore  specifically,  the  MIRA  is  expected  to  increase  revenue  collection  through  (i)  the \nintroduction of information and communication technology (ICT) initiatives to increase voluntary \ntax  compliance,  (ii)  strengthening  its  tax  audit  system  to  enforce  tax  compliance,  and  (iii) \neffective implementation of current tax policy and legislation as well as through pursuit and \nimplementation of further tax policy reforms. \n \n5.  Taxpayer services play an important role in enhancing voluntary taxpayer compliance. \nFor an archipelagic country such as the Maldives, difficulty in providing services to taxpayers is \none of the key challenges, and it is therefore necessary to use technology in reaching out to   \ntaxpayers. The TA will assist the MIRA in strengthening taxpayer services functions through the \ndevelopment and implementation of a customer relationship management system (CRMS).  \n \n6.  Although the audit section of the MIRA has been conducting audit activities, its human \nresource capacity is not sufficient to carry out a comprehensive risk-based audit program. \nADB\u2019s preliminary review has found the tax amount collected as a result of audit actions \ncorresponded  to  only  0.3%  of  the  total  tax  revenue  in  2010,  whereas  a  majority  of  the \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries raised more than \n2.0% of their total tax revenue from audit activities. It is proposed that support is given to \nintroducing the concept of risk-based audits to increase the effectiveness of the MIRA\u2019s audit \nprogram in the long run. The TA will support the MIRA in strengthening its tax audit capacity. \n \n7.  There is much scope to enhance the implementation of and revenue collection from \nexisting tax legislation and policy. In addition, the Personal Income Tax Bill and the Corporate \nProfit Tax Bill are expected to be approved in the near future. It is necessary to draft and \nimplement subordinate legislation, internal procedures, and organizational arrangements for \nthese new laws. The TA will assist the MIRA in the effective implementation of existing tax \nlegislation and policies and at the same time prepare the MIRA for the implementation of new \ntax legislation and policies.  \n \n8.  The  government\u2019s  Strategic  Action  Plan,  2009\u20132013  recognizes  tax  policy  and \nadministration reforms as key issues for economic development, and the Government of the \nMaldives has committed to a wide range of tax policy and administration reforms. The latest \nADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the Maldives describe the development challenge of the \nMaldives as \u201ca narrow economic base with an inelastic taxation system\u201d and, as a result, \n                                                 \n5  Total tax revenues increased from $298 million in 2011 to $467 million in 2012. Revenues from the goods and \nservices tax increased from $60 million in 2011 to $168 million in 2012. Revenues from the business profit tax \nincreased from $25,000 in 2011 to $76 million in 2012.  \n6  ADB. 2013. Project Completion Report: Economic Recovery Program in the Maldives.

Overall,  increasing  the  MIRA\u2019s  tax  administration  capacity  will  increase  revenue \ncollection and support the rebalancing of the national budget, which is essential in addressing \nthe country\u2019s development agenda for poverty reduction. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be an improved fiscal position. Indicators and performance targets are as \nfollows: (i) tax revenue to GDP ratio increases to 21.0% by 2018 (2012 baseline: 19.7%), and \n(ii) the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio improves to \u20139.0% by 2018 (2012 baseline: \u201312.6%). \n \n11.  The outcome will be enhanced capacity of the MIRA in tax administration. Performance \ntargets and indicators are as follows: (i) tax compliance increases by 15% by 2015, (ii) revenue \ncollection increases by 10% by 2015, and (iii) the number of taxpayers subject to tax audit \nincreases by 20% by 2015. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will have the following outputs: (i) taxpayer services of the MIRA enhanced, (ii) \nthe audit capacity of the MIRA strengthened, and (iii) the readiness of the MIRA to effectively \nimplement tax policy reforms strengthened. Under output 1, the TA will finance the purchase of \nthe CRMS software license, software customization through a consulting firm, and hardware \nrequirements. The system will effectively interface the Revenue Administration Management \nInformation System with the CRMS. As a result, the CRMS will make it easier for taxpayers to \npay taxes and will raise voluntary tax compliance. Under output 2, substantive training and \noperational support will be provided for the MIRA\u2019s tax audit unit, including introduction of the \nconcept of risk-based audits. Under output 3, the TA will finance consulting inputs to support the \nreadiness of the MIRA to introduce and implement new tax initiatives.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million, of which $850,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide  support  in  the  form  of  counterpart  staff,  office  accommodation,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.   The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  executing  agency  and  the  MIRA  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. The MIRA has demonstrated strong ownership and commitment in past \nTA projects with ADB.9 The MIRA leadership (the commissioner general) is well known for its \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2007.

A  consulting  firm  (international,  15  person-months)  will  be  recruited  to  provide  one \nfunctional lead and four ICT specialists to develop the CRMS. Procurement will be by quality- \nand cost-based selection (quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10 since greater priority for quality is needed) \nand the selection will be evaluated on the basis of simplified technical proposals. In addition, a \ntax administration (tax audit) specialist (6 person-months) and a tax policy specialist (6 person-\nmonths) will be recruited as individual consultants. The two individual consultants (preferably \nformer tax authority officials with hands-on experience) will have very specialized skills and as a \nresult will not be able to be recruited through the consulting firm. All consultants will be recruited \naccording to the ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  Disbursement  will  be  made  according  to  lump-sum  milestones  payments.  Servers, \nnetwork accessories, and the required software license to support the development of the \nCRMS amount to $240,000 and will be procured through three shopping lots. Procurement will \nbe carried out in accordance with ADB Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to \ntime).  All  disbursements  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nHandbook (2010, as amended from time to time).   \n \n16.  Supported by the consultant team, the MIRA will organize conferences with stakeholders, \nincluding officials from the Japanese National Tax Agency, to share and disseminate findings. \nThe outputs of the TA will be widely disseminated online as well as through publications.  \n \nIV.
