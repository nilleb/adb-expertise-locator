INTRODUCTION \n1.  At the second and third Ministerial Conferences on Central Asia Regional Economic \nCooperation (CAREC) held in November 2003 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan; and in November 2004 \nin Astana, Kazakhstan, respectively, the ministers of the seven CAREC countries\u2014Azerbaijan, \nthe People's Republic of China (PRC), Mongolia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, \nand Uzbekistan\u2014reiterated their strong commitment to regional economic cooperation as a \nmeans to realizing a shared vision of a region where people live in harmony and prosperity, with \nfree movement of goods, people, and ideas. The ministers also acknowledged a multitude of \nproblems and challenges that require even greater cooperation if CAREC countries are to \nsuccessfully integrate with world markets and achieve sustained economic growth and poverty \nreduction.  In  this  context,  the  ministers  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to \ncontinue to support the CAREC program by strengthening the role of the overall institutional \nframework  (OIF),1  identifying  feasible  regional  projects,  continuing  to  mobilize  or  provide \nfinancial resources, and further enhancing donor coordination and cooperation with neighboring \ncountries. The regional technical assistance (TA) is included in the CAREC Member Countries \nRegional Cooperation Strategy and Program 2005\u20132007 (RCSP). The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  ADB's CAREC program began modestly in 1997 with poverty reduction as its goal. The \nCAREC program has strategically focused on improving infrastructure and policy environments \nin  the  priority  areas  of  transport,  trade  facilitation,  and  energy  to  (i)  lessen  the  region's \ngeographic disadvantages, (ii) promote trade and transit within and beyond the region, and (iii) \nenhance the efficient and sustainable use of vital natural resources such as energy and water. \nThe program has followed a practical and results-oriented operational approach, achieving \ntangible progress toward longer-term strategic objectives. This strategic focus and operational \napproach has been strongly supported by CAREC countries as reflected in the joint statements \nof the ministerial conferences in 2003 and 2004. \n \n3.  Much has been accomplished under the CAREC program. Five investment and program \nprojects in priority sectors totaling $224.1 million are being implemented with cofinancing of \n$135.2 million from other donors. A substantial amount of grant assistance in priority areas \namounting to $14.8 million has been provided for policy support, analytical studies, and capacity \nbuilding. The OIF, established in 2002 to guide the CAREC program, has proven effective in \nplanning, coordinating, and implementing the regional cooperation projects and activities. In \nMay  2003,  several  multilateral  institutions\u2014the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and \nDevelopment (EBRD), the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Islamic Development Bank \n(IsDB), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Bank\u2014joined the \nframework to closely coordinate their support for regional cooperation under the aegis of the \nCAREC with ADB serving as the secretariat. These steps highlight the fact that the CAREC \nprogram has developed into a fully-fledged regional cooperation mechanism with ownership on \nthe part of member countries and effective coordination among development partners. \n \n                                                \n1  The overall institutional framework consists of an annual ministerial conference, senior officials meetings, sector \ncommittees, and project-specific working groups. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 30 July 2004. \n ", "2     \n4.  The progress made under the CAREC program is partly attributable to neutral and open \nexchange of ideas it creates through its meetings, forums, and working groups for CAREC \ncountries and multilateral institutions. These meetings have built trust and mutual respect. \nLessons  learned  from  ADB's  experience  in  supporting  regional  cooperation  include  the \nfollowing: (i) strong and sustained political will continues to be important because regional \ncooperation  is  a  long-term  process;  (ii)  consensus  among  member  countries  should  be  a \nworking  principle  in  promoting  the  regional  cooperation  agenda;  (iii)  strong  support  from \nstakeholders  on  regional  cooperation  is  important;  and  (v)  continued  support  for  capacity \nbuilding at the national and regional levels remains critical for successful regional cooperation.                         \n \n5.  At the ministerial conferences in November 2003 and in November 2004, ministers \nnoted with satisfaction the progress made to date under the CAREC program and at the same \ntime, recognized formidable challenges to advancing regional cooperation. These challenges \ninclude (i) reducing economic distance for restoring the region\u2019s historical role as a land bridge; \n(ii)  increasing  trade  and  integration  with  large  markets,  both  globally  and  in  the  region\u2019s \nproximity; (iii) improving supplies of energy and other resources; and (iv) in the longer term, \ntackling potentially negative externalities such as environmental degradation and the spread of \ncommunicable diseases. The ministers therefore agreed to continue progress made under the \nCAREC program by (i) strengthening the OIF; (ii) further supporting key regional projects; (iii) \nclosely coordinating and cooperating with development partners, other regional initiatives, and \nprivate sectors; and (iv) exploring cooperation prospects with neighboring countries beyond \ncurrent members. The CAREC member countries have requested ADB to continue to provide \nnecessary support. \n \n6.  Keeping in mind the lessons learned from previous experiences for regional cooperation \nand CAREC ministers' request for support, ADB as the catalyst for the CAREC program should \nbe in a position to deliver timely, carefully targeted support for the program. At the same time, \nthe support should be also clearly aligned with the strategic thrusts of the RCSP. First, to \ndeepen political will and trust as a foundation for cooperation, and to enhance strategic and \nimplementation  aspects  of  the  CAREC  program,  OIF  components  such  as  the  ministerial \nconferences, senior officers\u2019 meetings, sector committees, and national focal points will have to \nbe  substantially  strengthened.  Given  the  ever-increasing  need  for  institutional  support  for \nimportant  regional  issues,  this  should  be  addressed  as  a  matter  of  priority.  Furthermore, \nstrategic cooperation with important regional organizations such as Central Asia Cooperation \nOrganization (CACO) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) needs to be explored \nand synergies exploited. \n \n7.  Second,  CAREC  needs  to  focus  more  on  identifying,  preparing,  and  implementing \nfeasible regional projects in priority sectors that would show tangible benefits and serve as \nchampions and catalysts for further cooperation. In doing so, it will be useful to expand projects \nto include larger neighbors, thus ensuring better access to larger markets and more secure \nsupplies of natural resources. Because scarce financial resources have emerged as a binding \nconstraint to building and maintaining infrastructure, consultations with multilateral and bilateral \ndevelopment partners\u2014as well as with private sectors, both internal and external\u2014to mobilize \nfinancing for regional projects should be further strengthened.            \n \n8.  Third,  the  CAREC  program  should  endeavor  to  build  a  conducive  environment  for \nregional cooperation in general, and for the program in particular. The relative lack of such an \nenvironment explains in part why regional cooperation has not reached its potential despite \ncommitment from leaders and indigenous efforts by governments. Efforts are ongoing in this ", "      3 \nregard, and they include capacity building for regional cooperation3 and information exchange \nthrough the CAREC web site. The cooperative environment needs to further strengthened by (i) \nbuilding  constituencies  among  the  business  community,  the  academic  community,  and \nnongovernment organizations (NGOs) to support regional cooperation by providing diverse \nperspectives and peer pressures; (ii) further information-sharing and dissemination on positive \noutcomes  of  regional  projects  and  events;  and  (iii)  in-depth  analytical  studies  on  regional \ncooperation that quantify specific costs and benefits and provide regional poverty data. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The purpose of the TA is to strengthen the CAREC program in line with the strategic \nthrusts of the RCSP for CAREC countries. The main outputs and outcomes envisaged from the \nTA are (i) forums for continued dialogue among member countries and multilateral institutions \nunder the CAREC mechanism; (ii) sector road maps and new regional projects, particularly in \npriority areas of transport, energy, trade facilitation and trade policy; (iii) analytical studies on \nregional cooperation; (iv) strong and effective constituencies for regional cooperation; and (v) \nexpanded networks for information exchange and dissemination.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  As an umbrella TA for the CAREC program, the TA will support activities to be guided by \nthe ministerial conferences under the OIF. Close consultation will be conducted with the senior \nofficials\u2019  meetings,  national  focal  points,  sector  coordinating  committees,  and  multilateral \ninstitutions coordination group throughout TA implementation. Specifically, the TA will support \nthe activities described below. \n \n11.  Enhancing an Environment for Dialogue for Regional Cooperation. Building on the \nlessons learned from previous TAs, the TA will continue to create and support an environment \nfor open and frank dialogue on regional cooperation issues as a means to building mutual trust \nand understanding. The TA will prepare the CAREC ministerial conferences, senior officials\u2019 \nmeetings,  meetings  of  sector  coordinating  committees4  and  working  groups,  and  other \npreparatory meetings under the OIF. These meetings will be more closely linked to the strategic \nthrusts identified in the joint ministerial statements and RCSP in close consultation with the \nrespective national focal points and line ministries. The TA will also support close coordination \nwith other development partners and regional organizations to ensure complementarities and \nsynergy in support of regional cooperation. \n \n12.  Identifying Windows of Opportunity for Regional Cooperation. The TA will support \nefforts to prepare and implement sector road maps and new regional projects, particularly in the \npriority sectors of transport, energy, trade facilitation, and trade policy. Regional projects that \nengage larger neighbors will be explored in close collaboration with the ongoing TA5 to yield \nenhanced results. Possible projects include transport corridors that connect Russia and the \nPRC to warm-water ports in the Arabian Sea through the CARs, and hydrocarbon energy \npipelines from the CARs to neighboring energy-deficit countries. Given the continuing financing \n                                                \n3 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Capacity Building for Regional Cooperation in Central Asia. Manila (TA 6158 \nfor $950,000 approved on 18 December 2003). \n4  The TA will complement another TA to support activities under the Customs Cooperation Committee.   \n5 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for Subregional Economic Cooperation in South and Central Asia. Manila (TA \n6156 for $600,000 approved on 18 December 2003).   \n ", "4     \ngaps, resource mobilization will be further intensified for regional projects that have needs and \nprospects for cofinancing from other development partners. \n \n13.  Undertaking Analytical Studies. Quality economic sector work is essential in seizing \nopportunities  for  regional  cooperation.  Analysis  would  reduce  uncertainty  about  costs  and \nbenefits, thus enhancing the willingness of the countries to cooperate. In this context, the TA \nsupports the following analytical work: (i) a study on the strategic direction of the CAREC \nprogram  in  a  changing  environment,  focusing  on  coordination  and  cooperation  with  other \nregional initiatives such as CACO, SCO, and Central and South Asia Transport and Trade \nForum; (ii) a regional database on income and nonincome poverty indicators as a foundation for \ncollaborative regional efforts of poverty reduction; and (iii) further economic and sector work in \npriority  areas  in  coordination  with  ongoing  studies  on  trade,  transport,  and  transit,6  as \nappropriate. \n \n14.  Building Strong Constituencies for Regional Cooperation. As a first step toward \nbuilding strong constituencies for regional cooperation, the TA will support organizing a regional \nbusiness roundtable, as requested by member countries.7 Private sectors will play a larger role \nin driving regional cooperation, domestically and regionally, and thus the roundtable will provide \na  valuable  opportunity  to  shape  the  regional  cooperation  agenda  and  offer  a  feedback \nmechanism for determining its effectiveness and impact. Given the relatively low degree of \nprivate-sector development in the region, the roundtable will be organized on a pilot basis in \nconjunction with other events such as the CAREC ministerial conferences and/or senior officials\u2019 \nmeetings.  Close  coordination  and  cooperation  with  existing  initiatives  in  this  area,  with \ninstitutions that have expertise, and with ADB's South Asia Department will be necessary to \nensure the success of the event. The possibility of holding forums on regional cooperation for \nacademics and/or NGOs will be also explored as appropriate. \n \n15.  Furthering Information Dissemination. This component aims to generate a greater \nawareness to the CAREC program and regional activities and to facilitate information exchange \nand dissemination among stakeholders. In close cooperation with ADB\u2019s Office of External \nRelations,  the  TA  will  significantly  improve  current  CAREC  web  site  in  terms  of  its  style, \ncontents, coverage, and translation into Russian. The TA will also facilitate the preparation and \nwide circulation of the quarterly regional newsletter. New methods of disseminating information \nabout the CAREC program, such as publications and articles, will be also explored. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million equivalent. ADB will finance $900,000 equivalent \non a grant basis by ADB's TA funding program. The participating governments will provide \nremaining $100,000, equal to the imputed value of staff time and use of government facilities \nconducting activities under the TA. Detailed cost estimates are given in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements     \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA. ADB\u2019s CAREC unit will be responsible for \noverall  guidance  and  implementation  of  TA  activities.  The  national  focal  points  under  the \nCAREC mechanism will continue to coordinate regional activities in each member country \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance for Central Asia Regional Cooperation in Trade, Transport, and Trade. Manila \n(TA 6184 for $350,000 approved on 20 August 2004).  \n7  At the senior officials\u2019 meeting held on 15\u201316 April 2004 in Almaty, Kazakhstan, the member countries requested \nthat ADB explore the possibility of having a CAREC business forum.  ", "      5 \nthroughout the TA. TA activities will be closely coordinated with those of other multilateral \ninstitutions and regional organizations that are concerned with regional cooperation, as well as \nwith ADB resident missions in the region, to ensure effective implementation. \n  \n18.  TA implementation will require 7 person-months of international consulting services and \n76 person-months of domestic consulting. A core group of consultants will provide advisory, \ntechnical,  and  administrative  support  services  to  assist  in  the  overall  management  of  the \nCAREC  program.  In  addition  to  the  core  group  of  consultants,  consultants  for  regional \ncooperation,  private-sector  development,  and  media  and  publication  affairs  shall  also  be \nengaged. All consultants will be selected as individuals in accordance with the Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. An outline of the terms of \nreference for consultants is in Appendix 4. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 18 months, from 1 January 2005 to 30 June \n2006. Conference and meeting proceedings, as well as studies and reports, will be published \nand posted on the updated CAREC web site and quarterly regional newsletters as appropriate. \n \nIV.
