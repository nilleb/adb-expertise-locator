The water policy1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), approved in January 2001, \npromotes national water sector reforms, integrated water resources management (IWRM), and \nimproved water services for the poor. In addition, the policy commits ADB to regional and \nsubregional cooperation by helping to assess the water sector and exchange data, enhancing \nawareness and understanding of water sector issues and each country\u2019s needs, and supporting \nwater partnerships in ADB\u2019s developing member countries.  \n \n2.  To  stimulate  the  adoption  of  a  more  strategic  and  sustainable  approach  to  water \nresources, the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development called for all countries to \ndevelop IWRM and water efficiency plans by the end of 2005. During the summit, a number of \ngovernments and funding institutions committed to various financial assistance initiatives to \nencourage  the  institutionalization  of  key  changes  that  would  promote  more  strategic  and \ncoordinated decision-making processes in relation to the development, management, and use \nof water resources to advance sustainability goals and meet development challenges. These \ncommitments included that of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands to make an initial \ncontribution to ADB, through a separate technical assistance (TA) arrangement, for the purpose \nof supporting the process of developing IWRM plans in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and \nViet Nam. \n \n3.  For this purpose, the governments of the participating countries (the governments) have \nrequested ADB to prepare a TA that will promote effective and efficient preparation of IWRM \nplans and programs in their respective countries. The TA was prepared in consultation with \nvarious stakeholders. ADB missions and follow-up consultations were conducted from October \n2004 to February 2006 to formulate the TA and reach an understanding with the governments \non  the  goal,  purpose,  activities  and  inputs,  outcomes  and  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, costs and financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.2 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n  \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4. Many countries in the Asia and Pacific region are experiencing water-related problems \nthat are proving intractable to conventional, single-sector approaches. Problems of drought, \nflooding, groundwater overdraft,3 waterborne diseases, land and water degradation, ongoing \ndamage  to  ecosystems,  and  escalating  conflicts  over  water  have  proven  hard  to  address \nbecause solutions often fall outside the normal purview of the agencies tasked with addressing \nsuch problems and require cooperation by agencies in multiple sectors. \n \n5.  The geographical location of Bangladesh, for example, in an alluvial, deltaic floodplain \ncreated by the confluence of three major rivers (the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna) \ncauses massive challenges in terms of flooding during the monsoon season; water scarcity \nduring the dry season; erosion; saline intrusion and environmental degradation, particularly in \nthe southwest; cyclones; and heavy arsenic contamination of groundwater. Water management \nis further complicated by the country\u2019s dense population and expanding economic activities, with \nsevere implications for its rich and vulnerable ecosystems. Bangladesh has recently set up an \neffective policy, planning, and institutional framework for comprehensive management of its \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Water for All: The Water Policy of the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 22 October 2005. \n3  Overdraft refers to more rapid and intensive groundwater extraction relative to its ability to renew itself.  \n ", "2   \nwater resources that includes the 1999 national water policy and the 2004 national watershed \nmanagement  plan  (NWMP).  However,  NMWP  objectives  are  yet  to  be  fully  achieved  as \nimplementation takes a slow pace.  \n \n6.  In Indonesia, continued deforestation causes landslides, river sedimentation, increased \nflooding, and losses of livelihoods and lives. Urban and industrial wastewater remains untreated \nand  unregulated,4  resulting  in  waterways  that  are  hazardous  to  people\u2019s  health.  Urban \npressures, combined with environmental degradation, are also increasingly causing conflicts \nover water. The 2004 Water Law includes provisions for a process of IWRM and detailed \nguidelines have been developed; however, actions taken to date to operationalize IWRM have \nbeen insufficient. In addition, technical and administrative capacities continue to be poorly \nmanaged because of the failure to decentralize functions and allocate responsibilities between \nnational and local agencies.  \n \n7.  In Pakistan, more than two thirds of surface water resources have been fully developed. \nGroundwater development has little room for expansion and poor management of groundwater \nresources  has  led  to  an  overdraft  situation  in  many  areas,  with  salinity  and  waterlogging \nadversely  affecting  agricultural  production.  At  current  consumption  rates,  the  burgeoning \npopulation and the accompanying sharp rise in urban demand will outstrip available supply in \nthe next three decades. The resource base of surface water and groundwater is also becoming \nincreasingly degraded, rendering it unfit for further exploitation in many areas. In addition, the \nsupply of surface water is also vulnerable because of the high variability of flows in the Indus \nRiver. Pakistan is at a crossroads in the management and development of its water resources \nand will face a crisis if it does not take concrete actions to address current problems. The \nfederal and provincial governments share the management of water resources, while provincial \nor local authorities are responsible for most delivery of water services. The IWRM framework is \nweak at all levels, as is capacity and support for improved IWRM is needed, especially at the \nprovincial level. \n \n8.  Viet Nam is pursuing the preparation of action plans for IWRM through its national water \nresources  strategy  and  a  wide  range  of  activities  to  address  specific  aspects  of  water \nmanagement. Despite the overall strategy and plan for IWRM, a number of issues require \nimmediate attention to improve water management at the local level, for example, management \nof the quality of surface water, subsurface water, and groundwater.  \n \n9.  Even  though  all  four  participating  countries  have  promulgated  decrees  covering \nwastewater  discharges  in  an  attempt  to  manage  surface  water,  issues  relating  to  existing \npolicies,  processes,  and  technical  matters  still  need  to be  resolved  to  make water  quality \nmanagement workable and to introduce regulatory frameworks at the provincial and local levels. \nIn particular, robust and effective measures to help rural communities improve water quality or \nmitigate  the  effects  of  poor  quality  water  are  needed.  In  relation  to  the  management  of \nsubsurface water and groundwater, major concerns have been raised by national and local \nwater agencies in relation to the rapid deterioration of groundwater resources: both water quality \nand quantity issues are threatening supplies of water to many communities and industries, with \nevidence suggesting that current levels of extraction are unsustainable in many areas. \n \n                                                 \n4  The discharge of industrial wastewater is unregulated and, thus, industries have no motivation to apply treatment \nprior to discharge. \n ", "  3\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA will help the governments develop and implement IWRM strategies so that they \ncan  achieve  their  World  Summit  for  Sustainable  Development  commitments.  The  TA  will \nstrengthen the policy, regulatory, and institutional framework for improved IWRM planning and \nimplementation at the national and local levels. The impacts are expected to include clearer \ndefinition and delineation of functions among national and local agencies and strengthened \ncapacities of water management and regulatory agencies. In addition, an adequate and reliable \ndatabase  for  each  country  will  be  established  to  help  with  the  coordination  of  plans  and \nimplementation  of  programs  across  sectors  with  respect  to  water  supply  and  demand \nmanagement. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA comprises four major project activities. Their methodologies and key activities \nare described below and specific details for each country are shown in Appendix 2.  \n \n12.  Resource  Assessment  and  Indicator  Development.  Existing  patterns  of  water \nmanagement and consumption will be identified. Seasonal variations in both quality and quantity \nof  surface,  subsurface,  and  groundwater  resources  will  be  examined  and  evaluated.  The \ncomponent will identify gaps in past and current IWRM programs and use the lessons learned \nas a guide for undertaking future initiatives. In Indonesia, river basin organizations will be \nclassified in accordance with water management needs, for which performance indicators will \nbe developed. The activities in Pakistan will include (i) collecting data by means of water sample \ncollections  from  major  and/or  critical  water  sources  and  their  analysis;  (ii)  establishing  a \ndatabase; (iii) developing criteria for evaluating the condition of water resources; (iv) developing \nguidance  notes  and  manuals  on  water  resource  assessment  and  the  use  of  monitoring \nindicators; and (v) conducting workshops and training for water management personnel in \nnational,  provincial,  and  local  agencies  on  water  resource  assessment  and  the  use  of \nmonitoring indicators. In Viet Nam, the TA will identify groundwater sources in the Red River \ndelta area and make an initial assessment of water availability from each source as a basis for \nfuture aquifer management. \n \n13.  Impact Evaluation and Identification of Mitigation Measures. With the resources \nassessed and the indicators established, the TA will evaluate the impacts on human health, \nresource  sustainability,  and  ecosystem  integrity  and  estimate  the  economic  costs  of  such \nimpacts. Activities will include (i) conducting extensive research on the possible impacts of \nunsustainable  water  consumption  practices  on  human  health  and  the  environment,  (ii) \nestimating the economic costs of the adverse impacts of such unsustainable practices, and (iii) \nundertaking consultations and training workshops on the identification of mitigation measures \nand the development of action plans. In Bangladesh, activities will include a review of past and \ncurrent  water  management  programs  in  relation  to  promoting  poverty  reduction  and  the \ndevelopment of water-poverty indicators. In addition, the TA will help Indonesia and Viet Nam \ndesign and set up water regulatory and reporting systems to support regulatory councils at the \nnational  and  local  levels  in  devising  appropriate  discharge  permits  and  fees  as  mitigation \nmeasures. \n \n14.  Capacity Building for IWRM Formulation and Implementation at National and Local \nLevels. To assure the effectiveness and implementation of IWRM systems in the four countries, \n ", "4   \na thorough review of such systems will be conducted and gaps relating to policy, regulatory, and \ninstitutional capacities to support implementation at the national and local levels will be identified. \nRecommendations for how to address these gaps will be provided. Activities will include (i) \nassessing current IWRM systems; (ii) consulting with provincial and/or local water management \nagencies to identify implementation gaps; (iii) preparing comprehensive recommendations on \nhow to address these gaps; and (iv) holding consultations with and workshops for national, \nprovincial, and local water management personnel to promote consensus on the adoption of \nappropriate recommendations. In Bangladesh, national and local capacities will be enhanced to \nmotivate political commitment to formulate and implement an IWRM and efficiency plan.5 In \nIndonesia, the roles of water councils will be reviewed and strengthened to link with effective \nIWRM implementation. In Pakistan, the TA will improve IWRM planning and implementation in \nthe province of Punjab. In Viet Nam, new capacities will be introduced and existing capacities \nwill be updated so that the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment and provincial staff \nwill be able to implement IWRM processes.  \n \n15.  Consultation and Dissemination of Lessons Learned.  A consultative approach will \nbe taken in all four countries. Consultations with stakeholders will be conducted throughout TA \nimplementation to promote greater understanding of the TA, stimulate public participation, and \nforge  partnerships  among  various  sectors.  The  outputs  and  outcomes  of  the  TA  will  be \npresented  at  public  seminars  and  workshops.  A  network  will  also  be  developed  for  the \nexchange  of  information  and  experiences  among  the  countries,  and  study  visits  will  be \nconducted if necessary. To enhance the replicability of the activities in the four countries in other \ndeveloping  member  countries,  lessons  learned  will  be  documented  and  conferences  and \nworkshops  will  be  conducted  for  the  various  stakeholders,  including  representatives  of \ngovernment agencies and the private sector, at which the lessons learned can be shared, \ncommitment  to  action  can  be  solicited,  plans  of  action  regarding  IWRM  development  and \nimplementation can be adopted, and ADB\u2019s water sector portfolio can be enhanced. The TA will \nalso provide for participation by the four countries in such regional activities as the Network of \nAsian River Basin Organizations and the Global Water Partnership. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total project costs are estimated at $1,145,000 equivalent, of which the Government \nof the Netherlands will provide $1,000,000 on a grant basis to be administered by ADB for \nactivities within the scope of the TA. The governments will provide counterpart contributions \ntotaling $145,000, mainly in kind in the form of counterpart staff, office space and supplies, \nadministrative support, services, and logistics. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan \nare presented in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, which will be carried out over 24 months \nfrom November 2006 to October 2008. The Energy, Transport, and Water Division of the \nRegional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  will  be  responsible  for  the  overall \ncoordination of the TA activities. The Water Committee and sector divisions in Central and West \nAsia Department, South Asia Department, and Southeast Asia Department will supervise TA \nimplementation in the four countries. \n                                                 \n5  An IWRM and efficiency plan describes how countries will change their water management in the context of how \nthey envisage IWRM and articulates the steps that the countries intend to take to achieve full\u2013scale, sustainable \nwater resources development and management. The IWRM and efficiency plan will be reviewed and revised in an \niterative and consultative way as implementation proceeds. \n ", "  5\n18.  For Bangladesh, the Water Resources Planning Organization of the Ministry of Water \nResources  will  be  the  implementing  agency  responsible  for  overall  TA  management  and \ncoordination. The TA will support a policy advisory group consisting of renowned local water \nsector specialists that will guide the TA and other relevant sector activities. For Indonesia, the \nDirectorate General of Water Resources and the Agency for Research and Development, both \npart of the Ministry of Public Works, will be the implementing agencies. For Pakistan, the \nMinistry of Water Resources will be the implementing agency, together with the Provincial \nPlanning Commission of Punjab, and will work closely with the Punjab Irrigation and Power \nDepartment, which is generally responsible for IWRM at the provincial level. For Viet Nam, the \nMinistry of Natural Resources and Environment, along with the provincial people\u2019s committees \nin the two target provinces, will be the implementing agency and will coordinate inputs from the \nministries of Agriculture and Development, Health, Planning and Investment, and others. The \nimplementing agencies in each country will organize interministerial meetings to guide the TA \nprocess. Individual activities will be implemented by the designated line agencies by mobilizing \nexisting  working  groups  or  task  forces.  Participation  in  the  organization  of  seminars  and \nworkshops will also be sought from local nongovernment organizations, other experts and \nstakeholders, and external funding agencies to seek their feedback on the TA\u2019s outputs. \n \n19.  ADB will engage a national consultant as TA administrator to work at ADB headquarters \nfor  approximately  10  months  on  an  intermittent  basis  to  monitor  and  coordinate  TA \nimplementation in the four countries. ADB will also contract for a total of 108 person-months of \nconsulting  services  (90  person-months  national  and  18  person-months  international)  to \nimplement the TA components in the four countries. The international and national consultants \nwill be specialists in water resources assessment, IWRM, management information systems, \ndata management, monitoring system, environmental and natural resources economics, and \ntraining. All consultants (both individuals and firms) will be engaged by ADB, in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. For the selection of consulting firms, the quality- \nand cost-based selection method will be used and firms will be required to submit biodata \ntechnical proposals. However, where appropriate, simplified technical proposals will be required.  \nThe consultants will work closely with the TA administrator. The outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 4. \n \n20.  The team of consultants in each country will submit (i) an inception report at the end of \nthe 1st month following its mobilization; (ii) brief monthly progress reports; (iii) an interim report \nat the end of the 6th month; (iv) a draft final report at the end of the 11th month; and (v) a final \nreport within 3 weeks of the final tripartite meeting between ADB, the implementing agencies, \nand the consultants that incorporates comments by ADB and the implementing agencies. The \nimplementing  agencies  will  submit  hard  and  electronic  copies  of  the  final  report  to  ADB. \nMeetings between ADB and the implementing agencies will be held following submission of the \ninception, interim, and draft final reports. The TA\u2019s outputs will be posted on ADB\u2019s web site. \n \n21.  Any procurement of equipment, such as that related to water sampling and analysis and \ndata processing, will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to be financed on \na grant basis by the Government of the Netherlands for Process Development for Preparing and \nImplementing Integrated Water Resources Management Plans, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nClearly defined,  IWRM strategies and  Policy dialogue with the  \u2022  Political will and \ndelineated, and  approaches are  governments represented  commitment of pertinent \ncoordinated IWRM  developed and  by pertinent national and  agencies to take action in \nfunctions and initiatives  implemented by the  local agencies  relation to pressing water \nsupported by enhanced  governments    supply and demand \nand updated capacities  Studies and reports  management issues \nin the governments of  \u2022  Coordinated efforts to \nBangladesh, Indonesia,  obtain efficient and \nPakistan, and Viet Nam  effective TA \n  implementation for \nimproving the knowledge \nbase \n\u2022  Favorable economic \nconditions in each of the \nfour countries \n\u2022  Presence of fiscal and \nnonfiscal incentives to \nadopt water supply and \ndemand management \nstrategies and policies \n \nRisk \n\u2022 Uncoordinated efforts may \nresult to disagreements \namong national and local \nagencies resulting to \ndelays and poor \nimplementation. \nOutcome      Assumptions \nStrengthened IWRM  Procedures, database,  Policy dialogue at the  \u2022  Information gaps among \nplanning and  tools, and M&E  national and local levels;   the agencies concerned \nimplementation  systems are developed  consultations with and  and across the water \ncapacities at the  and integrated into the  workshops for targeted  sector vary, posing a \nnational and local levels  concerned national and  stakeholders  challenge for developing \nin Bangladesh,  local water sector    guidelines and strategies \nIndonesia, Pakistan,  agencies\u2019 operational  Training programs for the  \u2022  National and local \nand Viet Nam  plans in each of the  targeted national and local  decision makers \n  four countries  water sector agencies  participate actively once \n    guidelines and regulatory \nRelevant national and  Studies and reports  systems have been \nlocal staff are trained in  developed \nIWRM planning and   \nprogramming  Risk \n  \u2022 Nonavailability of required \nWater regulatory and  expertise in the respective \nreporting systems  country. \npertaining to the \npromotion of water \nresources sustainability \nmeasures are adopted \n ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

The goal of the technical assistance (TA) is to improve water resources management \nand service delivery to move toward the goals of the national water policy (NWP) and the \nnational  watershed  management  plan  (NWMP),  that  is,  to  optimize  benefits  in  terms  of \nlivelihoods, production, and the environment. The expected outcome is improvements in the \nenabling  environment,  the  performance  of  the  relevant  institutions,  and  the  planning  and \nprogramming of investment achieved through participatory implementation of specific actions for \nintegrated water resources management (IWRM) and better service delivery in line with the \nGovernment\u2019s commitments at the World Summit for Sustainable Development (WSSD). The \nTA  will  also  raise  stakeholder  awareness,  Government  commitments,  and  momentum  for \naccelerated reforms. To institutionalize the reform process, the TA will use the Government\u2019s \nexisting institutional setup and will provide supplementary services and inputs to support the \nactivities of the designated organizations. Its activities will be coordinated and harmonized with \nprograms by other external financing agencies, in particular, the twinning missions with the \nBangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB) and Water Resources Planning Organization \n(WARPO) fielded by the Government of the Netherlands. A consultative approach will be taken \nto enhance stakeholder awareness while generating stronger ownership.  \n \n2.  The specific TA outputs and activities include the following:  \n \n(i)  IWRM implementation plan. An implementation plan will be prepared for IWRM \nduring the TA period. For this purpose, the TA will undertake a participatory fact-\nfinding exercise to (a) review the country\u2019s water sector reforms in light of the \nIWRM  and  efficiency  plan  agendas  of  the  WSSD,  and  (b)  identify  specific \nopportunities and the scope of actions for furthering the agendas during the TA \nimplementation period. The plan will be finalized through intensive stakeholder \nconsultations and will encompass policy and legal frameworks, institutions for \nIWRM and water service delivery, and priority programs and actions as specified \nunder the national water policy and the NWMP.  \n \n(ii)  IWRM operationalization and improved service delivery. On the basis of the \nIWRM implementation plan, the TA will support specific actions identified, which \nwould include (a) reviewing implementation of the NWP and identifying specific \nactions for its improvement, (b) establishing monitorable water-poverty indicators \nintegrating NWMP and the Government's national poverty reduction strategy, (c) \noperationalizing the NWMP annual review process by means of an action plan to \naccelerate its implementation, (d) reviewing the performance of the BWDB and \ndevising an action plan for enhanced effectiveness, (e) advancing preparation of \nthe draft national water act, (f) finalizing and undertaking initial implementation of \nthe organizational development plan of the WARPO, and (g) preparing outputs \nfor any other relevant agendas. On the basis of these activities, the TA will also \nsupport the preparation of biannual reports for the National Water Council to \nreport on the TA\u2019s work plan and outputs and an IWRM road map laying out \nshort- to medium-term policy and institutional actions and priority investments. \n \n(iii)  Stakeholder  consultation  and  information  dissemination.  National \nstakeholder workshops will be held at TA inception and midway through the TA \ncompletion stage to seek stakeholders\u2019 feedback on the TA work plan and draft \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \noutputs. Lessons learned will be documented and workshops will be conducted \nwith the various stakeholders and representatives of government agencies and \nthe private sector to share those lessons. \n \nB.  Indonesia \n \n3.  The  2004  Water  Law  clearly  states  that  IWRM  should  be  carried  out,  key  IWRM \nstakeholders  should  be  identified,  and  a  framework  for  regulation  should  be  defined.  A \ncomprehensive IWRM planning and management process already exists, including detailed \nguidelines. Since decentralization in 1999, the operationalization of IWRM has been insufficient \nand concerns have arisen that capacity for effective countrywide implementation of IWRM is \ninsufficient. Any analysis of the characteristics of Indonesia\u2019s 80 river basins and the status of \nIWRM implementation therein would show a wide diversity of available natural resources, water \nresource utilization, and river basin organization (RBO) and stakeholder activities.  \n \n4.  The benchmarking of RBOs\u2019 performance was a priority activity in the 2004\u20132005 work \nprogram of the Network of Asian River Basin Organizations (NARBO). On 3 September 2005, \nthe NARBO Performance Benchmarking System was launched at the Second Southeast Asia \nWater Forum in Bali, Indonesia. Four of the 11 pilot RBOs are in Indonesia, demonstrating \nIndonesia\u2019s strong commitment to the NARBO initiative. However, the pilot RBOs are the most \ndeveloped institutions on largely-developed river basins and do not represent the diversity of the \ncountry\u2019s RBOs. \n \n5.   The TA will work closely with and build on the NARBO initiative and other ongoing IWRM \nactivities in Indonesia by (i) reviewing current IWRM practices throughout the archipelago; (ii) \nassessing needs-based, appropriate levels of IWRM based on simple basin characteristics; (iii) \ndesigning  appropriate  benchmarking  systems;  and  (iv)  benchmarking  river  basins  using \nsecondary data sources augmented by and verified with local governments and river basin \nstudies.  Links  will  be  established  between  IWRM  capacity-building  needs  and  IWRM \nperformance.  Workshops and intensive stakeholder dialogue will be undertaken. \n  \n6.  The long-term impact of the TA will be improved and sustainable IWRM. The outcome \nwill  determine  the  nature  and  extent  of  any  IWRM  capacity  gap  and  develop  a  targeted \nstrengthening approach based on the needs of key stakeholders.  \n \n7.  The specific TA outputs and the activities include the following:  \n \n(i)  Resource assessment and indicator development. RBOs will be classified in \nterms of (a) national characteristics (demographics, socioeconomic status, and \ngovernance structure); (b) basin characteristics (size, resources endowments, \nland use, demographics, and infrastructure); and (c) RBO characteristics (age, \nfunding, objectives, and membership). Activities will include (a) collecting primary \nand secondary data; (b) setting up a database and performance indicators; (c) \ndeveloping  criteria  for  characterizing  river  basins\u2019  IWRM  status  and  water \nmanagement  needs;  (d)  developing  guidance  notes  and  manuals  on  IWRM \nbenchmarking; and (e) facilitating workshops and training for national, provincial, \nand local IWRM stakeholders. \n \n(ii)  Impact  evaluation  and  identification  of  mitigation  measures.  Having \nassessed  water  resources  management  needs  and  established  performance \nindicators,  systems  will  be  designed  and  institutions  identified  for  routine \n ", "  Appendix 2  11 \nmanagement of performance benchmarking. Reporting formats will be designed \nfor simple time series reporting within a river basin and across RBOs with similar \ncharacteristics. These systems will provide summary information for regulatory \ncouncils at the basin, provincial, and national levels.  \n \n(iii)  Capacity building for IWRM formulation and implementation at the national \nand  local  levels. The institutional capacities of government organizations to \nsupport the implementation of IWRM benchmarking at the national and local \nlevels  will  be  identified.  The  roles  of  water  councils,  nongovernment \norganizations,  universities,  and  learned  bodies  will  also  be  reviewed  during \nmultistakeholder  workshops.  Benchmarking  indicators  to  monitor  capacity  for \nIWRM  will  include  stakeholder  involvement,  internal  RBO  management,  and \nservice provision performance and will be linked to IWRM outcomes. \n \n(iv)  Consultation and dissemination of lessons learned.  TA implementation will \nbe carried out following an inclusive, consultative approach involving government \nagencies,  donors,  community,  nongovernment  organizations,  and  community \nstakeholders.  Consultations  with  stakeholders  will  be  conducted  to  promote \ngreater  understanding  of  the  TA,  stimulate  public  participation,  and  forge \npartnerships across sector agencies. Lessons learned will be documented and \nmultistakeholder workshops will be conducted. \n \nC.  Pakistan \n \n8.  The TA will improve IWRM planning and implementation at the provincial level in Punjab. \nSpecifically, the TA will support (i) capacity building for IWRM in water resources management \nagencies, (ii) planning capability for IWRM in key water resources agencies, (iii) strengthening \nof IWRM and reform of water sector institutions and policies, (iv) technical and institutional \nanalyses to help develop and implement action plans for IWRM, and (v) consensus-building \nactivities in relation to IWRM agendas. \n \n9.  Together, the components should result in the implementation of activities that advance \nthe IWRM agenda of the Government of Pakistan and the provincial government of Punjab. \nDeliverables will include (i) planning frameworks, (ii) action plans, (iii) technical and institutional \nanalyses and other reports, (iv) a synthesis of the public consultation process that will feed into \nrefinement of the planning frameworks and action plans, and (v) a summary report on the \nprocess and the outcomes that presents lessons and helps institutionalize the action planning \nprocess. \n \n10.  Specific TA activities will include the following: \n \n(i)  Capacity building for IWRM review and enhancement at the federal and \nprovincial levels. The primary focus of the TA is to work with the provincial \ngovernment of Punjab to develop and implement an IWRM action plan by means \nof dialogue with relevant government agencies and other stakeholders.

Provincial-level \nstakeholder workshops will be held to solicit feedback on the proposed water \nsector  reforms  and  action  plans.  Lessons  learned  will  be  documented  and \nconferences and workshops will be conducted with the various stakeholders and \nrepresentatives  of  government  agencies  and  the  private  sector  to  share  the \nlessons learned. \n \nD.  Viet Nam \n \n11.  The proposed TA will provide support for developing and implementing the national \nwater resources strategy in two critical areas of IWRM, namely, groundwater management and \nwastewater management. The proposed support will institutionalize IWRM in practical ways. \nSpecifically, the TA will develop procedures, tools, and implementation options for addressing \nsurface water and groundwater management problems that will be applicable at the local level, \nultimately  with  the  active  engagement  of  local  communities.  By  establishing  the  base \ninformation required to manage these resources, the TA will enable the Ministry of Natural \nResources and Environment (MoNRE) to assess and define actions to further enhance the \npolicy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  framework  needed  to  support  local-level  approaches  to \nIWRM that focus on poverty reduction. \n \n12.  Specific activities will include the following: \n \n(i)  Resource assessment and indicator. Viet Nam will face daunting challenges \nrelated to water resources in the future and must establish a firm foundation for \neffective management of these resources. This TA will help MoNRE (a) identify \nand apply techniques and indicators for assessing the quality and quantity of \nsurface,  subground,  and  groundwater  resources  in  selected  locations;  (b) \nevaluate the extent of aquifer and groundwater resources for the major Red River \nbasin aquifers, identifying major areas of extraction; (c) establish systems and \nprocedures for the use of water quality indicators developed by the Ministry of \nHealth in relation to major effluent discharges from selected industries; (d) design \na monitoring network for water quality (bacteriological and toxin contamination) \nbased on the indicators developed for selected industry discharge locations that \nshould  include  estimates  of  the  capital  and  recurrent  costs  of  operating  the \nnetwork together with proposals for funding the operations; and (e) facilitate \nworkshops and training for national, provincial, and local water management \npersonnel on water resource assessment and use of monitoring indicators. \n \n(ii)  Impact evaluation and identification of mitigation measures. Poor quality \nsurface water and groundwater have disproportionate impacts on the poor. The \nnegative impacts of low-quality water on incomes, health, and the environment \nare increasingly being recognized. The TA will help MoNRE establish working \narrangements  with  polluting  industries  and  undertake  appropriate  discharge \nmanagement  and  effluent  treatment  to  mitigate  and  reverse  impacts  on  the \nenvironment, the river system, and the communities in the vicinity of selected \n ", "  Appendix 2  13 \nindustries and representative sites in the Red River basin and elsewhere.
