INTRODUCTION \n1.  During the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country-programming mission in May 2002, the \nGovernment of the Republic of Azerbaijan and ADB reconfirmed the need for improving the health, \nnutrition, and psychosocial development of young children in the country. Project preparatory \ntechnical assistance (TA),1 for the Early Childhood Development (ECD) Project was included in the \n2003 country program. A Fact-Finding Mission visited Azerbaijan on 20-30 November 2002 and \nmet with key government officials, international organizations, and nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs); visited preschools and health care facilities; and agreed with the Government on the \nobjectives, scope, and implementation arrangements for the TA. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Despite high gross domestic product (GDP) growth (averaging more than 10% over the last \n3 years), Azerbaijan remains a low-income country with per capita GDP of $702 in 2001. Poverty \nincidence also remains high: almost 4 million people or 50% of the population live below the \npoverty line (about $25 equivalent per capita per month), according to the 2001 household budget \nsurvey. Poverty rates are similar across different regions. Since independence in 1991, public \nexpenditures  for  basic  social  services  have  declined.  Government  health  care  expenditures \nrepresented only 0.8% of GDP, and education expenditures, 3.5% of GDP in 2002, compared with \n2.6% and 6.9% in 1990, respectively. The reduced public social expenditures and economic \nconstraints of households have taken a particularly heavy toll on children. Children\u2019s malnutrition \nhas increased, fewer children are taken to health facilities when they are seriously ill, and fewer \nchildren attend preschool programs. According  to  the  2000  Multiple  Indicator  Cluster  Survey \n(MICS) supported by the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund (UNICEF), the net enrollment rate in \nprimary schools has declined to 86%, which is low for a part of the former Soviet Union (FSU).  \n \n3.  The Government has become increasingly aware of the poor state of social indicators and \nessential services affecting children in Azerbaijan. The National Poverty Reduction Strategy (2003-\n2005)2 clearly links income poverty to individual capabilities, maintaining that poor education, \nillness and malnutrition tend to lead to low income and to income poverty. Based on the framework \nof capability poverty and the household budget survey, which shows children are at the highest risk \nof  falling  into  poverty,  the  Strategy  prioritizes  investment  in  young  children,  including  early \nchildhood care and education, immunization, prevention and treatment of common childhood \nillness, safe motherhood and newborn care, and salt iodization to reduce iodine deficiency disorder \n(IDD).     \n \n4.  The Government's focus on ECD is well grounded. Development status in early childhood \nhas  long-lasting  effects  on  people\u2019s  subsequent  mental  and  physical  growth  and  health. \nMalnutrition in early childhood translates into limited cognitive and mental development. Lack of \nintellectual stimulation in early childhood inhibits full potential mental development. A combination \nof health and nutrition services and psychosocial stimulation has had a better impact on child \ndevelopment than interventions focusing on single field. Investment in ECD will increase human \ncapital by improving the efficiency of basic education, higher education attainment, and life-long \nearning potential. It will also cut public expenditures for education and health services by reducing \ngrade repetition and morbidity. Children in greatest need, such as those from poor families, tend to \nbenefit most from ECD interventions, as such programs compensate for the lack of human and \neconomic  resources  of  caretakers  at  home.  Thus,  investment  in  ECD,  especially  when \ncomprehensive, is effective in reducing future poverty, and also in narrowing inequality in the \nsociety by helping disadvantaged children catch up with better-off children.  \n                                                 \n1  TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 23 January 2003.  \n2  The Strategy was approved by Presidential Decree on 20 February 2003.  ", "2 \n \n5.  Early  Childhood  Education.  In  the  FSU,  health  care  networks  were  extensive,  and \npreschool institutions, either full-day nurseries (0-3 years of age) or kindergartens (3-6 years of \nage),  provided  children  with  a  package  of  necessary  services:  health  care,  nutrition,  and \ndevelopment  activities.  This  picture  has  changed  dramatically.  The  percentage  of  children \nattending kindergartens fell from 21% in 1990 to 11.5% in 2000 \u2013 from 29% to 17% in urban areas, \nand from 9% to 6% in rural areas.3 According to government data, there are 1,794 preschool \ninstitutions in total, which have the capacity to enroll about 20% of children in the corresponding \nage groups.4 However, even the existing limited capacity of preschools is underutilized, which \nseems to indicate a gap between parents\u2019 demand for and the supply of preschool programs in \nterms of accessibility, affordability, and quality.5 Diminishing access to preschool is an especially \nserious concern because no alternative opportunity for psychosocial stimulation for young children \nor means to prepare children for school has been put in place yet. Lack of school preparation is \nlikely to increase the risks of dropping out of school.  \n \n6.  The quality of preschools needs improvement. Most facilities have no heating, and some \nare unsafe, for example having exposed electric wires. Learning materials are in short supply. The \ncurriculum does not encourage children\u2019s creativity or individual development. Improvements of \nactivities may be best done through introducing fresh pedagogy, which has proven successful in \nother countries, and encouraging creativity of domestic specialists. The Ministry of Education \n(MOE) would like to diversify preschool programs and interventions in order to improve access to \nand quality of preschool programs. Suggested models include (i) community-based preschool \nprograms, (ii) kindergartens attached to primary schools, (iii) half-day preschools, and (iv) better \nparenting programs for educating parents on child-caring practices and involving them in preschool \nprograms.   \n \n7.  Health and Nutrition. The health care networks established prior to independence have \nbeen deteriorating.  According to the official statistics, the infant mortality rate (IMR) and under-5 \nmortality rate (U5MR) steadily declined in the last decade. However, IMR and U5MR based on the  \nMICS are substantially higher: estimated at 79 for IMR and 102 for U5MR.6 The official figures \nunderestimate reality, as many households do not report to public health facilities; also, the \ndefinition  of  live  births  in  the  FSU  differs  from  the  standard  definition  of  the  World  Health \nOrganization (WHO). Malnutrition is prevalent. In 2000, 20% of children were stunted. Stunting \nreached  26.5%  among  the  poorest  quintile,  while  it  was  13.2%  among  the  richest  quintile. \nMicronutrient deficiency is a serious concern, especially for children and women in Azerbaijan. The \nprevalence of iodine deficiency was 86% among high-risk raions (districts) according to a survey \nconducted  by  a  Greek  NGO  in  1999,  and  the  prevalence  of  iron deficiency anemia among \npregnant women was 52.5% in 2001 according to government data. These indicators suggest that \nchildren's cognitive loss and maternal deaths due to micronutrient deficiency are serious risks in \nthe country.   \n \n8.  The Ministry of Health (MOH) identified the five most urgent health/nutrition problems of \nchildren as: (i) acute respiratory infections; (ii) perinatal causes; (iii) diarrhea diseases; (iv) lack of \nimmunization; and (v) micronutrient deficiencies. The first three are the most significant causes of \nchild mortality in the country. While health education of the community and caregivers would \n                                                 \n3  There is no apparent difference in attendance by gender.  \n4  Including four private kindergartens in Baku that have opened recently.   \n5  Even some parents who could afford to pay some fees do not send children to kindergartens. For example, parents in \nBaku have limited choice of either very expensive private kindergartens, which charge more than $300 equivalent a \nmonth, or state kindergartens, which collect about $2 (except from internally displaced persons) but are often of poor \nquality, mainly due to lack of finance. Some middle class parents who are willing to pay $30-$50 equivalent a month \nfor better quality cannot find such options.   \n6  These are higher than poorer countries. For example, in Kyrgyz Republic with per capita income less than half of \nAzerbaijan's, IMR and U5MR were 62.3 and 72.3, respectively, according to the 1997 demographic and health survey.  ", "    3 \nsubstantially contribute to reduction of these problems, better availability of essential drugs and \nmore effective primary health care are also important. The Government is considering the adoption \nof the integrated management of childhood illnesses developed by WHO and UNICEF, which \nwould contribute to reduction of U5MR.  \n \n9.  Parents\u2019 Involvement. The majority of young children are cared for at home, which will \ncontinue in the short to medium term. Very limited data are available on childcare practices at \nhome. Judging from the economic constraints of families and from anecdotal evidence on changing \nhealth-seeking behavior, support for families and communities would be useful for improving ECD \npractices at home. The quality of public services would also improve through closer monitoring by \nfamilies and communities.  \n \n10.  Financing and Management.  Both preschool programs and primary health care are under \nfinanced. In 2001, 9% of the education budget was spent on preschool programs. Considering that \nthe private sector's involvement in preschool services is almost nil, this is very limited investment. \nGovernment expenditure on health care is only 0.8% of GDP. The lack of public funding is \ncompensated for by out-of-pocket expenditures of households to a large extent, and families have \nadjusted health care-seeking behavior. ECD-related public services are funded mostly by local \ngovernment budgets based on norms set by MOE and MOH. To improve ECD status, the budget \nallocation for health services needs to be increased, and investment in preschool programs needs \nto be increased through resource diversification. Effective utilization of limited resources may be \nimproved by shifting from norm-based to needs-based budgeting. The involvement of the private \nsector and civil society in the financing and management of different ECD services may be \nexplored.  \n \n11.  Existing Assistance by Donor Agencies.  UNICEF has been the most active agency in \nthe field of ECD. An ECD Core Group was constituted by the Government with UNICEF\u2019s support \nunder MOE. No other international agencies are currently active in ECD. An ADB-administered \ngrant project, Improving Nutrition of Poor Women and Children in Asian Countries in Transition, \nfinanced by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) is one of the biggest activities on \nmicronutrient deficiencies.   \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n12.  The goal of the TA is to prepare a project within the overall ECD strategic framework to \nimprove the development status of young children (0\u20138) with focus on promoting psychosocial \ndevelopment and mitigating micronutrient malnutrition and mortality due to common childhood \nillnesses. The specific objective of the TA is to assist the Government in (i) reviewing needs and \npolicies for ECD, (ii) developing strategies for improving ECD, and (iii) preparing a loan project \nsuitable for ADB financing. Expected outputs of the TA are (i) an ECD subsector assessment and \nanalysis, (ii) an ECD policy and strategic framework with estimated costs and time line, and  (iii) a \ndraft project suitable for ADB financing. The project framework is presented in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will be guided by three principles: (i) the life-cycle approach, (ii) targeting the poor, \nand (iii) community and family involvement. The life-cycle approach recognizes different needs of, \nand corresponding interventions for, children of different ages. Under this TA, the target population \nmay be divided into 0-1, 1-3 years, 3-6 years, and the first grade (7-8). The TA will identify the \nneeds of poor children, and the most appropriate and efficient mechanisms for targeting poor ", "4 \nchildren. It will regard the community and families as key stakeholders to be involved in problem \nidentification and search for the solutions.  \n \n14.  The TA will especially focus on early childhood care and education, child nutrition, and \ncommon childhood illnesses as the areas for core interventions, and those interventions have to \nconverge on poor children through an effective integration mechanism. The ensuing Project will be \nthe first integrated ECD Project of substantial scale in Azerbaijan. It will implement integrated \ninterventions in selected raions or towns, while it will maintain national-level activities including \ncapacity building, policy analysis and reform, and communication. A long list of candidate raions7 \nhas been prepared based on various social indicators and political commitment, and a final set of \nproject raions will be selected prior to TA inception.     \n \n15.  Specific activities to be included in TA are as follows: \n \n(i)  Baseline survey of core ECD indicators for the selected raions and needs \nassessment for defining problems. The TA will utilize existing secondary data \nand conduct limited surveys for missing indicators, including child care practices at \nhome, in the community, at preschools, and at certain health facilities; and selected \npsychosocial development indicators. Systematic discussions with stakeholders will \nbe conducted to identify their constraints and solicit their suggestions.  \n \n(ii)    Strategies and policy development. The TA will assist the Government in further \ndeveloping and operationalizing ECD strategies for the next 5 years. Based on a \nreview of existing policies, recommendations for policy improvements will be made. \nIn the process, resources for implementing the strategies will be identified and \ncosted,  financial  sustainability  of  the  strategies  will  be  analyzed,  and  a  viable \nfinancial plan will be recommended to the Government.  \n \n(iii)   Designing a project suitable for ADB financing. The TA will finance a feasibility \nstudy of a loan project within an overall strategic framework that will address the \nneeds  of  the  targeted  population.  Project  preparation  will  include  detailed \nformulation of project components, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, \npoverty and social impact assessments, and monitoring and evaluation frameworks. \nWhile positive experiences in Azerbaijan will be replicated under the Project, the TA \nwill identify innovative activities that have proven successful in other countries and \ncould be feasible in Azerbaijan.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $750,000 equivalent of which $460,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $290,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. ADB will finance \n$600,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $140,000 equivalent of \nthe local currency cost. The remaining local currency cost of $150,000 equivalent will be financed \nby the Government in kind. The TA will be financed by ADB on a grant basis from the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government has been advised that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any ensuing Project. The detailed cost \nestimates and proposed financing arrangements are in Appendix 2.  \n                                                 \n7  Agdjabadi, Agdash, Fuzuli, Gakh, Goaychay, Guba, Jalilabad, Khanlar, Khyzi, Imishli, Oguz, Tovuz, and a raion each \nfrom Baku and Nakhchivan.                                                                                                                                                                                                    ", "    5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The executing agency will be MOE, and MOE and MOH will be the implementing agencies \nfor relevant components.  MOE will monitor the progress and quality of the TA together with ADB, \nand will provide counterpart support such as staff to participate in the TA work, and office space for \nthe TA team. A steering committee will be formed prior to the inception of the TA comprising \nrepresentatives of the MOE, MOH, Ministry of Economy and Development, Ministry of Finance, the \nselected raion governments, and the state statistical committee; academics specializing in early \nchildhood education, child nutrition, and child health; the country project coordinator for ADB\u2019s \nJFPR project; UNICEF; and other members the Government considers necessary. MOE will \norganize steering committee meetings, and the steering committee will periodically advise MOE on \nall important matters and provide policy guidance. Three working groups on early childhood care \nand education, maternal child and nutrition, and financial and institutional support will also be \nconstituted,  comprising  technical  experts  and  representatives  of  participating  ministries.  The \ngovernor\u2019s office of each selected raion will be responsible for producing a raion-specific project \nplan with assistance from the TA. Raion governments will provide counterpart support for the TA in \nthe form of counterpart staff time, information, and office space as necessary.   \n \n18.  The duration of the TA will be 6 months, from about July 2003 to December 2003. ADB will \nengage an international consulting firm in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Quality-\nbased selection will be used due to the importance of the selected firm having appropriate \ntechnical background and experience. A full technical proposal will be required. The firm will \nprovide  18.5  person-months  of  international  consultants,  and  48  person-months  of  domestic \nconsultants  with  expertise  in  institutional  development  and  management,  early  childhood \neducation, maternal and child nutrition, maternal and child health, financial and economic analysis, \nand social analysis. The summary initial poverty and social analysis is shown in Appendix 3. Funds \nfor workshops and training may be advanced in accordance with ADB's advance payment facility.  \n \n19.  The firm will work closely with MOE, MOH, and other line ministries; raion governments, \nand the steering committee; and it will participate in the working groups. The firm will select \ndomestic consultants in the participating raions who will assist the raion governments and the \ninternational consultants in preparing a raion plan in consultation with communities and other \nstakeholders. Launching workshops will be organized at both at the national and raion levels to \nensure stakeholders\u2019 understanding of the TA objectives and to confirm their involvement in the \nTA.  The consultant team will organize regular monthly meetings with MOE and the steering \ncommittee. Outline terms of reference and a list of required reports are in Appendix 4. Equipment \nwill be procured by the consultants in accordance with the arrangements acceptable to ADB.   \n \n20.  UNICEF  has  expressed  interest  in  contributing  to  the  TA  by  conducting parallel and \ncomplementary  activities,  including  assisting  the  Government  in  developing  an  ECD  policy.                 \nDetails of UNICEF\u2019s activities will be developed and confirmed with the Government and the \nconsultants during inception.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to the \nGovernment of Azerbaijan for preparing the Early Childhood Development Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.

The Project will contribute to the reduction of poverty in Azerbaijan by (I) improving productivity of \npeople, (ii) reducing mortality of children (preventing human capital loss), and (iii) reducing education and health \nexpenditures through prevention of grade repetition and morbidity.    \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis        Proposed Classification: poverty intervention  \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \nAzerbaijan's poverty rate is 50% (the poverty line is $25 equivalent per person per month), with little regional \nvariation. Therefore, geographical targeting will lead to substantial leakage of resources to the nonpoor. Identifying \nfeasible and politically acceptable poverty targeting mechanisms is one of the key tasks of poverty analysis.  \nAnother important aspect of the poverty analysis will be needs assessments of the poor. Very limited data are \navailable on livelihoods, and on child care practices in poor communities.  \n \nC.

The technical assistance (TA) will be implemented by a team of international (18.5 \nperson-months) and domestic (48 person months) consultants. Each international consultant \nwill  have  a  domestic  counterpart.  The  consultant  team  will  also  appoint  local  project \ncoordinators for selected raions (districts), who will stay in the raions and work closely with the \ngovernor\u2019s office and communities. \n \nA.  Meetings and Workshops \n \n2.  The TA team will operate from an office in the Ministry of Education (MOE) and travel to \nraions as necessary. Project coordinators for selected raions will be from the raions and will \nwork with the raion governors, under the TA team\u2019s supervision.
