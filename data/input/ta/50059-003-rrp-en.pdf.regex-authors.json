THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nNepal  for  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Power  Transmission  and \nDistribution  System  Strengthening  Project.  The  report  also  describes  the  proposed                          \n(i) administration of a grant, and (ii) administration of technical assistance (TA), both to be \nprovided by the Government of Norway, for the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation \nPower Transmission and Distribution System Strengthening Project, and if the Board approves \nthe proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the \nadministration of the grant and the administration of the TA. \n \n2.  The proposed project will complete the reinforcement and modernization of the power \nsupply system in Kathmandu in Bagmati Province.1 This project will also begin strengthening \ndistribution systems outside of Kathmandu in a systematic and phased manner starting with the \nBharatpur metropolitan area of Chitwan district in Bagmati Province and Pokhara of Kaski district \nin Gandaki Province, where supply interruptions are frequent and prolonged. The project will also \nsupport Province 2, where the quality of electricity supply is poor and about 20% of households \nare still without access to the national grid. Further, the project will strengthen transmission lines \nfor evacuation of hydropower to the main load center in Kathmandu and other load centers, while \nexcess power is traded with neighboring countries. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Nepal is a landlocked, mountainous country located between the large and fast-growing \neconomies of the People\u2019s Republic of China to the north and India to the east, west, and south. \nNepal\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged 7.3% during fiscal year (FY) 2017\u2013\nFY2019. With deepening economic uncertainties due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic, compounded by social and health emergencies, the preliminary estimates from the \nCentral Bureau of Statistics in Nepal show that GDP growth will significantly decline to 2.3% in \nFY2020.2 The need to stimulate post-COVID-19 economic recovery by developing Nepal\u2019s \ninfrastructure has become more relevant.  \n \n4.  Sector challenges. Following years of facing chronic electricity shortages, especially \nduring dry winter months (October to March), Nepal made significant improvements in electricity \nsupply during FY2017 and FY2018. These improvements were achieved through a combination \nof  (i)  increased  electricity  imports from  India  of  about  400 megawatts  (MW);  (ii)  improved \ntransmission capacity and operational flexibility by commissioning new transmission facilities; and \n(iii) better load management involving major industrial customers. While there is currently no \nsignificant gap between electricity demand and supply, the power transmission and distribution \nsystems need further strengthening to increase network capacity and redundancy and eliminate \nbottlenecks between generation hubs and load centers. Also, although 78% of Nepal\u2019s population \nhas access to grid-supplied electricity, the distribution systems require immediate upgrading and \nexpansion to improve the reliability and quality of supply, and to facilitate expected future demand \ngrowth. The poor financial position of Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA), due to poor billing and \ncollection practices, and inadequate tariffs, impinge on its capacity to invest in distribution system \n \n1  Nepal is composed of seven provinces as defined by Schedule 4 of the Constitution of Nepal. Some of the provinces \nhave names in place while others are recognized by numbers. \n2  GDP estimates for FY2020 of the Central Bureau of Statistics, Government of Nepal, published on 29 April 2020. ", "2 \nexpansion, and address high technical and commercial losses arising from deteriorated and \nunder-capacity assets and electricity theft. These investment requirements over the next 10 years \nuntil 2030 are beyond the budgetary resources of the government. At the same time, the \ninvestment environment in the sector, including regulation, is not sufficiently mature to attract \nprivate sector capital and participation at the level required, particularly in the transmission and \ndistribution subsectors.  \n \n5.  Government  priorities  and  reform  initiatives.  The  government  recognizes  the \ncontinued need for physical investment in electricity supply infrastructure. Government issued the \nWhite Paper on Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation Sector\u2019s Current Status and Roadmap \nfor Future on 8 May 2018 outlining priorities and reform initiatives for 2018\u22122028 including \nhydropower  development,  and  modernizing  transmission  and  distribution  subsectors.  The \nGovernment of Nepal initiated plans to install an additional 15,000 MW of generation capacity by \n2028 to meet domestic demand, and to export surplus electricity to India and Bangladesh. In this \nregard, the government will support the construction of selected storage-type hydropower plants \nwhile encouraging the private sector to invest in run-of-river hydropower projects and other \nrenewable energy sources. As indicated in the White Paper, the focus of Nepal\u2019s power system \ninvestment program is now gearing toward delivering a reliable and high-quality supply of \nelectricity to domestic consumers through enhanced transmission and distribution systems, and \npositioning the country to become a net energy exporter. These investments are critical to satisfy \nthe country\u2019s power supply needs in the longer-term and to provide universal access to reliable \nelectricity supply by 2030. These investments will also contribute to promoting sustainable energy \nfor  all  (Sustainable  Development  Goal  7)  and  achieving  Nepal\u2019s  Nationally  Determined \nContributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to reduce the \ncountry\u2019s dependency on fossil fuel by 50%.3  \n \n6.  Nepal Electricity Authority. The executing agency of the project, NEA, was established \non 16 August 1985 under the Nepal Electricity Authority Act, 1984 as the main national utility \nresponsible for generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity in the country. NEA has \nhistorically been under-resourced and hampered by inadequate end-use tariffs, leading to poorly \nmaintained assets, unserved demand for electricity, and crippling financial losses. At the same \ntime, it has been compelled to extend its network into rural areas without adequate returns and to \nprovide grid connections to independent power producers at power purchase rates that it cannot \nafford. NEA has been governed in a manner that has hampered performance improvement. \nInvestment  priorities  and  tariff-setting  have  regularly  been  politicized,  resulting  in  an \nunsustainable debt burden on NEA. Significant improvements have become evident in 2017 to \n2019, however, driven by a significant tariff increase, NEA\u2019s commitment to reduce distribution \nlosses and load-shedding, more effective and decisive management of the power system, and a \ngovernment-backed financial restructuring plan for NEA.4 These measures have helped NEA \ndeliver continuous electricity supply to its consumers in Kathmandu and to make operating profits. \nThe government and NEA have demonstrated genuine commitment to maintaining this reform \nmomentum. \n \n3  Government  of  Nepal,  Ministry  of  Population  and  Environment.  2016.  Nationally  Determined  Contributions. \nKathmandu. \n4  Key features of financial restructuring plan approved and executed in FY2017 include conversion of foreign loans & \ncertain power import costs payable to government into equity, reduction of interest rate on government funded loans \nfrom 8% to 5% and reversal of share capital previously reimbursed for import losses into income. Implementation of \nfinancial restructuring plan resulted in increase of share capital by NRs12.4 billion, conversion of long-term borrowing \ninto equity amounting to NRs14.6 billion and decrease in accumulated loss of NRs5.2 billion. The managing director \nhas also signed performance contracts with the chiefs of the regional offices and project managers with a target to \nreduce its loss, control leakage, reduce administrative expenses, settle outstanding dues, and increase the number \nof consumers. ", "3 \n7.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  other  development  partners  have  been \ncontinuing their support for the government\u2019s power system reform efforts; the promulgation of \nthe Nepal Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 2017 is an important milestone in that regard. \nThrough this legislation, the government has effectively removed itself from direct electricity \nregulation, particularly with respect to tariff-setting and consumer protection, which have been \nbrought under the Electricity Regulatory Commission (ERC). The ERC has been operational since \nmid-May 2019 and is preparing to assume increased responsibility as the principal independent \nregulatory  body  for  electricity.  The  government  and  NEA  are  proceeding  with  structural \nunbundling and creation of separate entities for generation, transmission, distribution, and power \ntrading, and the complex task of devolution of responsibility for electricity distribution to provincial \nauthorities  is  underway.5  The  overall  improvements  in  the  energy  sector  have  facilitated \ncommercial investment in the 216 MW Upper Trishuli-1 Hydropower Project, which is the largest \nprivate sector hydropower project under development with international investment participation, \nincluding ADB\u2019s nonsovereign financing. At the same time, the government has recognized that \nimproving NEA\u2019s technical and commercial viability is a prerequisite for attracting significant \nprivate investment. In particular, improving NEA\u2019s network to deliver reliable electricity to and \naround the country\u2019s existing and planned commercial and industrial hubs will increase and \ndiversify NEA\u2019s revenue base away from Kathmandu. This investment, along with NEA\u2019s ongoing \nefforts to modernize its asset register and revalue its generation and network assets, will facilitate \ndevolution of NEA\u2019s distribution assets to provincial authorities and promote transparency. \n \n8.  ADB assistance to the sector. ADB is a major development partner supporting Nepal\u2019s \nenergy sector in the generation, transmission, and distribution subsectors with an active sovereign \nportfolio of about $630 million as of December 2019. ADB and other development partners are \nactively engaged in policy and institutional reforms, policy dialogues, knowledge products and \nservices, and essential capacity building. To reflect lessons from earlier projects, particularly with \nrespect to land acquisition and advanced procurement action, project readiness criteria have been \ndeveloped for the overall project portfolio. The most recent energy sector project approved by \nADB for Nepal in 2017 focuses on construction of new grid substations, reinforcement and \nmodernization of electricity distribution infrastructure within the Kathmandu Valley, and a smart \nmetering rollout; implementation performance of this project has been satisfactory.6 Also, ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department is supporting the Upper Trishuli-1 Hydropower Project, \nwhich was approved in April 2019.7 ADB will continue to explore opportunities for public\u2013private \npartnerships and nonsovereign investments across the energy sector. \n \n9.  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic  Cooperation  Program.  The  project  is  closely \naligned with the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) Program to help Nepal \nimprove its energy security by developing infrastructure and promoting intraregional power trade. \nThe project is aligned with the SASEC Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025 Update\u2019s priorities for energy \nwhich include (i) improving interconnections to access large-scale electricity and natural gas \nresources; (ii) harnessing unutilized regional indigenous hydropower potential; (iii) developing \nlow-carbon  energy  (wind  and  solar);  and  (iv)  facilitating  bilateral  and regional  coordination \nmechanisms, including knowledge sharing.8 The project will support upgrading of substations in \nKhimti, Barhabise, and Lapsiphedi to enable full operation of the transmission line passing \n \n5  NEA has already realigned its regional offices to harmonize with the provincial geographical coverage and has started \nkeeping separate financial and performance records. \n6  ADB. 2017.

The upgrading of these substations will facilitate export of excess electricity to \nneighboring countries and import of electricity to meet domestic demand during the winter periods \n(October to March) using energy banking.9 \n \n10.  Alignment with ADB priorities. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Nepal, 2020\u20132024 \nsupports the government's development objective of accelerated and inclusive economic growth.10 \nThis project is fully aligned with the strategy to focus on energy sector reform and financial \nsustainability,  and  to  strengthen  transmission  and  distribution  systems  to  support  regional \ncooperation and integration. The project is aligned with six operational priorities under ADB\u2019s \nStrategy 2030.11 It will contribute to addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities by \nstrengthening the distribution network in Province 2, where 35% of the population is poor (compared \nwith the national average of 29%). The project will contribute to accelerating progress in gender \nequality by targeting women and poor households headed by women for awareness-raising on \nefficient  and  safe  use  of  electricity,  energy-based  livelihood  activities,  and  new  electricity \nconnections in Province 2. It will help address climate change by upgrading transmission and \ndistribution system to reduce systems losses and evacuate hydropower and improve the urban \nenvironment in the Kathmandu Valley and environs. Regional cooperation and integration will be \nsupported by strengthening transmission infrastructure for cross-border power exchange with India. \nSimilarly, the project will help address strengthening governance and institutional capacity through \nthe investment and TA.  \n  \n11.  National emergency resilience and post-pandemic recovery. The project has become \neven more relevant as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Reinforcing electricity networks in \nurban centers and commercial hubs is essential to underpin and sustain post-pandemic economic \nrecovery. These interventions are also needed to provide resilience to shocks (such as the \nCOVID-19 pandemic). In response to the pandemic, the government has temporarily closed \nbusinesses and schools and confined people to their homes for extended periods of time. This, \nin turn, has highlighted the importance of providing reliable electricity supply to all so that \nvulnerable communities are not disproportionately penalized and can recover quickly in times of \ncrisis now and in the future. Further, the project\u2019s support to NEA\u2019s initiatives to automate its \nnetwork operations will reduce the need for human intervention, thereby improving NEA\u2019s ability \nto  maintain  electricity  supply  during  national  emergencies  such  as  pandemics  and  natural \ndisasters.  \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n12.  The project is aligned with the following impacts: (i) reliable and efficient electricity for all \nachieved by 2028,12 and (ii) energy trade infrastructure in SASEC countries improved.13 The \nproject will have the following outcome: access, reliability, and efficiency of power supply in Nepal \nimproved.14 \n \n \n9  The power secretaries of India and Nepal are currently engaged in high-level discussions on energy banking \narrangements. \n10 ADB. 2019.

Output 1: Power system transmission capacity increased. The project will finance      \n(i) upgrading of three substations by 1,265 megavolt amperes (MVA), 400 kV from 220 kV in \nKhimti 1, Barhabise, and Lapsiphedi in Bagmati Province to enhance capacity for evacuation of \nelectricity from hydropower stations for domestic consumption, and for exportation of excess \nelectricity; and (ii) upgrading of existing 15-kilometer (km) 132 kV double-circuit transmission lines \nfrom  the  Pathlaiya  substation  to  the  Parwanipur  substation  using  advanced  high-capacity \nconductors, and construction of new 2x65 MVA 132/33 kV and 1x45 MVA 132/11 kV substation \nand associated facilities at Pokhariya in Province 2. The latter will especially help cater to \nunserved demand and support industrial corridor development located in Province 2, which is a \npriority of the government. \n \n14.  Output 2: Distribution systems in the Kathmandu Valley, Bharatpur, and Pokhara, \nand consumers\u2019 awareness on energy efficiency and safety improved. This output will \ninclude (i) construction of a 12-kilometer underground 132 kV double-circuit transmission line from \nBhaktapur substation to Koteshwor; (ii) construction of a 2-kilometer 66 kV transmission line from \nKoteshwor to Baneswor, and a new 132/11 kV substation with automation in Koteshwor in the \nKathmandu Valley in Bagmati Province; (iii) modernization and reinforcement of the Kathmandu \nValley and Bharatpur distribution center in Chitwan district in Bagmati Province; and Pokhara \ndistribution center in Kaski district in Gandaki Province benefiting about 450,000 customers in \ntotal. Awareness on efficient use of electricity will be promoted especially among women and \ndisadvantaged groups. \n \n15.  Output 3: Distribution network and capacity of women to use electricity for energy-\nbased enterprises development in Province 2 improved. The project will support network \nextension and reinforcement by constructing 350 circuit-km (ckm) of 33 kV, 1,000 ckm of 11 kV, \nand 960 circuit-km of 0.4 kV distribution lines and substations to provide quality and reliable \nelectricity supply to 850,000 new and existing customers  in Province 2.15 The project will also \nsupport (i) energy-based development of women-led enterprises through awareness raising and \ntraining, and (ii) pilot demonstration on improved distribution center management  in Province 2. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n16.  ADB\u2019s support for development coordination and energy sector reforms is critical in \nmobilizing cofinancing from other sources, including from the Government of Norway, and \nleveraging its own resources to help the government meet the substantial financial and skills \nresource requirement in the energy sector. ADB has a long history of partnership with NEA and \na  record  of  providing  financial  assistance  with  progressive  loan  and  grant  covenants  and \nconditions aimed at ensuring NEA\u2019s institutional and financial recovery and improved governance. \nADB\u2019s continued involvement provides a valuable signal to investors and to other development \npartners that the government is committed to reforms, and that NEA is on a path to sustainability. \nThe project will build on the experience from other ADB projects, particularly on procurement \npackaging, implementation schedules, and stronger monitoring and supervision. ADB is also \ndrawing on its experience in promoting new technologies such as more efficient high temperature \nlow sag conductors as well as regional cooperation and integration to help Nepal quickly harness \nits indigenous renewable energy potential and deliver it into the subregional power trading market \nin SASEC countries.  \n \n \n15 Providing reliable power supply will complement a mechanized irrigation project in Province 2, which is being \nprocessed by the Environment, Natural Resources and Agriculture Division of ADB\u2019s South Asia Department. \n ", "6 \nD.

The Ministry of Finance will relend the loan to NEA on the same terms as ADB, and provide \nthe grant supported by Norway to NEA as grant. NEA will serve as the executing agency and will \nimplement all activities under the ADB loan through its Project Management Directorate (PMD). \nNEA will assign a dedicated team for this project headed by a project director. The establishment \nof a dedicated PMD for ADB projects and streamlined internal NEA management practices (such \nas  having  a  managing  director  to  make  all  procurement  decisions)  has  improved  NEA\u2019s \nperformance in project implementation. Project supervision consultants will be recruited to support \nNEA in implementing the project. All procurement, including consulting services, will follow the \nADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and Procurement Regulations for \nADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated staff instructions and/or \nproject administration instructions. Universal procurement will also be applied to this project given \nthe cofinancing arrangement with the Government of Norway. \n \n23.  For project implementation, turnkey contracts will be tendered. Construction activities will \nrequire 60 months to complete. The total time for project implementation after loan effectiveness \nis  estimated  at  5  years  and  6  months  for  detailed  design,  bidding,  construction,  and \ncommissioning. The government has set up a high-level coordination committee comprising \nrepresentatives of key government agencies and other stakeholders to ensure coordination \namong different agencies (dealing with roads, water supply, sewage, and telecommunications \nand cable television operators), and provide necessary support and guidance to NEA.  \n \n24.

ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n25.  The TA will support NEA in implementing the project. It will help NEA in implementing the \ngender action plan (GAP) and fill the gaps in NEA\u2019s capacity for mainstreaming gender in its \noperations, building on previous support. The TA will provide much-needed capacity development \nsupport to ensure that, under NEA\u2019s operations, the energy needs of poor and disadvantaged \ncommunities  are  addressed;  social  safeguard  risks  minimized;  and  results  and  impacts \nmaximized, documented, and reported. The TA will provide consultancy services to assist NEA \nstaff in implementing the project and introducing new models of managing distribution centers.  \nThe TA will also support the Ministry of Energy, Water Resources and Irrigation; the Department \nof Electricity Development; NEA; and the newly established ERC to implement sector reforms, \nincluding the new regulatory requirements of ERC. The TA will also support identification of poor \nand disadvantaged people targeted for electricity connection, and develop viable modality to \nsupport them, including energy-based enterprise development. The TA will be implemented over \n5 years and will be administered by ADB in close coordination with NEA and the ERC. An \ninternational consultancy firm, in partnership with a national nongovernment organization or firm, \nwill provide technical support for TA implementation. ADB will engage the consultants following \nthe ADB Procurement Policy and the Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers, and its \nassociated staff instructions and/or project administration instructions. Necessary consultations \nwere held with NEA and ERC officials, and the TA concept and its implementation modality were \nagreed upon. Details of the TA are included in the Attached Technical Assistance Report.19 \n \n26.  The TA is estimated to cost $5.1 million, of which $5.0 million20 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Government of Norway and administered by ADB. The government and NEA will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of staff, office space and supplies, and other in-kind \ncontributions. All disbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical \n \n27.  The  project  aims  to  enhance  the  quantity  and  quality  of  power  supplied  to  NEA\u2019s \ncustomers  in  and  outside  of  the  Kathmandu  Valley.  This  will  require  (i)  augmentation  of \ntransmission substations; (ii) reconstruction and upgrading of medium-voltage and low-voltage \ndistribution networks; and (iii) introduction of smart grid elements. Due diligence was undertaken \nto confirm that the cost estimates are reasonable and unit costs compare favorably with similar \nrecent ADB projects in India and Nepal. \n \n28.  The proposed transmission and distribution facilities follow planning and design practices \nalready being implemented by NEA in other projects. Additional scrutiny will be imposed to ensure \nthat construction standards are high and reflect international best practice in terms of works \nsupervision. Overall, the proposed works follow international good practice and are considered \ntechnically acceptable. The project design also incorporates climate change-related aspects and \nwill contribute to reduction of 78,724 tCO  per year by reducing losses and providing new \n2\nconnection with clean source of energy, and the project is categorized low risk in the climate \nchange assessment.21  \n \n19 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n20 The actual amount is NKr45 million. \n21 Climate Change Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n29.  Economic viability. The project was analyzed for economic viability in accordance with \nADB\u2019s guidelines for economic analysis.22 A with-project and without-project framework was \nadopted, and subprojects were grouped by outcome (subproject \u201cclusters\u201d), rather than by \ncomponent. The economic internal rate of return of the overall project is 13.9%. Sensitivity \nanalysis demonstrates that the project\u2019s expected economic performance is robust under a range \nof downside scenarios. \n \n30.  Financial viability. Financial analysis of the project was carried out in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.23 All financial costs and \nbenefits were expressed in constant 2019 prices. The project\u2019s weighted average cost of capital \nwas estimated at 4.8% (in pretax real terms). Even assuming gradually declining tariffs in real \nterms, the project is forecast to deliver an overall financial internal rate of return of 7.4%.24 \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n31.  NEA has historically been plagued by poor financial performance and low debt-repaying \ncapacity on account of suboptimal operational performance, substantial and expensive power \nprocurement from independent power producers within Nepal and from India, and stagnant tariffs. \nIt posted an annual loss of NRs9 billion during FY2016 and its accumulated losses had risen to \nNRs35 billon by the end of FY2016. However, a strong commitment to reduce distribution losses \nand load-shedding, and a government-backed financial restructuring plan allowed NEA to post a \nnet profit of NRs1.5 billion in FY2017 (its first profit in more than a decade), with profit increasing \nto NRs2.9 billion in FY2018. With the commissioning of a number of new private- and state-owned \npower generation plants and the establishment of the ERC in 2018, the short- to medium-term \nfinancial outlook for NEA is increasingly favorable. While high volume of outstanding debts and \nNEA\u2019s capacity to repay due to limited profits are of some concern, continued profitability, strong \nfinancial support by the government, and likely improvements in tariffs following the establishment \nof the ERC are likely to adequately address the issue. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n32.  Financial management. The financial management assessment of NEA, conducted in \nSeptember 2016 for the Power Transmission and Distribution Efficiency Enhancement Project, \nwas updated in accordance with ADB guidelines.25 Based on the assessment, the key financial \nmanagement risks remain because of (i) NEA\u2019s current spreadsheet-based accounting system, \nwhich is inflexible, prone to errors, and inadequate for an entity of NEA\u2019s size and complexity;     \n(ii) inflated assets and liabilities requiring write-down; (iii) inadequate resolution of audit issues; \n(iv) delays in the implementation of the enterprise resource planning-based integrated financial \nmanagement information systems; and (v) weak internal controls. A further concern arises from \nthe government\u2019s preference that for all future loans, NEA will borrow directly from development \npartners in foreign currency with a sovereign guarantee. Additionally, NEA had difficulty in \ncomplying with financial covenants under previous ADB loans, in particular the current ratio, \nalthough recent improvements in NEA\u2019s financial results are encouraging. Based on the above, \nNEA\u2019s overall pre-mitigation financial management risk is substantial. A number of initiatives are \n \n22 ADB. 2017. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects.

These are part of the time-bound \nfinancial management action plan agreed with NEA and are reflected in the loan agreement. \nThese  measures  include  the  deployment  of  enterprise  resource  planning  implementation, \ncompletion of fixed assets verification, conversion of financial statements to Nepal Financial \nReporting Standards, introduction of internal audit and financial management manuals, and \nimplementation of a risk management policy. \n \n33.  Procurement. A procurement capacity assessment of NEA was conducted as part of due \ndiligence. NEA has sufficient capacity and experience in local and foreign procurement, including \nADB\u2019s standard bidding procedures, through domestic projects and external assistance from \ndevelopment partners. Through strategic procurement planning, NEA is able to achieve value for \nmoney by using strategic contract packaging with combination of large and small packages, some \npackages with smaller lots, and lowest evaluated cost in the evaluation criteria. \n \n34.  Coronavirus disease 2019\u2019s impact on project implementation. The impact of the \nCOVID-19 pandemic on the project has been reviewed by ADB and NEA. Because the project \nhas an implementation period of 5.5 years with physical work not expected to commence at least \nuntil June 2021, COVID-19 is not expected to cause any significant delays or cost increases. No \nchanges to implementation arrangements are considered necessary at this stage; NEA\u2019s PMD \ncontinues to work effectively and efficiently within the constraints imposed by the government\u2019s \nresponse to the pandemic. However, given the evolving trend and severity of the COVID-19 \nemergency, its potential impact will be regularly reviewed by NEA\u2019s PMD and ADB. \n \n35.  Anticorruption. Integrity due diligence was conducted.26 No significant integrity risks \nwere identified. ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and \ndiscussed with the government and NEA. The specific policy requirements and supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM. \n \nE.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n36.  Nepal\u2019s per capita gross domestic product is one of the lowest in the world at about $993.9 \nin 2018. About 80% of the country\u2019s population lives in rural areas where poverty is more prevalent \nand severe. The Government of Nepal, in pursuit of Sustainable Development Goal 1 (end poverty \nin all its forms everywhere), aims to further reduce poverty significantly by the end of 2030. \nHowever, limited access to modern energy resources and inefficient grid connectivity have been \nhindering development. The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionate impacts on the poor, \ninformal sector workers, migrant workers, households depending on remittances, and women. \nWith the economic disruption caused by the pandemic, vulnerable individuals, including those \nwho are just above the poverty line, are likely to be pushed below the poverty line. Nepal\u2019s \nestimated poverty headcount ratios of 3.9% at $1.90 per day, 27.6% at $3.20 a day, and 65.1% \nat $5.50 a day for FY2020 are projected to increase to 4.8% at $1.90 a day, 30.5% at $3.20 a \nday, and 68.1% at $5.50 day from FY2020 to FY2021.27 The project aims to enhance the \ndistribution capacity, improve the reliability and quality of electricity, and help reduce technical \nlosses in the project areas. The project will create employment opportunities for skilled and \nunskilled labor during the construction phase, and in the medium to long-term by promoting \nenergy-based enterprises in poor communities. Moreover, using cleaner energy will improve \nurban and rural air quality, people\u2019s health, living conditions, and overall quality of life. The project \n \n26  ADB. 2003.

Through the \nattached TA, the project will include strengthening the capacity of NEA to (i) institutionalize gender \nequality and social inclusion (GESI);28 (ii) implement a gender action plan (GAP) to support the \nparticipation of women, the poor and excluded groups in project activities; and (iii) support women \nand disadvantaged groups to productively use energy with safety and efficiency. The social \nsafeguards unit and GESI team will monitor and supervise implementation of the GAP. \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n37.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.29 \n \n38.  Environment (category B). An initial environmental examination (IEE) was prepared per \nADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and disclosed on the ADB website on 24 February \n2020. Public consultations were held as part of the IEE, and more consultations with a special \nfocus on women and vulnerable groups will take place during implementation. In addition, as the \nproject involves existing facilities (substations), environmental audits were conducted, and results \nare summarized in the IEE. The project is not expected to cause significant environmental \nimpacts. Potential impacts are mostly temporary, predictable, and generally reversible, although \nrisks related to bird collisions, pollution, health, and safety will remain during operation. Impacts \ncan be mitigated through implementation of the environmental management plan included in the \nIEE. NEA has assured ADB that works within Parsa National Park will be confined to the existing \nright-of-way from Pathlaiya substation, works within the Lake Cluster of the Pokhara Valley \nRamsar site will be confined to the existing road, and works in the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve \nbuffer zone will not encroach into this site; site-specific biodiversity management plans are to be \ncleared by ADB before any works in the respective areas can take place. No other works will take \nplace within the boundaries or buffer zones of internationally important biodiversity or cultural \nheritage areas. NEA has experience in implementing ADB projects and sufficient capacity to \nimplement the environmental safeguards. In addition, environment consultants will support NEA \nand provide trainings to develop NEA staff capacity on environmental safeguards implementation. \n \n39.  Involuntary resettlement (category B) and indigenous peoples (category C). Ten \nsubstations require the acquisition of private land (5.69 hectares in total), which will affect an \nestimated 17 households with 92 people. No permanent or temporary structures need to be \nrelocated. Among the affected households, three are losing more than 10% of their land. Surface \ndisturbance during the construction of underground distribution lines and overhead line restringing \nwill have temporary impacts. Social surveys and consultations were undertaken in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009). The project\u2019s social impacts were adequately \nassessed,  and  compensation  will  be  paid  to  the  affected  people  commensurate  with  the \nreplacement  costs.  A  resettlement  plan  covering  all  components  has  been  prepared  and \ndisclosed on the ADB website on 24 February 2020. Budgetary provisions are in place to \ncompensate affected people, including non-title holders, for their losses in a timely manner. The \nloan agreement includes a standard assurance related to the resettlement impacts and social \nmatters. NEA has its own environment division, which also covers social aspects, and it has \nprevious experience with land acquisition. Implementation consultants will be engaged to assist \nthe PMD and strengthen its capacity. The implementation of the resettlement plan will be \n \n28 Gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) is a concept that addresses unequal power relations between women \nand men and between different social groups.
