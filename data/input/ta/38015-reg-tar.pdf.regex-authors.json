INTRODUCTION \n1.  Following  the  request  of  the  governments  of  Cambodia,  Lao  People\u2019s  Democratic \nRepublic  (Lao  PDR),  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC),  and  Viet  Nam  (the  participating \ncountries) for a regional technical assistance (TA) to prepare the Greater Mekong Subregion \n(GMS) Sustainable Tourism Development Project, an Asian Development Bank (ADB) mission \nvisited the participating countries from 22 August to 3 September 2005. The mission held \ndiscussions  with  the  GMS  national  coordinators,  and  officials  from  the  national  tourism \norganizations (NTOs) and the ministries of finance. On the basis of these discussions, the \nmission  reached  an  understanding  with  the  governments  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost \nestimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the project preparatory TA, and \nthe terms of reference for the consultants.1 The governments of Cambodia, Lao PDR, and Viet \nNam have officially expressed interest in availing themselves of ADB funds for the ensuing \nloans. The Government of PRC, while interested in participating in this TA, will assess at a later \ndate the possibility of borrowing from ADB. It has been proposed that ADB consider financing \nensuing loan projects in 2007. The TA has been included in the GMS Regional Strategy and Program \n(RCSP) 2005\u20132008.2 The preliminary project framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  GMS  comprises  six  countries  (Cambodia,  Lao  PDR,  Myanmar,  PRC  [Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province], Thailand, and Viet Nam) that share the \nMekong River and other important natural and cultural resources. The physiography of the \nsubregion supports a vast ecosystem ranging from alpine ecologies in the far north and cool \ntemperate ecologies in central Yunnan to subtropical monsoonal forest ecologies in the central \nand eastern parts of the subregion and tropical forest ecologies in the southern portions. In \naddition, the watersheds of the subregion support a vast marine ecosystem in the Andaman \nSea, the Gulf of Thailand, and the coastal areas of Viet Nam and of Guangxi in PRC including \nthe Gulf of Tonkin. The watersheds and marine ecosystems of the subregion have nurtured a \ndiverse, ancient, and rich human culture and cultural heritage that is unique to the planet and is \nan important resource for tourism. \n \n3.  The diversity and richness of the subregion\u2019s natural and tangible as well as intangible \ncultural heritage resources supports a substantial tourism flow to and within the subregion, as \nwell as a growing investment in tourism-related infrastructure, facilities, and services. In 2004, \ninternational tourism is estimated to have generated more than 16.3 million international tourist \narrivals, $14.7 billion in total receipts, $22.2 billion in total economic output, $18.6 billion in net \neconomic income, and $2.3 billion in government revenue, and sustained 3.8 million jobs in the \nGMS. International tourism increased at an annual average rate of 8% between 1995 and 2004. \nAs a result of increased connectivity and interest in the subregion as a tourist destination, it is \nprojected that by 2015 total international tourism arrivals alone will increase to around 46 \nmillion.  Thus,  the  tourism  sector  is  seen  as  a  major  growth  engine  for  socioeconomic \ndevelopment and poverty reduction. It can also promote the conservation of natural and cultural \nheritage in the subregion.  \n \n4.  The GMS countries have prepared a GMS tourism sector strategy, which identifies \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 2 February 2005 under the title \u201cPro-\nPoor Tourism Improvements.\u201d  \n2  ADB. 2005. Greater Mekong Subregion: Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008). \nManila. \n ", "2   \ntourism, when done correctly, as one of the major contributors to the goals and objectives of the \nGMS 10-year strategic framework for economic cooperation. However, a review of the tourism \nsector in the subregion, done during the preparation of the strategy, has shown that, left to itself, \ntourism development does not necessarily contribute to those objectives. At present, most of the \neconomic benefits of tourism in the subregion are concentrated in one country (Thailand, which \naccounts  for  around  69%  of  total  arrivals,  75%  of  total  visitor  days,  and  74%  of  total \nexpenditure) and the distribution of the benefits to those in greatest need\u2014disadvantaged \ngroups, such as the poor, women, and ethnic communities\u2014is minimal. The quality of the key \nnatural and cultural heritage sites of importance to tourism is steadily eroding while the negative \nsocial impact of tourism is increasing because of rapid, unmanaged tourism growth. In spite of \nrecent progress, tourists still cannot move easily to and within the subregion and face difficulties \ncrossing borders. The capacity of both public and private sectors to plan and manage tourism \ndestinations and good-quality services efficiently is limited.  \n \n5.  Some  of  the  main  factors  underlying  these  problems  are:  (i)  inadequate  product \ndevelopment and promotion at the subregional level; (ii)  high levels of imports associated with \ntourism expenditures resulting from weak economic linkages between tourism and other sectors \nof the economy; (iii) inadequately developed tourism-related infrastructure; (iv) weak standards \nof management at natural and cultural heritage sites of importance to tourism; (v) lack of \ncapacity to confront the negative social consequences of tourism; (vi) poor quality of land border \ncheckpoints and overly restrictive cross-border regulations and procedures; (vii) weak human \nresource  capacity  and  training  programs  in  the  public  and  private  sector\u2014especially  in \nvocational skills at small to medium-scale hospitality enterprises; and (viii) weak private sector \ninstitutions and participation in tourism planning, development, and marketing. The key issues \nfacing the development of the tourism sector will be not so much about anticipating future short-\nterm growth, but about managing the pattern of growth so that it is more environmentally and \nsocially sustainable, more equitable and pro-poor, and more sensitive to disadvantaged and \nvulnerable groups, particularly women and ethnic communities. \n \n6.  To  foster  multi-country  tourism,  the  GMS  countries  have  cooperated  since  1993  in \npromoting the subregion as a single destination through the establishment of a GMS tourism \nworking group, the Agency for Coordinating Mekong Tourism Activities, and the \u201cJewels of the \nMekong\u201d campaign. To facilitate access, ensure the environmental sustainability of tourism \ndevelopment in key tourist areas, and promote poverty reduction in the Mekong, the GMS \ncountries  have  received  assistance  from  ADB  and  other  development  partners.  ADB\u2019s \nassistance included the preparation of the Mekong/Lancang River Tourism Planning Study3 and \nthe GMS: Mekong Tourism Development Project (MTDP)4 involving the development of 12 \ntourism-related infrastructure projects, pro-poor community-based tourism development, and \nsubregional cooperation.  \n \n7.  Past human resource development initiatives have focused on enhancing the skills of \ntourism leaders, trainers, and professional managers through various TA projects led by the \nUnited Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific with the support of \nother  development  partners  like  ADB,  the  World  Tourism  Organization,  and  the  Tourism \nAuthority of Thailand. These have included TA to train trainers in tourism and tourism hospitality \nskills  development  in  the  GMS.  The  United  Nations  Educational,  Scientific  and  Cultural \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1997.

Manila. \n ", "  3\nOrganization has been the focal point of initiatives to raise standards in the management of \nnatural and cultural heritage for conservation and tourism in the subregion.  \n \n8.  In response to the need for a more strategic approach to the problems of the tourism \nsector, the GMS countries sought and received technical assistance from ADB to formulate a \ntourism sector strategy and action plan5 for 2006\u20132015. The primary focus of the strategy is to \npromote the subregion as a single destination by ensuring the sustainable expansion of the \ntourism sector and increasing the attractiveness of the subregion, to bring about a more pro-\npoor and equitable distribution of tourism benefits, while minimizing any negative social or \nenvironmental impact. The strategy addressees these issues through seven core programs: (i) \nmarketing the subregion as a single destination; (ii) developing human resource capabilities; (iii) \nenhancing the management of cultural and natural heritage areas of importance for tourism, and \naddressing the negative social impact of tourism; (iv) developing pro-poor tourism and a more \nequitable distribution of the benefits of tourism; (v) promoting private sector participation in the \ndevelopment of tourism; (vi) facilitating the movement of tourists to and within the subregion; \nand  (vii)  developing  tourism-related  infrastructure  to  support  the  first  six  initiatives.  The \nimplementation  of  the  strategy  will  be  coordinated  by  a  new  agency  to  be  established  in \nBangkok on 1 January 2006, the Mekong Tourism Coordinating Office (MTCO). \n \n9.  A review of the programs and related action plans with the countries during the fact- \nfinding mission indicated that the priority areas that need immediate support are the programs \nrelated  to  (i)  the  sustainable  development  of  tourism  in  natural,  cultural,  and  urban  sites; \n(ii) poverty reduction and social impact management; (iii) the facilitation of cross-border tourism; \nand (iv) human resource development. This TA seeks to prepare a project that will support the \nimplementation of the strategy in these areas. It will build on and develop the programs and \nprojects identified in the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy and the previous work of the tourism \nworking group. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The primary impact of this TA will be to develop a project that will contribute to the \nobjective of the GMS Tourism Sector Strategy of developing a pattern of tourism in the GMS \nthat is sustainable, equitable, pro-poor, socially responsible, and internationally competitive. The \nmain outcome of this TA is a feasibility study and a project design for priority tourism-related \ndevelopment subprojects in the GMS, which will serve as models and best-practice cases for \nsustainable and pro-poor tourism development. The Project will strengthen the sustainable \nmanagement of natural, cultural, and urban sites of importance to tourism; help reduce poverty \nand the undesirable social impact of tourism activities; facilitate the movement of tourists to and \nwithin  the  GMS;  and  improve  the  planning  and  management  capacity  of  tourism-related \ngovernment agencies, and service skills in the small and medium-size hospitality sector. The \nProject will also assess constraints and opportunities for the establishment of public-private \npartnerships  in  the  tourism  and  tourism-related  sectors.  The  TA  will  identify  and  prepare \nfeasibility studies on four types of subprojects: \n \n(i)  Sustainable tourism improvement subprojects of three types: (a) transnational \nnatural  heritage  sites  (biodiversity  corridors);  (b)  cultural  heritage  sites;  and \n(c) urban tourism sites that are under pressure from tourism. \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n ", "4   \n(ii)  Pro-poor tourism subprojects in pilot tourism areas, including improving tourist \naccess  to  poor  areas  with  tourism  potential  and  facilitating  the  provision  of \nservices and goods by poor communities in key tourism destinations. \n(iii)  Subprojects to facilitate cross-border tourism, including upgrading facilities and \ncross-border procedures in selected international border checkpoints with high \npriority for tourism development. \n(iv)  Human  resource  development  subprojects  to  upgrade  the  capacity  of \ngovernment officials at the national and provincial levels and at specific sites, and \nto improve the skills of vocational teachers in selected areas. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will be carried out in two phases: phase 1 will result in the selection of specific \nsites and subprojects that could be used as models for sector reforms and good practice \nthroughout the GMS; and phase 2 will involve the preparation of feasibility studies on those \nsubprojects. The TA will start with a review of the tourism sector, including lessons learned from \nprevious projects assisted by ADB, the participating countries, and development partners. The \ncurrent status of the sector, as well as institutional, policy, and human resource conditions, will \nbe assessed on the basis of the analysis done during the preparation of the GMS tourism sector \nstrategy, and opportunities and constraints will be identified. Data from surveys, interviews, \nfocus group discussions, and secondary data sources will be used to assess the potential for \ncommunity  participation  and  private  sector  involvement.  The  surveys  will  be  targeted  at \nhouseholds, while the interviews and focus group discussions will target specific groups such as \nfemales, the youth, community leaders, and government authorities. The opinions of these \nvarious groups will feed into the design of the project parameters and ensure broad-based \nparticipation and support for the Project. Three subregional and 10 national workshops will be \nheld to acquaint the communities and local government officials with the project objectives, \nobtain their support, and disseminate the findings of the TA. An investment forum will be \norganized to promote the establishment of public-private partnerships, attract investment from \nthe private sector, and assess mechanisms to promote socially responsible tourism at the \nsubregional level. ADB\u2019s participation requirement for the use of credit enhancements, including \nguarantees, in support of investment in the tourism sector may be satisfied through this TA.  \nProposed investment projects could be circulated separately to the Board for approval. \n \n12.  A participatory approach will be undertaken to ensure that the tourism facilities and \ncapacity-building programs for each component and each subproject are demand-driven. The \nTA will undertake the following activities: (i) review information and evaluate previous tourism \nprojects of ADB, the participating governments, and development partners; (ii) identify and \ndefine the project components and subprojects; (iii) prepare and implement field surveys to \nassess the socioeconomic status of potential beneficiaries and their involvement in and benefits \nfrom the tourism sector; (iv) prepare gender, social, and cultural assessments and necessary \naction plans, along with measures to mitigate any adverse impact on minority communities; (v) \nassess the resettlement impact and requirements and prepare a resettlement framework and \nplans; (vi) prepare environmental assessments and plans containing the necessary mitigation \nmeasures; (vii) prepare financial and economic analyses for each subproject; (viii) prepare \ninstitutional assessment and institutional development programs; (ix) conduct workshops to \nobtain critical inputs from stakeholders; and (x) design overall management and implementation \narrangements for the Project, and identify monitoring indicators. \n \n13.  An initial poverty and social assessment, which is a preliminary examination of poverty \nconditions, minority issues, resettlement effects, gender issues, and vulnerable groups in the \n ", "  5\nproject area, is in Appendix 2. All resettlement, environmental, and social assessments will be \ncarried out according to ADB\u2019s safeguard procedures, as indicated in the consultants\u2019 terms of \nreference. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $900,000 equivalent, comprising $570,000 in \nforeign exchange cost and $330,000 equivalent in local currency cost. The TA will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program to cover: (i) the remuneration, per diem, and \ntravel expenses of the international consultants; (ii) workshops, surveys, communication, and \nreports; and (iii) contingencies. Cost estimates are in Appendix 3. The governments have been \nadvised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing the ensuing Project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be ADB and the MTCO will assist in coordinating \nthe  TA.  The  NTOs  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.  Each  NTO  will  nominate  a  project \nmanager to guide the implementation of specific infrastructure subprojects, regulatory issues, \nand institutional strengthening measures. The managers will be responsible for coordinating \nwith local and provincial organizations, as well as with other national government organizations, \nnongovernment  organizations  (NGOs),  and  the  private  sector,  and  will  participate  in  the \nevaluations. \n \n16.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  10  months,  from  March  to  December  2006.  An \ninternational  consulting  firm  will  be  selected  through  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection \nmethod. Simplified technical proposals will be provided by the consultants. The TA will require \nabout  55  person-months  of  participation  by  a  team  of  consultants  (25  person-months  of \ninternational and 30 person-months of domestic consultants) with expertise in tourism planning, \ncivil engineering, economic and financial analysis, environmental assessment, private-public \npartnerships, and social, gender, and resettlement issues. The consultants will be recruited \naccording to ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Equipment to be provided under the \nTA will be purchased in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and given to the \nMTCO  after  the  TA.  All  bidders,  suppliers,  contractors,  and  consultants  shall  observe  the \nhighest standards of ethics in procuring and executing ADB-financed contracts and will be \nsubject to sanctions in  case of fraud and corruption. The consultants will have their main office \nin Bangkok, Thailand, and small offices in each of the participating countries. The terms of \nreference for the consulting services are outlined in Appendix 4. \n \n17.  The consultants will submit the following reports to ADB: (i) an inception report within 2 \nmonths of mobilization, which contains details of the consulting methodology and approach, \nstaffing and personnel, and activity schedule, and a list of selected subprojects for each project \ncomponent; (ii) an interim report within 5 months of mobilization, which includes a feasibility \nstudy on each project; (iii) a draft final report containing a refinement of the interim report and \ndetailed feasibility studies, to be submitted within 8 months of consultant mobilization; and (iv) a \nfinal report at the end of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis for \nPreparing the Sustainable Tourism Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact  Share of less- Annual reports from NTOs  Assumptions \nImplementation of a  developed GMS     \nproject that contributes  countries (other than  Annual reports from  \u2022  Countries willing to \nto the objective of the  Thailand) in total  national economic  borrow for the project  \nGMS tourism sector  arrivals in the subregion  agencies   \nstrategy of developing a  increases to 33% in    \u2022  Project coordination and \npattern of tourism in the  2010 and 41% in 2015;  Biennial surveys of  management are effective \nGMS that is  and these countries\u2019  natural, cultural, and   \nsustainable, equitable,  share in net income  historic sites in priority  Risks \npro-poor, socially  from tourism after  tourism zones   \nresponsible, and  leakage effects   \n\u2022  Weak executing and \ninternationally  (imports) increases to  Survey of NTO human \nimplementing agencies \ncompetitive  22% in 2010 and 37%  resource development \n \nin 2015.

Since 2002, GMS leaders have increasingly recognized the need for a \nsubregional approach to tourism development that  will promote the GMS as a single destination, enable the \nsustainable expansion of the tourism sector, increase the attractiveness of the subregion, bring about a more \nequitable distribution of tourism benefits, contribute to poverty reduction in the subregion, and reduce the negative \nsocial impact of poorly planned interventions. Two key ongoing initiatives are: (i) the Mekong Tourism Development \nProgram  (MTDP),  which  involves  tourism-related  infrastructure  development,  pro-poor  tourism  initiatives,  and \nsubregional cooperation activities in Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). and Viet Nam; and \n(ii) the GMS tourism sector strategy and action plan (2006\u20132015), which provides the basis for programs aimed at \nachieving a more sustainable, equitable, pro-poor, and socially responsible pattern of tourism.  \n \nThe technical assistance (TA) will prepare feasibility studies on priority tourism-related development projects in the \nGMS that follow the GMS tourism sector strategy. The projects will be designed to (i) strengthen the sustainable \nmanagement of natural and cultural sites, through environmental and other improvements; (ii) help reduce poverty and \nundesirable social impact from tourism; (iii) facilitate the movement of tourists; (iv) improve service skills in the small \nand medium-size hospitality sector; and (v) support private sector partnerships in tourism development. The projects \nare expected to contribute to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to poverty \nreduction (MDG-1), gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment (MDG-3), and environmental sustainability (MDG-7).  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe tourism sector is seen as a major growth engine for socioeconomic development and poverty reduction. In 2004, \ninternational tourism brought to the GMS more than 16.3 million international tourists, excluding the estimated 2.3 \nmillion who may have come from provinces near the main borders of the GMS. The international tourists generated \nabout $14.7 billion in total receipts, $22.2 billion in total economic output, $18.6 billion in net economic income, and \n$2.3 billion in government revenue. International tourism also created and sustained about 3.8 million jobs. From 1995 \nto 2004, international tourism grew by an average of 8% per year. By 2015, international tourism arrivals alone could \nincrease to around 46 million.  \n \nPoverty and social analyses will be required to (i) assess the poverty and social conditions of the population that will \nbe affected by the resulting project; (ii) explore the potential role, and later identify the level of involvement, of those \npoor communities in the tourism sector within their county and region; (iii) determine the types of impact\u2014positive or \nnegative\u2014of tourism activities on different population groups; (iv) identify measures to mitigate or help reduce the \nnegative effects of land acquisition and resettlement, as well as rapid economic development, on population groups \nand the environment; and (v) identify measures to support ongoing government programs or specific project activities \nand ensure more equitable project outcomes. The poverty and social analyses will be conducted in each of the \nparticipating GMS countries. They will build on the lessons learned from the MTDP, including local initiatives \nsupported by governments and other development partners, to better apply the concept of \u201cpro-poor\u201d tourism.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nA stakeholder analysis will be required to identify key project stakeholders, their project-related interests, and the ways \nin which these interests affect project feasibility and design. The stakeholders in the tourism industry in the GMS may \ninclude, but will not be limited to the poor, people affected by land acquisition and resettlement, ethnic minority groups, \nline ministries, local industries, private sector groups (such as tour operators), tourism authorities, and local and \nforeign tourists. The role of mass organizations (e.g., women\u2019s unions) and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) will \nalso be considered. A stakeholder analysis will be prepared for each country. Consultations will be carried out with \nstakeholders during project preparation. Participatory rural appraisal techniques will be used in designing project \ncomponents  and  arrangements  for  project  implementation,  operation  and  maintenance,  and  monitoring  and \nevaluation.  The  participatory  process  will  involve  information  sharing,  consultations,  socioeconomic  surveys, \ninterviews, focus group meetings, workshops, participatory rural appraisal, and collaborative decision making. Records \nof consultations will be noted and included in the poverty and social assessment and strategy. Disclosure of \ndocuments on the environmental, ethnic minorities, and resettlement will be in line with the public consultation policy \nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB). \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nOn the basis of the stakeholder analysis, a participation strategy will be prepared for each country. The strategy will \ndefine ways in which the participation of key stakeholders and beneficiaries in the Project can be enhanced.  \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nA detailed gender analysis will be conducted during project preparation, to determine how project benefits can be \nmaximized for women in the tourism industry. The roles, responsibilities, needs, and interests of both men and women \nwill be analyzed. Men and women play different roles and have a wide range of responsibilities in the tourism industry. \nWomen provide more up front services and have an important role in the home. If managed properly, tourism can \ncontribute to the promotion of gender equality and empower women (MDG-3). Environmental improvements, better \nawareness of hygiene and food safety, improved skills (through training), and more representation in managerial \npositions could strengthen women\u2019s role and increase their participation in the industry. Women are also more \nvulnerable to the negative social effects of tourism (e.g., HIV/AIDS, trafficking, and exploitation) because of gender \ninequality and fewer economic opportunities for women. The gender analysis will review and learn lessons from the \nMTDP.  \n \nHas an output been prepared?      Yes     No \nA gender action plan will be prepared for each participating country during project preparation. The action plans will \nspecify  actions,  estimated  budget,  responsible  implementing  agencies,  schedules,  and  monitoring  indicators. \nMeasures to manage and reduce the negative social impact of tourism activities on women will be included in the \nproject design. Particular attention will be given to ways to increase women\u2019s representation and enhance their \ndecision-making capabilities through awareness-raising, capacity-building, and employment campaigns. Women\u2019s \nparticipation through mass organizations or nongovernment organizations will also be considered. \n  \nE.  Social Safeguards and Other Social Risks \n Item  Significant/  Strategy to Address Issues  Plan \nNot Significant/    Required \nNone \nLand  acquisition  and  resettlement  (LAR)  will  be  avoided  or \nminimized whenever possible.

The technical assistance will be undertaken by a consulting firm in two parts.  \n \nA.  Part A: Subproject Identification \n \n2.  The consultant will identify priority subprojects on the basis of a review of previous \nstudies, surveys, and project proposals; consultations with the national tourism organizations \n(NTOs),  provincial  tourism  organizations,  and  other  related  agencies  in  the  participating \ncountries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS); site inspections; and discussions with local \nstakeholders. Specifically the consultant will do the following: \n \n(i)  Review subproject proposals included in the GMS tourism sector strategy, giving \nparticular attention to heritage conservation, tourism-related infrastructure, pro-\npoor tourism, social impact management, facilitation of tourist movement, and \nhuman resource development programs. \n \n(ii)  Review  national  and  provincial  plans,  programs,  and  projects  for  the \ndevelopment  of  public  infrastructure  required  for  tourism  development  and \nmanagement,  such  as  small  access  roads,  sanitation,  jetties,  markets, \nenvironmental improvements, and border facilities; review plans and proposals \nby the private sector for the development of tourism transportation services, \nresort facilities, tour operations, and handicraft production; and review current \nand  planned  support  from  the  development  partners  and  nongovernment \norganizations (NGOs) to the tourism sector in the participating countries and \nparticularly in the areas where potential subprojects have been identified. \n \n(iii)  Hold a wide range of consultations with NTOs, government agencies responsible \nfor the conservation of the natural and cultural heritage, immigration, security, \nand the economy; the tourism industry; international and bilateral development \nagencies; and local communities in the participating GMS countries to draw up a \nlong list of candidate subprojects for each project component. The subprojects \nshould be considered as pilot projects for the development of GMS models in \nheritage  conservation  for  tourism,  pro-poor  tourism,  facilitation  of  tourist \nmovement, and human resource development that provide solutions to the key \nproblems identified in the GMS tourism sector strategy. \n \n(iv)  Prepare criteria for the selection of subprojects. The criteria will include but will \nnot necessarily be limited to the following: the subprojects should be located \nwithin one of the 13 priority tourism zones identified in the GMS tourism sector \nstrategy;  be  reasonably  accessible  from  the  main  subregional  transportation \nnetwork; be located in an area where there is a high incidence of poverty; be \nlinked  with  other  initiatives  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  its \ndevelopment partners; require public sector financing; be financially feasible; be \neconomically viable; promote economic linkages in the local economy; distribute  \nthe benefits of tourism to local communities, especially the poor, women, and \nethnic groups, through enhanced employment opportunities and entrepreneurial \nactivity;  contribute  to  improved  sanitation,  access  to  services,  and  health  of \naffected  local  communities;  promote  the  sustainable  use  of  the  natural  and \ntangible  and  intangible  cultural  heritage,  especially  the  cultural  traditions, \ncustoms, and languages of ethnic groups; entail no major negative impact on the \nenvironment, o ethnic groups, and the land; and include measures to reduce the \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \nnegative social impact of tourism. The subprojects must be endorsed by the \nproposed executing agency, implementing agencies, and local communities. \n \n(v)  Through the application of agreed screening criteria, establish, in conjunction \nwith  the  NTOs,  provincial  government  tourism  organizations,  and  other \ngovernment agencies, a short list of candidate subprojects for each component; \nundertake site inspections of the short-listed subprojects with the concerned \nNTOs and related agencies; prepare concept papers for each subproject, which \ninclude broad environmental and social impact evaluations (including possible \nrequirements  for  social,  environment,  gender,  and  land  acquisition  and \nresettlement  plans),  as  well  as  initial  financial  and  economic  pre-feasibility \nevaluations based on broad project cost and operating income assumptions; and \nrecommend the final list of subprojects and sites to be included in the Project.  \n \n(vi)  On the basis of the GMS tourism sector strategy, identify key policy, institutional, \nand human resource constraints in the tourism sector in general and in cultural \nand natural heritage management, and environmental management of tourism \ndestinations, in particular; assess constraints on the movement of tourists to and \nwithin the GMS, particularly at international border checkpoints, the development \nof human resources, and the participation of the private sector in tourism; and \nrecommend short-, medium-, and long-term policy reforms to deal with these \nconstraints at subregional, national, and local levels. \n \n(vii)  Discuss  and  agree  on  the  results  of  the  initial  field  evaluation  and \nrecommendations with the concerned NTOs, provincial tourism organizations, \nand the related approving agencies; and prepare and present an inception report \nwith recommendations on the final scope, list, and description of subprojects.  \n \nB.  Part B: Feasibility Study of Priority Projects \n \n3.  Part B will involve the preparation of detailed financial, economic, environmental, and \nsocial feasibility studies on the subprojects identified in part A. On the basis of the results of part \nA, and immediately after the inception workshop, the consultant\u2019s full team will mobilize to \nprepare detailed feasibility studies of the selected subprojects as follows: \n \n(i)  Prepare feasibility-level project conceptual designs and cost estimates for all \ncandidate  subprojects  to  be  included  under  each  component  of  the  Project \nincluding topography, land use, geology, and hydrological conditions at the sites, \nand site visits to validate the land values and site features); and prepare detailed \neconomic  and  financial  analyses  for  each  subproject  and  a  financial \nmanagement assessment for each implementing agency. \n \n(ii)  Undertake poverty and social analyses, according to the draft ADB Handbook for \nPoverty and Social Analysis6 and ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Incorporation of Social \nDimensions  in  Bank  Operations,7  for  each  country  participating  in  the  TA, \nassessing for each subproject the poverty situation (including the number of \npeople living below the poverty line); and conduct a socioeconomic survey in \neach  subproject  area  to  gather  data  on  demographics,  ethnic  composition, \ngender roles (as part of gender analysis), education levels, household data, \nexpenditure patterns, income levels, occupations, access to services, and health \n                                                 \n6  ADB 2001.

Additional information on tourism development should be collected from \nlocal communities (e.g., local needs and preferences). The data from the survey \nwill be used in preparing socioeconomic and poverty profiles for the subproject \nareas. These data and profiles should be sufficiently comprehensive to serve as \nthe  baseline  for  poverty  and  social  monitoring.  The  surveys  should  be \ncomplemented  with  data  from  statistical  records,  household  surveys,  village \nsurveys,  and  key  informant  interviews  (e.g.,  with  local  government  officials, \nwomen\u2019s unions, community groups). The information should include population, \nincome levels, occupations, unemployment, education levels, health conditions, \nand  other  relevant  socioeconomic  data.  Data  should  be  disaggregated  by \ngender, ethnicity, and income, where relevant. \n \n(iii)  Review  national,  provincial,  and  local  government  policies,  strategies,  and \nprograms for poverty reduction and economic development as they pertain to the \nsubprojects; analyze how the proposed subprojects will complement government \ndevelopment programs; and consult with provincial and local governments to \nidentify  development  initiatives  that  could  complement  the  subprojects, \nparticularly those targeted at the poor, women, and ethnic minorities. \n \n(iv)  Assess the potential negative social impact of tourism development and growth \non affected communities, and propose measures to mitigate the impact or reduce \nthe risks involved. Special attention must be given to the impact of tourism or \nrapid economic growth on the vulnerable and marginalized groups. The risks \nposed by trafficking, the sexual exploitation of children, and diseases such as \nHIV/AIDS will be considered, and awareness-raising and preventive measures \nwill be integrated in the subproject designs.  \n \n(v)  Undertake  a  gender  analysis,  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Policy  on  Gender  and \nDevelopment8 and the relevant ADB gender checklists, to determine how to \nbetter maximize project benefits for women in the tourism industry, by analyzing \nthe  different  roles,  needs,  and  interests  of  men  and  women  in  the  tourism \nindustry; prepare a gender action plan for each participating country, with specific \nactions to address the needs of women, enhance their roles, and maximize their \nbenefits from the Project; and indicate targets, implementing agency, estimated \nbudget, proposed timing, and monitoring indicators for each planned action. \n \n(vi)  Identify the percentage of indigenous/ethnic minority groups in each subproject,; \nuse participatory methods to help assess the type and significance of subproject \nimpact on the ethnic minorities, including any gender-specific impact; consider \nmechanisms that could be introduced to help protect and enhance the value of \nthe tangible and intangible cultural heritage in the GMS; and prepare an ethnic \nminority development plan for each participating country (and for each province \nin the People\u2019s Republic of China [PRC]) according to ADB\u2019s Indigenous Peoples \nPolicy 9and in close consultation with the ethnic minority groups and relevant \nagencies. A suggested format for the plan is available.

The IEEs should be based on site \ninspection and should give special attention to the impact of site construction \nactivities, including off-site extraction of construction materials, and to the long-\nterm  operation  of  the  subprojects.  The  positive  and  negative  environmental \nimpact must be identified and consideration given to measures to monitor and \nmitigate  the  identified  adverse  impact  including  any  capacity-strengthening \nmeasures.  The  cost  of  mitigation  should  be  identified  and  included  in  the \nsubproject\u2019s  development  cost.  If  required,  terms  of  reference  should  be \nprepared, in consultation with the concerned stakeholders, for more detailed \nenvironmental assessments. The IEE report should be prepared according to \nADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002)12 and Environmental Assessment Guidelines \n(2003),13,  as  well  as  other  procedures  and  guidelines  for  environmental \nassessment required by the participating countries.
