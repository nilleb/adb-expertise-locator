I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \npolicy-based loan to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh, (ii) a proposed policy-based loan and \ngrant to the Kingdom of Bhutan, and (iii) a proposed policy-based grant to Nepal for the SASEC1 \nTrade Facilitation Program.2 \n \n2.  The program supports ADB\u2019s South Asia Regional Cooperation Strategy, 2011\u201320153 \nand the goals of SASEC. Its intended impact is to increase trade, including intraregional trade, \nof SASEC countries by reducing or removing non-tariff barriers (NTBs), specifically institutional, \nadministrative, and technical barriers to trade in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. While India is \nnot participating in the program because it is self-financing its trade facilitation reforms, it is part \nof the implementation through the SASEC Trade Facilitation and Transport Working Group \n(TFTWG).4 The program\u2019s intended outcome is to support a more efficient, transparent, secure, \nand  service-oriented  processing  of  trade  in  the  subregion.  To  achieve  this,  it  will  support \nactivities under three thematic areas: (i) modern and effective customs administration and/or \nmanagement;  (ii)  streamlined  and  transparent  trade  processes  and  procedures;  and \n(iii) improved services and information for private sector traders and investors, including women \nentrepreneurs. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Strong commitment to fostering subregional trade. A high-level forum in Manila in \n2010 set three SASEC priorities: trade facilitation, transport, and energy. Subsequently, SASEC \nTFTWG meetings were held in Bangkok in October 2011 and Kolkata in March 2012 to discuss \npriority initiatives, as follows: (i) subregional trade facilitation, (ii) cross-border road corridor and \nborder  infrastructure  development,  and  (iii)  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  capacity \nbuilding and institutional strengthening for transport and trade facilitation. The inclusion of trade \nfacilitation  reflects  both  ADB\u2019s  South  Asia  Regional  Cooperation  Strategy  and  SASEC\u2019s \nrecognition of both the problems and opportunities in this area, as discussed below. \n \n4.  South  Asia  one  of  the  world's  least  integrated  regions.  Despite  South  Asia\u2019s \nimpressive growth since the early 2000s, it remains one of the least integrated regions in the \nworld.  South  Asia  accounts  for  only  2%  of  world  trade,  and  1.7%  of  world  foreign  direct \ninvestment.5 Intraregional trade is less than 6% of the region\u2019s total trade. In comparison, \nintraregional trade as a share of total trade for Latin America is 17%; Middle East and North \nAfrica, 8%; and East Asia, 55%. South Asia\u2019s intraregional trade is lower than that of other \nregions even after factors such as geographic proximity, income levels, and population are \ntaken into account.6 At the same time, estimates of informal trade are high, perhaps as much as \n                                                 \n1   SASEC stands for South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation, covering Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal. \n2  The program\u2019s design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n3  ADB. 2011. South Asia: Regional Cooperation Strategy, 2011\u20132015. Manila.  \n4  Trade facilitation refers to the reduction of costs related to \u201ctransportation logistics and customs administration \nassociated with cross-border trade\u201d as well as \u201cthe environment in which trade transactions take place, which \nincludes the transparency of trade policy and regulation, as well as product standards, infrastructure to support \ntrade, and technology as it applies to lowering trade costs\u201d. See P. Sourdin and R. Pomfret, Trade Facilitation: \nDefining, Measuring, Explaining, and Reducing the Cost of International Trade, Edward Elgar: 2012, p.5. \n5  International Monetary Fund. 2010.

The World Bank\u2019s classification \nof  East  Asia  includes  the  countries  in  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  while  ADB\u2019s ", "2 \n72% of formal trade.7 Thus, there is enormous potential for greater subregional trade impacts in \nterms of economies of scale, increased competition, and technology spillovers, which in turn will \nlead to a bigger market and foster faster regional and global integration.8  \n \n5.  Higher costs of trade in South Asia. South Asia fares poorly relative to other regions \non transaction costs and processing time. It takes on average 32 days for exports to reach their \ndestinations, which is the same average export time of Sub-Saharan Africa. Compared with \nEast Asia and the Pacific, South Asia\u2019s export time is 31% longer, and administrative fees and \nstorage and handling costs are 43% more expensive (Table 1).   \n \nTable 1: Trade Indicators by Region \n      Cost to    Time  Cost to \n  Documents to  Time to  Export  Documents  to  Import \n  Export  Export  ($ per  to Import  Import  ($ per \nRegion  (number)  (days)  container)  (number)  (days)  container) \nEast Asia and Pacific  6.5  21.9  906  7.0  23.0  954 \nEastern Europe and  6.9  27.0  1,774  7.8  28.8  1,990 \nCentral Asia \nLatin America and  6.4  17.8  1,257  6.9  19.6  1,546 \nCaribbean \nMiddle East and North  6.3  19.7  1,057  7.6  23.6  1,238 \nAfrica \nOECD (high-income)  4.4  10.5  1,032  4.8  10.7  1,085 \nSouth Asia  7.8  32.1  1,590  8.9  32.5  1,768 \nSub-Saharan Africa  7.7  31.5  1,960  8.5  37.1  2,502 \nOECD = Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. \nSource: World Bank. 2012. Doing Business. Washington, DC. \n \n6.  Subregional  trading  costs  particularly  high.  Within  SASEC,  the  two  landlocked \ncountries of Bhutan and Nepal have especially high trading costs because of their distance from \nports and low volume of containers. Moreover, the two countries also require a high number of \ndocuments  for  trading,  i.e.,  close  to  twice  the  average  of  Organization  of  Economic  Co-\noperation and Development countries (Table 2). \n \nTable 2: Trading Costs within Subregion \nRanking  Time  Cost to \n(trading  Documents  to  Cost to  Documents  Time to  Import \nacross  to Exports  Export  Export ($ per  to Import  Import  ($ per \nCountry  borders)  (number)  (days) container) (number)  (days)  container)\nBangladesh  115  6  25  965  8  31  1,370 \nBhutan  169  8  38  2,230  12  38  2,805 \nIndia  109  8  16  1,095  9  20  1,070 \nNepal  162  9  41  1,960  9  35  2,095 \nSource: World Bank. 2012.

Unsurprisingly, the World Bank\u2019s logistics \nperformance index (LPI) shows that South Asia is the second least efficient region in the world, \n                                                                                                                                                          \nclassification only includes People's Republic of China; Hong Kong, China; Republic of Korea; Mongolia; and \nTaipei,China. \n7  Nisha Taneja. 2005.

Nontariff barriers to trade. The high costs of trade and the poor logistics performance \nin  South  Asia  are  due  in  part  to  infrastructure  deficits.  Poor  infrastructure  limits  regional \nconnectivity, especially for landlocked Bhutan and Nepal, and the northeast region of India. \nThese obstacles are worsened by the lack of cross-border transit agreements, resulting in \nmultiple border transshipments. In addition, land border crossings have inadequate facilities for \nwarehousing,  handling,  scanning,  and  testing.10 These  are  serious  trade  impediments,  as \nalmost all intraregional trade is by land.11 ADB is seeking to bridge the infrastructure gaps \nthrough ongoing and upcoming transport projects.12 Compounding the gaps are three sets of \nNTBs: \n (i)  Time-intensive processing and high degree of inspection. Recent studies \nsuggest that while infrastructure constraints are important, the \u201csoft bottlenecks\u201d \nof  administrative  and  technical  barriers  are  \u201cthe  primary  problem\u201d. 13  The \ndominant approach in the subregion combines heavy and intensive physical and \ndocumentary controls. This increases operating costs and is highly inefficient.  \n                                                 \n9  LPI measures how efficiently trade is being moved. It is based on a worldwide survey of operators (global freight \nforwarders and express carriers) providing feedback on the logistics \u201cfriendliness\u201d of the countries in which they \noperate. The LPI has a maximum score of 5.0. Country scores are obtained by computing and averaging \nresponses from a questionnaire filled by 1,000 logistics professionals. The World Bank suggests the following \nclassification for logistics performance in the country: (i) if score < 2.35: logistics unfriendly; (ii) if 2.35 < score < \n2.85: partial performance of logistics service providers; (iii) if 2.85 < score < 3.35: consistent performance of \nlogistics service providers; and (iv) if score > 3.35: logistics friendly. \nSee LPI website at http://info.worldbank.org/etools/tradesurvey/mode1b.asp.  \n10  The lack, or poor state, of testing facilities constitutes technical barriers to trade. This includes the lack of \ninternational accreditation of product certifications originating from Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal.  \n11  There are also constraints arising from security concerns. The porous nature of borders between Bangladesh and \nIndia and between Nepal and India are perceived to be conducive to insurgency, smuggling, and illegal migration, \nwhich foster the creation of NTBs, such as 100% physical examinations and compulsory transshipment. \n12 ADB. 2010.

See also footnote 13. \n13 See Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Arvis, Robin Carruthers, Graham Smith, and Christopher Willoughby. 2011. Connecting \nLandlocked Developing Countries to Markets: Trade Corridors in the 21st Century. Washington, DC. (p. 29). \n ", "4 \n(ii)  Cumbersome paperwork and limited automation. There is a high level of \npaperwork and time-consuming procedures at SASEC borders. Multiple copies of \ndocuments are required, and many approvals from several national and local \ngovernment agencies, which necessitates the use of clearing and forwarding \nagents acting as \u201ccouriers\u201d. Moreover, the customs management systems of \nSASEC countries (with partial exception of India) are generally not used as a \nprocessing tool but as a transaction database. Manual and automated systems \noperate in parallel, thus increasing rather than decreasing traders\u2019 costs. \n(iii)  Lack of information and transparency in trade. The high level of informal \ntrade in the subregion suggests that there are strong incentives for traders to \nbypass rules and regulations. Such action is fostered by a lack of transparency \nand accountability, partly due to the private sector\u2019s lack of access to information \nand channels for communication. This situation leads to governance risks, deters \nlegitimate trade, and increases transaction costs.  \n \n9.  India\u2019s leading role. As the dominant actor in subregional trade, India has taken a \nleading role in SASEC through its chairing of the last two SASEC TFTWG meetings in Bangkok \nin October 2011 and in Kolkata in March 2012. In Nepal, India accounts for 58% of exports and \n59%  of  imports.  In  Bhutan,  India  accounts  for  93%  of  exports  and  77%  of  imports.  For \nBangladesh, the challenge is increasing the volume of trade. India accounts for only 1.7% of \nBangladesh\u2019s  exports  and  11.3%  of  its  imports.14 In  support  of  subregional  trade,  the \nGovernment of India, through its integrated check posts project, is upgrading 13 land ports \nalong  the  border  with  Bangladesh,  Myanmar,  Nepal,  and  Pakistan,  which  is  expected  to \nincrease cross-border movements of passengers and goods.  \n \n10.  Strategic and coordinated approach of the program. Due to its limited resources, the \nprogram will be highly selective and strategic. A program modality is proposed in view of the \npolicy  reforms  required  to  dismantle  NTBs.  Working  closely  with  the  World  Customs \nOrganization  (WCO),  the  program  is  supporting  the  aspirations  of  SASEC  to  meet  global \nstandards and performance benchmarks.15 Moreover, given the complexity of issues and, in the \ncase of Nepal, multiplicity of donor initiatives, the program will be processed in coordination with \nother ADB divisions and other development partners. Notably, the program is being coordinated \nwith  the  Transport  and  Communications  Division  (SATC),  which  is  processing  transport \nprojects,  and  with  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Coordination  Division  (SARC),  which  is \nimplementing  TA  projects  for  regional  cooperation  and  trade  facilitation.  The  Public \nManagement, Financial Sector and Trade Division, SARC, and SATC conducted a joint trade \nfacilitation and transport mission in March 2012. In September 2012, the WCO joined ADB in \nfact-finding missions to Bangladesh and Bhutan. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The impact of the program will be increased trade, including intraregional trade, of \nSASEC countries. The outcome will be more efficient, transparent, secure and service-oriented \nprocessing of cross-border trade of SASEC countries. The outputs will be (i) modern and \neffective customs administration and/or management; (ii) streamlined and transparent trade \nprocesses and procedures; and (iii) improved services and information for private sector traders \nand investors, including women entrepreneurs. \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2007.

Manila (TA 6435-REG). \n15 ADB and the WCO signed a memorandum of understanding in May 2010 on cooperation and assistance. \n ", "5 \nC.  Outputs \n12.  Output 1: Modern and effective customs administration and/or management. To \nreduce time-intensive procedures and high levels of inspection, the program will assist the three \nSASEC countries in transforming their customs agencies to become more modern agencies. \nSpecifically, it will assist Bhutan and Nepal to accede and comply with the Revised Kyoto \nConvention (RKC).16 RKC standards are associated with faster release of goods, reduced trade \ncosts, increased revenues, higher foreign direct investments, and economic competitiveness.17 \nIn  Bhutan,  the  program  will  support  the  conduct  of  a  gap  analysis  with  respect  to  RKC \naccession and the implementation of reforms to close the gaps. In Nepal, the program will help \nsupport accession, which is part of the government\u2019s Customs Reform and Modernization Plan. \n \n13.  The program will also assist Bangladesh implement the WCO's Framework of Standards \nto  Secure  and  Facilitate  Global  Trade  (SAFE),  which  to  date  is  unevenly  applied  in  the \nsubregion.18 As  appropriate,  the  program  will  also  support  Bhutan  and  Nepal  with  SAFE \nFramework implementation. SAFE measures help boost the security of the international supply \nchain and foster and protect legitimate trade. By supporting RKC accession and SAFE adoption, \nthe program seeks to create a convergence of capacities for stronger SASEC trade. \n \n14.  Output 2: Streamlined and transparent trade processes and procedures. To reduce \nthe excessive paperwork and increase automation, the program will assist SASEC countries in \nupdating  their  customs  management  systems  and  establishing  a  national  singe  window \n(NSW).19 The  leading  automated  system  for  managing  customs  data  is  ASYCUDA  World \ndeveloped by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.20 The adoption of \nASYCUDA World or ASYCUDA-compatible systems\u2014combined with NSW\u2014will result in lower \ncosts  and  fewer  delays  due  to  efficient  transactions,  greater  harmonization  of  forms,  and \nelectronic exchange of information between customs administrations.  \n \n15.  All  three  participating  countries  have  invested  in  automated  customs  management \nsystems. Bangladesh is in the process of upgrading to ASYCUDA World. Bhutan\u2019s system is \nexpected to be replaced by the customs component of a revenue administration management \ninformation system.21 Nepal has secured financing from ADB to upgrade to ASYCUDA World \nbut  has  since  requested  program  assistance  to  review  the  suitability  of  upgrading  versus \ndeveloping a bespoke system.22 In addition, through the program, ADB will support Nepal in the \nimplementation of its e-customs master plan. All SASEC countries have expressed interest in \nNSW implementation.23 As a group, SASEC could consider the path taken by the Association of \n                                                 \n16 In September 2012, Bangladesh acceded to the RKC, thus complying with a key policy action for the disbursement \nof its 1st tranche under the program. The RKC, or the International Convention on the Simplification and \nHarmonization of Customs Procedures, came into force in 1999 and represents the most widely accepted blueprint \nfor modern customs operations.

The  program  will  assist  the  three  SASEC \ncountries in implementing reforms to provide better services and information to importers and \nexporters. For traders, besides lacking information on regulations,25 the biggest difficulties are \nassessing potential markets and accessing finance.26 The program will thus support the creation \nof a trade portal in Bangladesh and will help establish national trade facilitation committees that \ncan help pinpoint NTBs, develop feasible alternatives, and assist in their implementation.27  \n \nD.

The respective governments will shoulder the balance of the costs for their \ncountries. The proceeds of the loans and grants will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nSimplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans.29 \nThere will be two tranches per country\u2014the first upon loan and grant effectiveness, the second \n18  months  later  upon  verified  compliance  of  second-tranche  actions.  Each  country\u2019s \ndisbursements are linked to specific policy actions, and are not cross-conditional to the policy \nactions of other countries.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The executing agencies of the program will be the National Board of Revenue (NBR) in \nBangladesh, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) in Bhutan, and the Department of Customs (DOC) in \nNepal. In Bangladesh, the implementing agencies will be the NBR, the Ministry of Commerce, \nand the Ministry of Shipping. In Bhutan, the implementing agency will be the Department of \nRevenue and Customs. In Nepal, the implementing agencies will be DOC and the Ministry of \nCommerce and Supplies. To manage the implementation of the program in each country, a \nprogram steering committee (PSC) and a program management unit (PMU) will be established. \nBiennial meetings of the SASEC TFTWG will ensure intercountry coordination. \n \nTable 5: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  January 2013\u2013December 2015 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2015 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight  SASEC Trade Facilitation and Transport Working Group will provide overall guidance, with \nbody  support from program steering committee in each country. \n(ii)  Executing  Bangladesh: National Board of Revenue \nagency  Bhutan:  Ministry of Finance \nNepal: Department of Customs \n(iii) Key  Bangladesh: National Board of Revenue, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Shipping \nimplementing  Bhutan: Department of Revenue and Customs \nagencies  Nepal: Department of Customs and Ministry of Commerce and Supplies \nDisbursement   The total of $47.67 million in Asian Development Fund loans and grants is divided as \nfollows: Bangladesh $21 million (loan), Bhutan $11.67 million ($8.34 million loan, $3.33 \nmillion grant), and Nepal $15 million (grant).

The PMUs will submit quarterly reports to the PSC and their work plans may be \nrevised as needed to improve effectiveness. \n \n22.  The program\u2019s implementation period will be 3 years, from January 2013 to December \n2015. Overall program coordination will be conducted through the SASEC TFTWG.  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n23.  Although the program does not have a linked TA, it will be supported by two TAs \nrecently approved under the Australia\u2013ADB South Asia Development Partnership Facility.30  \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n24.  The  program  has  two  highly  technical  components:  (i)  the  automation  of  customs \nmanagement systems and (ii) the establishment of NSWs (footnote 19). The mission based its \nanalysis and program recommendations on key studies. In Bangladesh, the mission drew on the \ngovernment\u2019s assessment of the requirements for upgrading to ASYCUDA World. In Bhutan, an \nADB TA conducted an as-is analysis of the existing system, followed by a to-be analysis for a \nnew  system  (footnote  21).  In  Nepal,  the  mission  drew  on  a  previous  assessment  of \nAYSCUDA++ under a separate project (footnote 12).  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n25.  The  program's  economic  and  financial  benefits  to  governments,  businesses,  and \nconsumers are (i) less time spent by traders on submitting documents as a result of online \nlodgment of declarations; (ii) less processing time spent by custom officers on each declaration, \nas greater automation increases productivity and savings in hiring additional personnel; (iii) \nshorter transit time of vehicles due to faster clearing by border authorities, which translates into \nsavings in transport costs that can be passed on to consumers; (iv) more revenue could be \ncollected through more effective targeting of undervalued and undeclared shipments through \nthe use of risk assessment systems; and (v) cheaper and better-quality goods, as standards are \nmet and distribution costs are reduced thanks to more efficient processing. Nonquantifiable \nbenefits relate to the increase in trade generated by the reduction or removal of NTBs. As the \n                                                 \n30  ADB. 2006. Establishing the Australia-ADB South Asia Development Partnership Facility. Manila. The first TA is \nthe SASEC Transport and Trade Facilitation Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening. With a budget of \n$1,175,000, the TA will support program implementation in key areas, e.g., gap analyses for accession to the RKC \nand adoption of SAFE Framework; regulatory impact analyses; and assessments for NSWs. The second TA is \nAssessing Gender Dimensions in Regional Cooperation and Integration in South Asia. With a budget of $500,000, \nit will conduct policy-oriented research on increasing women\u2019s participation in intraregional trade, promote safe \nlabor migration, and mitigate risks of cross-border movements of goods and people. Other TA will be developed in \n2013 to further assist program implementation, e.g., study visits to the Greater Mekong Subregion and Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation programs. For Nepal, additional TA support could include drafting a business plan \nfor the Customs Reform and Modernization Action Plan (2013\u20132017) and devising an e-desk of client services. \n ", "9 \ntrading environment becomes more efficient and transparent, the incentives for illicit trade will \nweaken, while the use of legitimate channels will increase and thus generate further revenue.31 \n \nC.   Governance \n \n26.   The mission drew on risk assessments of the three countries conducted in line with \nADB's Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.32 Risks related to public financial \nmanagement  (PFM),  corruption,  and  procurement  are  described  in  each  country\u2019s  risk \nassessment.33 Among the common risks are high opportunities for corruption due to numerous \nface-to-face transactions of border agencies with traders. This is compounded by the agencies\u2019 \nhighly  manual  procedures  in  their  internal  operations  and  frontline  transactions,  which  are \ncharacterized by limited internal controls. To highlight the need to address the issues, the \nmission discussed with counterparts ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date). \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n27.   The impact of the program on poverty and social factors will be indirect and gradual. \nThe following groups will be affected: (i) government agencies involved in trade; (ii) importers \nand exporters, including women entrepreneurs; (iii) local businesses; (iv) workers, including \nwomen  workers,  in  export-oriented  enterprises;  (v)  informal  traders;  and  (vi)  clearing  and \nforwarding agents. Some officials may resist automation and process reengineering for fear of \nbecoming  redundant  or  because  more  transparency  will  reduce  their  discretionary  power. \nImporters and exporters, including women entrepreneurs, are winners since the reforms will \nreduce their cost of doing business. Local businesses selling domestic goods may fear greater \ncompetition as a result of more imports. Workers in export-oriented enterprises will experience a \nboon as exports are expected to increase due to reforms. Effects on informal traders will be \nmixed\u2014smaller ones will not be affected, larger ones will be forced to formalize trade to reduce \ncosts. Clearing and forwarding agents are likely to face less demand as their business model \nrelies on cumbersome procedures. In sum, over the medium term, the removal of NTBs will spur \neconomic growth, reduce poverty, and create jobs with better labor safeguards. \n \nE.   Safeguards  \n \n28.  The program\u2019s reforms do not involve physical construction, and an adverse impact on \nthe environment, involuntary resettlement, or indigenous peoples is unlikely. The program is \nthus classified as category C in all three of ADB\u2019s safeguard areas.  \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n29.  The program\u2019s support for key trade facilitation reforms have risk mitigating dimensions. \nThe enhancement of customs management systems will help strengthen internal controls. The \nestablishment of NSW will compel reduction of paperwork and simplify procedures, and hence \nwill  reduce  corruption  opportunities.  The  activation  of  trade  facilitation  committees  will \nstrengthen private sector participation and introduce more transparency in trade processes. \nFurthermore, in Bangladesh, ADB is providing a TA to improve procurement, accounting and \nauditing34 as well as supporting the Strengthening Good Governance Program, which recently \n                                                 \n31 Economic and Financial Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 ADB. 2006.

ASSURANCES \n30.  The respective governments and finance ministries of the three countries have assured \nADB that the implementation of the program shall conform to all applicable ADB policies, \nincluding  those  concerning  anticorruption,  safeguards,  gender,  procurement,  consulting \nservices, and disbursement, as described in the and loan and grant documents. \n \nVI.
