Natural disasters causing 1.2 million tons shortfall in rice \nproduction  adversely  affected  the  food  security  of  25  million \npeople. Soaring food prices, driven by rising international prices, \ncompounded  the  food  insecurity  of  millions  of  people.  An \nadditional 12 million people have fallen below the poverty line \nfollowing the surge in food prices. \n \nThe  Project  will  improve  the  food  security  of  the  poor  and \nvulnerable people in the face of rising food prices. It will provide \nshort-term  transitional  support  to  help  the  Government  meet \nunexpected high expenditures for safety net programs based on \nthe needs assessment conducted jointly with the Japan Bank for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) and World Bank with the support \nof the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n(FAO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), United States Agency \nfor  International  Development  (USAID),  and  World  Food \nProgramme (WFP).   \n \nThe major outputs of the Project are the following:  \n \n(i)    Output 1:  Strengthened open market sales of food grains, \nwith wider coverage to ensure food security for 1.1 million \nperson-months of targeted poor and vulnerable people.  \n \n(ii)    Output  2:  Enhanced  food  entitlements  for  5.4  million \nperson-months  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable  to  survive \nshort-term food deficits.  \n \n(iii)    Output 3: Enhanced purchasing power of the poor and \nvulnerable by generating rural employment for 1 million \nperson-months.  \n \n(iv)  Output  4:  A  more  effective  and  efficient  food  security \nmonitoring system.  \n   \n ", "ii \nRationale  The surge in prices of food grains has eroded the purchasing \npower of the poor and vulnerable, placing them at great risk of \nhunger and malnutrition. Soaring food prices are undermining the \ngains in poverty reduction and have pushed large numbers of \npeople  back  below  the  poverty  line.  An  additional  8.5%  of \nhouseholds  have  fallen  below  the  poverty  line  in  2008\u2014this \ntranslates into an additional 2.5 million households or 12 million \npeople.  People  below  the  poverty  line  experienced  income \nerosion of 36.7% from January 2007 to March 2008 because of \nhigher food prices. In light of these risks, the Government needs \nto  strengthen  safety  net  programs  immediately  for  the  most \nvulnerable population to cope with the drastic rise in their food \nbills.  The  proposed  support  is  an  integral  part  of  the  overall \ncommitment made by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in May \n2008  to  provide  urgent  budgetary  support  to  the  hardest  hit \ncountries for safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable in the \nface of rising food prices. Those most vulnerable to food price \nshocks need to be protected from nutritional deprivation, erosion \nin their real purchasing power, and asset shedding. Failure to \nprotect the poor from income erosion could seriously undermine \nrecent  gains  in  poverty  reduction  and  the  political  and \nmacroeconomic stability of the country.  \n \nThe  overall  policy  and  institutional  environment  is  sound.  The \nGovernment  has  taken  bold  actions  to  reduce  subsidies  by \nsubstantially  raising  fertilizer  and  energy  prices,  with  freed \nresources exclusively targeting the poor and vulnerable through \nstrengthened safety net programs. The Government has a good \nrecord of managing public food distribution through well-targeted \nand  well-managed  programs,  so  there  is  a  solid  basis  for \nsupporting the envisaged safety net programs. The food for work \nprogram  also  supports  the  construction  and  maintenance  of \nessential  infrastructure\u2014rural  roads,  river  embankments, \nirrigation, and other public facilities. Only short-term solutions will \nbe  covered  by  the  emergency  loan.  Medium-  and  longer-term \nmeasures to ensure food security through increased agriculture \nproductivity will be covered under the regular country operational \nprogram in support of the national food policy and the plan of \naction for its implementation. \n   \nImpact and Outcome  The main impact of the Project will be to prevent poverty from \nrising. The Project will improve the food security of the poor and \nvulnerable  people  affected  by  repeated  natural  disasters  and \nrising  food  prices.  It  will  contribute  to  the  efforts  of  the \nGovernment so that 5 million poor and vulnerable people have \nbetter access to food. It will reduce the poverty levels of low-\nincome groups. The focus of the Project will be on improving \naccess of the poor to food, income, and livelihood support. It will \nassist in relieving the immediate fiscal pressures caused by a \nsharp  rise  in  safety  net  expenditures.  It  will  also  assist  in \nsustaining  the  external  balance,  aggravated  by  higher  import \ncosts for food grains.   \n ", "iii \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $1,293 million. \n   \nFinancing Plan  The Government has already diverted significant resources from \nits general development priorities to meet the increasing social \nsafety net requirements. In light of adverse fiscal performance, the \nGovernment has requested ADB to provide a concessional loan \nequivalent to Special Drawing Rights 104,247,000 (equivalent to \n$170 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance \nthe Project. The loan will have a 32-year term including a grace \nperiod of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. \n  \nThe World Bank is preparing parallel financing of the Project (in \nan amount preliminarily estimated at $100 million) based on the \njoint needs assessment. JBIC and the Islamic Development Bank \nare also considering the possibility of cofinancing the Project with \nADB.  If  all  the  sources  of  external  funding  materialize,  the \nGovernment will be able to recoup a portion of the safety net \nexpenditures.  Following  the  ongoing  National  Food  Policy \nCapacity  Strengthening  Program,  implemented  by  FAO  and \nfunded by the European Commission (EC) and USAID, further \nassistance is under consideration by EC and USAID for about \n$5 million  each  for  food  policy  implementation  and  monitoring, \ncomplementary to ADB assistance.  \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  31 December 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Finance Division, Ministry of Finance  \n   \nImplementation  The  Executing  Agency  will  provide  funds  to  the  Implementing \nArrangements  Agency,  the  Ministry  of  Food  and  Disaster  Management \n(MoFDM). Overall project coordination will be provided by a food \nsecurity steering committee (FSSC), chaired by the secretary of \nthe Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance. The FSSC will \ninclude representatives at joint secretary level from the Economic \nRelations  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of \nAgriculture  (MOA),  MoFDM,  Planning  Commission,  and \nDirectorate of Food and Directorate of Relief and Rehabilitation of \nMoFDM.  The  FSSC  will  be  responsible  for  implementing  the \npolicy and governance issues addressed by the Project.   \n \nTo ensure timely implementation of the Project, ADB will delegate \nresponsibility for ADB\u2019s project administration to its Bangladesh \nResident  Mission,  which  has  extensive  experience  in \nadministering similar projects. The resident mission will closely \nmonitor compliance with ADB\u2019s requirements under the Project to \nensure  quality  control  and  accelerated  implementation  through \n ", "iv \nclose  follow-up  and  guidance  to  the  relevant  ministries  and \nagencies on project implementation matters.  \n   \nProcurement  The Project will provide $170 million to meet the Government\u2019s \nurgent  additional  financing  requirements  for  food  security.  In \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance \nPolicy, the financing will only be used for expenditures of goods \nidentified to implement the Government\u2019s safety net programs and \nprocured  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines \n(2007, as amended from time to time). ADB Management has \nagreed to provide retroactive financing for a maximum 30% of the \ntotal loan amount for eligible expenditures incurred not earlier than \n1 April 2008, provided that the expenditures are in accordance \nwith agreed procedures, are certified by the Finance Division, and \nthe certification is acceptable to ADB. ADB will reserve the right to \naudit the use of the loan proceeds and verify the accuracy of the \nGovernment\u2019s certification. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will provide emergency assistance to the Government \nBeneficiaries  to  expand  targeted  safety  net  programs  for  the  poor  and \nvulnerable  at  a  time  when  there  are  inadequate  budgetary \nresources for financing these programs. The Project will assist in \nsustaining  domestic  and  external  balances,  affected  by \nheightened  international  prices  of  food  grains  and  other \ncommodities. The assistance will foster macroeconomic stability \nby reducing the need for domestic borrowing, thus dampening \ninflationary pressures and avoiding the crowding out of domestic \ninvestment. Fiscal space will be created, making it possible to \nreallocate resources to other essential public expenditures. The \nProject will help restore the purchasing power of the poor and \nvulnerable who are at a greater risk of hunger and malnutrition. \nThose most vulnerable to food price shocks will be protected from \nnutritional deprivation, erosion in real income, and asset shedding. \nThe  Project  will  benefit  the  poor\u2014including  men,  women,  and \nchildren\u2014by enhancing their access to food, livelihood support, \nand employment.  \n   \nRisks   Because of the huge volume of emergency food to be distributed, \nthere  are  some  risks  in  the  areas  of  storage  and  distribution, \nleakages,  and  lack  of  financial  accountability  in  safety  net \nprograms. Over time, Bangladesh has developed good capacity \nand long experience in managing public food grain distribution, \nand has strengthened the safeguards necessary to implement the \nsafety  net  and  public  food  distribution  programs  and  systems \neffectively.  Recent  measures,  such  as  the  establishment  of  a \nworking group with donor participation to monitor the public food \nprograms,  will  also  mitigate  these  risks.  The  Project  and \nassociated technical assistance (TA) include fiduciary oversight of \nthe components of the funds provided and disbursed for safety net \nspending. Another risk is the recurrence of natural disasters and \nrelated  extensive  damage,  which  would  strain  the  country\u2019s \n ", "v \nadministrative capacity in distributing food and other essentials \nand  exert  fresh  pressures  on  the  budget,  involving  additional \nimport  of  these  items.  This  risk  is  addressed  by  adopting \nappropriate  mitigation  and  cost-effective  adaptation  measures \nagainst floods and cyclones, including capacity building, which \nwould reduce damage from future disasters.  \n   \nTechnical Assistance  TA of $600,000 for Strengthening the Government\u2019s Institutional \nCapacity for Improving Food Security will be provided to support \nreform measures and fiduciary oversight supported by the Project, \ncomplementing  ongoing  and  planned  TA  support  by  EC  and \nUSAID for food policy implementation and monitoring. The TA \nproject aims to assist in improving the Government\u2019s capacity for \nplanning  and  undertaking  mid-  and  long-term  interventions  to \nimprove  food  security,  including  strengthening    monitoring  for \nincreasing the efficiency of ongoing safety net programs.   \n \n ", "", " \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  Bangladesh  for  the  Emergency  Assistance  for  Food  Security \nProject. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening the \nGovernment\u2019s Institutional Capacity for Improving Food Security, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The world is witnessing a drastic rise in food prices. Soaring food prices have led to \nserious hardship for poor and vulnerable people who spend a substantial part of their incomes \non food. Food prices in international and domestic markets have reached all-time highs. Over \nthe past year, the price of rice in the international market has risen by 196% (from $325 per ton \nin May 2007 to $963 per ton in May 2008).1 Wheat prices in the international market have risen \nby 72% (from $203 per ton in May 2007 to $349 per ton in May 2008). In Bangladesh, the retail \nprice of coarse rice has risen by 61% to Tk32.1 per kilogram (kg) in April 2008 from Tk19.9/kg in \nApril 2007, while the price of wheat has increased by 56% to Tk30.6/kg from Tk19.6/kg over the \nsame period. Despite harvest of a bumper boro rice crop (estimated at 17 million tons), the retail \nprice  of  coarse  rice  further  increased  to  Tk33.4/kg  in  early  July  2008  following  upward \nadjustments in domestic energy and fertilizer prices (Appendix 2). The prices of all other major \nfood commodities have surged in the international and domestic markets.  \n \n3.  Falling stocks, increased demand, high energy and fertilizer prices, steep depreciation of \nthe dollar, and trade restrictions imposed by some countries have amplified the price surge in \nfood grains. In the face of a shortfall in production, attempts to build stocks have heightened \nprice pressures. Although some of the cyclical factors, such as weather-related impacts, are \nlikely to fade, strong structural factors are pushing up food prices and these have some mutually \nreinforcing effects. Structural factors are much more prominent in explaining the rise in food \ngrain prices. Over the past decades, growth in the production of food grains has failed to keep \npace with growth in consumption, contributing to dwindling global food grain stocks. Growth in \nyields has slowed significantly. The surge in energy prices, driven by structural factors\u2014with the \nresultant rise in prices of fertilizers, irrigation pumps, and transportation costs\u2014has fed into the \nproduction cost, raising food grain prices further. Rapid urbanization and competing demand for \nland for commercial rather than agriculture purposes, and growing scarcity of fresh water for \nagriculture, have adversely affected production growth. The diversion of cereal use from food to \nproduce biofuel has also contributed to the food crisis. Rising income in emerging countries has \nsteadily increased demand for food grain consumption. With higher income, the demand for \nmeat and dairy products has increased. Production of meat and dairy products requires large \namounts of grain for livestock feed. In many countries, policy inadequacies, weak institutions, \nand lack of needed investment have inhibited the growth in agriculture production.  \n \n4.  Food  grain  prices  are  expected  to  moderate  somewhat  eventually  because  of  the \nincreased supply response of farmers. However, the structural factors are likely to dominate \ncyclical  factors\u2014causing  high  prices  to  persist  for  the  foreseeable  future.  Although  the \ninternational prices of many agricultural commodities have started to fall, they are unlikely to fall \n                                                 \n1   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). 2008. FAO database. Available: www.fao.org. \n ", "2 \nsignificantly because of several reasons, including the higher cost of inputs.2 A number of \ndemand factors, such as the need to replenish stocks and expected increases in utilization, are \nkeeping  prices  high  despite  a  favorable  global  production  outlook.  The  most  influential \ndevelopment  in  pushing  up  international  prices  of  basic  foods  has  been  the  low  level  of \nexportable supplies, resulting from utilization outstripping production for several crops in a \nnumber of major exporting countries. Rising utilization levels would necessitate more than one \ngood season to bring about a needed replenishment of stocks and hence a reduction in price \nvolatility.   \n \n5.  The surge in prices of food grains especially that of rice, has become a matter of serious \nconcern  for  net  food  grain  importing  countries,  such  as,  Bangladesh.  The  erosion  of  the \npurchasing  power  of  the  poor  and  vulnerable  places  them  at  greater  risk  of  hunger  and \nmalnutrition. Soaring food prices are undermining the gains in poverty reduction and could push \nlarge numbers of people back below the poverty line. The Government needs to strengthen \nsafety net programs for the most vulnerable population to cope with the drastic rise in their food \nbills.  Those  most  vulnerable  to  food  price  shocks  need  to  be  protected  from  nutritional \ndeprivation, erosion in their real purchasing power, and asset shedding. Failure to protect the \npoor from income erosion could seriously undermine recent gains in poverty reduction and the \npolitical and macroeconomic stability of the country before the general elections scheduled in \nDecember 2008.  \n \n6.  The overall policy and institutional environment is sound. The Government has taken \nbold actions to reduce subsidies by substantially raising fertilizer and energy prices, with freed \nresources  exclusively  targeting  the  poor  and  vulnerable  through  strengthened  safety  net \nprograms. The Government has a good record of managing public food distribution through \nwell-targeted and well-managed programs, so there is a solid basis for supporting the envisaged \nsafety  net  programs.  The  food  for  work  program  also  supports  the  construction  and \nmaintenance of essential infrastructure\u2014rural roads, river embankments, irrigation, and other \npublic facilities. \n  \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n \n1.  Food Price Shocks \n  \n7.  In Bangladesh, a net food importing country, domestic food grain production, public and \nprivate stocks, and international trade determine food grain availability. Bangladesh has been \nseriously affected by food price shocks, driven by soaring international prices and domestic \nproduction shortfall following successive natural disasters. Surging food prices have hit the poor \nand food-insecure households the hardest. The net food buyers3 in rural Bangladesh and fixed \nincome groups in urban areas (including urban slum dwellers)\u2014which represent the majority of \npoor households\u2014are adversely affected. Adjustments in the rural economy, which can create \nnew income opportunities, would take time to reach the poor. The nutrition of the poor is also at \nrisk when they are not insulated from price rises. Higher food prices lead poor people to limit \ntheir  food  consumption  and  shift  to  less  balanced  diets,  causing  widespread  nutritional \ndeprivation. \n \n8.  Bangladesh is still a least developed country with per capita gross domestic product \n(GDP) of $554 in FY2008. However, over the past three decades, it has achieved near self-\n                                                 \n2   FAO. 2008. Food Outlook.  Available: www.fao.org. \n3    Rural households who buy more food than they sell.  \n ", "3 \nsufficiency in rice production from a chronic food deficit. The significant rise in rice production is \ndue  to  policy  improvement,  which  induced  significant  increases  in  irrigated  areas.  Since \nFY2000, annual food grain production in the country rose by 2.9% or 0.7 million tons. Per capita \nfood grain production has grown at the comfortable rate of 1.3% per year and availability has \nrisen  by  2%  annually.  Food  security  remains  elusive,  though,  particularly  in  years  when \nproduction is affected by natural disasters. The devastating floods during July\u2013September 2007 \nand a cyclone during 15\u201316 November 2007, affecting 25 million people in 51 districts, caused \nsevere damage to agriculture, livelihoods, and infrastructure. The combined losses of the floods \nand cyclone are estimated at $2.8 billion or 3.6% of GDP. The severe flooding and cyclone \nseriously affected the aman rice crop; production is estimated at 9.7 million tons in FY2008, \nwhich is 1.2 million tons lower than the preceding year. Although larger imports in FY2008 \nhelped offset the food grain production shortfall, prices in the domestic market soared because \nof rising international prices and seasonality reinforced by the floods and cyclone. The market \nsurplus of available food grains4 is estimated at 3.9 million tons in FY2008, higher than in recent \nyears (Appendix 2). However, availability of food in aggregate terms does not guarantee food \nsecurity for all at the current level of prices\u2014especially not for the poor and vulnerable.  \n \n9.  The Government discontinued administrative actions, such as anti-hoarding measures \nthat failed to arrest upward trends in prices. The domestic cost of rice production has increased, \neven with subsidized agriculture inputs such as diesel and urea fertilizer. Responding to market \nsignals, driven by soaring international and domestic prices, the Government fixed the boro rice \nprocurement price at Tk28/kg, 56% higher than the last boro season. Boro procurement runs \nfrom 16 April to 31 August 2008. Even after a bumper boro crop, rice prices did not moderate, \nimplying that high food prices are likely to persist in the foreseeable future. Despite a bumper \nboro crop, a supply shortage is possible if the next aman or boro crops are affected by natural \ndisasters or other factors. Considering such risks, the Government is planning to raise the \nstocks under the public food distribution system (PFDS) to 1 million tons by the end of June \n2009 (from 0.6 million tons at the end of June 2008) through domestic procurement and imports \nfor distribution to priced and non-priced safety net programs for the poor and vulnerable. The \nboro  procurement  target  of  the  current  season  is  about  1.2  million  tons  (in  terms  of  rice \nequivalent), which is about 50% higher than average boro procurement in the last 5 years and \n7% of expected boro rice production of the current fiscal year. The budgetary implication for this \nprocurement is $490 million. For the operation of the PFDS, public commercial imports in \nFY2009 are expected to rise to 1.3 million tons or $620 million from an estimated 0.7 million \ntons or $290 million in FY2008 (Appendix 3). The readily available and useable storage capacity \nin the public food grain distribution system is 1.2 million tons, unable to accommodate peak time \nstorage demands. The Government is planning to expand the storage capacity in the PFDS with \na focus on public-private partnership in building and maintaining food grain storage.  \n \n2.  Poverty and Macroeconomic Impacts  \n \n10.  Repeated natural disasters and soaring food prices seriously affected Bangladesh, with \nsignificant poverty and macroeconomic implications. Impacts of the rise of food prices on the \nhousehold  incomes  and  key  macroeconomic  variables  are  assessed  using  a  computable \n                                                 \n4   Market food grains availability in Bangladesh may be defined as follows: \n  FA=NP+OT+PI-DP \nwhere  FA  =  market  food  grains  availability;  NP  =  net  production  (0.9  \u00d7  domestic  gross  production);  \nOT = government off-take; PI = private imports; and DP = government domestic procurement. This definition \nincludes stocks held by private traders that may not reflect immediate availability for consumption. Data on \nprivate food grain stocks are not available.    \n ", "4 \ngeneral  equilibrium  model. 5  The  model  is  calibrated  to  a  social  accounting  matrix  for \nBangladesh for 2005. Two simulations are carried out: one for a 20% rise in the price of food \nitems, and the other for a 60% rise. A rise in food price transmits to the domestic economy by \naffecting general prices, real wages, aggregate demand, supply, and real income. The results \nshow that the inflation is highly sensitive to a rise in food prices; and a rise in food prices causes \na decline in real household income, household welfare, and real GDP (Table 1). \n \nTable 1: Impact of Food Price Rise \n \nItem  Simulation of 60% Rise  Simulation of 20% Rise \nGeneral Price Level  2.16 percentage points  0.59 percentage points \nReal Household Income   \u20131.612  \u20130.501 \nWelfare (equivalent variation)  \u20130.905  \u20130.314 \nReal GDP  \u20130.787 percentage points  \u20130.231 percentage points \nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: South Asian Network on Economic Modeling, Dhaka Secretariat. \n \n11.  Poverty Impact. The surge in prices of food, mainly rice, has seriously eroded the \npurchasing capacity of people living below the poverty line as well as government employees, \nindustrial workers, and others with fixed incomes. Rice contributes to 71% of the total calorie \nintake/person/day in rural Bangladesh and 60% in urban areas.6 Food accounts for 69% of total \nexpenditures for the poorest 30%. Both urban and rural households in Bangladesh face welfare \nlosses in the short term, even with a 10% increase in the price of rice.7 The losses are higher in \nthe lower quintiles. Households in the poorest rural quintile earn on average 63% of their \nincome from on- and off-farm wages. The majority of the rural households are net food buyers; \nonly 12% are net food sellers. These characteristics show that the poorest households are \nhighly vulnerable to food price increases and experience large welfare losses. Marginal farmers \nand sharecroppers did not get their due share of the price rise because many of them sold their \ncrops to the landowners at a lower price before the harvest. \n \n12.  High food inflation has two important implications for the poor. First, it increases the \nprice of food relative to that of non-food items. Since a higher proportion of the consumption \nbasket of the poor in Bangladesh is allocated to food items, the poor have serious difficulty in \nallocating funds in response to food price shocks. Therefore, the poor bear almost the full brunt \nof food inflation. Second, since food inflation reduces the real income of the poor, there is less \nmoney left after food purchases to consume other necessary goods and services such as \neducation, health, water, sanitation, and energy. In other words, the income effect hurts the poor \nmore.  \n  \n13.  In Bangladesh, where about 40% of population is under the upper poverty line and 25% \nis below the lower poverty line,8 a 50% rise in rice prices would reduce the intake of the hard-\ncore poor significantly\u2014close to a starvation diet. According to the preliminary findings of a \nrecent study,9 considering the weighted inflationary impact of price of rice, an additional 8.5% of \n                                                 \n5   Developed and maintained by the South Asian Network on Economic Modeling, Dhaka Secretariat. \n6   Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics. 2005.

The  World  Bank  is  currently  preparing  a  poverty  assessment  for  Bangladesh  which  will  include \ncomprehensive analysis of impact of recent rise in food prices on poverty.  \n ", "5 \nhouseholds have fallen below the poverty line in 2008. This translates into an additional 2.5 \nmillion households or 12 million people falling below the poverty line. The study also reveals that \nthe  heightened  inflation,  particularly  soaring  food  prices,  seriously  affected  the  poor  and \nvulnerable and fixed income earners. People below the poverty line experienced income erosion \nof 36.7% from January 2007 to March 2008.  \n  \n14.  Macroeconomic Impact. The immediate effect of rising food prices is on inflation, fiscal \noutlays, and external balance. The surge in food prices (58.8% weight in the consumer price \nindex) is pushing inflation higher. Consumer price index inflation rose to 10% on an annual \nbasis in March 2008, up from 7% in March 2007. During this period, food inflation rose to 11.8% \nfrom 8%. For FY2008, the fiscal implications of the Government\u2019s response to food price shocks \nand natural disasters are sizeable (e.g., food safety net spending of $0.69 billion or 0.9% of \nGDP) and subsidies on fertilizer ($0.50 billion or 0.6% of GDP) and energy ($0.84 billion or \n1.1% of GDP). The fiscal deficit in FY2008 is estimated at 4.7% of GDP (foreign financing 2.4% \nof GDP), from 3.2% of GDP (foreign financing 1.2% of GDP) in the preceding year. The fiscal \npressures will be heightened in FY2009 because of an expanded food safety net program for \nthe poor (1.5% of GDP) and a continued uptrend in international prices of fuel and fertilizers \n(Appendix 4).  \n \n15.  Considering the fiscal pressures of low administered prices of energy and fertilizers, the \nGovernment increased the price of domestic compressed natural gas by 98% at the end of April \n2008. It also increased the price of urea by 108% effective 10 June 2008, and raised fuel prices \nby 34%\u201350% effective 1 July 2008. Following these price adjustments, freed resources will \nexclusively target the poor and vulnerable through a strengthened safety net program. Although \nthese adjustments in prices of energy and fertilizers will substantially reduce subsidies, the fiscal \ndeficit is projected to rise to 4.9% of GDP in FY2009 as international prices of energy and \nfertilizer  continue  to  rise.  To  finance  the  rising  fiscal  deficit,  the Government  is  mobilizing \nadditional external assistance to avoid excessive domestic bank borrowing, which is expensive \nand inflationary and crowds out the private sector. Higher food prices significantly contributed to \na surge in the trade deficit (estimated at 6.8% of GDP in FY2008). However, the balance of \npayment impact of higher food prices has been partly offset by higher aid flows and a surge in \noverseas workers\u2019 remittances.  \n \n3.  Government\u2019s Strategy and Response to Address Food Security \n \n16.  In 2006, the Government approved the national food policy,10 which details the key \nelements of national food security initiatives through (i) adequate and stable supply of food; (ii) \npeople\u2019s increased purchasing power and access to food; and (iii) adequate nutrition for all, \nincluding women and children. The national food policy emphasizes both short-term solutions to \ncope with unexpected domestic and external shocks following natural disasters, and medium- \nand longer-term measures to ensure food security through increased agriculture productivity. \nWhile short-term responses are urgently needed to meet present food security needs in the \naftermath of the natural disasters in late 2007 and in the face of rising international prices, over \nthe medium to long term, measures are needed to ensure continued availability of food. The \nimmediate priority is to ensure food security for the poor and vulnerable. In addition, farmers\u2019 \nproduction incentives will be sustained in the immediate term. The coverage of safety net \nprograms will be expanded to those whose food security status has been affected by soaring \nprices. The Government aims to improve targeting, make delivery mechanisms more cost-\n                                                 \n10   Ministry of Food and Disaster Management. 2006.

It also plans to strengthen food stock management by involving the private sector.  \n \n17.  In the medium term, food security will be enhanced primarily through technology-driven \nproductivity improvements rather than by the provision of government subsidies. The focus will \nbe on technological improvement, boosting investment in agriculture, adoption of higher yielding \ncrop varieties, and strengthening the agro-input distribution system (quality seeds, fertilizers, \nwater  and  irrigation  costs,  credit,  etc.).  With  support  of  the  development  partners,  the \nGovernment recently developed a plan of action for implementing the national food policy with \n26 areas of intervention and 314 targeted actions (Appendix 5). The plan is expected to be \napproved within 2008 and implementation commenced. The Government is aware of the large \ninvestment  needs  in  agriculture,  particularly  the  food  grain  subsector.  It  considers  that  its \ncooperation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in the agriculture sector should prioritize \nfood crop production, seed development and agricultural research, extension, infrastructure \ndevelopment, and support services.  \n \n18.  Following successive natural disasters in the second half of 2007 and in the face of \nrising international prices, the Government responded to soaring food grain prices in several \nways, including cutting the import duty on food items, raising food grain imports, launching an \nextensive flood and cyclone recovery program, focusing on higher boro rice production, and \nwidening  social  safety  net  programs  for  the  poor  and  vulnerable.  It  banned  the  export  of \nnonaromatic varieties of rice for 6 months and negotiated to import a substantial quantity of rice \n(500,000 tons) from India. Bangladesh Bank is following a more flexible approach in exchange \nrate management to contain the pass-through of rising international prices to domestic prices. It \nis encouraging banks to provide credit facilities on softer terms to new importers, easing letter of \ncredit margins for food items, and extending the time limit for importers. The Government has \ntaken bold actions to reduce subsidies by substantially raising fertilizer and energy prices; \nresources freed from these actions exclusively fund additional safety net programs. However, it \nis not possible for the Government to address such a severe crisis from its own resources, so it \nhas requested the development partners to fund the substantial financing gap.    \n \n19.  In  response  to  the  Government\u2019s  request,  ADB,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation (JBIC) and World Bank\u2014supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization \n(FAO), International Monetary Fund (IMF), United States Agency for International Development \n(USAID) and World Food Programme (WFP)\u2014conducted the needs assessment to determine \nthe country\u2019s immediate safety net requirements, evaluate its program, and agree on areas of \nassistance  to  be  provided  by  the  development  partners  with  the  concurrence  of  the \nGovernment. ADB\u2019s emergency assistance will focus on supporting the Government\u2019s food \nsafety net programs.  \n \n4.  Needs Assessment  \n \n20.  The needs assessment mission conducted jointly with the JBIC and World Bank with the \nsupport of FAO, IMF, USAID, and WFP focused on immediate assistance measures needed by \nthe Government in the face of food price shocks. The findings of the needs assessment mission \nare as follows: \n \n(i)  Following the national food policy, the policy measures available in the short run \ninclude expanding safety net programs and social protection for the vulnerable \nand poor affected by unexpected domestic and external shocks, such as in the \naftermath of natural disasters and rising food prices. Several priced and non-\n ", "7 \npriced safety net programs under the PFDS can support the purchasing power of \nthe poor without distorting incentives for domestic food production (Appendix 6).  \n(ii)  Safety  net  programs  related  to  food  security  include  open  market  sales, \nvulnerable group development, vulnerable group feeding, test relief (food), food \nassistance, and food for work. These safety net programs are targeted on the \nbasis of low income groups and poverty concentration areas. The Government is \nplanning to strengthen these safety net programs further, with an emphasis on \ntargeting efficiency in addition to increased spending and expanded coverage, to \nprotect the poor and vulnerable from the food price shocks. The channel-wise \nfood distribution under the expanded safety net program compared to earlier \nyears is given in Appendix 7. \n(iii)  Learning  from  the  experience  of  neighboring  countries  (e.g.,  India),  the \nGovernment has introduced a new 100-day employment scheme for 8 million \nperson-months  or  2  million  beneficiaries  to  address  joblessness  in  poverty-\nstricken rural areas. The sustainability and effectiveness of the scheme will be \nreviewed by independent research agencies.  \n(iv)  The Government will need to increase safety net program spending for food \nsecurity in FY2009 to $1.29 billion or 1.45% of GDP from $0.69 billion or 0.88% \nof GDP in FY2008 (Table 2). Expanded safety net programs are needed to \nprovide income, food, and livelihood support to the poor and vulnerable for 58.41 \nmillion person-months in FY2009 from 43.70 million person-months in FY2008, \nincreasing coverage by 34%.  \n \nTable 2: Social Safety Net for Food Security \n \nCoverage \n  Amount \n(million person-\n  ($ million) \nmonths) \nSafety Net Program   \n \n \nFY2008  FY2009  FY2008  % of  FY2009  % of \n \nEstimate Budget  Estimate  GDP  Budget  GDP \n             \nOpen Market Sales  6.84  8.50  269.53  0.35  389.93  0.44 \nVulnerable Group Development  8.83  8.83  105.10  0.13  121.96  0.14 \nVulnerable Group Feeding  20.93  22.50  124.64  0.16  103.22  0.12 \nTest Relief (Food)  1.43  1.91  59.91  0.08  92.05  0.10 \nGratuitous Relief (Food)  3.20  3.20  25.36  0.03  29.36  0.03 \nFood Assistance in Chittagong \n0.71  0.71  29.74  0.04  34.68  0.04 \nHill Tracts\n \n \nFood for Work Program  1.76  4.76  73.32  0.09  229.98  0.26 \n100-Day Employment Scheme  0.00  8.00  0.00  0.00  291.55  0.33 \nTotal  43.70  58.41  687.60  0.88  1,292.73  1.45 \nFY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates based on Finance Division data. \n  \n21.  The  safety  net  programs  in  Bangladesh  have  been  evaluated  by  several  key \ndevelopment partners including International Food Policy Research Institute, WFP, and World \nBank in addition to regular monitoring and evaluation by relevant government agencies. Since \nthe early 1970s, safety net programs have had a tremendous impact on the improvement in the \n ", "8 \noverall food security and nutrition status of the poorest people in Bangladesh. These programs \nhave helped the poor and vulnerable to improve their livelihoods; health and nutrition status, \nparticularly  for  women  and  children;  and  income  generation.  Women  have  become  more \nempowered and their ability to make decisions, mobilize resources, and exercise choices over \nvarious aspects of their lives has improved. Income transfers from the safety net programs have \nalso played an important role in protecting and expanding the asset bases of the poor and \nvulnerable. The programs have made major  contributions toward reduction of the national \npoverty  level,  by  protecting  against  a  worsening  hunger  situation  and  avoiding  a  major \njoblessness  situation.  They  have  also  played  a  key  role  in  developing  and  improving  the \ncountry\u2019s infrastructure, including rural roads, flood protection, and irrigation facilities (especially \nthrough  the  construction  and  maintenance  of  embankments  and  channels  by  low-income \ncommunities). Based on recent evaluations, these programs are particularly beneficial for the \npoor and vulnerable at times of natural disasters and food insecurity. Among the different forms \nof  transfer,  the  biggest  improvement  is  in  food  security  of  the  extreme  poor.  Considering \nBangladesh\u2019s level of income and size of population, these programs are limited in scale and \ncoverage. Their efficiency, in terms of targeting and coverage, needs to be improved; and their \nadministrative capacity needs to be strengthened to enhance their quality and effectiveness \n(Appendix 8).  \n \n5.  ADB's Assistance to Address Food Security \n \n22.  ADB supported policy reforms and innovative interventions for increasing food grain \nproduction, agriculture inputs liberalization, agribusiness, diversifying crops, and developing the \nlivestock and fisheries sectors. ADB has also assisted in conserving the environment, creating \nand  developing  irrigation  systems,  fostering  small-scale  water  resources,  building  flood \nprotection, and ensuring greater access to markets for villagers. This support has made a major \ncontribution to raise agriculture productivity over recent decades.11 ADB\u2019s country partnership \nstrategy  for  Bangladesh  for  2006\u2013201012\u2014jointly  developed  with  the  United  Kingdom\u2019s \nDepartment for International Development (DFID), Government of Japan, and World Bank\u2014\nemphasizes (i) intensification, diversification, and value addition of crops to boost agricultural \nproductivity,  improve  food  security,  and  foster  rural  nonfarm  enterprise  development;  (ii) \nstrengthened farm-to-market linkages; and (iii) sustained growth of agriculture and agribusiness \nto generate productive on- and off-farm employment to raise rural income.  \n \n23.  Consistent with the country partnership strategy and complementing support by other \ndevelopment partners, ADB assistance to Bangladesh in the agriculture sector over the medium \nto long term will continue to focus on expanding access to irrigation and associated flood \nprotection  through  increased  support  in  both  large-  and  small-scale  water  resources \nmanagement;  and  on  improving  rural  infrastructure  and  raising  agriculture  productivity.  In \naddition to its ongoing support for intensification, diversification, and production of high value \ncrops, ADB will intensify its assistance in capacity development, research, extension, and field \nlevel support services aimed at raising food production. To this end, ADB will refocus the Crop \nDiversification Project II planned for 2010 toward production of staple food crops. ADB will also \nenhance  its  support  in  developing  and  adapting  productivity  enhancing  technologies  and \nstrengthening farm-to-market linkages\u2014complementing ongoing and planned assistance in the \nagriculture sector (Appendix 9).  \n \n                                                 \n11      ADB. 2003.

As a regional multilateral development bank, ADB responded quickly to address the food \ncrisis in Asia and Pacific countries, including Bangladesh, by allocating $500 million in urgent \nbudgetary support to the hardest hit countries for safety nets to protect the poor and vulnerable \nin the face of rising food prices. It formed a task force, which prepared a comprehensive report \nto address the crisis in its member countries. In response to the Government\u2019s request, a needs \nassessment mission was fielded from 27 May to 15 June 2008 to develop the emergency \nassistance needed for food security in Bangladesh, jointly with JBIC and World Bank with the \nsupport of FAO, IMF, USAID, and WFP. The mission held discussions with the Government on \nkey issues relating to safety net programs, subsidies, and macroeconomic implications over the \nshort, medium, and longer term. \n \n25.  Subsidies for fuel and fertilizer are increasingly becoming unsustainable because of \nrising international prices. The recent upward revisions in energy and fertilizer prices are timely \nand will contribute to containing the fiscal deficit in FY2009. Under the Project, the Government \nwill further review options, with the assistance of ADB and other development partners, to \naddress the sustainability of various subsidies affecting the agriculture sector. The Government \nenvisions a phased move to more sustainable pricing, but an immediate increase to world price \nlevels would be too disruptive. In close coordination with other development partners, ADB will \ncontinue to support the various policy reforms to reduce subsidies on energy and agriculture \ninputs to sustainable levels under its ongoing and planned projects/programs for Bangladesh.  \n  \n6.  Response by other Development Partners \n \n26.  Food  security  assistance  from  multilateral  agencies  mainly  focuses  on  budgetary \nsupport  for  implementing  government  safety  net  programs.  Support  from  bilateral  and  UN \nagencies  have  focused  on  food  procurement  and  distribution  through  a  well-coordinated \napproach. In FY2008, funding has been secured from development partners for relief and \nreconstruction following natural disasters, including transitional support credit from the World \nBank and balance of payments support from IMF. Responding to the food crisis, the World Bank \nis preparing budgetary support for the Government based on the joint needs assessment with \nADB and JBIC parallel to ADB\u2019s emergency assistance loan. JBIC and the Islamic Development \nBank are considering cofinancing the Project with ADB. Following the ongoing National Food \nPolicy Capacity Strengthening Program, implemented by FAO and funded by EC and USAID, \nEC and USAID are considering further assistance of about $5 million each for food policy \nimplementation  and  monitoring,  complementary  to  ADB  assistance.  DFID  is  initiating  a \ncomprehensive study on the food crisis. EC is also working on a global response strategy \ncomprising short-, medium-, and long-term measures at the country levels, which will cover \nBangladesh.  In  the  meantime,  USAID  will  continue  funding  the  Jiban  O  Jibika  (life  and \nlivelihood) and Shouhardo (friendship) programs aimed at improving the use of technology for \nincreasing crop productivity. USAID is also contributing $40 million of food aid to Bangladesh\u2014\n$30 million will be distributed over 3 years for the school feeding program and $10 million is \nemergency food aid; this follows $20 million in emergency food assistance after the 2007 \ncyclone. In addition to its earlier contribution of A$9.5 million for communities affected by the \n2007 cyclone, the Government of Australia will provide A$1.2 million in humanitarian assistance \nto meet the essential needs, including for food, of the vulnerable communities in Bangladesh. \nDanish International Development Agency (DANIDA) is also stepping up support for integrated \nagricultural development, for enhancing food production. \n  \n ", "10 \n7.  Portfolio Restructuring \n \n27.  In formulating the proposed emergency food assistance, the possibility of loan portfolio \nrestructuring and potential use of Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan savings under ongoing \nprojects  were  carefully  assessed  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s  policy  on  disaster  and  emergency \nassistance.13 The  portfolio  assessment  was  made  as  part  of  the  comprehensive  country \nportfolio  review  in  200814 and  regular  project  reviews  in  close  consultation  with  relevant \ngovernment agencies. Over the past 5 years, ADB has emphasized regular portfolio review to \nidentify and cancel ADF loan savings, by examining the physical and financial progress of \nongoing projects and adjusting their scope and design. During 2007, a total of $157 million in \nADF loan savings were cancelled.15 As a result, the scope for identifying additional loan savings \nby restructuring the ongoing portfolio became limited. However, after careful review and detailed \nconsultations with relevant executing agencies (EAs), further loan savings of $46 million were \nidentified  during  the  2008  country  portfolio  review  from  eight  loans  for  cancellation  at  the \nGovernment\u2019s request.  \n \n8.  Governance and Corruption \n \n28.  Despite efforts by successive governments, weak governance was a key challenge in \nBangladesh  until  the  current  caretaker  Government  was  installed  in  January  2007.  The \nGovernment has accomplished some critical governance reforms during the last 18 months, \nwhich  include  (i)  reconstitution  and  operationalization  of  the  Anti-Corruption  Commission, \n(ii) ratification of the United Nations Convention against Corruption, (iii) submission of asset \ndeclarations by members of the civil service, (iv) making the judiciary independent by separating \nit from the executive, and (v) reconstitution of the Public Service Commission and revision of \ncivil service recruitment rules to ensure merit and transparency in the civil service selection \nprocess. The Government is expected to enact a law soon on the right to information to \nenhance transparency, accountability, and public sector responsiveness and efficiency. ADB \nhas been supporting the Government in implementing most of these critical governance reforms \nunder  the  Bangladesh  Good  Governance  Program.16 The  Government  is  also  preparing  a \ncomprehensive  National  Integrity  Strategy  with  ADB  assistance  to  address  corruption \nholistically. 17 These governance reforms are expected to reinforce the Government\u2019s efforts to \ncurb public sector corruption effectively.   \n \n29.  Public procurement, generally associated with a high level of corruption, is undergoing a \nmajor  reform  program  supported  by  ADB,  World  Bank,  and  other  development  partners \nfollowing  new  public  procurement  regulations  that  became  effective  in  October  2003.  To \nenhance  transparency,  the  Government  made  the  Public  Procurement  Act  effective  from \n31 January 2008. At the sector level, the Government has appointed a focal point in each line \nministry,  including  the  MoFDM,  to  address  public  complaints  and  establish  an  effective \ngrievance handling mechanism in all public sector agencies. MoFDM is among the 16 Medium \n                                                 \n13   ADB. 2004. Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy.

An integrated budgeting and accounting system has been developed to facilitate \nthe centralization of all accounting data from districts and ministries. Strengthening of financial \nmanagement and auditing has also been aided by training provided under ADB TA to the \nForeign Aided Projects Audit Directorate (FAPAD) of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor \nGeneral of Bangladesh.18  \n \n30.  MoFDM has a well-functioning and reliable monitoring system to ensure transparency in \nthe procurement and distribution of food grains (the PFDS). The food planning and monitoring \nunit under MoFDM provides a daily countrywide report on the PFDS by collecting data from food \nsilos,  ports,  and  other  food  warehouses  located  at  the  district  and  subdistrict  level.  The \nDirectorate of Food also has an internal audit unit, reporting directly to its director general, to \nconduct concurrent and post-audit of all transactions in the directorate. The proposed Project \nand  attached  TA  incorporate  several  measures  to  help  further  enhance  efficiency  and \ntransparency in food procurement and distribution\u2014including (i) provisions for strict financial \nmanagement with strengthened government accounting, auditing, and special audit as part of \nFAPAD auditing, supported by the TA consultants; (ii) strengthened capacity of the internal audit \nunit;  (iii)  establishing  a  computerized  network  with  the  silos,  ports,  and  district  level  food \nwarehouses; (iv) strengthened government monitoring and strong project supervision of the \nsafety net programs; and (v) independent spot checks by ADB staff and the TA consultants.  \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n31.  The main impact of the Project will be to prevent poverty from rising. The Project will \nimprove the food security of poor and vulnerable people affected by repeated natural disasters \nand rising food prices. It will contribute to the Government\u2019s efforts so that 5 million poor and \nvulnerable people have better access to food. It will reduce the poverty levels of low-income \ngroups. The focus of the Project will be on improving access of the poor to food, income, and \nlivelihood support. It will assist in relieving the immediate fiscal pressures because of a sharp \nrise in safety net expenditures. It will also assist in sustaining the external balance, aggravated \nby higher import costs for food grains.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n32.  The Project will provide short-term transitional support to help the Government meet \nunexpected high expenditures for safety net programs for the poor and vulnerable affected by \nsoaring food prices. It will provide $170 million to finance the programs. In accordance with \nADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, the financing will only be used for essential \nimports  identified  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  safety  net  programs  for  food  security \n(Appendix 10). Following are the major outputs of the Project:  \n \n(i)  Output 1:  Strengthened open market sales of food grains with wider coverage \nto  ensure  food  security  for  1.1  million  person-months  of  targeted  poor  and \nvulnerable people. The hardship of poor people affected by higher food prices \n                                                 \n18   ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Strengthening Project Portfolio \nPerformance. Manila.  \n ", "12 \nwill be mitigated with expanded coverage and improved efficiency under open \nmarket sales.    \n(ii)  Output 2: Enhanced food entitlements for 5.4 million person-months for the poor \nand vulnerable to survive short-term food deficits. The poor and vulnerable will \nhave better access to food through various safety net programs, such as the \nvulnerable group development program, vulnerable group feeding program, test \nrelief (food), gratuitous relief, food assistance for Chittagong Hill Tracts tribal \npeople, and the food for work program. Employment opportunities will be created \nfor the poor and vulnerable, disadvantaged groups, and functionally landless and \nlow-income earners through food grain transfer, which will help improve rural \ninfrastructure development through the participation of low-income communities.    \n(iii)  Output 3: Enhanced purchasing power of the poor and vulnerable by generating \nrural employment for 1 million person-months. Employment guarantee schemes \nwill create employment opportunities for the poor and vulnerable in poverty-\nstricken areas when unemployment is at its peak.  \n(iv)  Output 4: A more effective and efficient food security monitoring system. This \ncomponent will be assisted by the attached TA to support reform measures and \nfiduciary  oversight  to  strengthen  monitoring  for  increasing  the  efficiency  of \nongoing safety net programs, complementing assistance from other development \npartners. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n33.  Consultation,  Coordination,  and  Partnerships.  The  Project  was  formulated  and \nprepared in close consultation with the Government and Bangladesh\u2019s development partners. \nThe  project  design  incorporates  feedback  from  beneficiaries,  including  vulnerable  groups, \nduring the needs assessment. The Project is based on the joint needs assessment of the \nGovernment, ADB, JBIC, and World Bank with the support of other development partners \nincluding FAO, IMF, USAID and WFP. Food security assessments by Bangladesh Institute of \nDevelopment Studies were also considered in formulating the design of the Project.  \n \n34.  Loan Terms. While the Project is being processed as an emergency assistance loan \nunder ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, regular ADF project lending terms are \nbeing  proposed  in  consultation  with  the  Government.  Regular  ADF  lending  term  already \nprovides an extra fiscal space. The Government\u2019s urgency is to mobilize adequate cash flow for \nproviding transitional safety nets to the poor and vulnerable. Without the proposed loan, the \nGovernment would be forced to seek additional funding from the banking system at a high rate \nof interest for a shorter repayment period. This would adversely affect the Government\u2019s fiscal \nbalance as well as private sector operations. It would crowd out the private sector from available \nfinancing  sources,  and  could  cause  an  extended  impact  throughout  the  community.  The \nproposed loan will provide the necessary cash flow to provide urgent, transitional support to the \nsafety net programs for the poor and vulnerable. In these circumstances, the ADF lending terms \nare considered appropriate to accommodate this requirement. \n \n35.  Flexible  Approach  and  Procurement.  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as \namended from time to time) provide special exemptions for emergency assistance that are \nadopted for this Project.19 Previously, during natural disasters, exporting ADB member countries \nhave sold food supplies to Bangladesh on terms and conditions lower than normal world trade \n                                                 \n19   ADB. 2007. Procurement Guidelines. Section 3.18. Procurement under Disaster and Emergency Assistance. \nManila. Available: www.adb.org/documents/guidelines/procurement/Guidelines-Procurement.pdf. \n ", "13 \nprices.  Therefore,  under  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines,  wheat  and  rice  imports  may  be \nprocured  in  accordance  with  the  Government\u2019s  standard  public  procedures  for  emergency \nprocurement and normal private sector commercial practices acceptable to ADB, with due \nconsideration to economy and efficiency.  \n \n36.  Quick  Disbursing.  ADB\u2019s  Disaster  and  Emergency  Assistance  Policy  expressly \ncontemplates the inclusion of quick-disbursing components in emergency assistance loans to \nfinance imports considered necessary. The drawdown for the retroactive financing and the one \nadvance to the imprest account will be quick-disbursing as provided under the policy.  \n  \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n \n37.  The total cost of the government food safety net program is estimated at $1,293 million.   \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n38.  The  Government  has  already  diverted  significant  resources  from  its  general \ndevelopment  priorities  to  meet  public  food  requirements.  In  light  of  the  adverse  fiscal \nperformance  (para.15),  the  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  provide  a  loan  of  Special \nDrawing Rights 104,247,000 (equivalent to $170 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nto help finance the Project. The loan will carry an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during the \ngrace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 \nyears; and other terms as those set out in the Loan Agreement. The Government will bear the \nforeign exchange risk. \n \n39.  The Government has requested financing from other development partners. If all the \nsources of external funding materialize, the Government will be able to recoup a portion of the \nsafety net program expenditures.  \n \n40.  Cofinancing Opportunities. An underlying objective of ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency \nAssistance Policy is to coordinate with development partners, minimize duplication, encourage \ncofinancing, and have a catalytic effect on the provision of additional resources. Several of \nthese partners may be willing to complement ADB\u2019s funds for the Project through cofinancing \nand/or parallel financing. ADB has typically sought the approval of ADB\u2019s Board of Directors for \nthe administration of loan or grant funds from co-financiers only when cofinancing commitments \nare in place. ADB has received indications from some development partners of their interest in \nproviding loans and grants to finance the Project. JBIC and the Islamic Development Bank are \nconsidering cofinancing the Project with ADB. The World Bank is preparing parallel financing of \nthe  Project  (in  an  amount  preliminarily  estimated  at  $100  million). As  it  is  envisaged  that \ncofinancing in the form of loans and/or grants will be provided from donors, which ADB will be \nrequested to administer, the scope of the overall project financing requirements reflects this \nlikely additional funding. In the event such financing does not materialize, the Government will \nfill the financing gap. Given the need for expediency and efficiency in ADB\u2019s response to the \nfood crisis, ADB Management requests Board approval of the administration of such cofinanced \nfunds  obtained  from  development  partners  subsequent  to  the  date  of  Board  approval. \nManagement  will confirm  and  approve  such cofinanced funds,  and report  to  the  Board  in \naccordance  with  the  standard  reporting  procedures.  Any  proposed  cofinancing  that  would \nmaterially affect the objectives, purpose, or scope of the Project will be processed as a major \nchange of scope and circulated to the Board in accordance with ADB\u2019s Project Administration \nInstructions 5.04 and the usual practice.  \n \n ", "14 \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n41.  The Finance Division of the Ministry of Finance will be the EA and MoFDM will be the \nImplementing Agency. The loan will flow to the budget of the Government, which will contribute \nfunds to MoFDM\u2019s account through the budget allocation process. MoFDM will arrange the \nprocurement of eligible imports. All transactions will be conducted through bank accounts, with \nno  cash  changing  hands.  Overall  project  coordination  will  be  provided  by  a  food  security \nsteering  committee  (FSSC),  chaired  by  the  secretary  of  the  Finance  Division,  Ministry  of \nFinance. The FSSC will include representatives at joint secretary level from the Economic \nRelations  Division  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  MoFDM,  Planning \nCommission, and Directorate of Food and Directorate of Relief and Rehabilitation of MoFDM. \nThe FSSC will be responsible for addressing the policy and governance issues addressed by \nthe Project. \n \n42.  To ensure timely implementation, ADB will delegate the responsibility for ADB\u2019s project \nadministration  to  the  Bangladesh  Resident  Mission,  which  has  extensive  experience  in \nadministering similar projects, and will closely monitor compliance with ADB\u2019s requirements \nunder the Project to ensure quality control and accelerated implementation through close follow-\nup and guidance to the relevant ministries and agencies on project implementation matters. \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n43.  As the Project is for emergency assistance, project implementation will be substantially \ncompleted by 30 June 2009. \n  \n3.  Procurement \n44.  Essential  imports  financed  from  the  proceeds  of  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Management  has  agreed  to  provide \nretroactive financing for a maximum 30% of the total loan amount for eligible imports incurred \nnot earlier than 1 April  2008, provided that the expenditures are in accordance with agreed \nprocedures, are certified by the Finance Division, and the certification is acceptable to ADB. \nRetroactive financing will be approved under the following conditions: (i) in accordance with \nagreed procedures, (ii) verified by ADB, (iii) certified by the Finance Division, and (iv) the \ncertification is acceptable to ADB. ADB advised the Government that provision of retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance any part of the Project. For the balance of the loan \nfunds, procurement details are outlined in para. 35. The procurement plan is in Appendix 11.  \n \n4.  Consulting Services \n45.  No  consulting  services  will  be  provided  under  the  emergency  assistance  loan.  \nConsulting services support for implementation will be provided under the attached TA project.  \n \n5.  Project Monitoring and Anticorruption Measures \n46.  Strong Oversight Mechanisms to Manage Fiduciary Risks. Emergency assistance \nmust be supported by sound financial management and operational procedures, as well as \nmonitoring and evaluation mechanisms. Strengthened fiduciary risk mitigation measures\u2014such \nas quality government audit as well as performance audit, and independent monitoring by the \n ", "15 \nImplementation Monitoring and Evaluation Division (IMED) under the Ministry of Planning and \nexternal audit by FAPAD\u2014are widely adopted under all ADB-assisted projects. Considering the \nGovernment\u2019s  expanded  safety  net  program,  joint  fiduciary  oversight  arrangements  will  be \nestablished with the participation of major development partners including ADB, JBIC, and \nWorld Bank. To strengthen field level monitoring, the Government recently established a high-\nlevel working group on food grain management (with the participation of FAO, USAID and \nWFP), headed by the director general of the Directorate of Food, to ensure efficient food \ndistribution to the poor and effective monitoring. MoFDM will submit quarterly reports in an \nappropriate format to the Finance Division, FSSC, and ADB no later than 3 weeks after the end \nof each quarter. The quarterly reports will cover progress and distribution through different \nsafety net programs, and the expected completion date of the procurement of food grains. \n  \n47.  More resources will be allocated through the attached TA project for additional support in \nspecific areas. Based on recent evaluation of the Government\u2019s safety net programs, the TA \nproject  complementing  ongoing  and  planned  support  by  EC  and  USAID  will  help  develop \nresults-based  monitoring  through  the  integration  of  an  impact  evaluation  system  to  track \nqualitative changes over time and promote active participation of partners in the monitoring. \nGreater emphasis will be placed on developing independent monitoring by IMED and external \naudit by FAPAD, as well as building the monitoring capacity of the line agencies to minimize \nleakage. Because of low administrative capacity within ministries, options for contracting out \nprogram monitoring to independent and competitively selected agencies will be considered with \nthe assistance of the development partners.  \n  \n48.  Capacity development support will be provided under the attached TA to manage food \nprocurement  and  distribution  in  a  transparent  and  effective  manner.  The  anticorruption \nmeasures adopted under the emergency assistance loan include (i) strict financial management \nwith submission of annual audited accounts and internal audit report by the EA; (ii) strengthened \ngovernment monitoring; (iii) strong project supervision with appropriate TA consultancy input; \n(iv) periodic reviews of accounts, statements of expenditure, and close monitoring of the safety \nnet  programs;  and  (v)  random  and  independent  spot  checks  by  ADB  staff  and  the  TA \nconsultants in coordination and consultation with the Government.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy   \n49.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these \nefforts,  relevant  provisions  of  ADB\u2019s  Anticorruption  Policy  will  be  applied  in  project \nimplementation.  \n \n50.  The Government and EA agree to cooperate with any such investigation and extend \nnecessary  assistance,  including  access  to  all  relevant  books  and  records,  as  well  as \nengagement of independent experts that may be needed for satisfactory completion of such \ninvestigations. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n51.   All disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(2007, as amended from time to time) or as agreed with ADB. An imprest account will be \nestablished by the EA in Bangladesh Bank. The EA will be responsible for managing and \n ", "16 \nadministering the imprest account in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. \nThe specific additional arrangements are as follows: \n \n(i)  Retroactive  financing.  Withdrawal  applications  must  be  accompanied  by  a \ncertificate of the EA confirming that the value of the eligible expenditures is \ngreater than the loan amount claimed for disbursement.  \n(ii)  Imprest fund procedure. Withdrawal applications must be accompanied by a \ncertificate of the EA confirming that the amount of eligible expenditures to be paid \nfor by MoFDM during the period from loan effectiveness to 30 June 2009 is \nprojected to be greater than the amount of the requested withdrawal. Payments \nfrom the imprest account should only be used for financing essential imports \n(Appendix  10).  Advances  to  the  imprest  account  will  be  liquidated  with \nappropriate supporting documentation as agreed by ADB. ADB will reserve the \nright  to  audit  the  use  of  the  loan  proceeds  and  verify  the  accuracy  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s documentation. \n \n8.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n52.  The EA will maintain records and accounts adequate to identify the goods financed by the \nloan proceeds. Project accounts will be set up in accordance with sound accounting principles. \nThe EA will ensure that the consolidated project accounts and related financial statements will be \naudited annually by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh. The audited \nreports and related financial statements in English will be submitted to ADB not later than 6 \nmonths after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. The audits include the auditor\u2019s \nopinion on the use of the procedures for imprest account and statement of eligible imports. In \naddition to the government audit, for the procurement of goods financed from this loan, ADB or its \nagents will undertake a special audit in coordination with FAPAD and IMED, as part of the TA \nproject. The MoFDM will provide ADB, through the EA, an overall project completion report \nproviding detailed evaluation of the project design, costs, performance, social and economic \nimpact, and other details as requested by ADB. \n \n9.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n53.  The EA will carry out project performance monitoring and evaluation and will report to \nADB on a  monthly basis. Baseline indicators and targets are indicated in the design and \nmonitoring framework (Appendix 1). The monthly reports and other outputs will provide inputs to \nthe Project\u2019s quarterly and overall progress reporting.  \n \n10.  Project Review \n \n54.  ADB  will  conduct  regular  reviews  throughout  project  implementation.  Given  the \nimplementation  period  and  emergency  nature  of  the  Project,  no  midterm  review  will  be \nconducted unless ADB and the Government deem it necessary.  \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n55.  TA  for  Strengthening  the  Government\u2019s  Institutional  Capacity  for  Improving  Food \nSecurity will be provided to support reform measures and fiduciary oversight supported by the \nProject (Appendix 12). The objective of the TA project is to improve the Government\u2019s capacity \nfor  planning  and  undertaking  mid-  and  long-term  interventions  to  improve  food  security, \nincluding strengthening  monitoring for increasing the efficiency of ongoing safety net programs. \n ", "17 \nThe activities of MoFDM will focus on improving the institutional capacity of the ministry to \nadminister,  manage,  and  monitor  safety  net  programs.  Activities  under  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture (MOA) will help strengthen the institutional capacity of its policy, planning, and \ncoordination  unit  for  planning  of  food  production,  input  requirement,  and  procurement  and \ndistribution of inputs. The cost of the TA project is estimated at $660,000. ADB will provide \n$600,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. MoFDM will be the EA for the TA, \nand MOA will be the coordinating agency. An interministerial steering committee chaired by the \nsecretary of MoFDM will oversee and monitor activities under the TA project. MoFDM will \nappoint a project director and MOA will appoint a project coordinator, both at the joint secretary \nor equivalent level. The TA project will commence on 1 September 2008 and will continue for 10 \nmonths.  Activities  under  this  TA  project  will  be  undertaken  in  close  coordination  with  the \nongoing and planned TA project for food policy implementation and monitoring, funded by EC \nand USAID and executed by FAO. \n   \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Economic Benefits \n \n56.  The  Project  will  provide  emergency  assistance  to  the  Government  for  expanding \ntargeted safety nets for the poor and vulnerable at a time when there are inadequate budgetary \nresources  for  financing  these  programs.  It  will  assist  in  sustaining  domestic  and  external \nbalances, affected by heightened international prices of food grains and other commodities. The \nincreased availability of food grains caused by the larger imports (facilitated by this financing) \nwill exert downward pressure on food grain prices. The assistance will foster macroeconomic \nstability by reducing the need for domestic borrowing, thus dampening inflationary pressures \nand avoiding crowding out domestic investment. Fiscal space will be created, making it possible \nto reallocate resources to other essential public expenditures. The quick-disbursing nature of \nthe  Project  will  also  imply  that  the  assistance  would  be  provided  timely  to  the  targeted \nbeneficiaries. Well-coordinated and targeted safety net programs will provide direct support to \nthe neediest at a substantially lower cost than more broad-based actions.  \n \nB.  Poverty and Social Impacts \n \n57.  The Project will help restore the purchasing power of the poor and vulnerable who are at \na greater risk of hunger and malnutrition. Those most vulnerable to food price shocks will be \nprotected from nutritional deprivation, erosion in real income, and asset shedding. A summary of \nthe poverty reduction and social strategy is in Appendix 13. The Project will benefit 5 million \npeople\u2014including men, women, and children\u2014by creating and enhancing their access to food, \nlivelihood,  and  employment.  Poor  and  female-headed  households  will  receive  special \npreference while designing such programs according to the Government\u2019s current policy and \npractice.  These  households  will  also  benefit  from  the  increased  supply  of  essential  food \ncommodities  at  the  market,  helping  women  manage  household  food  requirements. \nDisadvantaged  groups\u2014including  the  landless,  indigenous  people,  and  other  vulnerable \ngroups\u2014will be covered under the programs. The Project will benefit the most vulnerable with \nshort-term relief of food and basic necessities in times of food crisis. The employment guarantee \nscheme for the poor and vulnerable will address extreme poverty by providing employment \nopportunities in poverty-stricken areas. The TA project will help identify bottlenecks in delivering \nthe safety net programs, suggest mechanisms to improve the programs\u2019 effectiveness and \ncoverage, and reduce leakages from the targeted programs. These will also benefit the poor \nand vulnerable. The TA project will also suggest means to ensure that indigenous peoples and \nother vulnerable groups have greater access to the benefits of the safety net programs.  \n ", "18 \n \nC.  Land Acquisition and Involuntary Resettlement \n58.  A  resettlement  framework  was  not  prepared  since  the  Project  involves  budgetary \nsupport for safety net programs, with no provision for any land acquisition or resettlement. \n \nD.  Environmental Impacts \n59.  The Project is classified category C, in accordance with ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy \n(2002). Therefore, no environmental assessment was required.  \n  \nE.  Risks \n60.  Because of the huge volume of emergency food to be distributed, there are some risks \nin the areas of storage and distribution, leakages, and lack of financial accountability in safety \nnet programs. Over time, Bangladesh has developed good capacity and long experience in \nmanaging public food grain distribution and has strengthened the safeguards necessary to \nimplement the safety net and public food distribution programs and systems effectively. Recent \nmeasures, such as the establishment of a working group with donor participation to monitor the \npublic food programs, will mitigate these risks. Moreover, the Project and associated TA include \nfiduciary  oversight  of  the  components  of  the  funds  provided  and  disbursed  for  safety  net \nspending.  Another  risk  is  the  recurrence  of  natural  disasters,  and  the  related  extensive \ndamages, which would strain the country\u2019s administrative capacity in distributing food and other \nessentials, and exert fresh pressures on the budget, involving additional import of these items. \nThis is addressed by adopting appropriate mitigation and cost-effective adaptation measures \nagainst floods and cyclones, including capacity building, which would reduce damage from \nfuture disasters.  \n  \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n  \n61.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government, Finance Division, and MoFDM \nhave given the following assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:   \n \n(i)      Public food distribution. Within 6 months of loan effectiveness, MoFDM will \nfurther improve the implementation procedures of the Government public food \ndistribution system to enhance the public food procurement procedures and the \nmanagement, distribution, and storage systems for public food. \n(ii)      Improving  effectiveness  of  safety  net  programs. Within 6 months of loan \neffectiveness, MoFDM, in coordination with the relevant government agencies \nwill  improve  the  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  the  safety  net  programs  by \nintegrating improved mechanisms to reach really needy vulnerable groups in the \nremote areas and including good governance measures. \n(iii)      Submission  of  quarterly  progress  reports.  MoFDM  will  submit  quarterly \nreports to the EA and ADB on the status and progress of the project-related \nsafety net programs no later than 3 weeks after the end of each quarter.   \n(iv)       Audits. The Comptroller and Auditor General of Bangladesh will conduct an \nindependent financial audit(s) during project implementation to determine the \ndegree  to  which  project  funds  were  utilized  observing  standard  financial \npropriety,  practices,  and  regularity.  Other  audits,  as  required  under  ADB\u2019s \nDisaster and Emergency Assistance Policy, including a performance evaluation \nof the safety net programs supported by this loan, will be undertaken.  \n ", "19 \n(v)      Implementation  Monitoring  and  Evaluation  Division  of  the  Ministry  of \nPlanning.  The  EA  will  ensure  performance  evaluation  of  the  Government\u2019s \nsafety net programs and other project services by IMED and submission of its \ninspection report to ADB not later than 6 months after the completion of each \nfiscal year.  \n(vi)      Anticorruption.  Consistent  with  its  Anticorruption  Policy  and  commitment  to \ngood governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to \ninvestigate directly, or through its agents, any possible financial or management \nimpropriety in implementing the Project.  \n(vii)  Focal point to handle complaints. The EA will appoint a focal point in the \nrespective agencies to address any public complaints on financial irregularities in \nprocurement and distribution of food grains, and other services relevant to this \nloan  and  will  ensure  that  appropriate  grievance  procedures  are  effectively \nimplemented.  The  EA  will  provide  a  biannual  review  and  report  to  ADB  on \ncomplaints received and resolutions undertaken. \n(viii)  Subsidies.  The  Government  will  undertake  dialogue  and  continue  to  review \noptions with the assistance of ADB and other development partners, to address \nthe sustainability of various subsidies affecting the agriculture sector. \n(ix)  Road map to increase agriculture productivity.

In Bangladesh, safety net program is a programmatic mechanism for maintaining social \nharmony through redistribution of resources/foods toward the disadvantaged groups. It plays a \n\u2018social insurance\u2019 role through alleviating miseries of the poor and vulnerable or those at risk of \nhunger due to any irreparable physical or economic shocks. Since the early 1970s, safety net \nprograms have had a tremendous impact on the improvement in the overall food security and \nnutrition status of the poorest people in Bangladesh. These programs have helped the poor and \nvulnerable to improve their livelihoods, health and nutrition status, particularly for women and \nchildren, and income generation. Women became more empowered than before and their ability \nto make decisions, mobilize resources, and exercise choices over various aspects of their lives \nhave improved. Income transfers from the safety net programs also played an important role in \nprotecting and expanding asset bases of the poor and vulnerable. While safety net programs \nare an important component of the government\u2019s social protection strategy, expenditure on the \nprograms is fairly low and lower than what other countries at similar levels of development \nspend on these programs.  \n \n2.  Safety net programs are mainly administered through the Ministry of Food and Disaster \nManagement, Ministry of Social Welfare, and the Ministry of Women and Children\u2019s Affairs \n(Appendix 6). Many of the programs are implemented in collaboration with the nongovernment \norganizations  and  are  often  cofinanced  by  the  development  partners.  While  the  largest \nprograms  are  food-based,  conditional  cash  transfers  have  become  increasingly  important, \nincluding improved access to schooling for children, particularly for the girl children. But the \nfiscal constraints inhibit the program coverage to its desired level. \n \n3.  Food security safety nets operation is a system that has been carried out through the \npublic food distribution system (PFDS) under the Directorate of Food, developed over the years \nwith support of development partners. The PFDS plays three key roles: (i) providing price \nincentives to Bangladeshi farmers for increased production, through domestic procurement of \nrice and wheat; (ii) maintaining a security stock of food grains to meet emergencies arising from \ndisasters such as floods and cyclones; and (iii) supplying food-grains to various groups of the \npopulation. The PFDS\u2019 stocks of food grains must be rotated to accommodate new stocks and \nto prevent losses resulting from quality deterioration. The PFDS operates through 15 distribution \nchannels that broadly fall into two groups: monetized and non-monetized channels. The latter \nare comprised of the food-based safety net programs, accounting for 71% of the total PFDS \ndistribution. \n \n4.  Safety net programs made major contributions toward price stabilization, particularly of \nfood-grains, as well as in the reduction of the national poverty level, through protection from the \nfurther worsening of the hunger situation and the avoidance of a major joblessness situation. \nThose who were extreme poor but lived closer to the poverty line were able to escape extreme \npoverty. These programs also played a major role in developing and improving the country's \ncommunication  through  building  roads,  flood  protection  and  improvement  of  the  irrigation \nfacilities specifically through the construction and maintenance of embankments and channels, \n                                                 \n1     This section is based on the following reports:  \n       World Bank. 2005.

The national poverty reduction strategy also emphasizes \nand recognizes safety net programs as a strategy for mitigating the sufferings of the poor and \nvulnerable groups including hardcore and ultra poor. \n \n5.  Since the last decade, Government\u2019s safety net spending for food security has been less \nthan 1% of GDP with coverage of about 4 million people in each year. But spending and \ncoverage varies in times of natural disasters and subsequent food-grain production shortfall. In \nFY2009, the Government will need to increase safety net expenditures for food security to $1.3 \nbillion or 1.5% of GDP for 5 million people because of higher domestic and international price of \nfood grains. The number of people covered under various safety net programs represents only a \nfraction of those in needs.  Increasing the coverage and maximizing the effect of the programs \nare therefore the major challenges. Attention is needed to: (i) increase the focus on programs \nthat  contribute  to  human  capital  development,  (ii)  reduce  the  impact  of  seasonality  in  the \navailability of work, (iii) increase the focus on the urban poor, and (iv) increase focus on other \ndisadvantaged  groups.  Right  targeting  play  important  role  in  maximizing  impacts  of  the \nprograms. By improving currently followed targeting criteria, the safety net programs can be \nmade more effective. To improve targeting, households will be targeted using criteria that are \nmost closely related to occupation and income rather than assets such as land. Targeting \ncriteria need to be consistent across programs.  \n \n6.  Leakage in safety net programs remains an important issue. Monetization addresses \nsome of the concerns regarding leakages from food transfer programs. But it is not sufficient to \novercome the problem entirely. Minimizing the number of intermediaries in program delivery and \nmaking the decisions of intermediaries transparent has been considered as another option. \nEven  when  benefits  have  been  monetized,  transfers  that  involve  intermediaries  making \ndecisions about variable entitlements can lead to leakage if decisions are not transparent. Food \ntransfers should also be based on transparent procedures that guarantee full delivery and are \nmonitored to ensure that intermediaries are accountable. Leakage can go undetected for long \nperiods, undermining a program, if there is little or no monitoring and evaluation. Realigning the \nincentives for service delivery is also a critical step in reducing leakages. Problems of leakage \nand  misallocation  may  go  undetected  because  of  inadequate  program  monitoring  and \nmanagement capacity. Putting greater emphasis on external monitoring as well as building \nmonitoring  capacity  of  the  line  agencies  would  minimize  leakage.  Because  of  weak \nadministrative capacity within ministries, more program monitoring could be contracted out to \nindependent and competitively selected agencies. While line ministries should enhance their \ncapacity to monitor programs on a day-to-day basis, this could be complemented by monitoring \ncarried  out  on  a  random  basis  by  external  agents  that  would  visit  sites  to  monitor  how \nbeneficiaries are targeted and selected, assess whether beneficiaries are receiving appropriate \nbenefits in a timely manner, and assess whether the ministry is adequately monitoring its \nprograms.  Channels  should  be  developed  to  ensure  that  these  results  feed  back  into  the \nplanning process and are used to make informed decisions on redesigning the programs if \nnecessary.  Attention  should  also  be  given  to  designing  alternative  qualitative/participatory \nbeneficiary assessment. Consideration also needs to be given to the application of randomized \nevaluation techniques for programs which are still at their early stages of development. \n \n7.  Planned in the national context, all safety net programs cannot equally address the \nregional  specificities  like  proneness  to  frequent  floods,  river-erosion  and  seasonal \nunemployment. Disbursement frequencies and amounts of benefits for such areas should be \ndifferent from the nationally common ones. For example, duration of vulnerable group feeding \n ", "  Appendix 8  33 \nschemes in Monga-prone areas2 of the Northern Bangladesh need to be expanded from three \nmonths to five months. In flood prone river-basin areas, people need resettlement and house \nreconstruction loans as well as food subsidy during rainy seasons. While amount of vulnerable \ngroup feeding support needs to be increased in these areas especially during monsoon, food for \nwork scheme can be considered as viable safety-net option during other periods of the year.  \n \n8.  Further  sharpening  and  improvement  of  the  safety  net  programs  require:  (i)  more \ninvestment  in  building  management  capacity  of  the  national  partners  and  Government, \n(ii) assessing sustainability issues of the project benefits with particular focus on graduation of \nthe participants into mainstream development programs and continued access to micro-credit, \n(iii) skills training trades and process, (iv) involvement of male family members in the relevant \nawareness building sessions to make the gender mainstreaming more effective, (v) further \nstrengthening the role of nongovernment organizations in the women selection, and (vi) improve \nresults based monitoring through the integration of an impact evaluation system to track the \nqualitative changes over time and promote active participation of partners in the monitoring. The \nabove recommendations are being and will be continued to be implemented with support of the \ndevelopment  partners  including  European  Commission,  World  Food  Program,  Food  and \nAgriculture Organization, United States Agency for International Development, and ADB. \n \n                                                 \n2   Monga is seasonal food insecurity in ecologically vulnerable and economically weak parts of northwestern \nBangladesh. \n  \n ", "Appendix 9  34 \n \nBANGLADESH AGRICULTURE SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  The Sector \n \n1.  In FY2007, agriculture sector contributed 22% and the rural non-farm sector largely \nlinked  with  agriculture  sector  contributed  about  33%  of  GDP.  Small  farm-size  and  rice- \ndominated farming systems with 180% cropping intensity are the key features of Bangladesh \nagriculture. About 85% of the poor in Bangladesh live in rural areas and depend directly or \nindirectly on on-farm activities for their livelihoods. Agriculture comprising of crops, livestock, \nfishery  and  forestry  subsectors  employs  two  thirds  of  the  total  labor  force  of  the  country. \nEnsuring food security for the growing population and reducing poverty are intimately linked. \nConsidering  food  availability  and  affordability  of  common  people,  agricultural  development \nremains  at  the  forefront  of  the  country\u2019s  development  agenda.  Despite  a  declining  direct \ncontribution of agriculture to GDP, faster growth in agriculture sector is still vital for ensuring \nfood security and sustainable poverty reduction in Bangladesh.  \n \n1.  Performance \n \n2.  In Bangladesh, the performance of crops (mostly rice) dominated agriculture sector is \nlargely dependent on weather condition. As a disaster prone country, Bangladesh faces natural \ndisasters like flood, cyclone almost every year, but severity, intensity, and frequency differ from \nyear to year. During the past decades, agriculture sector performed reasonably well despite \nnatural calamities, comparatively low investment and inadequate importance attached to the \nsector by domestic policy makers and the development partners. Growth averaged 3% over the \nperiod from FY1990 to FY2007 despite numerous problems and constraints including increasing \nhigh cost of production inputs.     \n \n2.  Challenges and Opportunities  \n \n3.  At present, the net cultivable area stands at about 9 million hectares out of total land \narea of about 14.8 million hectares. The cultivable land is declining due to rapid urbanization, \nhousing  and  other  infrastructure  development  including  industry  and  an  expanded  roads \ntransport network. 1 Another important shift is the increased proportion of small farm holdings \nwith declining trend of medium and large-sized farms. Currently, the key sector challenges \ninclude  (i)  stagnant  farm  productivity;  (ii)  ensuring  availability  of  critical  production  inputs \n(fertilizers,  irrigation  water,  quality seeds,  and  credit)  at  farmers\u2019  level;  (iii)  poor  marketing \nsystems  for  agricultural  commodities;  (iv)  absence  of  adequate  processing,  value  addition \nfacilities and lack of enabling environment for agribusiness development; and (v) low efficiency \nof public agencies in providing extension and technology services to the farmers.   \n \n4.  Because  of  agro-climatic  suitability,  many  economically  important  crops  including \ncereals can be grown throughout the year in most of the cultivable areas, which creates ample \nopportunities for undertaking judicious efforts for intensification and diversification of crops, \nparticularly in the flood free zones. Over the years, the share of agriculture expenditures (crops, \nlivestock, fisheries and forestry) in the Government budget has declined. Development partners\u2019 \nsupport  during  the  last  decade  for  the  sector  also  witnessed  declining  trend.  Despite  all \nchallenges, since independence in 1971, the annual food production increased almost two times \n(about 29.0 million tons in FY2008 as against 15 million tons in FY1973) and simultaneously \n                                                 \n1   The cultivable land has shrunk from about 66% in 1974 to 59% in 1995, mostly because of rapidly increasing \nurban and residential encroachment. The net cropped area has decreased by 6% from 59% to 53% during 1974 \nto 1996. \n ", "  Appendix 9  35 \npopulation also almost doubled (74.3 million in 1973 and 142.4 million in 2008). Despite the \nachievement of a near self-sufficiency in rice production over the past decades, food security \nremains elusive, especially in the years when production is affected by natural disasters. \n \n5.  The  strategies  for  moving  ahead  in  addressing  these  challenges  include  (i)  a  two-\npronged approach for intensification of major cereal crops, particularly rice, and diversification \ninto high value horticultural crops; (ii) ensuring availability of critical production inputs at farmers \nlevel at reasonable price; (iii) creating enabling environment for improving processing, value \naddition, storage, marketing and agribusiness development; (iv) increasing efficiency of public \nservice providing agencies; and (v) building adequate food reserve for quick market intervention \nby the Government.     \n \nB.  Government Strategy  \n \n6.  Recognizing the importance and impacts of agricultural development, the Government \nprepared and adopted national agriculture policy, national land use policy, national water policy, \nand national agricultural extension policy during last decades. The Government took various \nmeasures  to  transform  these  policies  into  actions,  but  in  many  cases  deficiencies  were \nobserved in reinforcing the agreed actions and regulations. In recognition of main driver of rural \ngrowth, major source of generating rural employment, ongoing private sector led transformation \n(commercial orientation) in agriculture sector, and intimate link between agricultural growth and \nrural  non-farm  economic  activities,  the  Government  has  identified  agriculture  and  rural \ndevelopment as a topmost development agenda for faster poverty reduction and ensuring food \nsecurity to the fast growing population of the country.  \n \n7.  The  national  poverty  reduction  strategy  (NPRS)2 identified  four  areas  of  focus  for \nagriculture and rural development: (i) intensification of major cereal crops including rice; (ii) \ndiversification  of  high  value  non-cereal  crops  (vegetables,  fruits,  pulses,  and  spices);  (iii) \ndevelopment of non crop agriculture (fishery and livestock including poultry); and (iv) promotion \nof rural non-farm activities (rural infrastructure, transport and services). The NPRS emphasized \nfood  security,  including  availability,  access  and  utilization  of  food.  It  calls  for  increased \nproductivity through ensuring inputs supply; agricultural trade liberalization; ensuring national \nand local level stock of critical food items; assuring low cost food supply including disaster relief; \ntargeted  safety  nets  and  food  distribution  programs;  policy  support;  and  food  related \ninfrastructure  development.  Reflecting  the  strategic  focus  of  the  NPRS,  the  Government \napproved in 2006 the National Food Policy, to ensure adequate food and food security to the \npoor and vulnerable.  \n \n8.  In  view  of  the  soaring  food  prices  and  limited  availability  of  cereal  grains  in  the \ninternational market for import, the Government is placing greater emphasis on enhancing \ndomestic food production, increasing food reserves through both domestic food procurement \nand imports, improving and widening distribution  of staple food items, and improving efficiency \nin food procurement and distribution system. The Government quickly responded to the food \ncrisis with a number of measures, which include widening and improving safety net programs \nand ensuring availability of critical inputs like fertilizer, irrigation water and improved seed and \ncredit  support  for  boosting  domestic  food  production  for  the  coming  season.  The  FY2009 \nnational budget is more friendly to farmers and pro-poor oriented and has significantly greater \nallocation for agriculture, rural development and poverty reduction.  \n \n                                                 \n2   Government of Bangladesh. 2005.

ADB supported policy reforms and innovative interventions for increasing food grain \nproduction, inputs liberalization, agribusiness, diversifying crops, and developing the livestock \nand fisheries sectors. ADB has also assisted in conserving the environment, creating irrigation \nsystems, fostering small-scale water resource, building flood protection, and ensuring village \npeople\u2019s greater access to markets.  \n \n10.  Under the country partnership strategy for Bangladesh for 2006\u201320103, more focused \ninterventions on crop intensification and diversification, agribusiness development, livestock \nentrepreneurship development, and water resources management are undertaken, aiming to \nincrease farm productivity, enhance income of small and marginal farmers and ultimately benefit \nthe rural poor. All these interventions are impacting positively on improving livelihoods of the \nproject beneficiaries including farmers. As of April 2008, ADB provided 51 concessional loan \nprojects/programs amounting to $1.65 billion for the agriculture and natural resources sector, or \n10.4% of the country\u2019s total portfolio. Currently, six loan projects amounting to $205 million are \namong  the  ongoing  portfolio.  In  addition,  ADB,  as  a  long  standing  development  partner, \nsupported rural infrastructure development in Bangladesh, which contributed significantly to the \nimprovement  in  rural  connectivity  that  helped  marketing  of  agricultural  commodities  more \nefficiently by the farmers.  \n \n11.  ADB through its recently completed country programming mission confirmed several \npipeline investment projects for the agriculture and natural resources sector during 2009\u20132011, \nwhich include (i) crop productivity and value adding support project, (ii) participatory small-scale \nwater resources development project, (iii) second command area development project, (iv) \nsustainable  rural  infrastructure  development  project,  and  (v)  third  participatory  livestock \ndevelopment project. In addition, ADB will assist the Government with technical assistance \ngrant for institutional capacity building and for project preparation in the agriculture and natural \nresources sector.       \n \nD.  Food Price Shocks \n \n12.  Recent surge in food grain prices (particularly rice and wheat) and food shortage have \ncaused  tremendous  concern  around  the  world  and  in  particular  for  the  least  developed \ncountries, such as, Bangladesh. Bangladesh faced two consecutive devastating floods and a \nsevere cyclone in late 2007, which, among others, caused significant food production losses. \nThese  production  losses  combined  with  soaring  food  prices  in  the  international  markets \naggravated the situation, which contributed adversely to the significant price increase for food \ngrains and other food items in the domestic market.      \n \n13.  Soaring food prices have hit hard the poor including vulnerable groups, who presently \nneed to spend about 69% of their income on buying staple food. This crisis situation has \nseriously eroded purchasing power of the poorer section of the population. If the current crisis is \nnot addressed properly and timely, the consequent effects would be continued food insecurity, \nmalnutrition  and  increased  hunger  among  poorer  section  of  the  population,  which  may \njeopardize fight against poverty and slowdown economic growth in the coming years. This \nprevailing food crisis warrants immediate response from the Government and the development \npartners.  \n  \n \n                                                 \n3    ADB. 2005.

To  address  soaring  food  prices  and  ensuring  food  security  for  the  population,  the \nGovernment has taken a number of immediate measures that include: (i) reducing import duty \non food grains, (ii) quick and increased food grain import, (iii) undertaking extensive damage \nrecovery  and  income  restoration  programs  following  the  2007  floods  and  cyclone,  (iv) \nundertaking all out efforts to boost boro rice production, (v) widening and intensifying social \nsafety net programs in various poverty stricken and natural calamity affected areas of the \ncountry, and (vi) initiating guaranteed employment program for the  vulnerable population.     \n \n15.  In  line  with  the  national  agriculture,  agriculture  extension,  and  food  policies,  the \nGovernment attaches high importance to increase domestic food production particularly rice by \nadopting strategy of vertical yield increase and promoting expansion of suitable crops in the \nmarginal  and  underutilized  areas.  The  Government  is  exercising  more  rigorous  advance \nplanning reflecting realistic production targets for major crops through bottom-up planning, and \ninputs requirements, allocating required resources for timely production and procurement of \ncritical inputs, such as, fertilizers, seeds and fuel for irrigation water. Other key measures \ninclude (i) allocating  more budget for undertaking applied agricultural research particularly \ndeveloping suitable high yielding crop varieties for unfavorable environments; (ii) initiatives for \nincreasing efficiency and effectiveness of public services providing agencies (Department of \nAgriculture Extension, Department of Livestock Services, the Directorate of Food, and Forest \nDepartment); (iii) undertaking additional investment and technical assistance projects supported \nby the development partners including ADB  to ensure adequate investment, support services, \nand technology dissemination to the farmers;  (iv) building partnership with nongovernment \norganizations and other private organizations for ensuring need based services to the farmers; \nand (v) reorienting focuses of the ongoing projects towards addressing food security in the \ncoming years.  \n  \n \n \n ", "Appendix 10  38 \n \nLIST OF PERMISSIBLE IMPORTS \n \n \nNo.  Description \n  Food grain (rice and wheat) \n   \nSource: Asian Development Bank fact-finding mission.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 11   39 \n  \nPROCUREMENT PLAN \n \nProject Information  \nCountry  People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh \nName of Borrower  People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh \nProject Name  Emergency Assistance for Food Security \nProject \nLoan or technical assistance Reference  To be determined (tbd) \nDate of Effectiveness  tbd \nAmount $:  $170 million \nOf which Committed, $   \nExecuting Agency  Finance Division, Ministry of Finance \nApproval Date of Original Procurement Plan   \nApproval of Most Recent Procurement Plan   \nPublication for Local Advertisement   \nPeriod Covered by this Plan  2008\u20132009 \n \nProcurement Methods to be Used \nModified international bidding \nNational competitive bidding \nProcedures appropriate to trade \n \n\u201cProcedures appropriate to trade\u201d means that goods are procured with due consideration to \neconomy and efficiency, in accordance with public procurement rules and the Borrower\u2019s \nstandard public procedures for emergency procurement, and normal private sector commercial \npractices acceptable to the Asian Development Bank (ADB).  \n \n1.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Bangladesh: \n \nBangladesh being an importer of food grains faced tremendous pressure balancing the domestic need and supply of food in \nthe recent months. The country lost agricultural production due to several consecutive natural disasters like floods and cyclone \nin 2007. These combined with the food price shocks driven by higher international prices made the country struggle to ensure \naccess to food by all its citizens, especially the poor. Access to enough food for active healthy life is essential to sustain human \ndevelopment and economic growth. Availability, access and utilization of food are determined by domestic production, external \ntrade and efficient distribution. The Government had to face the dual challenge of controlling price and ensuring food security \nthrough various safety net programs while domestic food stock was depleting before the boro harvesting season. Ensuring \nadequate stock of food, timely supply of agricultural inputs, efficiency in distribution etc. have been identified as means to \novercome the challenge. ADB in the past has supported several projects in the agriculture and irrigation sectors contributing \ntoward increased agricultural productivity. The ongoing Emergency Disaster Damage Rehabilitation Project contributed toward \nimport of food to support the Government developing its food stock, which are contributing towards food security. The \nproposed Emergency Assistance for Food Security Project offers to be instrumental in supporting the government in expanding \nthe safety net programs for restoring income and livelihood of the poor and vulnerable affected by the rise in food prices.  \n \nThe proposed Project will make a significant contribution in cutting poverty by ensuring food security of the poor and \nvulnerable, which is consistent with the national poverty reduction strategy (NPRS). The NPRS emphasized on food security, \non the basis of availability-access-utilization of food. It calls for increased productivity through ensuring inputs supply; \nagricultural trade liberalization; ensuring national and local level stock of critical food items; assuring low cost food supply \nincluding disaster relief; targeted safety net and food distribution program; policy support; and food related infrastructure \ndevelopment. Ensuring availability of food at a reasonable cost at the time of need is critical, which is dependent upon \navailability of stock and smooth distribution mechanism. The Government has taken a multi-pronged approach to face the \ncrisis, which include the above mentioned areas and a proposed guaranteed employment program. \n \nThe Project will support the Government to import essential food items for stock and distribution through various safety net \nprograms including open market sale, food for work and the proposed guaranteed employment program.  \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention (TI-H) \n1. Key Issues \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nBangladesh though witnessed a modest poverty reduction since early 1990s, it remains one of the poorest countries of the \nworld with 40% of its population living below the poverty line as of 2005. A major cause of poverty in the country is loss of \nassets, lives and income due to natural disasters. Since independence in 1971, the country faced many disasters like \ncyclones, floods and droughts, which particularly increased hardship of the poor. The floods and cyclone of 2007 seriously \ndamaged livelihoods and income of millions of people. The livelihoods and food security of already weakened households were \nat jeopardy especially for the rural landless, small and marginal farmers and the microfinance beneficiaries. Impact on health \nwas also tremendous causing mostly waterborne disease, including diarrhea and subsequent malnutrition and morbidity. \nHungry and grief stricken people resorted to relief and the Government had to initiate and expand several targeted safety net \nprograms and the food stock depleted.  \n \nTo make the matters worse, the food price rose to a level beyond reach of these helpless people. The high food price driven by \nhigh international price and internal shortfall due to several disasters drove the low income groups in great food insecurity. \nExpenditure on food rose to about 69% for about 30% of the poorest, especially on rice cutting expenditure on health and other \nnon-food items. The domestic cost of rice production increased even with subsidized agricultural inputs such as diesel and \nurea fertilizer.  Bottlenecks in distribution and hoarding also aggravated the domestic price situation. Non-availability of food in \ninternational markets due to export restrictions imposed by different countries caused severe shortfall in domestic stock \nsituation. The rising food inflation affected household consumption negatively especially for the poor and fixed income \nhouseholds who had to incur high welfare loss.  The poor made up the depletion of real income due to inflation mainly through \nskipping meals or cutting protein consumption, which will have long-term effects on health and nutrition at the household level. \nThese may lead to further sell of assets, resorting to money lenders and rural urban migration. Many of the negative \nconsequences are hidden and cannot be quantified. Women and poor and in some cases children had to seek additional jobs \n ", "  Appendix 13   45 \nin informal sector often compelling them to work for long hours. In some cases children had to skip school to queue up to \ncollect rice from the markets. The marginal farmers and share croppers also suffered losses while they had to procure other \nitems at a high price selling their own products. The rise in food price also led to more unequal distribution of income and \nexpenditure as well as pushed the poor to hard core poor category as food takes the greater share of the total expenditure of \nthe poor families.  \n \nThe NPRS and the National Food Policy emphasize on extending the coverage of effective safety net and social protection for \npoverty reduction. The proposed Project is to support in this area. The Project will provide budgetary support to the \nGovernment for import of foods for ensuring priced and non-priced safety net programs for poor and vulnerable. The \nGovernment will ensure the access of the poor to food through intensive and extensive targeted safety net programs. The poor \nof various regions of the country, especially the famine stricken areas, the char lands and other remote areas. will be covered \nunder the specific safety net programs like food for work, vulnerable group development, guaranteed employment program \ndesigned for various target groups and during disasters. The TA attached to the Project will support the Government in \nincreasing the effectiveness of the targeted safety net programs. It will also ensure that the indigenous people are covered \nunder such programs.  \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe project design includes features that will help reduction of poverty directly or indirectly. These are: \n(i)  Financial support to the Government budget to import foods to assist in reducing the fiscal pressure on the budget \narising from expanded programs for safety nets. The import of food items will contribute towards sustained food supply through \nincreased stock and distribution through various effective safety net programs.   \n \n(ii)  The Project will help implement the Government\u2019s medium and long-term food security road map as outlined in its \nNational Food Policy and the plan of action for implementation of the National Food Policy through a TA support. The TA will \nalso review the distribution efficiency and coverage of the safety net programs in reaching the poor rural households and will \nsuggest means to improve them.  \n \nC.  Poverty Impact Analysis for Policy-Based Lending \nNot applicable \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis  \n \nIt was observed that the poor were hard hit by the natural disasters (floods and cyclone) and food price hikes.  After the initial \nshock of disasters people wanted employment. Opportunities for wage employment, considered the first priority among the \npoorest were decreased. Fertilizer, seeds, poultry feed and capital were the needs of the farmers. Poor faced challenge of \nreduction of employment opportunities coupled with reduction in real wage due to inflation.  The poor women lost self-\nemployment opportunities and faced the challenge in managing the household food security and nutritional needs.  \n \nProduction and stock are not indicators of accessibility of food by the vulnerable groups.  Employment, income, availability of \nfoods in market, efficient safety net programs, efficiency in distribution, affordability etc. are important issues. Because of the \nvarious  bottlenecks,  access  to  food  was  severely  hampered.  The  food  price  hike  not  only  caused  reduction  in  food \nconsumption but also deteriorated the quality of consumption affecting the nutrition level negatively with possible long-term \nhealth impacts.  In some cases, school going children had to miss school or day laborers had to skip work hours for collecting \nfood grain from the open market sale system, where they had to be in the queue for long hours.   \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation.  \n \nThis is an emergency response project and assessment and consultation schedule was drawn jointly with Government and \nother development partners to ensure participation of relevant stakeholders. The relevant Ministries in the Government were \nconsulted on the basis of the consultation schedules. A participatory process was adopted to identify the needs and \ncomponents of the Project during the joint ADB-JBIC-World Bank Mission. Simultaneously, ADB identified the areas to be \nsupported under an ADB-financed loan jointly with the Government. Consultation with civil society was done and regular \ninteraction continued with various agencies during the assessment. ADB support for strengthening safety nets for the poor and \nvulnerable was supported by the stakeholders. The outputs of the mission were: (i) formulation of a project design and \ncomponents to be supported, (ii) formulation of a list of import items to be supported under the Project, and (iii) estimate of \nbudget support. In addition, mechanisms to ensure benefits of poor and women through improved safety net programs and \nemployment guarantee schemes were discussed, and identified. A TA was proposed to help implement medium and long term \nfood security strategy and road map by the Government and suggest means to improve the distribution efficiency and \ncoverage of the safety net programs in reaching the poor.  \n ", "Appendix 13  46 \n \n2.

The civil society including local \ngovernment institutions will be involved in consultation while implementing the TA. NGOs are involved in delivery and \nmonitoring of some safety net programs and will continue to remain engaged.   \nC.   Gender and Development \n1.  Key Issues.  Strategy to maximize impacts on women:  Women are generally the ones to face the challenge of managing \nhouseholds' food security and nutrition needs. During the disasters and food crisis they were the ones hard hit in managing the \nhouseholds' food supply. Female headed households were the worst sufferers. Normally women are the ones to forgo their \nfood and nutrition in favor of other members of the family with severe consequences on their own health. The project will help \nthe Government create stock of essential food items for ensuring household food security during crisis periods. The targeted \nsafety net programs and employment guarantee schemes will be focused on the poor households especially the female \nheaded ones.  Since women constitute majority of the poor population, the targeted programs will ensure their access to food.  \n   \n2.  Key Actions.
