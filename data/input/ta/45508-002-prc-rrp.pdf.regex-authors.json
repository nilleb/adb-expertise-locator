I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  for  the  Xinjiang  Integrated  Urban  Development \nProject.1 The project will improve urban infrastructure facilities and the environment in the cities \nof Kelamayi and Kuitun in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR), which will contribute \nto  sustainable  economic  growth  and  improve  the  quality  of  life  for  about  340,000  urban \nresidents in the two project cities.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n2.  The development of XUAR, one of the poorest and most remote regions in the northwest \nwith a large ethnic minority population of Uygur (46% of the total population) and other minority \nethnic groups (15%), is one of the PRC\u2019s top priorities.3 XUAR is facing serious urbanization \nchallenges and remains poor in terms of economic growth. Water availability is a critical concern \nfor the fragile ecology, which is predominantly a desert territory characterized by strong winds, \nlow rainfall, and high evaporation rates. Infrastructure improvement and provision of basic urban \nservices are needed to facilitate environmentally sustainable economic growth\u2014essential to \nimproving urban living conditions. \n \n3.  Recognizing  the  need  for  greater  national  support,  the  Government  of  the  PRC \ninaugurated  a  twinning  scheme  whereby  assistance  from  other  provinces  will  be  used  to \nstrengthen  the  capacity  in  XUAR  and  improve  local  living  standards.  Nineteen  nominated \nprovinces and/or municipalities are providing financial contributions since 2011 and will continue  \nto  2020.  The  domestic  support  complements  the  growing  strategic  urban  development \npartnership of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region \nGovernment (XUARG), along with efforts of other international development partners.4 ADB is \ncurrently involved in three ongoing urban development projects in the region.5 The proposed \nproject will be the fourth ADB-financed urban development project in XUAR. \n \n4.  The project will help XUAR address a common and major urban development constraint \nby enhancing water availability through strengthening wastewater reuse and improving water \nmanagement in two medium-sized cities\u2014Kelamayi and Kuitun.6 Both cities, which are located \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory technical assistance.

Kuitun is on a strategic transportation route (the Old Silk Road) linking the PRC \nwith  its  central  Asian  neighbors.  The  national  economic  policy  is  to  create  more  balanced  growth  as  a \ncountermeasure to potential large population shifts exacerbating the management of rural\u2013urban migration brought \nabout by economic modernization. ", "2 \nnorthwest of the region\u2019s capital (Urumqi)\u2014Kelamayi 350 kilometers (km) away and Kuitun 220 \nkm are severely water-stressed and have a very harsh climate, with sub-zero temperatures from \nNovember to March. Annual precipitation in Kelamayi is about 100 millimeters (mm) and in \nKuitun  about  189  mm.  The  water  management  problems  created  by  lack  of  rainfall  are \ncompounded by high evaporation rates averaging over 2,000 mm per annum. The project aims \nto help promote balanced and environment-friendly urbanization, improve living conditions in the \ntwo  cities,  and  play  a  demonstration  role  for  cities  with  similar  geographic  and  climatic \nconditions in XUAR and elsewhere.  \n \n5.  The project aims to adopt an integrated approach to infrastructure development and \nenvironmental  improvement.  Both  project  cities  have  prepared  integrated  economic \ndevelopment plans; subprojects were selected in accordance with priorities identified in the \nplans, with improved water management as a common objective for most of the proposed \ninvestment.  Municipal  infrastructure  investment,  particularly  focused  on  improved  water \nresources conservation and management which is considered critical to enable sustainable \ndevelopment of the two cities. \n \n6.  The  overarching  justification  for  the  ADB  intervention  is  to  demonstrate  how \nimprovements in water management can facilitate sustainable economic urban development, \neven in cities with an adjacent desert location, and arid and unfavorable climate for water \nresources management. The project will address two priority water-related issues that feature \nprominently in the local city development plans. In Kelamayi, the major project theme is to \nimprove wastewater management to facilitate wastewater reuse as a substitute for freshwater in \nthe irrigation of urban green space. In Kuitun, the main theme is river rehabilitation to enhance \nflood  protection  standards,  while  creating  a much-improved urban  environment  to  promote \neconomic growth and improve the living conditions of local residents. During project preparation, \nthe  design  of  the  Kuitun  components  was  adjusted  to  include  environmental  sanitation \nimprovements  targeting  a  particularly  deprived  part  of  the  project  area  and  significantly \nimproving  the  inclusiveness  of  the  project  design. 7  In  each  city,  water  management \nimprovements  will  demonstrate  the  benefits  to  be  obtained  from  active  nonrevenue  water \n(NRW) management and optimized water distribution networks. In addition to improved water \nmanagement,  existing  arterial  and  smaller  roads  need  to  be  connected  to  ensure  optimal \ndevelopment  of  the  town  in  west  Kelamayi.  Inter-  and  intra-road  network  improvement  in \nKelamayi and Kuitun is important given their proximity to Tacheng, which has one of the largest \nland ports for trade with the Central Asian republics. The development strategies of Kelamayi \nand  Kuitun  focus  on  their  potential  role  in  and  contribution  to  the  Central  Asia  Regional \nEconomic Cooperation Program (footnote 6).            \n \n7.  Fit with ADB strategy. The project supports environmentally sustainable and inclusive \neconomic growth, which is a key priority of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020.8 By helping foster inclusive \ngrowth and promote environmental sustainability, the project aligns with ADB\u2019s PRC country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132015,9 which supports the government\u2019s strategic goal of building an \neconomically developed society. The project will remove infrastructure constraints, address \nenvironmental  concerns,  promote  sustainable  economic  growth,  and  support  policy  and \ninstitutional reforms in Kelamayi and Kuitun. It also conforms to (i) ADB\u2019s Water Operational \n                                                \n7  Based on extensive consultations with the local community, the project design was adjusted to meet local priorities \nsuch as improved public toilets and solid waste storage and collection.   \n8  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n9  ADB. 2012.

", "3 \nPlan,10 particularly  in  terms  of  the  green  and  competitive  cities  agenda,  as  the  project \nencourages water conservation, including wastewater reuse, and NRW reduction; and (ii) ADB\u2019s \nUrban Operational Plan, which fosters competitive, green, and inclusive cities.11 The project is \nconsistent with the PRC\u2019s Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011\u20132015), which promotes environment-\nfriendly and resource-efficient urban development, and supports the development of the western \nregion. It is consistent with the national economic policy to create more balanced growth as a \ncountermeasure to potential large population shifts exacerbating the management of rural\u2013\nurban migration brought about by economic modernization. \n \n8.  Continuity of development initiatives and incorporation of lessons. The project will \nfollow the 3R12 principles adopted in the Xinjiang Altay Urban Infrastructure and Environment \nImprovement Project to support development of livable cities with a specific focus on water \nreuse and efficiency. The project is envisaged to play a demonstration role for similar cities \nfacing water constraints. The project design incorporates lessons from previous ADB-financed \nurban development projects, particularly the three ongoing Xinjiang projects (footnote 5) in the \nPRC and the ADB Special Evaluation Study on Water Policy and Related Operations.13 In \nparticular, the project will strengthen support for capacity development starting at the early stage \nof  project  preparation,  with  special  focus  on  (i)  improving  awareness  of  ADB  policy  and \nprocedural  requirements  to  facilitate  smooth  implementation  and  timely  compliance,  and  \n(ii) strengthening long-term sustainability of the project-built facilities. \n \n9.  Innovative  features.  Special  project  features  include  (i)  support  for  sustainable \neconomic  development  in  the  project  cities  with  particular  emphasis  on  improved  water \nmanagement; (ii) demonstration of best practices in the use of wetland storage for wastewater \nreuse and water management improvements; (iii) focus on reducing NRW and improving water \nconservation; (iv)  an  extensive  institutional  capacity  building  program for  the  implementing \nagencies  and  for  future  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  units  to  strengthen  operating \nefficiency and project sustainability; and (v) implementation of climate-friendly development \npractices.14 In particular, the reuse of treated wastewater in Kelamayi will diversify the city\u2019s \nwater sources and allow the use of increasingly scarce potable water for only essential domestic \npurposes. The project will contribute to the cities\u2019 target of achieving the status of \u201cmodel water-\nsaving cities\u201d by 2018.15  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved living conditions and environmental sustainability in the \ncities of Kelamayi and Kuitun. The outcome will be improved urban management and services, \nincluding upgraded water supply, roads, and flood control in the project cities. \n \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2012.

Outputs \n11.  The  project  will  take  a  multisector  approach  to  urban  development  where  water \navailability is the critical constraint to economic development and improved living conditions. \nThe project has three outputs. \n \n12.  Output 1: Improvement of Kelamayi\u2019s urban infrastructure. Output 1 will have five \ncomponents: (i) upgrading of the Nanjiao wastewater treatment plant by adding new wastewater \nreclamation  facilities  with  treatment  capacity  of  100,000  cubic  meters  (m3)  per  day; \n(ii) construction of the Jiugongli wetland16 with a surface area of 13.31 square kilometers (kms), \nan average depth of 2 meters, and adequate water volume to receive treated effluent from the \nNanjiao wastewater treatment plant; (iii) construction of 31.1 km of wastewater reuse pipelines \nto supply reuse water from the wetland for urban forestry and landscaping; (iv) construction of \n11.267  km  of  new  urban  roads;  and  (v)  improvement  of  water  management  including \nrehabilitation  of  7.9  km  of  water  supply  pipelines  and  establishment  of  an  effective  NRW \nmanagement capacity.  \n \n13.  Output 2: Improvement of Kuitun\u2019s urban infrastructure. Output 2 will have two \ncomponents: (i) rehabilitation of flood discharge ditches and channels,17 with total length of \n24.72 km together with the auxiliary facilities needed to meet a protection standard of a 1- in 50-\nyear flood; planting of 200,400 trees covering 83.2 hectares; and construction of related roads \nto provide access and ecological protection, and improve the urban visual environment; and \n(ii) improvement of water management including rehabilitation of 9.43 km of water supply pipes \nand significantly improved NRW management capacity.  \n \n14.  Output  3:  Project  management  and  capacity  building.  The  project  will  include \nintensive project management and implementation training for the Xinjiang project management \noffice (XPMO) and city project management offices (PMOs), capacity development assistance \nfor other concerned agencies,18 and recruitment and management of the project implementation \nconsultants.     \n \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans  \n15.  The project is estimated to cost $372.70 million (Table 1). \n \n16.  The  government  has  requested  a  loan  of  $200  million  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period \nof 5 years, straight line repayment method, an interest rate determined in accordance with \nADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility, a commitment charge of \n0.15% per year, interests and other charges during construction to be capitalized in the loan, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan and project agreements. Based \non this, the average loan maturity is 15.75 years and the maturity premium payable to ADB is \n0.10% per annum. The loan will cover civil works, equipment, project management consulting \nservices, and capacity building.  The government will finance the remaining amount of $172.70 \nmillion of project cost including contingencies. The government has provided ADB with (i) the \n                                                \n16  The wetland is being constructed in two phases. ADB will help fund phase 2, which covers 9.93 square kilometers.  \n17 This includes provision of seven public lavatories and 95 communal household garbage containers to serve four \ndeprived neighborhoods, and 400 garbage bins to be installed along the new flood control roads as a measure to \ndiscourage waste dumping in the flood channels.    \n18 Including project implementing units; O&M agencies; county environmental protection bureaus; and agencies \ninvolved with the management of environmental, social, and resettlement safeguards.

DUE DILIGENCE \n19.  The project will directly benefit about 340,000 people in Kelamayi and Kuitun. It will \nimprove  the  cities\u2019  infrastructure  facilities  and  urban  environment  by  building  new  urban \ninfrastructure facilities and enhancing water resources management. Net environmental benefits \nwill be gained from broad improvements in the urban environments including the creation of new \necological resources, improved wastewater management with effluent reuse, and increased \nresilience to flood events. The reuse of wastewater will be primarily for urban forestry and \nlandscaping  (greening)  to  avoid  the  use  of  freshwater  resources  (to  be  used  for  more \neconomically productive purposes).   \n \nA.  Technical \n20.  All project outputs are designed taking into account local circumstances, topography, \nand climate (arid desert conditions with long harsh winters), and in accordance with relevant \nPRC  design  guidelines  and  local  regulations.  The  process  selected  for  the  enhanced \nwastewater  treatment  is  technically  proven  and  suitable  for  the  local  climate.  The  river \nrehabilitation work in Kuitun will greatly improve the resilience of the city to the potential effects ", "7 \nof climate change, while making significant enhancements to the urban environment. Wherever \npossible, the project designs have incorporated 3R approaches and energy efficiency.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n21.  Economic  analysis, 20  including  least-cost  analysis,  benefit\u2013cost  analysis,  and \nassessments of tariffs and affordability, was conducted for all subcomponents. The least-cost \nanalysis confirms the selection of technologies for individual subcomponents. The benefit\u2013cost \nanalysis considered direct impacts on beneficiaries, as well as the social value of water savings \nand  changes  in  greenhouse  gas  emissions.  The  overall  project  and  its  components  are \neconomically viable with the economic internal rate of return for each component in excess of \n17.1%,  and  overall  project  economic  internal  rate  of  return  of  25.5%,  which  exceed  the \neconomic opportunity cost of capital of 12%. The sensitivity analysis considered a variety of \nadverse conditions including standard risks such as price shocks or project delays, as well as \nrisks that are specific to local conditions such as a failure to achieve growth forecasts. The \nsensitivity  analysis  confirms that  the  economic  performance for  each component  is  robust \nexcept the water management subcomponent in Kelamayi, which is sensitive to implementation \ndelays and the resulting achievement of project benefits. Measures to mitigate this risk are \nincluded in the project design.  \n \n22.  The financial analysis for revenue-generating components was based on key financial \nratios describing risk and profitability. It evaluated the viability of the proposed investments by \ncomparing their financial internal rates of return with the weighted average cost of capital. The \nfinancial analysis21 and related sensitivity analysis found the project components financially \nviable provided that recommended tariff and capacity-building measures are implemented. The \nfinancial viability of the Kuitun NRW component is especially dependent on these measures. \n \n23.  Financial  sustainability  analyses  were  completed  for  the  Kelamayi  urban  road \nconstruction and the Kuitun river rehabilitation components. Counterpart funding requirements, \ndebt service costs, and recurrent project O&M costs were compared with forecast revenues and \nexpenditures in both cities. The proposed funds flow arrangement for the project is consistent \nwith the ongoing ADB projects in Xinjiang and use proven domestic disbursement procedures. A \nfinancial management assessment concludes that the \u201cwith-mitigation\u201d risk is low to medium. \nRequired risk mitigation measures are incorporated into institutional development plans within \nthe PAM.  \n \nC.  Governance \n24.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the XUARG and the municipal governments. The procurement capacity assessment22 of \nthe XPMO and city PMOs concludes that the procedural arrangements in place are adequate to \nfacilitate full compliance with ADB procurement guidelines. The specific policy requirements and \nsupplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 19).  \n \n                                                \n20  Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).

Poverty and Social \n25.  The project is expected to create positive social benefits through improvements to urban \necology,  infrastructure,  and  living  conditions.  The  project  will  directly  benefit  an  estimated \n340,000 people, about 8%\u201310% are poor. Project construction will create 5,195 direct and 8,312 \nindirect  jobs,  while  the  operations  phase  will  create  104  direct  and  73  indirect  jobs.  The \nmunicipal  governments have  committed to  prioritize  the  employment  of  vulnerable  groups, \nincluding the poor, women, and ethnic minorities. The implementing agencies will ensure that all \nPRC labor laws and core labor standards are followed. Details on specific measures to ensure \nthe poverty and social benefits are in the social development action plan included in the PAM.23 \nThe social development action plan will facilitate continued consultation and participation of \ncommunities  in  the  project  area,  and  ensure  that  the  needs  of  the  poor  households  are \nconsidered. \n \n26.  The project has several design features to reinforce the positive benefits of improved \naccess and mobility, public health, and livability in the cities. The provision of public toilets and \nawareness programs on road safety, water conservation, and a public hearing process for water \ntariff reforms will help to ensure that the positive benefits of the infrastructure will be sustainable.  \n \n27.  Gender  benefits.  The  project  is  categorized  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming. \nStakeholder consultations found that women in both cities strongly support the project, believing \nthat it will improve their quality of life, address public health risks, and create jobs and income \nopportunities. A gender action plan was prepared to ensure gender benefits accrue in key areas \nof employment, decision-making, participation, and access. Specific actions in the plan include \nemployment and training for women during construction and operation; consultation with women \non  design  and  location  of  public  toilets  and  community-based  waste  collection  and \nmanagement; and outreach, awareness-building, and targets for women's participation in water \ntariff reform. The plan will (i) enhance women\u2019s participation in project activities; (ii) provide \ngender  sensitivity  training  to  PMO  and  implementing  agency  staff;  (iii) ensure  that  project \ndecision-making bodies and capacity-building activities are balanced in terms of the gender of \nparticipants; and (iv) include appropriate gender targets, indicators, and gender-disaggregated \ndata for project monitoring and evaluation.24 \n \nE.  Safeguards \n28.  Environment  (category  B).  An  initial  environmental  examination  including  the \nenvironmental management plan25 was prepared following ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009), and posted on the ADB website in February 2013. The project will have significant \nenvironmental  benefits,  mainly  by  contributing  to  more  sustainable  water  resources \nmanagement. Project construction does have potential impacts on the environment, but these \nare of a temporary nature and covered by stringent site management and procedural provisions \nin the plan, as well as by the loan assurances. The Kelamayi wetland site cleanup has particular \nrequirements in the plan for an independent environment site assessment prior to awarding of \ncivil works contracts. Capacity building in wetland management, integrated pest management, \ncarbon sequestration silviculture, water conservation, and NRW management will help O&M \nunits ensure environmental sustainability of project operations.   \n \n                                                \n23 Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n24  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n25  Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). ", "9 \n29.  Involuntary resettlement (category A). Based on the impact of land acquisition and \nresettlement, the Kuitun municipal government has prepared a resettlement plan for the Kuitun \ncomponents. Based on the preliminary impact survey, 2,178 mu26 of state-owned land will be \nacquired. This includes 532 mu27 of cultivable land owned by a state-owned farm and will impact \n19 households and 66 farm employees. In Kuitun, demolition of 31,781 square meters (m2) of \nhousing will affect 157 households with 600 residents. Another 4,236 m2 of structures will be \ndemolished affecting 56 shops and 127 people. About seven enterprises with 37 workers will be \naffected and 4,546 m2 of structures will be demolished. In total, 830 people will be affected by \nthe project. The Kelamayi municipal government prepared one resettlement plan and two due \ndiligence reports28 for the Kelamayi urban infrastructure output, for which 15,815 mu of state-\nowned land will be acquired affecting one state-owned enterprise and two private enterprises \nwith no affected population. Land acquisition will have no impacts on their production and \noperation. The resettlement planning and implementation approach is designed to ensure that \naffected persons will be better off or at least not worse off as a result of the project.29 Copies of \nthe resettlement plans in local language were sent to local offices to be easily accessible to the \naffected persons.30 The resettlement plans were disclosed to affected persons in local language \nin February 2013 and the resettlement information booklets were distributed and posted on the \nADB website on February 2013. A grievance redress mechanism is in place.  \n \n30.  Indigenous peoples (category B). Ethnic minorities constitute 7% of the population in \nKuitun and 25% in Kelamayi. Although the urban communities are ethnically mixed, some \naspects such as cultural, religious, and linguistic differences are maintained. All households in \nurban areas will benefit from the new infrastructure. Most of the ethnic minority population will \nnot be adversely affected by the project, except for 37 individuals of 12 households who will be \nimpacted  by  house  demolition,  and  6  households  with  11  residents  who  will  lose  their \ncommercial stores in Kuitun. Ethnic minority development plans were prepared and endorsed by \nthe Kelamayi and Kuitun municipal governments.31 The plans focus on measures to facilitate \nthe inclusion of ethnic minorities in all project activities, and ensure that their customs and \nbeliefs will be respected throughout project implementation. Appropriate livelihood restoration \nmeasures associated with resettlement are incorporated in the resettlement plans. The ethnic \nminority development plans were disclosed in March 2013 to ethnic minorities in the areas \ntargeted by the project. Monitoring and reporting arrangements for all these safeguards are \nincluded in the PAM and the project agreement. \n \nF.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n31.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail \nin the risk assessment and risk management plan.32   \n \n                                                \n26  An updated census and detailed measurement survey will be conducted upon finalization of the detailed project \ndesign. The resettlement plan will be updated prior to award of civil works, if there are any changes. \n27 A mu is a Chinese unit of measurement (1 mu = 666.67 square meters).  \n28  The due diligence report is for (i) two demolished brickyards located within the construction area of the proposed \nwetland construction (phase II); and (ii) wetland (phase I) being constructed by the government. Resettlement \nplans are not required for these. \n29 In the PRC, resettlement plans maintain the original terminology of \"affected persons,\u201d which is equivalent to ADB's \ndefinition of \"displaced persons\u201d as defined in the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement. \n30  Resettlement Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n31  Indigenous Peoples Plans (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n32 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nLack of coordination and synchronization  XPMO project monitoring with support from the project \nbetween agencies  implementation consultant \nDelays in land acquisition approvals and  Updating of results from the detailed measurement survey \nimplementation  if the design is changed.

ASSURANCES \n32.  The government and the XUARG have assured ADB that implementation of the project \nshall conform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the PAM and loan documents. The government and the XUARG have agreed with ADB on \ncertain covenants for the project, which are set forth in the loan and project agreements.  \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n33.
