In October 2003, following discussions at the Donor Roundtable meeting in September \n2003,  the  National  Assembly  mandated  the  Government  of  the  Lao  People's  Democratic \nRepublic  (Lao  PDR)  to  implement  the  National  Growth  and  Poverty  Eradication  Strategy \n(NGPES) The NGPES serves as the poverty reduction strategy for the country and aims to \nreduce poverty through strong economic growth and an increased focus on the poorest districts. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) completed the first phase of the technical assistance (TA), \nthat pilot tested implementation of the participatory poverty monitoring instrument in various \ndistricts, established measures of poverty incidence and poverty lines, and built capacity in \nconducting periodic poverty assessments. The current TA will build upon these achievements \nby expanding the pilot test cases of the participatory poverty monitoring instrument, updating the \nparticipatory poverty assessment (PPA) undertaken in 2000 employing (and where necessary, \nimproving upon) the methodology developed in the first phase, strengthening local capacity \nthrough  on-the-job  training  and  workshops,  as  well  as  investigating  the  link  between \ninfrastructure  development  and  trade  and  poverty  incidence  by  drawing  upon  a  recent \nhousehold and consumption survey database. In implementing this TA, ADB will work closely \nwith the National Statistics Centre (NSC) and World Bank. ADB included an advisory TA to \nassess current poverty conditions and the impact of various programs and policies on poverty \nreduction in the 2004\u20132005 Country Strategy and Program Update. Fact-finding for the TA was \nundertaken in March 2004. Discussions were held with representatives of NSC, Ministry of \nFinance, Committee for Planning and Cooperation, World Bank, and Statistics Sweden. Based \non these discussions, an understanding was reached with the Government on the objectives, \nscope, cost estimates, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the consulting \nservices under the TA.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.   ISSUES \n2.  The  Lao  PDR  is  a  land-locked  country  with  a  dispersed  and  ethnically  diverse \npopulation.  Mountainous  terrain,  limited  arable  land,  weak  infrastructure,  low  government \nresources, and limited institutional capacity contribute to poor human development indicators \nand low per capita incomes. On the basis of new poverty thresholds developed by ADB in close \ncollaboration with NSC, 45% of the Lao population was found to be living in poverty in 1992/93. \nSince then, the overall incidence of poverty has decreased quite sharply. The percentage of \npoor  fell  to  39%  in  1997/98,  and  preliminary  estimates  for  2002/03  indicate  that  poverty \nincidence may have fallen to around 32%. Consecutive years of robust economic growth appear \nto have played an important role in the reduction of poverty incidence. Furthermore, indications \nare that a significant portion of this reduction has occurred in the rural sector.   \n \n3.  Despite this, urban-rural differences in poverty incidence persist, and vary substantially \nacross  regions  and  provinces.  Among  the  four  major  regions,  the  north  has  the  highest \nincidence of poverty, while Vientiane Municipality has the lowest. After the northern region, the \nsouth has the highest proportion of poor. Among the 18 provinces, 5 had poverty incidence \nexceeding 50%. Of these 5 provinces, 4 are located in the north. More importantly, not only is \nthe north the poorest region in the country, but its rate of poverty reduction is the lowest.   \n \n4.  While  the  Lao  Government  should  continue  to  follow  growth-enhancing  policies,  it \nshould, at the same time, target the specific groups in the society that are unable to reap the full \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 19 October 2004. ", "2  \nbenefits of growth. Many ethnic groups are unable to take part in economic activities. As a \nresult, they continue to be poor despite high economic growth. How to integrate these people in \nthe mainstream of economic activities is indeed a challenging task and an overarching policy \nissue. Economic growth alone will not be sufficient to achieve a consistent reduction in poverty \nacross districts. The Government clearly recognizes that it will need to better target specific \ngroups in society that are unable to reap the full benefits of economic growth. This is reflected in \nthe NGPES, which targets the poorest 47 districts in its poverty reduction drive. \n5.  The findings from ADB\u2019s first PPA2 in 2000 and the qualitative assessment undertaken in \nthe first phase of this TA support the statistical data in many ways. Economic inequality, as a \nfactor of economic growth, not only between villages and ethnic groups, but also in the realm of \ngender is an important aspect of poverty revealed by the PPA. Thus the negative pull of \ninequality discussed by the quantitative methodology is unambiguous in the PPA as well.  \n6.  Within the country, interest in establishing poverty monitoring systems that combine \nparticipatory exercises with traditional household surveys is increasing. This would allow one set \nof findings to complement or supplement the other or inform the process of conducting it. The \nprocess attempts to combine the important quantitative and qualitative analyses of poverty \nmeasurement  and  merge  their  findings  into  one  set  of  policy  recommendations.  Both \napproaches  will  generally  be  required  to  address  different  aspects  of  the  problem:  the \nquantitative approach will answer much of where poverty is, while the qualitative method will \nfocus  generally  on  why  people  are  poor.  Following  the  completion  of  the  first  phase,  the \nGovernment has accepted and institutionalized the qualitative approach developed and has \naccorded it equal status with the statistical analysis. The need to build better links between \nthese two approaches is critical. The World Bank will take the lead in conducting the overall \nquantitative assessment, and ADB will take the lead in conducting the qualitative assessment. \nHowever, close collaboration and sharing of information on a timely basis will be pursued \nthroughout the duration of the TA.   \n7.  Another area requiring further attention is to improve our understanding of the link \nbetween  project  interventions  and  poverty  outcomes.  In  particular,  a  rigorous  quantitative \nassessment of the impact of infrastructure development and poverty incidence is lacking. How \ndoes increased connectivity through road development, for instance, increase trade and through \nthis  translate  into  changes  in  poverty  levels?  Information  on  these  relationships  and  their \nquantitative magnitude is required not only to validate previous interventions but also guide the \ndesign of future programs. Since ADB has actively encouraged the Government to consider the \npoverty impact of its public investment program, it is appropriate that ADB also examine how its \nproject investments have affected poverty incidence and other social conditions. \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nA.  Purpose and Output  \n8.  The major purpose of the TA is to respond to the recommendations of, and build and \nexpand upon the achievements from, the first phase of this TA by strengthening the poverty \nmonitoring and evaluation system in the Lao PDR. Enhancing the Government's capacity to \ndevelop effectively targeted poverty reduction programs, and improving institutional capacity in \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2000.

", "    3\nthe area of qualitative and quantitative poverty assessment are the main expected outputs of \nthe TA. The TA will also support the analytical phase of a new consumption and expenditure \nsurvey that will be the primary source of poverty estimates. One of the outputs of this analysis \nwill be a report that examines the quantitative link between infrastructure development and trade \non poverty incidence and other measures of social well-being. All of these outputs, especially \nthat of the PPA, will serve as inputs to the next country strategy and program for the Lao PDR. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  In implementing this TA, ADB will work closely with the NSC and World Bank. Table 1 \nsummarizes the work-sharing arrangement of NSC, ADB, and the World Bank by identifying \nareas in which each agency will take the lead. The methodologies to be employed and the key \nactivities to be undertaken by ADB in this TA are as follows: \n(i)  Update the results of the PPA conducted in 2000 employing the methodology \ndeveloped in the first phase of this TA. Improvements to this methodology will be \nconsidered, as necessary. \n(ii)  Expand the implementation of the participatory poverty monitoring instrument \nbeyond the pilot test cases of the first phase of the TA to include poor districts \nand villages on a nationwide basis as part of the planning process. \n(iii)  Improve  the  data  management  system  developed  under  the  first  phase  to \nimprove the effectiveness of poverty monitoring. \n(iv)  Assess progress in poverty reduction, employing both qualitative and quantitative \ntechniques but focusing on the former. With the World Bank taking the lead role \non the quantitative assessment, incorporate the inputs to inform the qualitative \nassessment as required.  \n(v)  Provide  training  to  the  central,  provincial,  and  district  staff  on  designing, \ncollecting, and analyzing PPAs by expanding upon the pilot test cases of the first \nphase of the TA. \n(vi)  Conduct provincial workshops on survey instruments that include qualitative and \nquantitative methods and approaches to measure poverty. \n(vii)  Continue support initiated in the first phase to institutionalize PPA methods in \ndecision-making. \n(viii)  Conduct analysis of new and existing data sets on the relationship between \ninfrastructure development and trade on poverty reduction. \n(ix)  Conduct periodic seminars to discuss the main TA findings with Government \nofficials, academics, private sector, nongovernment organizations, and the aid \ncommunity.  \n \nC.   Cost and Financing  \n10.  The  TA  is  estimated  to  cost  $470,000  equivalent,  comprising  $326,000  in  foreign \nexchange cost and $144,000 equivalent in local currency cost. ADB will provide $400,000 \nequivalent to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $74,000 of the local currency cost. The \nTA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance \nthe remaining $70,000 equivalent of the local currency cost by providing counterpart staff, office \naccommodation, and other related services and facilities. The detailed cost estimates are given \nin Appendix 2.  \n ", "4  \nTable 1: Lao Poverty Assessment 2004/05, Outline \n \nStudies\\Subject Areas  Lead Agency \nQuantitative Analysis of Poverty   \n1.

Implementation Arrangements  \n11.  NSC will be the Executing Agency for the TA. The NSC deputy director, who will be \nresponsible for overall TA implementation, will appoint a TA manager to oversee day-to-day TA \nactivities. NSC will also provide logistical support for TA implementation. The TA manager is \nexpected to be a senior NSC officer. Qualified technical and support staff from NSC will assist \nthe TA manager. In addition to workshops and seminars, the consultants will emphasize on-the-\njob training, particularly in relation to provincial and district staff involved in implementing the \nparticipatory poverty monitoring instrument and the PPA.  \n12.  The TA is expected to commence in February 2005 and be completed by February 2006 \n(12  months).  Recognizing  country-specific  institutional  capacity  and  ownership  of \nmethodological approaches to data analyses, international and domestic consultants will be \nselected on an individual basis. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with ADB's \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. About 16 \nperson-months of international consulting and 15 person-months of domestic consulting are \nrequired. The international specialists will include a participatory social development specialist \n(12  person-months)  and  an  economic  and  social  impact  of  projects  specialist  (4  person-\nmonths). The economic and social impact of projects specialist should have a strong grounding \nin economics and quantitative poverty analysis, and preferably be familiar with the Lao PDR and \nits  database.  The  domestic  consultants  will  be a  rural  development  specialist  (12  person-\nmonths) and a data and statistical specialist (3 person-months). The outline terms of reference \nfor the TA are presented in Appendix 3. The consultants will provide (i) an inception report \nwithin 3 weeks of TA commencement outlining the detailed framework of the activities; (ii) an \ninterim report within 12 weeks of TA commencement, including data collection and preliminary \nanalysis of each task and likely directions of the final outputs; and (iii) a draft final report 12 \nweeks before TA completion. The final report will be prepared only after a tripartite review \nmeeting of the Government, ADB, and the consultants. After the report is finalized, another \ntripartite meeting between ADB, NSC, and World Bank will be held to bring the respective inputs \ntogether and finalize the synthesis report. The World Bank will have the overall responsibility for ", "    5\nproducing the synthesis report. Equipment items such as computers, software, audiovisual \nequipment, and other training materials will be procured by consultants under arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB and turned over to NSC at the end of the consulting assignment.  \nIV.
