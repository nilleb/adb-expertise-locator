During the 2002 Country Programming Mission of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nthe Government of Indonesia requested technical assistance (TA) to assist the Ministry of \nFinance (MOF) in (i) strengthening central and local public sector financial management, (ii) \nimplementing a new onlending mechanism; and (iii) establishing a prudent, comprehensive, and \nefficient  local  government  financial  information  system.  The  TA  was  included  in  2003  TA \nProgram to Indonesia under the Country Strategy and Program. The Fact-Finding Mission, \nfielded  during  10-13  March  2003,  reached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the \npurpose  and  output,  methodology  and  key  activities,  cost  estimates,  and  implementation \narrangements of the TA.1  \n \nII.   ISSUES \n2.  Rapid implementation of decentralization has proceeded remarkably smoothly although \nit  has  created  a  number  of  gaps  and  inconsistencies  in  both  the  policy  framework  and \nimplementation, particularly in intergovernmental fiscal relations. One specific area that requires \nfurther attention pertains to local government borrowing, as several policy and implementation \nissues need to be resolved. They include (i) clarification of the legal framework and introduction \nof safeguards in case of default; (ii) options for resolving loan arrears under the previous \nonlending system; (iii) introduction of internationally accepted accounting standards and sound \nfinancial management at central and local government levels; and (iv) availability of timely, \naccurate, and sufficient financial information on local governments. The reforms will support the \ndevelopment of a regional credit market in the long -term, while facilitating the flow of external \nfunds to local development in the short term. \n \n3.  The current legal framework for local government borrowing is unclear and incomplete. \nLaws 22 and 25 of 1999 supported by Government Regulation 107 of 2000 in principle provide \nmore latitude than in the past for regional2 borrowing from domestic and foreign sources.3  \nResponsibility for borrowing is placed in the hands of the local government, including the \ndecision  on  the  sources  and  currency  of  funds.  Foreign  borrowing  is  allowed,  with  the \npermission of the central Government, but without its guarantee. However, Regulation 107 also \noutlines the appropriate sources and types of regional government borrowing, the purposes to \nwhich borrowing may be put, and restricts borrowing through maximum debt-to-revenue ratios. \nThe Law on State Finances (17/2003) introduced further requirements for regional borrowing by \nspecifying regional deficit and debt limits. These limits, however, if added to national limits \nallows a total general government deficit of 9% of GDP.4 Should regions choose to borrow \nheavily utilizing these limits, given that regional revenues are expected to continue to grow, debt \nmanagement  could  emerge  as  a  major  issue  in  macroeconomic  management.  Present \nweaknesses in financial management and information constrain the ability of MOF to effectively \nmonitor and manage this risk. A ministerial decree enacted in 2001 and still in force prohibits \nregional foreign borrowing except through the central Government, but this safeguard is only an \ninterim measure.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in October 2002. \n2  In the Indonesian context, regional refers to provinces, districts, and cities. \n3 As with financial management, there are overlaps and inconsistencies between the two laws that should be \nresolved. \n4 These limits are too high and appear to be a drafting error that intended to limit general government borrowing, and \nmight be corrected in forthcoming legislation. \n ", "2   \n \n4.  A crucial aspect of the borrowing framework is rules and procedures in the event of \ndefault. The law places responsibility with local governments, and in strict interpretation allows \nlocal governments to interact directly with the lender, yet does not provide for safeguards in \ncase of default. Provision is made for the intercept of the general allocation grant provided to \nregional government in case of default on repayments to the central Government. It is not clear, \nhowever, that this intercept applies in the case of commercial lending. Even with the intercept, \ngiven the significant variations in debt service capacity of regions, this provision appears to be \ninadequate, particularly if more than one region is in default at any one time. Clear rules and \nprocedures need to be established as to what collateral regional governments can pledge, \nprocedures to be followed in the event of default, provisions for central Government intervention \nin this event, and prescribed sanctions for defaulters. \n \n5.  This is particularly important in establishing the groundwork for a regional credit market, \ngiven the poor past experience with regional borrowing. Until the end of 2002, multilateral as \nwell as central Government lending to local governments was channeled through the regional \ndevelopment accounts (RDA), with domestic sourced funds known as RPD and foreign sourced \nfunds onlent in subsidiary loan agreements (SLAs).5 Conceived as a revolving fund, the RDA \nwas intended to consolidate external and domestic funds into a single source, offering standard \nterms to local governments. However, the performance of the RDA has been unsatisfactory, \nwith at least 70% of loans in arrears.6 About two thirds of loan disbursements (Rp3,338 billion) \nhave been to local government owned enterprises (BUMD) for a total of 397 loans, while the \nremaining amount (Rp 1,776 billion) went to local governments for a total of 362 loans.7 Water \nenterprises (PDAMs) have represented most of the BUMD borrowing, with a small residual for \nservices  such  as  solid  waste  collection  and  disposal.  The  underlying  reasons  for  these \narrears\u2014including  fiscal  capacities,  governance,  and  administrative  issues\u2014require  further \ninvestigation and analysis to inform implementation of an effective new onlending mechanism.  \n \n6.  Law 25/1999 and the implementing regulations did not contain detailed provisions for \nonlending  of  foreign  loans,  which  caused  some  difficulties  for  the  processing  and \nimplementation of donor-funded development projects at local level. Ministry of Finance Decree \n35/2003 addressed this problem by providing for an interim onlending mechanism to channel \nfunding from international financial institutions to viable local government development projects. \nAlthough the decree has laid down conditions for onlending, several issues need to be resolved \nbefore it can be a prudent and effective conduit. For example, further clarifications are needed \nas to how the costs of borrowing, including foreign exchange risk, will be shared between \ncentral and local government. The legal framework remains ambiguous as to how revenue \ngenerating projects are to be defined or how funds will flow for projects that have both revenue \ngenerating  and  non-revenue  generating  components.  For  non-revenue  generating  projects \nwhere loan proceeds are passed on as grants, the principle of cost sharing has been adopted, \nbut  the  classification  of  regional  governments  according  to  fiscal  capacity  has  not  been \ncompleted. Further analysis at the policy level will assist the Government both in implementing \nDecree  35  as  an  interim  solution  and  in  devising  longer  term  mechanisms  for  regional \ngovernment  borrowing.  At  a  more  technical  level,  the  Decree  requires  that  regional \ngovernments applying for a new loan must have no existing RDA arrears, or must fully pay all \narrears and indicate such willingness in their budgets. Furthermore, those in arrears will have to \n                                                 \n5  A third category (RDI) two-step loan to state-owned enterprises. ADB TA 3214 (ADB. 1999. Improving the \nManagement of Government Onlending Operations. Manila) analyzed the RDI portfolio and its administration. \nRecommendations have been incorporated into the design of this TA. \n6  As of December 2001. \n7  This TA will be primarily concerned with loans in arrears to regional governments. The World Bank is currently \nassisting the Ministry of Finance in workouts for loans in arrears to PDAMs. \n ", "    3\nprepare a business plan acceptable to MOF prior to signing a memorandum of understanding \n(MOU) with MOF. The MOU will commit the regional government to take full responsibility for \npast  loans  and  will  document  any  restructuring  arrangements  for  arrears,  including  the \napplication of an intercept mechanism as provided by law. However, no restructuring agreement \nwill entail any debt write-offs. Assistance will be needed at both central and local level to \nimplement the provisions on existing arrears. \n \n7.  A key element of the local government fiscal framework that is critical in facilitating \nsound  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations  and  effective  local  borrowing  is  that  of  financial \nmanagement  and  accountability.  At  the  central  level,  the  Government  has  embarked  on \ncomprehensive reforms to modernize financial management. In August 1998, the Financial \nManagement Reform Committee (KPMK)8 was appointed to draft relevant new legislation and \nreform strategies. In September 2000, the Government introduced in Parliament three new laws \non state finances, state treasury, and audit of state finances\u2013accountability. The three laws \ncontain general principles on government budgetary processes and financial management, and \nserve as a legal framework for reforms in public expenditure management. In July 2002, KPMK \npublished  a  white  paper  entitled  Reform  of  the  Public  Financial  Management  System  in \nIndonesia: Principles and Strategy. In March 2003, the first of the three laws, the State Finance \nLaw,  was  passed  by  Parliament.  Decentralization  added  a  new  dimension  to  financial \nmanagement reform in the form of 3789 semiautonomous regional governments, which are \ngenerally inexperienced in financial management and reporting, yet will have to comply with the \nthree new laws and new accounting standards. Local governments currently prepare simple \ncash-based  financial  reports,  which  comprise  statements  of  (i)  receipts,  (ii)  development \nexpenditure, and (iii) routine expenditure. It is difficult to introduce sound governance principles \nand to assess creditworthiness because (i) cash balances are neither disclosed nor reconciled, \n(ii) financial assets and liabilities (e.g., outstanding loans) are not disclosed, and (iii) other \nassets and liabilities are not disclosed (e.g., fixed assets, employee benefits, etc).  \n \n8.  Assessing and monitoring the fiscal and financial status of local government, either by \nMOF or by potential creditors, require consistently timely and accurate information. Similarly, \nlocal  government  managers  themselves  require  sound  financial  information  to  improve \nprioritization and resource management. Thus, it is critical that regional governments produce \ntimely  financial  statements  that  comply  with  uniform,  internationally  recognized  accounting \nstandards and are readily available to stakeholders. Given the growing proportion of regional to \ntotal government expenditure, such information is also essential for producing consolidated \ngeneral government financial information. Uniform accounting standards for local governments \nare central to improved public sector financial management. Law 25 of 1999 and government \nregulation PP11 of 2001 give MOF the authority to develop and maintain the regional financial \ninformation system (SIKD) and to issue regulations that will ensure the efficient implementation \nof  the  system,  including  the  flow  into  the  system  of  timely,  relevant,  comparable, \nunderstandable, and reliable information. \n \n9.  Ongoing coordination with development partners is ensured through a Working Group \non Decentralization, under the consultation process of the Consultative Group for Indonesia. \nWhile other partners are active in related areas such as developing accounting standards, \ntreasury  systems  and  information  systems,  ADB  is  the  only  institution  directly  addressing \nonlending issues. This TA is focusing on conceptualizing framework for regional development \n                                                 \n8  Komite Penyempuraan Manajemen Keuangan. \n9  As of 31 December 2002. \n ", "4   \n \nfinancing and enhanced financial management. It builds on previous and ongoing assistance \nfrom ADB and other development partners. \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.   Purpose and Output \n10.  The TA will prepare a framework for regional government financing from both domestic \nand  international  sources  and  recommend  restructuring  of  supporting  institutions.  This \nframework will help support the designing of future programs of ADB\u2019s activities in the area of \nlocal government financing.10 As a result, financial management at the central and local levels \nand flows of timely financial information will improve. \n \nB.   Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The first objective will be to analyze options for implementing an interim onlending \nmechanism in accordance with Kepmen 35 of 2003. The analysis will include management of \nloans in arrears, options for an equitable and fair mechanism for restructuring of arrears, and \nlegal advice to MOF for the revision of Law 25 and PP 107. The second objective will be to \ndesign and pilot harmonized financial management practices at central and local level. A \nnumber of areas for further support have emerged through the development of the Corporate \nPlan11 within MOF, other central government agencies and regional governments in Indonesia. \nThe  third  objective  will  be  to  facilitate  availability  of  timely,  accurate,  consistent  local \ngovernment financial information. This component will be developed in close cooperation with \nthe World Bank.  \n \n12.  In order to meet the first objective, the TA will provide technical advice to support the \nimplementation of a new onlending mechanism with the purpose of channeling credits from the \nInternational Financial Institutions (IFIs) through the Central Government to LGUs. The project \nwill assist the Government in resolving loans in arrears so as to widen the number of LGUs \neligible for new onlending operations. The new onlending mechanism will be designed to grant \nadequate loan terms and flexibly allocate foreign currency risks in line with the fiscal capacity of \nthe  LGUs.  This  component  includes  advice  to  the  Government  for  reforms  of  the  legal \nframework for local government borrowing. \n \n13.  Under  the  second  objective  a  time-bound  implementation  plan  will  be  prepared  for \nimproving financial management and maintaining consistency between central Government and \nlocal government practices. Systems will be pilot-tested in MOF as well as in a large number of \nfinance departments of local governments. Four sub-projects will be tested: (i) strengthening \norganizational development and human resource capacity related to financial management; (ii) \nstrengthening  economic  policy  and  fiscal  evaluation  capacity;  (iii)  strengthening  financial \nmanagement  and  control;  and  (iv)  strengthening  accounting  and  financial  reporting  by \nimplementing new government accounting standards in line with international standards. \n \n14.  In the area of financial information improvement, the TA will design a local government \nFIS that will (i) improve information regularity, timeliness, and quality; (ii) support external audits; \n(iii) shorten the data consolidation time frame and free up resources for analysis; (iv) increase \n                                                 \n10 The 2003 Indonesia Country Strategy and Program Update includes a Local Government Finance Pilot Project and \na Local Government Finance Sector Development Program. \n11 Prepared by the FMRC with support from ADB TA 3764 (ADB. 2001.

This will entail the \ndevelopment of financial reporting policies and standards, valuing local government assets and \nliabilities, developing methodologies and systems for providing consistent local government \nfinancial information and developing FIS for BUMDs. \n \n15.  Workshops and seminars will be held for each component to disseminate the findings \nand identify regional governments willing to participate in developing the different components.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $750,000 equivalent, comprising $335,000 in \nforeign exchange and $415,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $600,000 equivalent covering the total foreign exchange cost and $265,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide $150,000 \nequivalent to finance counterpart staff, office facilities, and other expenditures (Appendix 2).  \n \nD.   Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA Executing Agency will be the Secretariat General of MOF. The implementing \nagencies will be the Directorate General for Central and Regional Fiscal Balance (DGCRFB), \nthe Directorate General of Financial Institutions (DGFI), and the Agency for the State Finance \nand Accounting (BAKUN) of MOF. About 11 person-months of international consulting services \n(individual consultants) will be required. The international consultants will be experts in debt \nrestructuring, public financial management, and financial information systems (Appendix 3). The \ninternational consultants will associate with domestic consultants who will provide about 42 \nperson-months  of  consulting  services  in  public  sector  accounting,  public  sector  financial \nmanagement, debt restructuring, and law. ADB will engage the consultants in accordance with \nits Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for \nengaging domestic consultants. The TA will be implemented over 23 months, from December \n2003 to October 2005. \n \nIV.       THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Indonesia for the Local Government Financing Project, and hereby reports \nthis action to the Board. \n \n ", "6   Appendix 1          \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \nGoal       \n       \nTo strengthen  (cid:131) Pro-poor  (cid:131) Loan data from  (cid:131) Continued commitment \ndecentralization and  development policies  Directorate Financial  and participation by \ngood governance  enacted by regional  Institutions  central and regional \nthrough enhanced  governments    governments \naccess by regional     \ngovernments to  (cid:131) Proportion of  (cid:131) Regional government \nfinancing for  overseas  financial statements  \ndevelopment projects.   development  (cid:131) ADB project \nassistance for  performance audit \nregional development  (cid:131) Government decrees \nprojects increases   \nfrom 2002 baseline   \n(cid:131) Implementation of \nnew onlending \nmechanism \n(cid:131) Increased knowledge \nand skills of regional \ntreasury staff \n \nPurpose       \n       \nTo facilitate the  (cid:131) Amendments to laws  (cid:131) Reports of the  (cid:131) Continued commitment \ndevelopment of a  and decrees on  Directorate General  and support of national \nregional credit market  regional borrowing  Budget and Fiscal  government \nby:  (cid:131) Adherence to cash  Balance  (cid:131) Willingness of regional \n(i) clarifying the legal  accounting    governments to \nframework;  standards by 2005    participate as pilot \n(ii) strengthening  (cid:131) At least 50% of  (cid:131) Regional government  projects \ncentral and local  regional  audited financial  (cid:131) Agreement between \nfinancial  governments comply  statements  MOHA and MOF on \nmanagement  with financial  (cid:131) Reports from  areas of jurisdiction \n(iii) defining options for  reporting  Directorate General  (cid:131) Participation by civil \nresolving existing  requirements of  Treasury  society and other \nloan arrears;  State Finance Law  (cid:131) Asian Development  stakeholders \n(iv)  improving the  by 2006  Bank (ADB) project   \nquality and  (cid:131) At least 75% of  completion report \ntimeliness of  regional  (cid:131) Copies of regional \nregional  governments submit  budgets \ngovernment  information to MOF \nfinancial  on time \ninformation.
