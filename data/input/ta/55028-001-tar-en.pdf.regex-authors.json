INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will assist the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) respond to the urgent need to improve the quality of urbanization in counties and \ncounty-level  cities  to  become  sustainable  and  inclusive  by  leveraging  urban  development \ncooperation mechanisms of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Program.1 The TA will build \ncapacity and strengthen institutions in national and local urban and related sectors.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Urbanization in the People\u2019s Republic of China. The PRC has rapidly urbanized since \n1978 when reform began and the country started to open up. The urbanization rate was 17.9% in \n1978 and reached 60.6% in 2019; the PRC\u2019s Fourteenth Five-Year Plan targets 65.0% by 2025.3 \nUrbanization was the critical driver of economic growth, bringing remarkable prosperity. However, \nrapid,  land-based,  and  supply-driven  urbanization  compromised  the  quality  of  life  and \ndevelopment, causing social inequality and environmental degradation. The PRC launched a \npeople-centered urbanization plan in 2014.4 It aimed to optimize urbanization patterns; make \ncities more sustainable; and promote urban\u2013rural integration, especially the orderly integration of \nrural migrants into urban residents. Despite the achievements and the shift in focus to people-\ncentered urbanization, challenges remain.5 Many rural dwellers migrated and became urban \nresidents, but essential urban services and infrastructure to accommodate them, especially social \nsecurity, are still inadequate. Industries from the PRC\u2019s developed east coast area have shifted \nto some inland cities, but skills development in inland cities does not necessarily match the needs \nof relocated industries. Local governments rely on land-based development revenue, which \nresults in unsustainable government debt and urban expansion. Mitigating climate risks and \nenvironmental degradation require a further shift from traditional linear and resource-intensive \nurbanization. \n \n3.  Urbanization of counties and county-level cities. A 2020 National Development and \nReform Commission (NDRC) circular identified counties and county-level cities as critical players \nin  the  urbanization  process.6 The  circular  recognized  the  lack  of  capacity,  services,  and \ninfrastructure in counties and county-level cities to ensure quality public services, a livable \nenvironment, and job skills support, especially for rural\u2013urban migrants. The coronavirus disease \n(COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 exposed the counties\u2019 and county-level cities\u2019 vulnerability in \ncontrolling epidemics because of lack of capacity and environmental and sanitation facilities. The \ncircular listed 17 task areas to improve county-level public, environmental, health, and industrial \n \n1  The GMS comprises Cambodia, the PRC (Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Yunnan Province), the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

The Fourteenth Five-Year Plan, which continues to promote people-centered urbanization, \nidentifies counties and county-level cities as critical drivers of urbanization.7 In response to the \nFourteenth Five-Year Plan, NDRC assigned key tasks to relevant ministries to promote county-\nlevel urbanization.8 \n \n4.  Urbanization in the People\u2019s Republic of China border areas in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion. The PRC has participated in the GMS Program since its establishment in 1992 to \nstrengthen economic cooperation and development among GMS countries. The PRC\u2019s Guangxi \nZhuang Autonomous Region (Guangxi), which borders Viet Nam, and Yunnan Province (Yunnan), \nwhich borders Myanmar, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Viet Nam, are part of the GMS \nProgram. About 51.5% of Guangxi\u2019s and 48.9% of Yunnan\u2019s population are categorized as urban, \nproportions that are lower than the national average of 60.6%.9 Development and urbanization in \nthe border region vary.10 More than 30.0% of Guangxi\u2019s and Yunnan\u2019s population comprise ethnic \nminorities, many living in autonomous counties in the border areas. The development pattern, \ndirection, and potential of county-level urbanization in Guangxi and Yunnan should be examined, \nconsidering factors such  as  interaction  with  neighboring GMS countries  and  differences  in \ngeographical features, economic activities, infrastructure, ethnic groups, and social conditions. \n \n5.  Challenges and prospects facing urban development cooperation under the Greater \nMekong Subregion  Program.  The  GMS  frameworks  have  been  focusing  on  better  urban \neconomic and infrastructure integration for regional corridor development and cooperation among \nGMS countries.11 Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2013financed studies, capacity building activities, \nand loan projects have been implemented, responding to the strategic focus on border city \ndevelopment projects in the PRC and corridor town development projects in Cambodia, the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam.12 The PRC established and has been \nleading the organization of the annual GMS Governor\u2019s Forum, which aims to tap the potential of \nlocal economies to contribute to developing the GMS and to improve economic opportunities. \nHowever, there is considerable unmet potential to leverage regional cooperation in the GMS to \nstrengthen urban development in participating countries and provinces. The COVID-19 situation, \nwhich started in 2020, reemphasized the importance of regional public health and health risk \nmitigation  measures  across  borders.  However,  although  the  program  gave  GMS  countries \n \n7  Government of the PRC. 2021.

County-level cities that \nhost national-level border economic cooperation zones, bonded areas, and ports, such as Dongxing (adjacent to \nMong Cai, Viet Nam) and Pingxiang, show a high urbanization rate of more than 72.0%. Other counties on the \nGuangxi\u2013Viet Nam border show urbanization rates as low as 28.2%. In Yunnan, the provincial capital Kunming\u2019s \nurbanization rate is 73.6%, while border areas\u2019 average urbanization rate is relatively low at 44.6%, including areas \non the Myanmar border at about 34.3%. \n11 ADB. 2012.

Progress in urban development is less significant. Persistent bottlenecks remain in \nimplementing collaborative  approaches,  such  as  building GMS countries\u2019  capacity to make \ndecisions and take on responsibilities, deepening the focus on regional public goods, finding \nbalance and integrated approaches between hard and soft interventions, and seeking greater \nengagement of the private sector.13 Through its new strategic framework, the GMS Program not \nonly encourages a holistic approach to planning green, inclusive, resilient, and competitive cities \nbut also has an improved spatial approach to development as a new priority. The new approach \nis to exploit the agglomeration effects of urbanization, linking cities across borders through \nincreased cross-border trade, rising tourism, and agriculture value chains.14 The TA will propose \npotential public or private financing projects that support regional public goods from urban and \nhuman capital development. \n \n6.  Insufficient capacity and knowledge of central and local officials on county-level \nurbanization and cross-border intercity regional cooperation. The PRC aims to propose \nviable and sustainable GMS projects for urban development and requires increased knowledge \nand capacity to support them.15 Although the PRC was given opportunities to promote county-\nlevel urbanization as a national priority and cross-border intercity cooperation under the GMS \nProgram, national and local officials lack the capacity to take advantage of the opportunities. \nGuangxi and Yunnan can benefit from new development opportunities associated with flows of \ngoods, services, and people while overcoming unfavorable conditions such as remote locations, \nsmall  markets,  insufficient support from  national  government,  and  less developed  transport \ninfrastructure.16 Analysis  and  capacity  building  will  enable  the  PRC  to  communicate  with \nneighboring GMS countries on jointly developing integrated, sustainable, and mutually beneficial \nurban development projects. \n \n7.  Alignment with ADB\u2019s strategic priorities. The TA aligns with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 \noperational priorities. The TA aims to contribute to pillar 3 of operational priority 7 by strengthening \nnational and local (provincial and county-level cities\u2019 and counties\u2019) capacities to produce regional \npublic  goods,  such  as  livable  urban  development,  sanitation facilities, health systems,  and \ntransboundary sustainable use and protection of resources.17 The TA will support the existing \nGMS coordination mechanisms, especially by boosting the capacity of the PRC to strengthen its \npolicies and practices on collaborating with its neighbors. The TA aligns with the priorities of the \ncountry  partnership strategy for  the  PRC,  2021\u20132025,  which  emphasizes support to  policy \ndialogue,  knowledge  sharing,  and  regional  public  goods  through  regional  cooperation  and \nintegration initiatives, including in the GMS;18 strategic framework pillar 3 (capacity development \nin urban planning and management) of the GMS Urban Development Strategic Framework, \n \n13 Independent Evaluation Department. 2021.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: people-centered urbanization in counties and \ncounty-level  cities  promoted  (footnote  7),  and  a  holistic  approach  to  develop  livable  cities \nsupported (footnote 14). The TA will have the following outcome: policies on and project designs \nfor county-level sustainable urbanization leveraging GMS cooperation improved.21 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Practical policy recommendations to implement county-level urbanization \ncoordinated with Greater Mekong Subregion initiatives developed. The output will conduct \nanalysis to develop evidence, propose policies, and strengthen institutions that take advantage \nof the characteristics of Guangxi and Yunnan to leverage the GMS Program, improve county-\nlevel urbanization and explore approaches and methodologies, and jointly develop integrated and \nsustainable GMS urban projects. The development pattern, direction, and potential of county-\nlevel urbanization in Guangxi and Yunnan will be examined through surveys, considering factors \nsuch as interaction with neighboring GMS countries and differences in geographical features, \neconomic activities, infrastructure, ethnic groups, and social conditions. The targeted survey \nlocations are in the counties in Guangxi and Yunnan; the focus of the surveys will be detailed and \ndetermined at project inception. A possible approach would be to conduct spatial analysis seeking \nto achieve agglomeration effects of urbanization for border areas. The PRC is promoting people-\ncentered urbanization; therefore, the surveys may also focus on human resources and vocational \nskills development for rural migrants who may seek employment in urban areas. This output will \nbe based on three broad tasks: (i) prepare field survey reports, (ii) develop a comprehensive \nreport on county-level urbanization in Guangxi and Yunnan and potential for GMS urbanization \ncooperation,  and  (iii)  draft  a  policy  brief  for  both  national  and  provincial  levels  to  guide \nimplementation of county-level urbanization leveraging the GMS cooperation mechanism. \n \n10.  Output 2: Policy makers\u2019 capacity on county-level urbanization and Greater Mekong \nSubregion  cooperation  strengthened.  The  output  will  include  workshops,  seminars,  and \nknowledge products based on output 1 analysis on county urbanization and GMS cooperation. \nThe TA will strengthen institutions by developing capacity among national and local policy makers \nand conducting training and capacity building activities for those involved in county urbanization \nand  regional cooperation.  The  TA  will support  preparing materials for representatives from \nGuangxi,  Yunnan,  NDRC,  and  related  parties  to  propose  practical  collaborative  working \nmechanisms, initiatives, and projects with GMS countries at working group meetings and events. \n \nC.
