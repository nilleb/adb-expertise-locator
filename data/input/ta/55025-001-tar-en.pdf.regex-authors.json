INTRODUCTION\n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will help the Government of the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) respond to rapid population aging by undertaking research and \ndeveloping national policy tools and action plans related to aging and elderly care. The TA is \naligned with strategic priority 3 (aging society and health security) of the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  country  partnership  strategy  for  the  PRC,  2021\u20132025,  which  aims  to  address  key \nchallenges in adapting to an aging society.1\nII.  ISSUES\n2. The number and proportion of older people as a share of the population in the PRC is\nrapidly growing. Demographic estimates indicate that the country will move from an aging to aged\nsociety by 2027,2 and the proportion of people aged 60 and above is expected to increase from\n18.7% in 2020 to 35.0% by 2050\u2014turning the population into one of the oldest in the world at a\nfast pace.3 A falling fertility rate, smaller families, and longer life expectancy have decreased the\nproportion of young people and increased the proportion of older people.4 These demographic\nchanges will have major economic and social impacts on the country\u2019s labor force, health care,\nelderly care, and pension systems. At the same time, aging provides opportunities for economic\ndevelopment. Rising disposable income and assets among the older population will create\ndemand for goods and services and will catalyze growth in pension and insurance funds. Older\npeople have substantial potential to contribute to sustainable economic growth as part of a\nmultigenerational workforce, which will require development of age-friendly and healthy aging\npolicies,  including  more  flexible  work  and  retirement  options;  age-friendly  workplaces;  and\nretraining, reskilling, and upskilling. These policies will help ensure that older workers can fully\nparticipate in the PRC\u2019s economic activities.\n3. Aging well is a lifelong process that can be supported by advancements in public health\nand elderly care services and systems (ECSS), better financial services, use of innovative\ntechnologies, and the development of healthy and age-friendly living conditions. Older people\nrepresent an increasingly important consumer force, but they have specific needs for financial\nservices and face various challenges in accessing and using financial services and systems.\nPolicymakers  must  consider  these  needs  to  achieve  sustainable  financial  inclusion  that  is\nsupported by financial protection and education, and responsive financial services and products.\nFinancial inclusion will contribute to greater financial system stability, reduce pressure on public\npension schemes, reduce old-age poverty, and improve intergenerational equality.5 There is a\nneed to develop policies and guides for financial institutions that will help them strengthen\nfinancial and digital literacy, support lifetime financial planning, harness inclusive technologies,\nand encourage multisector participation to address the needs of older people.\n4. Family support in the PRC has traditionally played a major role in providing care for the\nelderly, but families are increasingly unable to meet the basic needs of older people. The\n1  ADB. 2021. Country Partnership Strategy: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2021\u20132025\u2014Toward High-Quality, Green \nDevelopment. Manila. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 November \n2021. \n2  The World Health Organization defines an \u201caging society\u201d as one in which more than 7% of the population is 65 years \nor older, and an \u201caged society\u201d as a society in which more than 14% of the population is 65 years or older. \n3  ADB. 2021.

Manila. \n4  The United Nations defines an older person as someone who is over 60 years of age.  \n5  Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. 2019. G20 \nFukuoka Policy Priorities on Aging and Financial Inclusion. Fukuoka. ", "2 \ndevelopment of an efficient national elderly care system is a key priority. Investing in better ECSS \nwill help the government increase the quantity and improve the quality of ECSS. To achieve these \ngoals, there is a need to (i) assess the challenges to improving the elderly care system, including \nupdating the national elderly care guidelines, improving system quality, and integrating elderly \ncare services; (ii) estimate the required investments in land, labor, capital, technology, and \ninformation systems for elderly care; and (iii) develop the government investment program and \nrecommendations for improving the quality of ECSS. \n5. Innovative technologies have the potential to improve well-being, health care, and elderly\ncare support. The emerging technologies range from assistive robots, artificial intelligence-\nenabled health monitoring smart applications, sensors and wearables, new pharmaceutical drug\nrelease mechanisms, portable diagnostics systems, voice-activated devices, intelligent homes,\nand many other technological solutions to provide support and services for older people. At the\nsame time, digital inclusiveness and closing the digital divide for older people have become critical\nchallenges  to  address.  Developing  modern  and  comprehensive  national  policy  tools  and\nstrategies on aging requires in-depth analysis of the extent and impact of digital exclusion and\noptions to improve digital inclusion.\n6. Urbanization is a global trend that has rapidly expanded in the PRC. As the cities are\ngrowing,  their  share  of  population  above  60  years  is  also  increasing.6 Age-friendly  urban\ndevelopment and age-friendly cities are important to tap the potential of older people. There is a\nneed to (i) analyze the development trends and regional distribution of the working-age and older\npopulations in the cities to meet the needs of the various age groups; (ii) develop guidance for\nand monitor the development of a conducive environment for healthy aging, and other aspects of\nage-friendly cities; (iii) carry out nationwide evaluation and develop a system to evaluate a city\u2019s\nage-friendliness; and (iv) assess the scale of investments and government fiscal expenditures\nrequired for the development of age-friendly cities.\n7. On average, women have lower lifetime earnings, are less digitally and financially literate,\nuse fewer formal financial services including bank accounts, and live longer than men.7 They\noften receive smaller pension payments than men, partly because women get paid less during\ntheir working years and lose compensation when they leave the labor force for caring duties such\nas raising children. Therefore, when women reach old age, they are poorer, less educated, more\nfinancially and digitally excluded, and are more likely to have unmet care needs than men.8 The\nTA will focus on the needs of older women, who have lower lifetime earnings, have higher levels\nof digital and financial exclusion, yet are also more likely to have unmet care needs, while\nsimultaneously acting as the primary caregivers in the family.\n8. The Government of the PRC has been responding to these challenges by developing\nnational policies and programs to address aging. The PRC\u2019s Fourteenth Five-Year Plan, 2021\u2013\n2025  aims  to  address  population  aging  and  promote  long-term  balanced  population\ndevelopment.9 The plan calls for implementation of the national strategy to improve welfare\npolicies, develop elderly care services, and raise the statutory retirement age (footnotes 8\u201310).\n6  N.

The TA will build on ADB\u2019s aging-related projects, experiences, lessons learned, and\nongoing cooperation with various agencies in the PRC.13 The lessons from the aging-related\nprojects financed by ADB and other international organizations highlight the importance of\nfocusing on community and home-based elderly care services; improving coordination and\ncooperation of government agencies in charge of the elderly care policies, systems and services;\npromoting close cooperation between the social and healthcare institutions; and investing in\ndeveloping human resources capacity and knowledge. The TA will add value by helping the\ngovernment develop and implement a national policy framework for aging-related sectors that will\nenhance the support from ADB and other donors to the development of the PRC\u2019s ECSS. The TA\nwill support Strategy 2030\u2019s operational priority 1 (addressing remaining poverty and reducing\ninequalities), operational priority 2 (accelerating progress in gender equality), and operational\npriority 6 (strengthening governance and institutional capacity).14\nIII.
