In response to the absence of comparative information on water utilities in the\nAsian and Pacific region, the Bank published the Water Utilities Data Book - Asian and\nPacific Region in November 1993.1 This presented mostly 1990 data from 38 water utilities in\n23 developing member countries (DMCs). It has been extremely well received by DMC\ngovernments, water utilities,2 consultants, and aid institutions and has been extensively used\nby Bank staff and others in the water supply sector.\n2. Through this technical assistance (TA), the Bank will prepare a Second Water\nUtilities Data Book (SWUDB) for the Asian and Pacific Region, 3 to be published in the fourth\nquarter of 1997. It will include 1995 data from about 50 water utilities in about 30 DMCs. 4 The\ninformation to be provided in the SWUDB will be of use to governments and water sector\nplanners for the rest of the 1990s and the start of the next century.\nBACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n3. Within the region, among the DMCs, there prevail among water utilities,\ninefficiencies in managing the distribution of water (often 50 percent of water is unaccounted\nfor) and in providing a safe, reliable water supply service to consumers (e.g., few cities\nprovide 24-hour service). Reviews of Bank experience in this sector have highlighted that\noperation and maintenance (O&M) is often heavily underfunded, and O&M activities and staff\nare not always given due recognition. The SWUDB will provide a basis for making cross-\ncountry and subregional comparisons, which will facilitate policy review and serve as a tool to\nimprove capacity building and O&M in water utilities. By sharing information, the SWUDB will\nfoster regional cooperation among DMC5. It will also help to establish standards for improved\nwater distribution and better service to consumers. In addition to some new narrative features\nin this SWUDB, which will provide helpful background to the data presented, an important\ninclusion will be data on the unit costs of development.\n4. The SWUDB will also look at trends that have occurred in the water supply\nsector over the last five years by comparing the data incorporated in the first Data Book with\nthe 1995 data. This in turn will indicate areas needing special attention in certain DMCs, some\nof which can be addressed under future Bank-financed projects.\nPrepared under TA No. 5488-REG: Preparation of a Water Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific\nRegion for $135000, approved on 20 March 1992.\nA good example of its use by a utility is in justification of modifications to tariffs and tariff structures when\napplying for government approval.\nThe TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in May 1996.\nIn addition to the 23 original DMCs, surveys will be made of utilities in the balance of the DMCs. In\ngeneral, the largest utilities in a DMC will be chosen, as these represent the more advanced ones.\nThe first Data Book included (i) utility and city water supply profiles, (ii) regional profiles comparing\nimportant water supply parameters in various utilities, and (iii) an executive summary of the findings of the\nData Book and comments thereon.", "III.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objectives\n5. The SWUDB will provide operating data on the water utilities in the Asian and\nPacific region. Through use by the utilities, governments, consultants, United Nations\nagencies, and finance institutions, and as a basis for the design and implementation of policy\nreform, it is expected to provide improvements in the efficiency of managing water distribution\nand in providing a better water supply service to consumers. The result is expected to be\nmore sustainable development and more efficient use of development funds.\nB.\t Scope\n6. The scope of the TA includes collection of data 1 from about 50 utilities in about\n30 DMCs. It will involve clarifications, collation, presentation, and comparative analysis of the\ndata, and editing and printing of the SWUDB. To provide significance to, understanding of,\nand perspective to the data, the SWUDB will include the following new features: (i) a summary\nof the Bank's policy in the water supply sector; (ii) examples of best practices in ten water\nutilities; (iii) an overview of public-private partnerships and examples of model contracts; (iv)\nfeatures on service to the urban poor, O&M, including reduction of unaccounted for water\n(UFW), and capacity building; (v) results of and commentary on consumer surveys in water\nutilities; and (vi) a comparison of key parameters between the first and second Data Books.\nThese new features respond particularly to the Bank's medium-term strategic objectives and\ndevelopments in the sector that have occurred following publication of the first Data Book,\nincluding the Bank's Regional Consultation Workshop on Water Resources Policy in May\n1996.2 As with the original, this SWUDB will present the statistical data in two modes, first by\nwater utility and second by regional comparison of parameters. Commentary will be provided\non the data, and some conclusions and recommendations given. Outline terms of reference\nfor consulting services are in Appendix 1.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n7.\t The total cost of the TA is estimated at $400,000 equivalent. The TA will be\nfinanced by the Bank on a grant basis. Details of the cost estimates are given in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n8. The TA will be implemented through one principal domestic consultant to be\nrecruited in the Philippines (6 person-months); 30 DMC domestic consultants (50 person-\nmonths equivalent); and one international consultant (2 person-months). Bank staff are\nexpected to provide an input of about four person-months. Secretarial services of 12 person-\nmonths will also be required for the TA. Computer equipment and software will be purchased\nData will include, infer al/a, information on institutions, water production, consumer service, management,\ntariffs, and O&M.\nThe workshop concluded that it would be useful to the DMCs if the Bank could prepare an overview of\npublic-private partnerships in the water supply sector, including model contracts.\nThe additional costs of this TA compared with that for the first Data Book are associated with collecting\nmore data from more utilities, a greater participatory approach, including consumer surveys and\ninternational consultant inputs on public-private partnerships.", "for the TA and become the property of the Bank's Water Supply, Urban Development and\nHousing Division (West) on completion. It is anticipated that the TA will commence in August\n1996 and be completed in November 1997. The approach to implementation is based on\nlessons learned from the preparation of the first Data Book, the most important being the need\nto use a principal domestic consultant recruited in the Philippines, rather than an international\nconsultant, for undertaking the bulk of the work in Manila. Domestic consultants in each of the\nDMCs will be identified by the subject utilities, as was done for the first Data Book. The\ninternational consultant will be an individual to be engaged by the Bank.\n9. The first phase of the work, which will be mostly the responsibility of the\nprincipal domestic consultant, will involve (I) a two-day participatory workshop in Manila for\nrepresentatives of about ten water utilities, as well as concerned Bank staff; (ii) design of water\nutility and consumer survey questionnaires; (iii) recruitment of DMC domestic consultants (on a\nlump sum basis) for the collection of data and undertaking consumer surveys; and (iv)\ncommunication with the domestic consultants. This phase is expected to take about four\nmonths.\n10. The second phase will involve data collation and presentation under two modes:\n(i) water utility and (ii) regional comparison of parameters, and will include comparisons with\n1990 (or other) data recorded in the first Data Book. This phase, which will also be organized\nby the principal domestic consultant, is expected to take about three months.\n11. The third phase of the work will involve an international consultant providing an\nup-to-date global overview of public-private partnerships in the water supply sector 1 and\nexamples of model contracts. At the same time, Bank staff will be preparing the sections of\nthe SWUDB on Bank policy, best practices, and special features, as well as providing\ncommentary on data presented in the SWUDB. This phase is expected to take about three\nmonths.\n12. The final phase will involve editing, desktop publishing, printing, and distribution\nof the SWUDB, followed by a capacity-building workshop2 for representatives of about 25\nDMC water utilities and concerned Bank staff, to be held at the Bank. This phase is expected\nto take a further five months.\nJV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n13. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved\nthe provision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the\nequivalent of $400,000 for the Second Water Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific\nRegion, and hereby reports such action to the Board.\nThese include (i) contracting out certain operations (e.g., meter replacement); (ii) short-term water\ndistribution management contracts for towns or zones of cities; (iii) Build-own-operate or Build-own-\noperate-transfer bulk supply contracts and (iv) long-term concession contracts for lease of assets,\noperation of facilities, and rehabilitation and expansion of the production and distribution system.\nThe purpose of the workshop is to ensure that the utilities are aware of the significant findings of the Data\nBook and how it may be used as a monitoring and guidance tool in the future. The workshop will be\nlimited to those utilities having business with the Bank or other external financing institutions.", "Appendix 1\nOUTLINE TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTANTS\nA.\t Principal Domestic Consultant\n1. The consultant will be required to provide a total of 6 months of input over a period of\n12 months, commencing in August 1996.The work will involve constant liaison and\ncoordination with the Bank staff responsible for the technical assistance (TA). The consultant\nwill contribute to the design of the water utility and consumer survey questionnaires. The main\nfeature of the consultant's work will be communication with the domestic consultants appointed\nin the participating countries regarding data collection and clarifications. The consultant will\ncollate the data and present it both directly (by water utility) and comparatively (by parameters\nor performance indicators). The assistance of the consultant will be needed for the\nparticipatory workshop (at the start of the TA) and capacity-building workshop (at the end of\nthe TA). A further task of the consultant will be to edit the Second Water Utilities Data Book\n(SWUDB) before desktop publishing and printing.\nB.\t Domestic Consultants\n2. The task of each domestic consultant will be first to assist the water utility to complete\nthe questionnaire on the water utility, and second to conduct a random survey of 100 domestic\nconsumers using the Bank-supplied questionnaire. For implementation of the consumer\nsurvey, the consultant is expected to hire university students. All communications and\nclarifications on the data contained in the two completed questionnaires will be made by the\nBank through the designated domestic consultant, who will be remunerated on a lump sum\nbasis for the entire assignment. To the extent possible, communications will be via electronic\nmail.\nC.\t International Consultant (Private Sector)\n3. The consultant will be required ideally in the sixth month of the TA to draft model\ncontracts for public-private partnerships in water supply, including (i) bulk supply; (ii) short-term\nmanagement of production and distribution; (iii) long-term concession for lease and\nmaintenance of assets; management of operation and maintenance (O&M); and rehabilitation\nand expansion of the water supply system; and (iv) private sector participation in contracts for\nundertaking discrete elements of O&M (e.g., water meter replacement or billing and collection).\nThe model contracts will be based on examples that have been field tested.\n4. The consultant will prepare a global overview of the development of public-private\nsector partnerships in the water supply sector over the last ten years, making reference to\nwell-known case studies, and make conclusions from the overview as to preferred approaches\nin the future. The draft model contracts and overview will be presented to the Bank for review\nand comment before finalization. The consultant will visit the Bank for that purpose during the\nseventh week of the assignment.\n(Reference in text: page 2, para 6)", "5\nAppendix 2\nCOST ESTIMATES\n($'000)\n\t\nItem Cost\n1.
