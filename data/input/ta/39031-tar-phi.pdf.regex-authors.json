INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Philippines has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto  provide  advisory  technical  assistance  (TA)  for  formulating  a  strategy  for  sustainable \naquaculture development for poverty reduction.1 The Fact-Finding Mission to prepare the TA \nwas  intermittently  fielded  on  22  August\u201314  September  2005.  The  Mission  reached \nunderstanding with the Government on the design of the TA including the impact and outcome, \nmethodology  and  key  activities,  cost  estimates  and  financing,  and  implementation \narrangements. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA is included in \nADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program (2005\u20132007): Philippines.   \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Philippines ranks among the top 15 fish-producing countries in the world. In 2004, \ntotal fisheries production in the Philippines was 3.9 million metric tons of fish, crustaceans, \nmollusks,  and  seaweeds.  The  Philippines  is  the  second  biggest  producer  of  seaweeds, \ncontributing 0.7 million tons or 6.6% of the world production of 10.5 million tons. In 2002, the \nfisheries industry contributed 2.2% of the gross domestic product in current prices.  \n \n3.  The fisheries industry employs around 1 million people or 5% of the country\u2019s labor \nforce. Around 26% of these people are engaged in aquaculture,2 68% in municipal and small-\nscale  fisheries,  and  6%  in  commercial  fisheries.  Of  the  total  fisheries  production  in  2003, \naquaculture contributed the highest share of 40.2% followed by commercial and municipal \nfisheries at 30.7% and 29.1%, respectively. Total fishery production increased at an average \nannual rate of 2.5% between 1990 and 2002. Most of the increase was due to large increases in \naquaculture production (more than 6% annual production increase over this period). There have \nbeen  modest  increases  in  commercial  capture  fisheries  (2.5%  per  year  increase  over  the \nperiod).  Overall fishery sector growth in 2003 was 7.4% compared with 6.5% in 2002, showing \nsubstantially higher growth rates than the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (MTPDP, \n2001\u20132004) targets of 4.8% and 3.2%, respectively.  \n \n4.  Aquaculture has a long history in the Philippines, starting with the traditional, low-density \nculture of milkfish in ponds and evolving into more sophisticated technology-based systems for \nthe  culture  of  various  species  of  fish,  shrimps,  mollusks,  and  seaweeds.  In  terms  of \ncommodities, seaweeds contributed 68% to aquaculture production in 2003 (by raw weight), \nfollowed by milkfish (17%), tilapia (9%), and tiger shrimp (2.4%). Aquaculture involves fish pens, \ncages, and ponds in fresh and marine waters and the mariculture of oysters, mussels, and \nseaweeds.  At  present  aquaculture  fish  production  comes  primarily  from  brackish  water \nfishponds estimated at 239,323 hectares (ha) and freshwater fishponds (14,531 ha).   \n    \n5.  The aquaculture subsector has been identified in the Government\u2019s current MTPDP \n(2004\u20132010) as a sector whose increased growth will create jobs and ensure food security in \nsupport of the country\u2019s drive toward economic development. Such growth may be attained by \nincreasing  production  intensity,  diversifying  existing  commodities  and  fishery  farms,  or \nexpanding fisheries production in inland waters. With the current focus on conservation and \nsustainable  management  of  marine  resources,  it  is  possible  that  the  contribution  of  the \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 24 October 2005. \n2  Aquaculture is the culture of various species of fish, shrimps, mollusks, oysters, mussels, and seaweeds in both \nfresh and marine waters. \n ", "2   \nmunicipal and commercial sectors to total fish production will decline in the coming years, \nleaving aquaculture as the subsector to absorb the country\u2019s ever growing demand for fish and \nmaking it potentially a significant contributor to the country\u2019s food security and poverty reduction \nagenda. \n \n6.  In recent years, small-scale aquaculture has been introduced in many parts of the \ncountry and has made important contributions to income generation and employment of the \nrural poor. The family income and expenditure survey of the National Statistics Office in 2000 \nfound  the  highest  incidence  of  poverty  (62%)  among  the  agriculture,  fishing,  and  forestry \nsectors.  The  income-generating  potential  created  by  the  growing  domestic  demand  and \nexpanding international market for fish promises opportunities for reducing rural poverty. Since \naquaculture requires only modest investments in physical and human capital, it has greater \npotential to raise the income of the poor compared with other agricultural activities. Aquaculture \nopens up new avenues for employment in the rural areas by increasing the opportunity for self-\nemployment  or  working  as  hired  labor  in  aquaculture  farms.  In  line  with  the  present \ndevelopment  strategy  of  the  Government,  which  focuses  on  the  country\u2019s  rural  poor, \naquaculture can be seen as a potential engine for rural economic growth and poverty reduction. \n \n7.  Small-scale aquaculture is already enhancing incomes and generating livelihood for \ncoastal and inland fisherfolk communities. However, the full development of aquaculture has \nbeen  constrained  by  a  variety  of  technical,  institutional,  and  financial  problems.  More \nspecifically, aquaculture is faced with the following key constraints: (i) limited access of fish \nfarmers to high-yielding environment-friendly aquaculture technologies; (ii) inadequate research \nand protocol development for breeding high value species; (iii) inadequate processing facilities \nfor producing value-added products for the export market; (iv) lack of private sector participation \nin various stages of aquaculture production, trade, and marketing; (v) inadequate regulatory \nframework including land and water use; (vi) slow market development including infrastructure \nand market information support, trade and commercialization; and (vii) non-implementation of \ninternational accreditation systems (e.g., European Union and Hazard Analysis Critical Control \nPoint). \n \n8.  ADB has been a major provider of technical and financial assistance to the Philippines \nfisheries sector. Other important sources of external assistance are the World Bank and the \nJapan Bank for International Cooperation. ADB has provided nine loans for $169.5 million for six \nprojects. ADB has also provided 10 project preparatory and advisory technical assistance for \n$3.8 million to the sector. Out of the four projects approved and implemented during 1971\u2013\n1989, two were for capture fisheries and fisheries infrastructure development, and two were for \naquaculture development. The first aquaculture project3 was rated as unsuccessful and the \nsecond4 was rated as generally successful. Since 1989, ADB support to the sector, through the \nFisheries  Sector  Program5  and  Fisheries  Resource  Management  Project6,  emphasized  on \nrationalization of sector policies and sustainable management and conservation of fisheries and \nmarine resources. The Fisheries Sector Program was assessed as partly successful and the \nnearly completed Fisheries Resource Management Project is expected to be successful in \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1978.

The lessons learned from the past program and projects highlight the \nimportance  of  private  sector  participation  in  aquaculture,  access  to  credit  facilities,  and \nconsideration of natural disasters and environmental concerns in aquaculture system design. \n \n9.  The current Government policy on fisheries resource management and conservation has \nnecessitated generation of alternative livelihoods for fisherfolk who are being withdrawn from \ncapture  fisheries.  Aquaculture  has  been  identified  as  an  alternative  livelihood  with  vast \npotentials  for  improving  the  welfare  of  fisherfolk.  However,  a  coherent,  integrated  national \nstrategic framework for the subsector is needed to address the sectoral constraints. The TA will \ndevelop  an  integrated,  strategic  road  map  for  the  aquaculture  subsector,  within  which  the \nGovernment, ADB, and the other stakeholders will be able to consider future support. The TA \nwill prepare a subsector strategy study, taking a holistic view of opportunities and constraints, \nlessons learned from past programs, and balancing the need for increased production with \nenvironmental protection over the long term. The TA is in line with the general Government and \nADB goals of poverty reduction and sustainable development while protecting the environment.  \n \n10.  The TA will contribute results and recommendations to ADB\u2019s marine and fisheries \nresources management strategy and future project interventions in the Philippines. The TA will \nalso help achieve Millennium Development Goal 1 (eradication of extreme poverty and hunger) \nand Millennium Development Goal 7 (ensure environmental sustainability). \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The  TA  will  help  formulate  and  disseminate  a  medium-  to  long-term  aquaculture \nsubsector strategy and integrated action plan with a forward investment program that will reduce \npoverty  and  enhance  the  sustainability  of  the  subsector.  The  outcomes  will  include \nrationalization of subsector policies, institutional arrangements, and planned interventions for \nexpansion of aquaculture production and productivity that will particularly benefit the poor.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The range of subsector opportunities to be tapped and constraints to be overcome \nrequire both sectorwide and subsector-specific approaches, coupled with subsector- and area-\nspecific strategies and interventions to be implemented over the medium to long term. Policies \nand strategies will be based on an in-depth study and evaluation of present conditions and \nprojected changes in the regional, national, and international settings. TA will involve surveys to \ngather pertinent information in support of strategy formulation, and workshops for consultation \nwith stakeholders. The TA will cover these main areas: (i) a subsector overview; (ii) subsector \npolicies and institutions; (iii) aquaculture subsector production, utilization, and management; (iv) \naquaculture  support  infrastructure  facilities  and  services,  including  research,  training  and \nextension, credit, trade and marketing; (v) environment, workers and consumers health and \nsafety, and fish health management; and (vi) social development and economics. For key \nactivities, the TA will (i) analyze existing policies and institutional arrangements and identify \nrequired changes for subsector development; (ii) review technical issues relevant to aquaculture \ndevelopment and management, and formulate a strategy and innovative measures to effectively \naddress the issues; (iii) review existing and potential environmental problems in the subsector \nand recommend technical, legal, and institutional measures to mitigate such problems; (iv) \nassess the adequacy and effectiveness of the aquaculture support services and credit facilities \n ", "4   \nand recommend improvement of those services and facilities with private sector participation \nand investments; and (v) formulate a medium- to long-term aquaculture development strategy \nand integrated action plan with a forward investment program that would foster private sector \nparticipation and benefit the poor and the environment. In formulating the strategy, the TA will \ntake into account the findings of relevant government and ADB studies including ADB\u2019s special \nevaluation  study  of  rural  aquaculture  development  for  poverty  reduction,7  and  project \ncompletion reports and project performance audit reports on fisheries and aquaculture sector \nprojects in the Philippines and other countries in the region.      \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $860,000 equivalent comprising $335,000 in \nforeign exchange and $525,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has requested \nADB to finance $600,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and $265,000 \nequivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the balance of the local currency cost equivalent \nof $260,000, by providing local travel expense, and office accommodation and counterpart staff. \nDetails are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Department of Agriculture (DA) will be the Executive Agency and will be responsible \nfor overall TA administration and implementation. DA will implement the TA through its Bureau \nof Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR).  BFAR will form a project management unit (PMU) \nheaded by the BFAR director as overall project manager. The manager will be assisted by two \nassistant  project  managers  for  administrative  and  technical  areas  and  will  have  adequate \ncounterpart staff that will include the Technical Management Group, for day-to-day coordination \nand implementation of the TA. The PMU responsibilities will include providing feedback to the \nconsultants and reporting to ADB. Interagency coordination will be ensured by an interagency \nsteering committee, which will be chaired by the BFAR director and will meet regularly to review \nTA progress, identify issues, take remedial actions, and provide appropriate feedback to both \nthe  consultants  and  ADB.  The  representation  of  the  committee  may  comprise  of  national \nGovernment  agencies  (National  Economic  and  Development  Authority,  DA,  Department  of \nFinance,  Department  of  Environment  and  Natural  Resources,  Department  of  Budget  and \nManagement),  the  private  sector,  academic  and  research  institutions,  non-government \norganizations (NGOs), and community-based organizations. \n \n15.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  over  approximately  8  months  from  March  2006  to \nNovember  2006.  A  participatory  process  approach  will  be  followed,  involving  extensive \nconsultation  with  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  at  the  national,  regional,  and  local  levels, \nparticularly  the  local  governments,  private  sector,  NGOs,  and  members  of  the  fishing \ncommunity, and other official development partners, to ensure that their views and inputs are \nconsidered in formulating the aquaculture subsector strategy. Consultation will be achieved \nthrough a series of national and regional workshops at inception, midterm, and final stage of the \nTA. International institutions and official development partners active in the sector will be invited \nto participate in formulating the strategy. \n \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004.

A multidisciplinary team of international (approximately 13 person-months) and domestic \nconsultants (approximately 34 person-months) will be engaged by ADB to assist DA in the \naquaculture development strategy study. The international consultants will have expertise in \naquaculture and fisheries policies and institutions, aquaculture (marine, brackish water, and \nfreshwater), and environment and fish health management. The domestic consultants will have \nexpertise in fisheries policy and institution, aquaculture product processing, aquaculture trade \nand  marketing,  marine  and  brackish  water  aquaculture,  freshwater  aquaculture, \nenvironment/fish health management, community development, credit, economics and finance, \nand legal issues. The outline terms of reference are attached in Appendix 3. The team of \nconsultants will be selected and engaged by ADB through a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. Considering the nature of the technical assistance, the \nshortlisted firms will be required to submit full technical proposals incorporating approaches and \nmethodologies they consider best for conducting the TA and achieving its objectives. Quality of \nthe proposals will be of prime consideration and, as such, the quality-based selection procedure \nbe used in selecting the consulting firm. Services and equipment will be procured in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. ADB will be responsible for procurement with DA\u2019s \nassistance. DA will provide office space for the consultants.  \n \n17.  The TA milestones include (i) preparation of a detailed work program, (ii) sector review \nand field surveys, (iii) data analysis, (iv) stakeholder consultations, and (v) formulation of the \nsector strategy. The consultants will prepare the following reports: (i) inception report within 3 \nweeks of commencing services; (ii) interim report at the end of the third month, giving a detailed \nassessment of subsector needs and broad development strategies; (iii) draft final report at the \nend of the seventh month; and (iv) final report within 3 weeks from receipt of comments on the \ndraft final report.   \n \n  \nIV.
