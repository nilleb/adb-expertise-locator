The Economic Relations Division (ERD), under the Ministry of Finance, and several \nexecuting agencies have requested ADB on various occasions, including during tripartite portfolio \nreview meetings (TPRM), for a systematic capacity development program to enhance quality of \nproject implementation and management, and project readiness. Given the growing portfolio with \nhigher complexity and relatively low project readiness, ADB\u2019s hands-on support is essential for \nsuccessful project implementation. Hence, a TRTA facility is proposed to provide project specific \nimplementation support as well as the institutional capacity development in a systematic manner.  \n \n2.  The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) facility1 will provide implementation support \nto a series of ongoing and ensuing projects.2  In addition, the facility will support capacity \ndevelopment of line ministries and executing agencies, and project review and monitoring for \nimproving the portfolio performance. The TRTA facility builds on the lessons learned from the \nimplementation of ongoing TA 8426-BAN: Capacity Building for Portfolio Management approved \non 13 August 2013, which is closing on 31 December 2018.3 Scope of TA 8426 is limited to \nsupporting portfolio review and monitoring, and short-term capacity development and trainings. \nThe purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, financing arrangements, and terms of \nreferences of the TRTA were discussed with the ERD.4 Key areas of support needs are detailed \nin the following paragraphs. \n \n3.  Portfolio-wide support. ADB\u2019s ongoing portfolio in Bangladesh has grown rapidly over \nthe past few years. Current ongoing portfolio amount stands at $8.5 billion and consists of 87 \nloans and grants for 52 projects.5 The portfolio will continue to grow as ADB\u2019s annual lending to \nBangladesh is expected to grow to $2.1 billion in 2018 from $1.3 billion in 2017. However, slow \nprocurement process, project start-up delays and lengthy process for approval and revision of \ndevelopment project proforma (DPP) and technical assistance project proforma (TAPP) are often \nhampering the project implementation, resulting in time and cost overruns. Among the 52 ongoing \nADB supported projects, over 15% are aged more than seven years, 10% were extended twice, \nand 20% were extended for more than two years. The DPPs above Tk500 million (approximately \n$6 million) require approval of Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC).6 \nTAPPs above Tk100 million (approximately $1.2 million) require approval of the minister/state \nminister of planning. All procurement packages above Tk1,000 million (approximately $12 million) \nand consultancy contracts above Tk300 million (approximately $3.6 million) have to be approved \nby the Cabinet Committee on Government Purchase (CCGP). The ECNEC and CCGP approvals \nare process intensive. The weak due diligence capacity of line ministries and executing agencies \noften result in delays in preparation, revision and approval of DPPs/TAPPs. To reduce project \n                                                \n1   The proposed TRTA is not included in the ADB 2018 country operations business plan, Bangladesh, 2018 -2020. \nThe Economic Relations Division, Government of Bangladesh has been consulted with, and it has endorsed the \nprocessing of TRTA. The South Asia Regional Department confirmed that such financial assistance can be \naccommodated in 2018 resource envelope.  \n2   Ongoing projects include Greater Dhaka Sustainable Urban Transport Project (Loan 2862/63/64), Skills for \nEmployment Investment Program \u2013Tranche 1 and 2 (Loan 3131/3468/Grant 0391/0517), and projects from \nagriculture and natural resources and transport sectors. The TRTA will also support ensuing projects on need basis.  \n3   TA 8426-BAN: Capacity Building for Portfolio Management, August 2013. \n4   ERD confirmation was received on 16 April 2018. \n5   As of 20 June 2018. \n6   The minister/state minister of planning has the authority to approve DPPs up to Tk500 million (approx. $6 million). \nThe authority for project revision by the relevant minister/state minister is limited to first revision with some \nconditions. In case of approval of TAPPs, the ministerial ceiling is up to Tk100 million (approx. $1.2 million). \n ", "2   \nlead  time,  capacity  of  executing  agencies  needs  to  be  strengthened  and  expedite  the \nDPPs/TAPPs and CCGP process.  \n \n4.  Procurement capacity support. ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Bangladesh \n(CPS 2016-2020)7 prioritizes investment in infrastructure such as energy, transport and urban \ndevelopment, and help the country\u2019s rapid economic growth. Accordingly, ADB\u2019s assistance in \nrecent years has focused on large and complex projects. The contract sizes have grown, and \nthere are several ongoing contracts valued more than $100 million. However, weak capacity of \nexecuting and implementing agencies to handle complex and diverse projects has been a \nconcern. While concerted efforts supported by the government and development partners to \ndevelop institutional capacity are ongoing, progress is incremental. Hence, the CPS (2016-2020) \nenvisages  more  project-based  assistance  on  procurement  and  project  implementation  by \nproviding on-the-job training with direct oversight of result and outcome. In addition, stronger \nsupport is needed in application of ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy 2017 and Procurement Regulations \nfor ADB Borrowers 2017 (as amended from time to time). \n \n5.  Institutional capacity and governance. Institutional capacity and governance are also \nthe priority cross-cutting areas identified by CPS (2016-2020) for enhancing the effectiveness of \nADB-assisted projects and programs. The CPS (2016-2020) recommends providing systematic \ninstitutional capacity support over a longer period and more targeted than general.  \n \n6.  Financial management. Timely preparation and submission of year-end audited project \nfinancial statements (APFS) following international accounting standards are essential for sound \npublic financial management and good governance. Support to strengthen country systems, \nimplementation and monitoring mechanism of financial management action plan, and fiduciary \nreviews in weaker and decentralized sectors are critical. ADB is supporting the executing and \nimplementing agencies for improving the financial management and resolution of audit issues. \nHowever, the audit exit meeting for FY2017 shows that out of 1,034 audit observations for ADB \nsupported projects, only 415 or 45% were resolved, 11% more than the previous year (34% in \nFY2016). ADB\u2019s oversight and technical support on resolution of audit issues needs to be \nstrengthened. More collaboration with Foreign Aided Project Audit Directorate (FAPAD) is needed \nto improve the quality of audit as per international standard of auditing (ISA) and international \nstandard of supreme audit institutions (ISSAI). Current accounting systems in most of the ADB \nfunded projects are standalone, and government\u2019s ongoing roll-out plan of unified accounting \nsoftware needs support at project level. \n \n7.  Project implementation support. On the project specific case, Loan-2862/63/64/Grant-\n0287(BAN): Greater Dhaka Sustainable Urban Transport Project,8 a complex project, has several \nimplementation challenges, such as delays in review of engineering designs, land acquisition and \ninter-agency coordination. Project completion date has been revised to December 2020, but this \nremains a challenge. Moreover, project start-up has been delayed by more than three years. \nAmong the four consultancy packages under the project, contract of operational design and \nbusiness model (ODBM) was closed in December 2017 without completing the envisaged outputs. \nThe consultant completed only two of the three outputs. It delivered (i) bus rapid transit (BRT) \n                                                \n7   ADB. 2016. Country Partnership Strategy: Bangladesh, 2016\u20132020. Manila. \n8  Project is approved in April 2012 with planned completion by 2015. However, project has been delayed by 3 years. \nProcurement of major civil works is completed only in 2017 as opposed to the planned 2014. The major component \n\u2014construction of bus rapid transit corridor which was planned to start in Q1-2013 could start only in Q2-2017, \ncausing a delay of more than three years. The loans have been extended by three years up to December 2020. \nProject  is  categorized  A  for  Involuntary  Resettlement,  B  for  Environment  and  C  for  Indigenous  Peoples. \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/42169-013/main#project-pds \n ", "3 \noperational plan and (ii) BRT business model. But, approval of the two reports has been delayed \ndue to capacity and resource limitation of implementing agency. A third component under the \nODBM for \u2018negotiation with the existing bus operators to embark into the company model\u2019 has not \nbeen accomplished. On the other hand, consulting contracts of project management, coordination \nand  capacity  building  (PMCCB);  engineering,  procurement  and  construction  management \n(EPCM); and resettlement plan implementation (RPI) are closing in December 2018. Hence, there \nwill be a gap in consultants\u2019 input. Project needs support to (i) review the operational plan and \nbusiness model, (ii) study on integration of BRT with mass rapid transit (MRT) system, (iii) \nnegotiation with the existing bus operators to embark into company model, and (iv) project and \ncontract management of civil works. The allocated budget for consultancy under the project has \nbeen exhausted.9  The TRTA will partially fill in the resource gap beyond December 2018. \n \n8.  Similarly, Loan 3131/Grant 0391-BAN - Skills for Employment Investment Program10 \nneeds improved management of fiduciary risk. Office of Anticorruption and Integrity (OAI) has \nconducted a project procurement related review (PPRR) in 2017.11 The following three issues are \nnoted in OAI\u2019s PPRR interim report (i) documents for milestone and stipends payments are \ninadequate, (ii) monitoring of training centers is inadequate and (iii) financial management of \nindustry associations is weak. OAI has suggested for improvement in (i) document keeping, (ii) \nreview of milestone-based payments for job placements, and (iii) transparency in stipend payment. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Capacity of executing agencies and line ministries improved. The TRTA \nwill enhance the project implementation capacity of executing and implementing agencies by \nproviding  structured  trainings  and  capacity  building  support  on  procurement;  financial \nmanagement and audit; project management; and cross-cutting issues such as environmental \nand social safeguards, and gender empowerment and social inclusion. The TRTA will also \nsupport in successful roll out of ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy 2017.  \n \n10.  The TRTA will develop a systematic capacity development plan that cuts across the entire \nproject cycle. Learning from the experience of capacity development resource center (CDRC) \nestablished in ADB\u2019s India and Nepal Resident Missions, the TRTA facility will set up a CDRC in \nADB\u2019s Bangladesh Resident Mission. As part of CDRC activity, survey and capacity assessment \nof executing and implementing agencies will be conducted for training needs assessment. Annual \ntraining calendar will be developed, and trainings delivered on the areas highlighted in para 9. \nAdditional thematic capacity development activities will cover trainings on high level technologies, \ninnovation, new business opportunities, project evaluation, climate change and disaster risk \nmanagement, and good governance and anticorruption measures. Training materials prepared \nby ADB\u2019s India and Nepal Resident Missions may be referred as appropriate. E-learning modules \nof the trainings will be developed. A CDRC website12 will be maintained to share the training \nmaterials and e-learning activities. The website will also maintain trainees database and facilitate \ncommunication with the trainees. A mobile based application of the website will also be developed. \n                                                \n9   Four consultant contracts include (i) PMCCB -$1.274 million, (ii) EPCM -$4.112 million, (iii) ODBM - $0.872 million, \nand (iv) RPI - $0.135 million. \n10  Approved on 3 Jun 2014 for $100 million, co-financed by World Bank ($79 million); revised closing date 30 Jun \n2019. Project is categorized C for Involuntary Resettlement, C for Environment and B for Indigenous Peoples. \nhttps://www.adb.org/projects/42466-015/main \n11  OAI\u2019s PPRR missions were fielded on 20 August - 7 September 2017 and 13 November - 6 December 2017, and \nexit meeting was held on 12 December 2017. \n12  Website developed by TRTA will follow the Guidelines on Social Media at ADB and the Branding Tool Kit. \n ", "4   \n11.  The TRTA facility will engage a CDRC Team Leader / Training Coordinator. In addition to \nsector and thematic staff from ADB, a roster of external (international and national) resource \npersons will be maintained to deliver the trainings.13 The external resource persons will be \nengaged on need basis. The CDRC will train approximately 500 officials from various executing \nand implementing agencies. Overseas trainings for up to 50 government officials will be organized \nbased on the demand and needs assessment. The CDRC may support the executing and \nimplementing agencies for certified or accredited short-term trainings, as appropriate. \n \n12.  Output 2. Projects successfully implemented. Implementation of series of ongoing and \nensuing projects on procurement, safeguards, financial management, project implementation and \ncontract management will be supported. The TRTA will recruit international consultants to support \nimplementation of Greater Dhaka Sustainable Urban Transport Project (Loan 2862/63/64/Grant \n0287-BAN). The consultants will support to (i) review the operational plan and business model, \n(ii) study integration of BRT with MRT subprojects, (iii) negotiate with existing bus operators to \nembark into company model, and (iii) ensure engineering due diligence of civil works.14  Loan \n3131/Grant 0391-BAN: Skills for Employment Investment Program will be supported for improving \nthe financial management and mitigating the fiduciary risk. In addition, TRTA will support at least \nfive ongoing or ensuing projects in different sectors on project implementation on need basis. \n \n13.  Output 3: Portfolio performance effectively reviewed and monitored. To enhance the \noperational effectiveness of ADB\u2019s portfolio, the TRTA will help strengthen portfolio review and \nmonitoring. The TRTA will support at least five TPRMs and three business opportunities seminars. \nIt will support implementation of various actions agreed in the TPRMs. Trainings and IT support \nto  roll-out  procurement  activity  monitoring  tool  (PAMT)  developed  in  Bangladesh  Resident \nMission in 2018 will be provided to all projects for improved monitoring of procurement activities.15  \nThe TRTA will develop a quality management system as per International Organization for \nStandardization (ISO: 9001-2015).16 Annual portfolio performance of Bangladesh for 2018 will be \nprepared to assess the portfolio performance and make recommendation for improvement. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $1.6 million, of which $1.5 million equivalent will be financed \non a grant basis from ADB\u2019s technical assistance fund (TASF - 6) while the government will \nprovide the rest as counterpart support in kind, such as data, staff time, venues for meetings and \nevents, review of the reports submitted by consultants, and participation in trainings, workshops \nand knowledge sessions. The cost estimate and financing plan is in Appendix 1 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TRTA. In consultation with ERD, and executing and implementing \nagencies, the overall framework program structure and outputs will be finalized. Bangladesh \nResident Mission will recruit, supervise and evaluate the consultants, and procure the goods.  \n \n \n \n                                                \n13   Travel cost of ADB staff acting as a resource person will be supported by TRTA, as appropriate. \n14  The DMFs of the projects are updated to reflect the outputs and activities of the TRTA. The updated versions will \nbe incorporated in the project administration manuals of the respective projects. \n15   PAMT is a web-based database (www.bdpamt.org) that records, monitors the time taken at each step of \nprocurement process, and tracks and alerts the delays. \n16   ISO 9001:2015 - quality management system certification will help ADB achieving the high standard operation. \n ", "5 \n16.
