INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support Mongolia\u2019s energy \npolicy to (i) mitigate air pollution; and (ii) ensure a reliable, clean, and secure primary energy \nsupply in Mongolia by preparing a methane gas supply infrastructure development strategy. The \nstrategy will provide a road map to replace coal with cleaner methane gas in selected and \nprioritized uses. \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the country's Implementation Plan for the Government Action Plan, \n2016\u20132020 (Government Resolution No. 121)1 and is included in the country operations business \nplan, 2020\u20132021 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for Mongolia.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Air pollution. The Government of Mongolia approved the National Program on Reduction \nof Air and Environmental Pollution in March 2017,  which set the target to reduce air and \nenvironmental pollution by at least 50% by 2025.3 The program aims to impose a total ban on the \nuse of unprocessed coal with few exceptions, such as thermal power plants in Ulaanbaatar. Upon \nthe government\u2019s request, ADB is assisting the government to meet the policy target.4 \n \n4.  Air pollution\u2014one of the most serious issues in Mongolia\u2014poses serious public health \nrisks. According to the World Health Organization, annual mean particulate matter of less than \n2.5 micrometers in diameter (an indicator of air pollution) in Ulaanbaatar, where about half of the \nnation\u2019s population lives, is 6\u201310 times higher than the recommended safe levels in the World \nHealth Organization air quality guidelines. Pollution levels are worse during winter months (from \nDecember to March). Burning solid fuel, mainly raw coal and waste, in ger (traditional tent) areas \n(about 220,000 households) for heat and cooking contribute 80% of pollution. Vehicle emissions \nand coal-fired combined heat and power plants are also major contributors.5 Ger areas lack \nadequate public services, such as district heating supply, which have not kept up with increasing \ndemand from nomadic herders migrating to the capital city. \n \n5.  Cleaner  domestic  primary  energy  resource.  The  Implementation  Plan  for  the \nGovernment Action Plan, 2016\u20132020 aims to develop a master plan for the country\u2019s first \nnationwide gas supply system using unconventional primary energy resources, such as domestic \nmethane gas from coal reserves, as well as imported gas. To assist such activities, the Midterm \nNational Program, 2019\u20132023 for the Implementation of the State Policy on Energy has set a goal \nof ensuring reliable energy supply and security.6 The government has conducted similar activities \n \n1  Government of Mongolia. 2016.

LPG use for transport is now nearly 10 times higher than the usage rate before \nthe program, improving the air quality. Although having made success in the transport sector, the \nprogram has not met the residential heat demand because its supply cost is higher than those of \nincumbent fuels. The government has also studied exploring and/or producing methane gas from \ndomestic coal reserves with support from the United States Environmental Protection Agency, but \nthe scope did not cover gas transmission and distribution.7 \n \n6.  To address these issues, the government requested ADB to support the study to prepare \nthe country\u2019s first nationwide methane gas supply infrastructure development strategy. This will \ncontribute toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions and improving air quality by switching fuel \nfrom coal to methane gas. This is in line with ADB's Strategy 2030 operational priorities on (i) \ntackling climate change, building climate and disaster resilience, and enhancing environmental \nsustainability; and (ii) making cities more livable. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: (i) air quality improved and (ii) reliable and \ncleaner energy supply secured (footnotes 1 and 3). The TA will have the following outcome: \nreadiness for investments in methane gas supply infrastructure increased.8 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n8.  The TA team will recruit consultants to provide solutions for the identified problems and \nfor the strategy to develop a methane gas supply chain for Mongolia\u2019s heating and power demand. \nThe study will cover the gas supply chain as detailed in paras. 9\u201312. \n \n9.  Output 1: Methane gas supply chain development strategy paper prepared. The \nstrategy will cover the entire country and focus on demand mainly from households for heating \nand cooking and partly from small heat-only boilers and selected combined heat and power plants. \nUnder this output, the TA team will \n(i)  conduct gas demand and supply forecasting; \n(ii)  assess domestic coal mine methane and coal bed methane resources; \n(iii)  develop basic technical design, such as gas transportation technology; \n(iv)  conduct market assessments, including tariff and institutional design; \n(v)  assess  the  legal  and  regulatory  framework,  specifically  the  responsibility  of \nrelevant ministries; \n(vi)  evaluate the methane gas supply business scheme; \n(vii)  prepare  a  roadmap,  including  a  10-year  infrastructure  development  plan,  a \npreliminary safeguard impact assessment, and an investment plan; and \n(viii)  summarize the above findings into a development strategy. \n \n \n7  B.

Under this output the TA team will (i) identify future investment projects on \ngas supply infrastructure and (ii) prepare a prefeasibility study report on the identified projects. \n \n11.  Output 3: Capacity in methane gas supply infrastructure enhanced. Under this output \nthe TA team will \n(i)  enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Energy on the methane gas supply system, \nand organize an international study tour to build the capacity of executing agency \nstaff; \n(ii)  organize domestic workshops to disseminate findings, inviting resource persons \nfor knowledge transfer of international best practice; and \n(iii)  prepare  a  capacity  building  program  for  the  executing  agency  and  relevant \nstakeholders on methane gas infrastructure and business practice, which will (a) \ndeliver a report that summarizes international best practice on methane gas \ninfrastructure development and business operation practice and (ii) prepare a \npublic awareness program on the use of methane gas. \n \n12.  Knowledge dissemination. Publications will primarily be digital but will also be printed to \nmaximize readership. The number of hard copies will be agreed with the executing agency during \nTA implementation. The major target audience will include relevant government entities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.2 million equivalent, of which (i) $0.5 million will be financed \non a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund (EAKPF), and \n(ii) $0.5 million will be financed on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty \nReduction and Regional Cooperation Fund (PRC Fund),9 both to be administered by ADB; and \n(iii) $0.2 million will be the estimated monetary value of the counterpart contribution from the \ngovernment. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n14.  The EAKPF will finance operational expenses related to eligible activities indicated in the \nfund\u2019s implementation guidelines.10 The fund will not be used for civil works, procurement of large-\nscale equipment, permanent staffing costs, or recruitment of staff consultants, unless otherwise \nagreed between the Government of the Republic of Korea and ADB. \n \n15.  The PRC Fund will finance operational expenses related to TA, grant, and other eligible \ninitiatives agreed by the Ministry of Finance of the People\u2019s Republic of China and ADB, including \nconsulting  services,  training,  conferences,  workshops,  small-scale  civil  works  and/or  other \nassociated demonstration-level equipment and materials.11 \n \n16.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of staff, office accommodation, \noffice  supplies,  secretarial  assistance,  domestic  transportation,  information  and  documents \nrelevant for the preparation of the TA, and other in-kind contributions. \n \n \n9 The fund was originally named the \u201cPeople\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund\u201d \nin the 2005 Board paper. \n10 ADB. 2018.
