INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program (GMS program), a \nflagship regional cooperation initiative supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), is \nentering its third decade in 2012.1 Since 2002, the program has been implemented under a \nstrategic framework adopted by the first GMS Summit, ending in 2012. To guide the program in \nits next decade, a new GMS Strategic Framework, 2012\u20132022 has been developed by member \ncountries with ADB assistance and will be considered for adoption by the 4th GMS Summit \nmeeting in December 2011. The new strategic framework marks a major shift in the GMS \nprogram,  reflecting  changes  in  the  regional  environment  as  well  as  achievements  of  the \nprogram to date. Under the new framework, the program will need to increasingly shift focus \nfrom conventional infrastructure to multisector investment projects, along with greater emphasis \non infrastructure \u2015software\u2016 or policy and institutional reforms to build on physical connectivity, \nand increased coordination across sectors. A substantial regional investment program aligned \nwith the priorities of the new strategic framework, which will comprise the next generation \npipeline for the GMS program, needs to be developed. Continued country ownership in the \nGMS  program,  anchored  on  the  new  investment  program,  will  facilitate  further  regional \ncooperation in policy and institutional reforms that complement physical infrastructure as well in \nthe provision of regional public goods. At the Third GMS Economic Corridors Forum (ECF-3), a \nminister-level forum held in Vientiane on 30 June 2011, the GMS countries requested ADB to \ninitiate preparation of a regional multisector investment framework to foster the development of \nGMS corridors and to develop a program of investments aligned to the implementation of the \nnew GMS strategic framework. The ECF-3 recommendations were endorsed by the 17th GMS \nMinisterial  Conference  in  Phnom  Penh  in  August  2011,  which  requested  ADB  to  present \nsubstantive  outcomes  of  the  regional  investment  planning  exercise  at  the  2012  Ministerial \nConference.  The  design  and  monitoring  framework  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  in \nAppendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Initial  phase  of  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion.  For  much  of  its  first  phase, \ncomprising the two decades since its inception, the GMS program has successfully focused on \nincreased connectivity through the development of transport corridors, manifest in three major \nGMS corridors\u2014the East\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC), North\u2013South Economic Corridor \n(NSEC), and Southern Economic Corridor (SEC).3 Except for a few segments, the achievement \nof the GMS corridors as transport arteries is in an advanced stage of completion.   \n \n3.  Policy and institutional development. With the help of ADB, the GMS countries have \nsubsequently moved toward improving the software for utilizing the developed transport arteries. \nStarting with the 13th GMS Ministerial Conference in December 2004, subsequent high-level \nGMS forums have emphasized transport and trade facilitation, and the 16th GMS Ministerial \nConference in 2010 in Ha Noi approved an Action Plan for Transport and Trade Facilitation in \n                                                \n1  The GMS program started in 1992 and includes Cambodia, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, \nThailand, Viet Nam, and the People\u2019s Republic of China, focusing on Yunnan Province and Guangxi Autonomous \nRegion. Details about the GMS program are available at http://www.adb.org/gms.  \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 9 November 2011. The concept \npaper was approved by the Vice-President, Operations 2, on 20 September 2011. \n3  The East\u2013West Economic Corridor (EWEC) is the only direct and continuous land route between the Andaman Sea \nand the South China Sea. The North\u2013South Economic Corridor (NSEC) has three subcorridors\u2014Kunming to \nBangkok via the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic or Myanmar, Kunming to Ha Noi and on to Hai Phong; and \nNanning to Ha Noi. The Southern Economic Corridor (SEC) comprises three subcorridors, including the central \nsubcorridor linking Bangkok to Phnom Penh to Ho Chi Minh City. \n ", "2     \nthe GMS. Transport and trade facilitation will remain a focus area under the new strategic \nframework, along with development of logistics and freight forwarding services. \n \n4.  Corridor  development  and  the  new  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  strategic \nframework. The new strategic framework is anchored on the corridor-development approach, \nand recognizes that further development of the GMS transport corridors into economic corridors \ncannot be accomplished without adequately focusing on widening and deepening of these \ncorridors through the development of areas along and contiguous to the corridors.4 This will \ncontribute to increased demand for trade and trade facilitation services while improved transport \nand trade facilitation can enhance the supply of these facilitating services. Strengthening both \ndemand and supply for trade facilitation in a balanced way is the key to boost the volume and \nbenefits of trade for less developed areas of member countries, with a beneficial impact on \npoverty  reduction.  Corridor  development  will  entail  substantial  and  multisector  investments \naimed at urban development, logistics, network of feeder and rural roads, multimodal transport, \ncatalyzing private sector investment through supply chains, and easier movement of goods and \npeople.  Development  of  such  projects  will  require  careful  analysis  of  regional  investment \npriorities, costs, and benefits, including environment and social impacts; and complementary \ninstitutional and policy reforms. Increased competitiveness at subregional and sector levels, and \nan enhanced role of private sector investments in the program pipeline, need to be further \nintegrated  into  implementation  of  the  new  strategic framework. The multisector  investment \napproach needs to be based on sound analytical work that is empirically informed and regional \nin approach.  \n \n5.  Regional context. The GMS countries straddle a dynamic region between large and \nfast-growing economies in East Asia and South Asia, and it is easy to project economic activity \nof several trillion US dollars in the expanded region within the next decade, as indicated by the \nAsia 2050 study.5 Growth nodes of today may be complemented or surpassed by new centers \ncatering to the increasing trade flows accompanying the high levels of economic activity. Both \nconceptually and operationally, now is a good time to do a regional investment framework, \nbuilding on existing knowledge, current trends, and medium-term forecasts in regional economic \nactivity, including trade and urban development. The regional investment framework can ensure \nthat increased channeling of resources in GMS corridor development, through their widening \nand deepening, is based on sound economic and technical analysis from the start, including a \ngood cost\u2013benefit assessment. Given the scale and scope of investments necessary, it is also \nimportant to  incorporate  environmental  dimensions  of the  investments\u2014consistent  with  the \nincreasing and repeated emphasis of member countries on the need to address environment \nand climate change as part of the new GMS strategic framework, and to emphasize sustainable \ndevelopment  approaches,  including  for  growth  of  cities  in  the  subregion.  The  regional \ninvestment framework can also serve as the launch pad for discussing higher-level cooperation \nin the GMS program in its third decade, including increased regional cross-border investments.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome   \n6.  The impact will be the enhanced development of GMS corridors. The impact will be \nassessed quantitatively by the increase in intra-GMS trade along these corridors, and through \nincreased  adoption  of  a  multisector  approach  to  investments  linked  to  the  corridors.  The  \n                                                \n4 These arguments are further developed in P. Srivastava. 2011. Regional Corridors Development in Regional \nCooperation. ADB Economics Working Paper Series. No. 258 (May). Manila: ADB. \n5   ADB. 2011. Asia 2050: Realizing the Asian Century. Singapore. \n ", "        3 \noutcome will be a strengthened GMS regional cooperation program encompassing multisector \ninvestment  approaches  and  coordination.  Performance  with  respect  to  outcome  will  be \nassessed by identification of sectoral and multisector regional priorities for investments and \npolicy cooperation, and the adoption by working groups of multisector indicators for corridor \ndevelopment, mainstreaming a multisector investment approach and coordination in the GMS \nprogram. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities    \n7.  A comprehensive regional investment planning approach would require several steps: \n(i) diagnosis, (ii) macro-framework building, (iii) sectoral planning, (iv) intersectoral coordination, \n(v) plan finalization, (vi) action program formulation, and (vii) planning for implementation. To \nenhance its manageability while promoting flexibility, it is proposed to undertake this task in two \nphases,  with  the  first  phase  focusing  on  thorough  diagnostics,  analytical  studies,  and \nformulation of a macro framework along with initial elements of sectoral planning, including \nneeded institutional elements.6 Continued commitment of the GMS countries to pursue a more \nextensive and intensive corridor development is assumed for this project, while a potential risk is \ndisruption or delays arising from global or regional economic volatility and downturn. \n \n8.  The TA will include four outputs: (i) a series of diagnostic and analytical reports; (ii) a \nregional multisector investment framework (first phase) to maximize the potential of regional \ninvestments for inclusive growth; (iii) a sector and program-level results framework for sector \nplanning; and (iv) a GMS knowledge platform pilot-tested for enhanced country ownership of the \nsecond generation of GMS investments. Each output will be oriented toward the development of \nan  investment  program  that  is  practical,  implementable,  and  results-focused  and  that  will \ngenerate strong ownership and commitment on the part of GMS countries.  \n \n9.  Diagnostics. The TA will build and pull together primary and secondary diagnostics for \nthe GMS that will facilitate development of sector results-monitoring frameworks and provide \nuseful  inputs  into  the  analytical  assessments.  The  diagnostics  will  include  empirical \nassessments of economic (e.g., the total product at province level, sectors of activity, trade links, \nmarket access, labor force quantity and quality, poverty incidence, and distribution), social \n(e.g., population  profile,  ethnic  classification,  literacy,  and  education  achievement),  and \nenvironmental (e.g., stock and usage of resources, past and present trends in degradation, \nlandscape and ecosystem boundaries, land use planning) data and indicators for the GMS. \n \n10.  Analytical  assessments.  The  analytical  assessments  will  shape  and  interpret  the \ndiagnostic outputs, along with analyzing policies, constraints, and opportunities at sector and \nsubnational levels. Special topics may also be covered, such as modeling subregional tradeoffs \nin  resources  utilization  across  energy  sufficiency  and  food  security;  assessing  trends  and \ndeveloping  projections  for  key  economic,  social,  and  environmental  variables  as  well  as \ndeveloping analytical links between them at a macroeconomic level. The starting point for these \nassessments will be existing plans and strategies such as the strategy and action plans for \ncorridors and GMS sectoral strategies or papers (e.g., transport,7 railways,8 agriculture,9 the \n                                                \n6  The second phase will be undertaken as a separate project whose design and scope will be determined by the \noutputs of the proposed TA. Similar comprehensive planning was undertaken near the start of the GMS almost \n15 years ago. Both the GMS program and the GMS have evolved considerably since then.   \n7   ADB. 2007.

An important part of the analytical assessments would involve \nmapping existing national and subnational plans to identify potential regional synergies for \ncorridor development. Related analytical work by development partners will be incorporated. \n \n11.  Crosscutting  themes.  Three  crosscutting  themes  will  be  central  to  the  analytical \nassessments\u2014competitiveness,  private  sector  investment  and  involvement,  and  green \ndevelopment. These are important to the effective implementation of the new GMS strategic \nframework and to the program as a whole, which has been described in terms of connectivity, \ncompetitiveness, and community building. With substantial progress in the past two decades in \nconnectivity, the GMS program focus has to shift toward the role of regional cooperation in \nenhancing the competitiveness of the region. Increased focus on transport and trade facilitation \nis a key component of seeking competitiveness promotion. Enhancing competitiveness will be \nboosted by human resource development and a greater role of the private sector in the program. \nPolicy and other constraints to private sector development and investment for the GMS will be \nconsidered along with analysis of possible regional approaches to addressing these. Finally, the \nemphasis  by  member  countries  on  exploring  green  development  approaches  has  been \nrecognized  by  the  new  strategic  framework  and  will  be  incorporated  in  the  analytical \nassessments. \n \n12.  Macro framework. The diagnostics and analytical assessments will be used to help \nassess and prioritize growth opportunities in relation to impediments and constraints at sector \nlevel as well as in terms of multisector approaches. The regional macro framework formulation \nwill  include  identifying  high  level  sectoral  and  multisectoral  regional  initiatives  for  both \ninvestment and for policy and institutional reforms that could be explored in subsequent work to \nselect or propose specific projects for further development, such as in transport logistics, urban \ndevelopment, and secondary roads. The macro framework along with associated diagnostics \nand analytical assessments will comprise the first phase of the regional investment framework. \n \n13.  Institutional elements. The proposed TA will include two institutional elements. First, to \nstrengthen  ownership  and  implementation  of  projects  subsequently  developed  from  the \ninvestment framework, it will be necessary to build partnerships among diverse stakeholders, \nincluding subnational entities, the private sector, and civil society through inclusive consultation \nworkshops  and  to  a  limited  extent  building  capacity.  The  GMS  program  has  a  fairly \ncomprehensive  institutional  structure  that  can  support  such  an  approach.  The  second \ninstitutional element of the TA will implement a recommendation from the 17th GMS Ministerial \nConference to pilot test a knowledge platform for the GMS, by bringing into the proposed \nanalytical  work  regional  institutions  and  specialists  wherever  possible,  while  ensuring  the \ngeneration  of  high  quality  analytical  outputs  to  inform  GMS  policy  makers.  This  work  will \ncomplement similar work being undertaken in some of the resident missions as part of their \nnational programs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.5 million equivalent, of which $500,000 will be financed \non a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV); $500,000 from TASF-\nOthers; and $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Regional Cooperation and \nIntegration  Fund11 under  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Financing  Partnership \nFacility. Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n                                                \n10 ADB. 2011.

ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, which will be administered by the Regional \nCooperation and Operations Coordination Division of the Southeast Asia Department (SERD) \nfrom approval in December 2011 to 31 March 2013. Close coordination will be maintained with \nresident missions and sector divisions during implementation through requesting assignment of \nfocal points. In particular, sector division inputs will be sought more for outputs 1 and 2 of the TA, \nand that of resident missions for outputs 3 and 4. A steering committee, comprising the GMS \nnational coordinators among others, will be set up to oversee the overall implementation and \nmonitoring of the TA outputs. National consultants under the TA will be used to support the \nGMS national coordinators as needed, and may be based in the resident missions. The steering \ncommittee will be supported by an advisory group from the academe and other development \npartners  to  provide  technical  guidance.  Development  partners  are  expected  to  play  an \nincreasing role in the GMS program\u2019s growing investment needs, and the TA will seek to include \nthem  in the early  planning stages to  strengthen  the  resource mobilization  potential  of the \nresulting investment program. Careful attention will also need to be given to the institutional \naspects in terms of linkages between study teams on one  hand and advisory or steering \ncommittees and national or regional bodies (including GMS sectoral working groups and forums) \non the other\u2014to ensure leveraging knowledge at different levels and enhancing ownership of \nthe planning exercise. Regular tripartite meetings between governments, the project team, and \nADB  will be programmed as  well as participatory public seminars to review progress and \ndiscuss interim findings.  \n \n16.  SERD\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations  Coordination  Division  will  assign  an \ninternational staff to supervise TA implementation in coordination with sector divisions and \nresident missions, together with administrative support from relevant national and administrative \nstaff,  and  the  GMS  Secretariat  based  in  ADB.  Because  of  the  diversity  of  analytical  and \nresearch requirements and the need for countries\u2019 engagement through the steering committee \nin TA implementation, individual consultants will be engaged under the TA for 28 person-months \nof international and 54 person-months of national consulting. Areas of expertise needed include \nregional  cooperation,  environment  planning  and  risk  assessment,  social  and  gender \ndevelopment, trade and competitiveness, urban development, rural development, transport, and \ngeographic information systems (the outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3). Consultants \nwill be engaged on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). Equipment financed under the TA will be procured by ADB in accordance with \nits Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.
