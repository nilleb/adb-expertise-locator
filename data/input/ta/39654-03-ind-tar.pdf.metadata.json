Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved technical assistance cluster (TAC) 4814-IND \nfor $15 million to the Government of India (the Government) on 30 June 2006. The TAC is \nfinanced by the Government of the United Kingdom through its Department for International \nDevelopment (DFID). The TAC, provided in response to the Government\u2019s request, fast-tracks \nhigh-priority infrastructure projects and supports improvements in project preparedness, project \ndesign, and implementation capacity under ADB\u2019s India program. The Board of Directors (the \nBoard) had approved the inclusion of project preparatory technical assistance (TA) activities \nunder the TAC on an exceptional basis1. The design and monitoring framework for the TAC is \nprovided in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  The TA cluster has been completed with effect from 30 June 2008. The original TA \ncompletion period of 30 months had to be reduced to 24 months i.e., from 31 December 2008 to \n30  June  2008  to  co-terminate  with  the  closure  of  the  United  Kingdom  Cooperation  Fund \n(Poverty Focused) for Technical Assistance (DFID Trust Fund for India).  \n \n3.  This consolidated report on the implementation progress of the TAC has been prepared \nin accordance with paragraph 26 of the TAC paper, which requires periodic submission of a \nconsolidated Board Information Paper (BIP), to the Board and the Management of the ADB. \nThis is the third BIP, the previous two having been submitted in March 2007 and September \n2007. This BIP is being submitted on conclusion of the TA Cluster to enable comprehensive \nreporting of progress and impacts. \n \n \nII.  SUMMARY OF IMPLEMENTATION PROGRESS \n \nA.   Impact and Outcome  \n \n4.  Improved project implementation readiness and efficiency. Twenty four months of \nTAC  implementation  has  resulted  in  21  well  prepared  projects  for  $6  billion,  ready  for \nimplementation,  for  the  ADB  India  program  (2006-2010).  The  TAC  has  also  significantly \nimproved  the  efficiency  of  preparing,  processing,  and  approving  TAs,  aided  by  the  TAC\u2019s \nsimplified procedures. As a result, 22 CTAs were endorsed for implementation within 12 months \nof TAC effectivity.  \n \n5.  Through project preparatory activities and detailed design activities, the component TAs \n(CTAs) included under the TAC have directly contributed to enhancing project preparedness, \nimproving project design, and strengthening effective implementation capacity under ADB\u2019s \nIndia program. \n \n6.  Comprehensive  and  better  project  preparation  has  reduced  delays  in  project \ncommencement after loan approval and will reduce the accrual of commitment charges to the \nGovernment because of start-up delays. The TAC has also contributed to reduced need for \nstand-alone TA projects and increased the Government\u2019s ownership of follow-up projects. The \nTAC has also strengthened the link between the country programming exercise and project \npreparation schedule.   \n \n                                                 \n1 TACs were introduced in ADB. 1997. Review of the Bank\u2019s Technical Assistance Operations. Manila. However, \nTACs were restricted to advisory TA projects. ", "  2\n7.  Enhanced Client Ownership and Responsiveness. The TAC has been responsive to \nthe  Government\u2019s  need  for  comprehensive  project  preparation,  improved  efficiency,  and \nenhanced ownership of project preparation and implementation under ADB\u2019s India program. \nThe  TAC  modality  and  the  provisions  for  the  Joint  Task  Force  (JTF)  have  enabled  the \nGovernment  to  directly  participate  and  engage  in  the  planning  and  monitoring  of  project \npreparation activities. Many of the changes in work scope of the CTAs have been undertaken in \nresponse to the need of executing agencies (EAs) for additional TA support.  \n \nB.   Outputs  \n \n8.  The  TAC  has  supported  a  range  of  preparatory  and  feasibility  studies  to  support \ninvestments suitable for development financing. These have resulted in the following outputs: \n \nEight follow on loan projects were approved for ADB financing worth $2.7 billion. The projects \nare: \n(i)  Madhya Pradesh State Roads II Project ($320 million)  \n(ii)  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Sector  Development  Investment  Program  ($620 \nmillion),  \n(iii)  Jammu and Kashmir Urban Sector Investment Program ($300 million)  \n(iv)  North Karnataka Urban Sector Investment Program ($270 million)  \n(v)  Kolkata Environment Improvement Project (Supplementary Financing) ($80 \nmillion).  \n(vi)  India Infrastructure Project Financing Facility ($500 million) \n(vii)  Rajasthan  Urban  Sector  Development  Investment  Program  (formerly \nRajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Phase II) ($273 million) \n(viii)  Uttaranchal Urban Development Project ($350 million) \n \n9.  Thirteen loan projects are proposed for approval over 2008-2010 for $3.24 billion. The \nprojects are: \n \n(i)  Himachal Pradesh Clean Energy Development Investment Program ($800 \nmillion) \n(ii)  Bihar Power Sector Development Program ($500 million) \n(iii)  Khadi and Village Industries Development Program ($150 million) \n(iv)  North Eastern States Trade and Investment Creation Initiative ($100 million) \n(v)  Mizoram Public Resource Management Development Program ($150 million) \n(vi)  Agribusiness Infrastructure Development Project ($250 million) \n(vii)  Orissa Integrated Irrigated Agriculture and Water Management Project (MFF \nfor $188.5 million) \n(viii)  North Eastern State Integrated Flood and Riverbank Erosion Management \nProject (Arunanchal Pradesh component for $80 million) \n(ix)  State Roads Projects in Chattisgarh and Jharkhand ($200 million)  \n(x)  North Eastern State Roads Investment Program ($300 million) \n(xi)  Nagpur Water Supply Project ($40 million in 2008) and another $40 million for \nVijayawada Water Supply in 2009. (Total of $80 million)  \n(xii)  Tourism Infrastructure Development Project ($300 million) \n(xiii)  Bihar Urban Sector Development Investment Program ($150 million) \n \n10.  The TAC has greatly improved project readiness. It has helped projects to graduate \nfrom preparation of preliminary designs to meeting advanced requirements like detailed project \nreports  (DPRs)  and  its  subsidiary  documents  (bidding  documents,  terms  of  reference  for ", "3   \nsupervision  consultants,  resettlement  plans,  environment  management  plans,  etc.).  This  is \nhelping EAs in pre-construction activities on the ground. In the proposed Jharkhand State \nRoads project, for example, detailed engineering designs as well as resettlement plans based \non 100% census are already in place, much ahead of the programmed approval of the project \nearly next year. Such high levels of readiness will help development projects get implemented \nwithout delays and thereby reduce accrual of commitment charges to the Government. \n \n11.  Capacity Building and Advisory Support across sectors, EAs and states. The TAC \nhas provided capacity development and project preparatory support to many less developed \nstates and new subsectors. Prominent sub-sectors which received project preparatory support \nwere municipal infrastructure, trade and investment infrastructure for the northeastern states, \nagribusiness infrastructure, tourism infrastructure, flood and riverbank erosion control, natural \nresource management, clean energy, and power transmission, in addition to transport and \nurban infrastructure development. Specific capacity development assistance was provided in \nclean  development  mechanism,  integrated  water  resource  management,  tourism  planning, \nenvironmental  planning,  hydropower  project  design,  environment  and  social  safeguards \nassessments,  international  credit  rating,  model  procurement  documents  for  public  private \npartnerships,  municipal  innovations  in  bankable  urban  sector  projects,  introduction  of  non \nsovereign  local  currency  lending  products  and  conducting  due  diligence  for  private  sector \noperations  of  ADB.    It  also  built  government  capacity  in  carrying  out  due  diligence  and \npreparation for loan projects on MFF. \n \n12.  The TAC has improved the planning and operational capacity of the executing agencies \nof the proposed follow-up loans in states like Bihar, Orissa, Mizoram, Chattisgarh, Jharkhand \nand Northeastern states.  \n \nC.   Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  As a cluster grant facility, the TAC financed 24 CTA projects under the ADB India \nprogram for 2006\u20132008. These CTAs supported a range of project preparatory and capacity-\nbuilding activities, including feasibility studies, preliminary designs, safeguard assessments, \ncapacity development, procurement support, detailed engineering designs, and project reports.  \n \n14.  The original TAC comprised 15 CTAs from the India program for 2006\u20132008 with an \noverall  allocation  of  $15  million,  including  TAC  administration  costs.  Subsequently,  on \nrecommendations  of  the  Joint  Task  Force  (JTF)  and  approval  of  the  CTA  papers  and \nimplementation plans by the Director General of the South Asia Department (SARD), the TAC \nwas expanded to include 24 CTAs.  \n \n15.  Of the original TA cluster of 15 CTAs, 12 of them were retained, and the following 3 \nCTAs were cancelled after JTF\u2019s  endorsement : \n\u2022  Capacity Development for the Rural Roads Sector ($200,000)  \n\u2022  Railway Sector Improvement Project II ($1,000,000) \n\u2022  Private Participation in the Energy Sector ($1,000,000) \n \n16.  Twelve new CTAs were developed and proposed for the consideration of the JTF2, \nmaking a total of 24 CTAs under the cluster grant facility. Once the JTF had endorsed the new \n                                                 \n2 This excludes the 2 CTAs which were included as new additions, but were dropped subsequently on JTF recommendation. These \nwere on National Housing Bank Limited ($200,000) and High-value crops and agro processing - opportunities and constraints in \nUttaranchal and Bihar ($250,000)  ", "  4\nCTAs, the TA papers / Implementation Plans of all CTAs were agreed with DEA and approved \nby DG, SARD in line with the TAC implementation arrangements.  \n \n17.    The revisions made in the CTAs reflect the Government\u2019s sectoral and project processing \npriorities with respect to ADB\u2019s operations and program in India. The revisions were based on (i) \nfeasibility of CTAs delivering project readiness by the completion date of the TAC; (ii) changes \nin  the  project  processing  schedule  of  the  Government  for  2006\u20132008;  (iii)  feedback  and \nconsultations with project executing agencies; (iv) reconsideration of the scope, suitability, and \nfocus of the CTAs; and (v) suggestions of the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) and ADB \nsector managers. Many CTAs had to substantially revise their scope of work due to shorter \ntimeframe available for implementation or other implementation and processing issues. Most \nCTAs were extended up to TA completion date of 30 June 2008 to compensate for delays in \nproject commencement or for accommodating additional scope of work requested by the EAs. \nAll additions and deletions were made within the total approved outlay of the TA cluster of $15 \nmillion. The revised list of CTAs included under the TAC is provided in Appendix 2. \n \n18.      Of the $15 million allocated, a total of $12.5 million was committed by 30 June 2008 and \n130 contracts were awarded. A total of $7 million had been disbursed by 31 May 2008, with the \nbalance expected to disburse within the DFID specified time frame of 31 December 2008.  \n \nD.   Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The $15 million TAC is financed by the Government of the United Kingdom on a grant \nbasis. The Government of India provided counterpart contributions in kind estimated at $4 \nmillion. The revisions to the original list of CTAs included under the TA cluster have had no \nimpact on the cost estimate and financing arrangements. The closure of the DFID financing on \n30 June 2008 compelled the closure of the TA cluster by this date.  \n \nE.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  Reduced project implementation period. The TAC was made effective on 25 July \n2006, within 1 month of Board approval. The TAC was implemented over a period of 24 months, \nfrom 1 July 2006 to 30 June 2008, instead of the originally envisaged 30 months completing on \n31 December 2008.  The 6 month reduction in implementation period was necessitated by \ntermination of the TAC financing from DFID. \n \n21.  The TAC is executed by the Department of Economic Affairs (DEA) and administered by \nthe India Resident Mission (INRM). The Joint Task Force (JTF) formed under the TAC has \nproactively guided the programming and implementation of the TAC. JTF comprised the joint \nsecretary and the director of the DEA, the country director INRM and the project team for the \nTAC, the SARD sector directors and the CTA project officers. The JTF met 5 times during TAC \nimplementation to review progress and steer and streamline the composition of the TAC. Based \non inputs from ADB staff, executing agencies, and the DEA, the JTF reviewed the relevance, \nimplementation schedule, and financial allocation of each CTA with respect to the India program \nfor 2006\u20132010, and recommended changes in the composition of the TAC.  \n \n22.  All project officers provided updates on the processing status and risks associated with \ntheir respective CTAs, to enable the JTF to take corrective action. As required, the CTA Project \nofficers prepared Board Information papers for individual CTAs. The project officers have also \ntaken steps to complete the ongoing contracts and affect financial closure thereafter.  \n ", "5   \n23.  International  and  national  consultants  were  engaged  through  130  contracts,  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to \ntime). A TAC completion report will be prepared for the TAC as a whole, based on the inputs \nprovided by the project officers of the component TAs.  \n \nIII.  CONCLUSION  \n \n24.  The TAC has responded well to Government\u2019s emphasis on the need for greater project \npreparedness  in  ADB  projects.  The  TAC  has  delivered  its  intended  outcomes,  namely, \nimproving project implementation readiness, strengthening local capacity and ownership, and \nenhancing the efficiency of project preparation and implementation. Each $1 million utilized \nunder the TAC has the potential of leveraging development investment of about $397 million. \n \n25.  Comprehensive  project  preparation  is  expected  to  reduce  delays  in  project \ncommencement after loan approval and lead to reduced accrual of commitment charges to the \nGovernment because of start-up delays.  \n \n26.  The Government has recognized the flexibility and responsiveness the TAC offers in \nrelation to improving project preparedness under ADB\u2019s India program. It has appreciated the \nTAC\u2019s  flexibility  in  addressing  the  advisory,  capacity\u2013building,  and  project  preparatory \nrequirements of new sectors and of the comparatively less developed states. The TAC has \nhighlighted the importance of supporting project readiness for timely and cost-effective delivery \nof ADB\u2019s India program.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  6\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nPerformance  Sources/Reporting \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks \nImpact       \nImprovement of project  Subproject approval from ADB  Approval  Assumption  \nimplementation  accelerated  percentages in the  Commitment by the \nreadiness     India program  Government  \n  Procurement and contract     \n  awards accelerated  Disbursement ratios   \n \nProject implementation unit \nestablished  \n \nOutcome        \n  Investment projects identified   Implementation  Assumptions \nAchievement of better    plans and TA papers  \u2022  Active cooperation by the \nefficiency and ownership  Private sector participation    executing agencies and \nin relation to project  increased  System to monitor  commitment to reform \npreparation and    project  \u2022  Willingness of the private \nimplementation   Consulting team mobilized and  implementation  sector to participate \n  counterpart staff appointed  readiness  \nPromotion of private  within the agreed time frame   \nparticipation     \n  Disbursement of funds and \n  implementation of project within \n  the agreed time frame achieved \naccelerated \n \nNumber of component TAs with \nprivate sector participation  \n \nOutputs       \n  1.
