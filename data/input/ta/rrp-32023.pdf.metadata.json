Justice is a function of the relationship between\ninstitutions responsible for delivering entitlements (public\ngoods  and  services)  predictably,  affordably,  and\naccountably,  and  the  ability  of  citizens  to  secure  and\nsustain their access to key sets of assets. The pro-poor\nrationale of this Program assumes that efforts to limit the\nvulnerability  of  the  poor  to  the  vagaries  of  systems  of\nadministrative, political, civil, and criminal justice are at\nleast  as  important  as  macroeconomic  performance  in\npoverty reduction. In addition, the present legal framework\nand  the  performance  of  judicial  institutions  significantly\nconstrain  market-based  economic  growth,  and  in\nparticular hinder foreign direct investment as well as the\ngrowth of small and medium-sized enterprises.\n     Objectives and Scope The key development objective of the AJP is to assist the\nGovernment  to  improve  access  to  justice  so  as  to\n(i) provide security and ensure equal protection under the\nlaw  to  citizens,  in  particular  the  poor;  (ii)  secure  and\nsustain  entitlements  and  thereby  reduce  the  poor's\nvulnerability;  (iii) strengthen  the  legitimacy  of  state\ninstitutions; and (iv) create conditions conducive to pro-\npoor growth, especially by fostering investor\u2019s confidence.\nThe Program will contribute to this aim by supporting five\ninter-related governance objectives: (i) providing a legal\nbasis  for  judicial,  policy,  and  administrative  reforms;\n(ii) improving the efficiency, timeliness, and effectiveness\nin  judicial1  and  police  services;  (iii) supporting  greater\n                  \n1  The term \u201cjudicial,\u201d unless the context indicates otherwise, includes institutions responsible for the delivery of\nadministrative justice, such as the offices of the ombudsman at various levels.", "ii\nequity  and  accessibility  in  justice  services  for  the\nvulnerable  poor;  (iv)  improving  predictability  and\nconsistency between fiscal and human resource allocation\nand  the  mandates  of  reformed  judicial  and  police\ninstitutions at the federal, provincial and local government\nlevels;  and  (v) ensuring  greater  transparency  and\naccountability  in  the  performance  of  the  judiciary,  the\npolice and administrative justice institutions.\n     Classification Poverty Intervention\nThematic: Good Governance\n                 Gender and Development\n     Social Issues The AJP is a key part of nationwide efforts to positively\ninfluence  the  exercise  of  political,  administrative  and\njudicial power so as to improve the accessibility of public\nentitlements for all citizens, in particular the poor, women,\nand  minorities.  Although  no  adverse  social  impact  is\nanticipated, the AJP will actively prompt critical public and\nprofessional debate about important social issues and will\nbe  one  modest  part  of  larger  efforts  to  transform  the\nculture of governance in Pakistan.\n     Gender and Development The AJP will tackle gender issues through the creation of\ncompetent  legal,  judicial  and  police  institutions  through\nwhich  existing  basic/constitutional  rights  can  be\nimplemented  fairly  and  accountably.  Through  the\nreformed  Law  Commission  as  well  as  the  Women's\nCommission, the AJP will promote research and debate\non the quality and equality of existing laws and through\nthis  help  build  constituencies  for  change  and  build\nconsensus for reform. The institutional focus will articulate\ngender  interests  through  the  focus  on  the  quality  of\nservices delivered by government and judicial institutions\nand, on the \u201cdemand\u201d side, on the empowerment focus of\nthe AJP. Concrete steps will include revision of service\nrules for judges to remove gender biases and facilitate the\ninduction  of  more  women  judges,  offering  of  special\ncourses for potential women judges, and training courses\nin  gender  sensitization  for  the  judiciary  and  police,\ncoupled  with  service  rules  that  promote  gender\nsensitization.  Civil  society  groups  engaged  in  legal\nempowerment  activities  will  be  eligible  to  tap  funding\nunder the Legal Empowerment Fund (LEF). Thus, through\na combination of policy changes, capacity building, and\nsupport for civil society initiatives, the AJP will begin to\naddress serious gender issues in the legal system.\n     Environmental Issues No  adverse  environmental  impact  is  anticipated.\nConsistent with its institutional focus, the AJP will support\nthe  enforcement  of  environmental  laws  through  the\nestablishment of environmental tribunals already provided", "iii\nfor in the law, and by ensuring that any conflict of interest\nis removed by different persons heading the provincial\nenvironmental  protection  agencies  (EPAs)  and  the\nprovincial  environment  departments.  In  addition,  civil\nsociety groups will be able to access the LEF to raise\nenvironmental  awareness  and  provide  assistance  for\nenforcement of environmental rights.\nADB Financing\nLoan Amount and Terms (i)  A  loan  of  \u00a529,685,000,000  (equivalent  to\nUS$243.2  million)  from  ADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital\nresources  with  amortization  over  15  years,\nincluding a grace period of 3 years, an interest rate\ndetermined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-\nbased  facility,  a  commitment  charge  of  0.75\npercent per annum, a front end fee of 1.0 percent\n(the fee will be capitalized in the loan), conversion\noptions, and such other terms and conditions as\nare substantially in accordance with the those set\nforth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the\nBoard.\n(ii)  A  loan  of  SDR67,914,000  (US$86.8  million\nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources\nwith a term of 24 years, including a grace period of\n8 years. Interest of 1.0 percent per annum will be\ncharged during the grace period, and 1.5 percent\nper annum thereafter.\nProgram Period and Program period will be from December 2001 to December\n    Tranching 2004.\nThe  loan  will  be  released  in  four  tranches,  with  equal\ndisbursements  from  the  OCR  and  Special  Funds\nresources  loans.  The  first  tranche  of  \u00a57,714,192,000\n(equivalent to US$63.2 million) and SDR28,793,000 will\nbe released upon loan effectiveness. An incentive tranche\nof  \u00a53,051,500,000  (equivalent  to  US$25  million)  and\nSDR19,561,000 will be released by 30 June 2002, and the\nsecond tranche of \u00a59,154,500,000 (equivalent to US$75\nmillion)  and  SDR19,560,000,  and  third  tranche  of\n\u00a59,764,808,000  (equivalent  to  US$80  million)  will  be\nreleased  by  30  June  2003  and  31  December  2004,\nrespectively,  subject  to  compliance  with  the  tranche\nrelease conditions and satisfactory performance reviews.\nExecuting and The  Ministry  of  Law,  Justice,  Human  Rights  and\n            Implementing Agencies Parliamentary Affairs (MOL) will be the Executing Agency.\nA program management unit (PMU) will be established in\nMOL. At the Federal level, the Implementing Agencies will\nbe (i) the Law Commission, (ii) the Federal Ombudsman,\n(iii) the Federal Judicial Academy, and (iv) the Ministry of", "iv\nInterior. At the provincial level, the Province Implementing\nAgencies will be the departments of law and home, with\nthe planning and development department/board playing a\ncoordination role. The provincial implementing agencies\nwill work with (i) the provincial ombudsman, (ii) the High\nCourt,  (iii)  the  provincial  public  safety  commission,  as\nappropriate.\nProcurement The proceeds of the policy loan will be used to finance the\nforeign exchange costs of items produced in and from\nADB member countries other than items specified in the\nprohibited items list and imports financed by other bilateral\nand multilateral sources.\nThe Technical Assistance Loan A TA cluster loan will support Institutional Development for\nAccess to Justice. It will be implemented in three phases,\nallowing each phase to respond to particular needs during\nimplementation of the AJP. Activities in the first phase will\nfocus  on  (i)  governance  structures,  systems,  and\ncapacities to articulate policy/laws; (ii) public knowledge\nand empowerment; (iii) performance and accountability;\n(iv)  policy  impact  and  innovation;  and  (v)  supporting\nfurther legal and policy reform. MOL will be the Executing\nAgency.\nThe  TA  loan  of  SDR15,648,000  (US$20  million\nequivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources will have\na term of 32 years, including a grace period of 8 years.\nInterest of 1.0 percent per annum will be charged during\nthe grace period, and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter.\nTechnical Assistance Grant A TA grant equivalent to $900,000 will be provided from\nthe ADB-funded TA program to support the PMU and an\nindependent monitoring and evaluation system.\nProgram Benefits The AJP will deliver benefits in three domains. Actions in\nthe first domain, policy and legal provisions, will secure\n(i) greater  judicial  independence,  transparency,  and\naccountability;  (ii)  better  citizen  state  relations;  and\n(iii) more  durable  public  institutions  responsible  for  the\ndelivery of justice. Actions in the domain of institutional\nperformance  will  result  in:  (i)  greater  judicial\nindependence,  fostering  the  predictable,  timely  and\nimpartial rule of law conducive to investor confidence; (ii)\na  dramatic  decline  in  political  interference  in  police\nservices;  (iii)  enhanced  institutional  arrangements  for\nholding  public  servants  and  officials  accountable  for\nviolations  of  citizens\u2019  rights  and  entitlements;  and  (iv)\ngreater public engagement in planning and monitoring the\nperformance  of  judicial  and  police  service  delivery.\nActions  in  the  third  domain,  budget/expenditure\nmanagement, will result in greater consistency between\nallocations of human and fiscal resources and institutional", "v\nresponsibilities  for  the  delivery  of  justice  at  federal,\nprovincial,  and  local  government  levels.  The  AJP  will\ncontribute to the Government's efforts to transform the\nperformance of the judiciary and the police such that the\ncitizenry will regard these institutions as the important for\nthe assertion and protection of their rights, while the poor\nwill feel confident to use them to reduce their vulnerability.\nWhile  the  benefits  of  the  improved  rule  of  law  are\nindispensable to improve economic performance, the AJP\nwill decrease vulnerability for the poor in substantial ways\nincluding  (i) alleviating  the  vulnerability  arising  from\neveryday harassment, underperformance, exclusion, and\ndenial of basic rights by public officials; (ii) easing the\nvulnerability of informal sector activities to rent-seeking\nactivities  of  officials  responsible  for  licensing  and\nregulating  people's  access  to  economic  and\nenvironmental assets; (iv) improving the accountability of\npublic  officials,  and  improving  the  accessibility  and\naffordability of public goods and services on which the\npoor rely disproportionately.\nSafeguards and Risks Three  factors  present  particular  risks  to  the  reform\nprocess,  each  of  which  is  only  marginally  within  the\ncapacity of the AJP to mitigate: (i) the fiscal crisis will\nmake  it  extremely  difficult  for  the  Government  to\nadequately and predictably resource the reforms over the\nnext decade; (ii) implementing government commitments\nto  reform  will  depend  on  corresponding  constituencies\nbeing created among provinces and local governments\nand on the facilitation of broad coalitions and alliances\nwith civil society; and (iii) the window of opportunity for\nreforms,  through  to  October  2002,  is  vulnerable  to\nuncertainty, within both Pakistan and the region. While the\nAJP  design,  in  particular  the  TA  loan,  will  assist  in\nameliorating risks relating to (ii) above, the other risks are\nbeyond the capacity of the AJP to mitigate. Furthermore,\nthe heightened sense of instability and uncertainty created\nby the present regional crisis will undoubtedly impact on\nthe law, order, and security situation within Pakistan that it\nis the purpose of this program to improve.", "I.  THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on proposed\nfinancing comprising the following three loans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the Access\nto Justice Program (AJP): (i) two policy loans to support the AJP; and (ii) a technical assistance\n(TA) loan to support Institutional Development for Access to Justice. The Report also describes\nproposed TA for Supporting and Monitoring Progress under the AJP, and if the proposed loans\nare approved by the Board, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, shall\napprove this TA on a grant basis.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. Governance has emerged as Pakistan\u2019s foremost development priority. Corruption and\npolitical instability in the 1990s have resulted in waning business confidence, lower economic\ngrowth, increasing poverty, and a serious undermining of state institutions and the rule of law.\nCentral  to  this  malaise  is  the  alienation  of  the  citizenry  from  the  state  and  a  feeling  of\ndisempowerment against abuse of power by officials.\n3. Central to the Government's commitment to governance reforms is strengthening the\nrule of law and reforming key institutions. The local government plan, put into effect on 14\nAugust 2001, has as one of its objectives to bring \u201cjustice to the doorstep\u201d of the people. The\nlong-term impact of these reforms is uncertain, but the present Government's commitment, in\nboth policy rhetoric and practice, and in the broad-ranging scope of the reforms suggests\nreadiness  to  confront  serious  constraints  to  reforms  that  have  eluded  Pakistan  since\nIndependence. The most serious constraints are found in the political culture, and in sanctions\nand incentives bearing on the judiciary, police, and administration. The judiciary has been\nrepeatedly compromised by political practices, and has not garnered the necessary degree of\nindependence from the executive, especially in terms of securing an adequate and predictable\nlevel of resourcing. Similarly, the police services remain affected by a colonial legacy that sets\nthem in an oppressive relationship with the citizenry as the police are forced to extract non-\nformal payments from citizens to secure even basic police services.\n4. Governance reforms in Pakistan have been opposed by powerful pro-status quo vested\ninterests. The severe fiscal deficit puts additional restraints on a reform agenda. But Pakistan's\nlong term economic recovery depends on the effectiveness of governance reforms. The AJP\naddresses  some  of  the  most  fundamental  reforms  necessary  for  improved  governance,\nincluding greater transparency and accountability of officials, improved public access to basic\nentitlements, and more predictable and adequate resourcing for the fundamental public good of\nlaw and order. The agreement on the AJP Program Loan is reflected in the Government\u2019s\nDevelopment Policy Letter and the attached Policy Matrix and Performance Review in Appendix\n1.\n5. Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  support  for  legal  and  judicial  reform  in  Pakistan\ncomprises  two  completed  TAs1  and  two  ongoing  ones.2  Reform  proposals  have  been\nindigenously  driven  through  multilayered  stakeholder  participation.  A  Fact-Finding  Mission\nvisited Pakistan in 1999. Processing was suspended due to the change in regime and political\nuncertainties. After resumption of dialogue with the new Government and ADB\u2019s further TA\n                  \n1  TA  2979-PAK: Strengthening Government Legal Services and the Subordinate Judiciary,  for  US$150,000,\napproved on 31 December 1997; and TA 3015-PAK: Legal and Judicial Reform Project, for US$995,000, approved\non 7 May 1998.\n2  TA 3433-PAK: Strengthening of Institutional Capacity for Judicial and Legal Reform, for US$2,900,000, approved\non 27 April 2000; and TA 3640-PAK: Supporting Access to Justice under the Local Government Plan, for\nUS$150,000, approved on 19 March 2001.", "2\nsupport, another Fact-finding Mission3 visited Pakistan from 20 June to 11 July 2001, followed\nby an Appraisal Mission from 20 August to 12 September 20014 to firm up the scope of and\nimplementation arrangements for AJP.\nIII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT\nA.  The Economy\n6. Pakistan faces severe macroeconomic imbalances, declining economic growth, rising\npoverty, and underdeveloped human capital. During the 1990s, the fiscal deficit and the current\naccount deficit as proportions of the gross domestic product (GDP) averaged 6.9 percent and\n4.5 percent, respectively. The average economic growth rate decelerated from 6.5 percent in\nthe 1980s to 5.4 percent in the first half of the 1990s, and to 3.6 percent during the last few\nyears. The incidence of poverty increased from less than 20 percent in the late-1980s to over 35\npercent today.\n7. During  FY2001,  the  Government  continued  to  pursue  macroeconomic  stabilization\npolicies coupled with structural reform, and the GDP growth was estimated at nearly 2.6 percent\nthat year. In addition, the savings and investment rates, at less than 15 percent of GDP in 2001,\nremained low, and the agriculture sector continued to dominate the economy. Inflation, as\nmeasured by changes in the Consumer Price Index, was 4.4 percent in FY2001 as against 3.6\npercent in FY2000. The higher inflation in FY2001 is mainly attributable to an increase in\npetroleum prices. The drought (which ended only recently), weak external demand, falling\ncommodity prices, and persistently high world oil prices adversely affected Pakistan\u2019s external\nsector performance. Declining unit prices of Pakistan exports resulted in failure to meet the\nexport target of US$10 billion estimated for FY2001. The budget deficit of 5.2 percent for\nFY2001 was the lowest fiscal deficit in 20 years. In FY2001, revenue collection increased by 12\npercent. Despite this growth in tax collection, overall tax revenue collection in FY2001 was 10\npercent lower than the target.\n8. Crises in the management of public finances and external balances dominated the\neconomic policy agenda in Pakistan during the 1990s. However, despite all efforts, and three\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) programs between 1988 and 1999, adequate progress was\nnot made in addressing the macroeconomic imbalances. Frequent changes of government\nduring this period contributed to uneven commitment to reform, with an attendant negative\nimpact on growth. The imposition of economic sanctions following the nuclear tests of May 1998\nseriously affected an economy already weakened by a large public debt.\n9. Chronic fiscal and external deficits have resulted in accumulation of large domestic and\nexternal debt. Total debt (both domestic and external) equaled 115 percent of GDP in FY2001,\nand  interest  payments  on  total  debt  accounted  for  almost  50  percent  of  the  total  current\nexpenditure of the Government. Of Pakistan\u2019s \u201ctwin\u201d debt problem, the external debt is the more\ncritical issue for short to medium term economic management. In FY 1998, the ratio of external\ndebt servicing to export earnings was nearly 35 percent and even after debt rescheduling, the\n                  \n3  The Fact-Finding Mission comprised H. Sharif, Senior Counsel (Co-Mission Leader); D. Porter, Senior Governance\nSpecialist, Program Department (West), Office of the Director; and B. Murg, Intern, Office of the General Counsel.\nMr. H.J Yu, Senior Programs Officer (Co-Mission Leader) joined the Mission from 9 to 11 July 2001.\n4  The  Mission  comprised  Messrs.  Hamid  Sharif,  Senior  Counsel  (Co-Mission  Leader),  Doug  Porter,  Senior\nGovernance Specialist, and Bradley Murg, Intern, Office of the General Counsel (20 August to 1 September 2001).\nMr. H.J Yu, Senior Programs Officer (Co-Mission Leader) joined the Mission from 21 to 24 August and 4 to\n12 September 2001. Mr. Sultan Hafeez Rahman, Manager, PW1 assisted the Mission for high level dialogue from\n6 to 12 September 2001.", "3\nexternal debt service ratio in FY2001 was over 23 percent. As of 30 June 2001, Pakistan\u2019s total\noutstanding external debt is estimated at PRs2,224 billion ($36 billion).\n10. In the backdrop of such heavy indebtedness, Pakistan negotiated IMF Standby Program\namounting to US$600 million in November 2000. Pakistan has successfully completed this\nprogram  as  indicated  in  IMF\u2019s  last  review  in  September  2001.  The  country  is  currently\nnegotiating a Poverty Reduction Growth Facility Program with IMF, to be put in place by the end\nof 2001.\n11. The terrorist acts in the United States (US) on 11 September 2001 have dramatically\naltered the situation in Pakistan. The Government\u2019s immediate and strong support of the US\ngovernment in its war on global terrorism has resulted in the lifting of sanctions by the US as\nwell as by Canada. The US has committed a US$600 million financial package and has plans to\nprovide substantially more assistance. Other governments have pledged an increase in aid. The\nUS and other key funders have also offered to reschedule or forgive substantial amounts of\nPakistan\u2019s  bilateral  debt.    While  there  is  expected  to  be  an  increased  inflow  of  financial\nassistance, the tensions in the region have placed Pakistan\u2019s exports under pressure, as export\norders are being cancelled in such key items as cotton, which is Pakistan\u2019s most important\nexport crop. The import trade is also being disrupted, as some international carriers, due to a\nlack of coverage for war risk, are refusing port calls to Pakistan. Apart from the impacts on the\ntrade side and the balance of payments, the fiscal deficit and inflation could rise. A general\nweakening of confidence would also put pressure on the exchange rate. These effects would\nforce a further slowdown in GDP growth, estimated at only 2.9 percent in FY2001, which could\nderail prospects of a recovery over the medium term.\nB.  Poverty and Justice in Pakistan\n12. It is generally accepted that poverty fell through the 1980s, but rose again over the\n1990s to 30-34 percent of the population.5 Poverty in Pakistan appears to exhibit seven features\nof direct relevance to the approach and rationale of the AJP. First, income distribution is\nrelatively  equal  compared  with  countries  of  similar  income  level.6  Second,  although  the\nincidence of poverty is high, turnover among the poor is also rapid. In one study, 46-51 percent\nof households left the category of \u201cpoverty\u201d from one year to the next. Rather than focusing on\nthe symptoms of poverty (such as income gap or social sector indicators), this suggests a focus\non the probable causes of entry and exit into poverty. Third, although rural areas appear to have\na higher incidence of poverty than urban areas, several studies report a trend towards the\nopposite, partly as a result of rapid urbanization (now 36 percent), which is high for South Asia\n(28 percent). Fourth, a large proportion of the poor are dependent on informal sector wage\nlabor.\n13. The fifth and sixth features of poverty in Pakistan provide further focus on vulnerability.\nWhile relatively egalitarian in terms of \u201cincome poverty,\u201d the capacity of the poor to access\npublic  entitlements\u2013like  political  processes  or  goods  and  services  that  determine  human\ndevelopment\u2013contrasts strikingly with that of the rich. For instance, literacy, which is critically\nimportant in awareness of and access to entitlements, is highly unequal. There are tremendous\ndisparities in human development (defined as enlarging people's choices in a way that enables\nthem to lead longer, healthier and fuller lives). Most key indicators, like infant mortality, fertility,\npopulation growth, literacy rates and primary school enrollment remain low compared with the\n                  \n5  At least four caveats are in order: (i) there is no consistent interpretation of poverty, or a \u201cpoverty line\u201d in Pakistan;\n(ii) multiple, conflicting methodologies makes comparative analysis difficult; (iii) the quality of studies is variable;\nand (iv) data is of poor quality.\n6  Income inequality appears to have fallen in the 1960s, increased in the 1970s, fallen in the early and middle\n1980s, and fallen again in the 1990s. The Gini coefficient in 1997/98 was 0.40.", "4\naverage for low-income countries, and most indicators are markedly worse for women and girls.\nFinally, and not least important, a seventh feature stands out in the poor's perceptions of\npoverty: they highlight increasing insecurity and vulnerability arising from sectarian violence,\ncommunal clashes, and declining law and order.\n1. Poverty, Governance, and Vulnerability\n14. Poverty reflects social and political processes that are mediated through a range of\ninstitutions. Typically, institutional \u201cfailure\u201d is generalized as a \u201cproblem of governance.\u201d While\nPakistan enjoyed significant annual GDP growth for over 50 years (1947-1997), the control of\npolitical power and government by a small elite ensured that institutionalized decision making\nwas  irrelevant  to  the  wider  needs  of  the  population  and,  as  a  consequence,  poverty  has\nremained widespread.7\n15. The existence of high-quality public institutions that mediate people's access to services\nessential for human, physical, and financial capital is as important as the assets themselves.\nThe capacity of public institutions indeed strongly influences whether a state is \u201cdevelopmental\u201d\nor \u201cpredatory\u201d, a key theme in the AJP. Understanding the relationship among \u201cgovernance,\u201d\npoverty, and vulnerability from the viewpoint of the poor highlights two points relevant to the\nrationale for the AJP. First, while poverty manifests as material deprivation\u2013hunger, the lack of\nfood, shelter, clothing\u2013the poor also highlight common psychological and political dimensions to\npoverty\u2013lack of power and voice; feelings of dependency, shame, and humiliation. Poor people\nhighlight lack of access to basic infrastructure and services. But whereas official accounts of\npoverty highlight the difference between rich and poor in indicators of educational, health, or\nother standards of attainment, the poor rarely have such a static view of what is required in their\nlives. Education is valued, for instance, but only if it offers an escape from poverty, not in its own\nright. Lack of access to affordable, effective health care is dreaded, not just as a source of ill\nhealth, important though that is, but as a source of vulnerability and, ultimately, destitution.\nFinally, while the poor are concerned about lack of income, they frequently attribute this to the\nconstraints they face in managing their assets (human, material, social, political), through which\nthey cope with their vulnerability.\n16. Second,  most  poor  people  recognize  that  the  state  has  responsibilities  to  provide\naffordable, effective, and equitable public goods and services. They feel the government has\nfailed to deliver and indeed that their interactions with local state institutions are marked by\nrudeness, humiliation, harassment, and corruption. The poor often perceive their interactions\nwith these agencies as increasing their vulnerability to erosion of important household, political,\ncivil, natural resource, and social assets. Globally, the impact of a brutalizing police force and a\ncorrupt judiciary is, for instance, remarked by the poor far more often than is attended to in\nofficial accounts of indicators and causes of poverty focusing, for instance, on access to health\nor  education.8  These  intermediating  institutions,  in  particular  those  of  the  local  state,  are\nparticularly demoralizing for the poor, who already feel defenseless against the power of the\nstate and the elite.\n                  \n7  Husain, I. 1999: Pakistan: The Economy of an Elitist State, Oxford University Press, Oxford.\n8 This refers to global experience. In Pakistan, comparative research is only beginning. For instance, under a\nCIET/NRB survey of over 10,000 respondents (CIET 2001: 'Community Monitoring of public services and human\nrights - summaries' draft results), 52-60 percent of respondents were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with police\nservices, compared with 38-40 percent with the courts, 28 percent with government health services, and around\n15% with primary education.", "5\n2. Institutions and Access to Justice\n17. In most aspects of their lives, the poor rely on informal justice and dispute resolution\nforum that in some respects have been more effective than formal mechanisms. In Pakistan,\nthis is especially true, although for the population overall, it appears that the courts remain the\nmost popular forums for dispute resolution.9 Local panchayats (traditional council of elders/\nleaders) are popular, in the main for their ability to maintain peace and harmony, their low cost,\nand their link to local communities and families. Panchayats tend not to be known for their\ncommitment to the truth or ability to avoid vested interests. While the informal legal system\noffers  cheaper  resolution  of  disputes,  it  is  more  difficult  to  enforce  decisions,  and  its\ndeliberations are frequently manipulated by local elites (i.e., members of the dominant faction);\nas a result the panchayats are unable to hear both parties on an equal basis. Furthermore, the\ninformal  legal  system  is  insufficient  for  adequate  market-based  economic  growth,  and\nconstrains significant foreign direct investment as well as the growth of small- and medium-\nsized enterprises.10\n18. The vulnerable poor are especially affected by their relations with a dysfunctional and\npredatory local state. It is at this level that the connection between vulnerability and governance\nhas its greatest meaning. It is at this interface that dispensation of justice in the wider sense fails\nand  disempowers,  particularly  the  poor.  Vulnerability  is  exacerbated  by  the  everyday\nharassment, underperformance, exclusion, and denial of basic rights by public officials of people\nwho are disadvantaged by virtue of gender, ethnicity, or economic or political power. This\nsource of vulnerability is marked in three aspects of the lives of the poor. Vulnerability is much\nincreased by local officials responsible for licensing and regulating economic activities who\ntypically extract rent from informal sector workers. Further, and well known, the vulnerability of\nthe poor is continually reaffirmed by the corruption of local cadre/officials that hampers access\nto public goods and services \u2013 health, education, land management, etc. Finally, the failure of\ngovernment institutions to provide law and order and security is a function of the existent police,\nlegal, and judicial structures.\nIV.  SECTOR CONTEXT\nA.  Background and Recent Performance\n19. Vulnerability is greatly effected by the performance of public institutions responsible for\nfour domains of justice, viz., judicial, policing, administrative, and political. These institutions of\nthe provincial and local government act on, influence, or control the conditions under which the\npoor can secure, and sustain, assets that determine their vulnerability.\n1.  Judiciary\n20. In Pakistan today, the level of public confidence in the judiciary, and especially the\nsubordinate district courts, threatens its institutional legitimacy.11 The basic legitimacy of the\nlegal and judicial system matters a great deal to Pakistan's economic, political and social\ndevelopment and is profoundly important to improved access to justice in the administrative and\n                  \n9  Research sponsored under TA 3640-PAK: Supporting Access to Justice Under the Local Government Plan, for\nUS$150,000, approved on 18 October 2001, preliminary results.\n10 Greif, Avner. 1994. \u201cContracting, Enforcement, and Efficiency: Economic Beyond the Law.\u201d Proceedings of the\nAnnual Bank Conference on Development Economics, Washington D.C.  The World Bank.\n11 The Asia Foundation. 1999: \u201cPakistan Legal and Judicial Reform Project,\u201d ADB, Integrated Report, September\n1999, p.25. A brief description of Pakistan\u2019s legal and judicial system is provided in the Board paper for TA 3433-\nPAK.", "6\npolitical realms. The vast majority of Pakistanis, ranging from businesspeople to vulnerable\ngroups,  share  a  common  bond\u2013they  eschew  lawlessness  and  desire  a  more  predictable\nenvironment in which to conduct their affairs. \"The interests of powerful investment houses and\npowerless  Pakistani  citizens  in  a  functioning  legal  system  are  not  mutually  exclusive.\nPredictability and fairness are the hallmarks of a legal system that works.\"12\n21. The  basic  problems  of  judicial  administration  in  Pakistan  relate  to  governance  and\nadministration,  case  management  and  delay  reduction,  automation  and  court  information\nsystems, human resources, and infrastructure. The practical manifestations of these problems\nin Pakistan include the following:\n(i)  A high percentage of cases are filed but not dismissed,\n(ii)  Few cases are settled before trial (90 percent go to trial),\n(iii)  A high level of \"unmet demand\" is revealed by those who would access the\ncourts with meritorious claims but for the unpredictable results that attend the\napplication  (unpredictability  being  a  core  element  of  illegitimacy  in  judicial\norgans),\n(iv)  Related to the previous point, confidence in the courts is so low that it provides\nthe perverse incentive to aggrieved parties to remain so, rather than accessing\nthe courts, or even threatening to access the courts (because the threat provides\nno meaningful inducement for the injurer to settle),\n(v)  A high percentage of cases are appealed,\n(vi)  Judgments enjoy virtually no voluntary compliance; few judgements are self-\nexecuting, and the execution of judgement is woefully delinquent, if it happens at\nall,\n(vii)  The legal/judicial system provides little, if any, socially beneficial deterrence,\n(viii)  The motivation to sue, and the ultimate goal of litigation, is mostly to delay,\n(ix)  Risk allocation mechanisms, such as insurance, are woefully underdeveloped,\n(x)  Self-help in criminal cases is traditional and sanctioned, in part, by law; criminal\nprosecution for resort to self-help is unlikely, and conviction absolutely remote,\n(xi)  Information known about the other party's case is virtually nil except through the\ntrial medium (less than 2 percent of cases have any discovery whatsoever).\n2.  Police\n22. A large body of research suggests that weak property rights amplify poverty. But the rule\nof law underpins more than property and contractual rights; in a society where up to 40 percent\nof  the  population  are  judged  as  living  in  poverty,  and  in  effect  unable  to  access  their\nentitlements through the administrative, judicial, or political systems, this powerlessness both\nmanifests in and exacerbates lawlessness. Ironically, while the just and effective application of\nlaws governing people's access to basic entitlements is highlighted in the poor's accounts of\n                  \n12 Pakistan 2010 Study: an Agenda for More Effective Governance, 1998, p. 41.", "7\npoverty, analysis of and support to institutions responsible for delivery of this primary 'public\ngood has, until the present ADB initiative, been greatly underplayed in externally supported\ngovernment  poverty  reduction  efforts.13  It  has  now  been  acknowledged  that  a  weak  and\nunaccountable police forces weakens social cohesion, and greatly increases poor people's\nvulnerability in terms of access to public services, economic livelihoods, and law and order.\nDisintegration  of  institutional  checks  and  balances  on  police  action  can  lead  to  immense\nrepression and exploitation.\n23. Declining  professionalism,  weak  incentive  and  sanction  systems,  and  political\ninterference have over time eroded the capacity of law enforcement agencies, particularly the\npolice. This has contributed to the difficulty of making informal sector survival strategies work,\nas small traders cannot be guaranteed the protection of law and may even be harassed by law\nenforcing agencies. The average cost of police services\u2013charges made on the public\u2013is on the\norder of PRs30,000-35,000 per episode.14 The severest form of injustice affecting the poor is\npolice harassment of individuals. Minority or socially excluded groups are particularly vulnerable\nto police extortion and harassment. Patronage can be solicited, but this often forces the poor to\nsell their assets, thus pushing them further into poverty, humiliation, and silence.\n24. Lack  of  professionalism  in  the  police  force  makes  people  vulnerable  to  threats,\nintimidation, and abuse from those in power. Together with weak social cohesion, declining\nconfidence in police, and an inadequate accountability system, this severely constrains people's\nability to hold officials to account, access public services, and sustain informal sector economic\nlivelihoods. A recent focal group tasked under the seven-point reform agenda announced in\nOctober 1999, comprising civil and police officers, lawyers, journalists, and members of the\npublic,  concluded  that  the  police  were  incapable  of  confronting  the  challenges  posed  by\nfundamental changes in the nature and extent of crime due in large measure to an outdated\nlegal and institutional framework, and arbitrary and whimsical mismanagement of the police by\nthe executive authority of the government at every level.\n25. Since its creation under the Police Act of 1861, the predominant function of the police\nhas  been  simply  to  control.  From  its  inception,  police  mandates  were  not  funded.  This\nencouraged rent-seeking and extortion, which continue. Police mandates are still unfunded, with\nthe average budget for a police station per year being a mere PRs8,000 (US$120), and the\nforensic capacity of the police limited to distinguishing between human and animal blood.\n26. Politicization has debilitated professionalism of the police force. This has weakened its\ncapacity to serve the rule of law. Furthermore, an alliance between the local political elite, the\ndistrict administration, and the magistracy (under the control of the executive) has undermined\nconstitutional  rights  and  other  protections  provided  under  the  law.  Recruitment  based  on\npolitical patronage or corruption has led to a grave loss of public confidence in the police.\n27. Prosecution functions are split among the provincial police, the department of law, and\nthe Office of the Advocate General. Arraignment procedures and lower classes of offenses are\nhandled  by  police  sub-inspectors.  The  current  prosecution  service  is  understaffed  and\nundertrained.  Lack  of  operational  independence  enhances  the  misuse  of  the  office,  and\nfacilitates political influence and prosecutorial misconduct. All of this has resulted in a conviction\nrate of 37 percent or even less in some provinces, well below the international average. This\n                  \n13 The initiatives and recommendations under the AJP have also been incorporated recently in the current draft\nInterim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (Ministry of Finance, July 2001), which is perhaps the first official\nrecognition of the links between policing and poverty.\n14 CIET/NRB survey of over 10,000 respondents (CIET 2001: 'Community Monitoring of public services and human\nrights - summaries' draft results).", "8\nhas decreased public trust in the legal system, while increasing the propensity of criminals to\ncommit crimes.\n3.  Administrative Services\n28. Analysis of the performance of administrative services reveals serious inadequacies.\nFirst, while the poor rely on public services (health, education, etc.), utilization is low as a result\nof poor delivery, access constraints due to corruption, and poor service-orientation of staff.\nSecond, the capacity of government to convert scarce resources into services is poor.15 Third,\nthe imposition of extra-legal taxes, fees, and other payments for all services places enormous\nburdens on the poor. Many households borrow large sums of money, sell assets, and/or remove\nchildren from school to meet the expense of poor quality public services.\n29. The  office  of  the  Federal  Ombudsman  was  established  in  1981  to  deal  with\n\u201cmaladministration,\u201d  including  corruption,  and  to  improve  the  responsiveness  of  public\ninstitutions. The system, now extended to all provinces except North West Frontier Province\n(NWFP), has provided some relief in individual cases, but has not dealt with systemic failures\nthat lead to individual grievances in the first place. The number of complaints filed with the\nFederal Ombudsman against officials more than tripled during 1985-1998. Most complaints\nrelated to public utilities. The proportion of complaints concerning arbitrary decisions has risen\nprecipitously.  Complaints  are  placed  in  one  of  five  categories:  delay,  inattention,  neglect,\narbitrary decisions, and corruption.16 While alarming, these trends say nothing of those who are\nactually silenced by dysfunctional institutions:\nIf anybody complains or protests against this corruption, they are struck off the\nlists of all support services, because it is the same Local Zakat Committee that\nrecommends names for the assistance programs run by different Government\nDepartments.17\n30. Among the administrative issues most important to the vulnerable poor, in particular to\nindigenous people, are land titling and property rights. The current system of cadastral mapping,\ntitling, and registration leads to manipulation by the relatively well off and erodes the expansion\nof property rights to the poor.  The result has been a massive influx of land-related cases to the\ncourts. Due to the antiquated system in which entries in the registers are rebuttable, claims and\ncounterclaims continue for years and often lead to criminal cases. These civil and criminal\ncases add to the growing delays in courts.\n4.  Political Justice\n31. Better enforcement of political rights has been shown, across the board, to reduce the\npotential for conflict, thereby averting major sources of social and economic vulnerability for the\npoor. Throughout Pakistan's modern history, participation in the exercise of political rights and\nentitlements has been limited, and women and the poor in particular lack a political voice.\nConcentration of power at the federal and provincial levels has limited broader participation\nwhich has led to overrepresentation of feudal and business interests. Local government bodies\n                  \n15 The unit costs of local service in education, for instance, are about 40 percent higher in Pakistan than in\ncomparable countries, and dropout rates are high, both indicating substantial wastage of public resources.

Chuard. 1996: \"Analysis of drop-out and student learning in primary education in Pakistan\u201d Asian\nDevelopment Bank, Manila.\n16 The Asia Foundation. 1999: \u201cPakistan Legal and Judicial Reform Project,\u201d ADB, Integrated Report, September, p.\n145.\n17 Narayan, D. et al. 2000: Voices of the Poor: Can Anyone Hear Us?

The\nrepresentation of the poor, women, and minorities is negligible even in school committees,\nmosque committees, market committees, dispute adjudication committees, etc. in both rural and\nurban areas. The voice of the women is often muted.\n32. Through  devolution  under  the  new  local  government  structure,  the  Government  is\ncommitted to a citizen-oriented, transparent, and accountable government. Elections for the\nlocal government bodies (which have a mandatory 30 percent representation for women and\nguaranteed representation of labor) have been completed, and the establishment of the intricate\nnetwork  of  local  government  institutions  is  now  under  way.  The  Government  has  also\nannounced for a return to democracy, with elections to be held in October 2002.\nB.  Constraints and Issues\n33. At least eight law reform commissions have been constituted since 1958 to review the\nadministration of justice in Pakistan.18 Many have contained unassailable recommendations.\nWhy have these not been implemented? Lack of political will is important, but the reasons are\nmore complex. Three reasons can be cited. First, political and economic instability provide fertile\nground for compromising rules as different groups compete for security. Second, just as repeat\ntransactions in the private realm build trust, repeat non-implementation in the public realm\nbreeds distrust and erodes legitimacy. Third, institutional reform in such an environment is\ndifficult.  Confidence-building  measures  must  be  consistently,  responsively,  and  flexibly\nsequenced, to pierce the veil of cynicism, and to attract supportive constituencies. The principal\nconstraints to an efficient, citizen-oriented judicial system, each dealt with by the AJP, are\nsummarized in paras. 34-43.\n34. Weak Governance and Administration. There is no coordinating body for developing\nlegal and judicial policy, and no system for collecting empirical data to evaluate the performance\nof the system, improve accountability, or recommend reforms. For example, initial results under\nan ongoing study suggest that most disputes (civil and criminal) relate to land.19 This would\nsuggest a serious inquiry into the land titling and record management systems. Yet nothing has\nbeen done in this respect.\n35. Long Delays. Case management and delay constitute a chronic problem exacting major\ncosts to Pakistan's economy. Inflation creates incentives to delay because there is no statutory\nadjustment for inflation when a final settlement is reached. The causes of delay are many. Such\nas inadequate and/or incompetent judges, dilatory tactics by the bar, and nonobservance of the\ncivil procedure code.\n                  \n18 The eight law reform commissions were the: (i) Law Reform Commission of 1958, (ii) Law Reform Commission of\n(1967-1970), (iii)  \"High-Powered\" Law Reforms Committee of 1974 (otherwise known as the Hamood-ur-Rahman\nCommission), (iv) Law Reforms Committee for Recommending Measures for Speedy Disposal of Civil Litigation of\n1978, (v) Secretaries' Committee of 1979, (xi) Salahuddin Ahmed Committee of 1980, (xii) The Committee on the\nIslamization of Laws and Establishment of Qazi Courts of 1980, and (xiii) Commission on the Reform of Civil Law\nof 1993.  Other committees on penal law and the law related to women have published reports since 1993.\n19 Preliminary results of TA 3640-PAK: Supporting Access to Justice under the Local Government Plan, US$150,000,\napproved on 19  March 2001.", "10\n36. Lack of Professional Management. There are no professional managers in the courts\nto handle budgeting, personnel, technology, or case and court management. Record-keeping\nsystems are inadequate.\n37. Lack of Client Focus. The judicial system does not adequately meet the needs of the\npublic. For example, access to basic information about court procedures is lacking, and court\npublic facilities, especially for women, are inadequate.\n38. Lack of Budget Resources and Poor Incentive Systems. International standards\nindicate at least 15-20 percent of the judicial budget is necessary to cover essential nonsalary\ninputs.  Yet, at the civil court level, the nonsalary percentage of the budget ranges from a mere\n2 percent in Sindh to 4 percent in Balochistan, 7 percent in NWFP and 8 percent in Punjab.\nNonsalary inputs have declined as a percentage of the budget over the past 10 years to one of\nthe lowest in the world.20 Incentive and sanction systems for the subordinate judiciary are\narchaic and fail to promote efficiency and a citizen-oriented culture in which the judicial and\nnonjudicial staff can be held accountable.\n39. Inadequate Infrastructure. Court infrastructure is a serious impediment to the effective\nadministration of justice. The parlous state of subordinate court facilities conveys a negative\nimage of the judicial system, seriously undermining the status and dignity of judicial institutions,\nand is a severe disincentive to attracting capable legal professionals.\n40. Legal Empowerment. The lack of a tradition to disclose information relating to public\ninstitutions lies at the root of some of the fundamental barriers to accessing justice in the\ncountry. Even when policies are translated into law, the laws are published in English, thereby\ndisenfranchising the majority of the population (the basic literacy rate is about 45 percent in\nUrdu, the official language of the country). A large proportion of the population, especially\nwomen (women\u2019s literacy is only 33 percent) and the poor remain unaware of their legal rights.\n41. Grievance  Procedures.  The  lack  of  an  established  redress  system  for  citizen\u2019s\ncomplaints against public institutions has caused both the ombudsman's office and the courts to\nbe overburdened with petty, avoidable, and fruitless litigation.\n42. Gender Imbalance. Underrepresentation of women in the judicial system as judges and\nlawyers is particularly disturbing at a time when the number of women accessing the courts,\nespecially in family disputes, is increasing.21\n43. Human Resources in the Courts and the Legal Profession. The decline in both\nprofessional standards and in the quality of legal education has adversely effected the quality of\nthe judiciary. All eight major Law Commission reports since 1958 have strongly recommended\nstrengthening the quality of faculty, students, standards, curriculum, and facilities in law schools.\nHowever,  virtually  none  of  those  recommendations  were  implemented.  There  exists  no\ninstitution to promote dialogue about the role and responsibilities of the legal profession, nor to\nset, monitor, and enforce standards in legal education. The Federal Judicial Academy (FJA),\nwell equipped with excellent infrastructure and hostel facilities for trainees, was set up in 1988.\nHowever, FJA is not fully operational, as most of the positions lie vacant or are filled on an\nacting basis only, and it has inadequate budget.\n                  \n20 The Asia Foundation. 1999: TA 3015-PAK: Legal and Judicial Reform Project, ADB, Integrated Report, September\n1999, p. 65-66.\n21 The sociolegal study under TA 3015-PAK shows that an increasing number of women are parties to suits filed in\nthe courts. The difficulties of accessing of courts by women underline the need to improve the capacity of the\nformal court system to deliver justice. Without such improved capacity, women are effectively disempowered.", "11\n44. With respect to the police, the major constraints and issues are given in paras. 45-50.\n45. Politicization of the Police. The police has been politicized, and professionalism has\nsuffered. There is an urgent need for a reorganization of the police that insulates it from political\ninterference.\n46. Lack  of  Professional  Organization.  The  police  needs  to  be  reorganized  along\nprofessional lines. Currently the watch and ward,22 and the investigation functions of the police\nare handled by the same officers, with the result that the former takes precedence over the\nlatter. This partly contributes to the very low conviction rates in Pakistan.\n47. Lack  of  Modern  Technology.  The  technical  capacity  of  the  police  is  severely\nundermined by underinvestment in basic crime prevention and detection technologies, forensic\nlaboratories, and communications equipment.\n48. Poor Human Resources. Human resources below the officer level are particularly poor.\nThis is due partly to recruitment under political influence and partly to poor pre- and in-service\ntraining. Training pays inadequate attention to human rights and basic civil liberties guaranteed\nunder Pakistani law, while the current incentive and sanction system does not prevent violation\nof citizens\u2019 rights.\n49. Lack of Accountability. There is no effective remedy against police high-handedness,\ngiven the delay in the courts and the expense involved for the ordinary citizen. Complaint and\nincentive mechanisms do not promote police accountability.\n50. Poor Physical Infrastructure.  As in the case of the judiciary, physical infrastructure,\nespecially at the lower level, suffers from years of neglect. The inhuman conditions in many\npolice stations and the barracks for the constables are congruent with the treatment that they\nmete out.\nC.  Government Objectives and Strategy\n51. The Government\u2019s commitment to governance reforms is based on five fundamentals:\ndevolution of political power, decentralization of administrative authority, deconcentration of\nmanagement functions, diffusion of the power-authority nexus, and distribution of resources to\nthe district level. It aims to \u201censure that the genuine interests of the people are served and their\nrights  safeguarded\u201d  and  to  create  \u201can  enabling  environment  in  which  people  can  start\nparticipating in community welfare and be the masters of their own destiny.\u201d 23  To hold the local\nbureaucracy accountable, district ombudsmen will be appointed. Resolution of private disputes\nthrough means other than the courts will be encouraged through new institutions, Masalihat\nAnjuman  (MAs)  or  Conciliation  Committees  that  build  on  traditional  dispute  resolution\ninstitutions such as the panchayat. The powerful office of the district commissioner has been\nabolished so that there is no concentration of executive and judicial powers. Many of the powers\nexercised by these officers will now go to the judiciary and other line departments, while the\nexecutive magistracy will be placed under the judiciary. Separate criminal and civil courts will be\nestablished at the lowest level, and the capacity of the subordinate judiciary to deal with the\ncriminal work will be enhanced. These changes in the district police and administration have the\npotential to profoundly redefine and positively influence the relationship between the citizen and\nthe state.\n                  \n22 Watch and ward refers to the routine functions performed by the police to maintain law and order and prevent\ncrime, e.g. patrolling streets or controlling crowds.\n23 Local Government Plan 2000, Government of Pakistan, Chief Executive Secretariat, National Reconstruction\nBureau, 14 August 2000.", "12\n52. The  Government  also  recognizes  the  need  to  make  the  formal  court  system  more\nresponsive to the needs of the citizenry, particularly to reduce chronic delays in courts. Actions\nby the Chief Justices Committee and the Law Commission have drastically reduced delays\nrelating to family matters, and only cases filed in 2000 are now pending adjudication in the\nFamily Courts. Legislation on Small Causes Courts will be introduced to allow citizens to file\ncases at less expense using more informal procedures. Amendments to the Family Courts Act\nwill also expedite disposal of litigation. The Government is also committed to increasing the\nrepresentation of women in the judiciary, and for this purpose the Government of Punjab has\ndecided to induct 100 women judges over the next three years, particularly for family courts.\n53. The decision through the amended Police Act of 1861 to depoliticize the police and\nreorganize  it  along  professional  and  functional  bases  has  immense  potential  for  providing\ngreater security to the citizenry and particularly the poor. Public safety commissions (PSCs) will\nprovide for more democratic control over the police and its insulation from political interference.\nThe new Police Ordinance will redefine the administrative structure of the police and provide a\nstatutory base for the establishment of national, provincial, and district PSCs.\n54. To support improved citizen access to information affecting their rights and entitlements,\nthe Government is committed to the introduction of freedom of information legislation, which,\nuntil the present regional crisis, was intended to be enacted before the end of 2001. Consumer\nprotection legislation will be enacted and special tribunals introduced to enable citizens to hold\nthe Government and its officials liable for torts.24 Changes in the working of the ombudsman\nrules and legislation will also make these offices more independent and effective. To prevent\nenvironmental  damage  to  citizens\u2019  welfare,  the  Government  will  establish  environmental\ntribunals, as required under existing legislation, to adjudicate on violations of environmental\nlaws and standards.\n55. To support private sector development, the High Courts have decided to set up separate\nbenches to deal with commercial disputes, and the Government will introduce new legislation to\nbring Pakistani arbitration law up to international standards and to promote alternative dispute\nresolution (ADR). In this vein, the introduction of court-annexed ADR has the potential to reduce\ndelays in courts and to expedite dispute resolution.\nD.  External Assistance to the Sector\n56. The problem of governance in Pakistan has been well recognized by funding agencies.\nBut  there  has  been  a  remarkable  lack  of  coherent  and  coordinated  approaches.  Useful\ninterventions  are  now  under  way.  Human  rights  awareness  has  been  promoted  by  the\nNorwegian  Agency  for  International  Cooperation  and  Swedish  International  Development\nCooperation  Agency,  while  the  United  Kingdom  Department  for  International  Development\n(DFID) has supported assistance for police reform and has an ongoing project looking at issues\nrelating  to  domestic  violence.  The  United  Nations  Development  Programme  (UNDP)  has\nprovided assistance for local government reform and is actively supporting police-citizen liaison\nactivities such as the Karachi citizen-police liaison committee (CPLC). The World Bank, ADB,\nand UNDP have also initiated work on civil service reform but no significant follow on has yet\nemerged. ADB has recently approved small-scale TA to assist the Government to develop a\nstrategy  for  restructuring  government  at  the  Federal  and  provincial  levels  in  light  of  the\ndevolution plan.25 Moreover, the US government has been engaged in training of police officers\nin antiterrorist and antinarcotics work. Japanese experts have visited Pakistan to advise on\n                  \n24 Tort means a wrongful act (or omission) or breach of legal duty not founded on contract, that causes damage to a\nperson.\n25 TA 3744-PAK: Supporting Government Restructuring and Reform, for US$150,000, approved on 18 October 2001.", "13\npolice reforms, while many Pakistani officials have visited Japan to study the police system. The\nJapanese  government  has  indicated  further  support  for  police  reform,  and  a  mission  to\ndetermine the scope of such assistance will soon visit Pakistan. The Canadian International\nDevelopment  Agency  (CIDA)  has  recently  approved  Can$12  million  for  the  Democratic\nGovernance  Program,  which  will  strengthen  local  government  institutions;  promote  citizen\nparticipation, particularly of women; and foster more accessible, client-oriented and accountable\npublic sector practices, particularly in the delivery of social services and justice. A portion of this\nmay be used to support activities under the AJP. DFID has recently approved a project for\nSafety, Security and Accessible Justice, which will support a study and provincial seminars to\nidentify key problems and explore priorities for reform with particular reference to criminal law.\nWith its emphasis on criminal law, the project has the potential to complement ADB\u2019s work on\nthe legal and judicial sector, which has focused on civil and administrative justice. ADB and\nDFID are coordinating their activities.\nE.  ADB's Operations and Strategy in the Sector\n \n57. Improved  local  governance  and  access  to  justice  are  central  features  of  the  ADB\ngovernance  support  strategy.  ADB  sponsored  a  series  of  studies  under  two  TAs26  that\nrecommended a phased judicial reform agenda. An ongoing TA is pilot testing some of these\nreform proposals and is building the capacity for reform.27 In the context of the Government\u2019s\nLocal Government Plan, ADB is also assisting in the survey of existing legal needs at the local\ngovernment level and the capacity of various institutions in this respect.28 Work under these TA\nhas provided a solid foundation for ADB\u2019s assistance under the AJP.\n58. ADB  is  currently  supporting  comprehensive  efforts  to  design  systems  for  fiscal\ndecentralization. These systems include better linkage among annual and medium-term plans\nand budgets, local revenue mobilization, and intergovernmental fiscal transfer systems; and\ngreater  involvement  of  citizens  in  monitoring  the  performance  of  district  and  lower  local\ngovernments in service delivery. This work and ADB\u2019s assistance for restructuring of Federal\nand provincial governments is likely to lead to substantial loan assistance from ADB. Such an\nintervention would be complementary to reforms supported under the AJP.\n59. The AJP is the first phase of ADB's long-term assistance to Pakistan for access to\njustice reform. Legal, judicial and police reforms, like any institutional change, are inherently\ncomplex and require time to change institutional culture, incentives, and behavior. In this first\nphase, the AJP aims to integrate access to justice issues into the larger development debate in\nthe country, set the policy and legal framework for sustainable judicial and police reforms, and\ninitiate a set of activities to address some of the most pressing issues in the sector. The AJP\npurposefully takes a comprehensive approach in preference to a parochial supply-driven one.\nThis inherently translates into a more complex design and implementation arrangements. The\nexperience of other countries, however, shows that, while a comprehensive approach is not\nguaranteed  to  succeed,  piecemeal  efforts  are  likely  to  fail.29  While  comprehensive  in  its\napproach to judicial and police reforms, the AJP does not address many of the other related\ninstitutions  or  areas  (e.g.,  prisons,  penal  policy  or  a  thorough  overhauling  of  the  criminal\nprocedure code). Some bilateral agencies have indicated interest in pursuing some of these\n                  \n26 TA  2979-PAK: Strengthening Government Legal Services and the Subordinate Judiciary,  for  US$150,000,\napproved on 31 December 1997, and TA 3015-PAK: Legal and Judicial Reform Project, for US$995,000, approved\non 7 May 1998.\n27 TA 3433-PAK: Strengthening of Institutional Capacity for Judicial and Legal Reform, for US$2,900,000, approved\non 27 April 2000.\n28 TA 3640-PAK: Supporting Access to Justice under the Local Government Plan (US$150,000), approved on 19\nMarch 2001.\n29 Integrated Report by The Asia Foundation for TA 3015-PAK: Legal and Judicial Reform Project.", "14\nother areas. Progress on these will be monitored, and if need be may be supported under the\nTA Loan.\nF.  Programmatic Interventions: Lessons and Approaches\n1.  Importance of the Political and Economic Context\n60. Regardless  of  the  immediate,  short-term  outcome  of  the  present  regional  crisis,\ncontemporary political and economic circumstances will dramatically moderate the scope and\npotential  impact  of  the  reforms.  First,  given  the  fiscal  reality,  it  is  unavoidable  that  the\nGovernment may view program loan support as a quick disbursing form of budget support, and\nalso as an opportunity to cover the adjustment costs of fundamental governance reforms to\nwhich  it  is  equally  committed.  Second,  the  current  fiscal  crisis  will  circumscribe  the\nGovernment's scope to switch and increase spending on pro-poor reform investments. Third,\nthe  success  of  governance  reforms  is  much  affected  by  prior  social  circumstances.  It  is\napparent that patterns of adult literacy greatly affect the capacity of the poor to access the\nopportunities  created  by  reformed  public  institutions.  Fourth,  Pakistan's  geopolitical\ncircumstances have contributed to an unstable political system, with the army being in power for\nlonger than elected governments since independence.\n2.  Justice Reforms: Policy, Legality, Budget and Institutions\n61. The lessons from experience with conventional justice reform is it they must extend\nbeyond the judicial domain. However well designed and run, judicial systems are unlikely to be\nwell used by the poor. Access to justice in private life, economic livelihoods, and public goods\nand services is profoundly affected by the administration and police as well as the judiciary.\nSecond, programs in support of reforms can provide short-term incentives for policy reform, but\nthey cannot supplant or precede prior domestic political commitments. Third, reform programs\nmust  assist  governments  to  articulate  these  commitments  into  long-term  budgetary\narrangements that provide for independence of the judiciary and devolve spending powers to\nthe  appropriate  administrative  level  of  authority.  Fourth,  reform  programs  must  work  with\ngovernments, civil society, and the private sector to define, embed, and extend institutional\narrangements to articulate policies/laws and enabling resources.\n3.  Policy-Based Loan Instruments and Program Design\n62. The success rate of policy-based loans has been far short of expectations.30 Evaluations\nshow that in an environment of complexity and uncertainty, care should be taken against\nincluding too many conditionalities, excessive details, and inflexibility.31 Conditionalities are, in\nother words, best seen as working hypotheses to focus a domestic dialogue within government,\nand between government and a diverse range of civil society and private agencies.32 For this\nreason,  the  AJP  has,  from  ADB's  viewpoint,  adopted  a  unique  approach  to  tranche\nconditionalities  (paras.  111-113).  The  AJP  seeks  reform  outcomes  through  the  following\napproach. First, it will promote outcomes only where there is a prior policy commitment and will\nfocus on defining legal and regulatory arrangements whereby policies can be given durable\naffect.  Second,  where  this    has  been  secured,  the  AJP  will  support  the  establishment  of\ncorresponding institutional arrangements at the Federal, provincial, and local government levels.\n                  \n30 ADB 1996: Review of the Bank's Program Lending Policies; ADB 1999: Review of ADB's Program Lending\nPolicies, November; Collier, P. 2000: For a New Relationship Between Donors and Recipients: The End of\nConditionality?

Svensson 1998: What Explains the Success or\nFailure of Structural Adjustment Programs?, World Bank, Washington DC.\n31 Ibid., loc. cit., p. 23.\n32 Abonyi, G. 2001: \u201cToward a Political Economy Approach to Policy-Based Lending,\u201d EDRC, ADB, Manila.", "15\nThird, where these institutional establishments have yet to become fully functional, the AJP will\nassist in meeting the costs of adjustment, both fiscal and technical, whereby they may be\nadministratively extended (such as at local government levels) or fully articulated into a variety\nof arrangements for more citizen-government engagement in the administration adjudication\nand policing of the poor's entitlement to justice.\nV.  THE PROGRAM\nA.  Rationale\n63. The pro-poor rationale for the AJP centers on the concepts of vulnerability, access to\njustice, entitlements, and assets. Vulnerability is understood as a function of insecurity of access\nto key sets of material, social, political, and environmental assets, which expose individuals,\nhouseholds and communities to increased or disproportionate risk of impoverishment. Justice is\nunderstood as a function of the relationship between institutions responsible for delivering\nentitlements (public goods and services) predictably, affordably, and accountably and the ability\nof  the  poor  to  secure  and  sustain  their  access  to  key  sets  of  assets.  Efforts  to  limit  the\nvulnerability of the poor to the vagaries of systems of administrative, political, civil, and criminal\njustice are at least as important as macroeconomic performance in poverty reduction. Further\nthe  present  legal  framework  and  the  performance  of  the  judicial  institutions  responsible\nsignificantly constrain market-based economic growth and, in particular, hinder foreign direct\ninvestment as well as the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises.\n64. Reforms  in  the  administrative,  police  and  judicial  sectors  have  until  now  proven\nparticularly  difficult.  However,  the  present  context  for  the  AJP  is  conducive.  First,  the\nGovernment has already taken same very significant steps to demonstrate its commitment to all\nthe  policy,  legal  and  structural  reforms  listed  in  the  Policy  Matrix.  Second,  government\ncommitment to devolution and the creation of democratically elected local governments ensures\nthat the judicial and police reforms supported under the AJP are nested in a wider framework of\nprior Government commitment. Finally, government policy acknowledges that these reforms will\nrequire thorough-going changes in public sector budget planning and expenditure management,\nincluding  the  introduction  and  enforcement  of  systems  for  better  accountability  of  public\nservants and officials responsible for fiscal and human resource management.\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n65. The key development objective of the AJP will be to assist the Government in improving\naccess to justice so as to (i) provide security and ensure equal protection of the law  to its\ncitizens, in particular the poor; (ii) secure and sustain entitlements and thereby reduce the\npoor's vulnerability; (iii) strengthen the legitimacy of state institutions; and (iv) create conditions\nconducive  to  pro-poor  growth,  especially  by  fostering  investor  confidence.  The  AJP  will\ncontribute to this aim by supporting five interrelated governance objectives: (i) providing a legal\nbasis for judicial, policy, and administrative reforms; (ii) improving the efficiency, timeliness, and\neffectiveness of judicial33 and police services; (iii) supporting greater equity and accessibility in\njustice services for the vulnerable poor; (iv) improving predictability and consistency between\nfiscal  and  human  resource  allocation  and  the  mandates  of  reformed  judicial  and  police\ninstitutions at the Federal, provincial and local government levels; and (v) ensuring greater\ntransparency  and  accountability  in  the  performance  of  the  judiciary,  the  police,  and\nadministrative justice institutions.\n                  \n33 The  term  \u201cjudicial,\u201d  unless  the  context  indicates  otherwise,  includes  institutions  charged  with  delivery  of\nadministrative justice, such as the offices of the ombudsman at various levels.", "16\n66. The Program scope will include three performance outcome domains: (i) policy and legal\nprovisions, (ii) institutional performance, and (iii) budget/expenditure management. The key and\nsupporting objectives of the AJP are outlined in the Program Framework Agreement (Appendix\n2).\nC.  Policy Framework and Actions\n1.  Key Elements of the Policy Framework\n67. The  key  development  objective  focuses  on  two  areas- judicial  reforms  (including\nadministrative justice institutions) and aspects of police reforms- in the context of recent local\ngovernment reforms. Each of these areas is outlined below.\na.  Judicial Reforms\ni.  Improving  Policy  Making  for  a  More  Efficient  and  Citizen-\nOriented Judicial and Legal Sector That Promotes Access to\nJustice\n68. To support national policymaking for the administration of justice, the mandate of the\nLaw Commission will be expanded to include the administration of justice and its composition\nexpanded to include chief justices, as ex-officio members, and adequate representation of other\nstakeholders. Among other things, the Law Commission (LC) will focus on issues relating to the\nadministration of justice, such as (i) the working of the civil and criminal justice systems;  (ii)\npenal policy; (iii) initiatives, including research on existing laws and regulations, to reduce the\nvulnerability of the poor; (iv) from a public perspective, issues of finance and administration\nrelating to the justice system, to support adequate funding of justice institutions and their\nefficient working; and (v) a special purpose fund called the Access to Justice Development Fund\n(AJDF) (Appendix 3). The LC will be able to access the research and development fund of the\nAJDF. In addition, to promote regular review and coordination of judicial policy, a national\njudicial policymaking body will also be formed for policies within the exclusive sphere of the\ncourts. This body will be formed in consultation with the chief justices of the superior courts so\nthe principle of independence of the judiciary is fully respected.\nii.  Strengthening  Judicial  Independence  by  Complete\nSeparation of the Judiciary from the Executive and Ensuring\nThat Mandates of the Judiciary are Adequately Funded\n69. Although  judicial  independence  is  provided  for  in  the  Constitution,  successive\ngovernments have undermined this constitutional principle. The Government has reaffirmed its\ncommitment to uphold judicial independence. The recent abolition of the powerful office of the\ndistrict commissioner and the distribution of its powers to the judiciary is of historic importance\nas it is coupled with the decision to place all executive magistrates under the control of the\njudiciary. As a result, the judiciary alone will try crimes. To further affirm its commitment to\nseparation of the executive and the judiciary, the Government will review the functioning of\ntribunals and special courts, particularly with respect to the principles of judicial independence\nand public interest in free and fair trial of cases and equal protection of law.\n70. To ensure adequate funding for the judiciary over the life of the AJP, a medium-term\nbudget and expenditure framework will be developed to ensure that stability and predictability\nare provided with respect to judicial budgets and that budgets are more consistently planned\nagainst mandated responsibilities at different levels of the judiciary. The AJDF will include a", "17\nJudicial Development Fund (JDF), which will augment the subordinate courts, budget until the\ntime that adequate budget is provided (Appendix 3). The JDF will be used for developmental\nactivities,  maintenance  of  court  automation  systems,  and  provision  of  public  facilities  for\nlitigants.\n71. In the area of capital works, a national set of minimum standards for both buildings and\nequipment will be prepared within the confines of the budget and implemented countrywide.\nLegal measures will also be taken to shift responsibility, and the concomitant funding, for the\noperation  and  maintenance  of  judiciary  buildings  to  the  judiciary  itself  and  away  from  the\ncommunication and works departments.\niii.  Ensuring Efficient and Inexpensive Justice\n72. To reduce chronic delays in courts, judges, in cooperation with the bar, must begin to\napply the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code. Amendments will also be made to the Civil\nProcedure Code and the High Court rules. The delay reduction pilot projects under TA 3433-\nPAK will be closely monitored and replicated. Bench books and trial practice manuals to guide\nsubordinate judges will be developed based on experience under TA 3433-PAK. The AJP will\nalso support the Small Causes Courts and better functioning of family courts to keep such\ndisputes away from the normal civil and criminal courts. Pertinent to the reform of the civil\ncourts, the Arbitration Act of 1940 has been ineffective in providing litigants with the means for\nresolving claims outside of the courtroom. The law will be reviewed, and amendments made to\nmeet the original legislative intent by providing for wider ADR. Court-annexed ADR will also be\nimplemented in the civil courts, providing another option for judges to manage their particular\ncaseloads. Building on the work of the Law Commission in the drafting of the Family Courts\nOrdinance  of  2001,  amendments  to  the  Family  Courts  Act  will  be  enacted  to  speed  the\nresolution  of  family  cases.  The  local  level  MAs,  under  the  recently  promulgated  local\ngovernment laws, will also be established to build on the traditional ADR techniques indigenous\nto Pakistan.\n73. To provide quick relief against unlawful imprisonment, a study on the law of habeas\ncorpus will be initiated and recommendation implemented to increase access to justice in such\ncases. Currently only the high courts can grant relief against unlawful imprisonment by way of a\npetition  of  habeas  corpus.  High  courts  are  located  at  prominent  capitals  with  one  or  two\nbenches in other large cities. Combined with the costs involved, this makes it very difficult for\nordinary citizens to access the high court.\n74. The AJP will also support improvements in the delivery of administrative justice. The\ncurrent ombudsman system must be enhanced to provide for greater statutory independence for\nthe officeholder as well as the ability to conduct thorough investigations. A rule under the\nOmbudsman Order will be promulgated to reduce appellate delays and similar provisions such\nthat the office can be more effective in carrying out its statutory obligations. Statutory protection\nwill  be  enacted  for  officers  to  protect  them  in  the  course  of  their  investigations.  As  an\nadjudicator, the ombudsman will examine systemic problems through individual grievances and\nuse these to make recommendations for systemic improvement. The AJP will support the\nestablishment  of  district  ombudsman,  ensuring  resources  and  skills  for  both  their  dispute\nresolution and systemic reform responsibilities. The innovative work done by CPLC in Karachi to\nestablish a fully computerized information system will be examined.\n75. Finally, the feasibility of computerizing the justice system as a whole will be developed, a\npolicy announced for its implementation, and pilot systems instituted during the life of the AJP.\nThe linkage of courts to both the police force and the prison system through a comprehensive\ncomputerized system will serve as the main thrust of the policy.", "18\niv.  Legal Empowerment of the Poor and Vulnerable\n76. The vulnerability of the poor is significantly exacerbated by their weak literacy in law and\nthe inability to enforce the law. Courts at all levels will establish a citizen liaison policy. A\nfreedom of information (FOI) law will be passed, and the public will be informed of its meaning\nand uses. Publication of laws efficiently through the official gazette will be reviewed, and web\npublication of all laws will be achieved during the AJP period. A law will also be enacted to\nensure that all regulations and circulars having the effect of law will be published in the official\ngazette. The Ministry of Law (MOL) and the Department of Law (DOLs) will be assisted in the\ntimely  publication  of  the  official  gazettes,  including  publication  on  the  web.  In  addition,  to\nenhance the public\u2019s understanding of the law, simplified explanations of all new laws will be\npublished in Urdu. Over the AJP period, simplified Urdu explanations of major enacted laws\nsuch as the Civil and Criminal Procedure codes and the Penal Code will be published. The LC\nwill review legislation that is potentially harmful to the poor, women, and children, and actively\npromote its amendment or the introduction of new laws and ordinances.\n77. Protection of the underprivileged, and indeed of all of society, will be advanced through\nadditions to the regulation of both the private and public sectors. Strong consumer protection\nlaws will be enacted. Effect will be given to the constitutional provision that envisages special\ntribunals to hold civil servants liable for torts committed by them. To hold civil servants and the\ngovernment responsible for their negligent behavior, the protection given to them under existing\nlaws will be reexamined. The unequal definition of \u201cgood faith\u201d for citizens and civil servants will\nbe immediately reviewed to put civil servants and the public on an equal footing, and a judicial\nor quasijudicial forum will be designated to hold public servants accountable. The contempt of\ncourt and defamation laws will be reviewed, and new laws will be enacted to strike a balance\nbetween public interest and freedom of expression. Finally, an institutionalized and multipurpose\nlegal empowerment fund (LEF) will be created, as an integral component of the AJDF, with its\nown governance structure that reflects civil society representation (Appendix 3). The LEF will\nprovide new options for Pakistan\u2019s most vulnerable citizens and will allow for civil society\ninitiatives and public-private partnerships to empower the vulnerable poor. The feasibility of\nestablishing a public defender system will also be examined to provide legal support to the\nvulnerable poor.\nv.  Improving Judicial Governance\n78. To improve judicial governance, a system will be institutionalized for one or more judges\nin each high court (except Balochistan)34 to devote time, mainly for coordination of inspections,\nmonitoring performance, and investigation of complaints against subordinate courts. Such a\njudge, if not the chief justice, will be appointed by the chief justice and will be responsible to the\nchief justice for such functions. Further, the high courts will announce and institutionalize a\npolicy for the filing of complaints against members of the subordinate judiciary. This will ensure\nthe accountability of a citizen-oriented judiciary within a framework of judicial independence.\n79. To support increased transparency in the judiciary and case adjudication, annual judicial\nconferences will be held at both the provincial and district levels to promote dialogue among\njudges on problems faced by the courts and their possible solutions. Each high court will publish\nan annual report on the performance of the provincial judiciary. In addition, the Law Reports Act\nwill be amended to clarify and limit judicial discretion in the publication of judicial decisions such\nthat the public will be fully informed.\n                  \n34 Given the smaller number of the district courts and judges in the Balochistan High Court such allocation will not be\nfeasible or necessary.", "19\n80. Current administrative procedures will be reviewed together with the management and\ninformation systems to generate greater efficiencies through automation and computerization.\nBy the end of the AJP period, new management and information systems will be introduced in\nthe high courts and substantially in all district and session courts.\nvi.  Improving Human Resource Development\n81. To  improve  the  quality  of  its  staff  (judicial  and  nonjudicial),  each  high  court  will\n(i) develop a medium-term plan for human resource development; (ii) review the efficiency of the\nclerical  and  support  staff  of  individual  courts;  (iii)  define  a  medium-term  plan  for  staff\ndevelopment; (iv) introduce a policy of standardized, transparent, and merit-based recruitment;\nand  (v)  define  performance  standards  for  judges  and  link  these  to  promotion.  Terms  and\nconditions of service of subordinate judges will also be reviewed by the Federal and provincial\ngovernments To increase the representation of women in the legal and judicial profession, an\naffirmative opportunities program will be developed, including review of service rules, training,\nand public information campaigns.\n82. The skills and training of advocates is of great importance to the functioning of the legal\nsystem. To support existing law schools, a Fund for Innovation in Legal Education will be\nestablished under the AJDF (Appendix 3). The Government will also initiate a dialogue with the\nprivate sector and existing public sector institutions to establish centers of excellence in legal\neducation and for this purpose enter into arrangements for establishment of at least one center\nof excellence in legal education that is technically and financially sustainable and has a positive\nregard for social equity.\nb.  Police Reforms\ni.  Ensuring  an  Independent,  Accountable,  Transparent,  and\nProfessional Police Service Free of Political Interference\n83. Under the extensive police reforms proposed by the Government, the police will be\ndepoliticized. Provisions to prevent political interference in the conduct of the police department\nwill be made through the enactment of a new statute governing the police. Among other things,\nthe legislation will provide for setting up of (i) PSCs at the Federal, provincial, and district levels\nto  ensure  civilian  control  and  to  institutionalize  police  accountability;  (ii)  police  complaints\nauthorities; and (iii) district criminal justice coordination committees.\n84. Beginning  with  the  command  structure,  PSCs  will  hold  the  apex  position,  holding\noversight powers. PSCs at the Federal, provincial, and district levels will approve the police plan\nand  set  performance  standards,  and  hold  the  police  chief  concerned  accountable  for\nperformance and maladministration. The establishment and operationalization of PSCs will\npotentially ensure that political influence is eliminated. In addition, the current dual command\nstructure will be abolished. Functional reorganization of the police will also be supported to\nensure a more professional police force.\nii.  Establishing an Independent Prosecution Service\n85. An  independent  prosecution  service  will  be  institutionalized  under  the  provincial\ndepartments of law. Recruitment procedures will be based on merit and through an examination\nsystem. A law will be enacted such that prosecutorial misconduct will be a recognized offence,\nand citizens will have a venue to file complaints. Also, a policy of professionalization will be", "20\nannounced  whereby  appointments  are  based  on  merit  and  continuing  legal  education  is\nprovided.\niii.  Creating an Independent Police Complaints Authority\n86. Currently the police itself investigate complaints against police misconduct. This has\nlead to a lack of confidence in the complaint procedures with civil society representation. The\nauthority and mandate of the proposed complaint authority need to be further strengthened to\nensure that it will be effective. In the initial phase, the PSCs will act as the complaints authorities\nand, depending on the need for full time bodies, separate independent complaints authorities\nwill be established.\niv.  Fostering Better Police-Citizen Relations\n87. To  improve  low-key  police-citizen  relations,  a  policy  announcement  on  police\ncommitment  to  public  service  will  be  made,  backed  up  by  an  institutional  structure  and\nresources to make the announcement a reality. CPLCs and citizen community boards, as\nprovided for under the local government ordinances, will be established to monitor, among other\nthings, police performance.\nv.  Raising Gender and Human Rights Awareness\n88. Recent efforts to raise the awareness of police about human rights and gender issues\nwill be reinforced to become part of regular police and judicial training programs, together with\nchanges in the sanction and incentives system that promote respect for human and gender\nrights. In addition, formal statements will be made by the Ministry of the Interior committing itself\nto a policy of human rights protection, gender sensitization, and public service.\nD.  Social and Environmental Issues\n1.  Social Issues\n89. The AJP is a key part of nationwide efforts to positively influence the exercise of political,\nadministrative and judicial power so as to improve the accessibility of public entitlements for all\ncitizens, but in particular the poor, women and minorities. Although no adverse social impact is\nanticipated (Poverty Impact Assessment \u2013 Appendix 4), the AJP will actively prompt critical\npublic and professional debate about important social issues and will be one modest part of\nlarger efforts to transform the culture of governance in Pakistan.\n90. The concentration of political and economic power has led the state to promote parochial\ninterests, which has reduced its effectiveness at responding to the needs of a very diverse\npopulation. Corruption, nepotism, and personalized decisionmaking have dominated the political\nscene; and accountability processes have been both ineffectual and selective. Elites, acting\nthrough the executive, have contributed to the dramatic erosion of democratic process and\naccountability. The judiciary has too often been called upon to adjudicate essentially political\ndisputes. This has strained its independence and raised concerns regarding its politicization and\nlegitimacy.\n91. Although the AJP will act on a range of \u201csupply\u201d side constraints to the delivery of justice\nby  police  and  the  judiciary,  its  corresponding  focus  on  accountability,  sanctions  and\nperformance through legal empowerment will raise sensitive cultural, social, and political issues.\nAccording to this empowerment-oriented definition of access to justice, awareness and literacy\ninvolve building people\u2019s appreciation of their rights and the law; their ability to act on legal", "21\nknowledge or to assert their rights individually or collectively; and their capacity to mobilize for\nchange.  This  approach  will  focus  on  disadvantaged  populations  who  most  need  legal\nknowledge and ways to use it.\n2.  Gender and Development\n92. The AJP will aim to deal with critical gender disparities in access to justice. Women are\npresently disempowered by an array of prevailing inequalities that severely restrict their rights\nand  entitlements.  Laws  and  institutional  arrangements  that  reproduce  these  inequities  are\ndeeply  imbedded.  The  Constitution  guarantees  equality  and  nondiscrimination.  But\ndiscriminatory  laws  (which  courts  are  not  willing  or  are  unlikely  to  strike  down  as\nunconstitutional) exist and there is evidence of different forms of violence against women, denial\nof equal access and opportunities, and minimal participation in decision-making processes. The\nAJP has a distinctive approach to these issues. The prime focus of the program is institutional,\nrather than substantive law reform. Thus, the AJP will tackle gender issues through the creation\nof competent legal, judicial, and police institutions through which existing basic/constitutional\nrights can be implemented fairly and accountably. Through the LC as well as the Women's\nCommission, the AJP will promote research and debate on the quality and equality of existing\nlaws, and through this help build constituencies for change and consensus for reform. The\ninstitutional focus will articulate gender interests through the focus on the quality of services\ndelivered  by  government  and  judicial  institutions  and,  on  the  \u201cdemand\u201d  side,  on  the\nempowerment focus noted in para. 90. Concrete steps will include the revision of service rules\nfor judges to remove gender biases and to facilitate the induction of more women judges;\noffering  of  special  courses  for  potential  women  judges;  and  training  courses  in  gender\nsensitization  for  the  judiciary  and  police,  coupled  with  service  rules  that  promote  gender\nsensitization. Civil society groups engaged in legal empowerment activities will be eligible to tap\nfunding under the LEF. Thus through a combination of policy changes, capacity building, and\nsupport for civil society initiatives, the AJP will begin to address serious gender issues in the\nlegal system.\n3.  Environmental Issues\n93. The AJP will have no direct environmental effects. In the context of the AJP, however,\nthe weak enforcement of environmental legislation is of great concern. Presently the poor, who\nare most vulnerable to a worsening environment, cannot voice their concerns and as a result\ncontinue to suffer the consequences of environmental mismanagement. Effective enforcement\nof  legislation;  appropriate  guidelines,  regulations,  and  procedures  for  environmental\nmanagement;  organization  and  empowerment  of  civil  society  to  ensure  institutional\naccountability; and adequate resources are necessary to ensure appropriate environmental\nmanagement and prevent continued misery of the poor. Consistent with its institutional focus,\nthe  AJP  will  support  the  enforcement  of  environmental  laws  through  the  establishment  of\nenvironmental tribunals already provided for in the law, and by ensuring that any conflict of\ninterest is removed by different persons heading environmental protection agencies (EPAs) and\nthe provincial environment departments so that EPAs can effectively promote the public interest.\nIn addition, civil society groups will be able to access the LEF to raise awareness about and\nprovide assistance for enforcement of environmental rights.\nE.  Cost of Adjustment of the AJP\n94. To enable the Government to provide adequate security and justice to its citizens, it\nshould be able to fully fund the reasonable costs of providing these essential services. The\npolice reform proposals have already demonstrated the need for this, while ADB-supported TA\nfor the judicial sector has similarly highlighted the need for increased budgetary allocations to", "22\nthe judiciary, irrespective of efficiency gains expected to result from the judicial reforms. The\nGovernment accepts the need for this adjustment, and, despite severe fiscal constraints, it has\nalready taken significant steps in this direction by increasing the budget for the police by PRs2\nbillion  in  FY2002,  while  all  of  the  provincial  governments  have  already  introduced  judicial\nallowances for all members of the subordinate judiciary. In addition, a significant amount has\nalso been set aside in this year\u2019s budget to support local government reforms.\n95. Over the Program period, the total cost of adjustment is conservatively estimated at\nUS$406 million: about US$149 million for judicial reform,  US$237 million for police reform, and\nUS$25 million for the establishment of the AJDF. The bulk of the judicial reforms costs are for\nincreased  recurrent  budgetary  allocations  which  include  recruitment  of  new  judges  for\nsubordinate courts, rehabilitation of existing court facilities, operating costs of the subordinate\ncourts, and training. The police reform cost estimates reflect only what the Government has\nrecently committed to increase the recurrent and development budgets, and understate the\ncosts actually needed for police reform. This commitment to increased budgetary allocation for\nthe police during a period of very tight fiscal headroom strongly indicates the recognition that\nthis sector has been grossly underfunded in the past as well as the high level of Government\ncommitment to commence real reform of the police.\n96. At a time of severe fiscal constraints, it will not be easy for the Government or the\nprovincial governments to incur the large cost of these reforms. Consequently, the budgetary\nallocations to the judiciary and the police will suffer. To assist the Government to meet the cost\nof adjustment, fiscal support, through the proposed policy loan, will be essential. Regular and\ncareful monitoring of budgets for the police and the judiciary against targets set in advance will\nbe essential to ensure that loan proceeds are used in support of reforms under the AJP.\nVI.  THE PROPOSED POLICY LOANS\nA.  Amount of Loans and Sources of Funds\n97. Two policy loans totaling US$330 million equivalent, comprising \u00a529,685,000,00035 from\nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources  (OCR)  and  SDR67,914,000  from  ADB\u2019s  Special  Funds\nresources will be used to support the Government\u2019s reform program for the AJP. The Borrower\nwill be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The Government will use the counterpart funds for\nincreased recurrent expenditures on the judiciary and police, increased capital expenditures for\nthe  judicial  and  police  sectors,  and  establishment  of  the  AJF.  The  loan  size  has  been\ndetermined on the basis of the immediate financing requirements, costs of the AJP structural\nreforms, strategic significance of the AJP for improved governance, and the current financial\nposition of the Government. The cost of the AJP is estimated at US$406 million, excluding\nexpenditures on local government reform.\nB.  Interest, Maturity, and Utilization Period\n98. The OCR loan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years, an interest\nrate determined in accordance with ADB's London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR)-based lending\nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.75 percent per annum, a front-end fee of 1.0 percent (the fee\nwill be capitalized in the loan), conversions options, and such other terms and conditions as are\nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement. The SFR loan will have a term of 24 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years; the interest charge will be 1.0 percent per annum during the grace\n                  \n35 Equivalent to US$243.2 million at the exchange rate of \u00a5122.06 = US$1 as of 10 November 2001.", "23\nperiod and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. The loans will be utilized within a period of four\nyears from the date of effectiveness.\nC.  Implementation Arrangements\n99. Appendix 5 details the implementation arrangements. The MOL will be the Executing\nAgency with a program management unit (PMU) headed by a full-time director/joint secretary, a\ndeputy secretary, and support staff. At the Federal level, the implementing agencies will be (i)\nLaw Commission, (ii) the Federal ombudsman, (iii) FJA, and (iv) the Ministry of the Interior. The\nprovincial implementing agencies will be the DOLs, reporting to the provincial planning and\ndevelopment  (P&D)  boards/departments,  which  will  coordinate  AJP  activities  within  the\nprovince. The Law Department will be responsible for activities concerning the high courts, the\nindependent  prosecution  services,  and  the  ombudsmen.  The  Home  Department  will  be\nresponsible for activities concerning the police and PSCs.\n100. A National Program Review and Coordination Committee (NPRCC) will review and\ncoordinate  overall  progress,  and  corresponding  Provincial  Program  Review  Committees\n(PPRCs) will operate at the provincial level. The chairperson of NPRCC will be the secretary of\nMOL. NPRCC will comprise one representative of each of the provincial high courts, to be\nnominated by their respective chief justices; the secretaries of the ministries of Law, Finance,\nand the Interior; the director general/secretary of the National Public Safety Commission; the\nsecretaries of the provincial law departments; one representative nominated by the Pakistan Bar\nCouncil;  the  director  general  of  FJA:  one  representative  of  the  Law  Commission;  one\nrepresentative of the Federal ombudsman; and one representative of civil society nominated by\nthe Federal law minister. Each PPRC will be headed by the chairperson of the P&D or the\nadditional chief secretary (development) of the P&D. A PPRC will comprise the secretaries of\ndepartments of Law, Finance, and Home; the high court registrar; the provincial inspector\ngeneral of police; the secretary of the provincial PSC; two representatives of subordinate courts\nto be nominated by the chief justice of the high court concerned; and one representative of civil\nsociety appointed by the governor. NPRCC and the PPRCs will be assisted by the outputs of\nthe TA grant, which will focus on program monitoring and evaluation. Under the TA, civil society\nparticipation will be encouraged together with public surveys.\nD.  Procurement and Disbursements\n101. The proceeds of the policy loans will be utilized to finance the full foreign exchange costs\n(excluding  local  duties  and  taxes)  of  items  produced  in  and  procured  from  ADB  member\ncountries (other than ineligible items, as specified in the loan documents, and those specified\nitems and imports financed by other multilateral and bilateral sources). The utilization period of\nthe loan will be 36 months commencing in December 2001 until December 2004. The Borrower\nwill be required to submit with each withdrawal request a certification that the value of the\ncountry\u2019s  total  eligible  imports  is  equal  or  greater  than  the  amount  of  ADB\u2019s  projected\ndisbursements under the loan in a given period. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the\nproceeds of the loans and to verify the accuracy of the Borrower\u2019s certification.\n102. Withdrawals will be allowed against eligible imports for which expenditures were incurred\nwithin 180 days prior to loan effectiveness. Retroactive financing is justified to ensure the timely\nrelease of counterpart funds to the Government, which has already incurred a significant part of\nthe structural adjustment cost.\n103. All procurement under the policy loans will be undertaken through normal commercial\npractices  for  the  private  sector  or  the  Government\u2019s  prescribed  procurement  procedures\nacceptable to ADB, with due consideration given to economy and efficiency.", "24\nE.  Counterpart Funds\n104. Counterpart funds generated by the proceeds of the policy loans will accrue to the\nfederal budget and will be utilized to support increased budgetary allocations to specific sectors\naimed at achieving the objectives of the AJP. The Federal Government will on-lend up to 60\npercent of the counterpart funds to the provinces on the same terms and conditions as ADB\u2019s\nloans, except that the foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Federal Government. The\nFederal Government will use the counterpart funds to increase sector allocations to achieve the\nAJP objectives. In addition with setting up of new institutions such as the PSCs, an independent\nprosecution service, independent police complaint authorities, district ombudsmen, new courts,\nand improved forensic capacity, the provincial governments will take on additional recurrent\nexpenditures and incur initial set up costs. Many other components of the AJP will also require\nthe Government to increase expenditure on access to justice, for example, human resource\ndevelopment and operationalizing the FOI law. The counterpart funds will also be used to\ncapitalize the AJDF (US$24 million) and provide a lump sum amount of US$1 million for\nexpenditures. If the dialogue with the private sector and existing public sector institutions is\nsuccessful, part of the counterpart funds (at least US$2 million equivalent) may also be used to\nfund arrangements for establishing of centers of legal education.\nF.  Tranching and  Monitoring\n105. The  proposed  loans  will  be  released  in  four  tranches.  The  first  tranche  of\n\u00a57,714,192,000 (OCR)36 and SDR28,793,000 (ADF) will be released upon loan effectiveness,\nbased upon fulfillment of all first tranche conditions. An incentive tranche of \u00a53,051,500,000\n(OCR)37 and SDR19,561,000 (ADF) will be released by 30 June 2002, and a second tranche of\n\u00a59,154,500,000 (OCR)38 and SDR19,560,000 (ADF) and a third tranche of \u00a59,764,808,000\n(OCR)39 will be released by 30 June 2003 and 31 December 2004, respectively. The incentive,\nsecond and third tranches may be released earlier subject to fulfillment of the relevant tranche\nrelease conditions outlined in the policy matrix (Appendix 1, Attachment 1) and satisfactory\nconclusion of annual performance reviews, conducted just prior to the beginning of the new\nfiscal year (Appendix 1, Attachment 2).\n106. The  tranche  release  conditions  stipulated  in  the  policy  matrix  articulate  essential\ninstitutional and budgetary dimensions of the policy, legal, and structural bases of the reforms\nsupported under the AJP. Accomplishment of these essential conditions will not, however, be\nenough. A host of complementary actions will be required to create an enabling environment to\nboth establish and progressively evaluate the policy assumptions underpinning the reforms.\nThese  actions,  varying  from  capacity  building  and  legal  empowerment  activities  to\nexperimenting with delay reduction techniques, including ADR, will both facilitate and support\nthe momentum for reform. By engaging stakeholders (within state agencies and civil society) in\nthe reform process and demonstrating to the public that a positive difference can be made in the\ndelivery of justice through improved procedures, greater transparency, automation, etc., these\ncomplementary activities will instill confidence in the reform process.\n107. It is neither possible nor wise to chart a blueprint of such activities over the Program\nperiod,  as  no  amount  of  analysis  can  fully  anticipate  the  reform  process,  the  unintended\nconsequences of reform activities, and the interaction between AJP reforms and many others\nunder  way.  The  challenges  of  incentives,  institutions,  and  environment  often  require  that\nchoices be made among \u201cimperfect alternatives\u201d that account for local conditions. The AJP\n                  \n36 Equivalent to US$63.2 million.\n37 Equivalent to US$25.0 million.\n38 Equivalent to US$75.0 million.\n39 Equivalent to US$80.0 million.", "25\ndesign,  while  establishing  essential  principles  and  institutional  lynchpins,  must  also  allow\nsufficient  flexibility  for  experimentation  and  fine-tuning  of  institutional  arrangements  and\nincentives that are suited to local conditions.\n108. The performance review process (Appendix 1, Attachment 2) will build on and provide\nadded incentive for existing procedures for monitoring and compliance verification within the\nGovernment, which requires periodic progress reporting and annual audit procedures. The\nannual performance review process will assess (i) compliance with second (and subsequent)\ntranche conditions, (ii) progress towards compliance with subsequent tranche conditions, and\n(iii) progress on complementary activities agreed upon between the Government (including the\njudiciary and the police) and ADB. The review will occur each year through a participatory\nprocess beginning at the district level (Appendix 5, Figure 3) during May-June each year as\nmutually agreed between the Government and ADB, just prior to the new fiscal year, to enable\nFederal, provincial and district authorities, with input by civil society, to reflect the results, where\nappropriate, in their statutory planning and budgeting process. A satisfactory conclusion to the\nannual performance review process (i.e., not necessarily full compliance) on the complementary\nactivities will be a condition for release of the second and third tranches. An additional condition\nfor release of the second tranche will be agreement on complementary activities to be carried\nout prior to release of the third tranche as part of the performance review. Performance review\nmilestones will, therefore, provide an opportunity to review, modify, or add complementary\nactivities to support the AJP.\n109. Through the TA grant, ADB will help the PMU to establish monitoring procedures to\nmeet three purposes: (i) monitor the progress of the implementation of the reforms; (ii) ensure\nindependent audit procedures; and (iii) provide strategic information, based on lessons from\nexperience,  to  manage  the  reforms.  The  first  two  purposes  will,  among  other  things,  be\nachieved by reinforcing existing government procedures at the federal and provincial levels.\nGovernment capacity in respect of the third purpose is less developed. Monitoring will focus on\nthree aspects of the reform:\n(i)  Budgetary  Commitments  and  Expenditure  Performance.  ADB  will  seek\nassurance  that  the  Government  honor  its  commitment  (a)  to  progressively\nincrease budget allocations, (b) to ensure greater consistency between budgets\napproved  and  actual  transfers  through  expenditure,  and  (c)  that  nonsalary\nrecurrent  budgets  approved  at  the  provincial  level  for  the  judicial  sector\nallocations are at least 12 percent of the total expenditure.\n(ii)  Implementation of Institutional Arrangements. These should be provided for\nunder the court, local government, and police ordinances and amendments to\nexisting laws (e.g., ombudsman).\n(iii)  Performance of the Access to Justice Development Fund. This will include\nthe  subsidiary  Judicial  Development  Fund  (JDF),  Legal  Empowerment  Fund\n(LEF), and the Fund for Innovations in Legal Education (FILE); the research and\ndevelopment  fund;  and  the  FJA  Fund,  especially  with  respect  to  (a)  the\nconsistency between the objectives of the respective funds and actual practice,\n(b)  the  performance  of  the  respective  fund  governing  structures,  and\n(c) accounting and auditing of fund utilization. These reviews will assist Law\nCommission to reexamine the AJDF and its working, and to make modifications\nas necessary.\n110. MOL, in cooperation with the Implementing Agencies and TA grant and loan consultants,\nand ADB will conduct evaluations by an independent authority jointly appointed by ADB and the\nGovernment at the end of year 3 of AJP implementation. The Government will keep ADB", "26\ninformed of the outcome of policy discussions with other multilateral and bilateral aid agencies\nthat have implications for implementation of the AJP, and will provide ADB with an opportunity\nto comment on any resulting policy discussions.\n111. MOL (in coordination with the Implementing Agencies) will submit a program completion\nreport  to  ADB  three  months  after  the  loan  closing  date.  The  report  will  evaluate  the\nimplementation of the policy measures under the AJP, assess their impact, describe lessons\nlearned during implementation, and outline further actions required for improving access to\njustice. To supplement monitoring by the Pakistan Resident Mission, ADB will regularly field\nmissions to ensure smooth implementation under the policy and TA loans and to discuss\nprogress with MOL and the Implementing Agencies.\n112. The Government will be able to withdraw funds in three tranches from the loan account\nduring a three-year period starting from loan effectiveness. In addition, there will be an incentive\ntranche, which can be disbursed before the second tranche. The first tranche will become\navailable after loan effectiveness following up-front compliance with the conditions specified in\nthe Policy Matrix (Appendix 1, Attachment 1) and after loan effectiveness. The  incentive\ntranche  is  expected  to  be  released  by  30  June  2002,  on  compliance  with  the  following\nconditions and satisfactory progress with the TA loan:\n1. Judicial Reforms\n(a)  Introduce amendments to the Law Commission Ordinance of 1984 to improve\nthe administration of justice.\n(b)  Formalize a national judicial policymaking body acceptable to the chief justices.\n(c)  Establish the AJDF with an endowment of US$24 million to be paid in two\ntranches of US$12 million each during July in FY2003 and July FY2004. In\naddition, US$1 million will be released during July 2002 for the purposes of the\nAJDF, and until then nothing will be spent from the AJDF. Finalize the rules of\nthe AJDF by July 2002.\n(d)  Reach  agreement  among  the  provinces  and  high  courts  on  increments  of\nadditional budget allocations in real terms by province to the judiciary over a five-\nyear period.\n(e)  Enact and bring into force an ordinance to establish small causes courts.\n(f)  Enact amendments to the Family Courts Act to speed up resolution of all family\ndisputes.\n(g)  Based  on  recommendations  of  the  habeas  corpus  study,  enact  legislative\nchanges as necessary.\n(h)  Finalize and approve (by each high court) a program for delay reduction and\ncommence  implementation  during  FY2003.

Such judge or judges will be responsible to\nthe chief justice and will perform functions that will be subject to such instructions\nand orders that the chief justice of the high court may deem appropriate.41\n(p)  Amend  the  Law  Reports  Act  to  clarify  and  limit  judicial  discretion  in  the\npublication of judicial decisions.\n(q)  Finalize  (by  each  high  court)  a  time-bound  and  costed  action  plan  for\nprofessionalizing its management, to begin implementation in FY2003.\n(r)  Announce and approve a policy and program of affirmative opportunity to remove\nbarriers to entry and encourage women to enter the legal and judicial professions\nby revision of service rules, training, and public information campaigns.\n2. Police Reforms\n(a)  Enact and bring into force a new Police Ordinance that, among other things,\nprovides for (i) PSCs for insulating the police from political interference, and\nholding the police accountable to PSCs; (ii) an independent complaints authority\nagainst the police; and (iii) reorganization of police along functional lines with a\nseparate wing for inspection.\n(b)  Approve a costed and time-bound plan to enhance police performance, including\nforensic facilities, criminal investigation, police capacity, and training.\n                  \n40 This judge may be the chief justice, or a senior judge, and will predominantly perform the duties of administrative\njudge.\n41 The Federal and provincial governments (except Balochistan, to which this condition will not apply) will sanction the\nappointment of one additional high court judge.", "28\n(c)  Announce (by provincial governments) by 30 June 2002 a phased program to\nestablish independent prosecution services.\n(d) Establish and adequately resource the police complaints authorities.\n(e) Establish a legal framework for CPLCs.\n113.

THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER LOAN\n115. The reforms supported under the AJP will require a series of ongoing actions and\ninitiatives to articulate the legal and policy framework established so far by the Government into\ninstitutional and organizational arrangements, which must necessarily be updated and refined.\nIn addition, fundamental issues of capacity and human resource development will need to be\naddressed. Work will also be necessary to design a participatory process for further legal and\npolicy reforms based on lessons learned during the Program period.\nA.  Rationale and Objective\n116. To be effective, the AJP management arrangements must be attuned to two realities of\npolicy reforms: first, that policy decisions are necessarily taken with incomplete knowledge of", "30\nexisting circumstances and their interrelationships; and second, that policy interventions will\nhave unintended consequences. The TA Loan will allow initiatives to be designed and instituted\nto respond to new needs. A TA cluster loan is ideally suited to this requirement: it allows for a\nphased  approach  to  supporting  the  concomitant  institutional  and  organizational  changes\nnecessary for implementing the AJP reforms.\nB.  Scope\n117. The TA Loan will be organized around five themes necessary to articulate the policy and\nlegal framework for justice reforms that will have been created prior to commencement of the\nAJP. Appendix 6 provides details on the rationale, scope, and activities to be supported under\nthe TA Loan.  These themes, and examples of actions to be pursued in the first phase are as\nfollows:\n(i)  Governance structures, Systems, and Capacities to Articulate Policy/Laws. This\ntheme  will  include  five  sub-sets  of  activities:  (a)  setting  up  organizations\nmandated  under  new  laws,  (b) direct  institution  strengthening,  (c) defining\nprocedures,  (d)  enhancing  human  resources,  and  (e) installation  of\nfacilities/equipment.\n(ii)  Public Knowledge and Legal Empowerment. This will support (a) campaigns in\nsupport of public awareness (e.g., on provisions of the Consumer Law and FOI\nLaw, liability of public servants for torts, etc), and (b) awareness raising with civil\nsociety  organizations  (e.g.,  bar  associations)  of  opportunities  under  special\npurpose funds (e.g., the LEF).\n(iii)  Performance and Accountability. This will include (a) establishing the baseline\nand  institutional  arrangements  for  monitoring  changes  in  efficiency  and  the\neffectiveness of the performance of courts and police agencies, and (b) clarifying\nand ensuring that durable arrangements are made to ensure accountability (e.g.,\nsecuring  the  auditor  general's  sanction  for  audit  arrangements;  formats  and\nschedules for annual reporting, and publicity events).\n(iv)  Policy Impact and Innovations. This will include (a) defining arrangements to\nensure that the lessons of implementation of the reforms are incorporated into\nrevisions and refinements in policy and laws for justice reform, and (b) defining\nprocedures for allocation of resources to innovative approaches (e.g., for legal\neducation, public-private partnerships, etc.).\n(v)  Supporting Further Legal and Policy Reform.  This will include (a) drafting of new\ncontempt and defamation laws; (b) a legal and policy framework for a revised\ncomprehensive administrative grievance procedure and (c) legal policy reform\nwork in other areas identified during implementation.\n118. The  TA  Loan  will  be  implemented  in  phases.  The  scope  of  the  first  phase  (i.e.,\nDecember 2001 to June 2003) will be finalized during the inception mission for the AJP, and will\nend at about the same time as the expected date of the second tranche release. Not later than\nthe  penultimate  month  of  phase  1,  the  Government  and  ADB  will,  as  part  of  the  second\nperformance review of the AJP, also review progress in implementing the terms of reference for\nthe purpose of refining and developing terms of reference for phase 2, which will continue from\nmonth 19 to month 36 of the TA Loan. Thereafter, not later than the penultimate month of phase\n2, the parties will repeat this process based on the third performance review and develop the\nterms of reference for the third and final phase. The first and third performance reviews will also", "31\nreview progress in implementation of the TA Loan. The activities specified for the first phase in\nAppendix 6 will be commenced but not necessarily completed by the consultants during phase\n1.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n119. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are set out in Appendix 6. The total cost\nof the TA Loan is estimated to be US$25.5 million equivalent, comprising foreign exchange\ncosts of US$12.0 million and US$13.5 million equivalent in local currency. ADB will finance\nUS$8.0 million in foreign exchange costs and US$12.0 million equivalent in local currency. The\nBorrower will finance US$4.0 million in foreign exchange for equipment and US$1.5 million\nequivalent in local currency in the form of counterpart staff, offices, etc. A loan of US$20 million\nequivalent is proposed from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources with a term of 32 years, including a\ngrace period of 8 years, and an interest charge of 1.0 percent per annum during the grace\nperiod and 1.5 percent per annum thereafter. ADB is actively seeking cofinancing from a\nnumber of agencies who have expressed strong interests in the reforms under the AJP. This\nmay result in lowering the amount of the TA Loan.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n120. Detailed implementation arrangements are set out in Appendix 5. The Executing Agency\nwill be the MOL, acting through the PMU, and it will be supported by Federal and provincial\nimplementing agencies as set out in Appendix 5. As the TA Loan is an integral part of the AJP,\nits implementation is closely aligned with the Executing and Implementing Agencies for the\nProgram Loan. All procurement under the TA Loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines\non Procurement. The selection, engagement, and services of consultants will be in accordance\nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB\nfor the engagement of domestic consultants.\nVIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE GRANT\n121. To support the AJP and assist in its effective monitoring and evaluation, the Government\nhas requested TA for Supporting and Monitoring Progress under the AJP. Given the unique\nfeatures of the AJP, its successful launching and its monitoring and evaluation will provide\nvaluable insights for modification during the implementation and design of future initiatives. ADB\nwill finance US$900,000 on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA program  to support the PMU\nand  an  independent  monitoring  and  evaluation  system.  The  scope,  implementation\narrangements, outline terms of reference, cost estimates and financing plan are outlined in\nAppendix 7.\nIX.  PROGRAM BENEFITS AND RISKS\nA.  Benefits\n122. The AJP will deliver benefits in three domains. Actions in the first domain, policy and\nlegal provisions will secure (i) greater judicial independence, transparency, and accountability;\n(ii) better citizen-state relations; and (iii) more durable public institutions responsible for delivery\nof justice. Actions in the domain of institutional performance will result in (i) greater judicial\nindependence,  fostering  predictable,  timely  and  impartial  rule  of  law  conducive  to  investor\nconfidence; (ii) a dramatic decline in political interference in police services; (iii) enhanced\ninstitutional arrangements for holding public servants and officials accountable for violations of", "32\ncitizens rights and entitlements; and (iv) greater public engagement in planning and monitoring\nperformance  of  judicial  and  police  service  delivery.  Actions  in  the  third  domain,\nbudget/expenditure  management,  will  result  in  greater  consistency  between  allocations  of\nhuman and fiscal resources and institutional responsibilities for delivery of justice at the Federal,\nprovincial and local government levels.\n123. The AJP focuses on the most basic of \u201cpublic goods\u201d (law and order, and justice)\nessential for orderly life and sound economic development. It will contribute to the Government's\nefforts to transform the performance of the judiciary and the police such that the citizenry will no\nlonger regard these institutions as irrelevant, nor will they continue to be a significant factor in\nthe vulnerability of the poor. While the benefits of improved rule of law are indispensable to\nimproved  economic  performance,  the  AJP  will  decrease  the  vulnerability  of  the  poor  in\nsubstantial ways including (i) alleviating vulnerability arising from the everyday harassment,\nunderperformance,  exclusion,  and  denial  of  basic  rights  by  public  officials;  (ii)  easing  the\nvulnerability of informal sector activities to rent-seeking activities of officials responsible for\nlicensing and regulating people's access to economic and environmental assets; (iii) improving\nthe accountability of public officials, and improving the accessibility and affordability of public\ngoods and services, on which the poor rely disproportionately.\n124. On the demand side, AJP strategy is that, unless major efforts are made to conscientize\nand mobilize the poor, women, and other disadvantaged sections of the population, the reforms\nrisk political capture and disablement. The AJP will exploit opportunities for greater public\naccess that are already prefigured in government commitments. It will result in local language\npublication of key legislation; promote efforts to improve public awareness of the roles and\nresponsibilities  of  lower  level  judiciary,  police,  and  administration;  and  foster  more  active\ninvolvement  of  citizens  in  judging  the  performance  of  these  organs  and  special  purpose\nfacilities, such as afforded by the LEF, to facilitate public engagement in seeking greater access\nto justice.\nB.  Risks\n125. The  risks  facing  the  reform  process  are  formidable.  Despite  the  unprecedented\nopportunities presented by the Government's commitments to the reforms under the AJP, the\nhistorical legacy of numerous failed attempts to affect lasting changes in the judiciary, police,\nand administration cannot be ignored. Resistance, foot dragging, and noncompliance with the\nspirit and letter of the reform process are likely, unless the structure of incentives and sanctions\non public performance are introduced. Three factors present particular risks to the reform\nprocess, each of which is only marginally within the capacity of the AJP to mitigate: (i) the fiscal\ncrisis will make it extremely difficult for the Government to adequately and predictably resource\nthe reforms over the next decade; (ii) implementing government commitments to reform will\ndepend  on  corresponding  constituencies  being  created  among  provinces  and  local\ngovernments, and on facilitation of broad coalitions and alliances with civil society; and (iii) the\nwindow of opportunity for reforms, through to October 2002, is vulnerable to uncertainty, both\nwithin Pakistan and the region. While the AJP design, in particular the TA Loan, will assist in\nameliorating risks relating to (ii) above, the other risks are beyond the capacity of the AJP to\nmitigate. Furthermore, the heightened sense of instability and uncertainty created by present\nregional crisis will undoubtedly impact on the law, order, and security situation within Pakistan,\nwhich it is the purpose of this program to improve.", "33\nX.  ASSURANCES\n126. Other than the tranche release conditions stated earlier and the standard assurances,\nthe Government has given the following assurances, which will be incorporated in the legal\ndocuments:\n(i) For the Program Loans:\n(a)  The Government will ensure that the policies adopted and actions taken\nas described in the Policy Letter, including the Policy Matrix, prior to the\ndate of the Program Loan Agreement continue in effect for the duration of\nthe AJP period, and subsequently.\n(b)  The following will be conditions for loan effectiveness: that the PMU will\nhave been established and staffed to the satisfaction of ADB, and the\nfaculty of FJA augmented as agreed upon with ADB.\n(c)  The provincial governments will be entitled to borrow at least 60 percent\nof the counterpart funds from the Federal Government on the same terms\nand conditions as the ADB loans to the Federal Government, except that\nthe foreign exchange cost will be borne by the Federal Government, i.e.,\nthe Federal Government will not pass on the foreign exchange risk to the\nprovincial governments.\n(d)  The Government will promptly adopt the other policies and take the other\nactions specified in the Policy Letter, including the Policy Matrix, and\nensure that such policies and actions continue in effect during the AJP\nperiod and subsequently.\n(e) The Government will implement the TA loan and grant in a timely fashion.\n(ii) For the TA Loan:\n(a)  The following will be a condition for loan effectiveness: that the PMU will\nhave been established and staffed to the satisfaction of ADB.\n(b)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, NPRCC and each PPRC will\nhave been established and staffed to the satisfaction of ADB.\n(c)  Within three months of loan effectiveness, TA supervision committees will\nbe established and staffed in MOL and the Ministry of Interior to the\nsatisfaction of ADB.\n(d)  Within three months of loan effectiveness and upon completion of the\nreview of the scope of phase 1 of the TA Loan, satisfactory to ADB, the\nPMU will initiate the hiring of consultants.\n(e)  The Government will implement the TA Loan in consonance with AJP.\n(f)  No proceeds of the TA Loan will be withdrawn or used from the imprest\naccount (i) for expenditures other than phase 1 after June 2003 unless\nand until that year\u2019s AJP annual performance review has been completed\nand phase 2 of the TA Loan has been developed, or (ii) for expenditures", "34\nother than phase 1 or 2 after December 2004 unless and until that year\u2019s\nAJP annual performance review has been completed and phase 3 of the\nTA Loan has been developed, in each case to the satisfaction of ADB.\n127. In addition, the loan documents will include a covenant that ADB will have the right to\nsuspend the Program Loan in case there is inadequate progress in the implementation of the\nTA Loan or vice versa.\nXI.

TA Cluster Loan Terms of Reference for Consulting Services (Phase 1)", "36\nAppendix 1, page 1\nDEVELOPMENT POLICY LETTER\n[date]\nMr. Tadao Chino\nPresident\nAsian Development Bank\nManila, Philippines\nDear Mr. Chino,\nGood  governance  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Government  of  Pakistan\u2019s  Three-Year\nPoverty Reduction Program announced in February 2001. As part of its strategy to address\ngovernance issues in Pakistan, the Government has launched an anticorruption drive and\nstarted implementation of a devolution plan that will enhance accountability of public officials\nand establish more democratic and equitable society. Local government elections have been\nsuccessfully completed and local government structures are being established in accordance\nwith the Local Government Ordinance recently enacted by each province. With devolution,\ncitizens will have more democratic control over delivery of public services at the local level and\nthe new government structures will be more transparent and accountable to them.\nCentral to good governance in Pakistan is strengthening the rule of law and ensuring\naccess to justice, particularly by the vulnerable poor. The Government acknowledges that this\nrequires  a  number  of  concrete  steps  that  create  a  policy  and  legal  framework  for  an\nindependent and functional judiciary, a professional police force that serves the rule of law, and\na  system  of  administrative  justice  that  can  effectively  and  efficiently  deal  with  citizens\u2019\ngrievances. The Government also needs to work with civil society to empower people to enforce\ntheir legal rights and develop public-private partnerships for this purpose as well as to raise\nstandards of an independent legal profession. Persistent inadequate budgetary allocations for\nthe police and the judiciary have contributed to a weakening rule of law in Pakistan. Any serious\nreform effort must, therefore, ensure adequate budgetary allocations and make up for the years\nof neglect through greater attention to human resource development and investment in physical\ninfrastructure. Only a comprehensive reform package that seeks to address issues of legal and\npolicy framework, institutional capacity and incentives, and sustainable financing based on\nefficient use of resources can initiate a process to strengthen the rule of law in Pakistan. The\nGovernment has accordingly formulated a comprehensive Access to Justice Program (AJP)\nwith the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to carry out systemic judicial and\npolice reforms to strengthen the rule of law to the advantage of ordinary citizens, especially the\npoor. The following key issues and areas will be addressed under AJP through lynch-pin policy\nreforms as detailed in the policy matrix (Attachment 1). In addition, a number of milestones and\ncomplementary actions will be taken as outlined in the performance review (Attachment 2) to\nsupport the lynch-pin policy initiatives in the policy matrix. During each performance review,\nprogress  in  achieving  the  policy  initiatives  will  be  monitored,  and  the  milestones  and\ncomplementary actions will be carefully calibrated to respond to a dynamic reform process.\nThe Government affirms the constitutional provisions relating to the independence of the\njudiciary. Accordingly, the Government has taken a historical decision to fulfill the constitutional\nmandate of separating the judiciary from the executive by placing all executive magistrates\nunder the control and supervision of the judiciary. The Government also recognizes that in the\npast inadequate attention has been given to administration of justice and judicial policymaking.\nAccordingly,  the  mandate  of  the  Law  Commission  will  be  expanded  together  with  its\ncomposition to include the chief justices of the High Courts as ex-officio members. The reformed", "37\nAppendix 1, page 2\nLaw Commission will be provided adequate financial and human resources to carry out its\nmandate. In addition, a national judicial policymaking body will also be established that is\nacceptable to the Chief Justices of the superior courts. The Government is aware that judicial\nindependence has in the past been undermined by, among other things, inadequate budgetary\nallocations. Recurrent non-salary budgets for the judiciary have declined in almost all provinces\nwhile the physical infrastructure for the subordinate courts has deteriorated. Accordingly, the\nFederal and provincial governments are committed to augmenting budgetary allocations to\nmake  the  judiciary  an  effective  institution  and  to  ensuring  adequate  budgetary  allocations\nthrough the development of a medium-term budget/expenditure framework for the judiciary.\nSalary and terms and conditions of the subordinate judiciary will also be reviewed. To ensure a\nmodicum of financial stability in key institutions, the Government has decided to establish the\nAccess  to  Justice  Development  Fund  (AJDF)  that  will,  among  other  things,  support  the\nsubordinate courts, the Law Commission, and the Federal Judicial Academy. The Government\nalso affirms its commitment to filling all judicial posts in a timely manner within 120 days of any\nvacancy.\nThe slow pace of litigation in courts together with the high costs of litigation undermine\npublic confidence in the judicial system. Provision of justice in an expeditious manner and with\nas least cost as possible is, therefore, a primary concern of the Government. Accordingly, the\nGovernment  will  pass  legislation  to  establish  small  causes  courts  for  resolution  of  minor\ndisputes through summary procedure, together with amendments to the Family Courts Act to\nensure speedier resolution of all family disputes. The law relating to writs of habeas corpus in\ncases  of  unlawful  confinement  will  also  be  reviewed.  The  High  Courts  have  began\nexperimenting with delay reduction techniques based on a modern case management system to\nreduce the backlog of pending cases. Currently, many of the subordinate court judges handle\nboth civil and criminal cases. In order to facilitate improved case docket management, civil and\ncriminal cases will be separated and assigned to different courts so that individual judges with\nhandle either criminal or civil cases. Similarly, separate full-time benches will be established in\nthe Sindh and Lahore High Courts for commercial cases. In addition, court administration will be\nimproved through a phased program that will result in induction of professional managers and\nuse of modern management techniques in the court system to ensure efficient use of resources.\nImproved case and docket management cuts across the judiciary, prosecution services, and the\nprisons. A comprehensive information technology plan will be developed for this purpose and its\nimplementation will commence under the AJP.\nIn addition, the Government also recognizes the need to promote alternative dispute\nresolution (ADR). For this purpose, the recently enacted Local Government Ordinances provide\nfor establishment of Anjuman-e-Masalihat (conciliatory bodies). In addition, the High Courts will\nalso promote use of court-annexed ADR as part of their delay reduction strategies. In this\nrespect, the High Courts have agreed to review procedural rules to facilitate ADR. The legal\nframework for ADR will also be strengthened through a thorough review of the Arbitration Act to\nbring it in conformity with international standards. This will contribute to creating a favorable\nenvironment for both domestic and foreign direct investment.\nDelivery  of  justice,  however,  is  not  confined  to  the  courts.  Many  of  the  public\u2019s\ngrievances arise from maladministration by government officials. The Government is, therefore,\ncommitted  to  improving  the  functioning  of  the  federal  and  provincial  ombudsmen  while\nestablishing offices of district ombudsmen under the Local Government Ordinances. Working of\nthe ombudsmen offices will be reviewed and new appellate procedures introduced to reduce", "38\nAppendix 1, page 3\ndelay. The Government will also review existing legislation to ensure greater independence and\nsecurity of tenure for the ombudsmen.\nBeyond institutional change, the rule of law assumes an active citizenry aware of its\nrights  and  capable  of  enforcing  them.  The  Government  supports  a  series  of  initiatives  to\nimprove the status of the poor in particular, and the citizens in general as regards their dealings\nwith the state. Accordingly, the Government will introduce the freedom of information act to\nallow ready access by citizens to information that affects their rights while at the same time, it\nwill commence publishing simplified explanations of new federal and provincial laws in Urdu. To\nstrengthen  rule  of  law  and  protect  citizens  from  arbitrary  executive  actions,  the  immunity\nenjoyed by civil servants will be reviewed to make them liable for torts committed against\ncitizens  as  envisaged  under  Article  212(2)  of  the  Constitution.  In  addition,  a  law  will  be\npromulgated so that rules, regulations, and circulars having the effect of law only shall be\npublished in the official gazette. Contempt and defamation laws will also be reviewed to strike a\nbalance  between  freedom  of  expression,  and  sanctity  of  the  courts  and  the  rights  of  the\nindividual.  To  protect  citizens  as  consumers,  consumer  protection  legislation  in  place  for\nIslamabad will be implemented and country-wide legislation will also be introduced.\nA country such as Pakistan cannot sustain a state-financed legal aid system. Yet, the\nneeds of the poor for justice must be met. In the first instance, they must be made aware of their\nrights, and ways must be found to ensure that they enjoy equal protection of law as mandated\nby the Constitution. Beyond the policy initiatives outlined above to improve the state-citizen\ninterface, other steps must be taken to ensure that the poor in particular, and the citizens\ngenerally  are  legally  empowered.  This  requires  public-private  partnerships  and  active\ninvolvement of civil society. To promote such initiatives, a portion of the ADJF will support a\nvariety of civil society legal empowerment initiatives from legal literacy to advocacy and public\ninterest litigation. Under the AJP, citizen orientation of courts and other institutions will also be\npromoted. In courts, information centers will be established in partnership with civil society and\nthe bar. In addition, improved administration within the judicial system, greater transparency\nthrough  publication  of  annual  reports  by  the  High  Courts  and  holding  of  annual  judicial\nconferences will promote greater citizen focus. To further improve the legal position of the\nvulnerable poor, a study of laws adversely affecting the poor will be carried out to identify legal\nreform initiatives for the poor. This will include a study of the rights of the poor to natural\nresources and the environment. Environmental justice will be strengthened by establishment of\nenvironmental  tribunals  and  ensuring  that  separate  individuals  head  the  environmental\ndepartments and environmental protection agencies to eliminate any conflict of interest.\nA long-term challenge for access to justice relates to improving human resources within\nthe judiciary and the police. This requires a multi-faceted approach. To encourage law schools\nto raise their standards, the ADJF will support innovations in legal education by existing law\nschools. In addition, the Government will work with the private sector and existing public sector\ninstitutions to establish centers of excellence in legal education. More immediately, the training\nof judges is of paramount importance. For this purpose, the Federal Judicial Academy has been\nfurther strengthened through increase in faculty positions and allocation of greater resources\nthrough the AJDF. Improvement in human resources is, however, not simply a function of\ntraining. Therefore, the Government is committed to reviewing terms and conditions of service\nof subordinate judges while at the same time, working with the High Courts to institute improved\nincentive systems for the subordinate judiciary, including introduction of revised performance\nstandards and transparent recruitment procedures for the subordinate judiciary. The judiciary", "39\nAppendix 1, page 4\n will be able to better articulate its problems and needs through district, province and federal\nlevel annual judicial conferences.\nAs part of its commitment to improved governance, the Government has also initiated a\nprocess of comprehensive reform of the police. In the first stage, amendments have been\nintroduced to existing legislation to depoliticize the police force by establishing public safety\ncommissions at the federal, provincial and district levels, and their composition and selection\nprocedures will ensure adequate political neutrality to ensure rule of law. Various legal and\nadministrative measures have been taken and a plan is to be prepared to enhance institutional\nperformance  of  the  police,  including  forensic  facilities,  modernizing  and  improving  criminal\nrecords and investigation capacity, policing capacity and training. Under further legislation,\naccountability of the police will also be enhanced through independent police authorities and\nestablishment of independent prosecution agencies in each of the provinces. As in the case of\nthe judiciary, human resource development will be important, with particular focus on training\nand introduction of improved incentive systems that promote greater citizen orientation and\nrespect for human rights and gender sensitization.\nThe Government is acutely aware of marginalization of women regarding their legal\nentitlements. With respect to the judiciary and the police, the Government is committed to a\npolicy of promoting greater gender sensitization, while actively promoting recruitment of women\nwithin the judiciary through, among other things, revising service rules to remove gender biases\nand facilitating induction of more women judges. In addition, the AJDF will provide resources for\ncivil society groups to raise awareness among women about their legal entitlements and to\nassist women to enforce their rights. In addition, the Government will support activities to forge\nconsensus on laws and policies to improve the status of women.\nMr. President, the AJP is a first step on a long road to reforms that will strengthen the\nrule of law in Pakistan and make a qualitative difference to governance. The AJP comprises\nambitious and challenging reforms that have been developed with participation of the provincial\ngovernments and the judiciary. We look forward to ADB\u2019s support for the implementation of the\nAJP and continuing policy dialogue to assess support for future initiatives. I appreciate and\nvalue  ADB\u2019s  role  and  assistance  in  designing  and  forging  a  consensus  around  such  a\ncomprehensive reform package.\nYours sincerely,\nMinister of Finance", "POLICY MATRIX\nJudicial Reforms Tranches Tranches\nOutcome Areas Policy, Legal and Structural Basis 1 IT1 2 3 Institutional Performance 1 IT 2 3\n1.

An Access to Justice Development Fund (AJDF) will be created as an endowment fund,\ndrawing US$24 million equivalent from the AJP Program Loan counterpart funds for special\ndesignated purposes. In addition, US$1 million will be provided for immediate expenditures. The\nprecise governing arrangements, objects of financing, and rules of access and accountability\nwill be determined by the Government in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\nduring the first six months of 2002. The review for the incentive tranche release, scheduled for\nMay-June  2002,  will  consider  detailed  proposals  and  endorse  the  establishment  and\neffectiveness of the AJDF from 1 July 2002.\nA.  One Fund with Special Purpose Windows\n2.  The AJDF will have the following subfunds: (i) Judicial Development Fund (JDF), (ii)\nLegal Empowerment Fund (LEF), (iii) Fund for Innovations in Legal Education (FILE), (iv) Legal\nand Judicial Research Fund (LJRF), and (v) the Federal Judicial Academy (FJA) Fund. The\nAJDF will be located at the center, under the jurisdiction of the apex policy-making body, the\nLaw Commission. The Law Commission will be entitled to a minimum of 3 percent of AJDF\nincome to defray the costs of administering the AJDF.\nB.  The Governance Structure\n3.  The  AJDF  will  be  placed  as  an  endowment  fund  with  the  Law  Commission  as  its\ngoverning body.\n4.  The various technical working subcommittees of the Law Commission will be assigned\nresponsibility for reviewing and proposing modifications to the policies, objects of financing and\nrules of access for each of the funding windows. The Law Commission will issue an annual\nreport on the AJDF.\nC.  Sources for Fund Creation and Maintenance\n5.  The sources for capitalizing and supplementing the resources of the AJDF will include\nan initial endowment of US$24 million equivalent counterpart funds and any future donations\nand grants from any source as notified by the Government in consultation with the respective\ncourts.\n6.  Only the income earned from ADJF investments will be spent on eligible activities. Since\nin some years there may not be an adequate number of funding requests worthy of support, or\nthe total requirement of acceptable proposals may be larger than the annual allocation for such\nactivities, allocative ceilings will be determined on a triannual basis.\n7.  There will be a 3 percent ceiling for administering the AJDF. The share of the activities to\nbe financed through the LEF will be 15 percent of total AJDF income over a three-year period\nwith a cap of 20 percent. The corresponding allocations for the FILE will be 5 percent and 10\npercent, respectively. The allocation for the FJA Fund will be a maximum of 5 percent, and 5\npercent for the LJRF. The bulk, two thirds, of the income will be reserved for the JDF (Figure 1).", "61\nAppendix 3, page 2\nFigure 1: Access to Justice Development Fund Allocations\nAJDF\nUS$ 25 million\nLegal and Judicial\nCosts of Administering Research FJA Fund\nADJF (Ceiling 3%) (Ceiling 5%) (Ceiling 5%)\ns\nw\no\nd\nn\ni\nW\nLEF FILE\nJudicial Development Minimum 15% Minimum 5%\nFund (JDF)- 67% (2/3) Cap 20% Maximum 10%\nNotes:\n1.  Allocations will only be made from the proceeds of the income earned on the ADJFs investments.\n2.  Ceilings and caps are to be estimated on a triannual basis and approved by the governing body.\n3.  If no proposal worthy of support is approved, the amount unutilized will be capitalized/ploughed back into the\nADJF.\n8.  The  allocations  for  the  JDF  will  be  earmarked  exclusively  for  subordinate  courts,\nalthough the funds will flow through the provincial high courts. The distribution to the provincial\nand district JDFs from the central pool will be population based, employing the population\nshares agreed upon under the National Finance Commission or other suitable and mutually\nagreed upon arrangements.\n9.  Some programs (especially in connection with the LEF, FILE, and LJRF) are likely to be\nnational in character, and the applications/proposals of such nature will be scrutinized by one of\nthe sub-committees with the mandate for a particular area/subject/subsector.\n10.  Other than income from the instruments in which the AJDF will be invested, increments\nin the it will come from the imposition of fees for seeking unjustifiable adjournments of case\nhearings (new proposal). To quality for access to the JDF, individual courts will agree to opening\na special purpose collection account, into which the proceeds collected as \u201ccosts to the court\u201d\nwill be deposited, and enabling legislation will be enacted.", "62\nAppendix 3, page 3\nD.  Judicial Development Fund\n1.  Objective\n11.  Until such time that adequate funding is made for subordinate courts, the JDF will secure\nfunding for the subordinate courts to finance an approved list of expenditures.\n2.  Eligible Expenditures\n12.  Access to funds will be carefully controlled to avoid overlapping ambits and multiple\nwindows that can be accessed for financing similar nonsalary inputs and investments. Controls\nwill be built in to check potential abuse by the administrators through manipulation of the\nallocations from the ADJF for recurrent expenditures and investment programs. Financing from\nthe JDF will, therefore be restricted, for example, to the following activities/projects/expenditure\nheads plus the maintenance costs of such facilities:\n(i)  operation and maintenance of court automation (e.g., computers, photocopying\nfacilities, fax machines);\n(ii)  reliable storage space for records (cupboards, racks, etc.);\n(iii)  court-centric information kiosks (providing basic information to litigants on court\nfees, where to file cases, etc.);\n(iv)  provision  of  court-related  conveniences  to  the  litigants,  public  amenities  like\nbenches, water and air coolers; and\n(v)  paying travel, board, and lodging costs of members of the Fund\u2019s governing body\nnot based at the seat of the provincial high court; the maximum amount that can\nbe expended on this component from the total income of the AJDF for the year\nwill be 3 percent of total earnings.\n3.  Sharing Arrangements\n13.  The fund will be exclusively for subordinate courts. Allocations for the JDF will be shared\namong the districts on the basis of agreed upon criteria which may be a combination of the\npopulation of the district, case load, number of judges, adjournment fees, and collections, each\nbeing attached a different weight. To ensure transparency, the sharing will be formula driven\nand protected from the misapplication of discretionary powers.\n4.  Governance Structure\n14.  In  each  province,  JDF  will  be  administered  by  a  governing  board.  The  proposed\ncomposition of the governing board is the chief justice of the respective high court to be\nrepresented by the administrative judge, the registrar of the high court, one representative of the\nhigh court bar, one representative of one of the district bars, one representative of the provincial\nchamber of commerce (the last two members to be inducted for three years by rotation, with\nselection of districts on an alphabetical basis), one person nominated by the Government from a\nrespected nongovernment organization, and one respected female lawyer/jurist. Civil society\nrepresentation will be mandatory in the governing body at the provincial and district levels.", "63\nAppendix 3, page 4\n15.  This board will review and endorse guidelines developed at the national level for the JDF\non the purposes for which and the manner in which the JDF can be utilized.\n16.  The share of each district, once distributed, will be placed at the disposal of a committee\nat the district level comprising the district and session judge, the president of the district bar\nassociation,  the  respective  district  coordinating  officer  and  one  president  of  the  tehsil  bar\nassociation to be represented by rotation (again alphabetical). This committee will have legal\nstatus and will be empowered to deploy these funds at its discretion for the stated/prescribed\npurposes to different courts on the basis of need.\n17.  Quarterly reports/accounts will be submitted to the board/committee on the utilization of\nthe funds to become eligible for next year\u2019s share of the allocations.\nE.  Legal Empowerment Fund\n1.  Objective\n18.  The LEF will fund legal aid and public awareness efforts on matters of the rule of law\nand on civil society initiatives concerned with the protection of rights-based civil liberties. This\nbeing a public good, the State has to ensure that it gets served by leveraging social capital with\na small contribution from the State \u2013 a small portion of the total cost.\n2.  Eligible Expenditures\n19.  The categories of activities to be funded from this window may include:\n(i)  legal aid to indigent clients (advice and referral) affected by violations of their\nfundamental  rights  by  the  executive,  especially  on  matters  concerned  with\ncriminal justice; at least 50 percent of the available funds should be set aside for\nthis category;\n(ii)  legal aid for administrative redressal systems/institutional grievances; those who\ncannot defend themselves against police excesses need assistance to access an\nindependent complaints authority against such harassment;\n(iii)  representation- public interest litigation;\n(iv)  public awareness and legal literacy campaign, especially for women;\n(v)  awareness of environmental laws; and\n(vi)  law reform and advocacy.\n20.  In case of (i)-(iii), the proportion of funds related to such programs (as determined by the\nLaw Commission) will flow to the provincial high court for the relevant provincial level committee\n(see JDF) to identify associated activities and organizations that should be supported from the\nallocations for such purposes.", "64\nAppendix 3, page 5\nF.  Fund for Innovations in Legal Education\n1.  Objective\n21.  The FILE will strengthen the quality of legal education in law schools.\n2.  Eligible Expenditures\n22.  Funds may be expanded for innovations in the teaching of legal education and the\ndevelopment of curricula, including funding of pilot projects.\nG.  Federal Judicial Academy\n1.  Objective\n23.  The FJA Fund will be used to improve the efficiency of the courts by upgrading the skills\nof existing and fresh entrants to the judicial cadre through better preservice and in-service\ntraining programs organized by FJA whose capacity will be strengthened.\n2.  Eligible Expenditures\n24.  Eligible expenditures will be\n(i)  preservice and in-service training programs for the judiciary;\n(ii)  training and education for nonjudicial personnel, e.g., administrators, registrars,\nand other support staff, in policy development and implementation, case flow\nmanagement, budgets, planning, information systems, and records management;\n(iii)  development of training materials and aids.\nH.  Legal and Judicial Research Fund\n1.  Objective\n25. The LJRF will promote applied research on the legal and judicial system that can inform\npolicy making.\n2.  Eligible Expenditures\n26.  Expenditures may be for legal and judicial research aimed at improving the quality of\njudgment.\n27.  The Law Commission and other research bodies will be eligible to apply for these funds.", "65\nAppendix 4, page 1\nPOVERTY IMPACT ASSESSMENT\n1. The five broad outputs expected from the Access to Justice Program (AJP) are (i)\nimprovement of policy and legal frameworks to remove major constraints on public rights (such\nas access to information, redress, and public accountability), commerce and investment, judicial\nindependence, and depoliticization of the police, among others; and improved accountability\nand performance of public sector performance in delivering services; (ii) greater efficiency,\ntimeliness,  and  effectiveness  in  judiciary  and  policy  administration;  (iii)  greater  equity  and\naccessibility  of judicial and police services for the poor; (iv) improved allocation of fiscal and\nhuman resources required for judicial and police reforms; and (v) greater transparency and\naccountability in performance of the judiciary and police. Collectively these are analyzed in\nterms of their anticipated impacts on the labor market, prices of goods and services, public\nexpenditures, and access to public goods and services.\n2. Impact on Labor Market. On the macro level, the AJP\u2019s impact on the labor market is\nexpected  to  be  positive,  as  the  constraints  will  be  diminished  for  market-based  economic\ngrowth. In particular, increases are expected in foreign direct investment and the accelerated\ndevelopment of small- and medium-sized enterprises, which are engines of job creation. The\ndirect short-term impact of the AJP on the labor market, however,  will not be as significant.\nAlthough the AJP will provide some additional budgeted positions such as lower court judges\nand police officers, their numbers will be small in relation to the entire formal job market. In the\ninformal job market, an indirect impact will be the loss of income for existing rent seekers who\nare able to facilitate judicial and police services under the current system.\n3. Impact on Prices of Goods and Services. On the macro level, the AJP is expected to\nreduce the cost of all business enterprises- from the large corporations down to the streetside\nvendors- through more efficient access to judicial services along with a more service-prone, less\ncorrupt police. This increased business efficiency is expected to lower the domestic prices of\ngoods and services. In the short term, the AJP will act to increase service charges for legal fees\nthat redress the legal fee structures, which do not adequately cover the real costs of the\nservices. Because the hidden costs to the public will be replaced by higher legal fees the impact\non the overall price of these services will be minimal if not lessened. Surveys have revealed that\nthe public (both poor and well-to-do) are willing to pay higher legal fees if they fully cover the\nservice for which they are intended.\n4. Impact on Public Expenditures: A significant increase for the judiciary and police is\nexpected in both recurrent and development expenditures by both the Federal and provincial\ngovernments and is a key element to the success of the AJP. In addition to the increased\nbudgetary allocation for these sectors, the AJP is expected to contribute directly to the better\nmanagement of all public expenditure, which in turn will improve efficiency and quality in the\ndelivery of social services in general. This is significant, since the Government is the main\nprovider for the poor in Pakistan.\n5. Impact on Access to Public Goods and Services. The short-term impact on the\nimproved judiciary and police is not expected to be significant, since the reform process will\nrequire not only changes in the institutions and legal framework but, perhaps most importantly,\nchanges in the perceptions, expectations, and behavior of both the service providers and the\ngeneral public at large. However, that is not to say that immediate positive impacts in improved", "66\nAppendix 4, page 2\nservices are not expected through pilot projects to speed up delivery of justice and police\nservices at the neighborhood levels. For the poor, the most significant impact should be that\nbeing poor will not deprive them of a basic sense of security from abuse by those who have\nmore wealth or power, nor of the attainment of increased personal security from unjustified\nharassment from the judiciary and police.\nType of Effect\nChannel Direct Indirect Macro Impact on\n(short-term) (medium-term) Non-Poor\nLabor Minimal effect jobs Income losses for Improvement of Skilled and\nMarket in the judiciary and rent seekers business educated labor is\npolice through the facilitating confidence. expected to\ncreation of new services under benefit from\npositions. current system. increased foreign\ninvestment that\nEmployment creates\ngeneration in employment\nprivate sector as opportunities.\ninvestment\nincreases.\nPrices Service charges for Increased\nlegal fees are to be business\nincreased but efficiency of\nconsumers are formal\nwilling to pay for businesses is\nbetter service expected to lower\nespecially if hidden prices of\nchanges are domestic goods\nabolished. and services.\nPublic Despite budgetary Other sector may Overall fiscal\nExpenditures constraints receive relatively deficit targets\nincrease smaller agreed upon with\ngovernment budgetary IMF will be\nexpenditure for allocation given maintained.\njudiciary and police budgetary\nadministration. constraints.\nAccess to Due to the A significant Spillover effect to Impact relatively\nPublic Goods tremendous improvement in improved delivery less on non-poor\nand Services backlog of cases the timeliness of public foods who have access\nand entrenched and quality of across as the to justice and\npractices in the legal services is efficiency and police services\nlegal/justice system expected. effectiveness of through their\nthe significant judicial and police position of power\nimmediate effect is services or financial\nnot anticipated. permeate strength.\nthroughout the\npublic sector.", "67\nAppendix 5, page 1\nINSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR PROGRAM MANAGEMENT\nA.  Program Loan Agency Arrangements\n1.  The Ministry of Law, Justice, Human Rights and Parliamentary Affairs (MOL) will be the\nProgram Executing Agency with a program management unit (PMU) headed by a full-time\ndirector/joint  secretary,  a  deputy  director  and  support  staff.  At  the  Federal  level,  the\nimplementing agencies will be (i) the Law Commission, (ii) the Federal Ombudsman, (iii) the\nFederal Judicial Academy, and (iv) the Ministry of Interior. In each province, the provincial\nimplementing agencies will be the departments of law and home, reporting to the provincial\nplanning and development board/department, which will coordinate the program activities within\nthe province. The law department will be responsible for program activities concerning the high\ncourts, the independent prosecution services, and the ombudsmen. The home department will\nbe responsible for program activities concerning the police and public safety commissions\n(PSCs).\nB.  Technical Assistance Loan Agency Arrangements\n2.  The PMU within MOL, operating within the Acesss to Justice Program(AJP) annual plan\nand budget prepared by the program review committee, will be responsible for all procurement\nand contract management, including gaining contact clearances from ADB Headquarters. In\nboth MOL and the Ministry of Interior there will be on AJP cluster TA loan supervision committee\nresponsible for preparing terms of reference, sourcing domestic consultants, and requesting\nPMU support for necessary contracting and management. These committees will be responsible\nfor  monitoring  consultants;  certifying  their  progress  to  MOL  for  the  purpose  of  contract\npayments; and, on a quarterly and annual basis, preparing progress reports to the National\nProgram Review and Coordination Committee (NPRCC).\n3.  At the provincial level, the TA cluster loan activities will be the responsibility of the law\ndepartment and the home department, in the context of the AJP annual plan and budget. While\ncontract  management  will  remain  the  PMU  is  responsibility,  P&D  will  be  responsible  for\ncoordinating TA activities in the province, including monitoring progress. Prepayment iertification\nto MOL will be provided by the law department and home department, with P&D retaining a\nsupervisory role. This task will be supported by procurement and supervision committees in the\nhigh court law department and home department. (Figure 1).\nC.  Coordination Arrangements\n4.  Given the multi-agency nature of governance reforms, and the specific assignments of\nresponsibility under the AJP, NPRCC will review and coordinate progress at the provincial level.\nThe  chairperson  of  NPRCC  will  be  the  secretary  of  MOL.  NPRCC  will  comprise  one\nrepresentative of each of the provincial high courts, to be nominated by their respective chief\njustices;  the  secretaries  of  the  ministries  of  law,  finance,  and  interior;  the  director\ngeneral/secretary of the National Public Safety Commission; each of the secretaries of the\nprovincial law departments; one representative nominated by the Pakistan Bar Council; the\ndirector general of the Federal Judicial Academy; one representative of the Law Commission;\none  representative  of  the  Federal  ombudsman;  and  one  representative  of  civil  society\nnominated by the Federal Law Minister. Each provincial program review committee (PPRC) will\nbe headed by the chairperson of the provincial P&D board or the additional chief secretary", "68\nAppendix 5, page 2\n(development) of the provincial P&D department. The PPRC will comprise the secretaries of the\ndepartments of law, finance, and home; the high court registrar; the provincial inspector general\nof police; the secretary of the provincial PSC; two representatives of subordinate courts to be\nnominated by the chief justice of the high court concerned; and one representative of civil\nsociety appointed by the governor.

Annual Program Review and Planning Process\n6. The performance review schedule in Appendix 1, Attachment 2 (which refers to the May-\nJune  2003  performance  review)  outlines  three  aspects  of  the  reviews:  (i)  verification  of\ncompliance with second tranche conditions, (ii) progress towards compliance with third and\nfourth tranche conditions, and (iii) progress on complementary activities agreed upon between\nthe Government (including the judiciary and the police) and ADB. The review process will be\ncarried out each year through a participatory process beginning at the district level (Figure 3).\nThe process will occur during the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year, just prior to the\nnew fiscal year, to enable federal, provincial and district authorities to reflect the results, where\nappropriate, in their statutory planning and budgeting process. The aim of this process is to\nensure that judgments about progress, and future priorities, reflect the particular circumstances\nand interests of proviniale and lower level authorities, not just in the judiciary, police, and\nadministration, but with significant input from civil society actors as well The process provides\nfor systematic input by district level authorities and civil society, building to the provincial and\nthen to the Federal level. This process will provide an essential complement to judgements to\nbe made by province and federal governments in guiding and implementing the reform process.\n7. To ensure that the AJP supports rather than constrains this learning and policy review\nprocess, the annual performance review process will take into account the level of effort put in\nto  carry  out  such  activities,  the  difficulties  encountered,  the  progress  made,  and  the\nmodifications required to achieve the objectives of the complementary activities. Satisfactory\nconclusion to the annual performance review process (i.e., not necessarily full compliance) on\nthe complementary activities and agreement on a revised set of such activities for the next\nperformance  review  will  be  a  condition  for  release  of  the  second  and  third  tranches.\nPerformance review milestones for the second and third tranche will, therefore, provide an\nopportunity  to  review,  modify,  or  add  complementary  activities  to  support  the  AJP.\nFigure 3: Annual Program Review Process\nADB PInufbolircmitay taionnd\nCIDA AGido vFeorrnuamn coen Natioanndal  CPoroogrdrainma tRinegview\nReforms Committee\nUNDP\nOther Bilateral and\nMultilateral Agencies Annual Performance\nReviews and Plans\nProvincial Level Review Process\nProvincial Program\nReview  Committee\nProvincial\nAnnual Civil Society\nHigh Courts Conference FRoreufmorsm osn CoSmurmveuynsity\nPublic\nSafety\nCommission Ombudsman\nDistrict Level Review Process\nCourts DFRoisreturfimocrtsm   LosGn CFiovirlu Smosc ioenty CoSmurmveuynsity\nReforms\nPSC\nOmbudsman CCBs\nCIDA = Canadian International Development Agency, UNDP = United Nation Development Programme", "71\nAppendix 5, page 5\nF.
