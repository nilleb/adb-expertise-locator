INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The long-term strategic framework of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Strategy 2030, \nprioritizes strengthening governance as one of the seven operational priorities committing ADB \nto promoting private sector development, good governance, gender equity, knowledge solutions, \nand partnerships.1 The Midterm Review of Strategy 2020 noted that weak governance and the \n0F\nlack of transparency impede the effective delivery of basic services. Governance deficiencies can \nbe addressed by a multipronged approach which includes the participation of the private sector \nin the development process and in delivering services.2 To assist with this endeavor, ADB\u2019s Private \n1F\nSector Operations Department (PSOD) is proposing to conduct corporate governance assessments \nto strengthen the corporate governance structures and capacity in selected ADB early and midstage \ndirect equity investments and corporate finance transactions where governance challenges have \nbeen identified.3 This activity is in accordance with ADB\u2019s Operational Plan for Private Sector \nOperations, 2019\u20132024. \n \n2.  ADB is one of over 30 development finance institutions that, in 2011, committed to the \nCorporate Governance Development Framework.4 This commitment included integrating corporate \ngovernance  in  investment  operations,  ensuring  internal  responsibility,  providing  or  procuring \ncorporate  governance  training,  collaborating  with  other  signatories,  and  reporting  on \nimplementation of the framework.  \n \n \n3. Corporate governance refers to the structures and processes for direction and control of \ncompanies and relationships among the management, board of directors or supervisory board, \ncontrolling  shareholders,  minority  shareholders,  and  other  stakeholders.  Good  corporate \ngovernance  makes  companies  stronger,  more  efficient,  and  accountable;  supports  the \nimplementation  of  good  environmental  and  social  practices;  and  contributes  to  sustainable \neconomic development by enhancing the performance of companies and increasing their access \nto outside capital.5 In emerging markets, good corporate governance can make companies more \nresilient to financial crisis, lower the cost of capital and transaction costs, provide employment, \nboost economic growth, and encourage new investment.6 \n4F\n \n4.  Early and midstage companies face a unique set of risks which they must surmount in \norder to succeed. Challenges may include inexperienced management, undercapitalization, rapid \nchange, large consequences and small margins of error for decision-making, low levels of \ndiversity (particularly among decision-makers), and overconfidence. This can prevent early and \nmidstage companies from achieving optimal growth. Boards of these companies are often not \nwell-equipped to assist on governance matters and may lack the independence to provide \ndetached oversight and guidance.7  \n5F\n \n5.  Under this technical assistance (TA), PSOD will select early and midstage direct equity \ninvestments  and  corporate  finance  transactions  where  governance  challenges  have  been \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

Based on the governance \nassessments, and with the agreement of the participating companies, ADB will develop action \nplans  to  strengthen  corporate  governance  among  willing  participants.  For  companies  and \nenterprises willing to pursue the identified improvements, ADB will provide the necessary human \nresources to assist them through this TA project.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n6.  Companies  which  have  diverse  senior  management  expertise  often  outperform \ncompanies which do not. Good governance is correlated with strong organizational performance, \nand research shows that, for example, a gender-balanced workforce positively supports corporate \nperformance in relation to company profitability, risk reduction, or share price. Companies with \ndiverse boards receive higher scores on environmental, social, and governance performance; \nmanage  risk  better;  and  have  a  more  comprehensive  understanding  of  key  company \nstakeholders.9 Moody\u2019s recently reported that companies with greater gender diversity tend to \nhave higher credit ratings, noting that this is a correlation rather than a cause.10 Women are under-\nrepresented on corporate boards globally, and this is no different in Asia and the Pacific, where \nonly one in five people in leadership positions are women. Even in developed economies, few \nwomen hold senior positions.11 ADB will seek to strengthen corporate diversity through this TA. \nAreas for improvement could include ensuring diverse, inclusive management; strengthening \ncompany policies to promote inclusivity; considering comparative compensation and benefits; or \nconsidering  revisions  to  human  resource  management  practices.  PSOD  management  will \napprove potential participants in accordance with its strategy.12 \n \n7.  On occasion, ADB nominates nonexecutive directors to the boards of directors of its equity \ninvestee companies. These nominee directors are intended to add value to the board of directors \nand the client in areas where skills or experience gaps have been identified. Nominee directors \nprovide  supplemental  skills  or  perspectives that  facilitate  the  growth and  prosperity  of the \ncompany, assist the board to discharge its functions more effectively, and establish or improve \ngood governance practices. As part of this TA, ADB will arrange for annual training and capacity \nbuilding for its nominee directors in areas such as directors\u2019 fiduciary duties. ADB will also take \nthe opportunity provided by these fora to promote its interest in maximizing potential gender and \ndiversity initiatives in its investments and to encourage nominee directors to identify areas where \nthese can be improved in the companies they serve. \n \n \n \n \n8   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 September 2019. \n9   C.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impacts and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: strengthened corporate governance in private \nsector companies in Asia and the Pacific.13 There will also be individual project alignment with the \nSustainable Development Goals according to their relevant sectors. The TA will have the following \noutcome: improved, more diverse corporate governance in private sector investments.14  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n \n9. ADB  will  adopt the  corporate  governance  methodology  of the International  Finance \nCorporation (IFC),  which  served  as  the  basis for the  Corporate Governance  Development \nFramework adopted by ADB in September 2011 and other development finance institutions \n(footnote 4). The methodology was revised in 2018 to integrate environmental and social issues \nand reviews companies\u2019 (i) commitment  to  environmental, social, and  corporate governance; \n(ii) structure and  functioning of the board of directors; (iii) control environment and processes; \n(iv) disclosure and transparency; (v) treatment of minority shareholders; and (vi) governance of \nstakeholder engagement.15 The framework will be modified to incorporate gender and diversity \nas an additional consideration.   \n \n \n10. The methodology considers the maturity and complexity of companies and classifies them \ninto four levels. At the first level are new or young companies with basic corporate governance \nframeworks,  or  those  without  an  environmental,  social,  and  governance  agenda.  Level  2 \ncompanies have intermediate corporate governance practices in place incorporating basic steps \nto strengthen the environmental, social, and governance agenda. Level 3 companies demonstrate \ngood international practices, including incorporating intermediate and other corporate governance \npractices that reflect the organization\u2019s commitment to improvement. Level 4 companies are \nleaders in corporate governance, reflecting applied best practices. ADB will target companies \nassessed to be operating at levels 1\u20132 for action plans and further development. Level 3 \ncompanies may also be considered for strategic improvements in areas identified to be weak. \n \n \n11. PSOD will engage corporate governance specialists with relevant industry and market \nexperience to conduct inclusive corporate governance assessments and assist with implementing \ninclusive corporate governance action plans and capacity building. Tools are freely available to \nassist companies in undertaking the reviews themselves, or, as is proposed in this TA, with the \nassistance of experienced consultants who can serve as a resource in helping companies with \nboth the assessment as well as the implementation and capacity building of good corporate \ngovernance action plans. Separately, annual nominee director trainings will be organized by ADB. \nThis will strengthen the capacity of its nominees within companies in which ADB has invested or \nprovided debt financing to ensure that their knowledge of areas such as directors\u2019 fiduciary duties \nremains current and reflective of international best practices. It will also ensure these nominees \nmaintain  their  awareness  of  issues  relevant  to  ADB\u2019s  development  agenda,  including \nenvironmental, social, gender, and diversity objectives.   \n \n \n13  ADB. 2001. Private Sector Operations Strategic Directions and Review. Manila. \n14  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n15   International Finance Corporation. IFC Corporate Governance Methodology. \n \n ", "4 \n   \n12. Output  1: Corporate  governance  assessments  conducted  and  action  plans \ndeveloped for up to 10 companies. ADB will engage consultants who have experience in \ncorporate  governance  assessment  as  well  as  in  developing  and  implementing  corporate \ngovernance action plans related to the business sector of the projects.16 \n \n13.  Output 2: Corporate governance action plans are developed for six companies, five \nof which agree to pursue them. It is estimated that most of the participating companies will \nexpress interest in considering an action plan to strengthen corporate governance.17 Having \nreviewed the developed action plans, it is anticipated that five of the companies will request \nassistance to implement the plans and undertake capacity building initiatives. Thirty consultant \ndays plus travel costs have been budgeted to assist the companies in pursuing the action plans. \n \n14.  Output 3: At least three companies improve gender and diversity frameworks. As \npart of the corporate governance assessment, opportunities to strengthen gender and diversity in \nparticipants\u2019 management and operations will be identified for all participants. \n \n15.  Output 4: At least four annual nominee director training and capacity building \nevents are held. Under this TA, PSOD and ADB\u2019s Office of the General Counsel will conduct \nannual training and capacity building events at ADB headquarters for nominee directors. Flights, \naccommodation, and daily allowance for 18 nominee directors have been budgeted.  \n \n16.  Output 5: Evaluation and lessons learned.  At the end of the TA, an evaluation specialist \nwith experience working with corporate governance in private sector companies will be engaged \nto measure the impacts of the TA and to document lessons learned.   \n \n17.   Additional activities and funding may be added to this TA to extend its scope to more than \nfive companies. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n18.   The TA is estimated to cost $1.0 million, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund ($750,000 TASF-6 and $250,000 TASF-other sources). The \nkey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n19.  ADB will administer the TA. It will be implemented by PSOD\u2019s Private Sector Transaction \nSupport Division, which will lead the TA and will select, administer, and evaluate consultants and \ncoordinate with PSOD\u2019s investment officers about the outputs of the TA and further actions. \nPSOD\u2019s  Portfolio  Management  Division,  which  ultimately  oversees  administration  of  the \ninvestments after disbursement and whose director represents PSOD in ADB\u2019s Governance \nThematic Group, will help identify potential clients and will participate in discussions about the \nresults of the governance assessments, action plans, and subsequent implementation and \ncapacity building work to strengthen corporate governance. ADB\u2019s Office of the General Counsel \nwill serve in an advisory capacity. The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \n \n16 The number of consultant days required is an estimate. The actual time frame of engagement will be determined on \na case-by-case basis as participating companies are identified. It is estimated that each assessment will take 10 \ndays on average. \n17 Should more companies express interest, PSOD will seek to accommodate their interest. Thirty consultant days plus \ntravel costs have been budgeted to assist the companies in pursuing the action plans. \n ", "5 \nImplementation Arrangements \n \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  October 2019\u2013June 2023 \nperiod for the TA  \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  PSOD\u2019s Private Sector Transaction Support Division will play a principal \nrole in administering and supervising the TA, including implementation \noversight, accountability for the outputs, and communication with \nconsultants and stakeholders. \nPSOD\u2019s Portfolio Management Division will help identify potential clients \nand will participate in discussions about the results of the governance \nassessment, action plans, and subsequent work. \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual selection  TA coordinator (national)  $80,000 \nIndividual selection  Gender and diversity expert  $84,000 \n  (international) \nIndividual selection  Corporate governance assessment  $420,000 \n  specialists (5 international experts) \n  Individual selection  Evaluation specialist (international)  $84,000 \n  Single source selection  Resource persons  $80,000 \nAdvance contracting   No   \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, PSOD = Private Sector Operations Department, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n20.
