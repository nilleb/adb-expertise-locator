I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed loan, \nand (ii) proposed administration of a grant to be provided by the Government of Australia, both to \nPapua New Guinea (PNG) for the Microfinance Expansion Project.1  \n2.  The project will support the further development of the microfinance sector in PNG through \nsix outputs. Outputs 1, 2, and 3 will strengthen the capacity of the microfinance industry to provide \nfinancial services to a broader cross-section of the community and strengthen the capacity of its \nclients and potential clients to utilize these services. Output 4 will provide appropriate regulation \nfor, and supervision of, microfinance institutions (MFIs) and savings and loan societies (SLSs) \nthrough the Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG). Output 5 will increase lending to micro and small \nenterprises (MSEs) to increase rural income generation. Output 6 will provide efficient and effective \nproject management services. As a result, institutions selected as participating financial institutions \n(PFIs), which will be identified through a series of institutional assessments, will be better able to \nprovide profitable, appropriate, reliable, and safe financial services to financially literate clients and \ncapable businesses, with a view to reducing poverty. \nII.  THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n3.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  estimates  that  only  approximately  15%  of  the \npopulation in PNG has access to formal or informal banking facilities, and that this is lower in rural \nareas.  Lack  of  access  to  financial  services  is  an  impediment  to  the  monetization  of  rural \neconomies, a constraint on the growth of MSEs, and a restraint on the mobilization of domestic \ncapital. The project will extend and build on the experiences and lessons learned from ADB\u2019s \nMicrofinance and Employment Project, which built a solid base for microfinance and developed \nmicrofinance as a suitable tool for rural development in PNG.2 \n4.  Microfinance services in PNG are being supplied through 20 SLSs, 2 licensed microbanks, \nthe  National  Development  Bank,  and  around  70  small  community-based  nongovernment \norganizations. The microbanks,  6 SLSs, and 13 nongovernment organizations have indicated \ninterest in project participation. Currently, these institutions have 43,000 microcredit borrowers and \n250,000  deposit  accounts.  Asset  growth  in  the  licensed  microbanks  has  exceeded  20%  per \nannum, whereas recently there has been more moderate growth in other institutions. Overall, ADB \nestimates that the demand for microfinance services is more than twice the current supply. The \nproject will improve supply and efficiency of use of financial services, especially in areas outside \nPort Moresby and major provincial capitals. \n5.  Despite earlier successes, the microfinance sector in PNG continues to face a number of \ndevelopment issues, including (i) lack of access to financial services, particularly in rural areas; (ii) \npoor financial literacy and business management skills; (iii) low capacity among microfinance and \nsocioeconomic  institutions;  (iv)  increasing  demand  for  borrowing  by  MSEs;  (v)  lack  of  a \nmicrofinance-specific  legal  and  regulatory  framework;  and  (vi)  lack  of  accepted  industry-wide \nstandards. The project will direct assistance to achieve greater impact on these issues through \nmutually reinforcing activities. Poverty in rural areas is significantly greater than in urban areas and \nwomen face particular issues in accessing income-generating opportunities. A key focus of the \nproject will be improving access to credit and income-generating opportunities in rural areas and \nfor women, both directly and through improvements in the enabling environment. \n                                                \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2 ADB. 2000. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Microfinance and Employment \nProject for Papua New Guinea. Manila. Cofinanced by the Australian Agency for International Development. ", "2 \n6.  The  design  of  the  project  has  taken  into  consideration  the  key  learnings  from  the \nMicrofinance and Employment Project, i.e., that \n(i)  there is widespread demand for accessible savings services relative to borrowing; \n(ii)  different  MFIs  and  SLSs  require  greatly  differing  levels  of  support  to  properly \nmanage their assets, liabilities, and operations; \n(iii)  support for capacity development provided offsite, with poor follow up and mentoring \ncan reduce its long term effectiveness; \n(iv)  financial illiteracy, poor loan monitoring, and social and cultural factors have resulted \nin a high rate of arrears in all loan portfolios; and \n(v)  MFIs have avoided lending, particularly to MSEs, due to repayment concerns. \n7.  The project is consistent with the Government of PNG's Development Strategic Plan 2010\u2013\n2030, and Vision 2050, which recognize that significant progress is needed to extend financial \nservices  to  the  general  population. 3  It  also  aligns  with  the  government's  focus  on  rural \ndevelopment, as outlined in the 2010 budget. The project is also consistent with ADB's Strategy \n20204 and Pacific Approach 2010\u20132014,5 and is included in the PNG country operations business \nplan  2009\u20132011.6 The  Microfinance  and  Employment  Project  has  generated  opportunities  for \nADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department  that complement the project. Ongoing technical \nassistance is also available through the Pacific Private Sector Development Initiative\u2013Phase II.7 \n8.  Under  the  project,  and  more  generally,  ADB  will  cooperate,  liaise,  and  engage  with \ndevelopment partners focused on access to finance in PNG through coordination meetings and \nthrough  local  agency  coordinators.  These  will  include  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment as cofinancier of the project, the International Finance Corporation through its Pacific \nMicrofinance Initiative and its broader activities, and the multidonor Pacific Financial Inclusion \nProgram. Furthermore, under the project ADB will pursue synergies with development partners in \nrural development, including the World Bank and the New Zealand Aid Programme. More detail \ncan be found in the development coordination linked document (Appendix 2). \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The project\u2019s impact will be increased economic growth led by the private sector. The \noutcome  will  be  PFIs  sustainably  and  safely  providing  financial  services  to  a  substantially \nincreased number of clients across PNG.  \nC.  Outputs \n10.  The project\u2019s outputs are summarized in paras. 11\u201319. They are more fully described in the \ndetailed implementation plans and the project administration manual (PAM). In addition, further \ndetail can be found in the sector assessment summary, the summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy, and the gender action plan (Appendix 2). \n1.  Business  and  Product  Management  Capacity  of  Participating  Financial \nInstitutions is Increased \n11.  This output will address low and variable capacity to manage operations, the lack of on-site \ntraining and follow up, and poor rural outreach. The Microfinance Competence Centre lists more \nthan 90 organizations involved in microfinance in PNG. Twenty one of these organizations, which \n                                                \n3  Government of Papua New Guinea, Department of National Planning and Monitoring. 2010.

Providers of microfinance services will undergo institutional assessments to identify areas \nof need and will commit to a series of substantial but realistic development milestones. It is \nexpected that at least seven institutions will become PFIs.8 A system for independent monitoring, \nfeedback, and evaluation of training will be developed and implemented. PFIs will be monitored \nand assessed before moving to the next level of assistance. A comprehensive training program will \nbe developed for delivery to PFI staff. All training modules will incorporate gender issues, and \ntraining will be delivered in locations across PNG. PFIs will have the opportunity to receive on-site \ntechnical mentoring to strengthen their operations and systems. Business mentors will be assigned \nto each qualifying PFI to support implementation of improved accounting, management information \nsystems  (MISs),  reporting,  human  resources,  and  operational  and  business  management. \nInstitutions failing to respond to, or not institutionalizing, support measures will risk losing access to \nproject services. \n13.  All PFIs will receive training on data collection, reporting, analysis, and monitoring. Eligible \nPFIs will receive technical assistance to upgrade or replace their MISs, which will have the capacity \nto collect and report on sex-disaggregated data. Where appropriate, the project will provide support \nto PFIs to ensure their MISs can connect to electronic platforms such as mobile phone banking \n(MPB). This will extend rural outreach and reduce costs for PFIs by enabling clients to make \npayments remotely. The project will provide expertise in market research and microfinance product \ndevelopment.  The  consulting  team  will  assist  PFI  product  development  staff  to  develop  new \nproducts designed to service both existing and new market segments, including women and rural \nand agriculture-dependent communities.  \n2.  Clients and Potential Clients Understand and Know How to Access Financial \nServices for Personal or Business Use \n14.  Poor financial literacy is a key inhibitor to making financial services accessible to the rural \npoor. To address this, the project will undertake a large-scale financial literacy training program \ntargeting 120,000 clients and potential clients (at least 40% of whom will be women) of PFIs.9 \nProject  staff  will  conduct  initial  needs  assessments  and  design  the  training  program  and \nmaterials.10 It will include a training-of-trainers component enabling local \u201cmaster\u201d trainers to be \ntrained. Delivery of the training will be contracted to suitably qualified field contractors (such as \nwomen\u2019s  groups,  church  groups,  and  other  community-based  organizations)  or  to  PFIs \nthemselves. PFIs will be able to influence the schedule and location of the training in accordance \nwith their marketing and expansion strategies. This will ensure PFIs are able to offer financial \nservices to graduating training participants. To assist with project start up and organization of \nactivities, the government has requested that the training and curriculum development specialist \nand the microfinance institutional development specialist be engaged under advance action. \n                                                \n8  Eligibility criteria will be developed in consultation with the technical specialists. In general, the project will not support \nMFIs and SLSs that have no clear prospect of financial sustainability within approximately 3 years, or that are unwilling \nto actively utilize resources to improve their operations. \n9  Financial literacy pilot programs were undertaken in the later stages of ADB\u2019s Microfinance and Employment Project. It \nis too early to determine their success, though consultations during project design indicate that (i) there is a link \nbetween participation in financial literacy training and the opening of savings accounts, and (ii) the training was useful \nto participants in better understanding and managing their household finances. In addition, a recent study on the \nimpact of financial capability and competence on well-being in rural communities in the Fiji Islands found that there is a \npositive relationship between financial competence and household well-being in rural households. Households in which \nthe principal financial decision makers are financially competent are more likely to manage household cash flows and \nto use a budget to plan future expenditure than those that did not.

Suva. \n10The training program and materials will be adapted from existing international best practice financial literacy programs. \nWherever possible, curriculum and materials developed specifically for use in the Pacific context, and programs \ndeveloped for indigenous communities, will be referenced.  \n ", "4 \n15.  To address poor business skills, PFIs will be able to access business development skills \n(BDS)  training  for  clients  they  select  to  enable  them  to  better  manage  and  develop  their \nbusinesses.11 A network of BDS training providers throughout PNG will be identified and trained \nunder the project. A subsidized voucher system will enable PFIs to select from the short list of \ntraining providers for the provision of BDS training to clients. Skills training will be delivered to \n22,000 clients (20% of whom will be women), and at least 15% of the training courses will be \ndelivered  by  women  trainers  to  women-only  groups. 12  A  system  for  independent  training \nmonitoring, feedback, and evaluation will be developed and implemented.  \n3.  The  Association  of  Microfinance  Institutions  Monitors  Jointly  Agreed \nMicrofinance Industry Standards \n16.  To develop, implement, and assist institutions to understand the importance of best practice \nmicrofinance industry-wide standards, industry associations will receive support and training to \nbuild their capacity for advocacy and development of services to industry members. Associations \nwill be supported in identifying international and national financial and social benchmarks, such as \nthose developed and reported internationally by the Microfinance Information Exchange (including \nindicators  measuring  women\u2019s  and  rural  participation),  and  key  operational  indicators  to  be \nreported by association members and published on a quarterly basis.13 A website and publication \non industry reports will be developed to support industry activities, promote transparency, and \nencourage improvement of microfinance industry standards. \n4.  Bank  of  Papua  New  Guinea  Regulation  and  Supervision  of  Microfinance \nInstitutions and Savings and Loan Societies is Streamlined and Improved \n17.  To address the lack of a microfinance-specific legal and regulatory framework, the project \nwill propose a risk-based categorization of MFIs and SLSs. It will undertake a review of the Bank \nand Financial Institutions Act 2000 and the Savings and Loan Societies (Amendment) Act to \ndevelop recommendations for regulatory and supervisory requirements of each, as well as for \nMPB.14 The project will assist the BPNG to draft articles of regulation for MPB, SLSs, and each \ncategory of MFI. The BPNG will be assisted to develop a risk-based supervision approach to its off- \nand on-site supervision of MFIs, SLSs, and MPB providers.15 Operational procedures manuals will \nbe developed for the Supervision Department as well as for off- and on-site supervision procedures \nand implementation skills. Lastly, staff of the BPNG MFI and SLS supervision units will undergo \ntraining in all new procedures developed. \n5.  A Risk-Share Facility Supports Increased Micro and Small Enterprise Lending \n18.  To address the low level of, and increasing demand for, MSE lending, a risk-share facility \n(RSF) will be established to share some of the default risk on PFI MSE loan portfolios and \nencourage them to expand these portfolios and improve lending quality.16 This will complement \nefforts  under  other  project  outputs  and  lead  to  increased  demand  for  MSE  borrowing  and \ndevelopment of more relevant products, and wider outreach of lending for an expanded range of \n                                                \n11  Research shows that the provision of business training in microfinance leads to improved business knowledge, \npractices, and revenues. MFIs also had direct benefits through higher repayment and client retention rates. Karlan \nand Valdivia. 2006. Teaching Entrepreneurship: Impact of Business Training on Microfinance Clients and Institutions \nYale Economic Discussion Center Discussion Paper No. 941. New Haven. \n12  The remaining 85% of training courses delivered will be available to mixed or male-only groups. \n13  See www.themix.org and www.mixmarket.org   \n14  Other commercial laws will also be reviewed as necessary to ensure that any project recommendations are not in \nconflict with them. \n15  These articles of regulation contain specific directives that are not included in the legislation and are able to be \nmodified, as the need arises, by the BPNG governor. \n16  The demand for deposits in PNG outweighs the demand for borrowing. Thus, most institutions have enough funds to \nlend and therefore do not require direct financing. Instead they are constrained by the risks associated with lending \nand need assistance with risk mitigation. Lending quality is expected to improve as a result of the requirements set for \nparticipation in the facility. See the detailed implementation plans for more details (Appendix 2). \n ", "5 \nMSE borrowers and investments. It may also encourage development of commercially sustainable \nlinks with other donor programs and organizations. The RSF will be financed through ADB loan \nproceeds of $5.4 million. \n6.  The  Project  Management  Unit  Provides  Efficient  and  Effective  Project \nManagement Services \n19.  The project management unit (PMU) will coordinate the project, establish and manage \nproject accounts, prepare work plans, carry out procurement, prepare and submit relevant reports, \nand  monitor  and  evaluate  project  performance.  To  address  the  lack  of  capacity  within  the \nexecuting agency, support from key project consultants will be provided to assist the PMU.  \nD.  Investment and Financing Plans \n20.  The project is estimated to cost $24.06 million equivalent, including taxes and duties of \n$0.91  million.  The  investment  plan  is  summarized  in  Table  1.

The government has requested a loan in various currencies equivalent to SDR 8,412,000 \n($13.00 million) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to help finance the project. The loan will have \na 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an interest charge of 1.0% per annum during \nthe grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe  draft  loan  and  project  agreements.  Interest  during  implementation  on  the  loan  will  be \ncapitalized into the loan amount.17 \n22.  The Government of Australia will provide grant cofinancing equivalent to $6.00 million18 as \nproject specific funding to finance about 25% of the project costs, to be administered by ADB on a \njoint basis. The Government of PNG will provide counterpart funding of $3.09 million equivalent, or \n                                                \n17  Transportation and insurance are eligible expenses for ADB financing. \n18  Includes an ADB administration fee of $250,000. \n ", "6 \n13% of the project cost, in the form of cash and in-kind contributions. The counterpart cash will be \nused to finance taxes and duties, and incremental recurrent costs. PFIs will fund the costs of \ncomputer hardware and software and 25% of their staff training costs, largely through capital \nincreases,  which  are  likely  to  be  required  by  regulatory  capital  requirements.  Beneficiary \nhouseholds and businesses accessing project training services will finance 16% of such costs.19 \nThe financing plan is shown in Table 2, and further detail is available in the PAM (Appendix 2).  \nTable 2: Financing Plan \nAmount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)    (%) \nAsian Development Bank  13.00    54.0 \nGovernment of Australiaa  6.00    25.0 \nPFIs and beneficiaries  1.97    8.2 \nGovernment  3.09    12.8 \nTotal  24.06    100.0 \nPFI = participating financial institution. \na This amount includes the Asian Development Bank\u2019s administration fee, audit cost, bank charges, and provision for \nforeign exchange fluctuations (if any), to the extent that these items are not covered by the interest and investment \nincome earned on this grant, or any additional grant contribution by the Government of Australia. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n23.  The  National  Centre  for  Financial  Inclusion  (NCFI)  will  be  formed  from  the  current \nMicrofinance  Competence  Centre  under  the  Institute  for  Banking  and  Business  Management \n(IBBM). Until NCFI is established, IBBM will be the implementing agency for outputs 1, 2, and 3 \nand will be assisted by about seven administrative staff that will be recruited to work in the NCFI. \nOnce established as an independent entity, within approximately 9 months of the beginning of \nproject implementation, the NCFI will replace the IBBM as the implementing agency for outputs 1, \n2, and 3. The NCFI will also be supported by international and national consultants. It will generate \nrevenue from PFIs and client contributions to training costs, as well as from other services it may \nprovide. At the time of the project's midterm review, an assessment of the post-project role of the \nNCFI will be undertaken, and a plan developed to ensure that it is able to generate sufficient \nrevenue or attract further donor funding to continue its activities. \n24.

Significant training services will be delivered through the project across PNG. Field level \nservice delivery contractors will be engaged to deliver this training, and a panel of stakeholders \nand consultants will be established within the NCFI to manage the process. Contractors will be \nselected following ADB procurement procedures.  \n26.  The majority of international and national consultants will be recruited through a firm using \nquality-and cost-based selection (QCBS) with a quality:cost ratio of 80:20. The government has \nrequested that one international and one national consultant be engaged as individuals under \nadvance action to enable project start-up. Business mentors will be hired through a firm using \n ", "8 \nQCBS with a quality:cost ratio of 70:30. A services firm will be engaged through QCBS to provide \nmanagement services for the RSF using an 80:20 quality:cost ratio, modified for evaluation criteria. \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n27.  The project is expected to increase access to safe and reliable financial services for people \nliving throughout PNG, particularly in rural areas. Extensive consultations and focus groups were \nundertaken with potential financial services users, policy makers, civil society, the private sector, \neducational institutions, and development partners during project design. Key stakeholders also \nparticipated in a workshop to review and comment on the final proposed project design. There is \nbroad-based support for the project from all sectors. \nA.  Economic and Financial \n28.  Over the project period, approximately 18,000 jobs will be created.20 It is estimated that PFI \nloans outstanding will increase by more than $54.00 million, to an additional 52,000 borrowers. \nApproximately 60% of this increase, or around $33.60 million, will be in MSE borrowing. Savings \ndeposits  are  expected to  increase  by  more  than  $100.00  million  and  the  number  of  deposit \nhouseholds will increase by more than 160,000.21 An economic and financial internal rate of return \nanalysis  was  undertaken  for  the  proposed  project.  The  results  of  this  analysis  are  heavily \ninfluenced by the mix of activities selected to represent a reasonable activity mix; a different mix \nwould yield a different result. As such, overall rates of return are not shown. Details are in the \neconomic and financial analysis (Appendix 2). \nB.  Governance \n29.  The BPNG was the executing agency for the ADB Microfinance and Employment Project \nand has the structure, skills, capacity, and authority to implement the project by establishing a \nPMU inside the BPNG and a project implementation unit inside the Supervision Department. \nFinancial management and procurement assessments found satisfactory capacity in the BPNG. \nThe IBBM has also demonstrated satisfactory financial management skills, in particular as the \nimplementing agency for a major component of the Microfinance and Employment Project. The \nimplementing agency for the RSF will be the Department of Treasury, although the facility will be \nmanaged by a professional manager. International and national consultants have been included in \nproject design to support financial management and procurement activities. While the financial \nmanagement, procurement, and corruption situation in PNG remains weak, the assessments show \nfew concerns regarding such capabilities within the relevant agencies. \n30.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  BPNG.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the PAM (Appendix 2).  \nC.  Poverty and Social \n31.  Throughout PNG, lack of access to financial services, particularly in rural areas, is a major \nconstraint on income growth for households and MSEs.22 The project\u2019s activities will increase \n                                                \n20  This is based on one full time job being created for each $1,843 in MSE loan disbursements. \n21  Under the project, it is assumed that each household has approximately 1.4 deposit accounts. The total increase in \nthe number of deposit accounts as a result of the project is therefore about 250,000. Household disposable income is \na major determinant of savings volumes and households are the key focus for development of new savings products. \nFor more detail, see the economic and financial analysis (Appendix 2). \n22  It is estimated that less than 16% of the population use financial services. ADB. 2009. Country Strategy and Program \nMidterm Review: Papua New Guinea, 2006\u20132010. Manila. \n ", "9 \noutreach and access by building the capacity of PFIs to deliver services and products in rural \nareas. This will increase rural incomes and reduce poverty by stimulating informal business activity \n(via loan services), balancing income and expenditure, and increasing asset accumulation (via \nsavings services). The delivery of training to clients will improve their ability to access and use \nfinancial services. Women will benefit from (i) financial literacy training; (ii)  BDS training; (iii) \ndevelopment of new, women-focused products; (iv) gender awareness training for PFI staff; (v) \nimproved monitoring of services and participation; and (vi) links to women-focused programs. \nD.  Safeguards \n32.  The project is classified as environmental category FI (financial intermediary), although it \nwill be treated as category C as it is unlikely to have adverse environmental impacts. Urban \nmicrofinance borrowing is mainly for retail activities and transport. Rural microfinance borrowing is \nmainly for agriculture and consumer finance, such as school fees and life-cycle events such as \nbirths and funerals. The project will not finance any of the activities included in ADB\u2019s prohibited \ninvestment activities list. \n33.  The project will have no involuntary resettlement impacts and has been classified category \nC.  The  project  does  not  specifically  target  indigenous  peoples  as  the  population  is  largely \nindigenous. Its goal to increase access to financial services will have only positive impacts for a \nbroad  cross-section  of  the  population,  particularly  women  and  those  living  in  rural  areas. \nAccordingly,  although  the  project  has  been  classified  B,  an  indigenous  peoples  plan  is  not \nrequired. Wide-ranging consultations across PNG to ensure that project design is sympathetic to \nthe needs of PNG\u2019s people confirmed overwhelming support for the project. The project has been \ncategorized as effective gender mainstreaming. \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n34.  Major risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 4 and described in detail in \nthe risk assessment and risk management plan (Appendix 2).  \nTable 4: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nProject Management and Coordination \nPoor project management and project  BPNG has previous experience in managing ADB projects. \ncomponents not effectively implemented \nPMU staff will be trained in monitoring and disbursements. \nPIUs have skilled staff, supported by project consultants. \nProcurement \nLack of available, appropriately qualified  BPNG  and  implementing  agencies  have  strong  staff  and \nnational consultants and counterpart staff  experience with procuring qualified consulting services.  \nDelays in procurement hinder  A national procurement specialist will be engaged to establish \nimplementation of key project activities   and facilitate procurement processes. \nAn  international  MIS  specialist  will  support  the  PIU  in \nidentifying and procuring appropriate MISs for PFIs. \nSocioeconomic \nCommunity and/or social constraints  Inclusive financial literacy training within communities  \nrestrict entrepreneurial effort, demand for \nInvolvement of women \nloans, and repayment capacity (refer to \nPAM Section VIII for detail)  Business skills training \nDeposit accounts encouraged \n ", "10 \nRisks  Mitigating Measures \nMicrofinance Sector \nPFIs unable to achieve financial viability  Improved supervision and regulation of MFIs and SLSs \nImproved accounting and loan portfolio management within \nPFIs, including through business mentor training \nInstallation of improved management and control systems \nDesign and introduction of more suitable products \nPFIs averse to expansion of financial  Establishment of risk-share facility \nservice outreach, especially in rural areas \nMarket research/development of new products for PFIs \nPFIs lead in financial literacy and business skills training \nNational  and  provincial  workshops  held  to  encourage \ncommercial links with variety of organizations \nADB = Asian Development Bank, BPNG = Bank of Papua New Guinea, MFI = microfinance institution, MIS = \nmanagement information system, PAM = project administration manual, PFI = participating financial institution, PIU = \nproject implementation unit, PMU = project management unit, SLS = savings and loan society.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \nIV.  ASSURANCES AND CONDITIONS \n35.  The government and the BPNG have assured ADB that implementation of the project shall \nconform  to  all  applicable  ADB  policies  including  those  concerning  anticorruption  measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail in \nthe PAM and loan documents.
