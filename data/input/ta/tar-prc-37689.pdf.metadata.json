In October 2003, on the request of the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC), the Asian Develoment Bank (ADB) included in its country strategy and program (2004\u2013 \n2006) for the PRC a technical assistance (TA) project, tentatively entitled Developing Poverty \nImpact Indicators and Assessment Methodology for ADB Operations.   \n \n2.   In  May  2004,  a  Fact-Finding  Mission  visited  Beijing  and  Hebei  Province  to  hold \nextensive discussions and consultations on the proposed TA\u2019s nature, objectives, scope and \ncoverage,  key  activities,  and  implementation  arrangements  and  other  related  issues.  The \nmeetings were conducted with relevant officials of the proposed Executing Agency for the TA \nproject (the Rural Survey Organization [RSO] of the National Bureau of Statistics [NBS]), other \ngovernment agencies, and aid agencies. At the end of the Mission, a general understanding on \nthe TA objective, scope, financing, and implementation arrangements was reached,1 including \nthe change of the title of the TA project to Developing a Poverty Monitoring System at the \nCounty Level.2 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The  demand  for  county-level  information  in  the  PRC  is  growing  for  the  following \nreasons.3 First, rural poverty4  is  concentrated  in  relatively  small  areas  or  poverty  pockets, \nincluding counties, townships, and villages.5 Second, poverty reduction projects are increasingly \ndesigned to target small and vulnerable areas and the poor directly. Third, there is an increasing \ndemand  for  monitoring  the  outcomes  and  impacts  of  the  projects  at  the  subnational  level. \nFinally,  there  has  been  an  increasing  use  of  subnational  statistics  for  allocating  limited \nresources. \n \n4.   The current poverty monitoring system of rural PRC still focuses on producing national \nand provincial statistical information; hence, there is lack of information at the county level.6 This \nlack of information on poverty-related indicators at the county level is due mainly to lack of \ncapacity of RSO county offices to produce the required indicators. In recent years, a series of \nreforms  related  to  an  indicator  system,  and  methods  of  data  collection,  processing,  and \ndissemination were carried out at the national level, and the capacity of NBS, including RSO, \nand its provincial branches has improved. But statistical capacity at the county level has not \nbeen strengthened; therefore, there is no capability to produce a sufficient number of poverty- \nrelated indicators7 to reflect the county\u2019s social and poverty condition. \n \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) in June 2004. \n2 The change was made because the ongoing RETA 6073: Developing Tools for Assessing the Effectiveness of \nADB Operations in Reducing Poverty that also covers the PRC, will develop poverty impact indicators and \nassessment methodology of projects. The present TA will use some of the RETA results.  \n3 Intensive discussions with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Leading Group on Poverty \nReduction (LGOP) confirm the need for developing a county-level poverty monitoring system. Further discussions \nwith officials of the Ruan Ping County of Hebei Province support this view. \n4  Poverty includes income and nonincome poverty. \n5  ADB\u2019s Poverty Profile for the PRC (March 2004) notes that nearly half of the rural poor live in counties not \nclassified as national poverty counties. \n6  Particularly on social statistics/poverty-related indicators, as until the end of the last century, the state statistical \nsystem of the PRC dealt mainly with economic statistics, due partly to a long history of economic planning \nmechanisms. \n7  Some indicators could be derived from the national sample surveys. \n ", "2    \n5.  Because the current poverty monitoring system of rural PRC cannot supply the required \ncounty-level information, there is an urgent need to develop a county-level poverty monitoring \nsystem that can produce regular, relevant, and timely poverty-related indicators, which will help \nimprove county-level targeting of poverty reduction projects and allow a better and more regular \npoverty impact evaluation. This need translates into the need to strengthen the capacity of RSO \ncounty offices8 in providing such poverty-related indicators. \n \n6.   There are at least two reasons why RSO is requesting ADB assistance to develop a \npoverty  monitoring  system  at  the  county  level.9  First,  probably  the  strongest  reason  for \nsupporting RSO and its county  offices  is  that  RSO  is  the  only  agency  whose  figures  are \nconsidered official and it has a clear mandate to supply official statistics that should be used for \npolicy and decisionmaking. The main job of RSO is to collect statistics, including rural statistics, \nwhile  other  government  agencies  carry  out  data  collection  activities  to  better  steer  their \nprograms/projects and show their impacts. Improving the capacity of RSO county offices to \nproduce  the  required  statistical  information  will  be  instrumental  in  implementing  a  poverty \nmonitoring system. Second, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the \nLeading Group on Poverty Reduction (LGOP) have recently developed a broad framework for \npoverty  monitoring,  including  an  indicator  system  and  institutional  arrangements,  but  \nimplementation of this framework is still unclear. This TA will develop a clear methodological \napproach10  and  implementation  mechanism  that  can  help  RSO  develop  and  implement  a \ncounty-level poverty monitoring system.11  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.   Purpose and Output \n \n7.  The TA will help RSO develop a county poverty monitoring system that provides timely, \nrelevant, and quality statistical information useful for poverty-related analysis to support policy- \nand decision-making processes. The emphasis will be on strengthening the capacity of RSO \ncounty  offices  in  supplying  the  required  statistical  information  for  poverty  monitoring.  The \ninformation will be based on both survey data and administrative records. The main TA output \nwill be a prototype of a county poverty monitoring system.12  \n   \nB.    Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.   The TA activities will be carried out at Chuxiong Prefecture of Yunnan Province. There \nare three main reasons for selecting this prefecture: (i) it has only eight counties, making it \n                                                 \n8  In some counties, RSO has a separate county office, while in others, RSO county office/staff is part of the county \nState Statistical Bureau (SSB). \n9  The German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) has been piloting a poverty monitoring system in Jiangxi \nProvince, using mainly a participatory approach, but it does not involve strengthening the county offices of \nRSO/SSB. As the variation in poverty-related indicators across the province is high, due to the fact that the PRC is \na vast country, a poverty monitoring system applicable to a certain area may not be appropriate for other areas. \n10 For instance, the proposed monitoring system will produce indicators based on the survey (survey-based poverty \ncorrelates) and county-specific indicators derived from discussions/consultations with stakeholders. \n11 It will include streamlining the indicators system (which currently has more than 75 indicators) developed by the \nUNDP/LGOP  broad  framework  for  poverty  monitoring,  constructing  feasible  data-collecting  quality  control \nmechanism, strengthening analytical capability, and improving dissemination procedures. The TA will use the tools \ndeveloped under RETA 6073 (footnote 2) and will provide information that can be used for poverty impact \nassessment of ADB projects. \n12 It will include poverty-monitoring instruments, such as poverty indicators, questionnaires, manuals, data processing \nprocedure, and analytical procedures. The TA will also provide the necessary statistical information useful for \nassessing the poverty impact of ADB projects in the TA counties. \n ", "      3\n   \npossible to cover all counties with the existing TA budget; (ii) all counties in this prefecture are \nincluded in the national poverty reduction project; and (iii) because some of its poor counties are \nadjacent  to  two  ADB  projects,13  the  TA  can  provide  some  useful  information  to  assist  in \nmonitoring the impact of ADB projects on poverty reduction. The TA will be implemented in two \nstages: (i) a prototype of a poverty monitoring system in one county will be developed, tested, \nfinalized,  and  implemented;  and  (ii)  the  system  will  then  be  replicated  in  the  seven  other \ncounties at Chuxiong Prefecture, with some appropriate modifications. The poverty monitoring \nsystem will be based on the quantitative/statistical approach.14 \n \n9.   Key  activities  in  developing  a  poverty  monitoring  system  will  have  six  interrelated \ncomponents: (i) determination of county poverty-related indicators; (ii) review of existing data \ncollection mechanisms; (iii) development of a county poverty monitoring system; (iv) pilot test of \nthe  proposed  system,  finalization,  and  implementation  in  one  county;  (v)  extension  of \nimplementation of the proposed system to the seven other counties; and (vi) dissemination. In \naddition, there will be a number of training activities. In implementing the key activities, the \nparticipation and involvement of relevant agencies will be ensured, particularly in translating \nstatistical or poverty-related information into policy and interventions. \n \n1.   Determination of County Poverty-Related Indicators \n \n10.  This component will involve discussions with various county stakeholders on several \naspects of county-level poverty-related information, including (i) identification of the type of \ninformation required and (ii) its use for policy- and decision-making processes. Specifically, \ncounty poverty-related indicators will be identified and selected using survey data in a number of \nsectors15 and a participatory approach through discussions with various stakeholders. Ethnic \nminority communities will be represented in the stakeholders discussions/consultations during \nthis stage and also during TA implementation. \n2.    Review of Existing Data Collection Mechanisms \n \n11.     There will be a detailed review of both (i) the primary data collection mechanism, and (ii) \nthe secondary data collection mechanism.16 The review will include available data that have \nbeen generated by both data collection mechanisms. The (income and nonincome poverty) data \ngap that should be bridged by a county poverty monitoring system will be identified.17 The \nexisting data flow within various data producers, as well as from data producers to data users, \nwill also be examined as input in developing the county poverty monitoring system. In its data \ncollection activities, the TA will produce subcounty information and disaggregated data at village \nlevel (especially in the poor villages), including those on ethnic-groups and labor migration. The \nTA will also look into the complementation of micro (county-level) with macro (prefecture- and \nprovincial-level) data to provide a deeper understanding of the macro features of poverty. \n                                                 \n13 The 1998 completed Chuxiong-Dali road project and the ongoing railway project from Dali to Lijiang. Another \nreason for selecting Chuxiong is that in this prefecture there are many pockets of poverty among ethnic minorities. \n14 However, in identifying and selecting poverty-related indicators, a participatory approach will be used by having \ndiscussion/consultations with stakeholders. \n15 For infrastructure projects, the TA will use the results of RETA 6073 (footnote 2) to derive positive indicators \n(survey-based poverty correlates). To the extent possible, the  methodology developed in RETA 6073 will be \nreplicated for sectors other than infrastructure. \n16 Primary data collection activity refers to survey activities to collect data from primary sources (in this case, \nhouseholds),  while  secondary  data  collection  activity  refers  to  data  compilation  from  secondary  sources \n(administrative data). \n17 To the extent possible, the TA will identify data gaps on the microspecific (village-level) features and underlying \ncauses of poverty. \n   \n   ", "4    \n \n3.   Development of a County Poverty Monitoring System \n \n12.   Some key activities of this component will be (i) finalizing an agreed-upon set of county \npoverty-related indicators,  (ii) identifying a data collection mechanism for each indicator, (iii) \nconstructing a set of data collection instruments to compile primary and secondary data required \nfor deriving the indicators,18 (iv) selecting appropriate procedure(s) to derive the indicators, and \n(v) determining  ways of presenting the indicators. \n4.    Pilot Test of the Proposed System in One County \n \n13.  The proposed system will first be pilot-tested in one county. The results of the pilot test \nwill be analyzed, and the proposed system will be improved and implemented in the county.  \n5.    Extension of Implementation to Seven Other Counties \n \n14.  The  developed  system  will  be  replicated  in  the  seven  other  counties,  with  some \nappropriate modifications. \n \n6.    Dissemination  \n \n15.   This component will include (i) preparing the final report of the implementation of the \ncounty poverty monitoring system, and (ii) holding seminars/workshops/meetings at national, \nprovincial,  and  county  levels  to  discuss  and  disseminate  the  main  TA  findings  to  various \nGovernment officials, academia, and development partners. \n16.  The TA project will include some capacity-building activities, such as (i) an international \nworkshop in Beijing on a poverty monitoring system, covering three to four countries in the \nregion (local-level officials will be invited to participate), (ii) a study visit by a maximum four RSO \nofficials to neighboring countries, and (iii) a number of in-country training activities and meetings \n(national, provincial, and county levels)  covering  discussions  on  poverty-related indicators, \ntraining activities for the survey, and the proposed poverty monitoring system.  \nC.   Cost and Financing  \n \n17.   The total cost of the TA will be $440,000 equivalent, of which $100,000 is in foreign \nexchange and $340,000 equivalent is in local currency (Appendix 2). The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, covering the entire foreign exchange \ncost and $200,000 equivalent of the local currency cost, and administered by ADB. The TA fund \nwill be used mainly for the services of the international and domestic consultants, computing \nequipment, survey-related training and workshop activities, and support for the data collection \nactivities. The Government will provide $140,000 equivalent as counterpart contribution in the \nform of counterpart staff, office, local transport, and administration and support.  \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 28 months beginning in December 2004 and ending in \nMarch 2007. RSO of NBS will be the Executing Agency. The Development Indicators and Policy \nResearch Division (ERDI) of ADB will administer the TA. RSO will appoint a project director who \n                                                 \n18 The instruments will have to be field-tested and improved before being adopted. \n ", "      5\n   \nwill be responsible for coordinating with ERDI, as well as for day-to-day project implementation, \nsupervision of consultants\u2019 work, and review of the consultants\u2019 reports. \n \n19.  The TA will finance consulting services of 13 person-months: 3 international and 10 \ndomestic. The consultants will be recruited individually, following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic \nconsultants.  The  consultants  will  provide  reports  within  1  week  after  completing  their \nassignment. The terms of reference of the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.    The TA will finance the purchase of computing equipment. RSO will procure computing \nequipment in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The TA will also finance the \npilot survey and the actual survey activities (collecting data from primary sources), such as \ntraining  supervisors  and  enumerators,  preparing  and  printing  survey  instruments,  field \noperation, data validation, data processing and analysis, and publication. Data collection from \nsecondary sources (administrative data) will also be supported to complement the information \nobtained from the primary sources. RSO will publish the report on the county poverty monitoring \nsystem and county-level poverty-related data produced under the TA. \n \n21.     The  TA  will  support  both  in-country  and  international  training  of  RSO  and  its \nprefecture/county staff. A maximum of four RSO staff members will participate in a study visit to \none or two countries in the region to learn about the local-level poverty monitoring system of \nthose countries. The TA will also finance an international workshop in Beijing, a number of in-\ncountry workshops/seminars, and training courses for RSO statistical staff and the staffs of its \nprefecture and county offices. The Government will provide the necessary staff and venues for \nthe training courses. \n \n22.   The  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed  to  and  liquidated  by  RSO  in  accordance  with  the \nprocedures and requirements of ADB\u2019s advance payment facility. \n \nIV.   THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n23.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China to be financed on a grant basis by the Poverty Reduction \nCooperation Fund for Developing a Poverty Monitoring System at the County Level, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n \n   \n   ", "6   Appendix 1   \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n       \n  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \n     \n       \nGoal       \nEffective policy analysis of  Examples of policy  Asian Develoment \nthe poverty reduction  reports by the county  Bank (ADB) staff \nstrategy available to county  governor offices in  assessment 3 years \ndecision makers in  Chuxiong Prefecture  after completion \nChuxiong Prefecture of   \nYunnan Province  Survey of the county-\n  level decision makers \n \n       \nPurpose      Risk \nA well-functioning county  Timely and regular  Review missions  Government may not be \npoverty monitoring system  availability of county  County publications  willing to use the results of \nat eight Rural Survey  poverty-related indicators  the system for poverty \nOrganization (RSO) county  in Chuxiong Prefecture   monitoring. \noffices in Chuxiong   \nPrefecture \n       \nOutputs      Risk \n1.
