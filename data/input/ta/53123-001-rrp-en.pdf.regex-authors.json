THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed senior \nunsecured loan of up to $80,000,000, comprising (i) an A loan of up to $30,000,000 (or its rupiah \nequivalent); and (ii) a B loan of up to $50,000,000 (in the event that the A loan or part of it is \ndenominated in US dollars) to PT Indosurya Inti Finance (Indosurya) for the Small and Medium-\nSized Enterprise Financing Project in Indonesia. \n \n2.  The proposed loan to Indosurya will support the onlending and expansion of its small and \nmedium-sized enterprise (SME) loan portfolio. Funding from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nwill provide support for critically needed financial products and services to this underserved \nsegment in Indonesia with targeted support for women SME clients and borrowers in less-\npenetrated geographical markets, primarily outside Greater Jakarta. \n \nII.  THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \n \nA.  Investment Identification and Description \n \n3.  Indonesia\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) has grown by an average of 5.5% annually \nsince 2010, most recently expanding at 5.1% in 2017 and 5.2% in 2018. The economy is projected \nto grow at 5.2% in 2019 and 5.3% in 2020.1 In 2018, increased volatility in emerging markets \nimpacted Indonesia, with the rupiah depreciating sharply against the US dollar. Bank Indonesia\u2019s \nresponse of tightening monetary policy is credited with restoring stability and moderating inflation \nexpectations from 3.8% in 2017 to 3.4% in 2018 and 3.5% in 2019.2 Despite these challenges, \nIndonesia\u2019s investment-grade credit ratings were reaffirmed or even improved; Moody\u2019s Investor\u2019s \nService upgraded its rating to Baa2 in 2018.3. As Indonesia\u2019s economic growth and credit ratings \nstrengthen, new ways to accelerate sustainable and inclusive economic growth are needed to \nmeet ambitious economic and social targets, and to address household income inequality.4 \n \n4.  Finance sector. Although a large economy, Indonesia\u2019s finance sector is small and \nunderdeveloped relative to its regional peers.5 Total financial system assets amounted to about \n72% of GDP in 2017. Banks dominate the sector with 74% of assets; securities companies \naccount for 10% of assets; and the mutual funds industry, insurance companies, pension funds, \nand  multifinance  companies  (MFCs)  make  up  the  rest. 6  The  banking  system  is  highly \nconcentrated with the top 20 banks accounting for about 80% of total assets.

Bank \nIndonesia\u2019s raising of policy rates by 1.75%\u20135.75% over the year was seen as one of the most aggressive policy \nreactions among emerging market central banks. \n3  Moody\u2019s Investors Service. 2018.

It has adequate asset quality with a nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio of 3%;8 \nand is profitable, with a return on average assets of 2% and a return on average equity of 20%. \nThe Financial Services Authority of Indonesia (OJK) was established as an integrated regulator \nin 2011 and has overseen the entire finance sector since 2012, including Basel III implementation. \nIn 2016, the Bank for International Settlements rated Indonesia largely compliant with the Basel \nIII framework.9 \n \n5.  Small and medium-sized enterprise sector. Most enterprises in Indonesia are small, \nusually  employing  fewer  than  20  people.  However,  their  contribution  to  employment  is \nsignificant\u2014about 76%. It is estimated that there are more than 59 million enterprises, of which \njust over 1% are considered SMEs10 and about 98% are considered microenterprises.11 Women \nown almost 50% of SMEs in Indonesia.12 SMEs contribute about 22% to GDP, or 57% if \nmicroenterprises are included. The government prioritizes development of the sector. It has \ndevised a legal framework13 involved several ministries in SME policy, (notably the Ministry of \nCooperatives and SMEs); and has established a significant number of government programs \nsupporting SMEs.14 \n \n6.  Access to  finance.  The  proportion  of  the  adult  population  having  a  bank  account \nincreased from 36% in 2014 to about 49% in 2017\u2014the highest growth rate in the region.15 \nHowever, access to credit remains very limited. Based on the 2017 Global Findex Data, only 18% \nof men and 17% of women in Indonesia borrowed from a financial institution, while 40% of men \nand 32% of women borrowed from family or friends and only 6% of borrowers reported that the \nmoney was used to start, operate, and/or expand a farm or business (footnote 15). The geography \nof the country also presents an additional barrier to credit access. In 2016, 69% of all formal loans \nwere extended to borrowers in Java.16 \n \n7.  Lending to SMEs has not been an area of primary focus for the banking sector. Some \nrural banks have catered to SMEs, although these banks tend to be smaller and their operations \nrestricted by regulation to a designated territory. Only 12% of SMEs in the country have access \nto formal credit (footnote 11), underscoring the limited depth of financial inclusion. Women, in \n \n7  The four largest banks are the three state-owned banks: PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia Tbk, PT Bank Mandiri Tbk, and \nPT Bank Negara Indonesia Tbk, and the privately owned PT Bank Central Asia Tbk ranked third in asset size.  \n8  An NPL is a loan that is past due for payment by 90 days. \n9  Bank for International Settlements, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. 2016.

A World Bank study estimated the SME financing \ngap at more than $165 billion.19 \n \n8.  Multifinance companies. Nonbank financial institutions, especially MFCs, have been the \nprimary financial institutions catering to SMEs. MFCs are licensed, non-deposit-taking financial \ninstitutions  permitted  to  offer  financial  services  in  leasing,  consumer  financing,  credit  card \nfinancing, and factoring. In 2019, about 185 MFCs operated in Indonesia, the largest of which are \nassociated  with  larger  banks  or  auto  manufacturers.  MFCs  mostly  target  retail  borrowers, \nfinancing vehicle purchases (70%), followed by wholesale leasing (27%) and factoring (3%) \n(footnote 19). MFCs are regulated by the OJK under a framework that encourages portfolio \ndiversification, extending their range of permissible activities to include direct investment and \nworking capital financing.20 \n \n9.  Rationale.  To support SMEs\u2019  access to  finance,  ADB\u2019s  nonsovereign  operations  is \npursuing financial institutions in Indonesia that have a successful track record in servicing this \nsegment. Most recently, ADB has been supporting microfinance institutions directly and through \nthe Microfinance Risk Participation and Guarantee Program.21 The proposed transaction would \nbe the first nonsovereign operations project to partner with an MFC in Indonesia to fund SMEs. \nADB selected Indosurya because of its focused strategy of funding SMEs through targeted \noutreach. Established in 2011, Indosurya now spans 70 branches along with various alliances \nwith local agents and fintech partners. Indosurya received a national rating of A\u2013 by Fitch Ratings \nin  May  2018  as  a  result  of  its  satisfactory  asset  quality,  strong  profitability,  and  robust \ncapitalization.22 \n \n10.  The  design  of  the  proposed  transaction  builds  on  lessons  from  previous  ADB \nnonsovereign operations supporting SME financing in other countries. It incorporates realistic \ndevelopment targets and indicators; for the women SME targets, it includes a gender action plan \n(GAP) to enhance business sustainability. It also provides the option of local currency financing \nto avoid currency induced credit risk of ADB\u2019s borrowers and their SME clients. Finally, a proposed \ntechnical assistance (TA), which will be approved separately, will also enhance Indosurya\u2019s asset-\nliability management, ensuring a more robust financing strategy.   \n   \n \n17 DBS Bank Ltd. 2017.

Indosurya is a private, family-owned MFC based in Jakarta, specializing in collateral-\nbased SME financing through four main products: investment financing, working capital financing, \nmultipurpose financing, and Sharia-compliant financing. In addition to its large branch network, in \n2017 Indosurya partnered with several peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms to increase the share of \nsmaller loans. Indosurya had 991 staff members in April 2019.23 \n12.  Indosurya manages a loan portfolio of about Rp3.6 trillion which represent about 1% of \nthe estimated MFC market. The portfolio grew at a compound annual rate of 21% from 2014 to \n2018, and the company forecasts continued robust portfolio growth of 18% annually from 2019 to \n2023 by focusing on the untapped SME market. Indosurya also tries to lower its cost of funds to \nbetter compete with commercial banks for repeat business clients on their second loan cycles. \nIndosurya  is  streamlining  its  processing  to  lower  operational  costs  by  making  information \ntechnology  investments  to  (i)  develop  an  online  platform  to  support  end-to-end  customer \napplication appraisal to disbursement and collections processing, (ii) enhance its existing core \nsystem to improve underwriting processes, and (iii) strengthen its liquidity and longer-term funding \nmanagement. \n \nC.  Ownership, Management, and Governance \n \n13.  Ownership. Indosurya is part of a group of companies owned by the Surya family.24 The \nfounder of Indosurya, Surya Effendy is the chair of its board of commissioners (BOC). The \nfounder\u2019s son, Henry Surya is the chief executive officer and chair of the board of directors (BOD). \nIntegrity due diligence was conducted and identified no significant or potentially significant \nintegrity risks.25 All of the ultimate beneficial owners have been identified and they do not appear \nto be subjects of any unresolved or substantiated adverse media or other information. Two \nmembers of the BOC are politically exposed persons, having served as directors in state-owned \nentities; however, neither is the subject of any adverse news. ADB\u2019s review of the entity does not \ngive ADB cause to believe that it is being used for money laundering or the financing of terrorism. \nTax integrity due diligence was not required.26 \n \n14.  Management. In addition to Henry Surya as chief executive officer, the key management \nteam comprises non-family members, each with more than 10 years of experience in banking and \nMFC operations. They include Mulyadi Tjung, managing director; Junus Octora, chief financial \nofficer; and Henli Salim, chief operating officer. \n \n15.  Governance structure. Indosurya\u2019s governance structure is based on the regulatory \nframework established by the OJK.27 It functions in a two-tier board structure comprising the BOC, \nwhich  is  composed  of  three  commissioners,  including  the  chair,  Surya  Effendy,  and  two \nindependent commissioners; and the BOD, which is composed of five directors, including the \n \n23 Indosurya also has about 5,000 external agents working on commission basis to originate and service clients. \n24 The group companies include activities in multifinance, asset management, securities, life insurance, business \nprocess reengineering banking, microfinancing, cooperatives, and real estate. \n25 ADB. 2003.

There is a centralized credit assessment with mandatory client visits \nand collateral confirmation. Credit assessment also uses client cash-flow-based appraisal for \ncredit scoring.

ADB will provide a senior unsecured loan to Indosurya of up to $30 million (or its rupiah, \nequivalent) of up to 5 years. In the event that the A loan or part of it is denominated in US dollars, \nADB expects to syndicate a B loan of up to $50 million by mobilizing impact investors and other \neligible B loan participants, subject to market conditions. ADB also expects to provide a TA to \nsupport and enhance Indosurya\u2019s asset and liability management framework.31 \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  Use of proceeds. Indosurya will use the total proceeds of ADB\u2019s facility to finance SMEs \nin Indonesia with at least 25% of ADB\u2019s A loan  used to fund women SME clients32 and at least \n25% of ADB\u2019s funds would support SMEs in less-penetrated geographical markets, primarily \noutside Greater Jakarta.33  The B loan, dependent on the A loan, or part of it, being denominated \nin US dollars, would be targeted at up to $50 million. \n \n19.  Reporting arrangements. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department will carry out \nproject monitoring. Indosurya will prepare and submit to ADB financial and monitoring reports at \npredetermined  regular  intervals  and  as  requested,  including  (i)  annual  audited  financial \nstatements; (ii) quarterly unaudited financial statements; (iii) quarterly compliance certificates for \nloan covenants; (iv) semiannual reporting on the loan portfolio; and (v) annual reporting on \n \n28 BKR International is an international association of independent audit firms. BKR International was sixth in the 2017 \nInternational Accounting Bulletin rankings for global associations. \n29 IFC has provided technical assistance (TA) to Indosurya to upgrade its risk management framework, with a particular \nfocus on credit scoring. \n30 The Credit Committee comprises the head of credit; the risk, appraisal, and legal teams; and the BOD, which is \nultimately responsible for overall risk management. The committee meets at least twice a week. \n31 The TA will be processed separately. \n32 Women SME clients are defined as entities with at least one of these characteristics (i) at least 60% of senior \nmanagers are women, (ii) women control at least 50% of the ownership, and/or (iii) at least 50% of the registered \nemployees are women. \n33 Greater Jakarta refers to the area encompassing Jakarta as well as the neighboring cities of Bogor, Depok, \nTangerang, and Bekasi, commonly referred to as Jabodetabek. \n ", "6 \ndevelopment effectiveness and environment and social performance, including the development \nindicators specified in the GAP agreed by ADB and the borrower. \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB Assistance \n \n20.  Support small and medium-sized enterprises\u2019 growth. ADB\u2019s funding will support the \ngrowth of Indosurya\u2019s SME loan portfolio, including its women SME financing portfolio. Some of \nthe funding will also target geographic areas where access to finance is more limited, such as \noutside Greater Jakarta. Gender support initiatives will be implemented through the GAP. \n \n21.  Provide longer tenor debt. Indosurya has relied on local commercial banks for funding, \nmostly at shorter tenors, and capital market issuances of medium-term notes. To finance its longer \ntenor SME portfolio, Indosurya has sought matching financing, which is challenging for smaller \nMFCs in Indonesia. In addition to longer-term financing, ADB\u2019s TA will help Indosurya strengthen \nits liquidity and longer-term funding management. \n \n22.  Catalyze private sector financing. If ADB\u2019s A loan, or part of it, is denominated in US \ndollars, the B loan of up to $50 million will catalyze private sector capital and diversify Indosurya\u2019s \nlender base. \n \nD.

The project will support financial inclusion through expanded access to finance \nby SME clients in Indonesia, especially focusing on women borrowers and borrowers in areas \noutside Greater Jakarta. The project is aligned with the government\u2019s National Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan, 2015\u20132019, which seeks to promote financial inclusion.34 \n \n24.  Outcome. The project\u2019s outcome will improve sustainable SME lending activities. \n \n25.  Outputs. The outputs are increased lending capacity of Indosurya, in particular for women \nSMEs, and improved gender equity of Indosurya. \n \nB.  Alignment with ADB Strategy and Operations \n \n26.  Consistency with ADB strategy and country strategy. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Strategy 2030,35 especially its operational priorities of (i) addressing remaining poverty and \nreducing inequalities by facilitating quality job creation through SMEs, and (ii) accelerating \nprogress in gender equality by narrowing the gender gap through economic empowerment \nthrough better access to finance for women SMEs. The project is also consistent with ADB\u2019s \ncountry partnership strategy for Indonesia, 2016\u20132019, which aims to support Indonesia by \nfostering higher and more inclusive growth, including by expanding access to financing to SMEs \n \n34 Government of Indonesia. 2016.

POLICY COMPLIANCE \n \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n \n27.  ADB  has  categorized  the  investment  in  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (2009).39 \n28.  This transaction is classified as category FI for impacts on the environment and FI treated \nas C for involuntary resettlement and indigenous peoples. ADB conducted due diligence to assess \nthe potential environmental and social impacts and risks associated with Indosurya's existing and \nfuture  portfolio,  and  its  capacity  to  implement  an  appropriate  environmental  and  social \nmanagement system (ESMS). The multipurpose loans are only used for consumer or personal \nuse (e.g., vehicle loans) are considered to have no environmental or social impacts. Most of the \nloan portfolio consists of investment loans and working capital loans. These are used for various \nbusiness  sectors  including  trading,  hotel,  and  restaurant;  business  services;  construction; \nindustrial; and freight, warehousing, and communications. Since the project involves the financing \nof SMEs with ADB proceeds, it will have very limited direct climate change impact. Sample \nsubprojects in the hotel, construction, and industry sectors were visited as part of the due \ndiligence. The subloans for these subcompanies were provided at a time when Indosurya had no \nformal environmental and social management procedures. The subcompanies comply with the \nregulatory environmental requirements in Indonesia. Indosurya will screen its future subprojects \nfor  all  potential  environmental,  health  and  safety,  involuntary  resettlement,  and  indigenous \npeoples impacts and risks; and will require subborrowers to implement mitigation measures or \nprepare corrective action plans, as appropriate. \n \n29.  Indosurya  is  finalizing  its  ESMS,  which  it  initiated  when  the  German  Investment \nCorporation  (DEG)  provided  its  loan  to  Indosurya  in  2017.  ESMS  implementation  is  the \nresponsibility of Indosurya\u2019s Risk Management and Information System Department and the \ndirector of risk and information technology is concurrently assigned as the ESMS officer. As part \nof its organizational strengthening, Indosurya has committed to hire additional ESMS staff and \nengage a senior environmental and social consultant with the requisite background as it expands \nits business and geographic coverage. DEG, through its ESMS consultant, provided training on \nthe ESMS to Indosurya to strengthen the capacity of relevant staff to undertake environmental \nand social safeguards screening, categorization, and monitoring. Before disbursement of ADB\u2019s \nfinancing, the company will enhance the draft ESMS to harmonize the ESMS requirements of \nDEG and IFC with those of ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement.40 The ESMS will ensure that \nIndosurya will not use ADB funding to finance projects classified category A for environmental \n \n36 ADB.  2016.
