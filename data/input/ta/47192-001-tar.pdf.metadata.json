The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has promoted electronic government procurement \n(e-GP) as a key component of procurement reforms in developing member countries (DMCs). \nADB\u2019s  involvement  in  promoting  e-GP  acknowledges  its  potential  to  enhance  procurement \ntransparency  and  provide  wider  access  to  information  and  markets.  Moreover,  through \nleveraging technology, e-GP offers opportunities to innovate and streamline public procurement \nfor  greater  efficiency  and  economy.  e-GP  can  also  contribute  to  improved  governance, \nparticularly when aligned with initiatives in budgeting, taxation, and audit. ADB is a founding \nmember of the Multilateral Development Banks Electronic Government Procurement (MDB-\nEGP) working group that coordinates conferences, workshops, research, and support of e-\nprocurement initiatives. The MDB-EGP working group developed an e-GP toolkit in 2003\u20132005, \nand has hosted a series of conferences on e-GP bi-annually. The Asia Pacific Procurement \nPartnership Initiative1 has supported a variety of e-GP initiatives\u2014including an e-GP survey; \nupdate of the e-GP toolkit; case studies of e-GP implementation in selected DMCs (Armenia, \nthe People\u2019s Republic of China, India, and the Philippines); and hosting of the 2011 Asia Pacific \nElectronic Government Procurement conference in Denpasar, Indonesia \n2.  . As a follow-up to the e-GP conference in Denpasar, the Republic of Korea and ADB \norganized a Public Procurement Service Workshop on e-Procurement and Cooperation, with \nparticipants  from  Indonesia,  Mongolia,  Turkey,  Uzbekistan,  and  Viet  Nam  to  (i)  share \nexperiences, benefits, challenges, and main concerns in implementing e-procurement in the \npublic sector; (ii) identify potential areas of cooperation at the bilateral and regional level; and \n(iii) enhance e-procurement collaboration through a regional cooperative network. The concept \nof  establishing  an  Asia  Pacific  procurement  network  was  supported  by  all  country \nrepresentatives present at the workshop. It appears that while e-GP is one of the major topics of \npotential cooperation, wider public procurement networking and cooperation in areas of public \nprocurement reform is more warranted. The workshop participants also stressed the role ADB \nplays  in  facilitating  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  The  workshop  concluded  that \nestablishment of the network is necessary to foster formal and informal cooperation within \ninstitutions and individuals in Asia and the Pacific at the national level, which are responsible for \npublic procurement regulation, management, and reform.  Concept clearance for the TA was \nobtained from the Office of the Vice-President, Administration and Corporate Management on \n24 June 2013. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. 2 \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  For many DMCs in the region and around the world, e-GP has become one of the main \ne-government initiatives, as governments look to improve their procurement through a more \nopen, competitive, and transparent environment; and to support reforms to address corruption. \nE-procurement  continues  to  prove  to  be  a  viable  alternative  to  manual  procurement \nprocesses\u2014bringing cost savings, time and process efficiencies, and transparency. For many \ngovernments,  the  introduction  of  e-procurement  reflects  a  significant  change  to  business \npractices, many of which do not possess the range of skill sets required to support and manage \na  new  business  environment.  Countries  in  the  region  have  followed  different  approaches, \nfunctionalities, and business models for the implementation of e-GP\u2014from user pays systems \nto government-funded systems and support for bid submission, and use of online catalogues. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for the Asia Pacific Procurement Partnership Initiative. Manila (TA 7437-REG, \napproved on 11 December 2009). \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities sections of ADB\u2019s website on 24 October 2013. \n ", "2   \nThe  various  solutions  and  business  models  available  for  e-procurement  give  governments \nmultiple options and questions to consider when developing a strategy to meet their needs and \noperate within their specific environment. While producing knowledge solutions (such as the e-\nGP tool kit and e-GP handbook are  beneficial for DMCs, face-to-face and online collaboration \nof public procurement professionals involved in e-GP implementation has substantial potential \nas part of wider procurement reforms. The need for such collaboration was stressed by the \nadministrator  of  the  Republic  of  Korea  Public  Procurement  Service  and  seconded  by  the \nmajority  of  participants  at  the  Denpasar  conference.  Asia  and  the  Pacific  is  missing  an \nopportunity to realize synergies of regional cooperation and integration, especially in view of \nsimilar initiatives in other parts of the world such as the Pan-European Public Procurement \nOnline.3 The  EU  PPN4 is  spearheading  procurement  collaboration  in  Europe.  The  Inter-\nAmerican Network on Government Procurement (INGP) focuses on procurement collaboration \nin Latin America and the Caribbean.5 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n4.  The technical assistance (TA) will build the capacity of DMCs in Asia and the Pacific in \nimplementing e-GP and enhance the transparency of public procurement tenders. It will target \nall DMCs in the region and open membership to non-DMCs that wish to share their experience \nin implementing e-GP. Possible coordination and collaboration with the INGP will be considered. \nThe  TA  will  explore  opportunities  for  continuous  self-funding  of  the  Asia  Pacific  Public \nProcurement Network through contributions of member countries.  \n5.  The impact of the TA will be that a significant number of participating ADB DMCs will \ndevelop e-GP systems based on international best practices. The outcome will be strengthened \ncapacity of public procurement agencies to implement e-GP solutions based on international \nbest practice. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n6.   The  TA  will  have  seven  outputs:  (i)  electronic  publication  of  an  e-GP  handbook, \n(ii) reports on comparative analysis of e-GP platforms and their suitability for cross-border trade, \n(iii) operationalizing a web forum of public procurement professionals, (iv) an interactive wiki of \n                                                \n3   Pan-European Public Procurement Online (PEPPOL). http://www.peppol.eu/  \n4   The EU PPN is an informal European-wide cooperation network in public procurement, established on 31 January \n2003 in Copenhagen. The objectives of the network are to strengthen the application and enforcement of \nprocurement rules through mutual exchange of experience and benchmarking, and to create reliable and effective \ninformal  cooperation  including  problem  solving  in  cross-border  cases  related  to  public  procurement.  Full \nmembership in the EU PPN is open to all EU member states. Associate membership is open to countries of the \nEuropean Economic Area, accessing countries, and candidate countries committed to applying the EU rules. Other \ncountries and state-based organizations operating at the European level can be invited to participate in the EU \nPPN, when appropriate. The European Commission has the status of observer and supports the activities of the \nEU  PPN.  Public  Procurement  Network.  Rules  of  operation.  http://www.publicprocurementnetwork.org/ \nindex.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=58&Itemid=57 \n5  The Inter-American Network on Government Procurement (INGP), is an initiative of the American countries \nconstituted as a regional technical cooperation mechanism, composed by governmental institutions, headed by the \nnational directors, who have the highest responsibility regarding the regulation, management, and modernization of \ngovernment procurement in the 32 countries of Latin America and the Caribbean. http://www.ricg.org/what-is-the-\ningp/content/3/en/ \n ", "                                                                                                          3                                   \ne-GP guidance notes, (v) annual e-GP meetings, (vi) technical working group meetings and (vii)  \npilot testing of \u201csoftware as service\u201d 6applicability for e-GP in small countries. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n7.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,400,000, of which (i) $900,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V); and (ii) $500,000 will be financed \non  a  grant  basis  by  the  Republic  of  Korea  e-Asia  and  Knowledge  Partnership  Fund  and \nadministered by ADB. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n8.  The TA will be implemented from November 2013 to October 2017. ADB will be the \nexecuting agency, and the Operations Services and Financial Management Department will act \nas focal department during implementation and run a joint secretariat with the Republic of Korea \nPublic Procurement Service, to be based in Manila. The secretariat will be staffed by a part-time \ninternational  consultant  with  proven  technical  expertise  in  e-GP;  a  part-time,  intermittent \nlogistics consultant; and a part-time website or forum administrator. The secretariat will prepare \nannual work plans for the network and coordinate all its formal and informal activities (web \nforums, wiki). The network is likely to have formal and informal (affiliate) membership categories. \nThe target membership of the formal network will include civil servants from ADB member \ncountries who are primarily responsible for policy formulation and implementation related to e-\nGP solutions, including those with cross-border trade facilities. The members will need to be \nendorsed to the network by the government department or ministry primarily responsible for \noversight  of  public  procurement.  Sponsorship  of  meetings  and  conference  attendance  of \nparticipants from non-graduated DMCs will be considered primarily for members of the formal \nnetwork. Graduated DMCs and development partners are expected to self-fund participation in \nthe network activities. Affiliate membership will be open to e-GP professionals and will likely \ninclude access to information and knowledge solutions available at the network website and \nforum. \n \n9.  Network activities are envisaged to involve several technical level subgroups: (i) legal \nand regulatory; (ii) technical design and configuration; (iii) change management and public \ncommunications plan; and (iv) government procurement, World Trade Organization government \nprocurement agreements (WTO GPAs), bilateral trade agreements, and implications for e-GP \ndesign and implementation.  \n \n10.  TA implementation will be coordinated with other ongoing ADB initiatives promoting      \ne-procurement,  in  particular  with  the  information  and  communication  technology  and  e-\ngovernance  team  of  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development  Department  and  regional \ndepartments implementing e-GP.7   \n \n11.  The TA will initially require the services of three individually recruited consultants (lead \ntechnical consultant and e-government procurement expert, project analyst and information \ntechnology  consultant,  and  logistics  consultant).  Other  short-term  consultants  or  resource \npersons  and  researchers  will  be  recruited  during  implementation  based  on  demands  and \n                                                \n6  Software  as  a  service (SaaS) is  a software delivery  model in  which  software  and  associated data are \ncentrally hosted on the cloud. SaaS is typically accessed by users  via a web browser. \n7  ADB. 2012. Technical Assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for Implementing the e-Procurement System.

The outline terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. Procurement of software as service and equipment will follow ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). Licenses acquired during TA implementation \nfor software as service will be assigned to participating DMCs by specifying the right of the third \nparties in the service contracts. TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with the Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time), and equipment \nprocured under the TA will be disposed of in accordance with the handbook.   \n \n12.  The TA will be monitored and evaluated through regular surveys of participating DMCs \n(results of the survey conducted in 20118 will serve as a baseline indicator). Good practices and \nlessons learned will be disseminated primarily through annual meetings, learning events, and \npublications. Additional publicity will be generated through web updates of the e-GP Facebook \naccount and press releases to printed and electronic media.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n13.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia Knowledge and Partnership Fund; \nand (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 on a grant basis \nfor Asia Pacific Public Electronic Procurement Network, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard.  \n                                                \n8  ADB 2011.
