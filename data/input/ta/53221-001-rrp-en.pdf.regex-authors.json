THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nprogrammatic approach for the Third Capital Market Development Program,1 and (ii) proposed \npolicy-based loans to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for subprogram 1 of the Third Capital \nMarket Development Program. The report also describes proposed technical assistance (TA) for \nSupporting the Third Capital Market Development Program, and if the Board approves the \nproposed loans, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve the TA. \n \n2.   The proposed program will support demand- and supply-side measures to broaden and \ndeepen the financial system in Pakistan and ground it in a strong legal and regulatory framework \nin line with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 and \ncountry operations business plan, 2020\u20132022 for Pakistan.2 It also fits in the framework of the \n$6 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program approved on \n3 July 2019 to facilitate improved macroeconomic management.3 The EFF program includes \nrecommendations relating to finance sector reforms that focus on deepening access to finance, \nimplementing a sound debt management strategy, and supporting private sector development. \nThe proposed program contributes to EFF implementation and sustainability since it develops \nalternative sources of access to finance (i.e., capital markets), supports sound debt management \nthrough government bond market development, and facilitates private sector investment by \nmobilizing financial resources. The program, structured as two subprograms, will facilitate the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  necessary  reforms  to  create  an  enabling  environment  for \ncompetitive  capital markets. The programmatic approach will chronologically sequence the \nreforms in a multiyear framework (2019\u20132022) and provide for flexibility to incorporate changes \nwhere warranted. Even with the country\u2019s evolving economic situation, the program\u2019s design is \nrobust because of its emphasis on the capital market enabling environment. Programmatic budget \nsupport will finance two subprograms, each designated as a fully front-loaded, single-tranche \nintervention to be implemented during 2019\u20132022. The attached TA will assist in implementing \nthe program. \n \nII.  PROGRAM AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Background and Development Constraints \n \n3.  A central objective of the government\u2019s economic development strategy, as reflected in \nVision 2025,4 is to elevate Pakistan\u2019s status from a lower middle-income country to an upper \nmiddle-income one by 2025. The government has targeted the generation of job opportunities \nand enhanced income levels as top priorities. Achieving the objective of Vision 2025 will require \nsubstantial private and public investments to accelerate economic growth. Economic growth has \nbeen largely driven by public and private consumption, with very low levels of domestic savings \nand investment. At 15% of gross domestic product (GDP), Pakistan\u2019s investment rate in 2020 is \nalmost half of the South Asian average of 30% of GDP. Crowding out of private investment also \noccurs because of excessive government borrowing from banks to finance the deficit. Private \n \n1  The program was initially called the Financial Markets Development Program. \n2  ADB. 2015. Country Partnership Strategy: Pakistan, 2015\u20132019. Manila; and ADB. 2019.

Similarly, the domestic savings rate declined from 17.4% of \nGDP in 1990 to 5.2% of GDP in 2020; this is significantly lower than the rate of its regional peers \nin 2020: 28.0% in India, 25.0% in Bangladesh%, and 21.0% in Sri Lanka.5 Underdeveloped capital \nmarkets have contributed to the ineffective mobilization of savings. Consequently, the savings \ngap has led to a persistently high fiscal deficit that makes the economy dependent on volatile \nforeign capital. \n \n4.  Pakistan\u2019s vulnerability may increase as the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) decelerated \neconomic growth to \u20130.38% in fiscal year (FY) 20206 and inflows from exports and remittances \nwere adversely impacted. Market capitalization as a percentage of GDP at the Pakistan Stock \nExchange (PSX) declined from 16% of GDP on 1 March 2020 to 15% as of mid-August 2020. A \nsteeper decline at the PSX has been prevented by a series of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) policy \nrate cuts since mid-March 2020 that lowered the policy rate by 6.25% to 7.00% and the borrowing \ncosts for firms. At the same time, Pakistan\u2019s access to global financial markets has become more \nexpensive because of an increase in the credit default spread since February 2020.7 As a result, \ndeveloping robust and competitive domestic capital markets is even more critical and is an \nindispensable tool for mobilizing private investment and minimizing such external shocks. The \nprogram will aid the COVID-19 recovery phase through subprogram 1 reforms, such as enhanced \naccess to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) through a dedicated capital \nmarket platform and mobilization of savings by onboarding new retail investors through simplified \nknow-your-customer (KYC) procedures with biometric verification. The government has become \nincreasingly aware of the need to institute appropriate reforms so that the capital markets can \nenhance intermediate savings and investments to drive sustainable economic growth. \n \n5.  ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 prioritizes developing the finance sector and capital markets to \nsupport sustainable economic development by creating an enabling environment for private \ninvestment.8 The program will not only support private sector expansion but also contribute to the \noperational priorities of (i) strengthening governance and institutional capacity through specific \ninstitutional strengthening reforms and (ii) accelerating progress in gender equality through \nreforms that enhance the participation of female investors. Facilitation of private sector investment \nwas part of the country partnership strategy, 2015\u20132019 and is also a key area under the country \npartnership strategy, 2020\u20132024 (footnote 2). \n \n6.  Predominantly bank-based finance sector.9 Pakistan\u2019s finance sector is predominantly \na bank-based system that does not effectively play its intermediation role. As of April 2020, bank \nassets  accounted  for  almost  70%  of  the  country\u2019s  total  financial  assets,  national  saving \ninstruments and government bonds accounted for 25% of total financial assets, and the equity \nmarket contributed less than 5%. In comparison, bank assets accounted for 62% of GDP in \nBangladesh, 81% in India, and 70% in Sri Lanka, while equity market assets accounted for 12% \nof GDP in Bangladesh, 14% in India, and 22% in Sri Lanka. Banks in Pakistan mainly offer short \nmaturity  loans  and  are not  in  a strong  prudential  position  to  offer  long-term  financing  for \ninfrastructure projects. \n \n \n5  World Bank.

The credit default spread on Pakistan 10-year euro bond has increased to 5.79% in August \n2020 from 3.53% in January 2020, after peaking at 8.30% in April 2020 (accessed on 14 August 2020).  \n8  ADB. 2018.

Underdeveloped capital markets. Pakistan\u2019s capital markets play a limited role in \nfinancial intermediation and resource mobilization. The PSX lacks depth in terms of the number \nof investors and the number of companies raising capital. Fewer than 250,000 individual investors \n(less than 0.1% of the population) have a stock investing account. The absence of a centralized \nKYC procedure and cumbersome customer onboarding requirements impede the participation of \nnew investors in the capital markets. During 2015\u20132019, only 25 companies raised capital at the \nPSX, while private equity and venture capital capital-raising activity was four times higher. Market \ncapitalization of the PSX accounted for only about 13% of the country\u2019s GDP in mid-April 2020, \nregressing from 30% of GDP in May 2017. With 543 listed companies and $42 billion market \ncapitalization, the PSX is below most of its regional peers in terms of market capitalization as a \npercentage of GDP (12% in Bangladesh, 21% in Sri Lanka, and 41% in India) in 2020. On \naverage, 2.7 brokerage firms have defaulted per year since 2000, which adversely impacted \nmarket confidence. Rules to be listed on the PSX main board and the SME board, which was \ncreated to encourage start-ups, are restrictive. In addition, the SME board requires companies to \nhave a 5-year history and be profitable for more than 2 years. As a result, no company has listed \non the PSX\u2019s SME board despite the country\u2019s growing technology start-up ecosystem. The depth \nand breadth of the capital markets have also been restricted since many state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs) have not been listed on the PSX. As a result, SOEs also miss out on the benefits from \nefficiency improvements through the discipline of stock market listing. Sophisticated products \nsuch as options and derivatives are not available in the capital markets. \n \n8.  Constrained bond market development. Pakistan\u2019s bond market (34% of GDP as of \nApril 2020) is almost completely dominated by government borrowing. The government bond \nmarket is primarily short dated with an average debt maturity of 1.7 years. It does not fulfill its role \nas a benchmark pricing reference because of ad hoc government debt management practices \narising from the absence of a professional debt management office (DMO). The operating \nframework of the government bond market system does not promote competitive bidding. \nAuctioning of government securities is not based on market prices and hampers the formulation \nof a credible government yield curve and a liquid bond market. Although auctions are conducted \nbased on a preannounced auction calendar, the government decides the cut-off yield for the debt \nrather than accepting a market-determined yield for the announced volume. When the market \nasks for a price higher than what the government is willing to offer, the bids are frequently rejected. \nThe price-driven approach has deep implications for Pakistan\u2019s capital markets. It has restricted \nthe volume and liquidity of longer-tenor government bonds, and yields do not then reflect true \nmarket conditions, which hinders the process of establishing a credible benchmark for medium- \nto long-term financing rates. This undermines the credibility of the primary market, as does the \nrejection of auction bids. The government bond market also does not offer sovereign sukuks \n(Islamic bonds) to cater to the liquidity management requirements of Islamic banks. \n \n9.  The nascent corporate bond market accounted for 2.2% of GDP as of April 2020 compared \nwith 1.0% in Bangladesh, 1.0% in Sri Lanka, and 16.0% in India. The absence of an effective \ngovernment bond market yield curve impedes the appropriate pricing of corporate bonds, and \ncorporate bond issuances are therefore less attractive to issuers and investors. Tax distortions, \nsuch as a complex and uneven tax regime that disadvantages nonresident companies from \ninvesting in bonds, hinder bond market activity. On the demand side, major institutional investors \n(such as pension funds and insurance companies) have a limited role in financing government \nbonds and corporate bonds since these investors prefer National Savings Scheme instruments.10 \n \n10 National Savings Scheme instruments, administered by the Central Directorate of National Savings, are attractive \nsince these instruments are government backed and offer higher returns than equivalent money market instruments, \n \n ", "4 \nThe  participation  of  investors  across  the  maturity  spectrum  is  critical  to  support  market \ndevelopment. A diverse investor base also lowers the debt cost and volatility in market yields. \n \n10.  Limited coordination between the regulators. Reform opportunities begin with the \nregulators: the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the SBP, and the DMO \nat the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The SECP acts as the company registrar and apex regulator \nfor nonbank financial markets, including capital markets. The SBP, the central bank, regulates \nthe banking industry. The DMO handles debt management at the MOF. A national strategic plan \nfor capital market development is absent and an institutionalized forum for key agencies to \ncoordinate their efforts does not exist. Financial stability is compromised because of limited policy \ncoordination and joint supervision of the financial system by the key regulators. Gaps persist \nbetween regulators and risks may build across the financial system with no overarching oversight. \n \n11.  Persistent weakness in governance structures. The SECP\u2019s operational and financial \nefficiency is constrained in terms of the unclear appointment process, siloed operations where \ncommissioners are responsible only for their designated areas rather than acting as a collegiate \nbody, and limited clarity in the policy board\u2019s role. The SECP\u2019s market surveillance system needs \nto be upgraded to ensure effective market monitoring. Its enforcement effectiveness is also \nchallenged by the absence of a dedicated capital market tribunal. The court system does not have \nthe competence to deliberate on securities cases, and the pace of resolving securities cases \npending in the court system is also slow. \n \n12.  Similarly, the DMO under the MOF faces structural capacity issues and does not function \nas a properly empowered treasury operation that develops and implements a consolidated \nadministrative framework for debt management. The DMO merely collates information and acts \nas a conduit to government securities auctions. All decisions on terms, tenor, and structure of \ndebt are made on a fragmented basis across the MOF. The DMO also does not possess a \ncentralized database for effective cash management and planning. This exposes the government \nto a risk of default in the case of any volatility in demand in the auctions for government bonds.11 \n \n13.  In addition, the ability of the country\u2019s Audit Oversight Board (AOB), which critically \noversees audit firm quality in Pakistan and therefore contributes to market transparency, to \neffectively regulate the auditing profession is constrained in terms of its board composition \neligibility criteria, its regulatory powers, and having a stable funding source. The AOB has weak \neligibility criteria for former audit practitioners to serve as members of the AOB governing body, it \nlacks a legal mandate to conduct direct inspections of audit firms unconditionally, and it lacks a \nstable  source  of  funding  from  the  government  to  effectively  execute  its  powers  and \nresponsibilities. Shareholders and investors rely on audited financial statements of companies to \nmake informed decisions and therefore trust that only an audit firm with a satisfactory quality \nrating can review companies\u2019 financial statements.  \n \n14.  Program anchor. To address these constraints, the government and ADB have agreed \nto anchor the program to the design of a long-term national capital market master plan. The \n \nand can be redeemed any time without redemption charges, whereas selling instruments with comparable yields \ninvolve such charges. \n11 The World Bank is focusing on organizational restructuring at the MOF, including integration of various functions \nand/or responsibilities from the other MOF wings into the DMO as well as the DMO\u2019s debt reporting under the $500 \nmillion Resilient Institutions for Sustainable Economy (RISE) Program development policy financing that was \napproved in June 2020. This program builds on those foundations by developing the government bond market \nthrough the realization of a market-based government bond market yield curve based on a strategy of creating liquid \nbenchmark bond issues. \n ", "5 \nformulation of this master plan during 2019\u20132020 is supported by subprogram 1. Approval of the \ncapital market master plan is included as a crucial subprogram 1 policy action under the program \nto build strong government ownership and coordination across the agencies. \n \nB.  Policy Reform and ADB\u2019s Value Addition \n \n15.  ADB  has  been  engaging  with  Pakistan  since  the  1990s  and  has  been  the  lead \ndevelopment partner in the capital markets area. ADB  has supported the development of \nPakistan\u2019s financial markets through three initiatives over the past two decades. From 1997 to \n2002, support was mainly provided through a $250 million policy-based loan for the Capital Market \nDevelopment Program to support the adoption of fundamental reforms.12 This program primarily \ncontributed to the establishment of the SECP and the transition to a new regulatory regime. From \n2002 to 2007, support was provided through a $260 million policy-based loan for the Financial \n(Nonbank) Markets and Governance Program.13 The objective was to strengthen the pension, \ninsurance, and savings systems, as well as strengthen the SECP\u2019s regulatory regime in the \nnonbank  subsector. From  2007 to 2011, a $400 million policy-based loan  for the Second \nGeneration of Capital Market Reform Program primarily supported developing an enabling \nenvironment for voluntary private pensions, adopting a professional certification regime, and \nimplementing a self-regulatory organization model at the stock exchanges.14 Since 2011, ADB \nhas continued engagement in the finance sector through a public sector enterprises reform \nprogram; the development of inclusive insurance markets in micro, small, and medium-sized \nenterprises; and disaster risk financing.15 \n \n16.  The Capital Market Development Program was successfully implemented with concrete \nresults; subsequent financial markets program and the second generation program mentioned \nabove were partly successful. The proposed program will build on lessons from the Independent \nEvaluation Department\u2019s special evaluation study and the completion reports of the three previous \nprograms. The program\u2019s effectiveness will be facilitated by (i) a limited number of impactful policy \nactions to monitor program compliance effectively (previous programs had too many actions and \ntoo broad a focus); (ii) comprehensive consultation with stakeholders through national workshops \nto diagnose the issues effectively, leading to adoption of relevant policies and thereby creating \nownership;16 and (iii) formulation of the long-term national capital market master plan to ensure \nsustainability of reforms, and embed the plan within a broader government-owned long-term \ndevelopment strategy, serving as an anchor for the program.17 The program (i) pursues a focused \n \n12 ADB. 1997.

The program builds on ADB\u2019s previous capital and financial market programs to introduce \nreform measures that deepen and broaden Pakistan\u2019s capital markets by (i) developing the \ngovernment yield curve and thereby promoting a more liquid government bond market through \nthe  institutional  strengthening  of  the  DMO;  (ii)  enhancing  institutional  investor  demand  by \nbroadening, deepening, and diversifying the investor base; (iii) strengthening the institutional and \nregulatory capacity of the SECP, the DMO, and the AOB; (iv) developing important market \ninfrastructure, such as surveillance systems and a trading system for bonds; and (v) enhancing \nthe supply of alternative financial instruments, such as derivatives. Government consultations \nidentified the reform areas discussed in paras. 18\u201320. The policy matrix is in Appendix 4. \n \n18.  Market stability strengthened. The reforms will promote more robust, resilient, and \nstable capital markets through subprogram 1 actions, such as amending the Securities and \nExchange Commission of Pakistan Act, 1997 to ensure structural changes in the appointment \nprocess, and commissioning operations as a collegiate body. The establishment of the National \nFinance Stability Council comprising the SBP governor, the SECP chair, and the finance minister \n(or adviser on finance and revenue)  will improve interagency policy coordination and play an \ninstrumental  role  in  dealing  with systemic  issues  that cut  across  regulatory domains.  The \nintroduction of a new broker model will strengthen the brokerage industry by reducing broker \ndefaults. The new model will categorize brokers according to their net worth and governance \nrequirements, which will ascertain appropriate operational risks to be assumed by the brokers. \nSubprogram 2 actions include exempting income tax for SECP, implementing the broker model \nand replacing legacy leverage instruments with derivatives. \n \n19.  Market facilitation enhanced. Reforms in this area will support more efficient resource \nmobilization and allocation in the economy by expediting the adjudication of enforcement actions \nand strengthening auditing standards. Expedited adjudication will complement the enhanced \nenforcement capacity at the SECP by establishing a special tribunal for capital-market-related \ncases in subprogram 1 as part of the judicial system overseen by a tribunal chair and its members. \nSubprogram 1 actions include developing  an adequately funded  AOB with a strengthened \nregulatory and operational mandate based on the adoption of international auditing standards, \nwhich will strengthen compliance, enhance market confidence, and allow for informed investment \ndecisions. The formulation of a long-term national capital market master plan will ensure that the \nprogram is an integral part of a government-owned long-term development strategy. Subprogram \n2 actions include making the special tribunal operational and installing an upgraded electronic \nmarket surveillance system at the SECP. \n \n20.  The supply and demand of securities enhanced. This will involve supply measures in \nsubprogram 1 to (i) promote alternative financial instruments through in-principle approval from \nthe federal government for passage by Parliament of a netting bill to be implemented by the SECP \nand SBP that will reduce counterparty risk and the subsequent introduction of derivatives to \ndevelop a deeper and broader capital market, (ii) revitalize a separate PSX board for SMEs with \nreduced listing requirements and costs, and (iii) gain Cabinet approval for a streamlined taxation \nregime for nonresident companies investing in debt securities.

Demand measures in subprogram 1 include (i) onboarding new retail \ninvestors through simplified KYC procedures with biometric verification, (ii) introducing volume-\nbased auctions with variance limits to develop a credible government yield curve, (iii) approving \na DMO staffing plan to strengthen debt management proficiency, and (iv) developing an SECP \npolicy on gender mainstreaming that will raise demand for securities through the increased \nparticipation of female investors since women\u2019s participation in Pakistan\u2019s capital markets is very \nlow. Demand measures in subprogram 2 will (i) put the DMO staffing plan into operation, (ii) \neliminate institutional investors from participating in the National Savings Scheme to promote \ncontractual savings institutions and pension fund demand in the capital markets, (iii) implement a \nbuyback of fragmented issues and replace them with liquid benchmark issues to create liquidity \nin the government bond market keeping in view cost risk trade off, and (iv) issue women \nentrepreneur bonds whose proceeds will facilitate the financing of SMEs owned or led by women. \n \n21.  ADB\u2019s value addition. ADB is regarded by the government, market participants, and \ndevelopment partners as a credible party that will ensure a balanced and professional approach \ndevoid of short-term interest and political interference. ADB offers an integrated approach that \ncombines professional and impartial policy advice with financial support for adjustment, effective \nimplementation support, and capacity development through TA to ensure sustainability. Not many \ndevelopment partners have the same level of credibility, or the means or capacity to offer this \nsolutions-based approach that can effectively tailor these best practices to the needs and \nconditions of Pakistan\u2019s capital markets by also applying ADB\u2019s knowledge in similar programs \nacross the region. Without ADB involvement in capital market reforms, and given the complexities \ninvolved and the resources and expertise required, such reforms would not have progressed \nsuccessfully. \n \n22.  Development coordination. These reforms complement other initiatives, such as the \nWorld  Bank\u2019s  $500  million  Resilient  Institutions  for  Sustainable  Economy  (RISE)  Program \ndevelopment  policy  financing  that  was  approved  in  June  2020,  and  the  Department  for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom\u2019s $10 million SECP Digitalization Project. The \nRISE Program will develop a legal framework for debt management, while the Department for \nInternational  Development  project  focuses  on  strengthening  the  SECP\u2019s  information  and \ncommunication technology systems. The IMF\u2019s $6 billion EFF program approved on 3 July 2019 \nfacilitates improved macroeconomic management, including through sound debt management. \nThe program builds on the legal and institutional foundations of sound debt management under \nthe  RISE  Program  and  the  EFF  by  developing  the  government  bond  market  through  the \nrealization of a market-based government bond market yield curve. To ensure synergies and \ncomplementarity, ADB is closely coordinating with the IMF and other development partners. \n \nC.  Impacts of the Reform \n \n23.  The program is aligned with the following overarching development objective: capital \nmarkets act as a major catalyst in transforming the economy into a more efficient, innovative, and \ncompetitive marketplace within the global arena (footnote 4). The development of capital markets \nwill  contribute  toward  achieving  this  objective  by  stimulating  competition  with  the  banking \nsubsector that will lead to greater efficiencies and innovation. The program will have the following \nreform effect: the capacity and size of the capital markets are augmented. The program is \nstructured around four reform areas: (i) market stability strengthened, (ii) market facilitation \nenhanced, (iii) supply measures enhanced, and (iv) demand measures enhanced. Subprogram 1 \n ", "8 \nreforms focus on strengthening the institutional and regulatory capacity of the SECP, the DMO, \nand the AOB, while subprogram 2 will catalyze institutional investor demand and increase the \nsupply of alternative financial instruments, such as derivatives. The proposed reforms conform to \nbest practices, including those promulgated by the International Organization of Securities \nCommissions. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs and Budget Support \n \n24.  Based on the development financing requirements of the program, ADB will provide policy-\nbased loans totaling $600 million to finance two subprograms under the programmatic approach. \nThe government has requested a concessional loan of $290.204 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; an annual interest rate of 2% per year; and such other terms and \nconditions set forth in the draft loan agreement. The government has also requested a regular \nloan of $9.796 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to help finance subprogram 1. The \nloan will have a 15-year term, including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions as set forth \nin the draft loan agreement. Based on the straight-line method, the average loan maturity is 9.25 \nyears, and there is no maturity premium payable to ADB. The development policy letter is in \nAppendix 3. \n \n25.  Pakistan\u2019s development financing needs. The government\u2019s financing requirements \nare expected to be $78.79 billion in FY2021, to be financed by domestic and foreign sources \n(Table 1). The government\u2019s foreign borrowing will be $15.15 billion in FY2021, mainly from \ninternational financial institutions and bilateral partners. \n \nTable 1: Financing Needs and Support for FY2021 \n($ million) \nItem    FY2021 \nGross financing requirement    78,788 \nGross domestic financing    63,636 \nGross foreign financinga    15,152 \n  ADB\u2019s originally programmed and new policy-based loans    900 \nThird Capital Market Development Program    300 \nTrade and Competitiveness Program    300 \nEnergy Sector Reform Program    300 \n  World Bankb    1,617 \n  IMFc    1,279 \n  Others (including bilateral partners, IDB, AIIB, euro bond)d    11,356 \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AIIB = Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, EFF = Extended Fund Facility, FY = \nfiscal year, IDB = Islamic Development Bank, IMF = International Monetary Fund. \na  The amount includes policy-based lending operations. \nb  The World Bank will provide three development policy operations during FY2021. \nc  The IMF EFF loan disbursements are expected to continue during FY2021. \nd  This comprises a $0.500 billion loan from the AIIB, a $1.000 billion loan from the IDB, a $1.000 billion loan from Saudi \nArabia, $1.500 billion from a euro bond issuance, $3.922 billion from commercial banks, and $3.434 billion from \nbilateral partners (People\u2019s Republic of China, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates). \nSource: Government of Pakistan (Ministry of Finance), IMF, and ADB estimates. \n \n26.  Debt sustainability. ADB\u2019s debt sustainability analysis concluded that the total public \ndebt\u2013GDP ratio will reach 83.0% in FY2021 compared with 82.9% in FY2020 and 76.7% in \nFY2019. However, this ratio is expected to decline after FY2021 and stabilize at 72.6% by \n ", "9 \nFY2024. External debt risks remain high, but the economy is expected to gradually recover in \nFY2021, and external debt is projected to steadily decline and return to a more sustainable path \ndriven primarily by a lower current account deficit, non-debt-creating capital inflows, and higher \neconomic growth in subsequent years. More importantly, the availability of adequate concessional \nfinancing from ADB will provide much-needed fiscal resources and allow the government to \nprioritize its development expenditure on productive investments. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n27.  The executing agency will be the MOF. The implementing agencies will be the SBP and \nthe SECP. A program steering committee has been established to oversee and coordinate \nprogram implementation; it will also include all relevant departments of the MOF, SBP, SECP, \nand  the  PSX.  The  indicative  implementation  periods  are  June  2019\u2013September  2020  for \nsubprogram 1 and October 2020\u2013October 2022 for subprogram 2. \n \n28.  Disbursement and counterpart funds. The loans will be provided in two subprograms \nand will be disbursed upon fulfillment of their respective program policy actions (Appendix 4). The \nproceeds  of  the  policy-based  loan  will  be  withdrawn  following  ADB\u2019s  Loan  Disbursement \nHandbook (2017, as amended from time to time). \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n29.  The TA is estimated to cost $800,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The TA will support the implementation of key \nreform actions under the program. The major TA outputs and activities include (i) supporting \nlegislative reforms such as making the capital market tribunal operational; (ii) supporting the \ndiscontinuation of the margin trading system and development of derivatives; (iii) facilitating the \nenhancement of market infrastructure; (iv) developing asset-light sukuk structures that involve \nintangible assets; (v) building capacity and providing training, including strengthening the Institute \nof Financial Markets; and (vi) supporting the installation of a centralized trading platform for \nprimary and secondary government debt markets.18 The MOF will be the executing agency. The \nSECP and SBP will be the implementing agencies for the TA, which will be implemented over 2 \nyears, starting in July 2020. ADB will engage  36 person-months of individual international \nconsultants and 16 person-months of individual national consultants using open competitive \nbidding following the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and \nassociated staff instructions. Disbursements under the TA will follow ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office, office supplies, secretarial assistance, \nand other in-kind contributions. Transaction TA of $500,000 was approved in July 2019 for the \npreparation of subprogram 1 and has been used to develop a diagnostic study and capital market \nmaster plan, review legislation, and draft required legislative changes. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n30.  Economic and financial. The program will facilitate the mobilization of financial resources \nfor productive investment, especially by the private sector, and employment generation by \nsupporting the development of bond and equity capital markets. This will help reduce the cost of \nfinancial intermediation and help stabilize systemic vulnerabilities in the bank-dominated finance \nsystem. The specific transmission channels are as follows: \n \n18 Attached Technical Assistance Report (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10 \n(i)  By addressing policy and regulatory constraints on the issuance of corporate \nsecurities, the program will help increase the number of bond and equity issues, \nboth primary and secondary. This will facilitate the mobilization of scarce financial \nresources for long-term private sector investment. \n(ii)  By promoting the development of corporate securities markets and institutional \ninvestors, thereby diversifying financial instruments and broadening the investor \nbase, the program will reduce market volatility and improve the resilience of the \nfinance sector to external shocks. \n(iii)  By strengthening market governance in capital markets, the program will enhance \nmarket efficiency and transparency, and improve investor protection. \n \n31.  Governance. The governance risk assessment followed the Guidelines for Implementing \nADB\u2019s Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan.19 It found risks that could affect the \nprogrammatic approach, such as (i) sudden changes in administrative procedures, ministry \nleadership, and/or major staff turnover that may hinder smooth implementation of reforms cause \ndelays; (ii) political support and government ownership of reforms, envisaged under the program, \nwanes; and (iii) institutional capacity is weak. While no major risks of mismanagement of \nresources at the implementing level were discerned, and Pakistan has extensive centralized \nlegislative and institutional public financial management structures, budget execution remains an \narea of weakness. Institutional capacity development is targeted under the transaction TA and \npolicy changes under the program. \n \n32.  Poverty and social. The capital market reforms under the program will lower the cost of \nfinancial intermediation and facilitate private sector investment that will lead to higher sustainable \ngrowth and generate job opportunities. The program also mitigates the negative impact that \ncapital market instability has on the plight of the poor. It also helps Pakistan diversify its financial \nsystem so that the country can realize its broad-based economic growth and socioeconomic \ndevelopment objectives, including poverty reduction. The program seeks to address gender \ndisparities, particularly women\u2019s limited access to capital markets (women comprise more than \n49% of the population but only 7% of women in Pakistan have access to financial inclusion \nservices).20 The program  promotes  the approval  and  implementation  of  key gender  policy \ndocuments at the SECP and PSX, including the legal framework for Women Entrepreneur Bonds. \n \n33.  Safeguards.  The  program  will  have  no  anticipated  direct  or  indirect  environmental \nimpacts, will not cause involuntary resettlement, and will have no impacts on indigenous peoples. \nIn this regard, the program is classified category C for the environment, involuntary resettlement, \nand indigenous peoples. \n \n34.  Risks and mitigating measures. The program\u2019s risk assessment is rated moderate since \n(i) ADB has solid experience in the sector in Pakistan; (ii) the MOF, the proposed executing \nagency, has a good performance record in externally financed project implementation; and (iii) \nthe program is unlikely to have any impact on safeguards. Major risks that could affect the \nprogram implementation and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 2 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.21 \n \n \n19 ADB. 2008.
