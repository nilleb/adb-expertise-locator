INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) will help to achieve and sustain the expected \nimpact and outcome of the District Capitals Water Supply Project.1 The TA will provide water \nsector officials at the national level and in Manatuto and Pante Macasar with the capacity and \ninstitutional reforms needed to effectively manage, operate, and maintain urban water supply \nsystems and ensure the technical and financial sustainability of those systems. The government \nagreed on the need for sector institutional reforms on 8 November 2011 and endorsed the TA \non  24  November  2011.2  The  impact,  outcome,  and  expected  outputs  agreed  with  the \ngovernment are included in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The strategy for water supply and sanitation included in the government\u2019s Strategic \nDevelopment Plan 2011\u20132030 lists providing safe, piped 24-hour water supply to households in \n12 district centers as one of the three sector priorities.3 In line with the sector priorities of the \ngovernment, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for \nTimor-Leste  lists  as  the  outcome  for  the  sector  the  expansion  of  safe  water  supply  and \nsanitation  services  in  urban  areas,  focusing  on  increasing  management  efficiency  of  the \nsystems. 4 \n \n3.  Responsibility for operation and maintenance (O&M) of Timor-Leste\u2019s 13 urban water \nsupply schemes lies with the National Directorate for Water Supply and Sanitation (NDWSS),5 a \ndivision of the Ministry of Infrastructure (MOI). Although established with a strategic plan and \norganizational structure suited to expected corporatization, the NDWSS continues to operate as \na  government  ministry.  It  has  limited  autonomy  in  decision  making,  other  than  for  basic \noperational matters, and exhibits little accountability to its customers. All financing, fees and \ncharges,  staffing,  infrastructure  development,  and  procurement  decisions  require  the  prior \napproval of higher-level government agencies. The NDWSS acts under the oversight of the \nsecretary  of  state  within  the  MOI,  and  water  supply  legislation  makes  no  provision  for \nindependent  economic  or  technical  oversight  by  a  regulatory  body  or  for  consumer \naccountability. The NDWSS largely self-regulates its levels of service and operational efficiency. \n \n4.  Substantial development partner assistance has been provided to the NDWSS since \n2007 to help build capacity, including the Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project and the TA \n4869-TIM: Dili Water Supply Performance Improvement.6 However, the capacity of the NDWSS \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2011. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Grant to the \nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste for the District Capitals Water Supply Project. Manila (Grant 0258). The project \nwill support the government\u2019s efforts to meet Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4 to improve the health of \nchildren under the age of 5 and MDG 7 to improve environmental sustainability. The outputs of the project are (i) \nrehabilitation and expansion of public water supply systems in Pante Macasar and Manatuto, (ii) increased \nknowledge of efficient use of water and safe hygiene practices in project areas, (iii) sustainable operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) of urban water systems by the District Department for Water Supply and Sanitation (DDWSS), \n(iv) sustainable water resources in Debo Lehumo Lake, and (v) efficient management of the project by the Ministry \nof Infrastructure (MOI) and NDWSS. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 August 2011. \n3  Government of Timor-Leste. 2011. Strategic Development Plan, 2011\u20132030. Dili (July, p. 78). \n4  ADB. 2011. Country Partnership Strategy: Timor-Leste, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n5 Servicing Dili, with a population in 2010 of about 193,500, and Timor-Leste\u2019s 12 district capitals with a total \npopulation in 2010 of about 122,500 persons.  \n6  The Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project for A$28 million is financed by the Australian Agency for \nInternational Development. Implementation commenced in 2007 and is expected to be completed in 2012. ADB. \n2006.  Technical  Assistance to  the  Democratic  Republic  of  Timor-Leste  for  Dili Water  Supply  Performance \n ", "2  \n \nto plan, manage, and operate water supply systems and to develop and implement water sector \npolicies, while improving, remains weak. The capacity of the NDWSS to operate and maintain \nurban water supplies is also constrained by limited annual budgets to fund O&M. Consequently, \nmaintenance  is  reactive,  planned  asset  maintenance  programs  are  not  implemented,  and \nsystem functionality and service quality are declining.7  \n \n5.  ADB-funded interventions in Timor-Leste8 have validated the need to improve O&M of \nwater systems and to increase institutional capacity to manage urban water supply systems. \nThese improvements are vital preconditions to adequate service delivery  which cannot be \ncompensated by infrastructure investment alone. A different operational mode with an effective \nO&M strategy is required for Timor-Leste to meet its water sector development goals. Previous \nTA has focused on changing the management structure of the NDWSS without addressing the \nconstraints posed by the existing regulatory and institutional framework. Within the current \nframework, the NDWSS does not have the mandate to implement the proposed management \nstructures and procedural changes.   \n \n6.  The District Capitals Water Supply Project outcome is for NDWSS to provide safe and \nreliable water supply to district capitals\u2014Manatuto and Pante Macasar. However, to ensure the \ntechnical and financial sustainability of the water supply systems rehabilitated under the project,  \nthe MOI will have to implement institutional reforms to allow the NDWSS to make changes to its \ntechnical  and  financial  management  structure.  The  TA  will  support  the  development  and \nimplementation of an institutional reform program to facilitate changes in NDWSS management \nthat will ensure that financial and human resources to the District Department for Water Supply \nand Sanitation (DDWSS) are sufficient to operate and maintain urban water supply systems. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The TA will contribute to achieving universal access by urban households in Manatuto \nand Pante Macasar to safe, piped 24-hour water supply. The outcome of the TA is that MOI and \nNDWSS will implement a tested urban water sector institutional reform program. The outputs of \nthe TA will be the (i) adoption of an urban water sector institutional reform program by MOI and \nNDWSS,  and  (ii)  successful  implementation  of  the  proposed  NDWSS  urban  water  sector \ninstitutional reform program in Pante Macasar and Manatuto. In developing the TA, the following \nassumptions have been made: (i) the government will support the reforms, (ii) the MOI and \nNDWSS continue to support the role of DDWSS staff in the districts, and (iii) trained personnel \nare not transferred to another district after the TA completion. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n8.  At the national level, existing institutional assessments to improve water supply policy \nand  service  delivery  will  be  reviewed,  and  work  will  be  undertaken  with  the  MOI  on  the \n                                                                                                                                                       \nImprovement. Manila. (TA 4869-TIM, $1.0 million approved on 17 December).  TA activities commenced on 29 \nJune 2008 and were completed in December 2010. \n7  In 2007, $1.8 million was budgeted for urban water and sanitation recurrent expenses across Dili, Baucau, and 11 \nother district centers. About 60% was directly allocated for Dili water supply O&M, equating to about $0.11 per \ncubic meter of water produced, compared with the Southeast Asian average of $0.19 per cubic meter. \n8  ADB. 2007. Results-Based Project Management for the Pacific Developing Member Countries. Manila (TA 6436-\nREG); and ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for Dili Urban Water Supply Performance Improvement. Manila (TA \n4869-TIM). \n ", "  3\n \ninstitutional reforms needed to finalize and implement the existing draft water supply policy. \nCoordination with the Ministry of Finance and MOI will ensure that the urban water reforms \nsupport the government\u2019s draft public\u2013private partnerships policy. At the same time, the TA will \nwork closely with the NDWSS to ensure that (i) the proposed reforms address the capacity \nbuilding plans that were produced during the participatory assessment carried out under the TA \nResults Based Project Management for the Pacific Developing Member Countries, and (ii) \ntechnical and management skills in the NDWSS increase. The key output of these activities will \nbe that national and district water sector officials agree to and adopt the proposed urban water \nsector institutional reform program. \n \n9.  At  the  same time,  the TA  will  work  with  local  institutions  in the  district  capitals  of \nManatuto and Pante Macasar to ensure that (i) stakeholders and communities participate in \nnational policy discussions, and (ii) the proposed reforms can be implemented locally. Support \nwill be provided to the DDWSS, district and local administrations, and local communities to (i) \ndiscuss and provide feedback on the proposed national reforms and their implications for the \ndelivery of services at the district level, (ii) develop and adopt a detailed strategy for the \nimplementation of the proposed reforms in the two towns, and (iii) test the implementation of the \nproposed reforms in Manatuto and Pante Macasar. The outcome of these activities will be that \nPante Macasar DDWSS and Manatuto DDWSS successfully test the proposed urban water \nsector institutional reform program. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.2 million. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government contribution will consist \nof counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, transport, and remuneration of \ncounterpart staff. Detailed cost estimates are provided in Appendix 2. The proceeds of the TA \nwill be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 32 months and is expected to commence \non July 2012. The TA will provide support at the national and local levels. The MOI will be the \nexecuting agency for the TA and will be the leading agency for the outputs related to national \npolicy and institutional reforms. The MOI role will include appointing a high-level committee to \nagree on institutional reform and a strategy to implement it at the national level. The NDWSS \nwill be the leading implementing agency for testing the agreed institutional reforms in Manatuto \nand Pante Macasar. The project management unit providing support to ADB water sector \nprojects9 will provide support to the TA consultants in aspects such as financial management, \nmonitoring,  and  procurement.  For  workshops,  training  and  seminars,  and  conferences,  an \nadvance payment facility may be used. \n \n12.  ADB will recruit six individual consultants for a total of 32 person-months of international \nservices and 63 person-months of national services (Appendix 3) to (i) develop the urban water \nsector institutional reform program in partnership with the government, the private sector, and \ncommunity  stakeholders;  and  (ii)  provide  on-the-job  and  external  training  to  water  sector \n                                                \n9  A project management unit provides support for the implementation of the ongoing Dili Urban Water Supply \nPerformance Improvement Project (footnote 6) and the recently approved District Capitals Water Supply Project \n(footnote 1). \n ", "4  \n \nofficials. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use \nof Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) and all procurement will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \n13.  Under the TA, the Timor-Leste urban water sector institutional reform program and \ntraining  manuals  will  be  produced  from  the  capacity  building  activities.  These  knowledge \nproducts will be disseminated widely to water sector stakeholders and donors during a final \nworkshop.  The  results  and  outcomes  of  the  TA  will  be  reported  to  ADB  through  these \nknowledge products and ongoing monitoring by the ADB project team leader. \n \nIV.
