The Government of Viet Nam (the Government) sees public transport and inter-modal \ntransport as key elements of its urban transport strategy that will help restrain the use of private \nvehicles and improve urban livability and the urban environment.  \n2.  During the 2006 Country Programming Mission, the Government requested the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) for a project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) to identify \nproject  financing  arrangements  to  complement  ongoing  and  anticipated  financing  provided \nunder  French  bilateral  assistance  for  the  Hanoi  Metro Rail  System  Project.1 The  PPTA  is \nincluded in the 2007\u20132010 country partnership strategy for Viet Nam. \n3.  ADB  pre-fact-finding  missions2 visited  Hanoi  in  May  and  July  2006.  The  missions \nreviewed the feasibility study for the Hanoi light rapid transit (LRT) pilot line prepared under \nFrench Government assistance and confirmed the rationale for a LRT system in Hanoi. A \nmission  was  fielded  in  August  2006  to  undertake  fact-finding  for  the  PPTA.  Preliminary \nenvironmental  and  social  and  resettlement  reviews  were  undertaken,  resulting  in  an  initial \nclassification as category A for resettlement, A/B for environment, and C for indigenous people. \nThe latter mission held discussions with various government agencies,3 the French Economic \nMission, Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD), World Bank, and the Hanoi Integrated \nDevelopment and Environment Program (HAIDEP). A memorandum of understanding between \nthe Hanoi Authority for Tram and Public Transport Development Management (HATD) of the \nHanoi\u2019s Peoples Committee and ADB was signed on 21 September 2006. This reflected the \nlatest findings of the mission and the understandings reached with the Government on the \nobjectives, impact, outcome, output,4 scope, cost, implementation arrangements, and terms of \nreference for the PPTA.  \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  The Project for the Development of Transport in the Capital Hanoi by 2020, approved by \nthe Prime Minister in 1998, states the Government\u2019s intention to raise the share of public \ntransport in all transport to 30% by 2010 (of which 5\u201310% is to be urban rail) and 50% by 2020. \nIt has set the goal of implementing a first urban transit rail line by 2010. HATD is responsible for \nplanning and implementing the system.  \n5.  A feasibility study5 for a Hanoi LRT pilot line, prepared under French financing, was \ncompleted in October 2005. A consultant financed under an overseas development assistance \nloan from the French Government will start detailed design of the pilot line in the first quarter \n2007. The line extends 12.5 kilometers (km) from Hanoi Station in the city center to Nhon Depot \nwest of the city. About 3 km in the city center will be underground, and the remaining 9.5 km will \nbe elevated. The number of stations is anticipated to be 15. The feasibility study conducted \nalternatives analyses and demonstrated the rationale for such an LRT in Hanoi. Additionally, the \nongoing comprehensive urban development program, HAIDEP, which includes a section on \nurban  transport  financed  by  the  Government  of  Japan  through  the  Japan  International \n                                                 \n1  The PPTA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 12 May 2006. \n2  Comprising Hubert Jenny, senior project engineer and mission leader; Jeanne Everett, young professional; and Le \nDing Thang, program implementation officer. \n3  Including the Hanoi Authority for Tram and Public Transport Development Management, Ministry of Planning and \nInvestment, and State Bank of Viet Nam. \n4  A project design and monitoring framework is provided in Appendix 1. \n5  Two feasibility studies of about 6 months each were conducted in 2004 and 2005. \n ", "2   \nCooperation Agency (JICA), is due for completion at the end of 2006. The World Bank is \npreparing the Hanoi Urban Transport Project which would primarily focus on the development of \na bus rapid transit system for the city. This initiative follows a 2004 study financed by the Public-\nPrivate Infrastructure Advisory Facility, which examined institutional issues and opportunities for \nprivate  sector  participation  in  the  bus  sector  and  supported  the  successful  allocation  of \noperating franchises to two new bus operators in 2004. The European Union funded in large \npart the Asia Trans project which took place between 2002 and 2005 aimed at improving the \npublic  transport  in  Hanoi  and  the  existing  bus  transit  network  in  particular,  through  the \ndevelopment of three pilot bus lines.  \n6.  Increased Mobility and Demand for Urban Transport. Viet Nam is among the world's \nfastest-growing economies, registering 7.5% growth in 2004 and 8.1% in 2005. It has caught the \neye of investors with its strong economic performance, political stability, and ambitious and \nindustrious workforce. Investments and exports are driving growth in Viet Nam, leading to higher \nincomes and rapidly improving living standards. Its capital city, Hanoi, has recorded an average \neconomic growth of 11% per annum in recent years, and this growth is expected to remain in \nthe range of 11\u201312% until 2020. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in Hanoi is expected \nto continue growing well above 5% per annum up to 2025. Hanoi is a metropolis of 3 million \nwhose growth is spurred by rural-to-urban migration, the opening of its economy, and a growing \nreal estate sector, and whose population is forecast to reach 3.2\u20134 million by 2010, perhaps \ndoubling by 2020.6 The Hanoi Peoples Committee has to balance the pressure of growing \ndemand for mobility with a desire to preserve the historic city center with its many monuments \nand lakes. Reflecting this, the city has developed a plan to expand to new urban developments \non the outskirts of the city, all of which will require transport links to the city center, and within \nand among themselves. \n7.  Rising Private Vehicle Ownership in a Congested Road Network. Recent traffic \nsurveys7 show that motorcycles account for 83% of vehicles in the city and bicycles, used \nmainly by the poor, account for 12%. Cars account for 4.5% and buses for less than 1%.8 Car \nownership has been low historically, relative to comparable economies in the region, but will \nrise.9 Expected growth in household income will make a car affordable to many more families, \nparticularly as prices have fallen recently following the Government\u2019s decision to again allow the \nimportation of used vehicles. If current trends are not met by better transport infrastructure and \npublic transport systems, Hanoi faces worsened congestion, road safety deterioration, and \nincreasing air pollution in the coming years, which will be exacerbated in the narrow streets of \nthe city center. Existing examples of congestion and air pollution in such large Asian cities as \nBangkok, Beijing, Jakarta, and Manila compounds the pressure on the Government to adopt \npreventive measures and prioritize investments in urban transport infrastructure. \n8.  Hanoi Needs an Ambitious Urban Transport Investment Plan. To achieve its goals, \nthe Hanoi People\u2019s Committee envisages (i) expanding a high-capacity road network with three \nring  roads,  (ii)  constructing  new  bridges  across  the  Red  River  which  divides  the  city,  (iii) \ndeveloping an urban rail network of eight lines, and (iv) implementing complementary urban and \ninter-urban bus networks allowing for inter-modal transfers with the rail system. The overall \nurban transport network is being examined under the JICA-funded HAIDEP study. According to \n                                                 \n6  Population figures from the Hanoi Statistics Office. \n7  Conducted  by  Intitut  des  Metiers  de  la  Ville,  Hanoi,  in  April  2004  and  available  at \nwww.hanoibus.com/transp_0EN.htm. \n8  Share distribution in passenger terms are 74% for motorbikes, 8% for bicycles, 4% for cars, and 14% for buses.  \n9  By mid-2005, only one in 145 people had a car, compared with one in 4\u20135 in Malaysia, 9\u201310 in Thailand, and 30\u2013\n32 in the Philippines (Source: People's Daily, 20 March 2006). \n ", "  3\nthe preliminary feasibility study for the Hanoi LRT pilot line, its estimated total investment of \n$600 million will be financed in part (about 60%) through a concessional bilateral loan from the \nGovernment of France combining tied financing of about $250 million for the rolling stock and \nequipment  and  untied  financing  from  AFD  of  about  $100  million10 for  part  of  the  line\u2019s  \ninfrastructure. The balance of about $250 million (about 40%) will be the responsibility of the \nHanoi  Peoples  Committee.  The  PPTA  will  provide  a  mechanism  to  define  how  innovative \nfinancing schemes can be applied to public, and possibly public-private, investments in the \nmass transport sector in Viet Nam. In the case of the LRT pilot line, it will help the Hanoi \nPeoples Committee define options for financing its share of the project cost.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The PPTA will advise the Hanoi People\u2019s Committee on options available for financing \nits share of the cost of the LRT pilot line which, combined with the already-committed financing \nfrom France, will contribute to a safe, clean, and efficient urban transport system. It will reduce \nreliance  on  private  modes  of  travel,  contributing  to  urban  livability  and  accommodating \nsustainable growth. A design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 and an initial poverty \nand social assessment is in Appendix 2. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The objective of the PPTA is to assist the Hanoi Peoples Committee with developing a \nproject that is suitable for financing and has a viable financing plan, covering both the committed \nbilateral financing and the additional financing required to complete the LRT pilot line\u2019s physical \ninfrastructure. The PPTA, for which terms of references are provided in Appendix 3, will be \nimplemented in two parts over a 5-month period: \n(i)  Part 1: assisting the Hanoi Peoples Committee with developing an approach for \nfinancing its share of the cost of the LRT pilot line, about $250 million, using \nvarious financing schemes including but not limited to ADB-financed products \nand  instruments  for  credit  enhancements,  multi-tranche  financing,  and  local \ncurrency financing on a sovereign, sub-sovereign, or non-sovereign basis,11 and \na benchmarking exercise with alternative products available in the market, and \n(ii)  Part  2:  due  diligence  on  technical,  financial,  institutional,  and  safeguard \ncompliance, the latter with respect to ADB\u2019s policies and procedures for the \nenvironment, resettlement, and social development. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The  cost  of  the  PPTA  is  estimated  at  $490,000  equivalent,  of  which  the  foreign \nexchange cost is $300,000 and the local currency cost is $190,000 equivalent. ADB will finance \n$400,000, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost and a portion of the local currency cost \namounting to $100,000 equivalent. The PPTA will be financed as a grant from ADB\u2019s technical \nassistance funding program. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 4. \n                                                 \n10 The official figures are denominated in euros: \u20ac200 million of tied financing and \u20ac80 million from AFD. \n11 The products proposed will take account of recent developments in the context of ADB\u2019s Innovation and Efficiency \nInitiative. \n ", "4   \n12.  The Hanoi Peoples Committee will finance the remaining $90,000 equivalent of local \ncurrency  costs  though  in-kind  contributions  of  office  space  for  up  to  five  consultants  and \nconnections to international telephone and Internet lines (with usage paid through the PPTA \nconsultants\u2019 contract); counterpart staff about 30 person-months to support the international \nconsultants and allow the transfer of practical experience and knowledge; vehicles for site visits; \ntopographic survey data to confirm resettlement impacts; and any other information that may be \nidentified as essential during PPTA implementation. The Government has been informed that \napproval of the PPTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  HATD will be the Executing Agency for the PPTA with overall responsibility for the Hanoi \nPeoples Committee\u2019s contribution. HATD will provide counterpart personnel to work with the \nPPTA consultants as well as with other government agencies and stakeholders, and will also \nprovide documents, reports, etc, relevant to the project prepared by other consultants and \nagencies. \n14.  The PPTA will have duration of 5 months, expected to commence on 1 March 2007 and \nend on 31 July 2007. It will require an estimated 30 person-months of consulting services, 14 of \ninternational consultants and 16 of national consultants. All consultants will be engaged by ADB \nin accordance with Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (April 2006, as amended from time to \ntime). \n15.  Part 1 will be implemented by a team of three international consultants (7 person-\nmonths) and two national consultants (4 person-months), who will be engaged as individuals: \none specialist in capital market development for 3 person-months, one specialist in guarantees \nand insurance for 2 person-months, and one legal adviser for 1 person-month, supported by a \nnational legal counsel for 2 person-months and a project adviser for 2 person-months. One of \nthe three individual international consultants selected for Part 1 will be designated as team \nleader for Part 1 and will be allocated an additional person-month to consolidate the reports \nfrom the other two consultants for submission to the Hanoi Peoples Committee and to ADB. The \nteam leader will submit an inception report and detailed work plan for Part 1 within 1 month of \nthe commencement of the PPTA, a midterm report at the end of the third month, and a draft \nfinal report in the fifth month. \n16.  Part 2 of the PPTA will be carried out by individual consultants (about 7 person-months \nof international and 12 national) for conducting due diligence of the project feasibility study and \nsafeguard compliance. The consultants will be specialized in (i) environmental assessment (1.5 \nperson-months international and 3 national); (ii) social development and resettlement (3 person-\nmonths international and 9 national); (iii) urban transport planning and rail civil engineering and \ninvestment planning and operations (1.5 person-months, international); and (iv) institutional, \nfinancial, and economic analysis (1.5 person-months, international). Each consultant for Part 2 \nwill be responsible for his/her individual output, and will be coordinated by ADB\u2019s task manager \nfor the project.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for Preparing the Hanoi Metro Rail System Project and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nSafe, clean, and  Reduced travel time in project  Government and   \u2022  Ongoing government and \nefficient urban  corridor  transport sector  private sector commitment \ntransport system in    statistics  and resources to operate \nHanoi, including  Reduced traffic congestion,    and maintain the system \nlight rapid transit  accidents, and environmental  Traffic surveys,  \u2022  User adoption is in line \n(LTR),  pollution  accident and hospital  with forecasts.  \naccommodates    records, and  \u2022  Detailed design, \nsustainable growth  Increased share of travel by  environmental records  construction, and \nand improves  public transport modes    operation occur as \nurban livability    Public opinion and  planned and in line with \n  Service perceived by consumers  customer surveys  ADB due diligence \nto be affordable, high quality, and    recommendations. \nlargely free of fraud  Official reports and   \n  feedback from Hanoi  Risks \nAchieved ridership meets or  People\u2019s Committee  \u2022  Complementary and inter-\nexceeds level expected under  and Ministry of  modal urban transport \nconservative scenarios  Transport   services to be integrated \n    with the line are not \nAsian Development  implemented efficiently or \nBank (ADB) country  effectively or compete with \nmonitoring of baseline  the service. \nIndicators \n\u2022  Public transport service \n \noperations and financial \nOperator records \nstructure are not \nsustainable in the long \nterm. \nOutcome  Enduring institutional and  Consultant\u2019s working  Assumptions \nGovernment of Viet  implementation arrangements for  papers and reports  \u2022  Overseas development \nNam able to  mass transit development and    assistance financing \nmanage  operation   Project preparatory  arrangements and \ncompetitive and  technical assistance  supporting conditions for \nOptimal and affordable \nsustainable  (PPTA) completion  the line are appropriate, \ncounterpart financial \nfinancing and  report  economic, competitive, \narrangements for LRT pilot line, in \ninstitutional    secure, and timely \nthe short and long term, relative \narrangements for  Official reports and  \u2022  Cooperation and \nto comparable projects in the \nurban LRT project  feedback from Hanoi  commitment of concerned \nregion \nin Hanoi in  People\u2019s Committee  government agencies and \nagreement with key  Risks are allocated to parties  and Ministry of  participating sponsors, \npartners and ADB  most able to manage them, priced  Transport   financiers, and guarantors \nfairly, and met with effective    to coordinate and \nmitigation strategies  Industry and financial  implement \nsector data including  recommendations \nProject design satisfies scrutiny of \nthat from similar   \nADB due diligence \nprojects \n \nLong-term financial \nand passenger \nrecords of LRT \noperations  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nOutputs  By month 3:    Assumptions \n1.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reducing poverty in Viet Nam: \nThe Country Strategy Program 2006\u20132009 stresses the importance of maintaining sustainable, equitable economic \ngrowth to achieve further reductions in poverty. Viet Nam\u2019s success in bringing down the poverty rate from 70% in \n1990 to 27% in 2005 is based on the rapid and equitable economic growth recorded during this period. The \nGovernment\u2019s strategy for Hanoi is to actively develop public transport and road infrastructure to alleviate congestion \nand open up new areas for urbanization. Linkage between public transport and new urban areas will provide better \naccess to services and employment opportunities. The proposed project is expected to support the development of a \npilot light rapid transit (LRT) line in Hanoi to provide convenient, comfortable, safe, affordable, and clean urban travel. \nIntroducing LRT lines will provide cheaper transportation than by motorbike and car. The new metropolitan railway will \nbring time savings to people now using motorcycles, cars, buses, etc. The saved travel time will be available for more \nproductive activities. An urban public transport system will help address growing pressures on roads and the \nenvironment that result from rapid growth in high-density areas such as Hanoi that would otherwise damage the \nproject area\u2019s quality of life, working environment, and ability to attract investment. Investment and better access to \nservices will reduce poverty. The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy will be reviewed to identify the role and \nimpact of large-scale infrastructure projects such as the proposed project in overall poverty reduction in Viet Nam. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nFollowing the Enhanced Poverty Reduction Strategy (December 2004) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), \nprojects classified as general intervention no longer require project-wide poverty assessments. However, social \nassessments will be prepared for resettlement, HIV/AIDS, and the personal safety and security of passengers and \nstaff as they represent risks in implementing the project. The resettlement plan will have mitigation measures to \naddress impoverishment from displacement and land acquisition. The terms of reference for social development and \nresettlement specialists are included in the consulting services.  \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?

Gender Development \n \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe consultants will conduct a brief gender assessment of the households affected by resettlement. In addition, an \nassessment will be done on the impact of rapid transit lines on male and female user groups for private and public \ntransportation in terms of safety, time savings, and transport costs, etc. Required services and facilities in stations for \nmen and women will be also identified. A gender plan for addressing gender concerns in the project related to \nresettlement, HIV/AIDS, safety measures, facilities in stations, and capacity building in the Executing Agency and \nrelevant stakeholders will be prepared for the proposed project. \n \nHas an output been prepared?

Objective \n1.  The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) will help the Hanoi Authority for \nTram  and  Public  Transport  Development  Management  (HATD)  to  optimize  the  plan  for \ncounterpart funding to finance the implementation of the Hanoi light rapid transit (LRT) pilot line. \nDue diligence will also be undertaken as part of this work.  \nB.  Detailed Tasks \n2.  The PPTA will have a duration of about 5 months, commencing in March 2007 and \nrequiring an estimated 14 person-months of international consultancy supported by 16 person-\nmonths of national consultancy. The objective of the PPTA is to optimize Viet Nam counterpart \nfinancing (estimated to about $220 million) through bonds issues, local currency financing, and \nloans supported by various Asian Development Bank (ADB) financing instruments and credit-\nenhancement  products  for  the  Hanoi  Metro  Project.  The  project  is  cofinanced  by  bilateral \noverseas development assistance loans of \u20ac280 million, \u20ac200 million of which is tied and \u20ac80 \nmillion untied. A feasibility study has been completed, and a bilateral consultant financed under \nthe bilateral loans will start the detailed design in first quarter 2007. The PPTA will be articulated \nin two parts:  \n(i)  optimizing  the  counterpart  financing  plan  using  various  financing  schemes \nincluding but not limited to various ADB financing products and instruments for \ncredit enhancements, multi-tranche financing, and local currency financing on \nsovereign, sub-sovereign or non-sovereign basis, and a benchmarking exercise \nwith alternative products available in the market, and  \n(ii)  due diligence on technical, financial, institutional, and safeguard compliance with \nADB  procedures  regarding  the  environment,  resettlement,  and  social \ndevelopment.  \n1.  Part 1: Alternative Financing for Local Counterpart Funding  \n3.  Part 1 will be implemented by a team of three international consultants (7 person-\nmonths) and two national consultants (4 person-months), who will be engaged as individual \nconsultants: One specialist in capital market development (3 person-months), one specialist in \nguarantees  and  insurance  (2  person-months),  and  one  legal  adviser  (1  person-month), \nsupported by a national legal counsel (2 person-months) and a project adviser (2 person-\nmonths) to disseminate the results and outcomes of the PPTA to stakeholders. One of the three \ninternational consultants selected for Part 1 will be designated as team leader of Part 1 and will \nbe allocated an additional person-month to consolidate the report from the other two consultants \nfor submission to the Hanoi People's Committee and ADB. The consultant will have expertise in \nproject finance and structured trade finance; a proven track record in financing infrastructure \nprojects  in  the  region,  specifically  in  the  transportation  sector  (with  Viet  Nam  experience \npreferred); and demonstrated knowledge of ADB financing instruments and credit-enhancement \nproducts including but not limited to local currency financing, guarantees to support lending, and \nbond issues in local or foreign currency. Experience in dealing with export credit agencies, \nmultilateral development banks, investment banks, public-private guarantee instruments, local \ncurrency funding, public finance, and capital markets will be key selection factors.  \n                                                 \n1 More detailed individual terms of reference generated through the ADB individual consultant recruitment system \nwill be provided when individual consultants are contracted. \n ", "Appendix 3  11 \n(i)   Project finance (capital market). The consultant will look at the options to raise \ncounterpart  financing,  in  particular  through  the  capital  market,  and  define \nstrategies  for  capital  market  enhancements,  including  using  ADB  financing \ninstruments.  He  or  she  will  examine  issues  associated  with  local  currency \nfinancing  versus  foreign  exchange  financing,  including  commercial  and \nconcessional lending and bonds in local or foreign currencies with and without \ncentral or local government guarantees. The consultant will liaise with the other \nconsultants to review the use of various financial products in the current legal \nframework. The output will be a matrix presenting the different financing schemes \nthat provide for limited recourse financing in respect of the maximum amount of \nthe capital cost of the project, with terms and conditions and comments from the \nconsultant.  \n(ii)  Project finance (guarantee). The consultant will look at the different financial \nand credit-enhancement products available on the market for Viet Nam including \nbut not limited to ADB financing instruments and guarantees with and without \ncentral  or  local  government  guarantees  and  counter-indemnity,  supplier \nfinancing, export credit agency financing and guarantees, and private sector \nguarantees (commercial and political risk insurance). He or she will liaise with the \nother consultants to optimize the counterpart financing plan in the current legal \nframework. The output will be a matrix showing the implications of the several \nfinancing schemes evaluated as suitable for Viet Nam, with comments from the \nconsultant. \n(iii)  Legal  advisor. The consultant will define for the other consultants the legal \nframework for project financing in Viet Nam. The consultant will liaise with Part 2 \nconsultants to look into the institutional framework and will recommend ways to \noptimize the legal structure of the operating entity. He or she will review with \neach of the consultants their proposed financing options and comment on and \nconfirm their possible implementation in the current legal context of Viet Nam. \nThe consultant will be supported by a national consultant. The output will be a \nreport comprising comments on the matrices for project financing proposed by \nthe other consultants and a matrix with comments on a possible structure for the \noperating entity. \n(iv)   Team  leader.  The  team  leader,  who  will  be  one  of  the  three  international \nconsultants on the team, will consolidate the output of the whole team for Part 1 \nof the PPTA and finalize one matrix to be presented to the Hanoi Authority for \nTram and Public Transport Development Management (HATD, the Executing \nAgency), ADB project officers, and other stakeholders. To support the study, the \nteam leader, assisted by the project team, will outline financial structures that \nhave been recently used in similar projects, subject to confidentiality concerns. \nHe  or  she  will  outline  as  case  studies  the  financing  schemes  used  for  the \nChannel Tunnel, Kuala Lumpur Mass Rapid Transit, Bangkok Transit System \nCorporation, Bangkok Mass Rapid Transit Authority, Manila Mass Rail Transit, \nand the High Speed Rail System in Taipei. This will serve as background to the \nHanoi  People\u2019s  Committee  and  help  it  evaluate  the  likely  advantages  and \ndisadvantages of the proposed options. The consultant should also identify the \nextent to which its proposed financing will rely on conditions in the concession \ncontract that is awarded to the developer and evaluate leasing arrangements as \na means of raising funds. The team leader, assisted by the project team, will \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nassess  the  Government\u2019s  and  financial  sector\u2019s  capacity  to  implement  the \nproposed  financing  schemes  and  propose  and  initiate  capacity-building \ninterventions.

During the workshop, the various stakeholders and \ncounterparts  will  discuss  the  presented  options  and  select  one  or  several \npreferred options that may or may not involve ADB financial products. The team \nleader  will  manage  a  provisional  lump  sum  of  $5,000  to  organize  the \ndissemination workshop. Afterwards, the consultant will finalize a time-bound \naction plan to implement the selected option for counterpart financing and, if an \nADB financial product is seen most suitable, prepare a draft Board document \nincluding a design and monitoring framework for the ensuing project.  \n4.  The proposed financing options are expected to apply specifically to the Hanoi Metro \nRail System project but also be generally adaptable to structure financing of larger infrastructure \nprojects by the Government of Viet Nam. This effort will be in the context of ADB's recent \nundertaking  for  more  liberalized  credit-enhancement  products.  ADB  will  play  the  role  of \nfacilitator for these agreements and, by providing its endorsement, provide the necessary quality \nguaranty to attract the interested of appropriate financial partners.  \n2.
