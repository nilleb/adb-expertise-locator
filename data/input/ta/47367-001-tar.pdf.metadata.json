INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Priorities and Action Agenda of the Government of Vanuatu is the current national \ndevelopment plan for 2006\u20132015.1 As the current national development plan ends in 2015, the \ngovernment has started the preparation of a new development plan, and has asked the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to assist this process.2 \n \n2.  While the government has prior experience in development planning, it is looking to ADB \nto strengthen its capacity in this area. A core team was established to lead the preparation of \nthe proposed national sustainable development plan (NSDP). It is made up of representatives \nfrom the government, civil society, the private sector, academia, and development partners. \nWhile the NSDP core team will lead the process, ADB will provide technical support to assist the \nGovernment prepare the NSDP in accordance with sound development planning principles and \nprocesses. \n \n3.  Government  agencies  and  development  partners  were  consulted  on  the  proposed \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  during  the  ADB  workshop  on  the  Vanuatu  country  operations \nbusiness plan, 2015\u20132017 in Port Vila in March 2014. Consultation with the Department of \nStrategic Policy Planning and Aid Coordination (DSPPAC) and the NSDP core team took place \nduring March\u2013May 2014, and the government agreed with the TA as proposed. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  The Priorities and Action Agenda sets out a national vision for Vanuatu, and is based on \nthe need for private-sector-led economic growth and on supporting activities in the primary \nsectors of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, as well as in tourism. The vision recognizes that \nthe government\u2019s role is to create an enabling environment for both domestic and foreign \ninvestors while ensuring that development is sustainable. \n \n5.  The vision under the current national development plan reflects the need, as expressed \nby the people of Vanuatu, for more employment and income-generating opportunities, for better \nhealth and education, and for the provision of basic infrastructure for themselves and for their \nchildren, and also reflects a wish for social stability. The key priority areas under the agenda are \n(i)  private  sector  development  and  employment  creation;  (ii)  macroeconomic  stability  and \nequitable  growth;  (iii)  good  governance  and  public  sector  reform;  (iv)  primary  sector \ndevelopment (natural resources and the environment); (v) provision of better basic services, \nespecially in rural areas; (vi) education and human resource development; and (vii) economic \ninfrastructure and support services. \n \n                                                \n1  Government of Vanuatu. 2006.

In February 2013, an update of the agenda was completed.4 This update was based on \na thorough review of progress in implementing the agenda policies since 2006. The review took \nplace  from  2010  to  2012  and  was  conducted  by  the  government  in  consultation  with \nstakeholders and with the assistance from the United Nations Development Programme. \n \n7.  The review found that progress since 2006 had been solid in many areas, but in others \nVanuatu was falling behind and had lost the momentum for reform. The review found that \nservice delivery had not improved in some areas and only slowly in others. It concluded that \nmore effort was needed to secure political stability and improve public sector performance. \n \n8.  The proposed NSDP will be developed in the context of an environment of reasonably \nstrong economic growth. Vanuatu\u2019s economic performance\u2014driven by tourism, real estate, \nconstruction, and assistance from development partners\u2014has been robust since 2003. The \nVanuatu economy achieved its 11th successive year of positive economic growth in 2013. \nFiscal  management  has  been  sound  and  some  reforms  have  been  introduced.  Future \nperformance depends on private sector investment and government investment in infrastructure. \nHowever, inadequate physical infrastructure, poor governance, an outdated legal and regulatory \nenvironment  for  private  sector  investment  (although  currently  being  modernized),  and \ngovernment involvement in inefficient enterprises that crowd out the private sector constrain \nprivate sector development. In addition, the lack of access to affordable capital and the related \nsupporting  infrastructure  constrains  the  development  of  the  domestic  private  sector  and \ntherefore there is a heavy reliance on foreign direct investment. \n \n9.  Despite this reasonably strong economic growth, Vanuatu is likely to achieve only two of \nthe Millennium Development Goals\u2014reducing child mortality (goal 4) and combating HIV/AIDS, \nmalaria, and other diseases (goal 6)\u2014by the target date of 2015. Mixed progress is being made \nin eradicating extreme poverty and hunger (goal 1), achieving universal primary education \n(goal 2), promoting gender equality and empowering women (goal 3), and improving maternal \nhealth (goal 5). Vanuatu is not on track to ensuring environmental sustainability (goal 7).5 The \nNSDP envisages localizing the Millennium Development Goals and going beyond the target \nindicators. \n \n10.  The issues that are of the greatest concern for development planning include inequality \nof income distribution, the poverty of opportunity confronted by much of the population, lack of \nformal employment and income-generating opportunities for school-leavers in the face of rapid \npopulation growth, and limited access to high-quality education. Environmental and cultural \nsustainability within this development context is also of paramount importance, which is further \ncomplicated by climate change issues. \n \n11.  About 80% of the population lives in rural areas, although rural\u2013urban drift has led to an \nurban population growth rate of 4% per annum. ADB estimates indicate that by 2020, Vanuatu\u2019s \nurban population will exceed 25% of its total population. Poverty of opportunity is prevalent in \nrural areas where health, education, and transportation facilities are limited and formal sector \nemployment  opportunities  lacking,  and  although  traditional  governance  systems  remain \nrelatively robust, there is a high risk of these being eroded. In general, urban incomes are higher \nthan rural incomes, although a new class of urban poor\u2014particularly in the peri-urban areas\u2014is \ndeveloping. The proposed NSDP will need to consider these issues. In addition, the NSDP will \n                                                \n4  Government of Vanuatu. 2013. 2012 Update.

ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2010\u20132014 for Vanuatu recognizes the importance \nof stronger coordination between stakeholders for the planning and delivery of services in \nVanuatu, and the need to strengthen the planning capability of key government agencies. The \nTA will directly support the development of Vanuatu\u2019s national and sector priorities for 2016\u2013\n2030. \n \n13.  In  preparing  the  TA,  the  following  assumptions  were  made:  (i)  strong  government \ncommitment to the preparation of the NSDP, (ii) well-coordinated approach to the preparation of \nthe  NSDP  by  all  stakeholders,  and (iii)  strong  commitment  to  and  timely  support from  all \nstakeholders  to  ensure  achievement  of  outputs.  The  following  risks  have  been  identified: \n(i) political instability leading to delays in preparation of the NSDP, and (ii) lack of timely delivery \nof inputs by the government.  \n \n14.  A stakeholder analysis drawing on and expanding on the existing stakeholder groups \nthat  have  been  identified  by  the  core  group,  and  an  associated  participation  plan  will  be \nprepared to assist with risk mitigation. The stakeholder analysis will help recognize (i) potential \nrisks,  conflicts,  and  constraints  that  could  affect  the  NSDP  process;  (ii)  opportunities  and \npartnerships that could be explored and developed; and (iii) vulnerable or marginalized groups \nthat are usually left out of the planning process. The associated participation plan will assist in \nguiding stakeholder participation throughout the preparation of the NSDP. The plan captures \nactivities and enables their documentation and evaluation.7 \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n15.  The impact of the TA will be that the NSDP guides the implementation and monitoring of \nVanuatu\u2019s  development  vision  and  priorities.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  stronger \ngovernment capacity for development planning and managing for development results. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  ADB will draw on its experience in development planning in other Pacific countries, and \nwill  also  provide  the  technical  skills  and  support  in  planning,  monitoring,  and  evaluation \nprocesses and systems, to assist in the preparation of the proposed NSDP.8 \n \n17.  The TA will deliver the following outputs and associated activities over 2014\u20132016: \n \n(i)  Strengthened  development  planning  processes.  The  TA  will  support \nDSPPAC and the NSDP core team in the preparation of an NSDP for 2016\u20132030. \n                                                \n6  United  Nations  Development  Programme.  2009.

The TA \nwill support the government to ensure that appropriate processes and systems \nare in place to implement and monitor the NSDP. \n \nIn particular, the TA will work with DSPPAC to establish a framework for regular \nmonitoring and reporting against the NSDP, help government agencies to put in \nplace the systems to implement and measure achievements under the NSDP, \nand  ensure  that  the  NSDP  is  utilized  as  a  mechanism  for  managing  for \ndevelopment results. \n \n18.  The two outputs will support the achievement of the outcome through the provision of \nadvice, support, and training on development planning preparation and associated monitoring \nand evaluation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $480,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). \n \n20.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \naccommodation,  overhead  costs,  and  other  in-kind  contributions.  The  cost  estimates  and \nfinancing plan is in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ADB will be the executing agency and DSPPAC\u2014which is located in the Office of the \nPrime Minister\u2014will be the implementing agency. Disbursements under the TA will be made in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n22.  The TA will require international consultants (an estimated 12 person-months of inputs) \nand national consultants (an estimated 16 person-months of inputs) with skills and expertise in \nthe formulation of national development plans, monitoring and evaluation, and consultation and \nparticipation. All consultants will be engaged individually, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non  the  Use  of  Consultants  (2013,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  TA  activities  will  be \nimplemented over 21 months, from 1 October 2014 to 30 June 2016. The outline terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 3. \n                                                \n9  These activities are aligned with the terms of reference for the NSDP core team. \n ", "  5 \n \n23.
