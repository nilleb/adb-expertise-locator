INTRODUCTION \n1.  In late 2009, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Management (MFEM) of Vanuatu \nrequested Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance (TA) to develop and implement \na state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform program. The government\u2019s commitment to SOE reform \nis articulated in (i) Council of Minister's decisions 125 and 126/2009;1 (ii) its \u201cPlanning Long, \nActing Short\u201d matrix of policy priorities for 2009\u22122012; and (iii) its recent efforts to restructure \ntwo of the largest SOEs, the Vanuatu Commodities Marketing Board and Air Vanuatu. SOE \nreform is also an integral part of the approach to supporting private sector development in the \nADB country partnership strategy 2010\u20132014 for Vanuatu.2  \n \n2.  The April 2010 fact-finding mission resulted in a memorandum of understanding outlining \nthe agreed impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference for \nthe TA to support the government's SOE reform program. The TA will be provided concurrently \nwith SOE reform measures already under way, including (i) the development of a restructuring \nplan for Air Vanuatu, which was initiated in May 2010 with Australian Agency for International \nDevelopment support; (ii) the proposed repeal of the Vanuatu Commodities Marketing Board \nAct and amendment to the Public Finance and Economic Management Act, both of which were \nendorsed by Parliament in the second quarter of 2010; and (iii) the new Companies (Insolvency \nand Receivership) Bill, also expected to be considered by Parliament in the third quarter of 2010. \nThe new Companies (Insolvency and Receiverships) Act, which was developed with ADB TA \nsupport, will provide a modern and country-specific regime for the dissolution of companies, \nincluding SOEs. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Vanuatu's SOEs absorb large amounts of scarce capital and provide very low returns, \ndivert government resources away from vital social investments in health and education, and \ndrive up the costs of doing business where they are the sole service providers. While poor \nfinancial  reporting  practices  mean  accurately  estimating  the  extent  of  the  fiscal  strain \nrepresented by the SOEs is difficult, a recent financial audit of one of the larger SOEs revealed \nthat its accumulated losses totaled $20 million. Moreover, recent court rulings have affirmed that \nby virtue of the Public Finance and Economic Management Act 2006, the government can be \nconsidered a guarantor of the debts of SOEs. Vanuatu has 22 SOEs: 14 are engaged in \ncommercial  activities,4 and  the  remaining  8  perform  various  noncommercial  functions  for \ngovernment.5 Only 4 of the 14 commercial SOEs have  produced or reported  producing a \ncommercial return in the past 5 years. \n \n                                                 \n1  Desisen 125/2009: Review of Report on Copra Industry and Role of VCMB; Desisen 126/2009: State-Owned \nEnterprise Reform. \n2  ADB. 2009. Country Partnership Strategy: Vanuatu, 2010\u20132014. Manila. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB's website on 3 June 2010. \n4  Of the 14 commercial entities, 9 are majority-owned by the central government, while the remaining 5 are minority \nshareholdings. \n5  National Tourism Office, Vanuatu Financial Services Commission, Reserve Bank of Vanuatu, Asset Management \nUnit, Utility Regulatory Authority, Vanuatu Telecommunications Regulator, Vanuatu Commodities Marketing Board, \nand Vanuatu Investment Promotion Authority. \n ", "2 \n \n4.  The poor performance of the commercial SOEs can be attributed to two interrelated \nfactors:  \n \n(i)  Absence of a robust legal, governance, and monitoring framework. In the \nabsence  of  a  robust  governance  framework  for  most  SOEs,  these  entities \noperate  without  performance  targets  or  accountability  for  results.  Director \nappointments are not made on the basis of professional qualifications; in the \nabsence of performance contracts or statements of corporate intent, directors are \nnot  held  accountable  for  their  performance  on  the  boards  or  for  SOE \nperformance. In some cases, directors\u2019 fees and expenses are often well above \nprudent  standards,  and  never  linked  to  outcomes,  further  distorting  any \nperformance incentives.  \n \n(ii)  Poorly  defined  mandates,  mixing  commercial  with  noncommercial \nactivities. Compounding the weak governance frameworks is the absence of a \nclear mandate for many SOEs. Profit objectives are often mixed with directives to \ndeliver community service obligations (CSOs), without due consideration to the \nfinancial  impact  of  the  CSOs  on  the  SOE.  This  distorts  the  performance \nincentives  of  the  SOE  and  complicates  the  decision-making  process  of  the \nboards. The existence of multiple shareholding ministries further complicates the \noperating environment and independence of the SOEs, as these ministries can \nand do originate CSO requests. To operate efficiently, commercial SOEs should \nhave unambiguous profit objectives and a transparent mechanism to identify, \ncontract,  and  finance  any  CSOs.  Without  this,  SOEs  cannot  set  and  meet \nperformance targets, and the government cannot ensure that it is getting value \nfor money for these CSOs or SOEs. \n \n5.  Previous government efforts to reform the SOE sector have had mixed results, largely \ndue to the vested interests of the poorest performing SOE boards to maintain the status quo, \nwhere SOEs can operate without hard budget constraints, accountability, or consequences for \npoor  performance.  With  the  October  2009  Council  of  Minister's  decision,  a  larger  political \nconsensus for reform has been achieved, providing the foundation for strengthening the legal \nand governance framework for the SOE sector. This step will be essential for establishing \nsustainable improvements in the sector\u2019s financial performance. \n \n6.  The TA will support the development and implementation of an SOE reform program in \nVanuatu to relieve the fiscal strain that SOEs place on the state budget and ensure that SOEs \ndo not compromise consumer welfare or crowd out the private sector. To achieve this objective, \naction will be required to (i) strengthen the legal, governance, and monitoring framework for the \nSOE portfolio as a whole; and (ii) restructure the operations of selected priority SOEs.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The expected impact of the TA is reduced drain on the fiscal position of the government \nfrom  underperforming  public  enterprises.  This  will  be  measured  by  the  decrease  in  fiscal \ntransfers to SOEs and reduction in the growth of contingent liabilities. \n \n8.  The TA outcomes will be improved financial, operating, and governance performance of \nSOEs. By the end of the TA, the legal, regulatory, and governance framework for SOEs will \n ", "3 \n \nhave been strengthened, at least four SOEs will have implemented rationalization measures, \nand the government will have agreed to a longer-term SOE reform pipeline, all of which will \ncontribute to sustainability of the reforms. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will build on the analytical work prepared under ADB's regional Private Sector \nDevelopment Initiative,6 which produced a 2009 comparative study tracking the performance \ndrivers of the SOEs in the Fiji Islands, Samoa, and Tonga.7 Vanuatu\u2019s minister of finance and \neconomic  management  endorsed  the  study's  recommendations  as  directly  applicable  to \nVanuatu's SOEs, and stressed the importance of placing SOEs on a fully commercial footing. \nTo achieve this goal, SOEs must have unambiguous commercial mandates, and the freedom \nand incentive to operate on commercial terms. Any and all regulatory activities must be carved \nout of their core commercial operations, and CSOs delivered within the commercial framework. \nThe minister recognized that placing Vanuatu's SOEs on a commercial footing would require \nwholesale  reform  of  their  legal,  governance,  and  monitoring  frameworks,  in  parallel  with \nindividual SOE restructuring efforts.  \n \n10.  The TA will begin with strengthening the legal, governance, and monitoring frameworks \nfor SOEs. This work will include (i) drafting an SOE act;8 (ii) establishing a robust process for the \nselection, appointment, and accountability of directors; (iii) strengthening the capacity of the \nSOE directors to execute their mandates; (iv) establishing a framework for contracting and \nfinancing CSOs; and (v) clarifying the role and responsibilities of the monitoring agency within \nMFEM.  The  recent  restructuring  of  MFEM  provides  an  opportunity  to  strengthen  its  SOE \nmonitoring function, and this will be an integral component of the TA. \n \n11.  While the legal, governance, and monitoring reforms are being developed, a parallel \neffort to update SOE financial accounts will be undertaken, so that those that represent the \ngreatest strain on the budget can be rapidly identified. The outputs of this work will also facilitate \nthe development of necessary baseline indicators for assessing the performance of the TA. \nMFEM will lead this work, with support from the auditor general. Once MFEM identifies priority \nSOEs, at least 4 individual rationalization analyses will be undertaken, resulting in a set of \nrecommendations  on  the  restructuring  of  SOE  operations  and  finances,  including \nrecommendations on any regulatory reforms needed to support the rationalizations.9 \n \n12.  Capacity-building efforts will be built into the TA to support the sustainability of the legal, \ngovernance, and monitoring reforms. At least six training courses on SOE governance and \nmonitoring will be delivered for SOE directors and Ministry of Finance staff, and at least four \ndirector training courses will be offered for SOE directors. The success of the TA will be \ncontingent on continued government support for implementation of the proposed reforms, and \nsufficient resources allocated to MFEM for their implementation.  \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2006.

Manila. \n8  The act will provide a legal framework for the operation, governance, and monitoring of SOEs. Restructuring of \nindividual SOEs may also require amendments of their constituent acts, where these exist. Legal advice will be \nsought to ensure that legal issues are thoroughly considered and the government\u2019s interests are protected in \nrestructuring individual SOEs. \n9  These measures can include corporatization, restructuring, technology enhancements, public\u2013private partnerships, \nprivatization, and liquidation of the SOE or of selected SOE assets. \n ", "4 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $600,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis through the provision of $500,000 by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, \nfunded by the Government of Japan and administered by ADB. The Government of Vanuatu will \nprovide $100,000 to finance office accommodation as well as accounting and auditing fees. \nDetailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB's  Pacific  Liaison  and  Coordination  Office  will  manage  the  TA,  and  coordinate \ndirectly with the Directorate of Finance within MFEM. The directorate has responsibility for SOE \nmonitoring and is expected to serve as the secretariat to the Government Task Force on SOE \nReform  chaired  by  the  minister  of  finance  and  economic  management,  as  per  Council  of \nMinisters Decision 126/2009. MFEM will be both the executing and implementing agency for the \nTA. The TA is expected to commence in October 2010 and be implemented over 23 months. \n \n15.  The Directorate of Finance will be responsible for developing the overall SOE reform \nstrategy and implementation plan, which will include prioritization of SOE reforms. While the TA \nis expected to provide input into formulation of the SOE reform strategy, the focus of ADB\u2019s \ntechnical support during the first phase will be the development of a new SOE act. This work will \nbe conducted in close consultation with MFEM and key stakeholders, including the SOEs, line \nministries, Prime Minister\u2019s Office, State Law Office, and development partners. Subsequent \nphases of the TA will focus on developing individual SOE rationalization plans for the SOEs, as \nagreed jointly with the Directorate of Finance.  \n \n16.  The  TA  team  will  comprise  technical  specialists  with  expertise  in  public\u2013private \npartnership transaction structuring, institutional change, SOE reform, output-based aid, CSOs, \nand public financial management. If required, the TA team will be supported by legal specialists \nfrom  Vanuatu.  Detailed  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  will  be  developed  in  close \ncoordination  with  ADB\u2019s  Central  Operations  Services  Office.  Individual  consultants  will  be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as \namended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with the \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). A \ntotal of 16.5 person-months of international consultant time is expected to be required. Outline \nterms of reference for each output category of the TA are included in Appendix 3. \n \n17.  The Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office will monitor the TA. Good practices and \nlessons will be disseminated through training sessions and workshops, and through TA reports.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to the Government \nof Vanuatu to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for the \nState-Owned Enterprise Rationalization Program, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "Appendix 1  5 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions and Risks \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting   \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nReduced drain on the  Decrease in fiscal  SOE financial  Government commitment \nfiscal position of the  transfers to SOEs  statements to be  to implementing SOE \ngovernment from    prepared with MFEM  reforms is maintained, \nunderperforming public    support  including needed legal \nenterprises      reforms \nReduction in the growth  MFEM financial   \nof contingent liabilities  statements  Risks \ngenerated by SOEs    Political instability derails \nIMF Article IV staff  SOE reforms  \nreports   \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved financial,  Rates of return from  SOE financial  Reliable financial data \noperational and  rationalized SOEs show  statements to be  can be collected for all \ngovernance  improving trend  prepared with MFEM  SOEs to prioritize and \nperformance of SOEs     support  measure impact of \n    reforms \nAverage scores for all  Development of   \npublic enterprises in  necessary baseline   \nannual director  indicators for   \nperformance reviews  assessing TA \nshow improving trend  performance \n   \nMFEM SOE unit \nreports \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.

The required areas of expertise for international experts to be engaged for the technical \nassistance  (TA)  include  public\u2013private  partnership  transaction  structuring;  institutional  change; \nstate-owned enterprise (SOE) reform; output-based aid; community service obligations (CSOs), \ncommercial law, SOE law, SOE monitoring, and public financial management. An outline of the \nbroad terms of reference for each output category follows. More detailed terms of reference will be \nformulated for the recruitment of consultants.  \n \nA.  Output 1: Preparation and Implementation of Rationalization Strategies \n2.  This  output  requires  engaging  international  consultants  for  11.5  person-months.  The \npreparation of rationalization strategies will involve identifying the government's stated objectives \nfor SOEs, followed by a diagnostic assessment of each SOE's service delivery and financial \nperformance  against  these  objectives.  The  diagnostic  will  include  a  review  of  legal,  taxation, \nregulatory, labor, technology, governance, and other relevant issues that affect performance. For \nSOEs  identified  for  divestment,  diagnostic  assessments  will  focus  on  the  market  impacts  of \ndivestment to ensure that consumer welfare is not adversely affected.  \n \n3.  Following  the  diagnostics,  sales  strategies  will  be  developed  for  SOEs  identified  for \ndivestment,  and  rationalization  strategies  will  be  developed  for  SOEs  to  be  retained  under \ngovernment ownership and whose performance will be enhanced. The rationalization strategies \nmay entail financial or operational restructuring, technology enhancements, formalization of CSOs, \ncontracting  out,  and  public\u2013private  partnerships.  Once  the  government  agrees  with  each \nrationalization strategy, the consultants will actively support and participate in their implementation. \n \n4.  This output will require expertise in SOE reform, public\u2013private partnership transaction \nstructuring; contracting of CSOs, privatization transaction structuring, and corporate and financial \nrestructuring. Specific sector expertise may be required depending on the sectors of activity of the \nselected SOEs, for example financial, banking, port management, shipping, and agroprocessing. \nConsultants  should  have  graduate  degrees  in  the  areas  of  focus  and  at  least  15  years  of \nprofessional experience in the selected sectors and areas of technical focus. Experience in the \nPacific will be an advantage. \n \nB.  Output 2: Preparation of a Draft SOE Act \n5.  This output requires engaging international consultants for 2.5 person-months. To prepare \nthe  new  SOE  act,  the  consultants  will  first conduct  a  review  of  (i)  the  legislative  and  policy \nframework for SOEs, (ii) the organization of their ownership and monitoring functions, (iii) the \ncapacity  of  the  institutions  charged  with  the  monitoring  functions,  (iv)  the  adequacy  of  the \naccounting and financial reporting regime, and (v) the degree of management independence of the \nSOEs. This assessment should determine what actions, if any, are needed to improve the ability of \nthe SOEs to operate as commercial entities as well as the ability of the government to monitor their \nperformance and exercise its rights as shareholder. The consultants will then draft an SOE act and \nnecessary amendments to associated legislation, for review and discussion with the Government \nand relevant stakeholders. The consultants will also organize stakeholder consultation sessions on \nthe new law and support the introduction of the draft law to Parliament.  \n \n6.  The output will require expertise in commercial law, SOE law, corporate governance, public \nfinancial management, the Vanuatu legal framework and legislative drafting. Once finalized, the \n ", "Appendix 3  9 \n \ndraft law will be translated into French, requiring input from a specialist translator. Consultants \nshould have a law degree and hands-on experience developing and implementing SOE legislation, \npreferably in the Pacific region.  \n \nC.  Output 3: Training courses on SOE Governance and Monitoring  \n7.  This  output  requires  engaging  an  international  consultant  for  1  person-month.  The \nconsultant will deliver training courses on the roles and responsibilities of directors (including the \nprovisions of the new SOE law), SOE reporting and monitoring processes, board structure and \nappointment processes, the formation of audit committees and establishment of statements of \ncorporate intent. It is anticipated that the consultants delivering this training will also be involved in \noutputs 2 above and 4 below. The consultant should have a graduate degree and at least 15 years \nof experience working with SOE governance issues. Experience in the Pacific will be an advantage. \n \nD.  Output 4: Development and implementation of a director performance evaluation \nsystem  \n8.  This  output  requires  engaging  an  international  consultant  for  1.5  person-months.  The \nconsultant will provide technical assistance to the SOEs and SOE monitoring units to develop a \ndirector performance evaluation system. The system will be anchored in the provisions of the new \nlegal framework, and will reflect international best practice. It will be intended to strengthen the \naccountability mechanisms and duties and responsibilities of directors as outlined in the Company \nLaw and new SOE act. The consultant will conduct a series of consultation sessions with SOE \nboards to develop the system, followed by implementation assistance to support the piloting of the \nnew system.  \n \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20100902143039+10'00'", "Author": "mmd", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2.2", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20100902143039+10'00'", "Title": "Microsoft Word - TA VAN SOE Rationaliztion Prog_1Sep2010"}, "author_page": " \nCURRENCY EQUIVALENTS \n(as of 24 August 2010) \nCurrency Unit \u2013  vatu (Vt) \nVt1.00 =  $0.0098 \n$1.00 =  Vt102.1 \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  CSO  \u2013  community service obligation \n  MFEM  \u2013  Ministry of Finance and Economic Management \n  SOE  \u2013  state-owned enterprise \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nType  \u2013  Policy and advisory technical assistance (PATA) \nTargeting classification  \u2013  General intervention  \nSector (subsector)  \u2013  Public sector management (economic management and \nmanagement of public affairs) \nThemes (subthemes)  \u2013  Economic growth (promoting economic efficiency and enabling \nbusiness environment), governance (economic and financial \ngovernance), and private sector development (privatization),  \nLocation impact  \u2013  National (high), regional (low), urban (medium), rural (low) \nPartnership  \u2013  Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \"$\" refers to US dollars. \n \nVice-President  C.
