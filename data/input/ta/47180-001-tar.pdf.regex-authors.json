Viet Nam is one of the 10 most biologically diverse countries in the world, possessing \nnatural  ecosystems  from  tropical  jungles  to  dry  forests,  mountains,  wetlands,  and  marine \necosystems. 1 Recognizing that these ecosystems are essential to human life, the government \nadvanced a policy framework to assign values to ecosystem services and to enable payments \nfor forest environmental services (PFES) to be collected and disbursed to resource managers. 2  \nPayments from forest environmental service users in Viet Nam accrue to national and provincial \nforest protection funds. To ensure revenues are used for their intended purpose, sustainable \nforestry  and  livelihood  development,  they  must  be  integrated  into  provincial  and  national \nsocioeconomic  development  planning.  The  government  has  requested  Asian  Development \nBank (ADB) support to improve the implementation of PFES schemes.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Viet Nam was one of the first countries to pilot a PFES scheme that mandates payments \nat the national level. The government issued Decision 380 in 2008, assigning to the Ministry of \nAgriculture and Rural Development (MARD) responsibility for overseeing the management of \npayments. Decree 05 in January 2008 established forest protection and development funds \n(FPDFs) as the provincial-level financial mechanism for PFES payments. With these decisions \nin place, studies were carried out to determine payment levels for environmental services based \non a valuation of the service provided and willingness to pay. Later that year, with assistance \nfrom the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), pilot payments were \nsuccessfully made to households for protecting forests in Lam Dong Province, because this \nservice enhances water regulation, thereby contributing to the sustainability of the operations of \nhydropower and water supply companies. Viet Nam\u2019s Decree 99/2010, issued in January 2010 \nmandates  nationwide  application  of    PFES  schemes  for  the  following  services:  (i)  soil \nconservation, reduction of erosion, protection against sedimentation of reservoirs and river beds, \n(ii) regulation and maintenance of water supply for production and social life, (iii) absorption and \nstorage of carbon, (iv) protection of the natural landscape of forest ecological systems for \ntourism purposes, and (v) provision of breeding grounds, food supply, and water resources \nnecessary for aquaculture. The first three services have been legally assigned values in the \ndecree. MARD is planning to assign values for the latter two services in 2013\u20132014 and has \nrequested support to develop the necessary regulations. \n \n3.  Managing  and  distributing  payments.  Under Decree 99, MARD collected D1,172 \nbillion in 2012 from more than 80 hydropower, water supply, and ecotourism operators. FPDFs \nhave been established in 22 provinces, and province level PFES steering committees have \nbeen established in 35 provinces to manage these funds. The Central Forest Protection and \nDevelopment Fund transferred 99.5% of the PFES revenues collected in 2012 to provinces but, \nof that amount, only 50% was distributed to households managing forest resources. Distributing \npayments in cases where individual households are forest owners is proving difficult, because \nthe government uses on-the-ground forest inventories to determine household payment levels, \nand enters into individual contracts with household forest managers.  \n \n                                                \n1   IUCN Viet Nam. Fact Sheet. Accessed 22 May 2013.   \nhttp://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/iucn_fact_sheet_20112008.pdf  \n2  The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (www.maweb.org) defined ecosystem services as the benefits people \nderive from ecosystems, including actual or potential benefits. Each ecosystem will provide different services, with \nsome generating higher levels of services than others. \n3   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 December 2013.    \n ", "2   \n \n4.  To  improve  PFES  contract  management,  ADB  piloted  a  new  approach  to  PFES \ndistribution and monitoring in Quang Nam Province under the TA subproject for Support for the \nNational  Roll  Out  of  Payment  for  Forest  Environmental  Services  and  Benefit  Sharing \nMechanisms in Viet Nam.4 Two innovations were applied in five villages in Ma Cooil Commune: \n(i) a group approach to forest patrolling and fund management, and (ii) the use of satellite data \nto determine forest ownership and payment levels, and monitor forest management efforts. In \nthe pilot villages, each PFES group carries out regular forest monitoring and manages its own \nPFES payments, setting aside 30% of the group\u2019s funds to support livelihood activities. PFES \ngroups track expenditures in logbooks and manage micro-livelihood activity loans. PFES groups \nalso keep a log of their forest monitoring efforts and are periodically checked by the forest \nmanagement units managed by the District Agriculture and Rural Development Agency. In the \nsame  pilot  villages,  geographic  information  system  maps  are  used  to  establish  forest \nboundaries  and  forest  quality,  as  well  as  track  forest  management.  The  village-level  pilot \nprojects are viewed as successful by provincial and national authorities, which have requested \nADB  to  increase  its  support  by  (i)  streamlining  the  regulatory  framework  for  PFES \nimplementation, including the group approach to forest patrolling and PFES management, (ii) \nimproving transparency in payment systems, and (iii) establishing a robust monitoring and \nevaluation framework for PFES implementation using satellite data. When fully operationalized, \nthe low cost of this new approach will allow provincial authorities to map PFES levels, monitor \nenvironmental  service  provision,  and  administer  payments  with  the  resources  provided  for \nmanagement under Decree 99.  \n \n5.  Capacity  gaps.  Moving  beyond  provincial  implementation  issues,  a  deeper \nunderstanding  of  payments  for  environmental  services  is  required  in  order  to  mainstream \nresource  accounting  in  development  planning.  This  will  necessitate  a  broader  range  of \necosystem services and, as indicated in Decree 99, a shared methodology and approach to the \nintegration of ecosystem services in provincial and national economic planning. In particular, it is \ncritical that MARD and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) cooperate \nto synchronize land use planning and forest master planning, including ecosystem services \naccounting. Barriers to the integration of ecosystem service values include: (i)  the lack of \ncomprehensive and easily accessible information on environmental resources and economic \ndata; (ii) the absence of guidance for integrated and interdisciplinary planning; (iii) the limited \nknowledge and capacity of government officers to adopt and implement the integrated approach \nto the management of ecosystem services; and (iv) a lack of institutional capacity to implement \nintegrated and interdisciplinary ecosystem management methods. Furthermore, it is not clear \nhow  men and  women participate  in  the  provision  of  forest  services  and  how  benefits  are \ndistributed among household members.  \n \n6.  Lessons. A number of related ADB and development partner projects are supporting \nanalysis  of  the  overall  value  of  ecosystem  services.  These  include  ADB\u2019s  Biodiversity \nConservation Corridors Loan in Quang Nam, Quang Tri, and Thua Thien Hue; GIZ\u2019s support for \necosystem service payment systems in Son La; United Nations Development Programme\u2019s \nsupport for valuing mangrove ecosystem services in Ca Mau; United Nations Convention to \nCombat Desertification\u2500Global Mechanism\u2019s support for valuation of ecosystem services in \nQuang Nam; and USAID\u2019s support for PFES in Lam Dong, Nghe An, and Thanh Hoa. While \nthese initiatives support improved livelihoods and forest conservation in target communes, no \nassistance program has achieved province-wide PFES application. A recent USAID-sponsored \nstudy found that provincial distribution schemes vary, with the largest payments being made at \n                                                \n4  Subproject under ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Mainstreaming Environment for Poverty Reduction. Manila \n(TA 6422-REG).  \n ", "             3  \nthe village level and the smallest at the household level. A review of the 20 legal documents \nissued to regulate PFES found that none provides consistent guidance to provincial authorities \non fund distribution or evaluation of forest conditions (i.e., the key measures of the effectiveness \nof a PFES scheme). The study recommends (i) greater outcome level accountability at the \nvillage, provincial, and national levels in order to improve the PFES scheme, and (ii) scaling up \nthe approach piloted in ADB\u2019s ongoing assistance in Quang Nam. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact of the technical assistance (TA) is that ecosystem service payments will \nimprove rural livelihoods and environmental quality in the three target provinces by 2020. The \noutcome of the TA is that the assessment, collection, and disbursement of ecosystem service \nvalues and payments in the three target provinces will follow a consistent approach by 2016. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  To achieve the outcome, the TA will support analytical studies, pilot demonstrations of \npayment and accounting systems, policy development, knowledge management, and capacity \nbuilding. The TA has four main outputs:  \n \n9.  Output 1: Economic evaluation of environmental services will be standardized at \nthe provincial level. The TA will analyze the valuation and pricing of environmental services in \nViet Nam compared to other developing countries in the region (India, People\u2019s Republic of \nChina) and outside the region (Costa Rica, Ecuador, Kenya) through a desk study. The TA will \nthen carry out pilot projects to collect PFES for aquaculture and forest carbon. Building on this \nwork, the TA will produce a roadmap for integration of potential additional values in national and \nprovincial socioeconomic development planning, including the use of decision support tools. To \nsupport provincial level implementation, the TA will also develop an assessment of management \noptions for provincial level socioeconomic development planning and sector master planning. \n \n10.  Output 2: Mechanisms for PFES valuation, management, and distribution will be \npiloted and institutionalized. The TA will produce a gender-sensitive streamlined regulatory \nframework for forest patrolling and PFES management, including guidelines for (a) integration of \necosystem service values into provincial level planning and budgeting cycles, (b) transparent \naccounting of PFES collection and benefit distribution, and (c) monitoring and evaluation of \nPFES implementation using geographic information systems for integration with existing forest \ninventory and land use planning efforts. The streamlined guidelines will be approved for testing \nby the provincial authorities and pilot tested in three provinces. Policy guidelines will then be \nrevised and approved for issuance as a circular at the national level. To ensure that the forestry \ninformation used by the TA is consistent with government procedures and available to decision \nmakers, the TA will use the Development of Management Information System for Forestry \nSector Phase II (FORMIS) platform for data management. 5  \n \n                                                \n5  The FORMIS Project is financed by the Government of Finland with the overall objective of building a modern \nforest information system from central to local level, in order to provide accurate information for decision making in \nthe forestry sector at all levels. The first phase has developed an IT system capable of managing all forest\u2500related \ndata on a common platform managed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Viet Nam Forest, and \npiloted a forest inventory in three provinces using the system. The second phase (2013\u20132018) will expand the \nsystem to all provinces with a budget of \u20ac10 million. http://formisvietnam.com/home  \n ", "4   \n \n11.  Output 3: National and provincial policymakers will have the capacity to value \necosystem services and integrate them into economic development planning. A gender-\nsensitive impact assessment of PFES pilot schemes and an institutional mapping exercise and \nbaseline survey of the capacity needs of target policy makers and stakeholders will be carried \nout so as to build support for implementation of the improved PFES approach. Results of the \nmapping and capacity assessment will be used to develop a female-friendly capacity action plan, \nand a PFES \u201cchampions network\u201d will be set up. The network\u2019s activities will include a training \nprogram, under which 50 people at the national level and in target provinces will be trained as \ntrainers to support the revised regulatory framework for PFES implementation. The training will \nfocus on (i) integrating ecosystem service values into provincial level planning and budgeting \nexercises, (ii) applying transparent PFES accounting systems, and (iii) setting up monitoring and \nevaluation systems that integrate satellite information with existing land use planning and forest \nmonitoring  systems.  Using  the  champions  network,  capacity  development  workshops  for \nnational  and  provincial  authorities  (FPDFs,  commune  people\u2019s  committees,  departments of \nagriculture and rural development and departments of natural resources and environment, and \nothers) will be held to train 500 participants, 40% of which will be female. A final capacity \nassessment will be completed by the end of 2015.  \n \n12.  Output 4: Best practices and lessons will be captured and shared. Viet Nam is a \nleader in PFES implementation. To enable it to continue to build national and regional capacity, \na communications and knowledge management plan will be developed.  Based on output 3, the \nTA will produce learning modules for dissemination in local languages and a summary of best \npractices will be drafted and disseminated through the Greater Mekong Subregion Environment \nOperations  Center  and  other  regional  environment  networks.  Lessons  learned  will  be \nincorporated into the Greater Mekong Subregion Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Project \n(BCC) activities for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Cambodia, and Viet \nNam.6 Vietnamese  officials  will  offer  guidance  on  PFES  for  hydropower  projects  and  on \nmechanisms for PFES valuation management and distribution in the Lao PDR.7 Final print and \nmultimedia reports will be disseminated in English and local languages by end-January 2016. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,650,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office accommodation, transport, \ndata, administrative support, and other in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing \ntable are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.   The TA will be implemented between May 2014 and April 2016. The lead implementing \nagency will be the Vietnam Forest Protection and Development Fund (VNFF) under the Ministry \nof  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (MARD).  8  Upon  TA  approval,  a  central  project \n                                                \n6   ADB. 2010. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Loan and Grants to \nthe Kingdom of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Greater \nMekong Subregion Biodiversity Conservation Corridors Project. Manila (loan effective in Viet Nam as of May 2011). \n7  Potential cooperation under the Forest Investment Program, which is funded by the Climate Investment Funds, will \nbe explored, particularly for hydropower projects in the Forest Investment Program watershed in Southern Lao \nPDR where hydropower and irrigation projects are being identified in the BCC project area.  \n8  VNFF, MARD will be the lead implementing agency according to ADB policy and \u201cproject owner\u201d according to \nGovernment of Viet Nam policy.  \n ", "             5  \nmanagement unit will be established under VNFF to support the agency in TA implementation.9  \nAt the provincial level, FPDF will be the lead implementation unit, reporting to VNFF and the \nProvincial People\u2019s Committee. Upon TA approval a provincial project management unit under \nthe FPDF will be set up in each target province.10  A technical steering committee, chaired by \ndirector, VNFF will be set up and include representatives from MARD, MONRE, the Ministry of \nPlanning and Investment, and the people\u2019s committees and FPDFs of the target provinces.11 \n \n15.   The project consists of four distinct outputs, and supporting activities will be executed by \na firm that will be under the quality- and cost-based selection process, with a quality\u2013cost ratio \nof 80:20. It is estimated that 10 person-months of international consultant services and 142 \nperson-months of national consultant services will be required. Consultants will be recruited in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to \ntime),  and  disbursements  under  the TA  will  be  done  in  accordance with  ADB\u2019s  Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The detailed terms \nof reference are in Appendix 3. The firm to be recruited will also be responsible for delivering \ntraining programs and procuring equipment.  \n \n16.    ADB will collaborate with ongoing development partner initiatives. The Development of \nManagement  Information  System  for  Forestry  Sector  Phase  II  platform  (FORMIS)  is  the \npreferred vehicle for the management of data, knowledge, and outreach materials produced by \nthe project. ADB is coordinating with GIZ to pilot PFES for aquaculture. The TA will also partner \nwith Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency and Japan International Cooperation Agency  to \npromote the use of satellite data for forest monitoring.12 Coordination with the World Bank\u2019s \nWealth  Accounting  and  the  Valuation  of  Ecosystem  Services  Program  will  ensure  the  TA \noutputs are consistent with the roadmap for natural resource accounting in the forest sector \nunder development for the national level. ADB, VNFF, and consultants will seek to strengthen \ncooperation with these development partners by sharing knowledge through joint workshops, \ntraining events, and publications. Furthermore, ADB will circulate milestone reports to the Forest \nSector Support Partnership, the international development coordination body for the sector. \n \n17.    A  dissemination  plan,  integrating  communications  and  knowledge  management \napproaches,  will  be  developed  as  part  of  output  4.  Progress  will  be  monitored  using  the \nintended outcomes and outputs described in the design and monitoring framework in Appendix \n1. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.    The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,500,000  to  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction for Improving Payment for Forest Ecosystem Service Implementation, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board.  \n                                                \n9  Individual outputs are assigned by agency as discussed during the fact-finding mission and defined in the design \nand monitoring framework (Appendix 1). \n10 Coordination between the provincial offices for this TA project and the project management unit of the BCC Project \n(Biodiversity Conservation Agency and departments of natural resources and environment) will be carried out \nthrough a shared monitoring framework for biodiversity conservation and sustainable livelihood activities, and \napplied by Provincial Project Management Unit staff.   \n11 Target provinces will be identified through a readiness criteria jointly developed by ADB and MARD. \n12 All partners listed have agreed informally (by e-mail) to collaborate in implementing this TA. At a minimum, they will \nshare technical reports on a quarterly basis. Upon TA approval, more formal agreements (e.g., a memorandum of \nunderstanding) will be considered if advantageous to both parties.  \n ", "6           Appendix 1     \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \n \nPerformance Targets  Data Sources and \nDesign  Assumptions and \nand Indicators with  Reporting \nSummary  Risks \nBaselines  Mechanisms \nImpact  The number of eligible  Review of SEDP and  Assumption \nEcosystem service  families receiving PFES  provincial development  There is political will to \npayments improve rural  payments for completing  plans 2020\u20132025  integrate ecosystem \nlivelihoods and  forest monitoring work    service valuation \nenvironmental quality in  increases from below  Review of DARD  approaches in \nthe 3 target provinces by  20% to over 50% in the  inventory  planning and reporting \n2020  target provinces     systems. \n \nOutcome  By 2016, the 3 target  Provincial Forest  Assumption \nEcosystem service  provinces are applying  Protection and  Inter-ministerial \nvalues and payments  consistent accounting,  Development Fund  coordination promotes \nassessed, collected, and  transfer and payment  annual reports    mainstreaming in \ndisbursed following a  mechanisms to forest  economic planning \nconsistent approach in  owners    \nthe 3 target provinces by  Risk \n2016.
