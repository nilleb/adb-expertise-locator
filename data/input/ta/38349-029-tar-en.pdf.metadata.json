Nepal is a landlocked country of tremendous geographic diversity, with the northern rim \nof the Gangetic Plain in the south, the Himalaya Mountains in the north, and rugged and hilly \nterrain  in  between.  Civil  aviation  is  crucial  to  transport,  trade,  and  tourism,  and  provides \nindispensable links to hilly and mountainous areas that are inaccessible by other transport modes. \nTourism is one of the major economic activities in Nepal and a top government priority. It is \nestimated that tourism brought in $651 million in foreign exchange in fiscal year 2019, equivalent \nto 65% of goods exports.1 Travel and tourism in Nepal generated an estimated $1.92 billion \n(7.8% of  gross  domestic  product)  in  2018,  including  indirect  and  induced  contributions.2 \nConsidering that more than 80% of international tourists come to Nepal by air, improvement of \nthe civil aviation sector is essential for tourism to flourish and to support the country\u2019s economic \ndevelopment. \n \n2.  Aviation safety in Nepal is a challenge for the civil aviation sector. The Universal Safety \nOversight  Audit  Programme  under  the  International  Civil  Aviation  Organization  (ICAO)  is \nresponsible for conducting aviation safety oversight audits to identify deficiencies of its member \nstates.  The  Civil  Aviation  Authority  of  Nepal  (CAAN)  has  achieved  significant  progress  in \nimproving its safety oversight capability, which was evident in the Universal Safety Oversight Audit \nProgramme\u2019s 2017 audit of the CAAN. Nonetheless, negative safety oversight margins were still \nidentified in (i) air navigation; and (ii) support in organization, legislation, and accident and incident \ninvestigation.3 Nepal has maintained a traditional civil aviation sector structure whereby the \nfunctions of regulation, safety oversight, and service provision are carried out by one entity: CAAN. \nThe roles of regulator and service provider lodged in a single organization create a conflict of \ninterest. The regulatory function may not provide adequate oversight on service provision and \nmay raise operating costs, resulting in suboptimal performance as a service provider. There are \nalso repercussions on aviation safety, which have been noted and highlighted by international \naviation agencies. ICAO\u2019s Global Aviation Safety Plan, 2020\u20132022 states that an independent \nregulatory authority should be established and maintained, which includes separation of oversight \nfunctions from service provision functions where these exist within the authority.4 The European \nCommission has banned Nepalese airlines from flying to the European Union because of a lack \nof safety oversight by the aviation authority of Nepal.5 To remedy this situation, the government \nis enacting new civil aviation legislation. \n \n3.  The  program  will  provide  budget  support  for  civil  aviation  sector  reforms  in  the \nrestructuring of the current CAAN and the strengthening of its oversight functions, management \naccountability,  and  operational  efficiency.  The  Government  of  Nepal  has  requested  a \nconcessional loan of $50  million equivalent from the ordinary capital resources of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to help finance the program, which will be released in two tranches\u2014\n$25 million at loan effectiveness, and $25 million about 24 months later\u2014once the government \nhas complied with the policy actions. \n \n \n \n1  International Monetary Fund (IMF). 2020.

The proposed transaction technical assistance (TA) is being processed at the request of \nthe Government of Nepal to facilitate program implementation. Since the proposed policy-based \nloan is the first in the civil aviation sector in Nepal, there is a strong need to assist the implementing \nagencies in carrying out required actions under the policy-based loan. \n  \n5.  The policy actions in tranche 2 include several initiatives that are relatively new to the \nCAAN and its management.6 These initiatives intend to transform the newly established entities, \nparticularly the Air Service Authority of Nepal (ASAN) as a service provider, to be more advanced \nand  forward-looking  organizations  in  terms  of  management  accountability  and  operational \nefficiency. This includes preparation of a medium-term business plan, preparation of a financial \nframework, preparation of a financial management improvement plan including the introduction \nof  accrual-based  financial  statements  and  an  enterprise  resource  planning  system,  and \ndevelopment of key performance indicators. There are also pressing needs in the global civil \naviation sector to advance gender equality and social inclusion (GESI), and the empowerment of \nwomen. ICAO made commitments, in Resolution A39-30: ICAO Gender Equality Programme \nPromoting Participation of Women in the Global Aviation Sector, to enhance gender equality by \n2030 at all professional and higher levels of employment in the sector. In line with global trends \nand international practices, GESI initiatives are included in tranche 2 policy actions, which will be \nassisted by the TA. The TA will support the implementing agencies to prepare the policy actions \nin these areas to comply with the program\u2019s tranche 2 conditions.7 \n \n6.  The TA will provide assistance in facilitating and monitoring progress of policy actions. \nSuccessfully implementing civil aviation reforms relies on communicating organizational changes, \nreform objectives, and benefits with all stakeholders, including CAAN employees. Effective \ncommunication strategies are critical for enhancing results. Monitoring and facilitating progress of \npolicy actions\u2014especially those related to compliance with highly technical requirements based \non ICAO standards and practices\u2014are important to provide timely technical support during \nimplementation. \n \nB.

Cost and Financing \n \n8.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-6). The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 1. \n \n9.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, and other in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n10.  ADB will administer the TA. A total of 10.5 person-months of international and 23 person-\nmonths of national consultancy inputs will be required intermittently. Transaction TA consultants \nwill provide support to the proposed implementing agencies for the program.
