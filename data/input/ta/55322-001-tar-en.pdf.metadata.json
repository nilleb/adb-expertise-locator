THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY\nA. Justification\n1. The transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will cofinance feasibility and market\nstudies to support nonsovereign operations in the Pacific developing member countries (DMCs)\nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB). ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD)\nhas identified a pipeline of 10\u201315 projects for potential debt financing or equity investments in the\nregion. However, the projects require feasibility studies to assess and confirm they are viable\nopportunities for PSOD. As project sponsors lack the immediate financial resources to prepare\nthe studies, the TA will cofinance feasibility studies alongside project sponsors, on a reimbursable\nbasis (para 5). The ensuing projects are in multiple sectors, in line with PSOD\u2019s investment\npriorities for the region (para 4), and all require similar support. The TA will also prepare market\nstudies to assess risks and opportunities in sectors that can potentially promote further private\nsector growth in the region. The TA leverages the One ADB approach\u2014drawing on resources\nfrom ADB\u2019s Pacific Department (PARD) to support deeper involvement of PSOD in the region.\n2. Barriers to nonsovereign sector operations in the Pacific. All 14 of the Pacific DMCs\nare small island developing states (SIDS), and seven of them are classified as fragile or conflict-\naffected situations (FCAS).1 The cost of doing business in FCAS and SIDS is higher than normal,\nthe markets are small, and credit risks are high. Further, business environments in the Pacific\nDMCs are underdeveloped, capacity shortages affect both the public and private sectors, and\nthere is a lack of infrastructure and services needed to support private sector growth. Additionally,\nbusinesses are constrained by (i) limited access to regional and international markets, (ii) weak\nimplementation of business laws, and (iii) constrained access to financial services. Low risk-\nadjusted returns often do not meet the requirements to be considered for ADB\u2019s nonsovereign\noperations or other private financing without a high level of development partner support. As a\nresult, ADB has not historically been able to identify opportunities to invest in private sector\ninitiatives in FCAS and SIDS, and the Pacific DMCs face exceptionally low levels of private sector\nparticipation. Even pre-pandemic public expenditure was a relatively large part of the Pacific\neconomies,  averaging  58%  of  gross  domestic  product  across  the  12  small  Pacific  island\ncountries 2  economies.  Increasing  private  sector  participation,  including  through  ADB\u2019s\nnonsovereign operations, is essential to economic growth, infrastructure development, and the\nsustainability of development impacts across the region.\n3. ADB\u2019s commitment to nonsovereign operations. In Strategy 2030, ADB makes a\nnumber of commitments to FCAS and SIDS. These include prioritizing support for the poorest\nand most vulnerable countries in the region, including FCAS and SIDS; augmenting resources to\naccommodate  the  added  costs  of  identifying,  processing,  and  implementing  projects  and\ninvestments in these countries; and pursuing development impacts as the key objective of its\nprivate sector operations. Strategy 2030 states that \u201cADB will expand its private sector operations\nin new and frontier markets, including challenging markets such as FCAS and SIDS. In the\nprocess, ADB will consider smaller deal sizes with potentially higher risk and development\nimpacts, including inclusive business models.\u201d Following the 13th replenishment of the Asian\n1  ADB\u2019s 14 Pacific DMCs comprise the Cook Islands, Fiji, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands (RMI), the Federated States of \nMicronesia (FSM), Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \nThe seven Pacific countries classified as FCAS are FSM, Kiribati, RMI, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands \nand Tuvalu.  \n2  The 12 small Pacific island countries comprise the Cook Islands, the FSM, Kiribati, the RMI, Nauru, Niue, Palau, \nSamoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Niue is the newest ADB member, having joined in 2019.  ", "2 \nDevelopment Fund (ADF-13), ADB established the private sector window (PSW) to address and \nreduce common financing constraints that hinder private sector transactions in group A countries. \nThe PSW notes that \u201cUpstream development work remains critical to unlocking PSO [private \nsector operations], particularly in challenging markets, and ADB will continue to allocate TA \nresources to group A countries, in particular FCAS and SIDS, for thematic areas that include \nprivate sector development.\u201d3 The TA will focus on projects in the 14 Pacific DMCs, with a \nparticular priority for a subset of the nine Group A countries, and on supporting projects in sectors \nthat are aligned with both PSOD and PSW priorities.4 The TA will support PSOD in identifying \nbankable projects in the Pacific DMCs and building project readiness for PSW financing.  \n4. The ensuing projects. In 2018, PSOD undertook a strategic review of nonsovereign\nopportunities in the Pacific and identified four priority target sectors: (i) financial institutions and\ntrade finance, including commercial banks, microfinance, and insurance; (ii) renewable energy\ngeneration; (iii) agribusiness, including a particular focus on fisheries, an important sector for\nmany Pacific DMCs; (iv) tourism and related infrastructure including hotels, which is an important\nsector for many Pacific DMCs. The TA may also consider projects in the health and education\nsectors because of their ability to provide catalytic support to socioeconomic development. The\ntarget  sectors  are  aligned  with  priority  areas  identified  by  PSW,  which  include  tourism,\nagribusiness and fisheries, and financial services that support lending to women and small- and\nmedium-sized enterprises. PARD and PSOD have since collaborated to establish a pipeline of\nprojects for nonsovereign lending in the target sectors. PARD has leveraged its field presence\nthrough the Pacific country offices to identify opportunities, and PSOD has conducted preliminary\nassessments and interviews and identified 10\u201315 potential projects. However, momentum will\nstall if pipeline project sponsors do not have access to financial and technical support in preparing\nfeasibility  studies.  Further  assistance  is  also  required  to  assess  downstream  risks  and\nopportunities in the target sectors. The TA will fund the preparation of professional feasibility\nstudies that enable ADB to act on near-term nonsovereign investment opportunities, while also\nfunding market studies to identify longer term opportunities aligned with PSOD and PSW priorities\nfor the region.\nB. Outputs and Activities\n5. Output 1: Feasibility studies prepared. The TA will cofinance up to 75% of the costs of\nfeasibility studies, alongside project sponsors. The percentage of TA contributions for each study\nwill vary based on the financial capacity of the project sponsors and the size of the potential\nproject. The feasibility studies will be for projects aligned with PSOD\u2019s priority sectors for the\nregion, PSW priority areas, and with a focus on countries eligible for ADF-13 assistance (para 3).\nPSOD will select the projects based on the quality and experience of the project sponsors, the\nextent and positive conclusions of the initial pre-feasibility study work, and the likelihood of the\nproject\u2019s long-term operational and financial success, and development impact. The TA will not\nfinance experimental projects or investments in unproven or undemonstrated technologies.5\nProject sponsors will reimburse ADB\u2019s TA-funded costs if the respective feasibility study is\npositive, and the project sponsors are subsequently successful in raising the capital necessary to\n3  ADB. 2020.

The TA will prepare a minimum of three feasibility studies.  \n6. Output 2: Market studies prepared. The TA will finance market studies by recognized\nand reputable experts in subsectors that have growth potential and are aligned with PSOD and\nPSW priorities. The market studies will support ADB and the private sector to assess risks and\nopportunities in priority sectors, such as agribusiness, fisheries, and tourism. Whereas feasibility\nstudies under output 1 focus on individual projects with a comparably high degree of readiness,\nmarket studies under output 2 will focus on evaluating markets that may present opportunities for\nfuture individual developments. The market studies will be delivered to ADB in digital format. The\nTA will prepare a minimum of three market studies.\nC. Cost and Financing\n7. The TA facility is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by\nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($1,000,000 TASF-other sources and $500,000 TASF-\n7). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The TA facility will be subject to\narrangements that will seek partial recovery of the amount financed under the TA facility. Activities\nunder output 1 will seek full recovery of the amount financed under the TA if the project\u2019s sponsors\nare able to raise the necessary capital to implement the ensuing project. Activities under output 2\nare not subject to recovery as the market reports may benefit and be released to a number of\nparties, including relevant government entities and all market participants. Project sponsors will\nbe informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n8. ADB will administer the TA, and disbursement of the TA resources will follow ADB\u2019s\nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2020, as amended from time to time). PARD and\nPSOD will jointly administer the TA. The TA does not require logistical support from the DMCs.\nAny necessary logistical support will be provided by the Pacific country offices. As TA resources\nare repaid by project sponsors, ADB may consider replenishing the TA to allow it to finance\nadditional studies if and as appropriate. The TA duration will be 60 months, from December 2021\nto November 2026.\n9. The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table.\nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative  December 2021\u2013November 2026 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agency  ADB \nImplementing agencies  PSOD  and  PARD  will  administer  the  TA.

Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement\nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated staff instructions.7 There is a very\nlimited number of appropriately qualified firms with relevant experience to conduct feasibility study\nwork in the Pacific DMCs, now compounded by limited access due to the coronavirus pandemic\n(COVID-19). For this reason and due to the highly specialized nature of the assignments under\nthis TRTA, ADB will recruit consultants via any of the six methods of selection following discussion\nwith PPFD. Before seeking a proposal from the firms selected following DC, PARD\u2019s Office of the\nDirector General will seek the approval of the Procurement, Portfolio and Financial Management\nDepartment as mandated by the relevant Staff Instructions.\nE. Governance\n11. ADB will conduct integrity due diligence on project sponsors, the board of directors,\nshareholders, and managers, to confirm in advance that they are not the subject of any unresolved\nor substantiated adverse media or other relevant information that may pose significant integrity\nrisk.8 ADB\u2019s review of these entities should also confirm that there is no cause to believe that\nthese have been established or are being used for money laundering or terrorism financing.\nProject sponsors should have some record of developing similar projects as envisaged under the\nTA.\n7  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  ADB. 2003.Enhancing the ADB\u2019s Role in Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism.
