The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested technical \nassistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in reforming policies and developing \nplans to improve rural transport services to supplement the ongoing rural roads development \nprogram. The TA1 is included in ADB\u2019s country strategy and program update (2006\u20132008),2 and \nwas confirmed by the Government during ADB\u2019s 2006 Country Programming Mission. The Fact-\nFinding Mission (the Mission) was undertaken in March 2006 to formulate the TA. The Mission \nreached agreement with the Government on the TA objectives, scope, cost estimate, financing \nplan,  implementation  arrangements,  and  terms  of  reference.  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  country\u2019s  sustained  economic  growth  over  the  last  two  decades  has  been \naccompanied  by  a  large  demand  for  transport.  This has resulted  in rapid  development  of \ntransport infrastructure, and particularly of roads. During 1990 to 2005, the road traffic grew by \n9% for passenger reaching 929 billion passenger-kilometer, and 6% for freight reaching 869 \nbillion ton-km. According to the Ministry of Communications (MOC), the road network expanded \nto about 1.93 million km in 2005.3 Rural roads include county and township roads (which are \nincluded in the above network), as well as a large number of village roads.4 The estimate for \nrural roads vary between 1.5 million km to 3.0 million km.      \n \n3.  The Government is focusing on rural development in an effort to reduce poverty, which \nis more prevalent in rural areas. Development in rural areas will help bridge the rural\u2013urban \ndivide, and create employment opportunities that will assist in curbing migration and controlling \nrapid urbanization.5 As part of this effort, the Government has specifically allocated resources \nfor rural roads, as they play a significant role in fostering social and economic integration of the \ncountry and reducing poverty. By connecting rural areas to the existing road network, rural \nroads raise the productivity of poor households, help diversify income sources, and facilitate \naccess to social services. Accordingly, MOC has prepared a multi-stage national rural road \ndevelopment program, involving construction and improvement of rural roads and expansion of \ntransport services. The Government\u2019s 11th five-year plan (FYP), 2006\u20132010, calls for linking the \npaved road network with (i) all townships and villages in the eastern region, (ii) all townships \nand 88% of villages in the central region, and (iii) 90% townships and 50% villages in the \nwestern region. The Government estimates that 2.4 million km of rural roads will be constructed \nor improved to achieve these targets. The Government plans to invest about CNY140 billion, \nand will seek additional financing from other sources.      \n \n4.  The Government realizes that the benefits of improving rural roads will not be realized \nunless  road  transport  services  are  also  improved.  At  present,  the  capacity  and  quality  of \ntransport services in rural areas is very low. Provision of reliable, efficient, and affordable \ntransport services is crucial for improvement of rural economic conditions. Efficient transport \nservices will allow the rural population to access competitive markets, as well as needed health, \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 April 2006. \n2  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008): People\u2019s Republic of China. Manila.  \n3  This figure is based on the MOC database and includes expressways (41,000 km); class I\u2013IV highways (1,550,000 \nkm); and unclassified roads (339,000 km).  \n4  These are largely unpaved roads that do not fall within the standard design categories, and hence are not reflected \nin the MOC statistics. \n5   The urban population grew by 81% from 2000 to 2005. \n ", "2 \neducation, and other social services. Consequently, under the 11th FYP the Government gives \npriority  to  the  development  of  rural  transport  services  along  with  rural  road  infrastructure \ndevelopment. This includes improvement of bus and truck terminals, for which the Government \nplans to provide subsidies to provincial and local governments.6  \n \n5.  ADB has financed two specific studies to improve road transport in the PRC.7 The first \nstudy, conducted in 1994, (i) assessed the structure, operations, and financial performance of \nstate-owned and private passenger and freight transport; (ii) identified the characteristics that \nconstrain  the  efficiency  of  the  road  transport  industry;  and  (iii)  recommended  options  for \neffective  market-oriented  operations.  The  recommendations  were  selectively  taken  up  in \nsubsequent  road  subsector  projects.  The  second  study,  completed  in  2005,  focused  on \nformulating  and  implementing  policy  reforms  in  the  freight  and  passenger  road  transport \nindustries. This study identified critical issues in the subsector\u2019s (i) structure and performance, \n(ii) policies and plans for development, and (iii) governing institutions and regulatory framework. \nBased on the impact of policy, regulatory measures in three provinces, and lessons from other \ncountries,  the  study  proposed  an  action  plan  for  policy  reforms.  Some  of  the  study\u2019s \nrecommendations are included in a project preparatory technical assistance and proposed road \nsector loan.8 These studies also provide some useful insight to the issue of road transport in \nrural areas.  \n \n6.  Road transport services are regulated by provincial communication departments (PCDs) \nunder MOC\u2019s policy and guidelines. The PCDs issue licenses to transport operators, trucks, \nbuses, drivers, and intercity bus services through their transport administration bureaus (TABs). \nCounty and township communication bureaus (CBs) are responsible for lower-level networks. \nPassenger buses are classified in three categories according to size (or seating capacity) and \nlevel  of  service  provided.  To  be  eligible  for  a  license,  bus  operators  must  meet  basic \nrequirements for vehicle ownership, driver\u2019s qualifications, and management capability. Routes \nare categorized in four classes based on the population centers they serve. Provincial TABs \nprovide licenses for interprovincial bus routes, while lower-level routes are licensed by county \nCBs. Passenger fares are regulated by MOC, which issues annual national fare guidelines. \nFares are established by PCDs and CBs based on these guidelines. For freight transport, the \ntrucks are categorized in four classes based on their carrying capacity. Operators must meet \nbasic  financial  resource  and  maintenance  capacity  requirements  to  obtain  a  license.  The \nvehicles  are  inspected  annually.  There  is  no  restriction  on  freight  transport  tariffs.  Both \npassenger and  freight  transport  services  are  provided  by  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs), \nforeign joint ventures, privately owned companies, and small operators. While the private sector \nis more closely involved in freight transport, passenger transport, particularly in rural areas, is \ndominated by provincial or municipal SOEs.  \n   \n7.  Transport services in rural areas are inadequate. Due to low demand, short journeys, \nand the limited ability of rural passengers to pay for transport, the services are unprofitable and \ndo not attract investment. The existing regulatory framework does not encourage or provide \n                                                 \n6   For each terminal, the Government will provide a subsidy of CNY200,000 in the western region, CNY150,000 in the \ncentral region, and CNY100,000 in the eastern region. \n7  ADB. 1993.

Manila. \n ", "    3 \nincentives to operators to improve services in rural areas. Consequently, services are infrequent \nand of poor quality. Some rural transport services are provided by CBs and SOEs who cover the \nlosses through subsidies from profitable routes. There are also some government subsidies for \nrural services, but these are limited to infrastructure such as bus stops. Several county CBs \ncharge lower fees and taxes to bus operators in areas where services are not profitable. These \nconcessions are in the form of reduced transport management fees and passenger charges. \n \n8.  Bus service quality varies, with villages or townships near main highways benefiting from \nbetter  service,  while  remotely  located  population  centers  lack  quality  bus  service.  Remote \nvillages  are  served  by  informal  transport  operators,  typically  through  motor  tricycles,  dual-\npurpose trucks (carrying freight as well as passengers), and baby taxis (microbuses with seven \nseats). These vehicles are the only available means of transport in most townships and villages \nwith very poor road conditions, as the authorities will not issue licenses to bus operators for \nsafety reasons.     \n \n9.  The current regulatory restrictions on bus route capacity and bus/terminal fares is an \nimpediment to (i) maximizing vehicle utilization, (ii) increasing bus operating efficiency, and \n(iii) reducing  cost  through  more  flexible  market  competition.  The  role  of  road  transport \nadministrations, which need to focus on monitoring the operations of the market and enforcing \npublic safety and environmental regulations, should also be reviewed. \n \n10.  Provincial and municipal road transport administrations also control the development \nand operation of bus and truck terminals. Passenger and freight transport terminals or stations \nare  classified  in  four  categories  based  on  capacity,  land  area,  facilities,  and  equipment. \nDevelopment of class I\u2013II transport terminals is usually planned by provincial TABs, while others \nare generally planned by prefecture and county CBs, with approval of the provincial TAB. The \nterminals  are  normally  operated  as  public  facilities  by  SOEs  that  serve  bus  and  truck \ncompanies.  To  ensure  fair  competition,  terminal  operators  are  distinct  from  bus  and  truck \noperators.  Terminal  operators  are  responsible  for  regulating  bus  departure  schedules  and \nensuring vehicle safety; bus terminal fares are regulated by the provincial authorities. \n \n11.  The  terminals\u2019  lack  of  needed  infrastructure,  limited  capacity  and  low-level  facilities \nimpede the growth of improved bus and truck services. Many freight transport stations/centers \nare simply parking places, and many townships and villages lack bus stations/stops. Both high-\nlevel transport centers and base-level town bus stations and village bus stops are needed in \norder to closely connect urban and rural areas through an integrated transport service network, \nin  keeping  with  the  road  network  improvements.  In  rural  townships  and  villages,  bus \nstations/stops that provides a comfortable and safe passenger environment are lacking. Instead, \nrandom roadside areas or temporary areas in the township center are used as makeshift bus \nstops. This is both inefficient and unsafe, causing traffic blockages and road safety issues. The \nproblem is exacerbated if the road passes through a crowded street market in the center of a \ntownship. \n \n12.  The provincial TAB sets general layout standards for and subsidizes half the cost of the \nconstruction  of  township  stations  and  village  stops,  with  local  CBs  responsible  for  their \ndevelopment. The standards are useful to ensure required facilities are provided and budgets \ncontrolled, but the standards are too restrictive, as route requirements vary significantly. Some \nexisting township bus stations are not fully utilized, because of high terminal fees and low \npassenger flows that make transport services unviable. Although land-use planning and design \nstandards are important, the dominant role played by local governments means that terminals \nare  not  developed  from  the  point  of  view  of  road  transport  users  and  suppliers.  Modern \n ", "4 \nfreight/logistics terminals equipped with information technology are lacking in most provinces, \nresulting in cargo damage, longer lead times for trucks, additional shifting of cargo, and reduced \nefficiency. \n \n13.  Development  of  rural  areas  requires  a  seamless  and  integrated  transport  services \nnetwork, which connects urban and rural areas through high-level transport terminals in major \ncities and base-level bus stations/stops in townships and villages.    \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n14.  The TA will contribute to the Government\u2019s objective of balanced and sustainable rural \neconomic growth. The TA will help the Government provide reliable, efficient and safe transport \nto  the  rural  population  under  the  11th  FYP,  by  assisting  in  the  reform  of  policies  and \ndevelopment of plans for improvement of rural transport services to supplement the rural roads \ndevelopment program. This will be achieved by (i) undertaking a detailed assessment of rural \ntransport, in particular transport operators, terminals, vehicles and routes; (ii) identifying priority \nrural transport projects to be implemented under the 11th FYP, in line with the Government\u2019s \nobjectives; (iii) recommending policy reforms for improvement of rural transport services; and \n(iv) developing the Government\u2019s capacity to plan and implement rural transport improvements. \nThe TA will assist the Government in planning and providing financing for improvement of \ntransport services in rural areas.        \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  International consultants, supported by domestic consultants, will be engaged to help the \nGovernment improve rural transport services. The proposed TA will be undertaken in close \nconsultation with the national and local governments and will take into consideration previous \nstudies carried out by the Government, ADB, and other multilateral agencies. The TA will \ninvolve  analytical  research,  field  work,  training,  and  consultations  with  the  Government, \nprovincial governments, and local stakeholders. The TA will be based on case studies in three \nprovinces, selected from eastern, western, and central regions.9         \n \n16.  Key activities under the proposed TA include (i) a detailed assessment of transport \nservices in rural areas; (ii) recommendations on reforming the policy and regulatory framework \nto improve licensing and tariff setting; (iii) development of (a) incentives for transport operators \nto extend services to rural areas; (b) prioritized plans for development of transport terminals, \nstations,  and  stops  in  rural  areas  under  the  11th  FYP;  and  (c)  sustainable  measures  for \noperation  of  transport  terminals  in  rural  areas;  (iv)  capacity  development  of  institutions \nresponsible for rural transport; (v) drafting of measures relating to transport service safety; and \n(vi) assessment of financing needs to improve and expand rural transport services.      \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000. The Government requested ADB to \nfinance $400,000 equivalent, to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and $186,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The TA is proposed to be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA \nfunding program. The Government will finance the remaining $100,000 equivalent, which will be \n                                                 \n9   MOC will advise ADB of the selected provinces before the start of the TA. \n ", "    5 \nused to cover office accommodation and other facilities and services required to implement the \nTA. The details of the cost estimate and financing plan are in Appendix 1.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n18.  The TA will require about 23 person-months of consulting services (7 international and \n16 domestic) spread over a period of 6 months, including field work. The consultants will be \nengaged by ADB in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. A \nteam  of  international  consultants,  in  association  with  domestic  consulting  firm(s),  will  be \nengaged following the quality- and cost-based selection method, using biodata proposals. Two \ninternational consultants will provide expertise in rural transport (i) planning and operations; and \n(ii) policy, regulatory frameworks, and financing. One of the international consultants will be the \nteam leader. In addition, six domestic consultants will provide expertise with respect to the \nfollowing aspects of rural transport services: (i) planning and operations; (ii) policy, regulatory \nframeworks, and financing; (iii) transport terminals; (iv) vehicle operations and maintenance; (v) \nsocial development; and (vi) management and capacity development. Appendix 2 presents the \noutline terms of reference for consulting services.            \n \n19.  MOC will be the Executing Agency and will be responsible for guiding and supervising \nTA activities, and for coordination with relevant Government agencies, and provincial and local \ngovernments. The TA is expected to begin in October 2006 and is scheduled to be completed \nby April 2007. The consultants will identify, provide logistical support for, and monitor the \noverseas training programs. MOC will provide the consultants with all relevant materials, recent \nstudies, and reports required for the TA. The consultants will maintain close contact with MOC \nand ADB and will keep them informed of the TA progress and findings. Tripartite meetings \ninvolving the Government, ADB staff, and the consultants will be held in the PRC to review \nreports  and  provide  guidance.  The  consultants  will  procure  equipment  under  the  TA  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006). \n \n20.  The consultants will submit the following reports to ADB and MOC: (i) inception report, 4 \nweeks following commencement of services; (ii) interim report, 10 weeks after commencement; \n(iii) draft final report, within 21 weeks of commencement; and (iv) final report, 2 weeks after \nreceiving all comments from MOC and ADB. The consultants will hold stakeholder consultation \nworkshops in the three selected provinces within 10 weeks of commencement of the services, \nand a final national workshop in Beijing to disseminate the TA findings within 4 weeks of \nsubmission of the draft final report. Each report will be submitted in English and Chinese to the \nMinistry of Finance, National Development Reform Commission, and MOC. Only the English \nversion of the report will be submitted to ADB. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.
