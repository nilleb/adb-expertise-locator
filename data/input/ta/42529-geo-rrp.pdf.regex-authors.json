The Program is a follow-up to \nADB's Emergency Assistance for Post-Conflict Recovery (EAPCR) \nloan to Georgia, approved in November 2008. \n \nClassification    Targeting classification: General intervention \nSectors  (subsectors):  Multisector  (economic  and  public  affairs \nmanagement,  public  expenditure  and  fiscal  management,  social \nprotection) \nThemes  (subthemes):  Economic  growth  (promoting \nmacroeconomic  stability),  governance  (economic  and  financial \ngovernance), social development \nLocation impact: National (high impact) \n \nEnvironment     Category C. No adverse environmental impacts identified. \nAssessment     \n \nSocial Sector    Involuntary resettlement: category C \nAssessment    Impact on indigenous peoples: category C \n \nThe Program Description   The loss of investor confidence, caused initially by the August 2008 \nand Rationale  conflict and then by the international financial crisis have caused a \n  sharp slowdown in capital inflows (both foreign direct investment \n  and private lending) to Georgia. The inflows may not recover to the \n  pre-crises levels until 2010. These exogenous shocks are being \n  amplified  by  a  slowdown  in  Georgia's  export  markets  and  a \n  reduction  in  incoming  remittances.  All  major  components  of \n  aggregate  demand  in  the  economy  have  contracted  and  the \n  macroeconomic outlook for Georgia has been revised downwards, \n  and remains very uncertain at this stage. Before the August conflict, \n  real gross domestic product (GDP) was forecast to grow at 11\u201312% \n  in 2008. The actual GDP growth was 2%, with the forecast for 2009 \n  at 1%. Economic activity has slowed considerably, profit margins \n  have  sharply  decreased,  and  layoffs  have  risen.  The  social \n  consequences of these developments could be very severe.  \n \nThe Government and the monetary and financial sector authorities \nin Georgia have worked closely to address these challenges. When \nthe Georgian lari came under pressure in August 2008, and again in \nOctober  and  November,  the  National  Bank  of  Georgia  (NBG) \nintervened to support the currency. To shore up reserves depleted \nin defense of the lari and to bolster lari depositor confidence, the \nGovernment and the NBG entered into a $750 million Stand-By \nArrangement (SBA) with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). By \nhelping  to  rebuild  the  official  foreign  exchange  reserves  and  to ", "ii   \nrestore  confidence  in  the  lari,  the  SBA  framework  supports  the \nGovernment's  macroeconomic  policy  objectives  of  accelerating \nrecovery through fiscal stimulus, allowing exchange rate flexibility, \nand safeguarding banking system stability.  \n \nA significant macroeconomic stimulus is required to counter these \nadverse shocks. However, the very high and increasing use of the \nUS dollar in the economy constrains what fiscal or monetary policy \ncan do. Such constraints can only be relaxed by: (i) recourse to \nexternal and long-term loans from development partners to finance \ncore public expenditures and augment foreign exchange reserves, \nand (ii) maintenance of some exchange rate stability, to avoid sharp \nfluctuations in the value of the lari. In parallel, the banking system \nneeds to remain stable for these measures to be effective. \n \nThe joint needs assessment (JNA) by several development partners \nin September 2008 remains the most appropriate framework for \ndealing with the crisis, both in terms of assessing the need for, and \ndesigning,  budget  support  and  infrastructure  and  social  sector \nassistance.  The  JNA  identifies  a  need  for  intervention  and \ndevelopment partner assistance in three major areas: (i) to help the \nGovernment ensure that critical economic and social needs are met \nand confidence is maintained, with quick-disbursing budget support \nto back-stop countercyclical fiscal measures of rapid effect; (ii) to \nresettle  internally displaced persons and address the post-conflict \nneeds  of  affected  populations;  and  (iii)  to  support  critical  new \ninvestments.  The  JNA  notes  that  high-value  and  high-yield \ninvestments  are  key  to  maximizing  recovery  prospects  and  that \nsuch  investments  will  also  have  lasting  positive  effects  on  the \neconomy's productive capacity. \n \nThe JNA estimated the overall resource requirements at $3.7 billion \nover a 3-year period. Actions were prioritized in three stages: stage \n1 (6 months, September 2008\u2013March 2009); stage 2 (12 months, \nApril 2009\u2013March 2010); and stage 3 (12\u201318 months, March 2010\u2013\nSeptember 2011). The relevance of the JNA has been reinforced by \nthe  severity  of  the  impact  of  the  crisis  on  Georgia  and  the \ncontinuing uncertainty of capital flows. \n \nThe  proposed  Program  is  a  follow-up  to  the  EAPCR.  The \nmacroeconomic policy framework anchor is provided for in the SBA \nbetween  Georgia  and  the  IMF.  Like  the  earlier    program,  it  is \nanchored  on  the  JNA.  It  will  continue  ADB  support  for  the \nGovernment to help it meet critical public expenditures and cushion \nthe adverse revenue shocks that will probably persist throughout \n2009.  The  Program  will  complement  two  planned  ADB \ninfrastructure  projects  (the  Municipal  and  Urban  Infrastructure \nDevelopment Project and the Ajara Bypass Roads Project). The \nWorld Bank plans to provide $85 million in budget support through \nits  Development  Policy  Operation.  The  European  Union  is  also ", "  iii\nexpected to provide budgetary assistance in the near future.  The \nProgram will support the following outputs.  \n     \nOutput 1. Incremental expenditure needs arising from the worse-\nthan-expected  economic  conditions  in  2009  are  met  without \ncomplete drawn down of cash balances at NBG.  \n \nOutput  2.  The  delivery  of  the  core  Government  expenditure \nprogram  for  2009  in  accordance  with  the  approved  budget, \nirrespective of subsequent revisions that take into account shortfalls \nin revenue. \n \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Program will be partial mitigation of the adverse \neconomic and social impact of the global economic crisis. ADB's \nsupport, as part of the overall crisis mitigation efforts, will help to \nrevive real GDP growth rates to an annual average of at least 4% a \nyear over 2009\u20132011. \n \nSpecial Features  Full  Alignment  with  the  Government's  Crisis  Mitigation \nProgram. ADB's support will be part of the Government's crisis \nmitigation plan, which is embodied in the JNA. It will help sustain \nkey  expenditure  items  that  have  been  prioritized  by  the \nGovernment.  The  social  safety  net  and  physical  infrastructure \ninvestment  plans  included  in  the  JNA,  to  be  funded  by  the \nGovernment and its development partners, are expected to allow \nGeorgia  to  respond  effectively  to  the  drastic  decline  in  capital \ninflows that began in 2008, and which the global financial crisis has \nnow confirmed.  \n \nBudget  Support with  the  IMF  Stand-By  Arrangement  as  the \nAnchor. Satisfactory progress with the IMF's SBA is a prerequisite \nfor  Program  approval.  The  SBA's  actions  and  performance \nbenchmarks  focus  on  monetary  and  exchange-rate  policy \nconsistency with external macroeconomic balance, and on ensuring \nfinancial sector confidence, thus opening space for a fiscal stimulus \npackage  to  be  funded  by  official  inflows  to  limit  the  economic \nslowdown. With the IMF Program and the JNA as the two principal \nanchors, the proposed Program will not have its own set of policy or \ninstitutional reform measures. \n \nParallel Focus on Critical Financial Sector Reforms. Georgia \nneeds  to  undertake  certain  critical  financial  sector  regulatory \nmeasures immediately. The following key measures and steps are \nbeing  taken  as an  outcome  of  the  policy  dialogue  between  the \nGovernment  and  ADB.  They  have  been  agreed  upon  and \nrecognized  in  the  Loan  Agreement.  Working  with  development \npartners, the Government will:  \n \n(i)  introduce a regulatory framework to mitigate  \n    systemic banking risks,  \n(ii)  complete  implementation  of  the  real-time  gross\n  settlement system,  \n ", "iv   \n(iii)    develop  the  operational  framework  for  foreign\n  exchange auctions,  \n(iv)    design a foreign exchange dealing system, and \n(v)    further develop action plan for maintaining financial \n  and  macroeconomic  stability  with  clear  division  of\n  responsibilities  among  the  relevant  ministries  and \n  agencies (also an action under the IMF SBA).  \n  \nUse of Covenants to Monitor Execution of Key Expenditure \nItems. The Government has identified key expenditure items for \n2009, which the Program aims to insulate from further  revenue \nshocks.  For  monitoring  and  evaluation  purposes,  these  key \nexpenditure  items  shall  be  included  as  covenants  in  the  Loan \nAgreement. \n \nTranching  The loans will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n \nFinancing Plan  The Government has requested a loan of $80 million from ADB\u2019s \nAsian Development Fund resources. ADB will provide two loans with \nsynchronized  repayment  schedules:  (i)  a  loan  of  $50  million \nequivalent for a term of 24 years, including an 8-year grace period \nand with an interest rate at 1% per annum during the grace period \nand  1.5%  per  annum  thereafter;  and  (ii)  a  loan  of  $30  million \nequivalent from the ADF hard-term facility for a term of 24 years, \nincluding an 8-year grace period and with an interest rate of 1.6% per \nannum  during  the  grace  period  and  for  each  interest  period \nthereafter. \n \nPeriod of Utilization  The expected closing date of the loan is 31 December 2009. The \nloan is planned to be fully utilized by the Government within 2009. \n \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency.  \n \nProcurement and  Loan  proceeds  will  be  used  to  pay  for  items  procured  in  ADB \nDisbursement  member countries, other than the items specified in the negative list \n  of  ineligible  items  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and \n  multilateral  sources.  The  proceeds  of  the  program  loan  will  be \n  disbursed in accordance with the provisions of ADB\u2019s simplification \n  of disbursement procedures and related requirements for program \n  loans.  Loan  proceeds  disbursed  against  imports  will  require  a \n  certificate from the Government stipulating that the value of the total \n  imports of Georgia, minus its imports from nonmember countries, \n  ineligible  imports,  and  imports  financed  under  other  official \n  development assistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of \n  the loan expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB \n  reserves the right to audit the use of loan proceeds to verify the \n  accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.   \n ", "  v\nCounterpart Funds  The Government shall ensure that the local currency generated \nfrom the proceeds of the ADF loan shall be used to support public \nexpenditure objectives under the program. \n \nProject Benefits  The slowdown in economic activity needs to be countered by an \nexpansionary fiscal policy package that stops the downward spiral \nof  loss  of  confidence  and  contraction  in  demand,  mitigates  the \nadverse social impacts of the crisis, and provides a platform for \nfuture  growth  by  creating  high-value,  high-impact  public \ninfrastructure.  \n \nIn  the  absence  of  domestic  debt  markets,  only  external \ndevelopment  partner  support  in  the  form  of  hard  currency  can \nenable the Government to respond to the current circumstances \nwith  a  well-designed  fiscal  stimulus  package.  That  external \nassistance has been sought in the context of the JNA, a multi-year \nand multi-development- partner effort. The Program, together with \nparallel budget support from the World Bank and European Union, \nwill help the Government to implement the fiscal measures already \nincluded in the 2009 budget aimed at preventing a deterioration of \nsocial situation as a result of the economic crisis.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  Although there was confidence that the process initiated by the JNA \nand finalized at the Brussels Conference would mean Georgia was \nwell  positioned  to  weather  the  shocks  described  above,  recent \nmonths  have  revealed  additional  signs  of  vulnerability  in  the \nfinancial sector and in the resources available to the Government to \nmitigate the negative effects of the shocks. Georgia's development \npartners  recognize  the  need  to  maintain  resource  flows  to  the \ncountry.  \n \nThe Government launched the JNA within days of the outbreak of \nthe August 2008 conflict to ensure that there was a clear strategy \nand sufficient resources to keep the focus on reforms and secure \nsufficient   resources to keep Georgia on track. At the same time, \nthe  Government  worked  with  several  development  partners  to \nestablish a 3-year timeframe for the JNA. This demonstrates the \nGovernment's capacity to act quickly in the face of adversity and \nchallenges. A recent review of the JNA led by the World Bank and \nthe  United  Nations  found:  \"the  Government  has  managed  the \nrecovery and reconstruction effort with skill and determination and \nthe results on the ground have been highly encouraging.\"  \n \nThe signs of vulnerability in the financial sector highlight the need \nfor the regulatory authorities to have an effective prompt corrective \naction  framework.  The  financial  supervision  and  monetary \nauthorities' willingness to  improve  risk  mitigation  in  the  financial \nsector is reassuring Georgia's development partners. \n \nOther  external  risks  include  the  potential  rekindling  of  regional \ntensions. However, this is mitigated by the multilateral presence in the \nfield. There have also been political tensions within Georgia, although \n ", "vi   \nthe protests have been peaceful. The nature of the crisis is such that \nthere is likely to be a consensus across the political spectrum with \nrespect to the urgent need for crisis mitigation.  \n \n  \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed program \nloans to Georgia for the Growth Recovery Support Program.1  \n \nII.  THE 2008 CONFLICT AND THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL CRISIS \n2.  Pre-Crisis  Performance.  Georgia  has  implemented  noteworthy  investment  climate  and \npublic  financial  management  reforms  before  the  armed  conflict  with  Russia  in  August  2008 \naggravated the impact of the global financial crisis. The reforms, coupled with a wide ranging \nprivatization program, helped attract significant foreign direct investment (FDI) into the country. \nAnnual economic growth rates averaged 10.5% over 2005\u20132007, supported by a surge in FDI \ninflows and the resulting increase in demand, and reached 12.4% in 2007. In August 2007, an \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) document on Georgia noted that \"economic performance in \nrecent years has been impressive, with the establishment of macroeconomic stability, a dramatic \nfiscal turnaround, and remarkable improvements in governance and the business environment\u2026\"2 \nBefore the conflict and the exogenous economic shocks, economic growth was forecast to be above \n9% for both 2008 and 2009.3  \n \nFigure 1: External Shocks to Economic Activity \n20 18 Georgia\u2019s 5-Year Eurobond Spread \n18 16 s\nnt 2,500\n16 14 oi\np\n14 12 asis \n12 10 es, b 2,000\n10 uri\n8  8 eas 1,500\n6  6 US Tr\n4  4 ver  1,000\no\n2  2 ad \ne\n0  0 spr 500\nd \n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 el\nYi\nEEFFDDccooII  nn((%%oomm  GGiiccDD  ggPPrr)oo)  wwsscctthhee  nnssaaccrreeiioonn  aapprroriieoos-  tpcp-coroeons-nftc-lficolcioctn tnf( lR(ficlRiHctH t(S LS( LHa HaxSxiSs ias )ax)xisis))   0   Apr-08   May-08  Jun-08  Jul-08  Aug-08     Sep-08    Oct-08          Nov-08 Dec-08   Jan-09  Feb-09 Mar-09  \nGDP = gross domestic product, FDI = foreign direct   \ninvestment, LHS = left hand side, RHS = right hand side. \n \nSources: United Nations and World Bank. 2008.

FDI inflows, international private lending to commercial \nbanks, and related privatization revenues have decelerated sharply; a trend that is expected to \npersist over the next 12\u201318 months at least. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed to \n                                                 \n1  Appendix 1 presents the design and monitoring framework for the Program. \n2  IMF.

", "2   \n2% in 2008 and will be around 1% in 2009.4 Symptomatic of the declining investor confidence, \nGeorgia\u2019s 5-year Eurobond spread increased from 530 basis points above US Treasury Bonds on \n31 July 2008 to 700 basis points at the peak of the conflict (Figure 1). Subsequently, this spread \nwidened to almost 2000 basis points by late November, in great part as a result of heightened global \nrisk aversion. As a result of the sudden halt in FDI and debt inflows, consumer and investor \nspending plunged, leading to sharp reductions in producer price growth and corporate profits, as \nwell as in overall economic activity. Table 1 captures these deteriorating trends. \n \n4.  Sharp Reduction in Business Activity and Job Creation. The negative shock to FDI and \ndebt inflows has been aggravated by a recent decline in remittances and a slowdown in Georgia's \nexport markets. As a result, all major components of aggregate demand have contracted. Demand \nand price growth have been hit particularly hard for non-tradables, such as construction, tourism and \ntransport, which have constituted the bulk of the Georgian economy in recent years. This in turn has \nslashed  profit  margins  and  increased  unemployment  throughout  the  economy.  The  outlook  for \nGeorgia has been revised downwards several times, and remains at this stage very uncertain. The \nsocial consequences of an eventual scenario of negative growth could be significant. \n \n5.  Potential Financial Sector Stress. The banking system has had to deal with both a sharp \ncontraction in dollar liquidity as international funding availability has dried up, and with a general and \nrapid deterioration in borrowers' creditworthiness. With urban unemployment increasing and profit \nmargins rapidly shrinking, the ability of many borrowers to repay loans has been seriously affected. \nAbout half the bank loans are collateralized by real estate, whose prices are now starting to come \ndown (anecdotal estimates point to a 15% reduction since November 2008). The ratio of banks' non-\nperforming loans has increased rapidly in the past few months, while general refinancing options for \nthe banking sector have shrunk. The usual symptoms of liquidity problems can already be observed, \nwith some banks increasing interest rates on their time deposits in order to retain cash balances. \nSome banks have had need of foreign exchange liquidity, which presented a challenge to monetary \nand  exchange  rate  policy.

RESPONSE BY THE GOVERNMENT AND ITS DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS   \nTO THE EXTERNAL SHOCKS \nA.  Immediate Response to Effects of August 2008 Crisis \n6.  Launching the Joint Needs Assessment. In the immediate aftermath of the August \n2008 conflict, the damage to physical infrastructure and the urgent need to address the needs of \n120,000 additional internally displaced persons imposed significant strains on public finances. \nThe negative shock to fiscal revenues risked jeopardizing critical programs and fiscal stability. \nPublic spending because of conflict-related costs5 was, to some extent, offset by trimming \nnonessential  expenditures  and  drawing  down  the  Treasury's  cash  balances  at  the  NBG. \nHowever, fiscal pressure was evident and an amendment to the 2008 budget, submitted in \nSeptember 2008 to Parliament, projected lower revenues than envisaged, lower privatization \nreceipts, and higher expenditures as a result of the conflict. It also predicted a decrease in \nnonessential  expenditures,  although  this  decrease  was  insufficient  to  offset  the  decline  in \nrevenues and increases in other expenditures. It was in this context that the Joint Needs \nAssessment (JNA) was launched by the Government and its development partners immediately \nafter  the  conflict  (Appendix  7).  The  JNA  estimated  that  $3.7  billion  would  be  needed  for \nGeorgia\u2019s post-conflict recovery. A key driving factor in the JNA was how to support Georgia \neffectively so that the successful reform momentum before the August conflict would not be \nderailed. The JNA also estimated the financial assistance required to reestablish conditions for \na return to sustained growth under several scenarios, including a worst case in which the \ninterruption in capital inflows would continue till 2011. Of the estimated JNA requirements, $896 \n                                                 \n5  These costs arose mainly from the high number of internally-displaced citizens immediately after the conflict, who \nneeded shelter, food and a social services program. ", "  5\nmillion  will  be  needed  immediately  for  recovery  efforts  (for  the  period  until  March  2009), \nincluding $480 million to meet immediate budgetary needs.  \n \n7.  Response from Development Partners. Several development partners, including the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), responded promptly in the aftermath of the August 2008 \nconflict. Table 2 lists these initiatives, most of which were based on the September 2008 JNA.  \n \nTable 2: Post-Conflict Development Partner Assistance for Georgia in 2008 \n($ million) \nDevelopment Partner Details  Amount \nInternational Monetary Fund  750.0 \n18-month Stand-By Arrangement \nFinancing support to rebuild gross international reserves and to help restore investor confidence \nUnited States   \nBudget support   250.0 \nEmergency relief and rehabilitation support  750.0 \nWorld Bank   \nSupplemental Financing of Fourth Poverty Reduction Support Operation      40.0 \nMunicipal Development Fund     40.0 \nEuropean Union      50.0 \nBudget Support      15.0 \nGovernment of the Netherlands      3.0 \nInternational Finance Corporation   \nTrade finance and liquidity facility for banks  200.0 \nAsian Development Bank   \nEmergency Assistance Post-Conflict Recovery     70.0 \nMunicipal Development Fund (approved in September 2008)    40.0 \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Georgia. \n8.  IMF Program. The rising pressures on the lari required pragmatic and swift actions from \nthe authorities. In October\u2013November 2008, the authorities let the lari slide by about 17% \nagainst  the  US  dollar  and  then  intervened  at  the  end  of  November  forcefully  to  stop  the \ndownward spiral at a new support level, which it has been able to maintain. To shore up \nreserves depleted in defense of the lari and to bolster lari depositor confidence, the Government \nand  the  NBG  entered  into  a  $750  million  Stand-By  Arrangement  (SBA)  with  the  IMF  in \nSeptember  2008.  To  accommodate  the  liquidity  squeeze  faced  by  banks,  the  NBG,  in \ncoordination with the Financial Supervisory Agency, adjusted its regulatory framework by: (i) \nlowering reserve requirements, (ii) reducing the liquidity ratio requirement, (iii) introducing a \nspecial bridge financing facility, and (iv) putting in place a refinancing window to provide a new \nbenchmark policy rate. \n \n9.  ADB Immediate Response. ADB has responded swiftly in the aftermath of the conflict. \nIn addition to participating in the JNA exercise, measures taken by ADB in 2008 included: \nfinalization and approval of $40 million in investment support through the Municipal Services \nDevelopment Fund Project;6 close coordination with the principal development partners of \nGeorgia, particularly the World Bank, the IMF, the European Union (EU), and the United States; \nand mobilizing an additional $70 million equivalent in ADF resources.7 to meet critical public \nexpenditures through the budget and help to cushion adverse revenue shocks. As its major \noutputs, the EAPCR aimed to ensure that: (i) immediate incremental expenditure needs arising \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2008.

Current Response to Effects of the International Financial Crisis \n10.  International Financial Crisis. By the end of October and early November 2008, the \neffects  of  the  international  liquidity  crisis  started  to  unfold  in  Georgia.  These  impacts  are \nexpected to continue adversely affecting the Georgian economy for the next 12\u201318 months. The \nreversal  of  the  international  carry  trade  in  currencies  since  October  2008  (as  a  direct \nconsequence of the global liquidity crisis and heightened global perception of risk) started to \nexert  strong  funding  pressures  on  the  Georgian  banking  sector  through  exchange  rate \npressures. There have been large lari deposit withdrawals and a sudden increase in the use of \nthe US dollar in the economy.8 Refinancing options of international syndications have now \nbecome much less available.9 Together with the declining demand for lari, this has added \nforeign exchange liquidity concerns to the deteriorating loan portfolio quality conditions in banks. \nThe resilience of the banking system has declined.  \n \n11.  In response, the NBG and the Financial Supervisory Agency have relaxed liquidity and \nreserve requirements and provided some short-term liquidity support to financial institutions. \nHowever, this has its limits and it is now crucial to (i) stimulate the real economy with an overall \nframework of public works that can establish a floor to the decline in economic activity and lari \ndemand, and (ii) improve the authorities' capacity to monitor the financial system.  \n \n12.  Current economic circumstances confirm the difficult scenarios already built into the \nJNA,  and  the  expectation  that  fiscal  difficulties  would  continue  thorough  2009\u20132011  with \nshortfalls  in  revenue  collection  (when  compared  with  the  pre-conflict  and  pre-international \nfinancial crisis period). The macroeconomic situation calls for the Government to adopt a very \nclear fiscal stance to reverse the downturn. However, the very high use of the US dollar in the \neconomy limits what both fiscal and monetary policy can do to address the situation. These \nconstraints  can  only  be  relaxed  by  (i)  hard-currency  long-term  loans  from  bilateral  and \nmultilateral  partners  to  finance  public  spending  and  provide  additional  foreign  exchange \nreserves to back the NBG's exchange rate policy, (ii) maintenance of a stable exchange rate (at \nleast to the extent that sharp fluctuations in the lari value are avoided), and (iii) stability in the \nbanking system. \n \n13.  Joint Needs Assessment. The JNA remains fully relevant as a framework to address \nthe impact of the global crisis on Georgia and can be used to coordinate the work of the \nGovernment and its development partners. The JNA identified the need for intervention and \ndevelopment partner assistance in several areas, including essential productivity-enhancing \ninfrastructure investment and targeted social support to bridge the period of private capital \ninflows drought. It was developed as a contingency plan and is fully appropriate to the current \ncircumstances. Of the external financial assistance needs estimated until March 2009 ($896 \nmillion) in the JNA, development partners had disbursed more than half ($564.2 million) by 1 \nApril,  2009,  and  mostly  in  the  form  of  budget  support  ($395.9  million).  Of  the  total  \n$878 million development partner assistance pledged and contracted in 2008, the remaining \nhalf, mostly infrastructure financing, will be disbursed gradually during 2009. For 2009, the \n                                                 \n8  Recent episodes of withdrawals on lari deposits may repeat themselves every time there is some exchange rate \npressure. Sharp downwards exchange rate movements will negatively affect the balance sheets of both banks and \ncompanies. \n9  Although foreign net private equity and lending inflows to banks was about $681 million in the first half of 2008, they \nwere negative in the second half of 2008, and are now expected to remain very low throughout 2009.

Georgian State Budget. The Government submitted the 2009 budget to Parliament in \nDecember 2008. The budget was based on an assumption of 2.0\u20132.5% economic growth for \n2009 (Table 4). Table 4 also presents budget execution in 2008 for comparison. Overall, the \nGovernment  has  tried  to  compress  recurrent  state  expenditures  (reflected  in  a  projected \ndecrease in goods and services expenditure and grants to local administration, with a small \nincrease in recurrent capital expenses and subsidies) and to increase public investment.   \n \n15.  A  key  feature  of  the  2009  budget  is  the  budgeted  draw-down  of  the  state's  cash \nbalances deposited at the NBG in the amount of GEL522.2 million. This presents risks to the \nnormal functioning of expenditure programs, which in the current circumstances should be \navoided.  This  is  the  reason  why  the  Government's  budget  for  2009  was  presented  and \napproved with a zero ex-post financing gap.  \n \n16.  Based on ADB's commitments in late 2008, $40 million had already been tentatively \nbudgeted by the Government as a new net lending item, corresponding to about GEL66.5 \nmillion. The same amount was also budgeted to take into account the World Bank's new \ndevelopment policy operation to be approved in June 2009. \n \n17.  The  execution  of  the  first  quarter  already  shows  signs  of  worse  macroeconomic \nconditions than expected last December: net of tax payments made by the Ministry of Defense \nfor taxes due in 2008, the tax revenue collection for the first 3 months of 2009 was 11.4% below \nthe collection in the same period in 2008. In view of the shortfall in budget revenues already \n ", "8   \nrecognized for the first quarter of 2009, and the delays in execution of some donor-funded \ninvestment projects, the Government has requested the concerned donor partners to increase \nthe amounts of budget support operations being processed, and to the extent possible shift \nalready committed project-related assistance onto general budget assistance. The scheduled \nsubmission of a revised 2009 State Budget to the Georgian Parliament is in July. The revised \nprojections being finalized by the Government will already incorporate the larger than originally \nbudgeted support from ADB and the World Bank. \nTable 4: Georgian State Budget, 2009 \n(GEL million) \n \n  2008   2009  \nItem  (execution)  (budget) \nTotal Revenues  5,517.6  5,510.2 \nTotal (Recurrent) Expenses  5,554.6  5,252.0 \nIncrease in Nonfinancial Assets (Public Investment)     893.4     996.7 \nDecrease in Nonfinancial Assets (Privatization Proceeds)     568.8       78.3 \nTotal State Budget Balance     (361.6)    (660.2) \n \n \nFunding Plan \nDomestic  Net  Borrowing  (Net  Change  in  Domestic  Debt,  i.e.,       (52.4)  (258.4) \nmostly amortization) \nAmortization of External Debt       (58.6)  (186.3) \nExternal Borrowing (Change in External Debt )  1,073.2  536.6 \n     \nfrom WB and ADBa  208.8  133.0 \nEurobonds  723.8      0.0 \n140.6  403.6 \nfrom other Borrowing Sources \n     \nEx-Ante Financing Gap, funded by liquidating Financial Assets  (600.6)  568.3 \n \nof which, NBG deposit withdrawals areb (416.3)  522.2 \n     \nTotal Funding  361.6  660.2 \n \nEx-Post Financing Gap      0.0      0.0 \nUnit: GEL million \n ( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, NBG =  National Bank of Georgia, WB = World Bank. \na GEL133 million were already budgeted for in 2009, corresponding to $40 million from the World Bank and $40   \nmillion  from ADB pledged in the Brussels Donor Conference. \nb A negative figure means an accumulation of cash balances, a positive figure means a run-down in cash balances. \nSource: Ministry of Finance, Georgia. \n18.  Debt Sustainability. The IMF undertook a debt sustainability assessment in September \n2008 and an update in March 2009. These showed that the level of Georgia's external debt is \nlow.  Although external financing for post-conflict reconstruction may increase the debt ratios \nover the next 2 years, the debt outlook is expected to recover and improve over the medium \nterm. Georgia's key medium-term risks involve large debt servicing in 2012\u20132013 associated \nwith the repayments to the IMF under its recent SBA and the 2008 Eurobond (Appendix 2). \n \nIV.  ADB\u2019S ASSISTANCE AND DEVELOPMENT PARTNER COORDINATION \n19.  Asian Development Bank Country Strategy and Program. ADB\u2019s interim operational \nstrategy for Georgia (2008\u20132009), approved in January 2008, focuses on (i) improving service ", "  9\ndelivery in municipal infrastructure within the evolving decentralization process, (ii) reducing road \ntransportation  constraints  on  economic  activity,  and  (iii) upgrading  and  developing  energy \ninfrastructure.10 These priorities were identified based on the following considerations:  \n \n(i)  aligning priorities with the Government\u2019s development agenda,  \n(ii)  focusing limited resources on a small number of areas, and  \n(iii)  ensuring complementarities with other development partners.  \n \n20.  However, the cumulative effect of the economic shocks of the second half of 2008 has \nreconfigured  the  Government's  short-  and  medium-term  policy  plans,  and  made  external \nassistance in the form of budget support critical. ADB's interim strategy also highlights the need \nfor ADB to be responsive to rapid changes in circumstances. \n \n21.  Other Recent and Ongoing Assistance. A number of other development partners have \nsupported  public  financial  management,  private  sector  development,  and  social  safety  net \nreforms in Georgia in recent years (Appendix 3). The program of the United States Agency for \nInternational Development includes support in the areas of budgeting, treasury management, \ngovernance,  anticorruption,  and  private  sector  development.  The  Swedish  International \nDevelopment Agency supports in public sector and in governance reforms. The United Nations \nDevelopment Program has initiatives in the areas of administrative and civil service reforms, \npoverty  monitoring,  and  financial  system  modernization.  The  Department  for  International \nDevelopment of the United Kingdom has provided support in developing the medium-term \nexpenditure  framework  and  health  sector  budget  management.  The  Government  of  the \nNetherlands supports Georgia in areas, among others, related to governance and oversight \ninstitutions.  The  program  of  the  European  Commission  (EC)  includes  support  in \nintergovernmental fiscal relations, auditing, and administrative reform. The EC, together with the \nWorld Bank, has just completed a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) for \nGeorgia.  The  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development  focuses  on  investment \npromotion.  German  development  cooperation  through  GTZ  focuses  on  private  sector \ndevelopment, while KfW focuses on development of SMEs and energy sector. The Millennium \nChallenge  Corporation  program  includes  rehabilitation  of  key  regional  infrastructure,  and \ndelivery of regional and municipal services. \nV.  THE PROPOSED LOAN \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n22.  The impact of the Program will be partial mitigation of the adverse economic and social \nimpact of the global economic crisis. Its outcome, in tandem with other development partners' \nbudget support, will be to help Georgia implement a fiscal stimulus in 2009 in response to the \ncrisis.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n23.  The Program will provide $80 million equivalent in quick-disbursing financial support, \nwhich the Government will combine with its own and other resources to cushion the impact on \nthe expenditure program from negative revenue shocks, by ensuring: \n \n                                                 \n10  ADB. 2008.

The social safety net \nand  physical  infrastructure  investment  plans  included  in  the  JNA,  to  be  jointly  funded  by \nGovernment and development partners, are expected to allow Georgia to respond effectively to \nthe drastic and lasting decline in capital inflows that begun in 2008, and which the global \nfinancial crisis has now confirmed.  \n26.  Within this framework, the budget support from ADB aims to ensure that, irrespective of \nany unexpected revenue shocks in 2009, or the likely cash management difficulties brought ", " 11\nabout by mismatches in the receipt of revenue and the time of expenditure a number of key \nexpenditure  programs  already  included  in  the  2009  state  budget  can  be  implemented  as \nenvisaged.  At  the  moment,  there  are  no  short-term  cash  management  options  for  the \nGovernment, as the T-bill market has been inactive.   \n27.  The review of the JNA undertaken in May 2009, led by the World Bank and the United \nNations, noted that, while budget support provided by development partners in 2008 accrued to \nthe general budget and was not earmarked for specific spending, the revised budget adopted in \nthe post-conflict period did raise spending for internally displaced persons, for social needs and \ncounter-cyclical employment generating activities, whilst defense outlays were reduced. The \nreview also took the position that it is of critical importance that all donors translate their pledges \nfor budget support in 2009 into disbursements in a timely fashion, and to the extent donors still \nhave the flexibility to adjust the balance of their aid in 2009 towards budget support with some \nreduction in investment financing, that would be helpful to the authorities. \n28.  Program Anchored on the IMF SBA. The IMF SBA of $750 million for 18 months \nprovides balance of payment support and will help to maintain confidence in the authorities' \nmacroeconomic  policy  capacity.  Satisfactory  progress  with  the  SBA  is  a  prerequisite  for \napproval of the Program. The SBA focuses on monetary and exchange rate policy consistency \nwith  macroeconomic  external  balance,  and  on  ensuring  financial  sector  confidence,  thus \nopening space for a fiscal stimulus package to be funded by official inflows to limit the economic \nslowdown. The proposed Program will provide quick-disbursing support to meet this need.  \n29.  Georgia urgently needs resources to enable the Government to pursue countercyclical \nfiscal  policies  and,  given  the  monetary  and  debt  market  constraints,  the  quick-disbursing \nsupport offered by the Program is the optimal fit with the fiscal stimulus plans embodied in the \nJNA and envisaged in the 2009 budget.  \n30.  In  normal  circumstances,  ADB  program  lending  is  linked  as  closely  as  possible  to \ninstitutional reforms. However, in the case of Georgia, as in many other countries, the shocks \nare  exogenous  (although  they  have  revealed  certain  vulnerabilities).  Under  these \ncircumstances, the Program has adopted the policy actions and benchmarks contained in the \nSBA, which deal directly with the crisis. Moreover, It is desirable that the transaction costs of \nany support provided by development partners be kept as small as possible.  \n31.  Policy Dialogue on Critical Financial Sector Reforms. Georgia needs to undertake \ncertain critical financial sector regulatory measures immediately, which are recognized as part of \nADB  support  and  reflected  under  policy  dialogue  in  the  loan  agreement.  Working  with \ndevelopment partners, the Government will:  \n(i)  introduce regulatory framework to mitigate systemic banking risks,  \n(ii)  complete implementation of the real-time gross settlement system,  \n(iii)  develop the operational framework for foreign exchange auctions,  \n(iii)  design a foreign exchange dealing system, and \n(iv)  further develop action plan for maintaining financial and macroeconomic stability \n  with clear division of responsibilities among the relevant ministries and agencies \n  (which is a prior action in the IMF SBA). \n32.  Monitoring of Key Expenditure Items. The Government has identified key expenditure \nitems for 2009, which the Program aims to insulate from further revenue shocks. For monitoring \nand evaluation purposes, these key expenditure items have been agreed by the Government \nand ADB and are included in the Loan Agreement (Table 6).  \n ", "12  \nTable 6: Key State Budget Expenditure Objectives for 2009 \n \n  2008 Actual  2009 Budget  US Dollars \nItem  GEL ('000)  GEL ('000)  ('000) \n2009 Priority Projects Identified by the Government of Georgiaa      \n1.

Financing Plan \n33.  Proposed ADB Support. Given the continuing decline in state revenues and the critical \nneed to maintain core public expenditures, the Government has requested a loan of $80 million \nequivalent from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources to implement the Program. The Government's \noriginal financing requirements under the 2009 budget (approved in December 2008) are in \nTable 4.  As noted above, the World Bank is processing an $85 million development policy \noperation.

ADB's support will be structured through two loans, with a synchronized repayment \nschedule: (i) a loan of $50 million equivalent for a term of 24 years including an 8-year grace \nperiod and with an interest rate at 1% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter, and (ii)  a loan of $30 million equivalent from the ADF hard-term facility for a term of \n24 years including an 8-year grace period and with an interest rate of 1.6% per annum during the \ngrace period and for each interest period thereafter. \n \nE.  Program Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Program Management \n \n35.  The Ministry of Finance will be the Executing Agency for the Program.  \n \n36.  ADB  has  been  closely  engaged  with  other  development  partners,  the  Ministry  of \nFinance, the National Bank of Georgia and the Financial Supervisory Agency, in monitoring the \nmacroeconomic and public finance conditions and the financial sector.  \n \n2.  Implementation Period \n37.  The countercyclical fiscal measures and other regular core public expenditure programs \nsupported by the Program are to be implemented during 2009. While the single-tranche loans \nwill  be  disbursed  upon  effectiveness.  ADB  and  the  Government  will  closely  monitor  the \nexecution of all key core public expenditure programs until the end of 2009. The loans are \nplanned to be fully utilized by the Government by 31 December 2009. \n \n3.  Disbursement, Procurement, and Fiduciary Arrangements \n38.  Disbursement and Procurement. Loan proceeds will be used to pay for items procured \nin ADB member countries, other than the items specified in the negative list of ineligible items \n(Appendix 4) and imports financed by other bilateral and multilateral sources. The proceeds of \nthe program loan will be disbursed upon effectiveness in accordance with the ADB\u2019s simplified \ndisbursement  procedures  and  related  requirements  for  program  loans.  Loan  proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the Government stipulating that the \nvalue of the total imports of Georgia during a relevant 1-year period, minus its imports from \nnonmember countries, ineligible imports, and imports financed under other official development \nassistance, is equal to or greater than the amount of the loan expected to be disbursed during \nsuch period. Retroactive financing of eligible expenditures under the Program will be permitted \nup to 180 days prior to the loan signing. ADB reserves the right to audit the use of loan \nproceeds to verify the accuracy of the Government\u2019s certification.  \n39.   Fiduciary Arrangements. Georgia has made important progress in the last few years in \nimplementing  public  financial  management  reforms,  which  significantly  reduce  fiduciary \nconcerns for partner organizations engaged in budget support operations. These reforms have \nbeen a core component of the Government\u2019s anticorruption strategy. During the past 5 years, \nGeorgia has strengthened public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency by adopting \nand  implementing  reforms  that  cut  across  public  expenditure  and  financial  management, \nfiduciary controls, public procurement, public administration, and the civil service. Reforms also \nincluded  adoption  and  implementation  of  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework, \nimplementation of a treasury single account and the restructuring of the Chamber of Control into \na supreme audit institution. Implementation of these reforms helped reduce the national and \n ", "14  \ninternational perceptions of corruption. For example, according to the World Bank Institute\u2019s \ngovernance indicators, Georgia\u2019s control of corruption has improved.11\n \n40.  Georgia\u2019s  public  expenditure  management  systems  continue  to  be  used  for  budget \nsupport operations financed by the World Bank and the EU, and regular reviews have confirmed \nthese systems to be sufficiently robust from a fiduciary standpoint. ADB also considers the \npublic financial management, control, and reporting arrangements of the Government to be \nacceptable  and  adequately  complemented  by  the  regular  state  budget  execution  reporting \nmechanisms to Parliament. The Chamber of Control, the supreme audit institution of Georgia \nwhich  reports  directly  to  Parliament,  undertakes  an  annual  audit  of  all  public  expenditure \nprograms. \n  \n41.  Concerted public financial management reforms have been underway, with support from \ndevelopment partners. Based on progress made and the budget implementation systems in \nplace, the fiduciary risks of providing budget support to Georgia are considered acceptable. \nNevertheless, as the Program will provide budget support, ADB will focus on:12\n \n(i)      monitoring budget execution, and in-depth reporting of specific key expenditure \nitems (still to be defined by ADB and the Government) to ensure that these are \nimplemented as in the original 2009 budget;     \n(ii)      internal controls and audits for the specific key expenditure items; and \n(iii)     monitoring  of  procurement  or  contracting  of  services  related  to  these  key \n  expenditure areas and programs. \n   \n42.  A financial management specialist, to be recruited through proposed regional technical \nassistance (footnote 15), will be engaged to work closely with the Government to implement its \ncrisis budget effectively. ADB's support will be closely coordinated with that of the World Bank. \n \n43.    The Ministry of Finance, with NBG assistance, will maintain records of all transactions \nbetween the FCA and the Treasury single account during the Program\u2019s duration, in accordance \nwith sound accounting practices. ADB reserves the right to request an audit of the use of \ncounterpart funds, and in addition will receive a copy of the annual audited financial statements \nof the NBG together with the audited budget execution reports for 2009. The IMF has initiated \nan updated safeguards assessment of the NBG in connection with the SBA.13 The IMF update \naims to confirm the findings of the off-site monitoring and to identify any emerging safeguards \nissues.  The  NBG  publishes  financial  statements  that  have  been  audited  externally  in \n                                                 \n11 World Bank. 2008.

With crisis-support programs \nbeing planned in Armenia, Georgia and Tajikistan, the technical assistance will help across the region in public \nexpenditure monitoring and help develop and maintain sound audit trails. \n13 IMF staff monitoring since the first safeguards assessment in 2002 indicates that the NBG continues to comply with \nkey safeguard requirements. During the 2004 assessment, the IMF was encouraged by the measures taken by \nNBG  to  strengthen  procedures  in  the  areas  of  financial  reporting,  internal  audit,  and  cash  management. \nNonetheless, staff noted further room for improvement in these areas, as well as weaknesses in aspects of the \ninternal control environment of NBG, particularly in the foreign exchange management and accounting functions. \nTogether, the IMF and NBG devised and agreed on a set of measures to improve and strengthen the NBG\u2019s \nfiduciary arrangements. After update reviews in 2005 and 2006, the IMF was satisfied that the NBG had fully \nimplemented all but three of the measures agreed upon in 2002.  ", " 15\naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. The overall fiduciary risks are \nconsidered acceptable, taking into account the arrangements in place.   \n \n4.  Anticorruption Policy \n44.  ADB's Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the Government. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Program. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations. \n \n45.  The regional technical assistance being processed will help monitor public expenditure \nand provide feedback on any general or specific fiduciary concerns, in addition to the fiduciary \narrangements described above. \n   \n5.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n46.  The  JNA  includes  transitional  results  frameworks  for  the  social  sectors,  including \nexpected outcomes, baseline data, and priority activities. Baseline indicators and targets have \nbeen incorporated into the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The Office of the \nPrime Minister oversees the overall status of the JNA. ADB will coordinate closely with the \nGovernment and other JNA development partners on the status of targets and indicators under \nthe design and monitoring framework. \n \n47.  To enable the monitoring of implementation of outputs, the key budget expenditure items \nthat the Program is trying to insulate from negative shocks will be made explicit in the loan \ncovenants. In addition, loan covenants will require that the government will not allow arrears on \npayments to vulnerable groups (e.g., pensioners) and public servants associated with critical \npublic services (e.g., education, health services, law and order). \n \nVI.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n48.  Together with the parallel budget support being extended in 2009 by the World Bank and \nthe European Union, the Program will relax the current constraints on a fiscal policy response to \nthe current crisis. The counterpart funds generated from the loans will help the Government \nmeet critical budget public expenditures needs and to implement the countercyclical fiscal \nmeasures already included in the 2009 budget. Development partner indications of project \nfinance support have been substantial but these pledges often take time to be translated into \ndelivery of resources. Flexible and timely financing under the Program is essential to address \nthe budgetary needs of a countercyclical fiscal policy and reduce the risks of the economic \ndownturn.  \n \n49.  The Program will join initiatives by other development partners designed to help the \nGovernment prevent the economy from getting locked into a downward, negative growth spiral \nthat could affect social and political stability. A protracted economic downturn would also affect \nthe  medium-term  growth  potential  of  Georgia\u2019s  economy,  and  could  reverse  the  poverty \nreduction achievements of the last few years. \n \n \n ", "16  \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n50.  The last two quarters have revealed signs of fragility in the financial sector and resource \nshortfalls that may prevent fiscal and monetary policies from mitigating the current negative \nshocks to economic activity. These signs of fragility highlight the importance of the multi-year \nplan of physical investments and improvements in safety nets designed during the JNA exercise \n(which covers a 3-year period), funded by the Government and its development partners. The \nJNA is the only feasible framework for a policy response to the crisis. This puts more pressure \non Government's capacity to lead and coordinate the multi-development-partner effort. Also, the \nnarrowness of options for large-scale resource mobilization frameworks is a natural source of \nrisk.  \n \n51.  The Government launched the JNA within days of the outbreak of the August 2008 \nconflict to ensure that there was a clear strategy for keeping the focus on reforms and to secure \nthe necessary resources for remaining on track. At the same time, the Government worked with \nthe several development partners to ensure there was a 3-year timeframe for the JNA. This \ndemonstrates the Government's capacity to act quickly in the face of major challenges, as \nhighlighted in the recent review of the JNA:  \"the Government has managed the recovery and \nreconstruction effort with skill and determination and the results on the ground have been highly \nencouraging.\u201d  \n \n52.  In parallel, It is key to focus policy efforts on reducing the risk of a loss of confidence in \nthe financial system. Such a loss of confidence, especially if it unfolded in a disorderly and \nuncontrolled manner, could add a whole new dimension of disruption to the economy, and \nhamper the country's development prospects. The monetary and financial sector authorities are \ntaking measures to strengthen their trouble shooting, stress-testing, pre-emptive and remedial \naction capabilities. These are now policy reform priorities in Georgia and the commitment shown \nto improve risk mitigation is reassuring. \n \n53.  Economic policy must therefore find ways not only to act countercyclically (within the \nlimitations imposed by the widespread use of the US dollar in the economy), but to avoid \nbanking sector crisis. It is crucial that the liquidity issues in specific banks do not affect overall \ndepositor confidence in the system. The covenants in the Loan Agreement are designed to deal \neffectively with these risks, and to complement ongoing technical assistance efforts. \n \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n54.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents.  \n \n(i)  The Government will work with ADB and other JNA development partners to \nmonitor results, track aid, and assess the impact of support under the JNA. \n(ii)  The Government will update ADB on the implementation of the JNA and will \nensure that necessary support is provided to ADB to review and monitor the \nstatus of key indicators under the design and monitoring framework.  \n(iii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  counterpart  funds  are  used  to  sustain \ndelivery of the Government\u2019s core publicly funded program, in compliance with its \npublic finance management procedures and reporting arrangements, satisfactory \nto ADB, and that such counterpart funds are not used to finance ineligible items \nas set forth in Appendix 4, and shall provide a certificate to ADB to this effect. \n(iv)  The Government will, in particular, ensure the use of the Counterpart Funds \nand/or  provision  of  necessary  budgetary  funds  for  the  priority  budgetary ", " 17\nexpenditure items as identified in the 2009 state budget including the following: \nconstruction and rehabilitation of housing for internally-displaced persons (IDPs), \nroad infrastructure improvement, secondary schools, state pensions, salaries and \nacademic stipends, social support and health programs, IDPs allowances, as \nwell as budget transfers to municipalities and local governments for purposes of \nfunding such priority items. \n(v)  The Government will through relevant ministries and agencies: (a) introduce \nregulatory  framework  mitigating  systemic  banking  risks,  (b)  complete \nimplementation of the real-time gross settlement system, (c) develop operational \nframework for foreign currency auctions, (d) design foreign exchange dealing \nsystem,  all  satisfactory  to  ADB,  and  (e)  further  develop  action  plan  for \nmaintaining  financial  and  macroeconomic  stability  with  clear  division  of \nresponsibilities among Borrower's relevant ministries and agencies. \n(vi)  The  Government  will  furnish  to  ADB  a  certified  copy  of  the  state  budget \nexecution report for 2009 as submitted to the Parliament by June 2010, with a \ncertified English translation of the relevant parts. The Government will furnish to \nADB a certified copy of the opinion of the Chamber of Control on such report by \nNovember 2010, with a certified English translation of the relevant parts. \n(vii)  The Government will provide ADB with a certified copy, in the English language, \nof  the  externally  audited  annual  report  of  the  National  Bank  of  Georgia  in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards for the fiscal year of \n2009 by June 2010. \n(viii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) are complied with in implementation of \nactivities financed from the proceeds of the loan. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n55.  I  am  satisfied  that  the  proposed  program  loans  would  comply  with  the  Articles  of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 32,111,000 \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period of \n8 years and 1.5% per annum thereafter, and a term of 24 years, including a \ngrace period of 8 years; and \n   \n(ii)   the loan in various currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 19,267,000 \nwith an interest charge at the rate of 1.6% per annum during the grace period \nand for each interest period thereafter and a term of 24 years, including a grace \nperiod of 8 years \n \nboth to Georgia for the Growth Recovery Support Program from ADB\u2019s Special Funds \nresources; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with \nthose set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \nPresident \n \n15 June 2009 \n ", "18   Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources  Assumptions and Risks  \n  and/or Indicators  and/or    \n  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \n  Real  GDP  growth  is  Department of   \nPartial  mitigation  of  the  adverse  sustained at an average of  Statistics,  Investor and consumer \neconomic  and  social  impact  of  the  more than 4% over 2009\u2013 Government of  confidence returns \nglobal  economic  crisis  and  2012  Georgia  Global credit crisis fades away \nrevitalization of the Georgian economy      and international FDI flows are \nback to pre-crisis trajectory of growth  (i.e.  higher  economic  Ministry of  reestablished \nand social development   growth than otherwise;  Finance   \n  lower  poverty  than    Risks \n  otherwise;  less  impact    Regional tensions \nfrom the current drought in   \ncapital inflows on medium-\nterm growth potential) \nOutcome      Assumptions \n  The structure and amounts     \nThe proposed Program will, in tandem  of Key Public Expenditure  Department of  Budgetary support from \nwith  other  development  partners'  Items  are  executed  as  Statistics,  development partners \nbudget  support,  help  Georgia  budgeted (2009 Budget) in  Government of  FSA and NBG are effective in \nimplement  a  countercyclical  fiscal  December 2008.

Pre-Crises Record \n \n1.  In the recent past, Georgia\u2019s economy has been successful at weathering external \nshocks1 and maintaining high growth. Driven by rapidly rising foreign direct investment (FDI) \nflows, economic growth averaged 10.5% per year over the last 3 years and reached 12.4% in \n2007. This is attributable to the favorable impact of the broad and credible economic and \ngovernance reform agenda being implemented in Georgia since 2003. Over the last 5 years, \nGeorgia has implemented far-reaching strategic reforms centered on anticorruption measures \nthat have established strong mechanisms of accountability and transparency in government. \nThe reforms aim at developing a dynamic and competitive private sector as the main engine of \ngrowth, with the state playing a supportive role by providing basic public goods and services\u2014\nas seen in improvements in education and health care delivery and the introduction of a well-\ntargeted social safety net to protect the extreme poor. Privatization efforts have been very \nsuccessful in attracting foreign interest and significant capital inflows, which resulted in an \nexpansion in economic activity in a range of non-tradable sectors. From financial services to \nwholesale and retail trade, construction, hotels and restaurants, and communications, a number \nof service sectors benefited significantly from the rising household incomes and the ongoing \ndeepening of consumer lending (Figure A2.1). In 2007, strong inflows of FDI (Figure A2.2) and \nworkers\u2019 remittances from abroad continued to accelerate the investment and consumption \ncomponents of aggregate demand (Figure A2.3), bringing economic growth to 12.4%, and the \nhighest rate of the last decade. \n \nFigure A2.1: Sectoral Composition of the Economy \n \n70\n \n60\n \n50\n \n40\n \n30\n \n20\n \n10\n0\n89 \u201891 \u201893 \u201895 \u201897 \u201899 \u201801 \u201803 \u201805 \u201807\nManufacturing, value added (% of GDP) \nAgriculture, value added (% of GDP) \nServices, etc., value added (% of GDP) \nConstruction-related Industry, value added (% of GDP)\nGDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: World Development Indicators online database (World Bank, \ndownloaded 18 September 2008).   \n \n                                                 \n1  For example, in 2006, all exports from Georgia to the Russian Federation were banned by Russian authorities \n(e.g., wine, mineral water, and numerous agricultural products) and the Georgian economy had to cope with a \nsharp increase in the cost of imported gas from the Russian Federation.

Prudent monetary policies and fiscal reforms in the past 5 years have contributed to \nmacroeconomic stability. The capital inflow bonanza helped finance the large current account \ndeficit, and the buildup of foreign exchange reserves cushioned against shocks affecting the \ncurrent and capital accounts of the balance of payments. In view of the significant dollarization \nof the economy and incomplete lending channels for effectiveness of traditional monetary policy \ntools,  the  Government\u2019s  main  macroeconomic  stabilization  strategy  had  been  to  pursue \nexchange rate stabilization. This was made possible by the expanding size of foreign exchange \nreserves initiated in 2003 (Figure A2.4).  \n \nFigure A2.4: Official Foreign Exchange Reserve Accumulation  Figure A2.5: Structure of Balance of Payments \n(all figures are net of income earned) \n \n1,600,000,000  3  1 5%\n \n1,400,000,000 \n2.5 10%\n1,200,000,000 \n2 5%\n1,000,000,000 \n     \n800,000,000  1.5 0%      \n\u201897  \u201898 \u201899  \u201800 \u201801  \u201802  \u201803  \u201804 \u201805 \u201806 \u201807\n600,000,000 \n1 -5%\n400,000,000 \n0.5 -10%\n200,000,000 \n0 0 -15%\n\u201895\u201896 \u201897 \u201898 \u201899 \u201800 \u201801 \u201802 \u201803 \u201804 \u201805 \u201806 \u201807\nTotal reserves minus gold (current US$)  financial account, (balance % GDP)\nTotal reserves in months of imports (RHS axis)  current account, (balance % GDP) \ncapital account, (balance % GDP) \nSource: World Development Indicators online database (World Bank, \ndownloaded 18 September 2008). \n  GDP = gross domestic product. \nSource: International Financial Statistics online database (International \nMonetary Fund, downloaded 18 September 2008). \n \n3.  Foreign equity inflows have also assisted the strong fiscal consolidation reform agenda \ninitiated in 2003, through increasing privatization proceeds. In addition, over the last few years, \nthrough strong improvements in tax revenue mobilization, the Government has been able to \nreverse  its  past  record  of  recurrent  failures  to  meet  tax  revenue  targets,  accumulation  of \ndomestic  expenditure  arrears  (including  on  pensions  and  wages),  and  cash  management \nproblems. With tax revenues increasing from 14.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003 to \n25.8% of GDP in 2007, the Government\u2019s capacity to increase social spending (to more than \n5% of GDP) assisted in establishing social safety nets, which the Government deems crucial for \nattainment of its inclusive growth and poverty reduction agenda. Much-needed spending on \npriority items (e.g., key infrastructural rehabilitation) also increased.  \n \nB.  The August Conflict \n \n4.  Following years of sustained growth, the August 2008 conflict resulted in an uncertain \nnear-term outlook for Georgia. In early 2008, most forecasts were confident that the economic \ngrowth trend of 8% for the past few years in Georgia would continue through 2008\u20132009. The \nsituation changed dramatically after the August 2008 conflict. Real GDP growth forecasts for \n ", "22  Appendix 2 \n \n2008 changed starkly to 3% against the earlier envisaged 9.0% for 2008. A key driver for this \nwas the loss in business confidence, which in turn affected FDI in key sectors like agriculture, \ntourism, and energy infrastructure. FDI inflows and related privatization revenues, as well as \nportfolio  investment  inflows,  decelerated  sharply.  Direct  economic  damage  caused  by  the \nAugust  conflict  was  estimated  by  the  Government  to  cost  the  Georgian  economy  about \n$1 billion in damaged infrastructure and environment and lost fiscal revenues and output. \n \nC.  The International Financial Crisis \n \n5.  The strong macroeconomic shock initiated with the \"Sharp Slowdown\" in capital inflows \n(both FDI and private lending) that followed the August 2008 conflict is now being amplified by \nthe slowdown in Georgian export markets (global economic slowdown) and the reduction in \nincoming remittances.2 The macroeconomic outlook for Georgia has been revised downwards, \nand remains uncertain at this stage. From an expected growth rate of 11-12.5% for 2008, as \nanticipated before the August conflict and the shocks from the international financial crisis, the \nlatest IMF estimates of 2008 GDP growth for Georgia are of 1%, and not much more for 2009 3. \nThe combination of external shocks to what were the drivers of growth in Georgia in the past \nfew years is now working its way through the economy: the collapse of demand for - and price \ngrowth in - non-tradables (the bulk of Georgian Output) that resulted from the sharp slow-down \nin  capital  inflows  is  now  decreasing  profit  margins  and  increasing  layoffs  throughout  the \neconomy.4 Pressure is naturally being put on banks' loan quality, adding to their already quite \nreduced funding options. Some sector restructuring seem to be likely in the next 1 to 2 years. \n \n6.  With  urban  unemployment  increasing  and  profit  margins  rapidly  shrinking,  the  loan \nrepayment ability of many borrowers in the economy has been seriously affected. With about \nhalf of bank loans collateralized by real estate, the possibility of a price collapse in this asset \nclass is also a worrisome, although not yet realized prospect. The ratio of non-performing loans \nin banks has increased rapidly in the past few months at the same time that the private \nwholesale debt and equity market options are now less accessible for the banking sector. The \nusual symptoms of liquidity pressures on banks can be observed, with anecdotal evidence of \nsome banks raising interest-rates on their time-deposits to secure some liquidity. The risk of \nsystemic difficulties in the financial system is still low, but non negligible. Such scenario, if \neventually unfolded, would significantly exacerbate ongoing problems and add a whole new \ndimension of disruption to the economy of Georgia.  \n                                                 \n2 The unwinding of the large macroeconomic imbalance built-in during the last 4-5 years is now in full swing. \nTriggered initially by a steep drop in FDI inflows from August 2008 onwards (from $938 million in the first half of \n2008 to $322 million in the second half), the shock is now being amplified by the slowdown in both exports and \ninflow of remittances.  \n3  The latest estimates by the Government for 2008 GDP growth are of 2.1%, and actually negative 1.5% for 2009. \nThese figures are still to be published. \n4  This is creating difficulties to the real economy, mainly to non-tradables, following the usual way of a \"Sudden-Stop\" \nin capital inflows. The usual silver lining in these episodes is brought about by the exchange-rate adjustment that \ngets the tradables sector to provide a floor to economic activity and lead the recovery, if of course it survives the \ninitial demand or financial shock. \n ", "  Appendix 2  23 \nFigure A2.6: Relative Price Growth for Tradable and Non-Tradable Output \n \nThe sharp slowdown in capital inflows causes a collapse in demand for, and price of, non-tradable output (which \nrepresents more than 70% of the Georgian economy)\u2026 \n18%\nRelative Price Growth for Tradable and Non-Tradable Output\nTHE\n16% WAR\n14%\n12%\nwth Percentages 10%\nGro 8%\nPrice \n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\nDecember-04 January-05 February-05 March-05 April-05 May-05 June-05 July-05 August-05 September-05 October-05 November-05 December-05 January-06 February-06 March-06 April-06 May-06 June-06 July-06 August-06 September-06 October-06 November-06 December-06 January-07 February-07 March-07 April-07 May-07 June-07 July-07 August-07 September-07 October-07 November-07 December-07 January-08 February-08 March-08 April-08 May-08 June-08 July-08 August-08 September-08 October-08 November-08 December-08 January-09\nTradables Non-Tradables  \n \nFigure A2.7: Consolidated Data for Banking Sector \n \n\u2026undermining creditworthiness in the economy.\n20\n \n15\n10\ns\ne\ng 5\na\nnt\ne\nc\ner\nP\n0 Jan-07 Feb-07 Mar-07 Apr-07 May-07 Jun-07 Jul-07 Aug-07 Sep-07 Oct-07 Nov-07 Dec-07 Jan-08 Feb-08 r-08Ma Apr-08 May-08 Jun-08 Jul-08 Aug-08 Sep-08 Oct-08 Nov-08 Dec-08 Jan-09\n-5\n-10\n-15\nNonperforming Loans (percent of total loans) Specific Provisions (percent of total loans)\nReturn on Assets (ROA) Return on Equity (ROE)\n \nSource: National Bank of Georgia. \n \n ", "24  Appendix 2 \n \n7.  The risk of banking difficulties has increased. It is generally recognized by participants in \nthe sector, that the growth levels in Georgian financial intermediation of the recent past will not \nbe attainable in the near future. The FSA is well aware that it is of crucial importance to make \nsure that eventual difficulties in individual banks do not trigger systemic problems. The relevant \nchallenge for Georgia (FSA) now is how to keep localized problems in any individual bank from \nbecoming widespread. These hypothetical episodes could trigger the exchange-rate pressures \nthat can further erode capital adequacy levels across all banks simultaneously, and limit the \nability of NBG to inject lari liquidity in the banking system. The NBG policy must thus find a \ndelicate balance in current circumstances. As a central bank, it should be ready to provide \nliquidity to temporarily-illiquid banks, but simultaneously mop up excess systemic liquidity to \nmake sure there's no additional pressure on the lari exchange-rate.  \n \n8.  In the current circumstances of global financial markets, there seems to be less demand \nfor lari denominated Government medium-term debt. So, unless hard-currency development \npartner assistance back-stops the expansionary fiscal effort, the erosion in the tax base (due to \nthe economic slowdown) will gradually close the policy space for the Georgian authorities to \nrespond to the situation. A fiscal stimulus response is required to counter the effect of the \nexternal shocks. However, the relatively high dollarization imposes, by construction, constraints \non the effectiveness of both fiscal and monetary policy. In the circumstances of Georgia, these \nconstraints can only be relaxed by (i) the back-stopping of hard-currency/long-term loans from \ndonors (to fund public spending and add additional foreign exchange reserves to the NBG's \ntoolbox in order to back its exchange-rate policy), and the (ii) maintenance of a stable exchange \nrate  (at  least  avoid  sharp  changes  in  lari  value).  A  pre-condition for  the  above  described \nrelaxation is to (iii) keep stability in the banking system and avoid the exacerbation of shocks \nthrough a banking crisis, as discussed above. \n \n9.  Georgian State Budget. The Government submitted the 2009 budget to Parliament in \nDecember 2008. The budget was based on an assumption of 2.0\u20132.5% economic growth for \n2009 (Table A2). Table A2 also presents budget execution in 2008 for comparison. Overall, the \nGovernment  has  tried  to  compress  recurrent  state  expenditures  (reflected  in  a  projected \ndecrease in goods and services expenditure and grants to local administration, with a small \nincrease in recurrent capital expenses and subsidies) and to increase public investment.   \n \n10.  A  key  feature  of  the  2009  budget  is  the  budgeted  draw-down  of  the  state's  cash \nbalances deposited at the NBG in the amount of GEL522.2 million. This presents risks to the \nnormal functioning of expenditure programs, which in the current circumstances should be \navoided.  This  is  the  reason  why  the  Government's  budget  for  2009  was  presented  and \napproved with a zero ex-post financing gap.  \n \n11.  Based on ADB's commitments in late 2008, $40 million had already been tentatively \nbudgeted by the Government as a new net lending item, corresponding to about GEL66.5 \nmillion. The same amount was also budgeted to take into account the World Bank's new \ndevelopment policy operation to be approved in June 2009. \n \n12.  In view of the shortfall in budget revenues already recognized for the first quarter of \n2009, and the delays in execution of some donor-funded investment projects, the Government \nhas requested several donors to increase the amounts of budget support operations being \nprocessed, and to the extent possible shift already committed project-related assistance onto \ngeneral budget assistance. The schedule submission of a revised 2009 State Budget to the \nGeorgian Parliament is in July. The execution of the first quarter already shows signs of worse \nmacroeconomic conditions than expected last December: net of tax payments made by the \n ", "  Appendix 2  25 \nMinistry of Defense for taxes due in 2008, the 2009 tax revenue collection was 11.4% below the \nsame period in 2008. \nTable A2: Georgia State Budget \n  2008   2009  \n  (execution)  (budget) \nItem  (GEL million)  (GEL million) \nTotal Revenues  5,517.6  5,510.2 \nTotal (recurrent) Expenses  5,551.6  5,252.0 \nIncrease in Nonfinancial Assets (Public Investment)     893.4     996.7 \nDecrease in Nonfinancial Assets (Privatization Proceeds)     568.8       78.3 \nTotal State Budget Balance    (358.6)     (660.2) \n \nNet Change in Financial Assets    603.6    (568.3) \n     \nof which, NBG deposit withdrawals are    (416.3)    522.2 \nNet Change in Obligations    962.2      91.9 \n     \nof which, from WB and ADBa   208.9   133.0 \nof which Eurobonds    724.0       0.0 \nof which from other borrowing sources    140.3  403.6 \nFunding    (358.6)  (660.2) \nFinancing Gap         0.0      0.0 \n( ) = negative, ADB = Asian Development Bank, WB = World Bank. \na 133 GEL million were already budgeted for in 2009, corresponding to $40 million from the World Bank and $40 \nmillion from the Asian Development Bank. \nSources: Ministry of Finance, Georgia. \n \nD.  The Policy Challenge \n13.  Macroeconomic adjustment in Georgia is underway, especially when the economy was \nrunning a 20% current account deficit and suffers a sharp slow-down in the capital inflows that \nwere funding it. A highly dollarized, small and open economy doesn't have an ample policy \nspace to fully offset major negative shocks to foreign capital-induced domestic spending. It can \nhowever  target  its  limited  policy  tools  in  the  direction  of  key  social  or  financial  stability \nobjectives. Developing countries' financial crises have always led to sharp increases in poverty \nlevels, and for significant reversals in gains made by economic growth. \n \nBox A2: Lessons from Emerging Markets \nThe relevant problem for economic policy in this sort of macroeconomic episodes is then not merely to find ways to \nact counter-cyclically (within the limitations imposed by high dollarization) in order to absorb part of the external \nshocks (by trying to expand the fiscal and monetary policy space), but above all to avoid that such macroeconomic \nadjustment is exacerbated by difficulties in the financial sector. In other words, although the primary shocks can \nimpact on the financial sector (in terms of portfolio quality and liquidity risks), it is crucial to avoid that liquidity issues \nin specific banks can at some point become problems of overall insolvency in the banking system.  \n \nHistorically, full-fledged banking crises in emerging markets have imposed high fiscal costs. To highlight the fiscal \ndimension of these challenges, it must be stated that it wouldn't be a mere issue of a funding gap in the state budget \nresulting from lower revenue proceeds and higher public spending. In general, banking sector problems have the \npotential of affecting monetary institutions in developing countries. In many cases, the recovery of assets previously \npledged by problematic banks as collateral to central banks is significantly smaller than the value of the loans (plus \ninterest) provided in the midst of the crises. On average, the length of a banking crisis is 4.5 years, at a resolution \ncost of 13.6% of GDP.5  \n                                                 \n5  Estimates were extracted from a set of ninety episodes since the 1970s till 1996 by G. Caprio and D. Klingebiel \n1996. Bank Insolvency: Cross-Country Experiences. World Bank Policy & Research Paper Number 1574. \n ", "26  Appendix 2 \n \n14.  The global liquidity crisis that has ensued since October 2008 is exerting some funding \npressures in the Georgian banking sector.6 This is adding foreign exchange liquidity concerns to \ndeteriorating loan portfolio quality conditions in banks. Several donors have been providing \nliquidity support to banks, and important international creditors have taken equity positions in \nsome of the commercial banks. The NBG and the FSA have also been relaxing liquidity and \nreserve requirements and providing some short-term liquidity support to financial institutions \n(enabled by the much-praised countercyclical stance of the recent past). \n \n15.  Aggregate  capital  adequacy  levels  in  the  Georgian  banking  system  are  high,  but \nconcerted and sound oversight needs to be ensured. In a fractional reserve system \u2013 as modern \nbanking systems are - it is literally impossible for all depositors to convert at the same time their \ndeposits into currency (irrespective of the levels of capital) unless there is some source of \nadditional  currency  to  banks.  The  latter  usually  acts  as  an  implicit  form  of  insurance  for \ndepositors. The latter would usually come from the central bank in the form of liquidity support. \nBut that is somehow limited in highly dollarized economies. Therefore, both the NBG and the \nFSA are keeping a very close oversight effort to ensure overall public confidence in the banking \nsystem. \n \n16.  The  FSA  is  taking  steps  to  further  strengthen  its  supervisory  powers.  Specifically, \neffective Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) systems need to be put in place to fit the discretionary \nneeds of the FSA. This is crucial even in good times. A fast-tracked review of the financial \nsector architecture has been done recently, with ADB assistance, to highlight essential steps, \nsuch as improving the quality of financial reporting by banks and external auditing. The FSA \nshould improve the legal foundations and the necessary financial and technical resources to \nimplement bank resolution and restructuring in an orderly fashion. These challenges come at a \ncritical juncture for the FSA. The FSA has just been set-up (less than a year ago) with new \noperational  systems  and  procedures,  with  the  expanded  responsibility  of  consolidated \nsupervision for the entire financial system, and with a (prudential) regulatory framework that is \nundergoing important adjustments. The FSA seems to require both key technical assistance as \nwell as programmatic backup to support its decisions against pressures from the industry. As \ninternational  experience  has  shown,  while  effectively  performed  financial  system  oversight \nfunctions are needed in \"good\" times, they become of key importance in times of distress. \n \n17.  Shortage of liquidity management instruments and limited fiscal space. There is \nyet no domestic public debt issuance practice in Georgia (not even short-term). As a result, the \ndynamics of public spending is effected by seasonality in fiscal revenues. This affects the \nlaunch of domestically-financed new capital expenditure projects as a fiscal response to the \neconomic slowdown. Although T-Bills were issued in the past in Georgia - as most governments \ndo for cash management purposes and as a monetary policy instrument - the auctions program \nwas discontinued in June 2005. It is now important to re-enact a new auctions framework for \nshort-term liquidity management of the Georgian Treasury and the banking sector. This could \nbe done quickly, and would also provide a much-needed platform for operational coordination \nwith monetary policy in these difficult times. Without this additional form of collateral in the \nhands of banks (t-bills instead of lari cash), the effectiveness of the NBG's short-term liquidity \nwindow to assist banks in their liquidity management is limited (only foreign exchange and NBG \nCertificates of Deposit can currently be accepted as collateral by the NBG's weekly refinancing \nfacility). \n                                                 \n6  Although foreign net private equity and lending inflows to banks had been around $681 million in the first half of \n2008, they were negative in the second half of 2008, and are now expected to remain relatively low throughout \n2009. \n ", "  Appendix 2  27 \n \n18.  Exchange-Rate Policy Trade-Offs and Operational Issues. The NBG is now faced \nwith the challenge of smoothing steep variations in the exchange-rate and at the same time \navoiding the erosion of its foreign exchange reserves stock. The operational framework that the \nNBG used in the recent past for its exchange rate interventions was ineffective and added a \ngreat deal of uncertainty to policy, as it didn't allow NBG policymakers to distinguish between \nequilibrium changes in the exchange-rate and the sheer speculation by banks and foreign \nexchange traders against the lari. Important changes to this operational framework have already \nbeen implemented. A framework for foreign exchange auctions has been introduced in March \n2009. A multi-pricing auctions system and a normal dealing platform for all foreign exchange \ntrades is being developed. \n \n19.  Settlement  Limitations  and  Settlement  Failure-Induced  Liquidity  Risks. Another \nchallenge in the context of the operational infrastructure of the financial system is to avoid that \nany failures in settling payments between banks can trigger liquidity shortages in individual \nbanks. The current payment system (no systems of substance other than the inter-bank RTGS, \nwhich is of outdated technology, with limited linkages, and can be prone to delays) has been \noperating with limitations and not without problems. It hasn't been critically important to upgrade \nup  to  now  because  volumes/values  in  the  system  were  fairly  small.  But  in  the  current \ncircumstances, it is crucial to assure the participants in the payment system of a low settlement \nrisk. Any liquidity shortage in a bank can be mistaken by depositors as a solvency issue, and \ntrigger loss of confidence in the overall payment system. The finalization of the New-RTGS \nImplementation Plan is a priority of the NBG. This is key as well in terms of NBG's role in \nmanaging the current situation. The current system lacks some necessary features, like the \nability  to  automatically  provide  intra-day  (or  overnight  if  necessary)  liquidity.  The  NBG  is \ncurrently upgrading its payments system which will substantially improve the reliability, usability \nand speed of domestic payments. \n \nE.  Debt Sustainability \n \n20.  In  November  2006,  the  World  Bank  and  the  International  Monetary  Fund  jointly \nperformed  a  debt  sustainability  analysis  to  Georgia.  That  analysis  (the  2006  Joint  DSA) \nhighlighted what had been the key achievements of the Georgian authorities in reducing the \nburden of its external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt from a level of about 80% of \nGDP in 1994, to less than 30% at the end of 2005.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "28  Appendix 2 \n \nFigure A2.8: Debt Indicators \n25 80\n70\n20\n60\n50\n15\n40\n10\n30\n20\n5\n10\n0 0\n7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n9 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nR R R R R R R R R R R\nY Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y\nDebt service (PPG and IMF only, % of exports, excluding workers' remittances) (LHS\naxis)\nExternal debt stocks (% of GNI) (RHS axis)\nCentral government debt, total (% of GDP) (RHS axis)\n \nIMF = International Monetary Fund, GNI = gross national income, GDP = \ngross domestic product, LHS =  left-hand side, PPG =  public and publicly \nguaranteed, RHS = right hand side.                                . \nSource: World Development Indicators. \n \n21.  With the exception of a hike in debt burden indicators during 1999 owing to the effects \non economic growth from that year's Russian economic crisis and the consequent and sharp \ndepreciation of the Gel against the US dollar, the decade-long trend of external debt reduction is \nclearly very strong.

In 1998, about 23% of export receipts were needed to service the PPG \ndebt (see Graph above), but by 2007 that ratio was only 4%. Several factors determined this \noutcome:  \n \n(i)  strong economic growth;  \n(ii)  restrained and more rationalized Government borrowing towards a higher degree \nof concessionality, in the sense that the past practice of resorting to expensive \nbilateral debt was discontinued and multilateral assistance was privileged as a \nbudget funding source; and  \n(iii)  a reschedule of the repayment of liabilities to Turkmenistan related to the energy \nbill.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  29 \n22.  As a result of these debt policy and macroeconomic achievements, in 2006 the DSA \nconsidered Georgia's debt distress risk to be low, with no expected changes to this outlook \naccording to the projections and assumptions made on that exercise. It also pointed out that \n\"the CPIA for Georgia (had) been upgraded from medium to strong performer in June 2006 due \nto the recent improvement in the policy and institutional performance\".  \nFigure A2.9: CPIA Debt Policy Rating (1 = low to 6 = high) \n \n6\n5\n4\nGeorgia \nKyrgyz Republic \nMoldova 3\nSri Lanka\nTajikistan\nZimbabwe  2\n1\n0\n2005  2006  2007\n \nSource: World Development Indicators. \n23.  The  same  exercise  did  however  make  explicit  that  some  debt  indicators  remained \nvulnerable  to  stress  testing  of  key  variables.  Although  most  scenarios  tested  (in  terms  of \ndifferent potential shocks) would not jeopardize Georgia's debt sustainability, the NPV of debt-\nto-exports ratio seemed particular sensitive to a temporary decline of export value growth \n(Georgia's main export commodity was scrap metal, which is particularly prone to price swings, \nand other export items such as Georgian wine, mineral water, tea and citrus fruits had just been \naffected by a Russia imposed import ban). Nonetheless, the main source of risk to fiscal \nsustainability identified in the 2006 Joint DSA was an unexpected decline in GDP growth, \nreason why the exercise's recommendation was for the authorities to \"continue (strengthening) \ncompetitiveness  of  their  tradable  sector  and  (improving)  the  business  climate  to  support \nbaseline growth.\" \n \n24.  2007  was  a  year  of  strong  economic  growth,  and  all  near-term  economic  growth \nprospects deemed debt-sustainability to remain a non-issue, especially given the expectation \nthat the Government would continue its practice of borrowing at high concessional terms. The \nstrong  macroeconomic  shocks  caused  by  the  August  2008  conflict  and  the  international \nfinancial crisis have jointly resulted in a sharp slowdown in capital inflows (both FDI and private \nlending). These shocks are being amplified by the slowdown in Georgian export markets (global \neconomic  slowdown)  and  the  reduction  in  incoming  remittances.  All  major  components  of \naggregate demand in the economy are thus contracting and the macroeconomic outlook for \nGeorgia has been revised downwards, remaining at this stage uncertain. From an expected \n ", "30  Appendix 2 \n \ngrowth rate of 11-12.5% for 2008, as anticipated before the August conflict and the domestic \nimpact of the international financial crisis in the last quarter of 2008, the 2008 GDP growth \noutcome is 2.1%, and the current forecast for 2009 is of negative growth. \n \n25.  These compounding shocks called for renewed monitoring of macroeconomic conditions \nand further debt scenario testing. In September 2008, the IMF staff updated the 2006 Joint \nDSA, into an External and Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis (the 2008 DSA). This 2008 \nDSA also attempted at incorporating a shift in the debt management policy of the Government \nto  reflect  the  fact  that the  Government  had  earlier  in  the  year  undertaken  a  $500  Million \nEurobond issuance.  \n \n26.  A DSA done in September 2008 and an update undertaken in March 2009 by the IMF \nshow  that  Georgia's  external  debt  is  low.  Although  external  financing  for  post-conflict \nreconstruction  may  increase  the  debt  ratios  over  the  next  two  years,  the  debt  outlook  is \nexpected to recover and improve over the medium term. Georgia's key medium-term risks \ninvolve large debt service in 2012\u20132013 associated with the repayments to the IMF under its \nrecent SBA and the 2008 Eurobond. \n \n27.  Despite the substantial external financing in 2008\u201310, the low initial indebtedness and \nthe concessionality of official inflows limit the risk that debt levels will become unsustainable. \nRoughly  40  percent  of  official  financing  is  expected  in  grants,  and  some  loans  are  on \nconcessional terms. As a result, public external debt is projected to peak at around 30 percent \nof GDP in 2011 with its NPV amounting to 78 percent of exports. Although nominal private \nsector external debt is set to remain broadly constant in 2009, debt ratios will rise on account of \nthe economic contraction and exchange rate depreciation. Assuming an improvement of global \ncredit conditions in 2010, the private sector should regain capital market access, resulting in a \ngradual build-up of private debt. In terms of debt management, 2013 appears to be the most \nchallenging  year,  as  the  $500  million  Eurobond  matures  and  repurchases  under  SBA \nobligations peak. \n ", "   \nFigure A2.10: Economic Events in Georgia \n \n \n \n \n \n[This information was deemed confidential according to exceptions #6 and #18 of paragraph 126 of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy (2005)]. \n \n     \nA\np\np\ne\nn\nd\nix\n 2\n \n3\n1\n ", " \n \n3\nFigure A2.11: Problem Tree  2\n \n \n \nA\n  p\np\ne\n  n\nd\n  ix\n 2\n   \n \n \n \n \n[This information was deemed confidential according to exceptions #6 and #18 of paragraph 126 of ADB\u2019s Public Communications \nPolicy (2005)]. \n ", "  Appendix 3  33 \nDEVELOPMENT PARTNERS MATRIX  \n \nSector/Thematic \nArea  Activities \nGovernance  World Bank.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government\u2019s Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program aims to raise the welfare of the population \nin Georgia. To achieve this goal, two self-enforcing and strategic objectives have been defined: (i) fast and sustainable \neconomic development, and (ii) reduction of poverty. To achieve these strategic objectives, the Government\u2019s priorities \ninclude (i) improvement in governance (including improvement in public administration and reduction of corruption), \n(ii) macroeconomic stability, (iii) improvement in the structural and institutional environment (including improvement in \nthe business and investment climate), (iv) development of human capital through improving health conditions, and \n(v) improving living standards for those below the poverty line and reducing vulnerability levels.  \n \nThe current threats to macroeconomic stability represent a risk to the sustainability of progress along the remaining \nreform priorities of the Government. Social instability and spillover effects to political uncertainty can jeopardize past \ngrowth and poverty reduction achievements, as well as past and still ongoing progress in institutional reforms. The \nProgram will help cushion the impact on the expenditure program (structure, levels and rhythm) from the negative \nrevenue shocks, by ensuring that: (i) incremental expenditure needs arising from worse-than-expected economic \nconditions in mid-2009 are met by the Government without complete withdrawal of cash balances at the National Bank \nGeorgia, and (ii) the delivery of the core Government expenditure program for 2009 in accordance with the approved \nbudget, irrespective of any subsequent revisions to take into account potential shortfalls in revenue. In the current \ncircumstances, to avoid a free fall in economic activity, the countercyclical fiscal policy that the Program aims to \nsupport is directly in line with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy objectives.  \n \nThe poverty reduction strategy of the Asian Development Banka (ADB) is based on three pillars: (i) pro-poor economic \ngrowth, (ii) social development, and (iii) good governance. ADB\u2019s interim operational strategy for Georgia (2008\u2013\n2009),b approved in January 2008, focuses on (i) improving service delivery in municipal infrastructure within the \nevolving decentralization process, (ii) reducing road transportation constraints on economic activity, and (iii) upgrading \nand developing energy infrastructure. These priorities were identified based on the following considerations: (i) \nalignment with the Government\u2019s development agenda, (ii) selectivity in focusing limited resources on a small number \nof priority areas, and (iii) complementarity with other development partners. The interim operational strategy also \nhighlights the need for ADB to be responsive to rapid changes in circumstances, and the flexibility of ADB assistance \nmodalities\u2014a key advantage for Georgia\u2019s development under its newly established partnership with ADB.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \n \nUsing consumption as a welfare indicator and following World Bank methodology for poverty measurement, 23.6% of \nGeorgians were found to be poor and 9.3% very poor. The rural population was poorer than the urban: 29.7% versus \n18.3% for overall poverty and 12.4% versus 6.7% in the case of extreme poverty. Poverty in Georgia is thus \npredominantly rural\u2014it makes 59% of the total poor and 62% of the extreme poor. The incidence of poverty varies \nconsiderably across Georgia. The highest incidence is observed in Shida Kartli (59.4%), followed by Kakheti (46.3%), \nand Mtskheta-Mtianeti (40.6%). The lowest incidence of poverty is found in Tbilisi (12.9%), Samegrelo (14.4%), and \nKvemo-Kartli (17.3%). Employment status is strongly correlated with poverty. Households headed by wage earners \nexperience the lowest rates of overall poverty (12.7%) and extreme poverty (4.4%). Among the employed, households \nheaded by the self-employed in agriculture face the highest poverty risk. In contrast, households headed by someone \nwho is unemployed or out of the labor force face a substantial risk of poverty. \n \nAn assessment of the impact of economic growth and social spending on poverty from current shocks is under way. \nOfficial poverty indicators show some improvement over 2005\u20132007, with the overall poverty rate declining from 24.1% \nin 2005 to 23.3% in 2006 and 21.3% in 2007. However, the quality of the data is a concern, stemming partly from rapid \nturnover in staff in the Statistics Department. As a cross-check, the World Bank and the Ministry of Labor and Social \nProtection conducted a living standards measurement survey in Fall 2007, and preliminary analysis of the results \nshows an overall poverty rate of 23.6% for 2007. A full poverty assessment to be undertaken in FY2009 is tasked to \n ", "36  Appendix 5 \n \ndiscuss the differences, and suggest strategic policy and investment options for poverty reduction efforts. However, \nsome observations can be made at this time. The rapid increase in social spending, including the introduction of the \ntargeted social assistance program in 2006, has likely improved the situation of the extreme poor. Additionally, poverty \nappears to be more concentrated in rural areas and secondary cities. \n \nThe conflict that erupted in August 2008 has resulted to an additional 130,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), of \nwhich about 40,000 may not be able to return to their homes in the conflict zone. In addition, around 150,000 people \nliving on farms on the agricultural plain north of Gori are suffering from severe crop and livestock losses because \nirrigation water was cut off and other conflict-related damage. Preliminary estimates point to unemployment increasing \nfrom 13.3% in 2007 to 15.1%\u201317.4% in 2008. The shock from the international financial crisis is likely to have deeper \nand more widespread social effects though. These are however difficult to quantify. The near-term outlook is of a rise in \nunemployment, with a likely increase in overall poverty incidence. People who are already poor might be pushed \ndeeper into poverty, thus increasing the overall poverty gap and severity of poverty. The several scenarios of social \nand poverty impact estimated in the JNA are being revised and will be presented for reference in further versions of \nthis RRP.  \n \n2. Design Features \n \nThe Program is, as pro-poor in design and impact as the Government's Budget Execution for 2009 will be, and the \nlatter is in alignment with the Joint Needs Assessment (JNA) carried out jointly by Government and donor partners in \n2008. In view of the current macroeconomic circumstances, both the JNA and the Government's budget layout a \nprogram of expenditures that includes both the strengthening of safety-nets, but also expenditure items that can \nmaximize employment generation, and mitigation of poverty impacts from the ongoing crisis. \n \nThe JNA identifies the need for intervention and donor assistance in three major areas: (i) help the Government ensure \nthat critical economic and social needs are met and confidence is maintained, with budget support (through quick \ndisbursement) to back-stop countercyclical fiscal measures  with rapid effect; (ii) support for critical new public \ninvestments; and (iii) resettlement of internally displaced persons and the post-conflict needs of affected populations \nare likely to continue requiring significant support. In accordance with the JNA, certain high-value and high-yield \ninvestments are key to maximize recovery prospects with lasting positive effects on the economy's productive capacity. \n \nThe country urgently needs resources to adopt counter-cyclical fiscal policies. Given that the fiscal stimulus plans \nembodied in the JNA and envisaged for 2009 in the Government's 2009 Budget were designed within a clearly \ncountercyclical conceptual framework, and several monetary and debt market constraints in Georgia dictate that only \nquickly-disbursed donor assistance in the form of hard currency budget support can help materialize those plans, the \nherein proposed operation is an optimal fit to the circumstances. \n \nThe key elements of Georgia\u2019s social protection system are summarized below. \n \nTargeted social assistance. In August 2006, following 18 months of intense institutional development and capacity \nbuilding, the Government of Georgia introduced a targeted social assistance (TSA) system. The system uses a proxy-\nmeans testing methodology for assessing and ranking the welfare of households, which have registered with the \ndatabase on the poor and vulnerable population established and managed by the State Agency for Administration of \nSocial Transfers. The agency\u2019s database currently contains data on 42% of all households in Georgia. \n \nAll of these households had registered with the agency as households in need of support. They were visited by a \nqualified social worker who collected data on the household\u2019s economic and social status, the data was electronically \nverified and cross-checked, \u201ca score of need\u201d was automatically calculated for each household, and each household \nwas formally informed about it. Households with a score below 57,000 receive regular monthly income support. In \nAugust 2008, this benefit was received by 148,279 households with 406,718 members (10.7% of the population); the \naverage monthly benefit per household was GEL50.92. The total spending on targeted income support was budgeted \nat GEL113.1 million for 2008 (about 0.6% of projected gross domestic product). In 2007, a monitoring survey to assess \nthe performance of TSA was carried out. The survey found that TSA is efficiently administered and performs very well \nin reaching the target poor population. \n \nPensions. Georgia has a universal system of income support for the elderly, where eligibility is conditioned upon \nreaching a certain age threshold\u201460 for women and 65 for men. Other categories covered by the system are people \nwith disabilities and families that have lost a breadwinner. Benefits are flat (currently GEL70 per month), except for \nsome special categories such as war veterans, retired officers from the army and the Ministry of Interior, members of \nParliament, and others who receive much higher amounts. Overall, 838,130 people received pensions in August 2008. \nTotal spending on pensions and special categories benefits in 2008 is budgeted at GEL773.5 million (state pensions \nGEL722.7 million and special allowances GEL50.8 million). Pensions are delivered on time and the conflict has not had \n ", "Appendix 5   37\nany adverse impact on their delivery so far. \n \nMedical assistance program for the poor and vulnerable. All households that are registered with the agency and \nwhose score is below 70,000 are beneficiaries of the medical assistance program. This program is essentially a \npackage of medical services provided to beneficiaries through a publicly financed insurance premium (currently \nGEL11.2  per  capita  per  month;  projected  to  increase  to  GEL15  in  2009).  Currently,  750,000  Georgians  are \nbeneficiaries of this program. The program is funded by the state budget (for 2008, the amount is budgeted at GEL75.0 \nmillion, making up about one third of overall public spending on health in Georgia). \n \nSocial care services: The system of social care services in Georgia is limited and mostly focused on children deprived \nof parental care and children with disabilities. Georgia is in the process of implementing a child welfare reform aimed at \ndeinstitutionalization of child care. \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe social sectors in Georgia were confronted with a number of structural, institutional, policy, and governance issues \nthat needed to be addressed to improve performance and outcomes. Resources spent on social assistance programs \nwere insufficient to make a real difference to the extremely poor. Moreover, they were thinly spread over too many \nfragmented programs, targeted mostly based on status, merits (veterans and other deserving citizens), or a social \ncategory (disabled, orphans, elderly, etc.). Program implementation was weak, the staff were poorly trained and paid, \nthe record-keeping practice was outdated, benefit delivery had room for leakage, and monitoring and evaluation barely \nexisted.  \n \nEven though social transfers are not sufficient to move households out of poverty, they play an important role in \npoverty alleviation (particularly pensions as the largest program). The new Government inherited significant arrears in \npensions and other social benefit payments. In the short to medium term, major challenges facing the state pension \nsystem are (i) to continue paying pensions on time, (ii) to increase pensions to about 25%\u201330% of the average wage \n(from a replacement rate of about 20%), and (iii) to improve pension administration. In the long run, Georgia faces a \nchallenge of developing an affordable, fiscally sustainable, diversified pension system that would protect the elderly \nagainst poverty and provide for consumption smoothing. Under the new Government\u2019s program, pensions and social \nassistance benefits were significantly increased, all arrears were cleared, and payment of these benefits commenced \non a regular basis. In pensions, a strategy for long-term pension reform was adopted, and the corresponding legal \nframework was created for an affordable, equitable, and fiscally sustainable protection of the elderly against poverty. \nOverall, the pension system was simplified and streamlined. \n \nThe health sector continues to face significant challenges. Health outcomes are stagnant or are worsening. Early \nchildhood mortality and maternal mortality have yet to show a positive trend. Noncommunicable diseases are on the \nrise. Out-of-pocket expenditures for treatment are still a major barrier to seeking care. The new Government\u2019s program \naims to sustain improved health care services. Increased public financing for health care and better targeting of primary \ncare to the poor are gradually improving the utilization of health care services.  \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.  Provide a summary of the consultation and participation process during the project preparation. \n \nExtensive consultations were conducted with the Government [including the Ministry of Finance (MOF); National Bank \nof Georgia; Financial Supervisory Agency; Revenue Service]; private sector (including American Chamber of \nCommerce, Bank Republic/Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale); and other development partners (including World Bank, United States \nAgency for International Aid, German development cooperation through GTZ, European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, European Union). \n \n2.

Georgia  embarked  on  a  series  public  financial  management  reforms  in  budgeting, \naccounting and treasury management, procurement and local government budgeting. These \nreforms have resulted in the improvement of PFM indicators for Georgia, as indicated by the \nWorld Bank's Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (See Figure A6). \n \nFigure A6: Country Policy and Institutional Assessment \n6.0 \n5.0 \nst) \ne\ngh 4.0 \nhi\n= \n6  2005\nst,  3.0  2006\ne\nw 2007\no\n= l\n1  2.0 \n(\ng \nn\nati\nR\n1.0 \n- \nDebt policy  Economic  Efficiency of Equity of public Fiscal policy Public sector Quality of\nmanagement  revenue resource use management  budgetary and\nmobilization and institutions financial\n. management\nSource: World Bank, World Development Indicators database. \n \n \n \n2.  Budgeting Reforms. The centerpiece of budget reforms is the introduction of multi-year \nbudget through the development of the Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). This has \nresulted  in a  fiscal  framework  that  outlines  fiscal  projections  linked to  medium-term  policy \ndirections and economic conditions. These are contained in the published Basic Data and \nDirections  Document  (BDD).  The  BDD  for  2009-12  was  published  in  July  2008.  The \nGovernment has rolled out MTEF to all ministries, except for the Ministry of Interior. However, \nthe BDD needs further improvement and should be extended to include realistic resource \nceilings for subsequent budget planning. The BDD also needs to be more widely disseminated. \nThe MTEF reform has also resulted in the development of performance indicators for some \nsectoral  programs.  Reforms  have  also  moved  towards  the  linkage  between  the  annual \nbudgeting and the MTEF. This has resulted in better policy content in the budget. \n \n3.  Treasury Management and Accounting Reforms. Georgia had been saddled with off-\nbudget revenues and expenditures, which in turn hampered budget execution and increased \nfiduciary risks. To address this, a Treasury Single Account for the central government was \n ", "40  Appendix 6 \n \nestablished to help track the flow of funds.  The Government also adopted Rules and guidelines \nfor Treasury operations at the central and decentralized level. \n \n4.  Treasury  reforms  were  complemented  by  accounting  reforms.  New  accounting \nstandards were likewise introduced. The Government adopted and began implementation of an \naccounting reform strategy for producing annual consolidated financial statements in line with \ninternally accepted accounting and reporting standards. Consolidated cash and commitment \nreports for the central government and large cities are now being prepared. Financial reporting \nwas further strengthened by the implementation of functional budget classifications in line with \nthe  IMF\u2019s  Government  Finance  Statistics  (GFS)  Manual  2001.  As  such,  the  Treasury \nmanagement information system is producing GFS-compliant state budget execution reports. \n \n5.  The Government has also improved its cash management systems. Treasury\u2019s rules and \nprocedures on cash planning and management have been significantly improved. Also, the \nTreasury's cash management system has been linked with National Bank of Georgia's real time \nsettlement system resulting in better predictability of available resources and its allocation to \nspending units. Also, the Government has acquired an electronic payment documents exchange \nsystem has been acquired and is currently being customized at the Treasury. The electronic \nTreasury system is now running in a pilot exploration mode and will be fully functional by the \nend of 2009  \n  \n6.  Procurement Reforms. In line with the 2007 Country Procurement Assessment, the \nGovernment has moved to enhance transparency and efficiency in the procurement process. \nGeorgia  enacted  a  new  State  Procurement  Law  which  established  the  State  Procurement \nAgency (SPA), and instituted government-wide processes for transparent procurement. For \ninstance,  the  SPA  website  discloses  information  about  procurement  practices.  Later \namendments  to  the  procurement  law  included  the  expansion  of  coverage  to  state  owned \nenterprises, streamline procedures, and adopt international practices of retroactive financing in \npublic  procurement.    The  improvement  in  the  procurement  framework  has  resulted  in  the \nfivefold increase in public tenders from 796 in 2005 to more than 3,500 in 2007.  \n  \n7.  Local Government Budgeting. The Government has also reformed local government \nbudgeting process and the system for intergovernmental fiscal transfers. A new law on Local \nSelf  Government  Budgets  was  enacted  alongside  with  the  adoption  of  a  transparent \nintergovernmental  fiscal  relations  system  in  the  budget  preparation.  The  Government  has \nstarted to roll-out of a new integrated electronic system for monitoring municipal budgeting and \nfinancial reporting. Municipalities prepared their 2008 and 2009 budgets under the new law, \nrelated  budget  rules,  and  the  electronic  system.  As  such,  the  MOF  receives  from  all \nmunicipalities\u2019 monthly reports on the execution of their budgets. \n \n8.  Public  Finance  Management  Reform  Policy  Vision  2009\u20132013.  In  2009,  the \nGovernment issued it Reform Policy Vision for Public Finance Management for 2009-2013. The \ngoals of the reforms are to: (i) maintain fiscal discipline and thereby facilitate macroeconomic \nstability and predictability of the budget system; (ii) promote a strategic approach by ensuring \nthat resources are directed toward key policy and strategy priorities; (iii) deliver value for money \nby ensuring that resources are used effectively and efficiently; and (iv) ensure accountability in \nthe use of public resources.1 Table A6.1 shows the challenges discusses the challenges being \nfaced by Georgia in key areas in public financial management. Table A6.2 shows Government's \nPublic Finance Management Reform Action Plan for 2009. \n                                                 \n1 Ministry of Finance. 2009.

The resource framework for budget \nplanning is now being determined within a medium-term \nmacro-fiscal framework, but weaknesses in forecasting \nmethodologies and capacities still need to be addressed. \nProcesses for strategic planning across government are \nstill evolving and the required skills, experience and \ntechniques need to be developed further. Achieving \ncloser integration between planning and policy \nmanagement presents organizational and management \nchallenges across government and within the ministries. \nResource ceilings that allow ministries to prioritize their \nbudget plans against a realistic estimate of future \nfinancing were introduced in 2004/05 and represent a \nkey reform. However, the analytical basis and \njustification for these resource ceilings should be \nstrengthened. The BDD is being developed so that it sets \nout with greater clarity the government\u2019s medium-term \nfiscal and public expenditure strategies and plans. \nHowever, the quality of the BDD analysis requires further \nimprovement and should be extended to include realistic \nresource ceilings for subsequent detailed budget \nplanning. The BDD should also be disseminated more \nwidely. \nBudget preparation  Despite recent progress, the links between government \npolicies and strategies and budget preparation need to \ndevelop further. The medium-term action plans have still \nto be fully reflected in budget allocations. Automated \nsystems to formulate, analyze, produce, and monitor the \nbudget are either non-existent or deficient thereby \ndecreasing the efficiency of budget staff. Basic budgeting \npractices across the government are still at a reform \nstage: (i) budget planning processes in central and \nespecially local governments (line ministries and local \nbodies) are fragile and require improvement and \nmodernization; (ii) organizational and capacity \nweaknesses in the MoF and line ministries beginning to \nbe addressed and require further facilitation. \nParliamentary discussion of the Budget continues to be \nfocused on detail rather than strategic priorities and \nneeds modernization to increase the accountability of the \nline ministries and connectivity with the Government and \nsectoral strategies. \nResource management  The processing of financial transactions is being \nimproved with the establishment of the TSA and most \nrevenues and expenditures flow through a single \nprocess. E-treasury systems are being introduced, but \nrequire further development in coverage and content to \nallow the budget organizations to exchange payment \ndocumentation with the Treasury electronically. There \nare still weaknesses in budget/cash management, which \nrequires additional attention in order to improve the \nbudget execution planning by the ministries as well as \ncash allocation planning by the MoF. Overall treasury \nexecution system needs modernization in order to meet \nrequested standards. \n \n ", "42  Appendix 6 \n \nArea  Challenges \nMobilization of financial resources has been considerably \ntransformed with: (i) significant progress made in \nstrengthening revenue administration, although further \nmeasures are required to improve the interface with \ntaxpayers, and strengthen revenue administration \ncapacities; (ii) substantial progress in reforming tax and \ncustoms legislation, policy and administration although \nthese reforms require further consolidation; and the \nstrengthening of internal and external debt management. \n \nPersonnel management processes need further attention \nin order to improve wage bill planning and management. \nInternal control  Different internal control instruments are in place and \nhave been under development over the past years. For \ninstance budget expenses commitment control \nmechanism has been introduced since 2003 and has \ncontributed to better management of public spending. \nHowever, many internal control instruments are poorly \nformulated with limited compliance and oversight. There \nis no legislative basis for internal audit. Although some \nfinancial inspection and supervision functions are \noperational, there is insufficient oversight of resource \nmanagement procedures within ministries. \nAccounting and reporting  Treasury reforms to date have focused on improving the \nrecording of transactions and were successful, however \naccounting and reporting systems and practices are not \nstandardized. Budget classification is done with GFS \nManual 2001 is used for cash transactions, while the \naccounting instructions give a different type of chart of \naccounts for accrual accounting. Accounts, particularly \nwith respect to local governments, LEPLs, other public \nentities are not consolidated and comprehensive. While \ncentral government reporting is sound improvements are \nrequired for consolidated financial reporting. Reporting \nbetween key players tends to be paper-based. This \ncontributes to delays in reporting and makes analysis by \nrecipients more difficult. There remain weaknesses in \naccounting capacities throughout Government with \nparticular challenges to be faced in establishing \naccounting and reporting practices for semi(cid:31)autonomous \nbodies, LEPLs, state owned enterprises, etc. \nNote: These are excerpts from the Public Finance Management Reform Policy Vision 2009\u20132013. \nBDD = budget directions document, GFS = government financial statistics, LEPL = legal entity of the public law, MoF \n= Ministry of Finance, TSA = treasury singleaccount. \nSource: Ministry of Finance. 2009.

In September 2008, the Government of Georgia and a multi development partner group \ncarried-out an  assessment  (the  JNA)  of  the  post-conflict  needs,  by  examining  the  various \ndimensions of damage and economic loss that resulted from the armed conflict with the Russian \nFederation  (conflict).  The  JNA  was  specifically  tasked  to  estimate  the  financial  assistance \nrequired to address the direct losses and damage, and reestablish the conditions for a return to \nsustained growth in Georgia. The JNA was put together by a core team, led by the World Bank, \nand consisting of the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations (UN)\u2014together with \ntechnical sector teams comprising representatives of these institutions, the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, \nand International Finance Corporation. The JNA draws on reports prepared by the EC of initial \nestimates of conflict-related damages and those prepared by the UN of conditions in Abkhazia \nand South Ossetia, Georgia. The teams examined (i) the macroeconomic and banking impact of \nthe  conflict,  (ii)  the  impact  on  the  social  sectors  and  on  directly  and  indirectly  affected \npopulations, and (iii) infrastructure and environment.  \n \n2.  Countercyclical Medium-term Stabilization Resource Requirements. The JNA was \ntherefore  also  tasked  to  quantify  countercyclical  medium-term  stabilization  resource \nrequirements for Georgia to avoid a protracted economic downturn in case the sudden-stop in \ncapital inflows persisted for a longer period of time. The conflict had resulted in shocks to the \nkey pillars of Georgian economic growth and financial stability, and the effects of these shocks \nwere of uncertain duration in terms of the decline in foreign direct investment and international \nlending to Georgian banks. Thus, the JNA identified areas for new physical investments for a \nworst-case scenario in which a much longer period of decline in private resource inflows would \nneed to continuously be bridged by official resource inflows. The JNA estimated the overall \nresource envelope required by this worst-case scenario from development partners to be up to \n$3.7 billion, to cover a period of 3 years. Actions required were prioritized and presented in \nthree sequential time frames: the first of 6 months (to March 2009) (immediate); a second of a \nfurther  12  months  (to  March  2010);  and  a  last  phase  of  a  further  12\u201318  months  (up  to \nSeptember 2011). This timeframe of 3 years was therefore the estimated transition period \nwhere specific actions would be required to bring Georgia to its normal path of growth as long \nas the sudden-stop in capital inflows persisted. This scenario is now confirmed by the effects of \nthe international liquidity crisis and global economic slowdown on the Georgian economy.  \n \n ", "46  Appendix 7 \n \nTable A7.1: Georgia Joint Needs Assessment - Cost Estimates  \n($ million) \n \nImmediate  Core  Core \nNeeds (to Mar  Investment  Investment \nKey Heads of Needs  2009)  (to Mar 2010)  (to Sep 2011)  Total \nA.

International  Financial  Crisis  Exacerbates  the  Macroeconomic  Adjustment. \nAlthough triggered initially by the August 2008 conflict, the steep drop in FDI inflows to Georgia \nfrom August 2008 onwards (from $938 million in the first half of 2008 to $322 million in the \nsecond half) is now likely to continue due to the global liquidity crisis and the effects on the \naggregate demand from the slowdown in both exports and inflow of remittances. The unwinding \nof the large macroeconomic imbalance built-in during the last 4-5 years is now in full swing, and \nonly expansionary fiscal policies can smooth the social consequences of this macroeconomic \nadjustment. Some external adjustment is in itself unavoidable as the sharp increase in the \nexternal  current  account  deficit  since  2003  reflected,  to  a  large  extent,  higher  imports  of \nintermediate goods related to ever-greater FDI inflows. The current account deficit is now \nexpected to decrease, but not as fast as it could happen, as import demand will now be \nincreasingly financed by official transfers. \n \n4.  The Joint-Needs Assessment as the Crisis Response Framework. In sum, as a \nframework  to  address  the  effects  from  the  international  financial  crisis  in  the  economy  of \nGeorgia, the JNA remains fully relevant as joint response plan by the Government and the multi \ndevelopment partner group. The JNA identifies the need for intervention and donor assistance \nin three major areas: (i) Support for the rapid restoration of confidence. By providing budget \nsupport to back-stop countercyclical fiscal measures, donor partners can help the Government \nensure that critical economic and social needs are met; (ii) Support for social needs. The \nresettlement of internally displaced persons and the post-conflict needs of affected populations \nare likely to require significant support; (iii) Support for critical investments. In accordance \nwith the JNA\u2019s assessment, certain high-value and high-yield investments are key to maximize \nrecovery prospects. These are recognized as \u201ccore investments\u201d in the report. Such financing \n ", "Appendix 7   47\nwould also help the country enhance economic security by broadening access and connectivity \nin energy and transport spheres. \n   \n5.  A Donor Conference was organized in Brussels, Belgium, on 22 October 2008, where \nthe  Government  formally  sought  development  partner  assistance  along  the  above  lines. \nDevelopment partners have pledged a total of $4.5 billion in support over 2008-2010, of which \n$2 billion will be in the form of grants.
