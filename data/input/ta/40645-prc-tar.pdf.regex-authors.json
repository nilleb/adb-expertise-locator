During  the  2006  Country  Programming  Mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide technical \nassistance (TA) to support government efforts to strengthen the regulatory framework for urban \nwastewater management (UWM) and solid waste management (SWM), focusing on small cities \nand towns. Fact-finding for the TA was undertaken in October 2007, and an understanding was \nreached with the Government on the impact and outcome, methodology and key activities, cost \nestimates,  financing  plan,  and  implementation  arrangements  for  the  TA.1  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Since the PRC initiated economic reforms in 1978, continuous economic growth has \nbeen accompanied by rapid urbanization. The urban population2 has grown from 160 million in \n1975 to about 577.1 million in 2006. The urbanization rate increased from 17% to 43.9% in the \nsame  period,  and  is  expected  to  reach  55%  (or  about  700  million)  in  2030.  This  rapid \nurbanization  over  the  past  three  decades  of  economic  reform  was  largely  fueled  by  the \ntransformation of suburban areas from farming to non-farming activities, and by the massive \nmigration of surplus rural labor to urban areas. The number of cities in the PRC increased from \n193 in 1978 to 661 in 2006. There are also 19,522 towns. Of the total urban population of \n577.1 million in 2006, an estimated 115.5 million live in small cities and 239.1 million in towns. \nThe combined population of small cities and towns is 354.6 million or 61.4% of the total urban \npopulation.3 The Government highlighted sustainable urbanization as a key policy priority in the \n11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2006\u20132010). \n \n3.  The enormous volume of wastewater and solid waste generated by the PRC\u2019s urban \nareas  poses  a  major environmental  threat to  the  country\u2019s  rivers,  lakes,  and underground \naquifers. In 2006, the PRC generated about 296.6 billion cubic meters of wastewater4\u2014about \n55.3% from municipal sources and 44.7% from industrial sources. Currently, about 90% of \nindustrial wastewater is treated before discharge to a municipal sewer. Municipal wastewater is \na major contributor to pollution of the PRC\u2019s rivers and lakes. As of 2006, only about 57% (34% \nin 2000) of urban wastewater was treated; the rest was discharged untreated into rivers and \nlakes. The State Environment Protection Administration maintains a network of 3,200 water \nquality monitoring stations. According to the 2004 State of the Environment Report, about 41% \nof the water in the seven major river basins5 does not meet the class III national water quality \nstandard.6 Of the 50 lakes that are regularly monitored, 13 are partially polluted, 19 are seriously \npolluted, and only 18 meet the class III standard. Surface water sources serving municipal water \nsupply systems are polluted to levels unacceptable under the current water quality standards.  \n \n4.  The amount of solid waste generated by urban areas has also expanded rapidly. In \n2006, the PRC generated 186 million tons of solid waste\u2014representing an increase of 57% over \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 21 April 2007.   \n2  The urban population in the PRC is defined as people who are officially registered residents of cities and towns.  \n3  Data for towns are adapted from \u201c2006 China Urban Development Report,\u201d and for small cities from China \nEconomic Information Network.  \n4  State Environmental Protection Administration. 2006. National Environmental Statistical Bulletin. PRC. Industrial \nwastewater made up the remaining 44.7%.  \n5  Changjiang (Yangtze River), Haihe, Huaihe, Huanghe, Liaohe, Songhuajiang, and Zhujiang.  \n6  PRC water quality standards have five classes of quality covering about 40 pollution parameters. Class I is pristine, \nwhile class V is suitable only for industrial use. Class III is the minimum water quality required for municipal water \nsupply. \n ", "2 \nthe 2001 volume of 118 million tons. However, the increase in treatment capacity has not kept \npace  with  the  increased  solid  waste  volume,  and  the  treatment  capacity  that  has  been \ndeveloped is mainly for large cities. Few small cities and towns have wastewater, solid waste, \nand hazardous waste disposal facilities. In addition to direct adverse impacts on public health, \nthe growing and uncontrolled disposal of solid waste contributes to increasing contamination of \ngroundwater supplies through inadequate leachate collection systems. There is an urgent need \nto prepare and promulgate a national policy framework and guidelines for UWM and SWM for \nsmall cities and towns in the PRC.  \n \n5.  To  arrest  the  trend  of  environmental  pollution  and  improve  the  quality  of  the \nenvironment, the Government adopted the long-term goal of building a resource-efficient and \nenvironment-friendly society, with the specific target of reducing major pollutants (including \nchemical oxygen demand) per unit of gross domestic product by 10% during the 11th FYP. \nCities are required to raise the rate of wastewater treatment to at least 70% by the end of the \n11th FYP. Between 1998 and 2005, the Government invested a total of CNY279 billion in \nwastewater  treatment  infrastructure,  involving  some  2,000  wastewater  treatment  plants.  A \nrecent  government  audit  of  these  wastewater  treatment  plants  indicated  that  one  major \nconstraint was the lack of funds for operation and maintenance (O&M) because of inadequate \ntariff levels. An additional CNY300 billion of government funding has been earmarked for UWM \ntreatment and reuse, and SWM projects for the 11th FYP. There is, therefore, an urgent need to \nimprove the effectiveness and sustainability of existing and future UWM and SWM facilities, \nthrough tariff reforms, innovative financing mechanisms, and management regimes. \n \n6.  The Government has recognized the importance of tariff reforms to raise funds for both \nconstruction and O&M of UWM treatment and SWM, and demonstrated a strong commitment \ntoward market-based reforms for UWM and SWM. The state council decision on implementing a \nscientific  approach  to  development  and  strengthening  environmental  protection,  issued  in \nDecember 2005, requires the implementation of tariffs for UWM and solid waste on the basis of \nfull cost recovery, and allowance of a small margin of profit. It also allows for provision of \nsubsidies by local governments for O&M of waste management facilities, when the revenues \ncannot cover the full costs.  \n \n7.  The Ministry of Construction (MOC) is responsible for developing national policies and \nguidelines  for  the  management  of  UWM  and  solid  waste,  including  waste  collection, \ntransportation, treatment, disposal, and tariff setting. MOC is also responsible for overseeing \ndevelopment plans and investments in UWM and SWM. Municipal, city, and town construction \ncommissions and environmental sanitation bureaus plan, implement, and operate UWM and \nSWM projects.   \n \n8.  The urban sector is a priority area for ADB investments in the PRC. ADB has built a \nlong-term strategic partnership with MOC over a 10-year period. The partnership is built on the \nimplementation of a series of highly relevant and successful TA projects, which focused on \nformulating national policy frameworks and guidelines for the key urban issues facing large and \nmedium cities in the PRC. In the late 1990s, ADB provided two TA projects on water tariff \nreforms. The first TA7 examined water tariffs and developed a tariff mechanism based on the \nprinciples of full cost recovery. A major output of this TA was the preparation of the National \nGuidelines on Water Tariffs (NGWT), which was promulgated by the then State Development \nPlanning Commission and MOC in September 1998. The second TA8 focused on developing \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Water Supply Tariff Study. Manila.   \n8   ADB. 1999. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Water Tariff Study II. Manila. \n ", "3 \ninstitutional capacities to implement the NGWT. Support was provided for preparing the local \nimplementing regulations of the NGWT for Chengdu, Fuzhou, and Zhangjiakou. The NGWT are \nnow being followed nationwide. In 2000, ADB approved a TA on strengthening urban SWM.9 \nCompleted in 2003, the TA assisted the Government in developing a national policy framework \nand  plans  for  urban  SWM,  refining  the  National  Guidelines  on  Solid  Waste  Tariffs,  and \nconducted related capacity building. In 2002, ADB provided a TA on Preparing the National \nGuidelines for Urban Wastewater Tariffs and Management Study.10 The TA was completed in \n2003  and  assisted  the  Government  in  refining  the  wastewater  tariff  principles,  developing \nnational  guidelines  for  wastewater  tariffs,  and  improving  UWM.  It  established  a  strong \nfoundation for the formulation of the national urban wastewater tariff guidelines for large and \nmedium cities in the PRC, which is expected to be issued in February 2008. \n \n9.  The Government has made significant progress in improving UWM and SWM. However, \npresent tariff reform efforts have focused mainly on large and medium cities. The Government \nstill faces many challenges in implementing the national wastewater and solid waste tariff \nreforms  in  small  cities  and  towns  because  of  their  special  circumstances  (e.g.,  lack  of \neconomies of scale owing to low waste volumes, low income levels of the populations, and \nweak financial capability of the local governments). There is, therefore, an urgent need to \ndevelop  and  pilot  test  the  national  policy  framework  and  guidelines  for  UWM  and  SWM, \nfocusing on small cities and towns in the PRC. The proposed TA is timely and builds on the \nachievements of the earlier TAs on water, wastewater, and SWM. The major lessons learnt from \npast successful TAs with MOC include (i) the importance of commitment and ownership from \nthe Executing Agency (EA), (ii) close interaction and cooperation between various stakeholders, \n(iii) the timing of the TA and proper synchronization between the TA and the Government\u2019s \npriorities and plans, (iv) competent and resourceful consultants who are familiar with the local \nsituation, and (v) close involvement and supervision by ADB staff.   \n \n10.  The proposed TA supports the Government\u2019s environmental improvement objectives as \nset  out  in  the  11th  FYP.  The  TA  is  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  strategy  for  the  PRC,  which \nemphasizes protection of the environment, improved wastewater, and SWM, particularly in \nurban areas. Wastewater and SWM projects are a major component of the current ADB lending \npipeline in the PRC. In particular, the TA will support the growing number of ADB investment \nprojects addressing urban environmental improvement needs in small cities and towns in the \nPRC.11   \n \nIII.   THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The  impact  of  the  TA  is  improved  UWM  and  SWM  by  developing  national  policy \nframeworks12 for wastewater and solid waste tariffs, including tariff calculation methodologies, \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2000.

This TA will prepare three investment projects focusing on \nthe small cities and towns in Hebei, Liaoning, and Shanxi provinces in the PRC. \n12  The national policy framework will identify tariff calculation methodologies and management systems that will \nallow the small cities and towns to generate funds for the construction and O&M of UWM and SWM infrastructure \nservices. ", "4 \nfocusing on small cities and towns. The outcome of the TA is an increased rate of wastewater \ntreatment and of sanitary disposal of solid waste for small cities and towns.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n12.  The TA will (i) assess the volumes and pollution loadings of UWM and solid waste of \nsmall cities and towns; (ii) develop a methodology for classification of the small cities and towns \naccording to a set of criteria including climatic conditions, technological requirements, financing \nneeds,  and  socioeconomic  conditions;  (iii)  formulate  national  tariff  policy  frameworks  on \nwastewater  and  solid  waste  for  each  category  of  small  cities  and  towns,  taking  into \nconsideration such factors as appropriate and practical technologies, affordability, financing \noptions for construction, O&M, and cost analysis of UWM and SWM facilities in selected case \nstudy small cities and towns;13 (iv) pilot test the national tariff policy frameworks with selected \ncase study small cities and towns; (v) finalize the national tariff policy frameworks on the basis \nof  the  pilot  testing;  (vi)  develop  an  institutional  framework,  capacity  building  plan,  and \ninformation dissemination program for implementing the national tariff policy frameworks; (vii) \nimplement the information dissemination program; and (viii) prepare a comprehensive policy \nnote related to UWM and SWM. A fully participatory approach will be adopted to understand the \nneeds and expectations of the stakeholders, including local communities, and maximize their \nownership and buy-in. The Government\u2019s strategy for poverty reduction in the small towns and \ncities will be reviewed, the impact of the tariff policy options on the poor will be assessed, and \nspecific measures will be proposed to ensure the poor\u2019s access to wastewater and solid waste \nservices.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,300,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $1,000,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government has agreed to provide the balance of the cost, \nequivalent to $300,000, for counterpart staff, office space, furniture, administrative support, and \nlogistics. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  MOC14 will be the EA for the TA and will coordinate with the relevant central, provincial, \nand municipal government authorities. MOC has already designated a coordinator for the TA, \nand will assign the needed counterpart staff to assist the consultants. MOC will establish a \nproject steering committee to guide TA implementation. The project steering committee will be \nchaired by the concerned vice minister for MOC, and will include the director generals of the \nDepartment of Urban Construction and Department of International Relations, and relevant \nofficers of the Ministry of Finance and the National Development Reform Commission. A local \nsteering  committee  will  be  established  in  each  selected  case  study  city  to  interact  and \ncoordinate with the project steering committee, and to provide guidance to ensure smooth \nimplementation of the TA. In addition to staff, MOC will provide a suitably furnished office with \nutilities and telecommunication access; local transport for consultants; and materials, maps, \ndata, and related documents required by the TA.  \n                                                 \n13  The case study small cities and towns will be selected by the EA before the commencement of TA fieldwork. One \nmajor selection criterion is to consider areas where future ADB projects will be implemented. Through discussions, \nthe case study cities will be finalized at TA contract negotiations.   \n14  MOC has strong capacity to implement the proposed TA based on their excellent track record in implementing the \nearlier TAs.    \n ", "5 \n \n15.  The TA will be implemented over an 18-month period beginning in April 2008 and ending \nin October 2009. The total input of consultants is estimated at 77 person-months, consisting of \n17 person-months of international consultancy and 60 person-months of national consultancy. \nThe  consultants  will  have  expertise  in,  among  other  things,  urban  development  planning; \nwastewater management, SWM, wastewater treatment technologies, SWM technologies, urban \ninfrastructure financing, tariff reforms, environmental policy analysis and formulation, economic \nanalysis, institutional analysis, and participatory approaches. The consultants will be engaged \nthrough a firm in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). ADB will select and engage the consultants on the basis of the \nquality (80%) of the proposal and the cost (20%) of the services to be provided (the quality and \ncost-based selection method). ADB\u2019s full technical proposal approach will be used to select and \nengage the consultants. The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \nTA equipment will be procured by the consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  will  be  retained  by  the  EA  upon \ncompletion of the TA.  \n \n16.  The  TA  consultants  will  submit  (i)  an  inception  report  within  1  month  of  the \ncommencement of services, (ii) an interim report at the end of the 8th month, (iii) a draft final \nreport at the end of the 16th month, and (iv) a final report within 1 month of the receipt of \ncomments from the Government and ADB on the draft final report. All of these major reports will \nbe translated into Chinese. Tripartite meetings will be held between ADB, the Government, and \nconsultants to review the inception, interim, and draft final reports.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for Urban Wastewater and Solid Waste \nManagement for Small Cities and Towns, and hereby reports this action to the Board.
