During the 2003 Country Programming Review Mission, the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) reconfirmed its request to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ntechnical assistance (TA) to prepare an environmental improvement and pollution control project \nto cover wastewater treatment and solid waste management components in various cities and \ntowns in the Hai River basin of Shandong Province (Map 1). The ADB Fact-Finding Mission \nvisited the PRC in September 2003 and reached an understanding with the Shandong provincial \ngovernment (SPG) and concerned municipal governments on the goals, purpose, output, cost \nestimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Wastewater  has  historically  been  disposed  of  through  septic  tanks,  with  effluents \ndischarged to the inland river and canal systems. Solid waste collection and disposal have been \npoorly  organized  and  are  also  environmentally  damaging.  Rapid  urban  development  and \nindustrialization and increased population density has resulted in heavy pollution of rivers, \ncanals, and open areas in urban environments, causing odor, nuisance, and high risk to health, \nparticularly by waterborne diseases. Against this background, the Government has recognized \nthat adequate environmental protection and pollution controls are preconditions for sustainable \neconomic growth and, therefore, the Green Plan emphasizes wastewater management and \npollution control, including in the Hai River basin.2  \n \n3.  The Hai River Pollution Prevention and Control Plan (HRPPCP) is an action program \nunder the Green Plan, which sets pollution control targets for 2000 and 2010, requiring that \nurban environmental pollution and ecological damage be controlled by 2010.3 ADB has provided \nsignificant assistance in the Hai River basin, including a TA to the Government to develop a \nstrategy  to  implement  HRPPCP.4 The TA built on the Government\u2019s plans by developing \nprioritized and suitably phased investment packages, and formulating financial management, \nregulatory enforcement, and institutional frameworks for pollution control. Subsequently ADB \napproved  two  wastewater  treatment  projects  in  the  Hai  River  basin  in  Tianjin  and  Hebei \nprovinces, and a TA to strengthen water resources management, focusing on the Hai River \nbasin.5 The Government has requested further ADB assistance to control pollution in Shandong \nand Henan provinces, which are downstream of the Hai River basin.6  \n \n4.  In July 2003 SPG issued its Hai River Basin Water Pollution Control Implementation \nPlan as a working document in support of the Provincial Environmental 10th Five-Year Plan \n(2001\u20132005). The plan includes a requirement to improve solid waste management, defined in \nthe Provincial Urban Solid Waste Implementation Plan, June 2003. The TA will support these \nplans. The World Bank is financing two environmental protection projects in Shandong outside \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 15 February 2003.  \n2  Trans-century Green Project (Green Plan) was a key element in Government\u2019s Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000). \n3  China State Department. Notice 2000(36) requires wastewater treatment rates to reach at least 60% by 2005, and \n70% by 2010 for all cities with more than 500,000 people. The 2000 targets were mainly aimed to pretreat \nindustrial wastewater. The targets have largely been achieved. \n4  ADB. 1998.

Manila. \n6  Proposed Shandong Hai River basin pollution control project and Henan Hai River wastewater management \nproject, included in the PRC country program for 2004 and 2005, respectively.  ", "2   \nthe Hai River basin. The TA, which will cover four of the five northern municipal regions of \nShandong  within  the  Hai  River  basin and focuses on the smaller, secondary towns,7 will \ncomplement SPG\u2019s environmental protection efforts. While a number of wastewater treatment \nplants operate within these five municipalities, further expansion and additions are required if \nthe objectives of HRPPCP and related plans are to be met. The TA will also support SPG\u2019s \nurbanization  plans  for  secondary  cities  and  towns  in  line  with  policies  of  the  Central \nGovernment.  \n  \n5.  Water quality in the provincial tributaries to the Hai River is worse than class V and is \nthus below the national and provincial targets of class III (or in limited cases up to class V) for \nurban rivers in the Hai River basin. SPG has resolved to achieve wastewater treatment rate of \n45% for all secondary towns by 2005, and 60% by 2010, thus improving the classification of the \nHai River tributaries to class III and meeting or improving on the. Central government guidelines \nfor  urban  sewage  collection  and  treatment.8  Accordingly  sewage  collection  networks, \nwastewater treatment facilities, and solid waste management facilities have been constructed \n(or are being completed). Wastewater collection and treatment rates in secondary towns are far \nbelow 45%, and solid waste management has only started in some towns. Further coverage \nand capacities are urgently required.  \n \n6.  The  provision  of  interceptor  trunk  sewers  and  first-time  or  expanded  wastewater \ntreatment capacities are required to improve the environment in towns in Jinan, Binzhou, \nDezhou, and Liaocheng municipal regions in the Hai River basin (Map 2). Similarly, solid waste \ncollection and effective disposal facilities are needed to protect the local urban environment. A \ntotal of 13 project components across nine cities and towns have been identified as forming the \nproject, and are divided into three groups: municipal water supply and wastewater treatment, \nmunicipal solid waste management, and major industrial wastewater treatment. The proposed \nfacilities are required to serve rapidly expanding populations in the cities and towns.  \n \n7.  Six  municipal  wastewater  treatment  components  are  proposed  to  support \nenvironmentally acceptable means of disposal. The two wastewater treatment components in \nJiyang and Shanghe towns in Jinan comprise new trunk sewers, and the construction of a \n40,000 cubic meter (m3)/day capacity wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in each town. The \nfacilities will serve a population expected to increase from 160,000 to 280,000 by 2008. The \ncomponent in Binzhou is in Binzhou City, where rapid urban expansion of a 12-square-kilometer \nhi-tech administrative and residential zone is under development. A first-phase WWTP with \n40,000 m3/day capacity is needed to deal with sewage flows that would otherwise discharge \nuntreated into the Xisha River. The population of 86,500 in this area is estimated to increase to \n180,000 by 2008. The remaining three wastewater treatment components are in Liaocheng. The \nprovision of trunk sewers and WWTPs with capacities of 40,000, 50,000, and 100,000 m3/day \nare  required  for  the  urban  towns  of  Gaotang,  Liaocheng,  and  Linqing,  respectively.  The \npopulation served in this region is expected to increase from 105,000 to 700,000 by 2008. \nTertiary treatment is proposed for about 145,000 m3/day of effluent to enable water recycling to \nindustry, agriculture, and amenity support. One water supply component is proposed in Jiyang \ntown to provide a replacement source facility providing 39,000 m3/day of potable quality water.9 \n \n8.  Four municipal solid waste management components are proposed. Two will be in \nBinzhou, each with a capacity of 500 tons (t)/day. The facilities will include bulk waste transport \n                                                 \n7  Towns have populations of 80,000\u2013300,000 and are thus not subject to China State Notice 2000(36) (footnote 3). \n8  Towns of less than 500,000 people are not subject to wastewater treatment targets and timeframe in China State \nNotice 2000(36) (footnote 3). \n9  Development  of  new  borehole  abstraction  well-fields  and  closure  of  inadequate  water  sources  to  ensure \nsustainable potable water supply to Jiyang town.  ", "      3 \nequipment, on-site composting, and sanitary landfill. A population projected of about 835,000 by \n2015  will  be  served.  Linyi  town  in  Dezhou  will  be  provided  with  first-time  solid  waste \nmanagement capacity comprising collection and transportation facilities, 260 t/day composting \nand sanitary landfill, and institutional support. Linqing town in  Liaocheng plans to build transfer \nstations and a 400 t/day waste treatment facility to serve about 250,000 people. \n \n9.  Two large paper-making industries operate in Changyuan town in Dezhou, and Gaotang \ntown in Liaocheng, immensely influencing the economy and well-being of the communities and \ngenerating major point sources of pollution.10 Proposals are for an additional 40,000 m3/day \nWWTP at Changyuan, and 13,400 m3/day WWTP at Gaotang to treat effluents from the two \npaper mills. The direct benefits of including these two components include the following: (i) up to \n624 t/day of chemical pollutants will be removed from effluents before discharge into the Majai \nRiver; (ii) 3,100 t/day of raw materials11 will be purchased from thousands of farmers within the \nregion, thereby funneling CNY600 million into its economy; (iii) recycling of 17,000 m3/day of \ntreated wastewater will be available for agricultural irrigation, enabling a further 2,400 hectares \nof  agricultural  output  within  the  water-short  area;  and  (iv)  1,600  people  will  be  directly \nemployed.12  \n \n10.  Pre-feasibility studies have been prepared for each proposed project component. These \ndescribe the proposed wastewater and solid waste treatment and disposal processes to attain \nthe requisite effluent standards or disposal volume of solid waste, populations to be served, \ncapital expenditure, and operation and maintenance costs attributable to each component and a \nproposed tariff structure that will provide for full cost recovery and project sustainability. The \ntariff  levels  for  water,  wastewater,  and  solid  waste  have  been  reviewed  against  average \nhousehold incomes, municipal poverty lines, and number of people falling below these lines, \nand are expected to be affordable.  \n \n11.  The conceptual project framework is in Appendix 1. An initial assessment of the social \nand poverty impacts of the project is in Appendix 2.  Impacts on poverty will be through \nenvironmental improvement, health benefits, and job creation. Each component has no or minor \nresettlement issues.  \n \n12.  Environmental improvement and environmental and natural resource management are \namong ADB\u2019s strategic objectives in the PRC. ADB\u2019s strategy for the environment and water \nand wastewater sectors as reflected in the ADB Water Policy:  Water for All  is focused on \nstrengthening the legal and regulatory framework for sustainable environmental management, \nsupporting  integrated  water  and  wastewater  management,  promoting  tariff  reform,  and \nencouraging the use of cleaner technologies. ADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategy for the PRC \nenvisages a range of measures, including improvement of urban living conditions by providing \nsafe  drinking  water  and  environmental  protection  and  by  promoting  employment  and \nsustainable growth. Policy dialogue on these issues will continue with the proposed project to \nenhance  ADB\u2019s  effort  in  the  sector  and  strengthen  the  provincial  and  local  governments\u2019 \ncapacities  to  effect  environmental  protection  measures,  urban  development  targets,  and \nintegrated environmental management.  \n \n                                                 \n10Treatment does not consistently comply with provincial effluent discharge standards and could result in closing \ndown of the industries. To date, 23 paper mills have been closed down in Shandong due to noncompliance with \nwastewater discharge standards. \n11 Straw, reeds, rushes, and other agricultural products. \n12 The Shandong Quanlin Paper Industrial Company Limited in Gaotang employs over 11,000 people, about 30% of \nthe town\u2019s working population. ", "4   \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n13.  The objective of the project preparatory TA is to help SPG prepare a project suitable for \nADB  financing  by  assessing  the  technical,  environmental,  financial,  economic,  social,  and \ninstitutional feasibility of a proposed investment project comprising water supply, wastewater \ntreatment, and solid waste management to control pollution within the expanding secondary \ntowns of the Hai River basin, and to improve water quality in urban streams from class V to \nclasses  III\u2013V.  The  TA  will  also  identify  institutional  capacity-building measures, including \nintegrated wastewater management, solid waste management, and policy reforms to ensure the \nsustainability of the project and related facilities. The TA output will be workshops and a series \nof reports recommending ways to control pollution and improve the environment improvement in \nthe least-cost, most sustainable way, to further the government\u2019s environmental protection and \nurban development plans and help improve living conditions, particularly of the urban poor. \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will, separately for each project  component, (i) forecast water demand and \ndetermine the potential for water conservation management practices; (ii) assess the present \nwastewater and solid waste generation in the urban drainage areas and predict future trends; \n(iii) review and evaluate the technical options proposed by the pre-feasibility studies and confirm \nthat the project components are based on the least-cost option; (iv) provide cost estimates and \nprocurement arrangements and prepare a contract packaging plan; (v) carry out the economic \nand  financial  analyses;  (vi)  prepare  environmental  impact  assessments;  (vii)  review \ngovernment\u2019s land acquisition and resettlement plans, provide summaries of each, and prepare \na resettlement framework; (viii) analyze financial governance and financial performance of the \nexecuting agency and implementing agencies; (ix) recommend enterprise and sector reforms; \n(x) evaluate the poverty impact of the project and identify ways to make it more pro-poor; and \n(xi) establish monitoring indicators and a monitoring mechanism. Consultants will undertake a \npoverty and social survey analysis and social impact assessment. \n \n15.  The  major  assumptions  and  risks  that  need  to  be  considered  for  successful  TA \nimplementation include (i) adequate counterpart support and performance; (ii) timely provision \nof  necessary  technical,  social,  economic,  financial,  and  environmental  data;  (iii)  timely \nsubmission of required studies; (iv) timely appointment and mobilization of consultants; and (v) \nadequate performance by consultants. Competent consultants will be recruited on time, and \nregular performance checks carried out. SPG agreed to provide adequate counterpart support \nand  all  necessary  data  and  to  undertake  and  update  all  required  studies  according  to  a \ntimetable  agreed  on  with  ADB.  Close  coordination  among  the  consultants,  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, and ADB will further mitigate the risks. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.   The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $750,000 equivalent, of which $440,000 is \nthe foreign exchange cost and $310,000 equivalent the local currency cost. The Government \nhas requested ADB to finance $600,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost, \nand $160,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government of the PRC has agreed to provide the balance of \nthe local currency cost, equivalent to $150,000 for counterpart staff, office space, furniture, \nadministrative  support  and  interpretation  services,  logistics,  and  local  transportation.  The ", "      5 \nGovernment has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to financing any \nensuing project. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  SPG will be the executing agency for the TA. The vice governor of Shandong will chair \nthe project leading group for the TA and ensuing project. The group members will be from the \nShandong Provincial Planning Committee, Shandong Provincial Construction Bureau (SPCB), \nShandong Provincial Finance Bureau, Shandong Environmental Protection Bureau, and each \nproject city or town to ensure that their views are adequately considered and necessary support \nprovided. A senior official of SPCB will be the director for the TA and project management office \n(PMO). A full-time qualified and experienced senior staff member of SPCB will be appointed as \nPMO deputy director to oversee TA implementation. Two qualified and experienced full-time \ncounterpart staff will help the consultants. To facilitate  TA implementation, SPG will provide \nsupport  to  the  consultants,  including  a  suitably  furnished  office  with  utilities  and \ntelecommunication access, materials, maps, data, and other documents. \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented over 5 months, from March to August 2004. Total input of \nthe  consultants  is  estimated  at  42  person-months,  consisting  of  16  person-months  of \ninternational  and  26  person-months  of  domestic  consultant  services.  The  consultants  will \nprovide expertise in wastewater and solid waste engineering and management, water supply \ntechnology, environmental assessment, economic and financial analyses, social development, \nresettlement  issues,  and  institutional  development.  The  consultants  will  be  engaged  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants based on the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the selection and \nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  consultants\u2019  outline  terms  of  reference  are  in \nAppendix 4. As they define in detail consultants\u2019 tasks and the methodology to be used, ADB\u2019s \nsimplified technical proposal approach will be used to select and engage the consultants.  \n \n19.  The consultants will submit to ADB inception, interim, draft final, and final reports, as well \nas  summary  and  full  environmental  impact  assessment,  social  impact  assessment,  and \nresettlement reports. The executive summary of the interim report and the complete draft final \nand final reports will be translated into Chinese. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has  approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for preparing the Shandong Hai River Basin \nPollution Control Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nCONCEPTUAL PROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Project Targets and  Monitoring  Risks and \nMeasurable Indicators  Mechanism  Assumptions \nSector/Area Goals       \nImprove environmental  Restore river water  Surveys conducted  Institutional monitoring \nand social conditions in  quality classification to  at midterm and at  and sanctioning \nsecondary cities and  classes III\u2013V as  project completion  capacities are adequate. \ntowns in the Hai River  specified in the State Hai  as part of project   \nbasin to support planned  River Pollution  performance  Project outputs are \nurban development  Prevention and Control  monitoring system  sustainable. \n  Plan     \n    Implementation   \n  Provide safe drinking  reporting   \n  water to all    \n    River water quality \n  Increase the ratio of  monitoring \n  wastewater treatment to   \n60% by 2010  Government \n  statistics \nProvide safe disposal of \n100% solid waste \n \nPurpose/Objectives       \n  Improve potable water  Implementing  Infrastructure is \nReplace exhausted  availability to about  agencies\u2019  properly managed, \npotable water source  250,000 people  management  operated, and \n    information system  maintained. \nCollect and treat  By 2008 provide solid     \nwastewater and solid  waste collection and  Surveys at midterm  Community \nwaste to improve the  sustainable disposal to  and project  participation in project \nurban environment and  about 1.35 million  completion  design and \ncontrol pollution of rivers in  people in four cities and     implementation is \nsecondary towns  towns   Project performance  effective. \n    reporting   \nProvide recycled water for  By 2008 provide a piped    Maintenance of the \nirrigation and public  sewerage system and  Quarterly progress  infrastructure facilities is \namenity use  full wastewater  reports  sustainable. \n  treatment to about 1.5     \n  million people in six  Reduction in fines  Project implementation \n  cities and towns   and compensation  is effective. \n    paid for pollution of   \nBy 2008 improve effluent  rivers  Tariff strategy is \nstandards from    effective, and \nwastewater treatment  communities are willing \nplants (WWTPs) to  to pay.  \nreduce xx tons (t)/day of   \npollutant load to rivers    \n   \nProvide tertiary   \ntreatment at WWTPs for   \nrecycled water   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n \n ", "  Appendix 1  7   \nDesign Summary  Project Targets and  Monitoring  Risks and \nMeasurable Indicators  Mechanism  Assumptions \nComponents/Outputsa       \n       \nWater supply   Develop new bulk water  Survey of  Sufficient connections \n  resource of 39,000 cubic  consumers  are installed to intercept \n  meters (m3)/day in    wastewater flows. \n  Jiyang town in Jinan  Monitoring of effluent   \n    and river water  Pumping stations are \nWastewater treatment and  Construct or expand  quality  operated correctly. \npollution control   eight wastewater     \n  treatment plants in the  Volume and rate of  Foul sewage is treated \n  cities and surrounding  delivery  in a separate system, \n  towns in Binzhou,    and WWTPs are \n  Liaocheng, Jinan, and  Volumes treated and  operated effectively. \n  Dezhou municipal  social survey   \n  regions     Wastewater and solid \n    Completion of  waste tariffs are fully \n  Provide 145,000 m3  proposed works and  applied as planned. \nRecycling of water for non- treated water distribution  river class achieved   \npotable uses  for secondary uses  Management and \n    enforcement of industrial \n  Provide bulk waste  effluent discharge \nSolid waste management   transport and construct  regulations are \n  four solid waste  improved. \n  treatment facilities with a   \n  combined capacity of  Solid waste collection \n1660 t/day in 4 cities and  and transport is properly \nsurrounding towns in  managed. \nBinzhou, Dezhou, and   \nLiaocheng municipal  Solid waste disposal \nregions  facilities are operated \n  effectively. \n \nActivitiesb  Inputsb     \n \na To be confirmed during technical assistance (TA) implementation.  \nb To be developed during TA implementation. \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS \n \n \nA.
