INTRODUCTION \n1.  Commitments under the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness require development \nagencies to align their assistance programs with partner countries' national development plans \nand priorities to achieve greater aid effectiveness.1 The commitments also call for supporting \nthe development of partner countries\u2019 capacity to plan, implement, and account for the results of \ndevelopment  policies  and  programs.  As  a  signatory  to  the  Paris  Declaration,  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has undertaken a number of initiatives to transform its relationships \nwith developing member countries (DMCs) and reorient the business process to ensure that its \nassistance  strategies  and  operations  are  aligned  with  DMCs\u2019  own  development  plans  and \npoverty-reduction strategies. One such step was the ADB-financed technical assistance (TA) for \nStrengthening Country Diagnosis and Analysis of Binding Development Constraints in Selected \nDMCs, approved in 2007.2 The present TA, Diagnosing Critical Constraints to Growth and \nStructural Transformation in Selected Developing Member Countries, builds on the work of the \n2007 TA in terms of depth and breadth of the scope of analytical work and covers a new set of \nDMCs. A concept paper prepared for the TA was approved by the vice-president (knowledge \nmanagement  and  sustainable  development)  in  October  2010.3 The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The last 25 years have seen considerable evolution in thinking on development policies. \nThe Washington Consensus4 was guided by the belief that there was a short list of policy \nreforms that would promote growth. The list formed a natural reform agenda for developing \ncountries seeking assistance from multilateral and bilateral funding agencies in the late 1980s. \nSubsequent experience showed, however, that the expectations raised by this agenda were \noften misplaced. Economic growth fell far short of expectations in Africa, Eastern Europe, and \nLatin  America  but  exceeded  expectations  in  some  Asian  countries  that  departed from  the \naccepted rules of good practices.  \n \n3.  Disappointment with the Washington Consensus led to broadening the development \nagenda in the late 1990s, with emphasis shifting to the so-called second-generation reforms \nlargely revolving around governance and institutions. There are, however, concerns among \nmany  that  this  approach  may  create  an  impossibly  broad  and  ambitious  agenda  that \ninsufficiently differentiates the needs of particular countries. Moreover, frequent growth episodes \nobserved in countries with limited or piecemeal changes in institutional endowments and sharp \ndisparities in regional development within economies suggest problems with overemphasizing \nbroad institutional reform as the precursor to growth. Economists continued to search for new \napproaches to development strategy. \n \n4.  This search led to the Barcelona Consensus of 2004,5 which recommended that, since \nno single set of policies could guarantee growth, the priority for developing countries searching \nfor an effective development strategy should be to identify the most binding constraints to \n                                                \n1  Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. 2005. http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/11/41/34428351.pdf \n2  ADB. 2007. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Country Diagnosis and Analysis of Binding Development \nConstraints in Selected Developing Member Countries. Manila (TA 6397-REG). \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 26 October 2010. \n4  The concept and name of the Washington Consensus were first presented in 1989 by John Williamson. He used \nthe term to refer to a set of 10 recommendations that synthesized policy advice by the International Monetary Fund, \nWorld Bank, United States Treasury Department, and Washington-based think tanks for the recovery of Latin \nAmerica from the financial crises of the 1980s and cycles of high inflation and low growth. \n5  Sixteen leading economists gathered in Barcelona in September 2004 to discuss the effects of economic reforms, \nlessons for future policy making, and the performance of international economic systems, issuing a consensus on \ngrowth and development. http://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/ipd/pub/BarcelonaPreliminaryMeetingSummary.pdf  \n ", "2   \ngrowth and remove them through appropriate micro- and macroeconomic policies. Prioritizing \nthe constraints and targeting the most binding ones promised the highest growth, as their \nremoval would have the largest impact. As part of the search for new development strategies, \nseveral Harvard economists pioneered the growth diagnostic framework,6 which is a systematic \nmethodology for undertaking country diagnosis and identifying binding constraints to growth. \nThe framework has been widely adopted by multilateral and bilateral development partners, \nincluding the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, Inter-American \nDevelopment Bank, and World Bank. \n \n5.  In  light  of  the  Paris  Declaration\u2019s  call  for  supporting  the  development  of  partner \ncountries\u2019 capacity to plan, implement, and account for the results of development policies and \nprograms, and recognizing the usefulness of the approach, ADB approved TA in May 2007 to \nintroduce  the  growth  diagnostic  framework  in  selected  DMCs  (footnote  2).  The  TA  also \ndeveloped and introduced the framework for diagnosing constraints to poverty reduction and \ninequality.7 \n \n6.  Due for completion in December 2010, the TA has been largely successful in achieving \nits objectives. Studies have been completed for Indonesia, Nepal, and the Philippines while the \nstudy on Papua New Guinea is due for completion in 2010. Findings of the completed studies \nhave  been  published.8 In  addition,  the  TA  produced  the  book  Diagnosing  the  Philippine \nEconomy: Toward Inclusive Growth.9 Study reports have been widely  appreciated by both \nexternal clients (governments and other stakeholders in DMCs and development partners) and \nADB\u2019s regional departments. The report for the Philippines was a key input into the midterm \nreview of the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan, 2004\u20132010 and the formulation of the \nupcoming  Medium-Term  Philippine  Development  Plan,  2010\u20132016.  Similarly,  the  report for \nNepal is a key input into the ongoing formulation of the next 5-year plan for Nepal, and interim \ndrafts  of  the  report  for  Indonesia  informed  the  preparation  of  National  Medium-Term \nDevelopment  Plan,  2010\u20132014.  In  addition,  DMC  governments  have  found  the  reports \nbeneficial in engaging other development partners and expanding development dialogues with \nthem. In particular, the governments of Indonesia and the Philippines have used the reports on \ntheir respective countries as the bases for dialogue with the Millennium Challenge Corporation \nof the United States government toward seeking grant assistance. ADB regional departments \nfound the reports useful in formulating and/or updating country partnership strategies (CPSs) for \nthe  selected  countries.  The  Nepal  CPS,  2010\u20132012  drew  on  the  study\u2019s  findings  and \nrecommendations to focus the strategy on the critical constraints identified by the study.10 \nSimilarly, the draft Philippines CPS, due for endorsement in 2011, has benefited from the study \non the Philippines and targets the critical development constraints. The TA has also been \nsuccessful in terms of creating awareness and appreciation of the diagnostic approaches to \nplanning in the selected DMCs and ADB\u2019s regional departments.  \n \n7.  Awareness of the approach and the success of the studies under the 2007 TA have \ngenerated further demand for country diagnostic studies. In some cases, regional departments \nhave initiated diagnostic studies to support the preparation of the upcoming CPS. Replication is, \nhowever, rather concentrated in terms of regional spread and relatively small in scale. While \nreplication in larger DMCs with sufficient analytical and planning capacity would be a matter of \n                                                \n6  Hausmann, R., D. Rodrick, and A.

Efforts are also needed to ensure \nimprovements in the quality of replication in terms of both depth and breadth. The TA has \nrevealed that structural transformation is a growing issue in many DMCs. Achieving rapid, \nsustained economic growth depends not just the rate but also on the pattern of growth, so a \ncountry needs to continuously transform its economic structure by diversifying production and \nupgrading  to  higher  value  addition.  This  requires  careful  diagnosis  of  constraints  that  are \nspecific to structural transformation.  \n \n8.  The present TA will build on and expand the work undertaken by the 2007 TA, benefiting \nfrom  its  lessons. In  addition  to  supporting  diagnostic studies for  a  new  set  of DMCs,  the \nfollowing considerations have guided the design of the TA: (i) Process is important in conducting \na diagnostic study, which needs to include ample opportunities for stakeholders to participate. (ii) \nIn addition to constraints to growth, diagnosis needs to identify constraints to DMCs\u2019 structural \ntransformation and regional integration. (iii) In small and landlocked economies, the constraints \nneed to be identified and overcome by region rather than nationally. (iv) In addition to economy-\nwide diagnosis, constraints need to be understood and overcome in the priority sectors in an \neconomy.  (v)  The  dissemination  of  diagnostic  approaches  needs  to  be  strengthened, \nparticularly in countries not selected for diagnostic studies. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will help enhance the development impact of DMCs\u2019 medium-term plans and \npoverty-reduction  strategies.11 The  outcome  will  be  the  use  of  diagnostic  approaches  in \nassessments and analytical work underlying national development plans. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  TA  will  have  two  main  components:  (i)  the  conduct  of  diagnostic  studies  and \n(ii) dissemination workshops. \n \n11.  Diagnostic  studies.  The TA will conduct two or three country studies to diagnose \ncritical constraints to rapid and inclusive economic growth and to structural transformation in \nselected DMCs, utilizing various diagnostic tools that include (i) a growth diagnostic framework, \n(ii)  a  diagnostic  framework  for  reducing  poverty  and  inequality,  and  (iii)  product  space \nanalysis.12 The TA will also undertake one or two studies to diagnose critical constraints in a \nspecific sector at the regional level or constraints to regional integration. In addition, the TA will \nsupport in-country diagnoses of constraints to priority sectors in selected DMCs. \n \n12.  The country diagnostic studies will be undertaken over 9\u201312 months. The DMCs will be \nselected in consultation with DMC governments and ADB regional departments. The general \ncriteria for selecting DMCs will be as follows: (i) the government should show keen interest in \nthe  study;  (ii)  the  study  should  be  timed  such  that  it  will  inform  the  formulation  and/or \nimplementation of the DMC\u2019s medium-term development plan; (iii) the study should generate \n                                                \n11 The TA will include studies for a number of DMCs, including Cambodia, Maldives, Nepal, and Viet Nam. ADB has \nobtained a letter of no objection from Maldives and Nepal, and will seek to obtain it from other selected DMCs \nduring the course of the implementation of the TA. \n12 The product space analysis, pioneered by Hausmann and Klinger (2006), is a methodology to study structural \ntransformation in an economy using disaggregated export data. See Hausmann, R. and B. Klinger. 2006. Structural \nTransformation and Patrons of Comparative Advantage in the Product Space. CID Working Paper. No. 128. Center \nfor International Development at Harvard University. \n ", "4   \ndemonstration effects; and (iv) DMCs with relatively weak analytical and planning capacity are \npreferred. \n \n13.  The studies will be conducted in five steps: (i) a review of development performance and \npatterns,  (ii)  the  conduct  of  an  overarching  diagnosis  of  constraints  to  high  and  inclusive \neconomic growth, (iii) the conduct of in-depth analysis in the broad areas of critical constraints \nidentified through the overarching diagnosis, (iv) the formulation of policy options to overcome \nthe critical constraints, and (v) the dissemination of findings. An interactive process with two or \nthree workshops will inform and consult with key stakeholders on study approaches, findings, \nand policy options. \n \n14.  Frameworks for diagnosing constraints in a particular sector at the regional level or \nconstraints to regional integration are not as well developed or researched as constraints to \ngrowth or on reducing poverty and inequality. Hence, the TA will distill ADB\u2019s own experience \nwith  diagnostic  approaches,  as  well  as  that  of  other  development  agencies,  to  develop  a \nmethodology  for  diagnosing  constraints  at  the  regional  level.  The  TA  will  then  pilot  the \nmethodology to draw lessons for mainstreaming it in DMCs and ADB operations. Possible \nstudies may be a diagnosis to support the preparation of one of ADB\u2019s regional cooperation \nstrategies or a study to better understand structural transformation in the manufacturing or \nservices  sector  in  a  region.  Study  topics  will  be  selected  in  consultation  with  regional \ndepartments. \n \n15.  In addition, the TA will undertake a number of sector-specific diagnoses focusing on a \nsingle country to support the development of DMCs\u2019 sector strategies. These studies, which will \nbe implemented over 2\u20133 months, will be selected in consultation with DMC governments and \nregional departments. \n \n16.  Dissemination workshops. The dissemination of the diagnostic approaches will be \nundertaken at the regional and country level. Early in implementation, the TA will organize a \nregional workshop to showcase for DMC officials and development partners ADB\u2019s experiences \nwith diagnostic approaches and to learn from the experiences of other development partners.  \n \n17.  In addition to the regional workshop, each of the diagnostic studies will be disseminated \nin that country and/or at the regional level through workshops and print and broadcast media. \nThe workshops will aim to attract all key stakeholders including representatives of government \nagencies, civil society, the private sector, academic and research institutions, and development \npartners. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost the equivalent of $1,000,000, which will be financed on a \ngrant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-IV).  Details  of  the  cost \nestimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  ADB will be, through the Economics and Research Department, the executing agency. \nThe TA will be implemented in coordination with ADB regional departments and the planning \nagencies of DMCs from January 2011 to June 2013.13 \n \n20.  The  TA  will  require  28  person-months  of  international  consultancy  and  26  person-\nmonths of national consultancy from development economists, sector specialists, editors, and \n                                                \n13 No activities under the TA will be initiated in the selected DMCs until a no objection letter is received from the \nrespective government. \n ", "  5 \nresearch assistants. As the actual requirements of each type of expertise and the length of their \ninputs will be identified only during the implementation of individual studies, it is not possible to \nstate the exact requirements for the individual studies or for the TA overall. Given this limitation, \nthe intermittent nature of assignments, and the anticipated variety of expertise required, the TA \nwill meet its consulting requirements primarily by recruiting experts individually in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). Outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n21.  ADB will procure computer hardware and software in accordance with its Procurement \nGuidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Procurement will be coordinated with ADB\u2019s \nOffice of Information Systems and Technology and Office of Administrative Services. Upon TA \ncompletion,  procured  equipment  will  be  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  the  project \nadministration  instruction  on  administering  grant-financed  technical  assistance  projects. 14 \nDisbursement  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n22.  DMCs for the individual studies will be selected in consultation with DMC governments \nand regional departments. Once an individual study commences, the study team will collaborate \nclosely with government agencies (planning and finance ministries, statistics agencies, etc.), \nresearch institutions, and universities. Each study will include a number of consultations to \nensure  the  participation  of  other  key  stakeholders,  such  as  civil  society,  private  sector \norganizations, researchers, and academics. Inputs from governments in selected DMCs will \ninclude  a  provision  of  access  to  relevant  background  materials  and  data.  In  addition, \ngovernments will be expected to designate agencies and/or staff as focal points to take charge \nof coordinating with ADB and within the government throughout TA implementation and to \nsupport the consolidation of inputs from participating DMC agencies, experts\u2019 conduct of studies, \nthe finalization of the studies, and the organization of dissemination workshops.  \n \n23.  Where  possible,  the  TA  will  explore  study  partnerships  with  development  partners. \nExperience in the 2007 TA clearly demonstrated the usefulness of such collaboration in terms of \nbuilding  and  fostering  knowledge  partnerships  and  of  building  consensus  on  development \ndirections.  The  experience  from  the  2007  TA  suggests  that  the  interests  of  development \npartners vary from country to country and it is best that collaboration be explored once a study \ntopic has been selected and its outline and coverage are clear. As with the 2007 TA, in which \nADB collaborated with the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom, \nInternational  Labour  Organization,  and  Islamic  Development  Bank,  the  TA  will  follow  an \napproach of independent but coordinated activities toward a common objective and outputs.  \n \n24.  The Economics and Research Department will report on the progress of the TA and the \nindividual studies quarterly through a TA performance report and project information document. \nThe TA will produce a number of reports on the individual studies, which will be disseminated \nthrough in-country and regional workshops. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n25.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 on a grant basis \nfor  Diagnosing  Critical  Constraints  to  Growth  and  Structural  Transformation  in  Selected \nDeveloping Member Countries, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                \n14 ADB. 2009.

The economists will \n(i)  facilitate the conduct a study inception workshop to inform and get feedback from \nkey  stakeholders,  including  governments,  the  private  sector,  civil  society,  and \ndevelopment partners; \n(ii)  facilitate the formation and functioning of peer groups, drawing membership from \nnational planning agencies, academic and research institutions, other development \npartners, and interested civil society organizations; \n(iii)  review the pattern of growth exhibited and compare it with experiences in similar \neconomies within and beyond the region; \n(iv)  dissect economic growth, taking into account production, demand, and supply, and \ncompare it with experiences in similar economies within and beyond the region; \n(v)  undertake  an  overarching  diagnostic  analysis  of  constraints  to  broad-based \neconomic growth, which will identify the topics for in-depth studies; \n(vi)  consolidate  the  findings  of  constraint-specific  studies,  identifying  the  binding \nconstraints and policy options to address them in a draft country diagnostic report; \n(vii)  facilitate  the  conduct  of  the  country  workshop  and  prepare  a  presentation \nsummarizing the findings of the country diagnostic report; and \n(viii)  finalize  the  country  diagnostic  report  by  incorporating  comments  and  feedback \nreceived at the country workshop. \n \n3.  Sector specialists (10 person-months). The specialists will undertake in-depth studies of \none or two key constraints, which may include poverty and inequality; unbalanced and narrow \ngrowth; undeveloped infrastructure, human capital and education, or finance sector; governance; \nmacroeconomic management; structural transformation and industrial policies; health; and the \npolitical economy. The specialists will \n(i)  review trends and benchmark them against other countries, regions, and times; \n(ii)  propose a diagnostic framework and finalize it in consultation with key stakeholders \nand the study team; \n(iii)  undertake a diagnostic analysis following a systematic framework to identify the \nunderlying constraints; \n(iv)  summarize the findings of the studies on the constraint and the policy options to \naddress them in a report that will become a section on the overall study report; \n(v)  coordinate regularly with other colleagues on the evolving findings and provide \nfeedback to ensure consistency and complementarity in the final output; and \n(vi)  present the findings of the report in the country workshop. \n \n ", " 10  Appendix 3 \n \n4.  Editor (4 person-months). The editor will oversee the publication of various study reports, \ncoordinating with the development economists and sector specialists to review and finalize drafts \nof overarching and in-depth studies. Under the supervision of ADB staff, the editor will \n(i)  review and edit the draft reports, ensuring that they adhere to ADB style and usage, \nconform to high publication standards, and are properly and promptly delivered; \n(ii)  oversee the laying out of the report; \n(iii)  oversee the publication of the report; and \n(iv)  assist in developing the study website. \n \nB.  National Consulting Services \n \n5.  Country economists (26 person-months). The economists will undertake or assist in-depth \nstudies of the critical constraints identified in the overarching analysis. The economists will mainly \nassist  the  development  economists  in  conducting  studies  but  will  also  be  responsible  for \nindependent tasks. In undertaking the constraint-specific studies, the economists will \n(i)  assemble  the  relevant  country  and  cross-country  data  sets  and  identify  the \nunderlying factors responsible for the critical constraint; \n(ii)  coordinate regularly with colleagues on the evolving findings and provide feedback \nto ensure consistency and complementarity in the final output; \n(iii)  identify relevant policy recommendations for addressing binding constraints; \n(iv)  assist the development economists in presenting the findings of the constraint-\nspecific studies to the peer group for review and feedback; \n(v)  assist the development economists in summarizing the findings of the constraint-\nspecific studies in a report, which will become sections of the overall country report; \nand \n(vi)  assist the development economists in presenting the findings of the reports in the \ncountry workshops. \n \n6.  Research assistants (as needed). Research assistants will assist staff members of the \nEconomics and Research Department and the study team in assembling and analyzing databases. \nThey will be expected to help manage the study website and mailing list and help prepare various \npresentations and reports.
