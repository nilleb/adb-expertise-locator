I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Rooftop Solar Power Generation Project. \nThe report also describes the proposed administration of technical assistance (TA) to be provided \nby the Asian Clean Energy Fund1 under the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility for \nImplementation  Support  to  the  Rooftop  Solar  Power  Generation  Project,  and  if  the  Board \napproves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by the Board, approve \nthe administration of the TA. \n \n2.  The  project  includes  (i)  debt  funding  for  rooftop  solar  power  generation  systems; \n(ii) development of rooftop solar market infrastructure and a bankable subproject pipeline; and  \n(iii) building capacity and increasing awareness of stakeholders in Sri Lanka.2  \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Development priority in renewable energy. Sri Lanka\u2019s energy sector has achieved \nsteady progress in 1990\u20132016. The national electrification rate has increased from 29.0% in 1990 \nto 99.3% in 2016.3 However, thermal power generation accounts for 67.2% compared with 24.6% \nof hydro power and about 8.2% of nonconventional renewable energy generation in the total \ngeneration mix.4 This creates a high expenditure on fuel imports, undermining the balance of \npayments position, and affects the environment and Sri Lanka\u2019s commitments to the global \nclimate agenda. A key government development priority is to diversify the existing energy \ngeneration mix to include more indigenous, renewable energy resources.5 Sri Lanka\u2019s nationally \ndetermined contributions target reducing greenhouse gas emissions against the business-as-\nusual scenario (base year 2013) by 20% (4% unconditional and 16% conditional) in the energy \nsector through renewable energy development and energy efficiency improvement.6  \n \n4.  Rooftop solar photovoltaic market. Sri Lanka has substantial solar energy potential. \nSituated close to the equator, it has abundant sunlight year round. For over two-thirds of the land \nmass, solar radiation is in the range of 4.0\u20134.5 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per square meter per day, \nwhich is considered high.7 However, the development of a solar power generation market has \nbeen limited in the past. Buruthakanda Solar Park is the only utility-scale solar park, and has a \ngeneration capacity of about 1.2 megawatts (MW) that is operational. The other existing solar \npower generation facilities are rooftop based. As of November 2016, there were 4,200 customers \nwith net-metered renewable energy facilities, adding up to a cumulative generating capacity of \nabout 30 MW.8 Almost all of these facilities are solar photovoltaic installations on rooftops, except \n                                                \n1  Established by the Government of Japan. \n2  This lending proposal is included in the 2017 program of ADB. 2017.

Solar Potential. http://www.energy.gov.lk/renewables/renewable-energy-\nresources/solar/solar-potential. \n8  The current estimate of the rooftop solar photovoltaic cumulative generating capacity is about 80 MW.  \n ", "2 \nfor a few small hydro electric facilities.9 About 95% of net-metered customers are households, \nwhile the others are institutional customers. In September 2016, the government announced the \nBattle  for  Solar  Energy  program.10 The  government\u2019s  strategic  goal  is  to  increase  solar \nphotovoltaic capacity to 200 MW by 2020 and 1,000 MW by 2025. The program envisages \nboosting clean power generation through net metering, net accounting, and micro solar power \nproducer (net plus) schemes to connect rooftop photovoltaic installations to the network. These \ndifferent models are described as follows: \n \n(i)  Net metering. Introduced in 2008, this model allows customers to offset the \nconsumed electricity with the electricity they generate from their rooftop solar \nphotovoltaic systems that is advantageous for residential customers with high \nconsumption. At the end of monthly billing cycles, if the customers consume more \nthan they have generated from their rooftop solar systems, they are billed at the \nelectricity tariff rates based on their  net consumption level. If the customers \ngenerate more electricity than they consume, the electricity surplus balance is \ncarried over to the next month. The surplus balances can be kept for up to 10 years \nand distribution utilities will not pay customers for any generated surplus electricity; \n(ii)  Net accounting. Introduced in 2016, this model allows customers to be paid in \ncash for any surplus they generate at the end of their monthly billing cycles at the \nfollowing rates: (a) year 1 to year 7 at SLRs22.0/kWh, and (b) year 8 to year 20 at \nSLRs15.5/kWh. The advantage to a customer depends on its consumption level; \n(iii)  Net plus. Unlike the other two models, this allows customers to separate electricity \nconsumption and electricity generation. The customers pay for the electricity they \nconsume based on the existing tariff structure. At the same time, the customers \ncan also sell whatever electricity they generate from their rooftop solar photovoltaic \nsystems  at  the following rates: (a)  year  1 to year  7  at  SLRs22.0/kWh,  and                \n(b) year 8 to year 20 at SLRs15.5/kWh. This scheme may be advantageous for \ncommercial customers with big roof spaces. The scheme was introduced in 2016.  \n \n5.  Demand analysis. The project is built upon a strong government commitment to create a \nconducive business environment to enable rooftop solar system financing, including development \nof dedicated financing schemes, introduction of bankable business models, and duty and tax \nexemptions on solar panels and invertors. Under the net metering scheme, the rooftop solar \npower generation capacity increased from 0.7 MW to 60.0 MW from 2012 to 2016. With the \nintroduction of the net accounting and net plus models in 2016, the rooftop solar market is poised \nfor further expansion. Based on the financial viability of the three rooftop solar financing models, \nthe market has a strong potential to absorb Asian Development Bank (ADB) funds over the           \n4\u2013year implementation period.11 A preliminary indicative subproject pipeline from the PFIs points \nto a demand for approximately $20 million. A list of the subprojects is provided in a detailed \ndemand analysis, which also ascertains the sufficient market size under the available financing \nmodels based on current tariff structure at various lending rates.12 Market infrastructure is sound. \nFrom the suppliers\u2019 side, there are about 200 private sector renewable energy service companies \nwith a track record to provide rooftop solar systems installation and maintenance. \n \n6.  Banking sector. In 2013\u20132017, the banking sector maintained sound capital adequacy, \n                                                \n9  No net metered wind or other forms of renewable-energy-based power generating facilities have been reported. \n10 Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy. 2016.

However, market liquidity is tightening and interest rates are high. \nAverage weighted deposit rates rose from 5.9% in January 2015 to 9.2% in July 2017.13 \nCombined with perceived higher commercial risk in the nascent rooftop solar industry with \nuntested business models (e.g., net accounting and net plus), bank lending is limited. Thus, it is \nessential  for  the  banks  to  provide  the  funds  at  viable  terms  and  conditions  to  facilitate \ndevelopment while not distorting the market. A detailed analysis of the banking sector is in the \nfinancial analysis (footnote 11). ADB identified 10 potential participating financial institutions \n(PFIs) based on upfront financial soundness criteria, relevant institutional experience, and/or \npotential subproject pipeline.  \n \n7.  Project. The project will provide long-term debt financing for the installation of rooftop \nsolar photovoltaic power generation systems. The loan will be provided through the Ministry of \nFinance and Mass Media (MOFMM) to PFIs, including public and private sector banks, for \nfinancing qualified rooftop solar systems based on the available business models. TA associated \nwith the project (see para. 23) will support (i) establishing technical guidelines and standards for \nrooftop solar systems; (ii) subproject screening, implementation, monitoring, and compliance \nactivities; and (iii) stakeholder capacity and market development.  \n \n8.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Sri Lanka that \nprioritizes assistance to renewable energy development.14 It builds on previous ADB interventions \nfocused on supporting transmission and distribution investments to expand access to clean and \nreliable electricity.15 The project considers lessons relating to grid integration of renewable energy \nand from a similar rooftop solar financial intermediation loan, reflecting improved implementation \narrangements and project design.16 Being a financial intermediation loan, the project will not \ncrowd out similar private sector commercial finance because substantial government support and \nsubsidy (e.g., feed-in tariff and system of import duty exemption) are still required to quickly \nexpand the rooftop solar system finance and installations.17 \n                                                \n13 Central Bank of Sri Lanka.

Germany, India, Japan, \nand People\u2019s Republic of China used significant government subsidies to develop rooftop solar generation. The \n \n ", "4 \n9.  Value added by ADB assistance. The project will enable ADB to help the government \nestablish a lending facility to support rooftop solar financing. ADB has extensive technical and \nfinancial expertise in renewable energy development in South Asia, including from a $500 million \nproject in India to support a similar rooftop solar financing in 2016 (footnote 16). ADB\u2019s knowledge \nand experience will bring international best practices to the PFIs and help Sri Lanka develop \ninnovative renewable energy solutions. This will contribute to the government\u2019s program of \nincreasing clean power generation from solar energy, particularly the rooftop solar targets of 200 \nMW by 2020 and 1,000 MW by 2025. The project will help mainstream renewable energy \ndevelopment, increase the generation capacity for clean power, and improve the environmental \nconditions in the country. 18 It will increase the clean power generation capacity by 50 MW, which \nwill result in about 72,300 megawatt-hours of energy generation per year, equivalent to avoiding \nabout 55,600 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year.  \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The project is aligned with the following impact: access to clean and reliable power supply \nin Sri Lanka increased by 2025 (footnote 5). The project will have the following outcome: clean \npower generation enhanced.19 \n \nC.  Outputs \n \n11.  Output 1: Debt funding for rooftop solar power generation increased. This includes \nfinancing of rooftop solar subprojects equivalent to additional capacity of 50 MW.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Rooftop solar market infrastructure and bankable subproject pipeline \ndeveloped. This includes (i) selection of PFIs for handling debt funding of commercial and \ndomestic sector rooftop solar systems; (ii) development of a pipeline of bankable subprojects for \ntotal capacity of 50 MW; and (iii) establishment of project technical guidelines and standards to \nbe followed by borrowers, vendors, and accredited engineers.  \n \n13.  Output  3:  Capacity  and  awareness  of  stakeholders,  including  the  Ministry  of \nFinance and Mass Media, participating financial institutions, and commercial and domestic \nsector customers increased. This includes (i) capacity training and workshops for the MOFMM, \nPFIs, and developers to improve knowledge on rooftop solar systems; (ii) awareness campaigns \nfor stakeholders and potential customers; and (iii) establishing and maintaining a comprehensive \ndatabase of all installations.  \n \nD.  Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n \n14.  The government has requested a regular loan of $50 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources to help finance the project. The loan will have a 30-year term, including a grace period \nof 7 years; an annual interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered \nrate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other \nterms and conditions set forth in the draft loan agreement.20 Based on the straight-line repayment \n                                                \nsame holds true for Sri Lanka. ADB's Clean Energy and Network Efficiency Improvement Project in Sri Lanka that \nwas approved in 2012 had 50% grant financing to pilot 1 MW rooftop solar photovoltaic project component. \n18 ADB. 2016. Technical Assistance to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the Solar Rooftop Power \nGeneration Project. Manila (TA 9278-SRI).  \n19 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n20 The longer loan terms would allow the use of the credit line as a revolving fund, at the government\u2019s discretion. \n \n ", "5 \nmethod, the average maturity is 18.75 years, and the maturity premium payable to ADB is 0.20% \nper year. \n \n15.  The summary financing plan is in Table 1. ADB will finance the eligible expenditures, \nincluding taxes and duties, leading to installation of qualified rooftop solar photovoltaic systems.21 \nIn cases of commercial-scale systems, an appropriate amount of equity of about 20% may be \nrequired, and additional debt may be leveraged by the PFIs, based on commercial and risk \nmanagement principles.  \n \nTable 1: Summary Financing Plan \n  Amount  Share of Total \nSource  ($ million)  (%) \nAsian Development Bank      \nOrdinary capital resources (regular loan)  50.0  83.6 \nSubproject equity contributiona   9.8  16.4 \nTotal  59.8  100.0 \na  For commercial rooftop solar systems, an equity contribution of about 20% of the total subproject costs may be \nrequired by participating financial institutions, assuming 40% of the Asian Development Bank loan or $20 million is \nused  for  commercial  rooftop  solar  system  financing.  The  government  will  cover  financing  charges  during \nimplementation. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n16.  Climate mitigation is estimated to cost $50 million, and ADB will finance 100% of mitigation \ncosts.  \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 2 and described in detail in \nthe project administration manual (PAM).22 \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nImplementation period  1 January 2018\u201331 December 2021 \nEstimated completion date  31 December 2021 \nEstimated loan closing date  30 June 2022 \nManagement \n(i)   Oversight body  Steering committee chaired by secretary or deputy secretary, MOFMM \nand including representatives of MOFMM, MNPEA, MPRE, SLSEA, \nCEB, LECO, PUCSL, and key PFIs \n(ii)  Executing agency  MOFMM  \n(iii)  Key implementing  DFD of MOFMMa \nagencies \n(iv)  Implementation unit  Project management unit established in DFD \nProcurement  In accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended \nfrom time to time) as applicable to financial intermediation loans. \nConsulting services  No consulting services envisaged. \n                                                \n21  The amount of taxes and duties (i) is within the reasonable threshold identified during the country partnership strategy \npreparation process, (ii) does not represent an excessive share of the project investment plan, and (iii) will only be \nfinanced in respect to ADB-financed expenditures.

Manila). \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n18.  The MOFMM will convert the ADB United States dollar funds at market exchange rates \nand provide the equivalent amount in Sri Lanka rupees to PFIs under subsidiary loan agreements. \nThe government will be responsible for foreign exchange risk. The subsidiary loans\u2019 terms and \nconditions to PFIs, subject to ADB concurrence, will be based on the government\u2019s cost of ADB \nfunds and reflect the commercial market conditions to develop the rooftop solar photovoltaic \nsystems in Sri Lanka. ADB and the MOFMM will ensure that the selected PFIs meet ADB\u2019s \nrequirements  for  integrity  and  anti-money-laundering  assessment,  and  sound  financial \nmanagement and implementation capacity. The debt funding (through a credit line) to finance \nrooftop solar facilities could be used on a revolving basis, at the government\u2019s discretion, following \nthe ADB loan closure, but maintaining the same project compliance requirements.  \n \n19.  The MOFMM will establish a project management unit in the Development Finance \nDepartment that will include experienced staff and will be headed by a senior officer to administer \nthe credit line. The Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority will establish a suitable project \nimplementation unit, staffed with consultants funded under the ADB TA, to handle technical and \nimplementation matters (see para. 23). The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity \nCompany Limited (LECO), the only two utilities in Sri Lanka, will support project implementation \nby  providing  technical  recommendations  to  the  PFIs  regarding  technical  proposals  of  the \napplicants, including review and approval of applications for connection of rooftop solar systems \nto the distribution network and confirming quality of generated power.  \n \n20.  Maximum ADB financing. ADB does not impose any maximum subproject or subloan \nlimits but any rooftop solar subloan application from a PFI for the financing of a subproject with a \npower generation capacity above 1 MW will be brought for consideration of the steering committee \nestablished under the project. ADB funds can be used to finance up to 100% of the total subproject \ncost for residential rooftop solar subprojects.23 For commercial-scale rooftop solar systems with a \ntotal subproject cost of $50,000 and more, an appropriate equity contribution from the sponsor is \nrequired, to be set at a level that is commensurate with the risks of the particular subproject. The \nADB loan will be disbursed consistent with the expenditure limits stated in the subsidiary loan \nagreements with the PFIs. \n \n                                                \n23 The nature of the residential rooftop solar system financing is similar to those of a consumer loan, with a total cost \nless than the equivalent of $10,000. Therefore, equity contribution is generally not required, but this is at PFIs\u2019 own \ndiscretion.  \n ", "7 \n21.  Free limit. ADB will review at least the first three subprojects submitted by each PFI, \nregardless of the subproject size, or until ADB is satisfied with that PFI\u2019s ability to manage the \nsubproject review and disbursement process. Following ADB\u2019s satisfactory approval of the first \nthree subprojects, ADB may permit a $50,000 free limit per subloan, under which amount no prior \nADB approval of the subproject is required. ADB reserves the rights to request any supporting \nsubproject documents and not to reimburse or liquidate any subprojects that do not comply with \nthe ADB project implementation requirements. \n \n22.  Eligibility criteria. ADB funds will be used to finance all types of rooftop solar subprojects \nthat  are  financially  sound  and  comply  with  the  subproject  eligibility  criteria  and  approval \nprocedures as outlined in the PAM.  \n \nIII.  ATTACHED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n23.  Credit line implementation and monitoring will be supported by the attached TA. The TA \nis estimated to cost $1.0 million to be financed on a grant basis by the Asian Clean Energy Fund \nunder the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility. The government will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of counterpart staff and other in-kind contributions. The TA will address \ntechnical and implementation matters through (i) establishing technical guidelines and standards \nto be followed by borrowers, vendors, and accredited engineers; (ii) assisting in the development \nof a viable subproject pipeline to catalyze market demand for funds; (iii) supporting credit line \nimplementation review, monitoring, and reporting; and (iv) conducting capacity building and \nawareness training and workshops for stakeholders. With close coordination with the MOFMM, \nthe Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy will be the executing agency and the Sri Lanka \nSustainable Energy Authority  will be the implementing agency for the TA. The TA will be \nimplemented over the period of 2 years from November 2017 to October 2019. \n \nIV.  DUE DILIGENCE \n \n24.  ADB conducted detailed due diligence on (i) confirmation of existing power system \ninfrastructure readiness to handle the potentially rapid solar energy expansion; (ii) confirmation of \ngeneral market readiness, including available policy and regulatory support, and assessment of \nany potential financial impact on the CEB and LECO; (iii) validation of financing models (para. 4) \nto ensure market demand; and (iv) reviews of project implementation capacity including that of \nthe general finance sector and PFIs.  \n \nA.  Technical  \n \n25.  Technical studies for the proposed outputs were conducted by consultants engaged under \nthe project preparatory TA financed by ADB in coordination with the CEB and LECO. Although \nthe technical viability of rooftop solar systems has been well-established throughout the world \nover the past 20 years, system readiness continues to be a concern.24 ADB reviewed and found \nthe technical studies generally acceptable. The work undertaken indicates that the proposed \ntechnical solutions are feasible and execution arrangements are satisfactory. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n \n26.  An  evaluation  of  the  economic  viability  of  the  project  and  its  expected  economic \nperformance was undertaken through a cost\u2013benefit analysis by comparing with- and without-\n                                                \n24  For example, because of periodic load shedding, inverters must be capable of disconnecting from the grid in case of \ngrid failure, while still being able to operate and provide solar energy for captive use. \n ", "8 \nproject scenarios using ADB guidelines for economic analysis. The main economic benefits are \navoided fuel cost from replacement of conventional thermal generation and reduced carbon \ndioxide emission. The economic internal rate of return of the project was estimated at 17%, above \nthe assumed economic hurdle rate of 9%. The capacity and financial performance of the selected \nPFIs are sound in terms of capital adequacy, asset quality, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to \nmarket risks.25 Economic and financial internal rates of return on a set of illustrative sample \nsubprojects based on the three rooftop solar power business models are viable.26  \n \nC.  Governance \n \n27.  Financial management. A financial management assessment was conducted on the \nMOFMM and 10 PFIs in accordance with the ADB Guidelines for the Financial Management and \nAnalysis of Projects (footnote 25) and Financial Management Assessment Technical Guidance \nNote.27 The selection of the PFIs was mainly based on their institutional standing, existing rooftop \nsolar lending volume, and/or established relationship with ADB through the ADB Private Sector \nOperations  Department\u2019s  Trade  Finance  Program28 and  ADB\u2019s  Small  and  Medium-Sized \nEnterprises Line of Credit Project.29 Other PFIs could be added during the loan implementation, \nsubject to the government\u2019s request and the established ADB review process. The overall \nfinancial management risk for the project is assessed moderate. The PFIs are well regulated. \nStringent project review, monitoring, and reporting requirements have been established to ensure \ncompliance. The funds available to the PFIs will be allocated efficiently to maximize project impact \n(footnote 22). Candidate PFIs\u2019 basic financial strength has been assessed separately in a capital \nadequacy, asset quality, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity (CAELS) assessment and is provided \nin the linked document.30 The CEB and LECO could potentially be negatively affected by the \nrooftop solar power development over time, and this $50 million pilot project is critically important \nto help the government understand such an impact and explore future regulatory adjustments. \nThe potential financial impact of expanding rooftop solar schemes on these power utilities was \nassessed, and relevant covenants are included in the draft loan agreement.31 \n \n28.  Procurement. The MOFMM will monitor and cause the PFIs to monitor the subproject \nprocurement by following ADB\u2019s procurement requirements applicable to financial intermediation \nloans. All procurement to be financed under the project will follow stated eligibility criteria. ADB \nencourages  the  MOFMM  to  require  the  PFIs  and  sub-borrowers  to  adopt  internationally \ncompetitive bidding procedures to the extent possible when the amount of the investment is large \nand economy and efficiency can be gained through such procedures. For procurement of goods \nand services to be financed by subloans, the MOFMM will require the PFIs to ensure that prices \nare reasonable and relevant factors\u2014time of delivery, efficiency, reliability, and suitability for the \nsubproject\u2014are taken into account. \n \n29.

They will be incorporated in the subsidiary \nloan agreements. The MOFMM will ensure that the PFIs follow ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy.  \n \nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n30.  The project supports solar energy development in Sri Lanka. The benefits of rooftop solar \nenergy capacity additions include national benefits in terms of enhanced energy security and \nadditional electricity supply, contributing to inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic \ngrowth, and localized benefits of improvement of livelihoods and job creation at the subproject \nsites. The poverty reduction impact of renewable energy projects can be both direct and indirect. \nThe direct impact is through additional power generation, which supports economic activities and \nimproves the livelihoods of individuals, such as the provision of lighting, refrigeration, and other \nhousehold amenities. Indirectly, rooftop solar energy projects minimize negative environmental \nimpacts and improve the health conditions of the general public.  \n \n31.  The project incorporates some gender elements. ADB will conduct awareness campaigns \nincluding workshops for sector customers on a subloan application process and technical aspects \nof solar panel installations and operations. These workshops will target at least 30% women\u2019s \nparticipation. The draft loan agreement includes provisions on following the principles of gender \nequality to increase project benefits and impacts on women during project implementation.   \n \nE.  Safeguards \n \n32.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows. \n \n33.  Environment (category FI treated as C). All project installations are limited to rooftops, \nand no subprojects with new grid connections that require right-of-way will be financed. Rooftop \nsolar projects do not require an environmental clearance in Sri Lanka. After they reach the end of \ntheir economic life, the solar panel modules will be treated and disposed of in accordance with \nSri Lankan laws, guidelines, and regulations. As per the occupational, safety, and health act and \nthe regulation for the disposal of hazardous waste, health and safety issues will be properly \naddressed and electronic wastes will be collected, treated, or disposed of by certified licensees \nfrom the Central Environment Authority.  \n \n34.  Involuntary resettlement (category FI treated as C). The rooftop solar systems do not \nrequire land space and have no impact on involuntary resettlement. \n \n35.  Indigenous peoples (category FI treated as C). The rooftop solar systems do not \nrequire land space and have no impact on indigenous peoples. \n \n36.  The environmental and social impacts associated with the implementation of rooftop solar \nprojects, either commercial scale or residential scale, are negligible. Therefore, an environment \nand social safeguard management system is not required, and an environmental assessment \nreview framework is not required because of the uniform nature of the work carried out on a \ncountry-wide basis. However, a safeguards checklist has been developed for subproject selection \nover the power generation capacity of 1 MW that will be screened based on the checklist to ensure \nthat subprojects financed by the credit line have minimal or no adverse environmental, involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous peoples impacts. The screening will be undertaken by ADB TA \nconsultants who will provide necessary capacity building trainings to stakeholders including PFIs. \n \n37.  Climate change impact. The climate change risk screening confirms that the project has \nlow climate change risk. \n ", "10 \nF.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n38.
