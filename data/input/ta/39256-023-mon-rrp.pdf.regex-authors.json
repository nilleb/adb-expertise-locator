THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche  financing  facility  (MFF)  to  Mongolia  for  the  Urban  Transport  Development \nInvestment Program.1 \n \n2.  The program targets investments in urban transport and related urban transport services \nin Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia. This will improve connectivity; reduce traffic congestion; \nand promote sustainable, safe, reliable, and efficient transport.2 \n \nII.  THE INVESTMENT PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  The population of Ulaanbaatar has been growing rapidly. The city grew from about \n600,000  people  in  1989  to  over  1.2  million  in  2010,  representing  42.8%  of  the  nation\u2019s \npopulation (2.8 million). Migration to Ulaanbaatar is expected to continue in the future \u2014it is \nestimated that the population of the city will reach 1.4 million in 2020 and 1.7 million in 2030.3 \nDevelopment of sustainable urban transport for the growing population is one of the most \nimportant urban development issues facing the city. \n \n4.  Since 2000, the number of registered vehicles has increased by 4.4 times.4 An average \nof 35,000 private vehicles has been added annually, representing an average increase of more \nthan  25%  per  year.  The  increasing  number  of  vehicles,  unplanned  urbanization,  the \noverburdened transport system, and poor traffic management are contributing to congestion, \nreduced traffic safety, and deteriorating air quality. Although the total number of recorded traffic \naccidents has been falling after peaking in 2000,5 the number of traffic fatalities and personal \ninjury accidents relative to the number of registered vehicles remains alarming. An annual \nincidence of 7.5 deaths per 10,000 vehicles highlights the need for continued improvements in \nurban road safety and better protection for pedestrians. \n \n5.  Increased trip frequency and travel time, excessive fuel use, and high vehicle emissions \nare reducing the quality of life and causing health problems in Ulaanbaatar. Although there has \nbeen a rapid increase in motor vehicles, the majority of Ulaanbaatar residents rely on public \ntransport or walking. The congestion on the city\u2019s roads has reduced the speed, quality, and \nreliability of bus services. These problems are particularly acute for the poor because they face \nlonger travel distances and higher costs, ride in overcrowded and poorly maintained buses, and \nare most affected by the lack of infrastructure provision for pedestrians. \n \n6.  Ulaanbaatar needs significant investment in its public transport system to ensure access \nto economic opportunities and social services for all its residents, and to support inclusive and \nsustainable economic growth. There has been chronic underinvestment in public transport, \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) provided project preparatory TA. ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance to \nMongolia for Preparing the Urban Transport Development Project. Manila (TA 7156-MON). \n3  Japan International Cooperation Agency. 2008. The Study on City Master Plan and Urban Development Program \nof Ulaanbaatar City. Ulaanbaatar (June). \n4  From 1998 to 2011, the number of registered vehicles increased from 36,723 to 162,710. \n5  The World Health Organization estimates that Mongolia has the 18th worst traffic accident incidence in the world. \nThe capital city is home to about 43% of the total population of Mongolia but Ulaanbaatar routinely accounts for \nover 70% of annual traffic accidents in the country. \n ", "2   \nwhich has not kept pace with recent urban growth. The majority of buses are more than 10 \nyears old and in poor condition. Large parts of the trolleybus infrastructure are no longer \nfunctioning due to lack of maintenance, and service quality is deteriorating. About 40% of public \ntransport passengers are subsidized by the municipal budget, but the mechanism for allocating \nsubsidies  to  bus  operators  lacks  transparency  and  is  perceived  as  inequitable.  Most  bus \noperators lack the financial resources to renew and expand their bus fleets and provide an \nadequate level of service. \n \n7.  The road network in Ulaanbaatar has not been expanded to accommodate the increased \npopulation and vehicles. From 1990 to 2006, only two road construction projects were carried \nout, both financed by bilateral donor agencies. Between 2007 and 2011, only 42.5 kilometers \n(km) of new roads were constructed and 68 km of existing roads were rehabilitated. About 65% \nof Ulaanbaatar\u2019s road network is in poor condition. The road network is particularly deficient in \nthe  outlying  residential  areas,  where  over  700,000  people  live  (around  60%  of  the  city\u2019s \npopulation), including most low-income families. The lack of a reliable road network is a major \nbarrier to the provision of public transport to serve these areas. \n \n8.  The municipality  of  Ulaanbaatar (MUB)  city  master  plan  aims  to  develop  the  city\u2019s \ninfrastructure, including its urban roads, utility network, and transport system. The MUB road \nfund finances road network construction and maintenance works, but it is insufficient to cover \nthe city\u2019s needs. Although experienced in managing the existing urban transport system, the \nMUB needs to strengthen its capacity to (i) develop, implement, and enforce urban transport \npolicy  and  strategy;  (ii)  undertake  long-term  investment  planning,  capital  budgeting,  and \nfinancial  management;  and  (iii)  design  and  manage  urban  transport  projects  financed  by \ninternational development partners. \n \n9.  To  address  these  challenges,  Ulaanbaatar  requires  a  comprehensive  program  to \nimprove its urban transport system. This includes investments in infrastructure combined with \nmodern  traffic  management  technologies,  policy  reforms,  efficient  and  sustainable  public \ntransport services, and institutional development. \n \n10.  Development partner coordination. International development partners have played \nan important role in supporting urban transport development in Mongolia. In preparing the \ninvestment program, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has coordinated closely with each of \nthese partners to (i) ensure synergies with existing and planned international support, and (ii) \ncontribute to policy dialogue with the Government of Mongolia on introducing a financially \nsustainable  and  environmentally  friendly  transport  system  to  support  inclusive  economic \ngrowth.6 \n \n11.  Sector experience. Past transport projects in Mongolia have experienced cost overruns \nand implementation delays. ADB has taken steps to prevent cost overruns under the investment \nprogram through extensive due diligence of the cost estimates. All estimates are based on \nrecent bid prices from recent projects implemented by the MUB. Past implementation delays \nwere caused by problems with preparing bid documents, bid evaluation reports, and acceptable \nwithdrawal applications, and with evaluating bids. ADB intends to address the implementation \nproblems  with  a  multifaceted  capacity  development  effort  that  will  provide  international \nconsultancy support to the MUB. This will directly assist with, and provide on-the-job training in, \nevery aspect of procurement, project management, and implementation for the duration of the \nfirst tranche implementation period. \n                                                \n6  Development Coordination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "3 \n12.  Justification for financing modality. An MFF is proposed as the financing modality for \nthe investment program. Ulaanbaatar\u2019s urban infrastructure is growing very rapidly and urban \ntransport requires a range of complementary investments over the next decade. The investment \nprogram will enable ADB to provide the medium- to long-term commitment that the government \nneeds  to  improve  the  city\u2019s  urban  transport  system.  The  expected  cost  of  the  required \ninvestments is about $274.4 million, which is significantly more than ADB has been able to \nprovide under a single loan to Mongolia. The MFF modality allows ADB to include the full scope \nof the urban transport sector improvement under the investment program. It also enables ADB \nto sequence its financing in relation to the MUB\u2019s ability to implement the investment program. \n \n13.  Multitranche  financing  facility  constituents:  Sector  road  map  and  policy \nframework. ADB has had extensive dialogue with the government to formulate a sector road \nmap and capacity development program. This road map establishes medium- and long-term \nperformance objectives for the urban transport sector of Ulaanbaatar and draws up a series of \ntargets and actions to be implemented. The investment program will strengthen the MUB\u2019s \ninstitutional and implementation capacity and help it implement the road map, policy actions, \nand investment program. The road map implementation targets are incorporated as government \nundertakings for the MFF. \n \n14.  Strategic context. The investment program addresses ADB\u2019s strategic goals7 in the \nurban  transport  sector:  (i)  promoting  clean,  efficient,  and  sustainable  urban  transport; \n(ii) improving sector institutions, management, human capacity, and asset sustainability; and \n(iii) developing  and  improving  urban  transport  infrastructure  and  services.  The  investment \nprogram  objectives  are  fully  consistent  with  the  strategic  goals  of  the  country  partnership \nstrategy8 and ADB's transport sector operational plan, the Sustainable Transport Initiative.9 \n \n15.  Investment program. The investment program includes (i) construction of bus rapid \ntransit  (BRT)  infrastructure  (roads,  bridges,  and  stations);  and  (ii)  development  of  a  BRT \nsystem,  including  a  bus  management  system  (BMS)  and  bus  information  system  (BIS). \nNonphysical  components  include  institutional  capacity  development  in  the  urban  transport \nsector, support for local contractors, extensive on-the-job training in project management and \nimplementation, and sector reform initiatives adopted in the road map and policy framework to \nbe implemented with support from the capacity development TA. The link between the MFF \nphysical investments and the sector road map implementation will provide strong incentives for \nsector development and reform. \n \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n \n16.  The  impact  of  the  investment  program  will  be  sustainable  economic  growth  of \nUlaanbaatar promoted by a sustainable and efficient urban transport system and services. The \noutcome  will  be  development  of  efficient,  safe,  and  affordable  urban  transport  services  in \nUlaanbaatar. \n \n                                                \n7  Sector Assessment (Summary): Transport, and Information and Communication Technology (accessible from the \nlist of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Mongolia, 2012\u20132016. Manila. \n9  The Sustainable Transport Initiative, which was approved by ADB Management on 20 July 2010, has set a new \ndirection for ADB's transport sector efforts to promote more environmentally and socially sustainable transport \nsolutions in developing member countries in line with Strategy 2020. (ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term \nStrategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. Manila.) \n ", "4   \nC.  Outputs \n \n17.  Project  1.  Outputs  to  be  financed  under  project  1  will  be  (i)  developing  BRT \ninfrastructure (improve 7.7 km of road, expand the Peace Bridge for the BRT, and install 14.0 \nkm of electric trolleybus infrastructure [electric wires, feeder cables, and substations]) for the \nBRT system in the north\u2013south corridor of Ulaanbaatar; (ii) introducing a 14.0 km BRT line on \nthe  north\u2013south  corridor,  and  procuring  five  trolleybuses  and  vehicle  emission  testing \nequipment; (iii) installing an intelligent transport system (ITS) component (the BMS); and (iv) \nproviding resources for project management, detailed engineering design, and institutional and \npolicy development. In addition, ADB plans to prepare and provide TA to help the MUB develop \na performance-based contract for BRT operation, and improve the public transport management \ncapacity of the Public Transport Department. \n \n18.  Project  2.  Outputs  to  be  financed  under  project  2  are  expected  to  be  (i)  further \nexpanding the BRT infrastructure and services, including extending the BRT corridors (27.9 km) \nand installing trolleybus infrastructure (electric wires, feeder cables, and substations) in the \nnorth\u2013south, east\u2013west, and ring road corridors (11.1 km), upgrading bus depots, and procuring \nBRT  buses  and  trolleybuses;  (ii)  implementing  traffic  management  and  pedestrian  safety \nprograms, which will include improving geometry and pedestrian facilities of 10 urban road \nintersections; (iii) installing ITS components (BIS and e-ticketing system [phase 1]); and (iv) \nproviding  resources  for  institutional  development,  detailed  engineering  design,  and  project \nmanagement. \n \n19.  Project  3.  Outputs  to  be  financed  under  project  3  are  expected  to  be  (i)  further \nexpanding the BRT infrastructure, including improving 4.6 km of urban road as required for the \nBRT  system  and  installing  trolleybus  infrastructure  (electric  wires,  feeder  cables,  and \nsubstations) in the east\u2013west corridor; (ii) extending the BRT system, including extending the \neast\u2013west BRT corridor (22.6 km), constructing BRT bus depots and a bus\u2013rail intermodal hub, \nand procuring BRT buses and trolleybuses; (iii) expanding ITS components (BIS and e-ticketing \nsystem [phase 2]); and (iv) providing resources for project management, detailed engineering \ndesign, and institutional development. \n \nD.  Special Features \n \n20.  The investment program will help the MUB develop a sustainable, efficient, affordable, \nand environmentally friendly transport system that will prioritize public transport and traffic and \nroad safety. The BRT, as the core of the public transport system, will be underpinned by \ninfrastructure improvement, policy reforms, capacity development, and introduction of modern \nITS technologies. Introduction of the BRT-dedicated lines will significantly reduce passenger \ntravel time, which will provide more time for productive economic activities and improve the \nquality of life, especially for low-income residents. Use of environmentally friendly buses and \ntrolleybuses, combined with reduction of the overall bus fleet and use of private vehicles, will \nreduce vehicle emissions and contribute to reducing carbon emissions. The ITS components \n(BMS, BIS, and e-ticketing) will increase the efficiency and transparency of the public transport \nfinancial management and subsidy systems. \n \nE.  Investment and Financing Plans \n \n21.  The  investment  program  is  estimated  to  cost  $274.4  million  (Table  1).  Project  1, \ninclusive of taxes, duties, physical and price contingencies, interest, and other charges, is \nestimated to cost $78.4 million. \n ", "5 \nTable 1: Investment Program \n($ million) \nInvestment \nItem    Program  Tranche 1 \nA.

Interest during construction on Asian Development \nBank (ADB) loans has been computed at 1.0% per annum on the amount of the first tranche\u2019s loan from ADB\u2019s \nSpecial Funds resources and at the 5-year forward London interbank offered rate plus an effective spread of 0.4% \non the first tranche\u2019s loan from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources (OCR). Commitment charges for OCR loans are \n0.15% per annum to be charged on the undisbursed loan amount. \nNote: Numbers may not sum precisely because of rounding. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n22.  The government has requested an MFF in an amount up to $217.4 million from a blend \nof ADB's Special Funds resources, ordinary capital resources (OCR), and Global Environment \nFacility (GEF) grant funding to help finance a part of the investment program.10 Mongolia was \nreclassified as a group B country eligible for OCR financing on 16 August 2011.11 The MFF will \nconsist  of  three  tranches,  subject  to  the  government  submitting  related  periodic  financing \nrequests, executing the related loan agreements for each tranche, and fulfilling the terms and \nconditions and undertakings set forth in the framework financing agreement (FFA). The first \ntranche, for $61.4 million equivalent, will be financed from the Asian Development Fund (ADF), \nOCR, and GEF. The ADF loan for $30.2 million equivalent will have a 32-year term, including a \ngrace period of 8 years, an interest rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% \nper  annum  thereafter,  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  set  forth  in  the  relevant  loan \nagreement. The OCR loan for $29.7 million will have a 20-year term, including a 5-year grace \nperiod, an interest rate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate-\nbased lending facility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per year, and such other terms and \nconditions as set forth in the relevant loan agreement.12 A grant for $1.5 million will be provided \nfrom the GEF fund. The government will provide counterpart funding to finance civil works, land \nacquisition, and resettlement, and exempt the project from taxes and duties. \n \n23.  The MFF comprises blend financing from ADF, OCR and cofinancing up to the MFF \namount. Thus, the provision of any ADF resources is balanced by a corresponding reduction of \nthe available OCR financing and/or cofinancing (and vice versa), so that the total financing \nprovided by ADB will not exceed the aggregate MFF amount of $217.4 million equivalent. Any \n                                                \n10 The OCR financing will follow the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to London interbank offered rate-\nbased loans, subject to terms under individual loan agreements. The Asian Development Fund financing will follow \nthe special operations loan regulations, subject to terms under individual loan agreements. \n11 ADB. 2011.

The government has been \ninformed that provision of advance contracting and retroactive financing does not \ncommit ADB to finance the project. ADB may approve advance contracting and \nretroactive financing for subsequent tranches. \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's Loan Disbursement \nHandbook (2012, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank; ICB = international competitive bidding; MCUD = Ministry of Construction and Urban \nDevelopment; MEGD = Ministry of Environment and Green Development; MOF = Ministry of Finance; MOT = Ministry of \nTransport; MUB = municipality of Ulaanbaatar; PIU = program implementation unit; PTC = public transport committee; \nPTD = Public Transport Department; QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \nA.  Technical \n29.  The project team has prepared feasibility assessments of project 1, including the BRT \ninfrastructure  and  system  development,  ITS,  traffic  management,  and  pedestrian  safety. \nTechnical due diligence was performed for the investment program and included an assessment \nof the strategy and policy framework, road map, investment program, and specific investment \nproposals under the first tranche. The investment program is technically viable with technology \nchoices based on efficient and proven designs. \n \nB.  Economic and Financial \n30.  The economic internal rate of return for tranche 1 investments was calculated. The \neconomic benefits are travel time and vehicle operating costs savings. The analysis showed \nthat project 1 is economically viable, with an economic internal rate of return of 24.8% at a \n12.0%  discount  rate.  Sensitivity  analysis  confirmed  this  economic  viability.  The  sensitivity \nanalysis considered project economic viability under various scenarios. Economic and financial \nanalysis will be conducted for all future subprojects financed under the MFF. \n ", "8   \nC.  Governance \n31.  All works and goods to be financed under the MFF will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines. All consulting services to be financed under the MFF will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to \nand  discussed  with  the  government.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures  are  described  in  the  facility  administration  manual  (footnote  15).  A  financial \nmanagement and procurement assessment indicates that the MUB\u2019s financial management, \nreporting, procurement, and monitoring systems are satisfactory. \n \nD.  Poverty and Social \n32.  Project 1 will directly benefit residents along the BRT corridors and indirectly benefit \nabout 1.2 million urban residents by improving living conditions and the economic and urban \nenvironment in Ulaanbaatar. The potential beneficiaries are local residents, students, and road \nand public transport users. Businesses will benefit from greater people mobility and connectivity. \nThe poor and socially excluded will benefit from (i) better access to the city\u2019s activity centers, (ii) \naffordable  public  transport,  (iii)  better  living  conditions  and  less  pollution,  (iv)  employment \nopportunities, and (v) development of business activities after project completion. Project 1 is \ndesigned  as  effective  gender  mainstreaming.  The  gender  action  plan  for  the  investment \nprogram will ensure equal gender access to urban transport.16 Poverty, gender, and social \nassessments will be done in preparation for subsequent tranches to determine their respective \ncategorization and required actions. The BRT will include gender-responsive and universal \ndesign features and focus on pedestrian safety; ease of access for the elderly, children, and the \ndisabled; and public awareness. A parallel grant project focuses on road safety in school areas. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n33.  Environment. To comply with national laws and ADB requirements, an environmental \nassessment  and  review  framework  was  reviewed  by  ADB\u2019s  Regional  and  Sustainable \nDevelopment Department and the MUB. 17 Environment classification of project 1 is category B \nas it will not have significant irreversible or permanent negative environmental impacts during or \nafter  construction.  To  comply  with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard  Policy  Statement  (2009),  an  initial \nenvironmental examination was prepared and disclosed.18 The environmental management plan \nwill become an integral part of construction contracts. Assuming effective implementation of the \nmitigation measures and monitoring requirements outlined in the plan, project 1 is not expected \nto have significant adverse environmental impacts. Subsequent projects are expected to be \nclassified environment category B. \n \n34.  Resettlement. Project 1 has been classified involuntary resettlement category B. A land \nacquisition and resettlement framework has been prepared for the investment program; it was \nendorsed by the MUB and disclosed on ADB\u2019s website.19 It specifies compensation eligibility \nand entitlements, land acquisition and related conditions for subproject implementation, and \nmechanisms  for  the  preparation  of  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  plans  (LARPs)  for \nsubprojects.  Subsequent  projects  are  expected  to  be  classified  involuntary  resettlement \ncategory B. A LARP has been prepared for project 1 and endorsed by the government and the \n                                                \n16 Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n17 Environmental Assessment and Review Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n18 Initial Environmental Examination (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n19 Resettlement Framework (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "9 \nMUB, and has been disclosed to affected persons in the local language.

ASSURANCES \n37.  The government has assured ADB that implementation of the investment program shall \nconform to all applicable ADB policies including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the facility administration manual and loan documents. The government has given ADB \ncertain undertakings for the MFF, which are set forth in the FFA. Specific covenants agreed by \nthe government with respect to individual tranches under the MFF are set forth in the loan and \nproject agreements for the respective tranches. \n \n38.  ADB  will  consider financing  subsequent tranches  if  the government  adheres to  the \ngeneral agreement for the MFF as set forth in the FFA. Specific assurances for project 1 should \nalso be complied with by the government. Progress toward achieving the outputs and expected \noutcomes in the design and monitoring frameworks for the investment program and project 1 \nwill also be among the decision-making criteria for financing subsequent tranches under the \nMFF. \n \n                                                \n20 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n ", "10   \nV.
