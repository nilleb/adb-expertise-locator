INTRODUCTION \n1.  The regional capacity development technical assistance (TA) Strengthening Capacity of \nthe Developing Member Countries for Managing Credit Enhancement Products (CEPs) was \napproved  in  December  2008  and  financed  workshops  for  government  officials  in  eight \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs).1  The workshops trained officials in CEPs provided by \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and other providers of CEPs. They also included a session on \nsustainable development and CEPs. Participants used CEPs to structure model sovereign and \nnonsovereign projects.   \n \n2.  Nine workshops2 were held in the eight DMCs attended by 424 officials, compared with \nthe 150\u2013200 officials initially targeted. Of these, 297 completed a post-workshop evaluation, the \nresults of which will be included in a final report. Before the workshops, 87% of respondents \nindicated \"no\" or \"partial\" knowledge of CEPs provided by ADB. After the workshop, 74% of the \nrespondents indicated \"complete\" or \"almost complete\" knowledge (the target was 75%). The \nevaluations showed that the officials were also unfamiliar with the CEPs provided by other \nmultilateral development banks, export credit agencies, and private political risk insurers. \n   \n3.  Staff from ADB headquarters and the resident missions participated in the workshops. \nSupport and feedback on the workshops from country directors and their staff were positive.  \n \n4.  Given  the  positive  feedback,  country  directors  in  other  DMCs  have  asked  whether \nworkshops could be carried out in their countries. Officials in Mongolia and the Philippines, both \nof  which  were  included  in  the  phase  1,  have  requested  workshops  on  CEPs  for  senior \nmanagers. As there is insufficient funding available under  phase 1 of the TA, phase 2 is \nproposed.  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.3 \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n5.  Between  2010  and  2020,  Asia  needs  to  invest  about  $8  trillion  in  infrastructure.4  \nGovernments  and  their  development  partners  can  fund  only  a  portion  of  the  region's \ninfrastructure; the remainder will have to be funded by the private sector. Many DMCs continue \nto have enormous liquidity, but constraints to mobilizing it remain. New banking regulations \nmake the financing of projects in emerging markets more expensive and, therefore, potentially \nless attractive to borrowers. Uncertainty over the recovery of the global economy is accentuated \nby concerns about sovereign debt defaults. This will raise funding costs and make lenders more \nhesitant to lend to sovereign and nonsovereign borrowers. CEPs can mitigate some of these \nconcerns and risks, whether real or perceived, extend tenors of loans, and lower financing costs, \nthereby encouraging private sector investment in DMCs. This makes the workshops timely. Of \nthe participants who took part in the evaluation of the phase 1 workshops, 65% said they know \nof a concrete project in their country that could benefit from a CEP provided by ADB.   \n \n6.  Because  ADB  CEPs  are  not  well  known  in  many  DMCs,  the  organization  of  the \nworkshops proved challenging.  It was not always clear which institutions should participate and \nat what level. For example, should officials from infrastructure and financial institutions be the \n                                                \n1 Cambodia, the People's Republic of China (PRC), Indonesia, Mongolia, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Sri  \n   Lanka, and Viet Nam.   \n2 Two workshops were carried out in the PRC. \n3 The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 October 2010. \n4 ADB and ADBI. 2009. Infrastructure for a Seamless Asia. Manila and Tokyo.  \n ", "2   \nonly ones to attend as these are priority sectors for ADB, or should staff from other government \ninstitutions (e.g. tourism and industry) also attend. The workshop was open to officials from any \ninstitution in need of private sector financing, since the presentations were not limited to ADB \nCEPs.  In preparing for the workshops, the Office of Cofinancing Operations (OCO) discovered \nthat it was helpful for a pre-workshop mission to meet with senior government officials in each \ntargeted institution to brief them on ADB CEPs and the workshop and to encourage them to \nsend their staff. As a result of such missions, each government strongly supported the objective \nof the workshops and ensured they were well attended (an average of  50 people attended each \nworkshop).  The  pre-workshop  missions  also  helped  each  institution  to  identify  the  most \nappropriate staff to attend. The workshops were supported by the relevant human resources \ndepartments in the DMCs.   \n \n7.  Senior  government  officials  in  Mongolia,  the  Philippines,  and  Sri  Lanka  expressed \ninterest in learning more about CEPs, but noted that a two-day workshop was too long for them. \nIn the Philippines an undersecretary in the Department of Trade and Industry recommended to \nADB that it organize an executive workshop on CEPs for him and other senior officials.  Similar \nrequests were received from Sri Lanka and Thailand. These requests are consistent with the \nrecommendations of phase 1 that targeted briefings on CEPs be carried out with senior officials. \nInstead of organizing one-on-one meetings with senior officials during the workshop, it was \ndecided such meetings would be held before the workshop. Phase 2 will therefore include  a \npre-workshop mission, a half-day executive workshop for senior officials, and an expanded two-\nand-a-half day workshop for mid-level officials (including more case studies, as recommended \nby the participants in the previous workshops).   \n \n8.  The workshops, together with the guarantees that are currently being processed in ADB, \nhave generated interest on the part of some ADB staff to learn more about CEPs. OCO and the \nADB Staff Development and Benefits Division are working together to develop training programs \nfor ADB staff on CEPs. This will facilitate the structuring of projects using these instruments and \nincrease the level of commercial cofinancing in line with Strategy 2020\u2019s cofinancing targets.   \n \n \nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n9.  This TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Strategy 20205 and Financing Partnership Strategy.6  \nStrategy  2020  refocuses  ADB  operations  on  inclusive  economic  growth,  environmentally \nsustainable growth, and regional integration. The TA will help mobilize private sector financing \nfor  investment,  trade,  and  cofinancing;  strengthen  partnerships;  improve  governance;  and \npromote knowledge management. \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The expected impact of the TA is that DMC officials will make greater and more effective \nuse of CEPs over the next 3\u20135 years. The outcome will be that DMC officials will begin to use \nCEPs in financing arrangements with ADB. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n                                                \n5 ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020.  \n  Manila. \n6 ADB. 2006. ADB\u2019s Financing Partnerships Strategy. Manila.  \n ", "  3 \n11.  The TA will advise at least 200 senior and mid-level management DMC officials on using \nCEPs to mobilize private capital to facilitate trade and investment, including through public\u2013\nprivate partnership projects. Workshops will be held during 2011. One of the risks identified in \nthe design and monitoring framework is the potential for a lack of continuity as participants \nchange  their  responsibilities.  ADB  will  explore  with  the  Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee \nAgency, the political risk insurance arm of the World Bank Group, if it can make use of its \npolitical  risk  insurance center to  disseminate  information  about  political  risk  insurance  and \nguarantees to the workshop participants. To distinguish itself from the services already provided \nby  the  Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency,  OCO  will  also  explore  the  feasibility  of \ndeveloping a CEP blog under phase 2 so government officials can pose questions about CEPs \nand get answers from OCO. \n \n12.  A series of workshops will be carried out in targeted DMCs.7  OCO will consult with \nregional departments on the final list of countries for the workshops. The workshops will provide \nofficials with information about (i) CEPs from ADB and other providers of CEPs, including other \nmultilateral development banks, export credit agencies, export import banks and private political \nrisk  insurers;  and  (ii)  how  to  use  CEPs  to  mobilize  private  capital  to  facilitate  trade  and \ninvestment, including for projects structured as public\u2013private partnerships. Greater knowledge \nof CEPs will enable countries to facilitate investment and trade and strengthen South\u2013South \nand interregional trade and investment. \n \n13.  The workshops will cover the following topics: \n \n(i)  investment needs of DMCs and main sources of external financing; \n(ii)  overview of the global credit and investment insurance market; \n(iii)  country risk ratings; \n(iv)  political risk insurance and guarantees provided by the multilateral development \nbanks; \n(v)  political risk insurance and guarantees provided by the export credit agencies; \n(vi)  political risk insurance provided by private insurers; \n(vii)  risk participation (e.g. reinsurance, guarantor-of-record structure, unfunded risk \nparticipation); \n(viii)  other CEPs available (e.g. B loan programs); \n(ix)  sustainable development and the financial sector; \n(x)  application of CEPs to public\u2013private partnerships; \n(xi)  case studies (sovereign and nonsovereign projects). \n \n14.  The targeted audience for the workshops will be senior and mid-level managers at \nnational and subnational levels responsible for finance, the central bank, commerce, foreign \ninvestment,  infrastructure,  export  promotion,  manufacturing,  tourism,  risk  management, \nprivatization, energy, water, the financial sector (i.e., state-owned banks), agriculture, public\u2013\nprivate partnership financing, and transportation. While ADB does not finance some of these \nsectors, the workshops will describe the activities of other CEP providers that do. This is \nanother reason why the workshops have been well-received by DMC officials, as they provide \nthe participants with a wide variety of solutions to their financing challenges. OCO will continue \nto work closely with ADB's resident missions to identify the appropriate government institutions \nand staff to be invited to participate in the workshops. \n \n                                                \n7 The DMCs will include Bangladesh, India, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Nepal, and the Philippines. \n ", "4   \n15.  The workshops will be held in the capital city of each DMC for 2.5 days for mid-level \nmanagers and a half day for the executive workshop for senior managers. A total of 40\u201360 \nparticipants for the two-and-a-half day workshop is considered optimum, while a total of 10\u201315 \nparticipants is targeted for the senior executive workshops. \n \n16.  Follow-up workshops will be offered, subject to the availability of ADB staff and funding \nfrom ADB and/or a DMC institution.8 \n \n17.  ADB will not finance any undertaking or activity in the territory of any member country \nunless and until it has received from the government of such member country a letter of no-\nobjection or concurrence with response to such activity or undertaking. \n \n18.  For  the  workshops,  the  TA  will  allocate  funds  (for  travel  costs,  and  other  related \nexpenses) to engage consultants and to cover other operating costs (e.g., venue rental and \ninterpreter fees).   \n \n19.  The international consultants' responsibilities will include preparation of the workshop \nmaterials,  delivering  the  materials,  and  preparation  of  the  final  report.  The  international \nconsultants will work closely with OCO.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $250,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis from ADB's Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV), and will be administered by \nADB. The financing will cover remuneration, travel, and per diem for international and local \nconsultants, ADB resource persons, workshop-related expenditures, publication of reference \nmaterials,  and  miscellaneous  expenses.  A  cost  breakdown  and  proposed  financing  are  in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The TA will be executed by ADB and implemented by OCO, in collaboration with the \ncountry directors and Private Sector Operations Department representatives in the resident \nmissions. It is expected to start in the first quarter of 2011 and to be completed by December \n2011. Two international consultants will be engaged intermittently for an estimated 4 person-\nmonths to: (i) develop the materials for the workshops, including powerpoint presentations and \ncase studies; (ii) deliver the materials during the workshops; and (iii) prepare the final report.  \nOne national consultant will be engaged intermittently for an estimated 4 person-months to:\n                                                \n8  Since phase 1 was completed, the Human Resources Department of the Development Bank of the Philippines has \nrequested a separate workshop on CEPs for some of its staff. A workshop was held at DBP\u2019s office in July 2010. In \nSeptember 2010, the Center for Fiscal Risk Management, Fiscal Policy Office, Ministry of Finance in Indonesia, \nrequested  another  workshop  on  CEPs  for  33  government  officials  in  various  government  institutions.  This \nworkshop was financed by a grant from the Indonesia Resident Mission and was designed to provide the \nparticipants with a better understanding of credit enhancement and risk mitigation products available from ADB and \nother CEP providers and how their policies and practices can provide benchmarks and guidance in structuring \npublic\u2013private  partnerships  in  Indonesia.  At  the  end  of  the  three-day  workshop,  the  participants  used  the \ninformation about CEPs to structure the financing for a $3 billion power project in Central Java, and a $1.1 billion \nrailway project for the airport in Jakarta. The projects are being proposed as public\u2013private partnerships projects. \n ", "  5 \n(i) organize the logistics for the workshops (e.g., venue, meals, printing, and assembly of \nmaterials for workshop); (ii) coordinate with the resident missions to select the institutions and \nindividuals to participate in the workshops; and (iii) collate the evaluations of each workshop. \nThe national consultant will be based in OCO at ADB headquarters. Outlines terms of reference \nfor consultants are in Appendix 3. ADB will engage the international and national consultants in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time) \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging consultants. The proceeds of the TA \nwill be disbursed in line with the Technical Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time).   \n \n22.  OCO will be responsible for managing each of the workshops in close collaboration with \nthe resident missions. OCO will work closely with the international consultants to develop the \nmaterials for the workshops. OCO will also provide a member of staff to participate in each \nworkshop as a resource person. The resource person will prepare the opening and closing \nremarks for each workshop and deliver these as required. The resource person will also be \nresponsible for clearing in advance any public relations materials with ADB Department of \nExternal Relations about the workshop.  \n   \n \nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $250,000 on a grant basis for \nStrengthening Capacity of Developing Member Countries for Managing Credit Enhancement \nProducts (Phase 2), and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6    Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or  Assumptions  \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   and Risks \nImpact      Risk \n       \nDMC officials will make  DMCs request more   Feedback from mission  Credit markets tighten and \ngreater and more  cofinancing using  leaders on interest in  drive up financing costs, \neffective use of CEPs  CEPs.  cofinancing from DMCs  making financing costly even \nover the next 3\u20135    when using CEPs. \nyears.
