", " \nI.  INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Government of the Philippines requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to \nprovide  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  strengthen  its  capacity  to  successfully  develop  and \nimplement public\u2013private partnerships (PPPs). The TA is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy and \nprogram 2005\u20132007 1 and thrusts of the country partnership strategy 2011\u20132016 that is under \npreparation.  A  joint  fact-finding  mission  of  ADB,  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, and the Canadian International Development Agency was conducted on 6\u201313 \nDecember  2010,  which  agreed  with  the  government  on  the  TA\u2019s  objective,  scope, \nimplementation arrangements, and financing plan. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1.2 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Investment in infrastructure, a critical factor of economic growth, in the Philippines is \ninsufficient, and inadequate infrastructure is a major development constraint in the country.3 \nInfrastructure development has not kept pace with continued population growth and increasing \nurbanization. In 1980\u20132009, total infrastructure investment in the Philippines averaged 2.1% of \ngross domestic product (GDP),4 well below the recommended benchmark of 5% of GDP.5  \n3.  Private investment in infrastructure in the Philippines has decreased significantly due to \nweak governance. From a peak of 15.5% of GDP in 1997, private infrastructure commitments \nhave  declined  to  an  average  of  2.1%  in  2000-2009.  The  Philippines  has  had  successful \nexperience with PPPs in the power sector. However, due to weak governance and an increase \nin unsolicited proposals, successful private investment in other infrastructure sectors has been \nrather limited. \n4.  The PPP policy, legal, and regulatory frameworks in the Philippines are inadequate. The \nPhilippines was one of the first developing countries with a BOT law6 and a dedicated BOT \ncenter. However, enabling policy and legal and regulatory frameworks are not entirely clear or \nconsistently applied.  Many infrastructure projects  have not been competitively tendered as \nPPPs. Financial viability of several PPP projects has been undermined by the unwillingness or \ninability of the government to carry out its contractual agreements. Right-of-way acquisition \n(ROWA) processes and lack of adequate government budget for land acquisition have severely \nhindered implementation of PPP projects. Similarly, the inability of the government to grant an \nautomatic franchise has resulted in a high degree of uncertainty for private sector project \nproponents. A lack of schemes for viability gap financing for PPP projects with substantial \neconomic benefits but limited commercial viability has often resulted in a low response from the \nprivate  sector.  The  lack  of  credible  mechanisms  for  guaranteeing  risks,  particularly  for \nregulatory-related  risks,  is  one  of  the  major  deterrents  to  private  sector  infrastructure \ninvestment. \n5.  The government\u2019s institutional set-up and capacity are insufficient to effectively promote \nand implement PPP projects in the Philippines. The PPP Center lacks the necessary technical \ncapacity and authority to optimally perform its role as the government\u2019s central PPP unit. In such \naspects  as  PPP  strategy  and  policy  formulation,  updating  the  PPP  legal  and  regulatory \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n6 Republic Act no. 6957, dated 9 July 1990 (as amended by Republic Act no. 7718, dated 8 May 1994). \n ", "2 \nframework, and provision of expert PPP advisory services to other government agencies, there \nseems to be lack of clarity in delineation of responsibilities between the PPP Center and the \nBOT  Group  of  the  National  Economic  and  Development  Authority  (NEDA).  There  is  also \ninsufficient  clarity  on  the  delimitation  of  responsibilities  between  the  PPP  Center  and \ngovernment agencies, both at the central and local levels.  \n6.  In  the  Philippines,  systems  and  capacity  are  insufficient  to  prepare  bankable  PPP \nprojects. Government agencies have insufficient project preparation capacity to address the \nwide range of complex economic, financial, technological, institutional, social, environmental, \nlegal,  and  risk-sharing  issues  associated  with  large-scale  infrastructure  projects.  Many \ngovernment agencies lack sufficient resources to attract quality expert advice to help prepare \nbankable PPP projects. The Project Development Facility set up at the BOT Center in 1999 with \ndonor funding has essentially become nonoperational. \n7.  Banks in the Philippines dominate the country\u2019s financial system but are reluctant to \nprovide long-term loans (beyond 10 years) for infrastructure projects. Consortium lending, while \ngrowing, is uncommon among domestic lenders. The nonbank finance sector is relatively weak \nand underdeveloped. The corporate debt market remains small relative to other countries in the \nregion. Equity markets have not been very active in supplying risk capital for infrastructure. \nPension  funds  and  insurance  companies  are  relatively  small,  and  face  structural  and \nperformance issues that limit their ability to invest in infrastructure. \n8.  The government has shown strong commitment to moving the PPP agenda forward. In \nSeptember 2010, the former BOT Center was reorganized as the PPP Center and was attached \nto NEDA.7 The Project Development Facility has been revitalized as the Project Development \nand  Monitoring  Facility  (PDMF),  managed  by  the  PPP  Center  as  a  revolving  fund.  The \ngovernment allocated P300 million in the 2011 budget for the PDMF to help implementing \nagencies to structure, prepare, and competitively tender bankable PPP projects. Separately, \nsignificant funding has been earmarked in the 2011 budget for PPP projects in selected line \ndepartments. In addition, the government is in the process of developing an interim scheme to \nprovide access to long-term financing for PPP projects until a dedicated infrastructure finance \nfacility  can  be  established.  In  2010,  NEDA  initiated  a  review  of  the  BOT  law  and  its \nimplementing  rules  and  regulations.  The  government  demonstrated  its  top-level  political \ncommitment to foster PPPs, and presented a substantial number of prospective projects at the \ninternational PPP investment conference held in Manila on 18\u201319 November 2010. \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA's impact will be increased private sector investment in infrastructure. The TA\u2019s \noutcome  is  an  improved  government  capacity  to  promote,  develop,  and  implement  PPP \nprojects.8 \n                                                 \n7 Executive Order 8 dated 9 September 2010. \n8 A flow chart showing pre-implementation milestones for developing PPP projects in the Philippines with indication of \nsupport from this TA is presented in Supplementary Appendix A (available on request). ", "  3 \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities9 \n10.  The  TA  will  achieve  its  outcome  through  (i)  capacity  building  to  improve  the \ngovernment\u2019s  PPP  systems  and  capacity;  and  (ii)  funding  for  the  PDMF  for  preparation, \ncompetitive bidding, negotiation, and monitoring of environmentally friendly PPP projects.10 \n1.  Capacity Building \n11.  Output 1: Strengthened PPP enabling framework. The TA will help strengthen PPP \npolicies and procedures to improve the capacity of the government to competitively tender PPP \nprojects, develop PPP-related fiscal incentives and rules, improve coordination mechanisms of \nsector PPP plans, and mainstream environmental sustainability and gender equality aspects \ninto PPP policies and procedures. The TA will help review PPP-related legal and regulatory \nframeworks to, among other things, systemically address issues related to ROWA and granting \nof franchise for public utility PPP projects. The TA will also help the government develop \napproaches for viability gap financing for socially beneficial but commercially less-viable projects. \nThe TA will also help the government streamline and optimize the PPP institutional set-up to \nensure efficiency and effectiveness of the PPP system as a whole. \n12.  Output  2:  Strengthened  capacity  of  the  PPP  Center.  The  TA  will  provide \ncomprehensive capacity building support to the PPP Center\u2019s staff in various policy and project \naspects of PPP with specific emphasis on learning-by-doing activities involving participation in \nthe actual PPP transactions. The TA will help the PPP Center establish twinning partnerships \nwith its best-practice counterparts in other countries, and develop or improve PPP toolkits and \nmodel PPP agreements, including environmental risk and sustainability analysis and gender \nsensitivity assessments. The TA will also help improve the content and design of the PPP \nCenter\u2019s website, as well as develop a modern, web-based PPP management information \nsystem. \n13.  Output 3: Institutionalized PPP best practices. The TA will build capacity of PPP-\ninvolved staff in NEDA, Department of Finance (DOF), Department of Budget and Management, \nand other government agencies in such aspects of PPPs as project appraisal, risk assessment \nand  risk  sharing,  bidding  process,  legal  implications  of  PPP  contracts,  monitoring  and \nmanagement of project implementation.  \n14.  Output 4: Established long-term financing and risk guarantee mechanisms. The \nTA will support the government in developing the regulatory and institutional frameworks for an \ninfrastructure investment financing facility, which will also be provided with some initial basic \ncapacity building support. The TA will support the government in developing a credible risk \nguarantee mechanism to decrease the overall high level of uncertainty for the private sector with \nimplementation of PPP projects. \n2.  Funding of the Project Development and Monitoring Facility \n15.  Output 5: Well-structured bankable PPP projects developed. 11 The TA will augment \nthe P300 million allocated by the government to the PDMF, which will function as a revolving \n                                                 \n9 The TA design drew from the lessons learned by ADB in PPP-related projects in India and Indonesia, and global \nbest practices. Critical assumptions, potential risks, and the proposed mitigation measures are in Supplementary \nAppendix B (available on request). \n10 The TA will complement and build on the work of ADB\u2019s ongoing projects and initiatives on PPPs. Close coordination \nwith development partners and the private sector will continue through the existing coordination mechanisms. \n11 Delivery of this output will be delegated to the PPP Center. Taxation-related issues will be governed by the relevant \nprovisions of the TA framework agreement between the government and ADB, dated 8 February 1996. \n ", "4 \nfund. The PPP project development cost will be shared on a project-by-project basis, with 44% \ncoming out of the TA\u2019s cofinancing to the PDMF and 56% coming out of the government\u2019s \ncontribution to the PDMF. This will cover (i) project feasibility studies, assessment of PPP \noptions,  and  business  case  development,  including  environmental  and  social  and  gender \nsafeguards considerations; (ii) financial analysis and/or modeling and project structuring; (iii) \npreparation of the bidding documents and draft contract; and (iv) support throughout the bidding \nprocess and contract negotiations. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $17,700,000. ADB will provide $1,500,000 on a \ngrant basis financed by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The \nGovernment of Canada will provide grant cofinancing of $1,200,000. ADB and the Government \nof Canada will finance technical assistance as indicated in point (i) of para. 10. The Government \nof  Australia  will  provide  grant  cofinancing  of  $7,000,000,  of  which  $1,000,000  will  be  for \ntechnical assistance as per point (i) of para. 10, and $6,000,000 will be the cofinancing of the \nPDMF as per point (ii) of para. 10. Both the Government of Australia and the Government of \nCanada\u2019s  cofinancing  will  be  on  an  untied  basis  and  will  be  administered  by  ADB.  The \ngovernment will provide $8,000,000 equivalent, consisting of $1,000,000 in-kind contribution \n(office accommodation, transportation, remuneration of counterpart staff, and other support \nfacilities) and $7,000,000 for the PDMF. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.12 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The NEDA will be the executing agency. The PPP Center (attached to the NEDA) and \nthe  DOF  will  be  the  implementing  agencies.13 A  special  committee  of  the  NEDA  board\u2019s \nCommittee on Infrastructure will serve as the project steering committee and will provide the \noverall policy guidance.14 NEDA\u2019s Expanded PPP Group will act as the technical working group \nto the project steering committee.15 Oversight of the PDMF will be performed by the PDMF \nboard.16 The PPP Center will serve as secretariat for the PDMF board. A technical advisor \nrecruited by ADB will  advise the PDMF board on, among other issues, the quality of the \nsubmitted proposals for PDMF funding. The TA is expected to commence in April 2011 and be \ncompleted by July 2013. \n18.  Implementation of activities listed in point (i) of para. 10 will require 94 person-months of \ninternational consultants and 186 person-months of national consultants, to be recruited through \nfirms and through individual consultants' selection. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). The consultants will report to the NEDA and ADB. The outline terms of reference are in \n                                                 \n12 The financing and disbursements falling under activities in point (i) of para. 10 will be on a pro-rata basis. \n13 The NEDA deputy director general (National Development Office for Investment Programming) will be the executing \nagency\u2019s focal point. The executive director of the PPP Center and the DOF undersecretary (International Finance \nGroup) will be the implementing agencies\u2019 focal points. \n14 The special committee will be comprised of secretaries of NEDA (chair), DOF, Department of Budget and Management, \nDepartment of Transportation and Communications, and Department of Public Works and Highways, and co-opt other \nmembers, if needed. \n15 The NEDA\u2019s Expanded PPP Group, chaired by the NEDA deputy director general (National Development Office for \nInvestment Programming), will comprise NEDA staff on infrastructure (secretariat), public investment, project monitoring, \nlegal, information technology and from the office of the NEDA director general, with ex-officio membership from the \nDepartment of Finance (International Finance Group) and the PPP Center. \n16 Details on the proposed PDMF processes and procedures are in Supplementary Appendix C (available on request). ", "  5 \nAppendix  3.  All  disbursements  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n19.  Recruitment of consulting firms for delivery of output 5 (para. 10, point [ii]) will be \nconducted  by  the  PPP  Center  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants.17 Engagement of these consulting firms will be under an indefinite delivery contract \n(IDC) facility involving prequalification and retention (without commitment) for a 3-year period \nusing fixed budget selection, and selection for IDC assignments using quality-based selection \nbased on evaluation of a biodata technical proposal. An individual  international consultant \nspecializing in IDC design and implementation will support the PPP Center, and also help build \nits capacity and systems for efficient and effective recruitment of high-quality consultant advice \nfor  PPP  project  preparation,  including  development  of  procedures  for  IDC  facilities  and \nassignments. Selection of the firms for the IDC facility and the first IDC assignment will follow \nthe agreed procedures and will be subject to prior review by ADB. \n20.  The TA proceeds for PDMF cofinancing will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLoan  Disbursement  Handbook  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  detailed \narrangements agreed upon between the government and ADB.18 To facilitate timely payments \nunder the PDMF-financed project development consultancy contracts, the PPP Center will open \nwithin 1 month of TA effectiveness, and maintain and manage an imprest account in dollars at \nthe Land Bank of the Philippines. The maximum amount to be advanced to the imprest account \nwill not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditures to be funded from the imprest account, or \n10% of the TA PDMF cofinancing amount, whichever is less. The PPP Center will ensure that \nrecords, accounts, and related financial statements are adequately maintained according to \nPhilippine  Financial  Accounting  Standards.19 The  Commission  on  Audit  will  audit  project \naccounts, including the imprest account, and certified copies of such audited accounts and \nfinancial statements will be submitted to ADB in English not later than 6 months after the fiscal \nyear to which the report relates.20 \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n21.  The President recommends that the Board approve ADB administering a portion of \ntechnical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $7,000,000 to the Government of the \nPhilippines for Strengthening Public\u2013Private Partnerships in the Philippines, to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Government of Australia. If the Board approves ADB administering the \ntechnical assistance, the President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, will \napprove (i) ADB administering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of \n$1,200,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Canada, and (ii) ADB \nproviding the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a grant basis, to the \nGovernment of the Philippines for Strengthening Public\u2013Private Partnerships in the Philippines. \n \n                                                 \n17 The procurement capacity assessment of the PPP Center, which confirmed suitability of the PPP Center for delegating \nthe responsibility for PPP project development consultant selection, is in Supplementary Appendix D (available on \nrequest). \n18 Details on the disbursements of TA PDMF cofinancing are in Supplementary Appendix C (available on request).Taxation \nissues will be treated on the basis of the TA framework agreement between the government and ADB, dated 8 February \n1996. \n19 The TA will provide support to the PPP Center\u2019s finance division to strengthen its financial management capacity, \nincluding management of the imprest account. \n20 The disbursement arrangements are described in detail in Supplementary Appendix B (available on request). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets and  Data Sources and \nAssumptions and Risks \nSummary  Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nIncreased  For the next 3 years after TA  NSCB\u2019s Philippines  Stable macroeconomic \nprivate sector  completion:  statistical yearbooks  internal and external \ninvestment in      environments, internal \ninfrastructure   Gross value of public sector  Annual reports on  sociopolitical situation \nconstruction as percentage of  infrastructure availability,   \noverall construction gross value  including reports of DOF  Risks \nincreases on average by 2  and NEDA  Deterioration of the \npercentage points annually (2009    government\u2019s fiscal \nbaseline: 46.6%) a    situation \n    Weakening of government \nPrivate sector\u2019s investment in  World Bank Private  political will and support for \ninfrastructure (except in energy)  Participation in  PPP \nincreases by on average 5  Infrastructure Database  Business-unfriendly \npercentage points annually   decisions of the \n(2009 baseline: $947 million)  government or the \njudiciary \nThreatened stability of \nmajor banks \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved  At least five competitively tendered  Government reports  Approvals for an improved \ngovernment  PPP projects (except in the energy  including from DOF,  PPP enabling framework \ncapacity to  sector), of which at least two are  NEDA, and other line  are granted without delays \npromote,  gender-responsive,b are ready for  departments and agencies \nAppropriate incentives for \ndevelop, and  implementation by the end of June   \nprivate sector participation \nimplement PPP  2013  Annual reports of project \nprovided (e.g., risk \nprojects  sponsors and financiers \nguarantee mechanism, \nROWA) \n  \nRisk \nDelays in development of \nbankable PPP projects \ndue to capacity constraints \nOutputs  By the end of June 2013:    Assumption \n1.
