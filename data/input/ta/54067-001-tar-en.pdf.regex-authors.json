INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  provide  evidence-based \nsolutions for the development of an elderly health services management system in Yunnan \nProvince, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). The TA will (i) provide options for strengthening \nintegration of health services in the elderly care system, and (ii) provide an operational framework \nfor effective elderly health care systems in Yunnan Province.1 \n \n2.  The TA is aligned with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Strategy 2030 Operational \nPlan for Addressing Remaining Poverty and Reducing Inequalities, and emphasizes addressing \nthe health care needs of the aging population.2 The TA is in line with the Government of the PRC\u2019s \nnational health priority described in the Healthy China 2030 plan and the Thirteenth Five-Year \nPlan, 2016\u20132020, which advocates the need to support elderly care.3 The TA is included in the \nlist of projects agreed between ADB and the Government of the PRC on 22 January 2020.4  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  A longer life expectancy is an indicator of collective advances in economic, social, and \nhealth development. In the PRC, most people can expect to live to 65 years and older. In 2018, \nthe PRC had the world\u2019s largest population of elderly people aged 65 years and above, totaling \n167 million. The PRC\u2019s aging rate\u2014elderly people aged 65 years and above as a proportion of \nthe total population\u2014rose from 7% in 2000 to 12% in 2018, and is expected to reach 14% in 2025, \nand  21%  in  2035.5 This  demographic  transition  to  an  older  population  has  fundamental \nimplications for all aspects of society, including family structure, long-term care (LTC), social \nprotection, and health. Longevity is contingent on continued good health and quality of life, but \nstudies show that aging involves various underlying physiological changes; higher risk of chronic \nand noncommunicable diseases, including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disorders, cancer, \nand dementia; as well as major burdens of disability arising from age-related losses in hearing, \nsight, and movement.6 With life expectancy increasing in the PRC at the rate of about 3 years per \ndecade (from 71.4 in 2000 to 77.0 in 2018), older people may spend an average of over 8 years \nliving with one or several diseases. \n \n4.  Aging is marked by multidimensional issues resulting from health needs that tend to \nbecome  more  chronic  and  complex.  Multimorbidity\u2014characterized  by  two  or  more  chronic \nmedical conditions of long duration\u2014is becoming the norm as life expectancy increases, and can \nresult in health conditions in older age that are not captured by traditional disease classifications. \nA 2018 study found that up to 75% of elderly people have at least one chronic disease, and more \nthan 40 million are partially or totally disabled.7 Yunnan Province had an estimated 5.7 million \nolder people (aged 65 or above) in 2014, accounting for 11.9% of its total population. This number \n \n1  Elderly care encompasses a wide range of services including assisted living, adult day care, long-term care, nursing \nhomes, home care, and social protection. Elderly health care pertains to care for the elderly in a health care setting. \n2  ADB. 2019.

China Releases Guideline to Improve Elderly Care (accessed 14 September 2020). \n ", "2 \nwill grow to 12.4% of the total provincial population in 2020.8 Multiple morbidities increase the \ncosts, duration, and complexity of medical care, and require a health care system equipped to \nmanage the key health issues of older age.  \n \n5.  It is critical to understand the variations in health care needs and conditions of the elderly \npopulation across the province to enable an appropriate approach to health care. A study \nsuggested  that  elderly  members  of  ethnic  minority  groups  have  higher  rates  of  chronic \nnoncommunicable  diseases than do  non-ethnic  minorities,  as  well  as greater  difficulties  in \naccessing health care.9 An assessment of the health care services available to the elderly \npopulation in Yunnan must be based on an understanding of the health profile, health care needs, \nand practices of the elderly from the 26 ethnic groups in the province. \n \n6.  The provincial health care system in Yunnan Province needs to adopt a more focused \napproach in order to improve quality and access to appropriate health services for older persons \nwith long-term care needs. At present, the health care system is organized to address individual \nacute health conditions rather than chronic conditions of old age, and is not prepared to deliver \nhealth care for older people that is integrated with local providers and across the continuum of \ncare settings (i.e., home, community, and institutional settings). Alignment of long-term health \ncare needs with the LTC system in Yunnan will be crucial to maintaining activities of daily living  \nand enabling integrated care\u2014which includes disease prevention, health promotion, rehabilitative \nand palliative care, and health-assistive technologies\u2014that is centered on the elderly. For-profit \nelderly health care providers account for a significant proportion of elderly care services, but are \nnot well integrated into the health care system. There are also lingering concerns with respect to \nthe capacity of caregivers, the efficiency of health care resource allocation, and the effective \nprovision and utilization of services, which are important challenges for provincial authorities and \npolicymakers. \n \n7.  The PRC Government, partially in response to population aging, has made health a \nnational priority as described in the Healthy China 2030 plan, with a central objective of fostering \nhealth for citizens of all ages (footnote 3). The Fourteenth Five-Year Plan, 2021\u20132025 will \nincrease the focus on elderly health care services, and provide an impetus for the enhancement \nof elderly health services and appropriate alignment of long-term health and LTC systems to \nbetter serve the older population of Yunnan Province. To be effective, this will require  expanding \nresearch on aging and allocating more funding for basic health and geriatric care services for the \nolder population. Implementing comprehensive research structured for Yunnan Province will \nenable more accurate identification of the unique characteristics of the elderly (including ethnic \nminorities), and their health care needs. This will inform the development of elderly health \nprograms focused on preventing chronic diseases, enabling the elderly to overcome chronic pain \nand difficulties while performing daily activities, and establishing a coordinated mechanism for \nLTC. Additionally, policy reforms are a prerequisite to implementing integrated health care \nresponses to the aging population; fundamental to the success of these responses are continued \ngovernment commitment, legislation, regulations, and plans for transforming systems for long-\nterm health care services and LTC provision. \n \n \n \n8  L.

The TA is aligned with the following impact: access to adequate elderly care services \nimproved.10 The TA will have the following outcome: elderly health service management system \nstrengthened.11  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Elderly health care services assessed. This output will facilitate contextual \nanalysis of the elderly population, including ethnic minorities, to enable formulation of policy \nrecommendations  and operational  strategies  for  advancing  elderly  health  services  that  are \nappropriate for the province\u2019s elderly population. The first stage involves (i) a desk review of \nelderly health care policies, regulations, and strategies in Yunnan Province regarding health, \nfunction, and quality of life of the elderly population, and an analysis of the national and provincial \npolicy environment, including elderly health care service standards and human resource plans for \nboth for-profit and non-profit services; (ii) key informant interviews with government officials; \nrelevant elderly health care, rehabilitation, and nursing home representatives; and caregivers in \nboth for-profit and non-profit settings; and (iii) preparation of a report that provides lessons and \nrecommendations for the province. The second stage consists of a survey of official ethnic groups \nin the province to analyze differences in health care needs, disease burden, and health-seeking \nbehavior among the elderly. This will generate data to guide the recommendations on appropriate \nmethods of providing long-term elderly health care services to indigenous communities. The third \nstage involves (i) a desk review of international best practices with respect to elderly health care \npolicies and regulations, standards, and practices in Japan, the United Kingdom, the United \nStates, and other countries that include for-profit and non-profit sectors; (ii) a desk review of \navailable relevant studies conducted in the PRC; and (iii) completion of a report on international \nbest practices and recommendations for elderly care and health care integration and provision \nrelevant to the province.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Policy advice for the development of a framework for elderly health care \nsystem finalized. Output 2 will establish an operational framework for an effective elderly health \ncare system in Yunnan. Building on research and analysis from output 1, output 2 will provide \npolicy recommendations for the development of an operational framework for elderly health care \nservices  comprising  oversight,  coalition-building,  institutional  arrangements,  regulation,  and \naccountability mechanisms. Options for an elderly health care system will be considered based \non cost-effectiveness. Consultations will be conducted to ensure feedback and input from for-\nprofit and non-profit private hospitals and facilities, primary health care providers, rehabilitation \ncenters, and nursing homes, including services for rural areas. This output will design the \nmonitoring  and  evaluation  system,  including  rule-based  and  output-based  indicators  for \nperformance measurement, and ensure continued quality of services as part of the policy and \noperational framework. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Knowledge  and  skills  on  elderly  health  care  service  management \nenhanced. The knowledge and capacity of the relevant agencies of Yunnan Province will be \nenhanced through targeted training and workshops to advance lessons and knowledge generated \n \n10  Government of the PRC, State Council. 2017.
