THE ENSUING PROJECT \n \n1.  Cambodia\u2019s agriculture sector is characterized as low value added, low productive, and \nnatural resource exhaustive. They are caused by: (i) poor and climate-vulnerable agricultural \nproduction  and  service  infrastructure;  (ii)  underdeveloped  agricultural  value  chains;  and \n(iii) unsustainable natural resources management exacerbated by climate change.  \n \n2.  The Agricultural Value Chain (AVC) Infrastructure Improvement Project1 (the project) aims \nto tackle the core sector problem of low productivity, low value addition, and low resource \nefficiency of Cambodia\u2019s agriculture with the following outputs: (i) post-harvest and logistic \nfacilities strengthened; (ii) agricultural production and service infrastructure improved; (iii) rural \nconnectivity improved; and (iv) business partnership among value chain stakeholders enhanced \n(see detailed description of the outputs in the concept paper). These outputs will result in the \nfollowing outcome: value addition to selected agricultural products in the project area increased. \nThe  project  will  be  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  value  addition  in  agriculture  sector \nenhanced.2 \n \n3.  The project is estimated to cost $76.0 million. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will \nfinance $70.0 million with a concessional loan of $67.83 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources and a grant of $2.17 million from the Asian Development Fund Disaster Risk Reduction \nFund. \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Justification \n4.  The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) is required to (i) assist in the design the \nproject; (ii) conduct financial and integrity due diligence of the potential participating financial \ninstitutions;  (iii)  carry  out  technical,  financial,  economic,  procurement,  social,  gender,  and \nenvironmental  due  diligence  required  by  ADB  and  the  government;  (iv)  propose  the \nimplementation  arrangements;  (v)  ensure  synergies  and  integration  with  other  related \ninterventions in ADB, Japan International Cooperation Agency and other development partners\u2019 \ncountry portfolio and project pipelines; and (vi) prepare the project documents according to ADB\u2019s \nrequirements. The TRTA will also provide support to incorporate climate change adaptation and \nmitigation measures in the designs of both public and private value chain infrastructure and \nfacilities and to enhance project readiness.3 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities  \n5.  Output A: Value chain analyses for selected agricultural products conducted. Based \non a set of agreed criteria at least six agricultural products will be selected that has substantial \npotentials for value addition and commercialization in the target provinces.4 Value chains of each \n                                                \n1   ADB. 2017.

They \n ", "17 \nproduct  will  be  separately  analyzed  to  identify  opportunities  for  value  addition  and \ncommercialization. Findings from the analyses will help identify, for financing from the project, \n(i) types and locations of critical public agricultural production and service infrastructure, and \n(ii) types and locations of facilities, materials, and capacities of farmers and agribusiness entities, \nand service providers in the same value chains (e.g., traders, logistic companies, financial \ninstitutions).  Inclusion  of  women\u2019s  involvement,  opportunities,  and  constraints  in  different \nsegments along the value chains will be considered in the analysis to the extent plausible. \nNational  and  local  consultations  including female farmers  will  be  conducted to  enable the \nparticipation of a range of stakeholders from both public and private sectors to contribute to the \nselection process. Output A will be delivered between September 2018 and December 2018. \n \n6.  Output B: Investment feasibility studies and due diligence prepared. For the selected \nagricultural  products,  criteria  for  and  a  list  of  preliminary  infrastructure  subprojects  will  be \ndeveloped. Such infrastructure will include farm-to-market road networks, market infrastructure \n(e.g., wholesale markets), and safety and quality testing and certification standards and system. \nFeasibility studies for those infrastructure subprojects will include a preliminary design with \nclimate-proofing measures, all environmental and social safeguards due diligence, as well as \nfinancial and economic analyses. For the farm-to-market road network, there will also be road \nsurface design measures identified where required to reduce flood risks. Farmer organizations or \nagricultural cooperatives, including female and male farmers\u2019 needs within the target provinces \nthat are engaged in the selected AVCs will be assessed in terms of infrastructure investments to \nidentify opportunities for them to invest in and benefit from the mechanization. Output B will be \ndelivered between September 2018 and February 2020. \n \n7.  Output C: Design of agricultural value chain financing mechanism(s) developed. An \nAVC financing modality will be developed and introduced project output 1. This will not be a \ngeneral small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing, but targeted financing to agricultural \nSMEs and cooperatives to strengthen value chain of selected agricultural products that have high \npotential for value addition in Cambodia. Current financing to agricultural SMEs and cooperatives \nwill be assessed. Constraints for the agricultural SMEs and cooperatives to access financing as \nwell as hindrances for financial institutions to provide financing to them will be assessed. Access \nof women-led or owned SMEs to financing will be assessed.5 Based on the assessment, the \nproject will design financing modality and products, and other supports such as technical advisory \nnecessary to address these constraints and hindrances. A capacity building program will also be \ndeveloped for selected agricultural SMEs in business planning and financial management, and \nfor working in partnership with producers. Financial and integrity due diligence will be conducted \nto identify the most suitable participating financial institutions to implement output 1. Within each \nof the selected AVCs, and in consultation with all stakeholders within these chains, the SMEs\u2019 \ndemand for investment including the establishment of preliminary processing or storage facilities \nfor the farmer organizations or agricultural cooperatives, the introduction or improvement of cold \nchains,  transportation  logistics,  product  collection  centers,  and  processing  facilities  will  be \nidentified. Marketing channels for end products will also be examined through the possible use of \ndirect sales to larger retail outlets as an alternative to channeling produce through wholesale \nmarkets. Output C will be delivered between September 2018 and July 2019. \n \n                                                \nare located along the course of National Highway No. 6 with the urban hub of Siem Reap at the center. The selection \nof the target provinces will be revalidated during the implementation of the TRTA. \n5  SMEs with at least one of the following (i) at least 50% of senior managers are women; (ii) at least 50% of enterprise \nownership is controlled by women; or (iii) at least 50% of the staff are women. \n ", "18 \n8.  Output D: Detailed engineering designs and bidding documents prepared. The \nTRTA will include rural road engineers who will do detailed engineering designs (DEDs) and \nprepare bidding documents of the subprojects. The topographic surveys will be carried out for \ndesign purpose. DED reports, drawings and bill of quantities of each subproject will be prepared \nand submitted to ADB and the government. The DED activities will be financed by the Project \nReadiness Improvement Trust Fund (PRITF).6 Output D will be delivered between April 2019 and \nApril 2020. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n9.  The TRTA is estimated to cost $2,094,000 million, of which $1,500,00 million will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the PRITF. Both grants will be administered by ADB. The government \nwill finance the remaining balance in-kind. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. \n \n10.
