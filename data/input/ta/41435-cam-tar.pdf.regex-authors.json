During the review of the country strategy and program 2005\u20132009 for Cambodia, the \nGovernment  of  Cambodia  requested  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  for  technical \nassistance (TA) to prepare the Tonle Sap Poverty Reduction and Smallholder Development \nProject.1,2 The ADB's TA Fact-Finding Mission visited Cambodia 17\u201326 October 2007 and \nreached  an  understanding  with  the  Government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs, \nimplementation arrangements, and cost and financing arrangements of the proposed TA.3 The \nTA is included in ADB's 2008 assistance program for Cambodia.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Poverty and Income Disparity. Despite Cambodia\u2019s significant economic growth in \nrecent years, the persistence of rural poverty and growing income disparity between rural and \nurban areas have become a cause of deep concern for the Government and its development \npartners. The Government is determined to reverse this trend by realigning its development \npriorities in the rural areas through the Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity, \nand Efficiency announced by Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen in 2004. Enhancement of the \nagriculture sector constitutes the first \u201cgrowth rectangle,\u201d which covers (i) improved productivity \nand diversification of agriculture, (ii) land reform and clearing of mines, (iii) fisheries reform, and \n(iv) forestry  reform.  The  Government\u2019s  Supreme  National  Economic  Council  (SNEC)  is \ndeveloping an action plan for the agriculture and natural resources sector under the Rectangular \nStrategy. To accelerate growth and development in the rural areas, the Government urgently \nneeds help to analyze and address a set of policy, technology, institution, and market-related \nissues,  and  to  design  and  implement  innovative  projects  that  can  be  integrated  with  the \nopportunities created by other sectoral developments. The Government has also announced an  \nagriculture and water sector strategy, based on the work done by the technical working group \non agriculture and water .4 \n \n3.  Low  Factor  Productivity.   The Tonle Sap Basin, home to a third of the country\u2019s \npopulation, has one of the country\u2019s highest poverty rates. One of the main causes of poverty in \nthis and other rural regions\u2014and for the growing income gap between urban areas and the \ncountryside\u2014is  lagging  productivity  in  the  use  of  land,  water,  labor,  and  capital.  Poor \nmanagement of resources is a major contributor, particularly in the Tonle Sap Basin. The \nabsence of proper land titles and tenurial security, together with complexities created by social \neconomic  land  concessions  have  resulted  in  underutilization  and  underinvestment  in  land \ndevelopment  and  land  preservation.  Inadequate  access  to  assets,  technology,  and  quality \ninputs  also  contributes  to  low  factor  productivity,  as  does  gender  discrimination.  Labor \nproductivity is depressed by a shortage of skills and training, and by poor health, nutrition, and \nsanitation. Insufficient access to capital, and low investment in social and physical infrastructure, \ncompound the situation. Productivity of capital is constrained by low technical and management \nskills, which also affect land and water productivity. Weak technical and institutional capacities \nacross public, private, and civil society agencies and organizations, together with inadequate \naccess to rural finance, dampen the prospects for factor-productivity growth.  \n \n                                                 \n1   ADB. 2007. Country Strategy and Program Midterm Review 2005\u20132009: Kingdom of Cambodia. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 November 2007. \n3  It was also agreed that a complementary advisory technical assistance will be needed for pilot technology \ndemonstration and ICT application for growth and diversification of agriculture through improved access to \ntechnology and market.  \n4  The technical working group on agriculture and water was created in September 2003 through an agreement \nbetween the Government and development partners to play a supportive and collaborative role in assisting the \nGovernment to progress agricultural development in Cambodia. \n ", "2     \n4.  Biosecurity of Agriculture and Natural Resources. Biosecurity for agriculture and \nfood production is a critical factor for growth and development of Cambodia\u2019s agriculture. It has \nthree dimensions: threats to biosafety and food safety; loss of environmental sustainability; and \nloss of biodiversity. Cambodia does not have the technical and institutional capacity needed to \nmanage national and international food safety and quality concerns\u2014a shortcoming that stands \nin the way of expanding and diversifying the agricultural export base. Safety concerns have held \nback  Cambodian  fish  exports  to  the  European  Union.    Growth  in  the  livestock  sector  is \nconstrained by transboundary animal diseases, such as classical swine fever, foot-and-mouth \ndisease,  and  highly  pathogenic  avian  influenza.  Animal  mortality  and  reduced  productivity \nthreaten the livelihoods of poor smallholders, and restrict regional and international trade. For \nCambodia  to  gain  entry  into  international  markets,  effective  safety  standards  have  to  be \ninstitutionalized in the certification of its products. This will also help to protect and preserve \nanimal and plant resources, and to ensure the health of its people. The country is also facing \nthe  depletion  and  degradation  of  its  natural  resources,  including  environmental  pollution, \npressure on the fishery, forestry, and the Tonle Sap ecosystem, and the loss of plant species \nand wildlife.  \n \n5.  Lack  of  Access  to  Information  and  Communication  Technology  (ICT).  As  a \nlatecomer to technological development, Cambodia can take advantage of the latest advances \nin ICT. ADB recognizes the importance of ICT in improving the access of the rural population\u2014\nand  of  the  rural  poor,  in  particular\u2014to  information,  knowledge,  and  services  for  rural  and \nagricultural development. The Government has given ICT a high priority under its Rectangular \nStrategy, where it is grouped under Rectangle 3 with transport, water, and energy. Given the \ncurrent  low  level  of  agricultural  productivity,  faster  growth  will  call  for  rapid  technological \nadvancement, which cannot occur without extensive use of ICT. The development of small- and \nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in particular, and the strengthening of their trade links, will \ndepend very much on accelerating the use of ICT in rural areas. Investment in hardware and \nsoftware  capacity,  skills  and  training,  power,  and  network  connectivity,  are  all  critical  to \nachieving that goal. Cambodia has made some headway with mobile phone technology but \nmost ICT infrastructure is concentrated around the capital city of Phnom Penh. The Government \nestablished the National Information and Communication Technology Development Authority in \n2000 to coordinate ICT policy development and application. Future progress is likely to be \nhampered,  however,  by  poor  technical  skills  and  institutional  weaknesses  at  the  central, \nprovincial, and local levels, and by a lack of credit support and incentives for the private sector \nand nongovernment organizations. More action is also warranted to develop and streamline the \nlegal and regulatory framework.    \n \n6.  Inadequate  Market  Development  and  Access.  This  is  a  perennial  problem  in  all \nemerging developing countries, and Cambodia is no exception. It undercuts the Government\u2019s \neffort to move towards market- and business-driven agriculture. Diversifying agriculture and \norienting  it  towards  exports  cannot  be  achieved  with  Cambodia\u2019s  current  low  levels  of \ncomparative and competitive advantage, and lack of regional integration. Improving market \nlinkages is  critical to making SMEs more trade-oriented by exploring beyond local markets and \npenetrating the foreign markets where there is demand for their products. Further problems \narise from fragmented markets, poor infrastructure, uneven flow of information, and the rural\u2013\nurban disconnect. In Cambodia, agricultural marketing remains largely local, and the linkages \nbetween producers, traders, and consumers are weak. Contract-farming arrangements that are \nseen  as  promising  models  for  future  agribusiness  and  agricultural  development  are  still \nundeveloped, except in few cases, like that of Angkor Kasekam Roungreung, which is a rice \ncontract-farming  model.  Appropriate  legal  and  institutional  guidelines  for  contract  farming \narrangements need to be developed to facilitate integration of smallholder farmers with the \nnational and international markets. Poor post-harvest technology for processing, storage, and \npackaging constrains market expansion and penetration in the same way that bio-insecurity and \n ", "  3\nlimited ICT do. Low private sector participation is another obstacle. It also restricts the growth of \nalternative employment and livelihood opportunities.  \n \n7.  The project for poverty reduction and smallholder development will consolidate gains \nand experiences from earlier ADB interventions in the Tonle Sap Basin under the Tonle Sap \nInitiative (TSI),5 and develop specific ways to foster the growth of factor productivity, promote \nbiosecure agriculture, improve market access, and increase the use of ICT in agricultural and \nrural development. The TSI focuses on the preservation of the resource base of the basin with \nthe end goal of uplifting the lives of the poor population in the surrounding provinces through \nsocial  infrastructure  development,  community  livelihood  support  for  alternative  income  and \nemployment  opportunities.  The  project  design  will  complement  and  be  consistent  with  the \nongoing and planned projects of ADB and other external funding agencies in order to accelerate \npoverty reduction in the Tonle Sap Basin. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The impact of the Project would be reduction in rural poverty, and improvement in the \nsocioeconomic conditions and quality of life for the poor people in the Tonle Sap Basin. The \nproposed TA would design a sector project that will (i) enhance the factor productivity in farm, \nnonfarm,  and  off-farm  activities;  (ii)  improve  access  to  product  and  financial  markets;  (iii) \nfacilitate the use of technology and/or market information through introduction of rural ICT; and \n(iv) attain biosecure agriculture.  \n \n9.  The TA\u2019s main outcome will be a design for the Project acceptable to the Government \nthat  will  (i)  increase  the  use  and  non-use  value  of  natural  resources  through  improved \nenvironmental management in utilization of agricultural, flooded-forest, and fishery resources in \nthe  Tonle  Sap  Basin;  (ii)  accelerate  income  growth  for  the  rural  poor  through  improved \nproductivity and diversification; (iii) increase participation by the rural poor in the domestic and \ninternational product and services markets; and (iv) integrate the rural poor into tourism and \necotourism development through production for the tourist market. The design and monitoring \nframework for the TA is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will be implemented in two parallel parts: (i) analytical studies and review of the \nexperiences of ADB and other development partners in the sector, both in Cambodia as a whole \nand  in  the  project  area,  and  (ii) project  and  subprojects  design,  including  social  and \nenvironmental  assessment,  financial  and  economic  analysis,  and  participatory  consensus \nbuilding at the grassroots with all stakeholders. Key tasks will be (i) to assess the overall state of \nthe economy and rural development; (ii) to assess the agriculture and water sectors in the \nproject area; (iii) to analyze poverty and alternative livelihood opportunities in the project area; \n(iv)  to  carry  out  gender  analysis  to  prepare  a  gender  action  plan;  (v)  to  prepare  an \nenvironmental profile of the project area, including resource degradation, pollution, and loss of \n                                                 \n5  The four ongoing and planned TSI projects\u2014Tonle Sap Environmental Management Project (Loan 1939), Tonle \nSap Sustainable Livelihood Project (Grant 0034/0035), Tonle Sap Lowland Rural Development Project (2007), and \nTonle Sap Watershed Management Project (2008)\u2013 have focused on resource management, capacity building, \nand infrastructure improvement in various agro-ecological and environmental zones of the Tonle Sap Basin, \ncovering   (i) fisheries, wildlife, and flooded forest protection; (ii) livelihood improvement; (iii) social and agricultural \nwater management and infrastructure development; and (iv) watershed management. In addition, the incoming \nRural e-Development Initiative is expected to support a broad-based intervention aiming at improving ICT policy, \nenvironment and capacity, rural communities\u2019 access to information and services, local contents and e-application. \n \n ", "4     \nbiodiversity; (vi) to examine all aspects of market, national, and international links, and supply \nand value chains; (vii) to review all technical and institutional aspects of biosecure agriculture, \nwith a particular emphasis on food safety and quality control; (viii) to assess the current state of \nICT application in agriculture and rural development, and develop an action plan; (ix) to examine \nthe potentials of, and constraints on, smallholder and agribusiness development; (x) to assess \ninstitutional, environmental, public-health, and social risks, and formulate measures to ensure \nadequate  safeguards;  (xi)  to  assess  the  benefits  of  the  proposed  project  on  agricultural \nproductivity, employment, external earnings, the role of women, the livelihood of ethnic minority \ngroups, the environment and public health; (xii) to formulate sector and subsector road maps; \n(xiii) to examine the performance and capacity of the relevant institutions; (xiv) to prepare a \ndetailed investment project proposal, together with subproject design; and (xv) to estimate \nfinancial and economic costs and benefits for the subprojects. The subprojects will specify \nactivities targeted to one or more specific components, and are expected to address the needs \nof specific target groups.  \n \n11.   A detailed proposal for an ensuing loan project will be formulated upon TA completion. \nThe project is expected to be implemented in selected communities of Siem Reap, Kampong \nThom, and Kampong Cham provinces that are relatively underdeveloped but have potential for \ngrowth and diversification. It is expected to reduce poverty among disadvantaged rural residents, \nand to help smallholders now engaged in mere subsistence activities to develop business \nenterprises. Special attention will be given to social issues specifically related to gender and \nethnic minority groups. An initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. The project will \nalso aim at reducing public health and environmental risks through (i) resource conservation \nmeasures, (ii) pollution control, (iii) improved practices in crop production, (iv) pest management, \nand (v) improved product processing, including the introduction of organic farming and rural \nrenewable energy. \n \nC.  Costs and Financing \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at the equivalent of $725,000. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance the equivalent of $500,000. ADB proposes to provide $200,000 \nequivalent  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB's  TA  funding  program.  The  balance  will  be \nfinanced by the Government of Finland on a grant basis up to $300,000, and administered by \nADB. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) will provide an equivalent of \n$150,000 in parallel financing that will support 6 person-months of international consultants, and \nmiscellaneous administration costs. The Government will provide $75,000 in kind to cover office \naccommodations,  counterpart  staff  support,  facilities  for  seminars  and  meetings,  other \nadministrative expenses, and part of local transport costs. The Government has been informed \nthat approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. A tentative cost \ntable is in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  The Supreme National Economic Council (SNEC) will act as the Executing Agency (EA). \nSNEC is responsible for developing the action plan for agriculture and natural resources under \nthe Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy, and is well-positioned to guide and coordinate the \nimplementation of the TA, which intends to develop a broad-based and innovative pilot-scale \nproject. Implementation will involve development by the EA of an operational plan for agriculture \nand natural resources, while preparation of subprojects is to be coordinated principally by the \nMinistry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the Ministry of Rural Development, the Ministry of \nCommerce, and National Information and Communication Technology Development Authority. \nThe  EA  will  appoint  a  project  manager  for  the  TA  and  provide  office  facilities  to  the  TA \nconsultants. An interministerial TA coordinating committee, chaired by the secretary-general of \n ", "  5\nSNEC, and comprising technical personnel designated by relevant ministries and departments, \nwill be established to act as a direct counterpart group for the TA, provide policy and technical \nguidance  for  the  TA,  and  facilitate  resolution  of  outstanding  TA  implementation  issues. \nRepresentatives of the target provinces will participate, as required. SNEC will also ensure \ninterministerial coordination with the relevant agencies of the Government, including the Ministry \nof Economy and Finance, council for agricultural and rural development, the Ministry of Industry, \nMines and Energy, the Ministry of Land Management, Urban Planning and Construction, the \nMinistry of Environment, the Ministry of Water Resources and Meteorology, the Ministry of \nEducation, Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of \nTourism,  the  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  and  Veterans\u2019  Affairs,  and  the  Ministry  of  Posts  and \nTelecommunications. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 9 months, beginning in January 2008 and \nending in September 2008. The TA will provide 26 person-months of consulting services\u201420 \nperson-months of international and 6 person-months of national consultants. IFAD will provide 6 \nperson-months equivalent services of an international social development specialist, a resource \nmanagement specialist, and an institutional development specialist for the TA. ADB will engage \nindividual  consultants  with  core  expertise  in  (i)  agricultural  economics  and  marketing;  (ii) \nbiosecurity and environmental and public health assessment; and (iii) ICT for rural development. \nThe consultants will be engaged in accordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2007, as amended from time to time). Unallocated budget may be used for additional inputs \nfrom existing experts or from new experts in areas such as social development, gender issues, \ninvoluntary  resettlement,  or  others  to  be  determined  during  the  TA  implementation.  The \ninternational agricultural economist and marketing specialist will lead the TA consultant team.  \nThe team leader will participate in the fact-finding mission for the ensuing project. Additional \ninputs will be drawn in from national experts conducting the special studies. The team leader will \ncontract out necessary studies and assessments to national individuals or firms, and purchase \nthe necessary office equipment in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as \namended from time to time). Equipment procured under the TA will be handed over to the \nGovernment upon TA completion. The proposed terms of reference for the consulting services \nare in Appendix 4.   \n \n15.  The TA will organize stakeholder workshops to disseminate the TA outputs, obtain \nfeedback  and  reviews,  refine  the  project  proposal,  and  ensure  close  liaison  with  key \nstakeholders at the national, provincial, and local levels. Tripartite review meetings involving the \nGovernment, the TA consultant team, and ADB will be organized at least three times at critical \nmilestone events. The consultant will prepare (i) a TA inception report, including a detailed work \nprogram, to be submitted within 3 weeks of the start of the TA, and to be discussed at the initial \ntripartite review meeting; (ii) an interim report to present preliminary findings based on the \ninterim results, to be submitted by the end of the fourth month of the TA, and to be discussed at \nthe interim tripartite review meeting; (iii) a draft final report 2 months before TA completion, to be \ndiscussed at national- and provincial-level workshops, and the final tripartite review meeting; \nand (iv) a final report incorporating all outputs upon TA completion. Key outputs of the TA will be \ntranslated into Cambodian as required. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n16.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of Finland, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not \nexceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Cambodia for \npreparing the Tonle Sap Poverty Reduction and Smallholder Development Project, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", "6    Appendix 1   \n        DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nData \nPerformance \nDesign Summary  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators \nMechanisms \nImpact  \u2022  Household income  \u2022  Database and  Assumptions \nEnhanced productivity and  from farm and  socioeconomic  \u2022  No major political, \nincome growth of rural  nonfarm sources  survey reports by  economic, or natural \nhouseholds in the Tonle Sap  combined increases  National Institute of  disaster shocks during \nBasin   doubles within 5 years  Statistics  project implementation \nafter project \n\u2022  Compilation of  Risks \nimplementation \nreports  and \n\u2022  Slowdown in policy and \n\u2022  By the end of project  statistics by SNEC,  \ninstitutional reforms \nimplementation,  MAFF and other \nexport growth is  concerned  \u2022  Slow progress in \naccelerated at twice  agencies    implementation of \nthe rate of GDP  complementary \n\u2022  Post project \ngrowth projected at 5- projects, especially \nsurveys and impact \n7% over medium  transport and power \nevaluation reports \nterm, and new \n\u2022  Annual Provincial \nproducts diversify \nstatistical records  \nexport base \n\u2022  Commune council \n\u2022  Quality and safety of \nassessment \ncountry\u2019s agricultural \nexports improved  \u2022  ADB review \nmissions and \n\u2022  Farmers and traders \nreports \nin the project area are \nbetter connected to \nmarkets and \ninformation through \napplication of rural \nICT  \n\u2022 50% increase in the \nparticipation of \nwomen and ethnic \ngroups in farm and \nnonfarm activities, \nand export and tourist \nmarkets by the end of \nproject \nimplementation \n \nOutcome  \u2022  An appropriate project  \u2022 Approved feasibility  Assumptions \nproposal together with  study report for \nAgreed-upon design of the  feasibility level design  selected  \u2022  Government prioritizes \nresulting project   of subprojects  subprojects  agricultural and rural \ndevelopment, and \nprepared and agreed \n\u2022 Signed MOU  continues to promote \nupon for possible ADB \nbetween ADB and  the decentralization \nfinancing within eight \nthe Government  and democratization \nmonths \nprocesses. \n \n\u2022  Government provides \n \ncounterpart support \n ", "Appendix 1  7\nData \nPerformance \nDesign Summary  Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets/Indicators \nMechanisms \nRisks \n\u2022  Powerful interests \ncontinue land grabbing \nor resource \nmonopolization. \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

\nLending/Financing  Project  Department/  Southeast Asia \nModality:  Division:  Deparment/Agriculture, \nEnvironment and \nNatural Resources \n       \nI.  POVERTY ISSUES \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nIn Cambodia, the agriculture sector accounts for about 34% of the country's gross domestic product, and about \n70% of the labor force. Although the sector's shares are expected to decrease due to the more rapid growth of \ngarment, construction and tourism sectors, the Government\u2019s Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, \nEquity, and Efficiency expects agriculture to be a driving force in accelerating economic growth and reducing \npoverty, especially in rural areas. The Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy paper also emphasizes the role \nof agriculture and rural development in poverty reduction. Rapid agricultural transformation is the only way out \nof extreme poverty in the Tonle Sap Basin provinces. The proposed project will help reduce poverty in the \nproject area, which is the home of more than a third of the country\u2019s population. Innovative ideas for poverty \nreduction will be tested in pilot schemes for possible replication in other parts of the country. \n \n \nB.     Targeting Classification          \n \n1.  Select the targeting classification of the project: \n \n General Intervention    Individual or Household (TI-H);  Geographic (TI-G);  Non-Income MDGs (TI-M1, M2, \netc.) \n \n2.   Explain the basis for the targeting classification:  \n \n \nC.  Poverty Analysis \n \n1.  If the project is classified as TI-H, or if it is policy-based, what type of poverty impact analysis is needed?  \n     A detailed analysis is required on the social and poverty impact of the ensuing loan project on the potential \nproject beneficiaries, in accordance with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s relevant guidelines on poverty and \nsocial  development,  and  standard  practices.  The  analysis  should  include,  as  baseline  information, \nsocioeconomic profiles of potential beneficiaries by income, poverty levels, gender, ethnicity, and other \nfactors. It should also assess their roles and needs in relation to the ensuing loan project. Available studies \nand reports on the poverty situation in Cambodia will be reviewed and complemented by participatory rural \nappraisals to be carried out in the potential project provinces. \n \n2.  What resources are allocated in the PPTA/due diligence? For PPTA: Six international consultants, including a  \nsocial development specialist, a resource management specialist, a biosecurity, environment, and public health \nspecialist, a specialist in ICT for rural development, a financial and economic analyses specialist, and an agricultural \neconomics and marketing specialist.   \n \n3.  If GI, is there any opportunity for pro-poor design (e.g., social inclusion subcomponents, cross subsidy, pro-poor \ngovernance, and pro-poor growth)? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "12   Appendix 2       \n \nII.  SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT ISSUES \n \nA.  Initial Social Analysis \nBased on existing information: \n1.  Who are the potential primary beneficiaries of the project? How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit from \nthe project? Smallholder farmers, fishers, livestock operators, rural women involved in farm, off-farm, and nonfarm \nproduction, processing, trading, and service-related activities are the potential beneficiaries of the project.  Poor ethnic \nminorities and socially excluded groups will gain improved access to inputs, technology, and markets, together with \nenhanced employment opportunities.  \n \n2.  What are the potential needs of beneficiaries in relation to the proposed project? \n      The beneficiaries would need (i) improved land, water, labor, and capital productivity; (ii) access to improved \ntechnology and markets; and (iii) access to ICT. Beneficiaries producing and processing for supply to upscale, tourist, \nand international markets would need knowledge and extension services for compliance with food safety and quality \nrequirements   \n \n3.  What are the potential constraints in accessing the proposed benefits and services, and how will the project \naddress them? \na. Increased Factor Productivity. Inadequate facilities, and lack of extension knowledge and information-delivery \ncapacity at the provincial and commune level, are major hindrances.  The project will overcome these obstacles \nthrough provision of extension and training services on improved cropping pattern, crop rotation, and farming systems, \nfocusing on environmental sustainability and market demands. \nb. Biosecure Agriculture for Smallholders.  The absence of a functional national food safety authority, and a lack of \ntraining and information programs, are major constraints. The project will strengthen the national food safety authority, \nand provide access to improved information, including awareness and training throughout the project area. \nc. Improved Access to Products and Financial Markets.  Lack of outreach, credit management, and capital base \nand savings mobilization are the main constraints in the financial markets. Obstacles preventing access to product \nmarkets include poor communications, and poor processing and storage infrastructure in some of the areas covered \nby the project. The project will support improvements of such infrastructure as farm-to-market roads and community-\nbased storage facilities. \nd. Development of Rural ICT.  A lack of backbone infrastructure for ICT and unreliable power supply can become a \nconstraint to access to and application of ICT by smallholders and rural households. The cooperation with private \nsector on satellite networks will be promoted through the project. \n \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n \n1.  Indicate the potential initial stakeholders. \n    Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Forestry  and  Fisheries,  Ministry  of  Rural  Development,  National  Information  and \nCommunication Technology Development Authority, Supreme National Economic Council, provincial authorities, \ncommune councils, civil society and nongovernment organizations, farmers, traders, processors, microfinance \ninstitutions are initial stakeholders in the project.  \n \n2. What type of consultation and participation (C&P) is required during the PPTA or project processing (e.g., \nworkshops,  community  mobilization,  involvement  of  nongovernmental  organizations  and  community-based \norganizations, etc.)? \nNational  and  provincial  stakeholder  consultations  will  be  carried  out  at  critical  milestones  during  the \nimplementation of the technical assistance (TA) for the sector analysis, formulation of the project proposal, \nand assessment of project impact and risks. In consultation with the TA Executing Agency, the TA will \nensure participation of the relevant government agencies, provincial governments, farmer groups, EM \ngroups, other external funding agencies, private enterprises, and civil society organizations. A specific \nstrategy for stakeholder participation will be worked out at TA inception as part of the TA work program. \n \n3.  What level of participation is envisaged for project design? \n     Information sharing          Consultation         Collaborative decision making         Empowerment \n \n4.  Will a C&P plan be prepared?    Yes          No    Please explain.  \n \n ", "  Appendix 2  13 \n \n \nC.  Gender and Development \n \n1.  What are the key gender issues in the sector/subsector that are likely to be relevant to this project/program? \nBasic hygiene, health standards, inequality in access to credit, technology and markets, and training for post-\nharvest processing are some of the key issues for women in the sector. In accordance with the Government's \napproved strategies and stated commitments, the ensuing loan project will incorporate specific measures or an \naction plan to ensure women\u2019s access to agricultural technology, information, and market facilities. \n \n     2.  Does the proposed project/program have the potential to promote gender equality and/or women\u2019s empowerment \nby improving women\u2019s access to and use of opportunities, services, resources, assets, and participation in decision \nmaking?       Yes          No    Please explain.  \nThe improved access to technology, information, and market will enhance women\u2019s participation in production, \nprocessing, and marketing. \n \n3. Could the proposed project have an adverse impact on women and/or girls, or widen gender inequality? \n        Yes          No    The ICT, biosecurity, and improved market access are new drivers for improving productivity in \nthe rural areas.  If women have less access to these project benefits, and if training and infrastructure are not designed \nto be women-friendly, the inequality can widen.  For example, women may not participate in training programs due to \ndistance and other obligations that differ from the men\u2019s. The project will design targeted activities for women and/or girls \nto benefit from ICT and extension services. \n \nIII.
