Despite the country\u2019s average annual economic growth rate of 7.8% during 2007\u20132012 \nand its significant wealth in natural resources, the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) \nremains highly dependent on official development assistance (ODA) to fund overall government \nexpenditures and its public investment programs.1 ODA disbursement totaled $431.6 million in \nFY2012.2 Although ODA will continue to be important in the short and medium term, it is likely to \nbecome less available as the Lao PDR moves toward graduation from least-developed country \nstatus  by  2020.  This  projected  decline  in  ODA  in  the  face  of  the  country\u2019s  continued \ndependence on external assistance requires not only that ODA be used more effectively but \nalso that a dialogue on policies to achieve that effectiveness be institutionalized.3   \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) country partnership strategy (CPS) for the Lao \nPDR for 2012\u201320164 has sought to maximize efficiency and sustainability by implementing \nlarger operations over longer periods. During its initial 18 months, the CPS, which aims at \npoverty  reduction  and  inclusive  and  environmentally  sustainable  economic  growth,  was \nsuccessful in this approach. ADB has continued to focus on four core sectors and made a \nsuccessful transition to fewer and larger projects in response to the government\u2019s capacity \nconstraints.  Nonetheless,  challenges  remain  in  maximizing  development  effectiveness  in \nimplementing the CPS, macroeconomic management and policy dialogue, continued start-up \ndelays of projects, and the absence of effective project readiness filters.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.     The  Lao  PDR  has  a  well-developed  aid  effectiveness  framework.5 It  includes  the \nVientiane Declaration on Aid Effectiveness,6 which is a localized version of the Paris Declaration \non  Aid  Effectiveness;  a  country  action  plan;  and  a  round  table  meeting  process  with \ndevelopment  partners.  The  government  is  committed  to  the  Accra  Agenda  for  Action.  A \nsecretariat  at  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  (MPI)  monitors  progress  made  in \nimproving  aid  effectiveness.  With  the  support  of  development  partners,  the  government \ndeveloped a results-based management framework for the Seventh National Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (NSEDP) for 2011\u20132015. It includes a monitoring and evaluation system. \nPreparations for the eighth NSEDP, 2016\u20132020 are underway. Although the aid effectiveness \nframework provides a solid foundation, implementation has been uneven. Further support is \nneeded to build capacity to make assistance more effective in a rapidly growing economy with \nchallenges  of  inclusiveness  and  to  use  public  resources,  including  ODA,  more  efficiently. \nSupport for 10 sector and thematic working groups established in April 2006 and co-chaired by \nrepresentatives of the government and of development partners will be instrumental in achieving \nthis and helping the government prepare the eighth NSEDP. The working groups are the main \nmechanism for coordination and policy dialogue at the sector and thematic levels in health, \neducation, governance, macroeconomics, trade and private sector development, infrastructure, \n                                                \n1  A.

Country Partnership Strategy: Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, 2012\u20132016. Manila. \n5  An overview of this framework can be found at www.rtm.org.la. \n6  The Vientiane Declaration on Aid Effectiveness was signed by the government and 22 partner countries and \norganizations during the 9th Round Table Meeting in Vientiane in November 2006. \n ", "2  \n \naction on unexploded ordnance, illicit drug control, agriculture and rural development, and \nnatural resources management and the environment. Some working groups meet regularly but \nsome do not.  \n \n4.      ADB co-chairs the infrastructure sector and the macroeconomic working groups. The \ntechnical assistance (TA) will provide support to help both these groups plan and manage in \ntheir areas of responsibility more effectively. The macroeconomic working group plans to create \na  better  understanding  of  issues  and  options  through  macroeconomic  analysis  and  policy \ndialogue. Areas of focus will include a macroeconomic framework, coordination of the country\u2019s \nfiscal and monetary policies, preparation of the eighth NSEDP, linking planning with budgeting, \nthe  Lao  PDR\u2019s  trade  policies,  and  its  responses  to  international  developments.  The \ninfrastructure sector working group will undertake studies and facilitate dialogue on improving \nthe prioritization of new infrastructure projects and the maintenance of existing assets.  \n \n5.  By strengthening the ability and performance of these two working groups in directing \npolicy, the TA will also help boost country ownership of development efforts and decisions. In \nline with the objectives of the Paris Declaration, the government will thus be able to exercise \nhigher quality leadership in development policies and strategies and better coordinate the efforts \nof development partners. The TA will also support core government programs that emphasize \nthe  need  for  capacity  development.  The  Vientiane  Declaration  has  introduced  capacity \ndevelopment frameworks to better align technical assistance and other capacity development \nmeasures with the needs of the government. The government also wants better sharing of good \npractices between sectors. \n \n6.  A country assistance and program evaluation of 2010 prepared by ADB\u2019s Independent \nEvaluation Department reported that continued project start-up delays in the Lao PDR showed a  \nneed to formalize, harmonize, and mainstream project readiness criteria.7 It stated that the \nperformance of ADB\u2019s portfolio in the country could deteriorate given its continuing expansion, \nand recommended that existing joint portfolio management practices of the government and \nADB\u2019s resident mission be strengthened. In 2012, 13% of ADB\u2019s projects in the Lao PDR were \nconsidered at-risk\u2014two actual problem projects and one potential problem project. The number \nof projects rated as potential problems during 2013, while fluctuating, has increased. The key \nissue was implementation delay, which in turn is mostly due to delays in establishing project \nteams and recruiting consultants.  \n \n7.  The MPI drafted standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the government in 2009 that \noutlined specific steps in ODA-supported project development to strengthen governance, but did \nnot translate them into Lao or disseminate them widely to the agencies expected to implement \nthem. They have been used only by some line ministries. In addition, line ministries have been \nreluctant to use project readiness filters (PRFs) introduced by ADB in 2011 to enable advance \naction to contract consultants immediately after a fact-finding mission. This reluctance reflects \nthe view in the government that the PRFs should first be integrated into the SOPs and that \nknowledge about the PRFs should be made available to staff of the line ministries before being \napplied.   \n \n8.  This TA project will build on previous TA for Capacity Strengthening for Enhancing Aid \nEffectiveness  and  will  further  enhance  the  MPI\u2019s  capacity  for  development  planning  and \n                                                \n7  ADB. 2010.

Manila.  \n ", "  3 \nformulation of sound policy advice. 8 The previous TA built capacity to make dialogue between \nthe government and development partners on transport and macroeconomics more effective \nand strengthened the ability of the Department of International Cooperation to more effectively \nmanage aid. The TA supported the development and delivery of training in institutional and \nregulatory frameworks and ODA management. The government has asked ADB for the new TA \nto further strengthen implementation of the aid effectiveness framework for ODA, to create a \nmore participatory process for systematic portfolio review, and to adopt formal project readiness \ncriteria.  The  TA  will  not  only  help  improve  the  effectiveness  of  ODA  but  also  further \ninstitutionalize and mainstream the outcomes of policy dialogue between the government and \ndevelopment partners; address systemic challenges in portfolio management; and enhance \ngovernment  ownership  of  portfolio  performance.  The  strengthened  systems  will  be  readily \napplicable to the ODA portfolios of other development partners. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  TA  impact  will  be  improved  alignment  of  ODA  and  government  priorities  and \nprocesses. The TA outcome will be strengthened country systems and mechanisms for policy \ndialogue to improve aid effectiveness. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA outputs will be (i) improved policy dialogue on aid effectiveness, (ii) reduced \nproject start-up delays, and (iii) strengthened government capacity for portfolio management of \nADB-financed projects. \n  \n11.  Output 1: Policy dialogue on aid effectiveness improved. The working groups on \ninfrastructure and macroeconomic management co-chaired by ADB with the relevant ministers \nand vice ministers are meeting only occasionally and with mixed results. Experience with other \nworking groups has shown that providing technical and logistical support can greatly enhance \nthe  functioning  of  working  groups  and  contribute  strongly  to  better  dialogue  between  the \ngovernment  and  development  partners.  The  TA  will  help  deliver  high-quality  policy \nrecommendations that will help the MPI formulate strategies and policies for the eighth NSEDP \nand strengthen the policy environment for infrastructure investments. The TA will build country \ncapacity to ensure consistency in the setting and sequencing of priorities in NSEDPs, beginning \nwith the eighth. It will also strengthen coordination structures and processes through wider \nstakeholder  participation.  Most  of  these  activities  will  easily  be  absorbed  by  the  regular \nbudgeting  process  and  provide  a  model  for  improvements  that  other  working  groups  can \nreplicate.  \n \n12.  Output 2: Project start-up delays reduced. Harmonizing the start-up arrangements \nbetween the government and those of ADB will lead to better implementation of ADB projects \nand  better  management  of  public  finances.  This  will  allow  advance  action,  including  the \nrecruitment of consultants and the finalization of the procurement plan for the first year of project \nimplementation  during  the  fact-finding  stage  of  project  preparation.  The  application  of \nharmonized SOPs by line ministries is essential to reinforce advance contracting between the \nfact-finding stage and loan effectiveness and thereby to reduce project start-up delays.

Manila. \n \n ", "4  \n \nwill help the MPI revise its current SOPs through consultations with government agencies and \ndevelopment partners, translate them into Lao, and disseminate them widely throughout the \ngovernment. Through similar consultations, the TA will also help revise the existing PRFs before \nthey are integrated into the SOPs. The SOPs themselves will be strengthened. The TA will also \ndevelop technical working papers to improve portfolio performance.  \n \n13.  Output  3:  Capacity  for  portfolio  management  of  ADB-financed  projects \nstrengthened.  Improving  portfolio  performance  and  the  predictability  of  disbursements  is \nimportant  to  support  government  ownership,  accountability,  and  transparency.  The  TA  will \nenhance the capacity of the government, particularly the MPI, to monitor project performance by \nstrengthening  institutional  capacity  to  conduct  portfolio  reviews  and  improving  coordination \nbetween ADB, the MPI, and the Ministry of Finance during quarterly and joint annual portfolio \nreview  meetings  with  the  World  Bank.  The  government\u2019s  capacity  for  managing  this  joint \nmonitoring system will be enhanced by improving the quality of the background documents and \nenhancing its ability to implement the reviews and monitor the decisions made. Case studies of \nsample projects will be undertaken and technical working papers prepared and shared by line \nagencies and development partners.  \n \nC.   Cost and Financing \n \n14.  The TA is estimated to cost $475,000, of which $450,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V). The government will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of remuneration of counterpart staff, office accommodation, \nutilities, and other in-kind contributions.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.   The  MPI  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  implementing  agencies  will  be  the \nDepartment  of  Planning  and  the  Department  of  International  Cooperation.  A  project \nmanagement unit will be established in the Department of International Cooperation to manage \nday-to-day activities, monitor progress, and submit progress reports to ADB and the Lao PDR \nResident  Mission.  Disbursements  under  the  TA  will  be  made  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). The TA \nwill be implemented from January 2014 to December 2015. \n \n16.   The TA will provide a total of 46 person-months of consultancy on ODA and portfolio \nmanagement, comprising 5 person-months of services from international consultants and 41 \nperson-months of services from national consultants. All consultants will be recruited on an \nindividual basis and engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2013, as amended from time to time), and all procurement will be also done in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n17.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic for Policy and Capacity Support for \nImproved Aid Effectiveness, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "Appendix 1           5  \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Data Sources and  Assumptions and Risks \nand Indicators with  Reporting \nBaselines  Mechanisms \nImpact  By 2018:    Assumption \n       \nImproved alignment of ODA  Use of country system  MPI progress reports   ODA commitments to Lao \nand government priorities  for  planning and    PDR are sustained in the \nand processes.  budgeting of ODA     medium term. \n  increases      \n    Risk \nMacroeconomic  Draft and final  Potential global \nframework clearly  version of the eighth  macroeconomic challenges \ndefines sector and ODA  NSEDP  adversely affect ODA \nfinancing priorities  commitments. \n \nOutcome  By 2015:    Assumption \n       \nCountry systems and  Meetings of  the two  Government website:  The government remains \nmechanisms for policy  working groups co- http://www.rtm.org.la/  committed to strengthen aid \ndialogue strengthened to  chaired by ADB held    effectiveness. \nimprove aid effectiveness  regularly and on     \n  schedule      \n       \n  Working groups\u2019 papers  Website and printed   \nand proceedings  publications   \npublished   \n   \nADB project start-up  PCR and other \nperiods reduced  to 2  monitoring reports \nmonths from an   \naverage 5 months    \n(2005\u20132012)    \n   \nADB Disbursement ratio  Country assistance \nincreased to 24% from  and evaluation \n18% in 2012   reports  \n   \nOutputs  By 2015:    Assumption \n       \n1.
