The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been supporting regional cooperation among \nBangladesh,  Bhutan,  India,  and  Nepal  through  the  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation (SASEC) program since 2001.1 In 2001 a transport working group was formed as \none of the six priority sector working groups. In 2003, ADB provided a regional technical \nassistance (TA) project2 to identify corridor-specific institutional and physical impediments to \nsubregional transportation that hamper the efficient operation of subregional transport corridors. \nThe  TA  identified  six  key  transport  corridors  in  the  subregion,  together  with  physical, \noperational, and institutional impediments thereof. In 2004, ADB provided a regional TA3 for \nSouth Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) to support the SAARC Regional \nMultimodal Transport Study. The TA identified 10 road corridors, 5 rail corridors, and 2 inland \nwaterway corridors over the SAARC region, together with the major physical and nonphysical \nbarriers that inhibit the efficient movement of intraregional freight, and developed an action plan \nto remove these constraints so as to enhance intraregional connectivity and trade.   \n \n2.  At the fifth SASEC transport working group meeting in 2006, SASEC member countries \nagreed to develop a regional transport and trade facilitation project to improve intraregional \ntransport connectivity, and endorsed the specific scope of the project. The SASEC country \nadvisors, convened in their fourth meeting on 4\u20135 June 2007, approved the project concept with \nits instruction for a minor modification of the scope. Subsequently, in July 2007 the ADB Fact-\nFinding Mission visited India and Bangladesh and reached an understanding on the objectives, \nscope, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA. This TA \nwas prepared on the basis of the outcomes reached at the fifth SASEC transport working group \nmeeting, the SASEC country advisors\u2019 meeting, ADB\u2019s subsequent Fact-Finding Mission and its \nreview of relevant data, studies, and reports.4 ADB management approved the TA concept \npaper on 11 August 2007. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n \n3.  South  Asia  inherited an  integrated  transport infrastructure  from  the  British,  but  this \ninfrastructure was fractured not only by the partition of India but also by its political aftermath, \nand now needs to be rebuilt within the context of greater political harmony in South Asia. Across \nthe mainland of South Asia, the original transport infrastructure is already in place but in many \nareas has fallen into disuse and needs upgrading. Apart from the inconvenience to travelers, \nthese barriers have raised the cost of travel and trade. \n \n4.  Integrating the transport network of South Asia is crucial to Nepal, Bhutan, and regions \nsuch as northeast India as it will end their landlocked or semi-isolated status. Within such a \nframework, Nepal, Bhutan, and the northeastern region of India would have the benefit of \nimproved access to the ports and important economic centers of the region, and a choice of \nroute and mode. The northeastern region of India is connected to the rest of India by a narrow \ncongested land corridor between Bangladesh and Nepal. This landlocked region, a natural \n                                                 \n1  The program has been supported through ADB. 2000.

", "2   \nhinterland to Chittagong (Bangladesh) port, trades with the rest of India and the world through \nthis congested strip of land. The costs of transporting goods to and from the northeastern region \nare  consequently  high.  Tea  from  Assam  is  shipped  to  Europe  via  Kolkata  port.  The \ntransportation costs include a trucking distance of more than 1,400 kilometers (km) through the \nland corridor around Bangladesh to Kolkata port. The traditional tea route for Assamese tea via \nChittagong port would cut the distance by almost 60%. Third-country trade for both Nepal and \nBhutan is also routed through this corridor to Kolkata port, with associated delays and costs. \n \n5.  Given the large potential for reduction in transportation costs, allowing the landlocked \nregion  of  northeastern  India,  Bhutan,  and  Nepal  access  to  Chittagong  port  through \nBangladesh\u2019s eastern border or to Mongla port through its northwestern border has been a key \nissue among concerned authorities, although no tangible result has been reached yet. This \nconcern and interest was explicitly expressed recently by SAARC. The first meeting of the \nSAARC Inter-Governmental Group on Transport, held in December 2006, endorsed to the next \nSAARC summit in April 2007 the construction of the identified missing link between Agartala \nand Akhaura, which would enable the landlocked region to access Chittagong port through the \neastern border of Bangladesh. The fourth SAARC summit, held in April 2007, approved the \nSAARC Regional Multimodal Transport Study that included the Agartala\u2013Akhaura rail link as a \nkey  transport  corridor.  Currently,  Indian  Railways  is  constructing  a  new  broad-gauge  line \nconnecting Kumarghat in Tripura (northeastern India) to Agartala. The connection of Agartala \nand Akhaura by rail and the transportation of imports and exports between the landlocked \nregion and Chittagong port will accelerate economic integration of the SASEC subregion and \npromote  mutual  prosperity.  The  SASEC  Subregional  Corridor  Operational  Efficiency  Study \nindicated  that  seamless  transit  transport  through  the  Kakarvitta\u2013Panitanki\u2013Fulbari\u2013\nBanglabandha  corridor  will  allow  Nepali  traders  to  have  easier  access  to  Mongla  port  or \nChittagong port in Bangladesh, which in turn will promote competition among transshipment \nports such as Kolkata/Haldia, and help lower logistics costs for Nepali traders.   \n \n6.  In addition to the provision of physical infrastructure, it is critical to lower the nonphysical \nbarriers in order to promote cross-border movement of goods, services, and people among \nSASEC countries. The current cross-border procedures in the SASEC subregion are both \ncumbersome and time consuming. Customs clearance procedures can add significant costs \nand delays, even though they represent a relatively small part of the logistics chain. Poorly \ndefined  or  complex  procedures  and  documents  reduce  transparency,  especially  when  the \napproval of many people is required. In the key border crossing point at Benapole (Bangladesh) \nand Petrapole (India), through which more than 80% of trade between two countries gets \nrouted, severe congestion results in long queues of trucks on both sides of the border and \nwaiting times of 1\u20135 days. It is known that more than 85% of the time spent waiting at the \nborder  is  spent  on  queuing,  customs  clearance,  and  transferring  cargo  to  Bangladeshi \nvehicles.5  To  mitigate  the  congestion  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  border  operation,  the \nGovernment of India is in the process of developing an agreement for cross-border truck \nmovement in consultation with the Government of Bangladesh, which, once endorsed and in \neffect, will drastically improve cross-border operations at Petrapole\u2013Benapole.  \n                                                 \n5  One of the biggest obstacles to the unhindered movement of goods between the two countries is that no truck of \none country is allowed to enter the other country, which in consequence requires transshipment of cargo from a \ntruck of one country to a truck of the other country at the border point. This practice poses an insurmountable \nimpediment to achieving an efficient cross-border management system. Free movement of trucks between India \nand  Bangladesh  will  be  a  requisite  to  enable  all  other  efficiency  improvement  measures  for  cross-border \nmanagement to become workable. ", "    3\nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  The regional TA will help promote subregional economic cooperation and integration \nbetween four SASEC countries. To this end, the TA will help SASEC countries prepare an \ninvestment project that will facilitate the unhindered movement of goods, services, and people \nacross  SASEC  countries  through  improved  cross-border  transport  infrastructure  and  the \nintroduction of modern cross-border management regimes.   \n \n8.  The TA consists of three components: (i) a road corridor component, (ii) a rail link \ncomponent, and (iii) a modernized cross-border regime component. The outputs of the road \ncorridor component include (i) the feasibility study and preliminary design of the Kakarvitta\u2013\nPanitanki\u2013Fulbari\u2013Banglabandha  road,  and  (ii)  an  economic  viability  assessment  of  the \nChittagong\u2013Akhaura\u2013Agartala road corridor as an extension of the Kakarvitta\u2013Banglabandha\u2013\nDhaka\u2013Chittagong  corridor  to  supplement  the  Agartala\u2013Akhaura\u2013Chittagong  rail  link.  The \noutputs of the rail link component will include (i) the feasibility study and preliminary and \ndetailed design for the Agartala\u2013Akhaura rail section, (ii) operational agreements for rail service \nbetween Chittagong and Agartala to be agreed by the two railways operators, and (iii) customs \narrangement  for  bonded  transit  between  Chittagong  and  Agartala.  The  modernized  cross-\nborder regime component will consist of three subcomponents: (i) trucking operations for the \nPetrapole\u2013Benapole border crossing, (ii) customs arrangements for transit cargo using the \nBirganj\u2013Raxaul, Phuentsholling, Kakarvitta\u2013Panitanki, Fulbari\u2013Banglabandha, and Petrapole\u2013\nBenapole border crossings, and (iii) trade-related infrastructure for four SASEC countries. The \noutputs  of  the  second  component  will  include  (i)  the  operational  framework  including  the \nnecessary bilateral or trilateral agreements for trucking operations and customs arrangements \nfor  transit  cargoes,  (ii)  defining  investment  requirements  together  with  preliminary  cost \nestimates, and (iii) identification of capacity-building needs and development of the necessary \ntraining programs. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n \n9.  Road Corridor Component. The component will (i) conduct the feasibility study and \nprepare  a  preliminary  design  for  the  Kakarvitta\u2013Panitanki\u2013Fulbari\u2013Banglabandha  road;  (ii) \nprepare a social development and environmental impact assessment, resettlement plan and, if \nneeded,  indigenous  peoples  development  plan;  (iii)  conduct  economic  analysis;  and  (iv) \nconduct an assessment for economic benefits and viability of the Chittagong\u2013Akhaura\u2013Agartala \nroad corridor as an extension of the Kakarvitta\u2013Banglabandha\u2013Dhaka\u2013Chittagong corridor to \nsupplement the Agartala\u2013Akhaura\u2013Chittagong rail link .  \n \n10.  Rail Link Component. The component will be implemented in two stages. During the \nfirst stage, the component will (i) review current practices of cross-border rail operations at the \nGedes\u2013Darshana  and  Singhabad\u2013Rohapur  border  crossings  currently  operational  on \nBangladesh\u2019s western border with India in line with the existing agreement; (ii) review the Indian \nRailways  feasibility  assessment  for  the  Agartala\u2013Sebrum\u2013Chittagong  link  and  assess  its \nsocioeconomic  costs  and  benefits  in  comparison  with  those  of  the  Agartala\u2013Akhaura\u2013\nChittagong link; (iii) develop an operational framework of rail services including the location of \ntransshipment of cargoes from meter gauge to broad gauge and the location of locomotive \nexchange; and (iv) develop customs clearance arrangements at both Chittagong and Agartala. \nDuring the second stage, the component will (i) conduct the feasibility study and prepare \npreliminary  and  detailed  design  for  the  Agartala\u2013Akhaura  section;  (ii)  prepare  a  social ", "4   \ndevelopment and environmental impact assessment, a resettlement plan and, if needed, an \nindigenous peoples development plan; (iii) undertake economic and financial analyses; and (iv) \nidentify additional investments for ancillary facilities and/or equipment. \n \n11.  Cross-Border Regime Component. The component will be implemented in two stages. \nDuring the first stage, the component will (i) review the existing arrangements in place for cross-\nborder trucking operations and customs procedures for transit cargo including the current truck \noperation at the Birganj\u2013Raxaul border crossing and the existing transit agreements between \nNepal and India and between Bhutan and India; (ii) review the planned approaches for cross-\nborder  trucking  operations  and  customs  procedures  for  transit  cargo  including  the  draft \ncomprehensive vehicle movement agreement currently under preparation by the Government of \nIndia and the SAARC recommendation adopted recently for customs procedures for transit \ncargo;  (iii)  develop  operational  frameworks  for  cross-border  truck  operations  and  customs \nprocedures for transit cargo to be adopted by relevant countries, including the draft bilateral \nagreements; and (iv) identify specific areas for institutional and financial assistance. During the \nsecond stage, the component will (i) develop draft bilateral or trilateral agreements for cross-\nborder  truck  operations  and  customs  procedures  for  transit  cargo,  (ii)  identify  investment \nrequirements and develop cost estimates together with a cost-benefit assessment, and (iii) \nidentify capacity-building requirements and develop training programs.   \n \n12.  The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent and will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. Detailed cost \nestimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 3. The Governments of Bangladesh, Bhutan, \nIndia, and Nepal have been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  Road Corridor Component. The Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways of \nIndia (MOSRTH), the Roads and Highways Department of Bangladesh, and the Ministry of \nPhysical Planning and Works of Nepal will be the implementing agencies (IAs). Each IA will \nappoint a project director (responsible joint secretary) who will act as a focal point for TA \nimplementation. The project directors from two IAs will appoint a project manager who will \ncoordinate and interact with the consultants. The project directors, project managers, and the \nconsultant team will constitute a project implementation unit (PIU) which will jointly conduct \nnecessary studies and design and draft reports. \n \n15.  Rail Link Component. Indian Railways and Bangladesh Railways will be the IAs. Each \nIA will appoint a project director and a project manager who will act as a focal point for TA \nimplementation. The project directors and project managers from two IAs and the consultant \nteam will constitute a PIU which will conduct necessary studies and design and draft reports. \nThe activities of the PIU will be overseen by the technical coordinating committee consisting of \nrepresentatives (joint secretary level) of the Ministry of Communications of Bangladesh, the \nMinistry of Railways of India, customs authorities of each country, and ADB. The technical \ncoordinating committee will review the PIU\u2019s reports, provide necessary guidance for revision, \nand endorse the reports from a sector perspective.   \n ", "    5\n16.  Cross-Border  Regime  Component.  For  the  cross-border  trucking  operations \nsubcomponent, the Ministry of Communications (Bangladesh) and MOSRTH (India) will be the \nIAs. For transit custom arrangements and trade-related infrastructure subcomponent, customs \nauthorities of four SASEC countries will be the IAs. Each IA will appoint a project director \n(responsible joint secretary) who will act as a focal point for TA implementation. The project \ndirectors from two IAs will appoint a project manager who will coordinate and interact with the \nconsultants. The project directors, project managers, and the consultant team will constitute the \nPIU, which will jointly conduct necessary studies and design and draft reports.  \n \n17.  Overall project-level coordination covering all components and subcomponents will be \nconducted by a steering committee consisting of representatives of the Economic Relation \nDivision of Bangladesh, the Department of Economic Affairs of India, relevant line ministries (for \neach of the components and subcomponent), and ADB. The steering committee will meet when \nthe draft final report is prepared and also whenever county-level coordination is necessary.  \n \n18.  Three separate teams of international firms, in association with national consultants, will \nbe engaged for the road corridor component, the rail link component, and the cross-border \nregime component using the simplified technical proposal procedures based on the quality and \ncost-based  selection  method  and  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The road corridor component will require 4 \nperson-months  of  international  consultancy  services  and  15  person-months  of  national \nconsultancy  services,  the  rail  link  component  will  require  6  person-months  of international \nconsultancy services and 26 person-months of national consultancy services, and the cross-\nborder regime component will require 10 person-months of international consultancy services \nand 27 person-months of national consultancy services. Three individual national consultants \nwill  be  separately  engaged  for  the  assessment  of  economic  viability  (3  person-months), \nenvironmental impact (3 person-months), and social and resettlement impact (3 person-months) \nof the cross-border regime component. The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix \n4. \n \n19.  The road corridor team will be based in Delhi (India); the rail link and cross-border \nregime team will be will be based in Dhaka (Bangladesh) and will make periodic trips to each of \nthe other countries as work demands. The IA for the road corridor component in India and the \nIA for the rail link and cross-border regime component in Bangladesh will provide the consultant \nteam with counterpart staff, secretarial service, furnished office space, office supplies, local \ncommunications  including  internet  access,  and  information  and  data  as  required  by  the \nconsultants. In the other countries, the IAs will provide temporary office accommodation. The \nTA will be implemented over a 6-month period from April 2008 to September 20086. \n \nIV.
