INTRODUCTION \n1.  The proposed capacity building technical assistance (TA)1 will support the provincial \ngovernment of Aceh and the provincial government of North Sumatra in developing integrated \nsupport to improve access to finance in Aceh and Nias, North Sumatra. The TA was first \nincluded in the pipeline of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in May 2011. The priority areas \ncovered under the TA were formulated based on discussions with the provincial Government of \nAceh, the provincial Government of North Sumatra, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA), the \nNational Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS), and the Ministry of Finance during ADB \nfact-finding and consultation missions. An agreement was reached with provincial government \nof Aceh and the provincial government of North Sumatra on the impact, outcome, outputs, \nimplementing arrangements, cost and financing arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. \nThe design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n2.  The  TA  is  fully  consistent  with  the  Government  of  Indonesia\u2019s  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan, 2010\u201320142 (RPJMN), which explicitly includes the government\u2019s aim to \nlower the poverty rate to 8%\u201310% by 2014 by implementing a pro-growth, pro-job, and pro-poor \ndevelopment strategy. The TA also supports the National Financial Inclusion Strategy.3 The \nstrategy  recognizes  that  improving  access  to  financial  services  is  essential  in  expanding \neconomic opportunities to poor households. Increasing access to finance for poorer segments \nof the population will not only encourage economic growth but also improve income distribution.  \nThe  TA  is  also  fully  consistent  with  ADB\u2019s  country  partnership  strategy,  2012\u20132014  for \nIndonesia.4 It supports the country partnership strategy\u2019s key pillar on inclusive growth. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Although commercial banks have expanded their size and branch network significantly \nover the last 2 decades, close to half of Indonesia\u2019s population still does not have access to \nformal financial services. About one-third of the country\u2019s population does not save at all and \ncan be considered financially excluded. Of those who save, about two-thirds use informal or \nsemiformal non-bank institutions. In terms of borrowings, commercial banks, which dominate \nthe  country\u2019s  financial  system,  serve  only  about  17%  of  the  population.  One-third  of  the \npopulation borrows from the informal sector; the rest (roughly 40%) do not have access to \ncredit.5   \n \n4.  The distribution of access to financial services across the country is also uneven, with \nplaces like Jakarta being over serviced relative to the rest of the provinces. Aceh, in particular, \nis significantly underserved. The amount of credit for working capital and investment relative to \nits gross regional domestic product is low at 7.8%, compared to the national average of about \n32.1%. This reflects the early stage of the province\u2019s recovery after the tsunami6 and the return \nof peace in 2004. In general, the financial sector still finds it difficult to properly price risks of \nfinancing longer-term investment in Aceh. As a result, the cost of credit has been relatively \nhigher  in  Aceh  than  in  other  provinces.  The  banking  sector  tends  to  focus  on  financing \nconsumption and avoids the agriculture sector despite the presence of some production clusters \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 25 October 2012. \n2   National Development Planning Agency. 2010.

Washington, DC.  \n6  On 26 December, 2004 a 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a \ntsunami that killed more than 240,000 people and destroyed most buildings and houses in Banda Aceh.  \n ", "2 \n \nthat have high growth potential. Non performing loans increased to 5.2% at the end of 2010 \nfrom 2.4% in 2009. The increase is partly attributed to the microfinance loans being extended \nwith local government involvement in the aftermath of the tsunami. Some recipients treated the \nloans as government assistance rather than as a commercial loan. \n \n5.  From year 2005\u20132010 after the tsunami, economic recovery in Aceh has been driven by \ngovernment spending and large reconstruction-related activities. Since 2010, the reconstruction \nactivities have declined significantly. At the same time, the mining sector (oil and gas) has been \nshrinking gradually and contributing negatively to Aceh\u2019s economic growth as output of the \nexisting plants is shrinking. Therefore, the province needs to diversify its economy rapidly and \ndevelop other sources of growth. While the manufacturing sector is still struggling to stabilize, \nagriculture\u2014the largest sector in Aceh\u2014has good prospects and is recovering strongly. Micro, \nsmall,  and  medium-sized  enterprises  (MSMEs)  dominate  the  business  landscape  in  Aceh, \nproviding 97.9% of total employment. While their numbers are still relatively small, most of the \nMSMEs are relatively new and many do not have an established track record with the banking \nsystem. They are in need of additional capital for expansion, but their access to capital has \nbeen constrained by the lack of collateral. The December 2004 tsunami and March 2005 \nearthquake also caused severe damage to Nias Island\u2019s infrastructure and economy, both of \nwhich were already weak prior to the disasters. Economic and social indicators in Nias Island \nare among the lowest in North Sumatra province and lag behind the national average for most \nsocial outcomes because of the island\u2019s remoteness and lack of access to services. As in Aceh, \neconomic recovery in Nias Island from year 2005\u20132010 has been driven mostly by government \nspending and reconstruction activities, which have declined significantly. \n \n6.  Providing  sustainable  access  to  finance  services  to  support  MSME  growth  and \ndiversification of the province\u2019s sources of growth is a key pillar of sustaining poverty reduction \nin Aceh. While the poverty incidence in Aceh declined to 21.0% in 2010 from 28.4% in 2004, it is \nstill much higher than the national average of 13.2%. In addition, poverty incidence across \ndistricts in Aceh varies considerably, from 8.6% in Banda Aceh to 28.0% in Pidie Jaya. \n \n7.  ADB provided assistance to support the recovery of the commercial microfinance system \nin Aceh and Nias Island under the livelihood and microfinance support (LMS)7 component of the \nEarthquake and Tsunami Emergency Support Project (ETESP). The LMS focused on rebuilding \nactivities and introducing Grameen-type microfinance to the provincial government-owned rural \nbanks and the private rural banks in Aceh and Nias Island. Under the LMS, ADB supported the \nmerger of Aceh\u2019s 12 provincial government-owned rural banks, allocated seed capital in the \nform  of  the  Microfinance  Revolving  Fund  (MRF),  and  provided  training  on  the  start-up  of \nGrameen-type microfinance operations. Because there were no rural banks in Nias Island, Bank \nSumut (the provincial development bank of North Sumatra) participated in the training activities. \nIn addition, ADB provided assistance8 to pilot commercial microfinance to Bank BPD Aceh (the \nprovincial development bank).  \n \n8.  ADB\u2019s earlier support and subsequent efforts to enhance the rural banking system in \nAceh and North Sumatra through LMS and MRF have provided a good base for improving credit \nexpansion in Aceh. However, Aceh is still in the early stages of improving access to finance. \nFurther  progress  is  needed  in  a  number  of  areas  including  (i)  managing  the  MRF  more \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2005.

The project completion memorandum of the ADB-provided grant assistance \n(footnote 8) suggests that capacity building needs to be sustained. The Government of Aceh \nand Bank Sumut have also requested further capacity building assistance from ADB. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact will be improved access to finance in Aceh and North Sumatra to widen \neconomic  opportunities  for  poor  households.  The  TA  will  enhance  the  capacity  of  key \nstakeholders by improving the environment for the expansion of sustainable and commercially \nviable microfinance programs in Aceh and North Sumatra.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will support the provincial Government of Aceh and the provincial Government of \nNorth Sumatra in developing integrated support to improve access to finance in Aceh and Nias \nIsland. On the supply side, the TA will (i) provide support to enhance the capacity of the  \nprovincial  governments  to  manage  the  MRF,  (ii)  assist  local  banks  in  developing  new \nmicrofinance products to meet the needs of selected community clusters supported under the \nLMS and to expand the market for Gremeen-type products and their suitable follow-on products, \nand (iii) support the Government of Aceh to develop a sustainable credit guarantee facility to \nlower lending risks and improve access to financing for credit-worthy borrowers. On the demand \nside, the TA will provide capacity building and assistance, on a pilot basis, to the community-\nbased cluster of producers to make them more bankable as a group or individually for more \nfinancial products. To encourage and sustain knowledge development in this area in both \nprovinces, the TA will involve local universities in survey and training activities. \n11.  Improved capacity of local governments in managing the MRF. The ADB-supported \nETESP included a grant of $8 million allocated to support microfinance expansion in Aceh and \nNias Island through the MRF. Initially, the MRF was managed by the central government \nthrough one of its state-owned enterprises (Penanaman Modal Mandani) to be used as a \nrevolving fund for microcredit extension in Aceh and Nias Island. So far, the MRF has not \nprovided optimal support for sustainable microfinance expansion in Aceh. While, the fund has \nbeen managed prudently to ensure its sustainability, the expansion of bankable borrowers has \nbeen rather slow due to constraints to extending microcredit beyond MSMEs operating in the \ntrade and service sectors. Recently, at the request of the two provincial governments, the \nMinistry of Finance decided to transfer the MRF to the two provincial governments. The capacity \nof the provincial governments to manage the MRF will need significant upgrading to ensure its \nsustainability. The consultant working under the TA will assist the two provincial governments to \nimprove their capacity to manage the MRF and identify sustainable microfinance extension \nprograms. \n12.  Enhanced  stakeholders\u2019  product  development  capacity.    Under  the  ADB  grant \nassistance for the restoration of microenterprise and microfinance (footnote 8), ADB and Bank \nBPD Aceh developed a pilot product known as Kredit Kemandirian Usaha (KKU) that focused \n ", "4 \n \non providing micro loans to enterprises. Bank BPD Aceh has adopted it as its permanent \nproduct line and has used its own internal funds to expand KKU. Likewise, the Grameen-type \npilot has shown good growth and ownership by both Bank BPD Aceh and Bank BPD North \nSumatra. In fact, the progress has been very rapid with very small non performing loans in Nias \nIsland and other parts of North Sumatra. The TA will provide trainings to assist in developing \nsuitable follow-on products for Bank Sumut\u2019s proven Grameen-type clients. In addition, the TA \nwill provide capacity building to Bank BPD Aceh and Bank BPD North Sumatra to support \nfurther product development efforts to better suit the needs of a selected cluster of producers \ninvolved in the production of tuna, patchouli, soft-shell crabs, and prawns. The initial analysis \nsuggests that these commodities have high export potential. In addition, the TA will also develop \na follow-on product for borrowers who have graduated from the Grameen-type and other Islamic \nmicrofinance products. \n13.   Improved capacity and readiness of local government to establish commercially \nviable  local  government  credit  guarantee  corporation  (LGCGC).  The  lack  of  qualified \ncollateral and local risks have been perceived as key constraints for credit extension in Aceh. As \npart of the tools addressing these constraints, the Government of Aceh is in the process of \nestablishing a LGCGC. The TA will facilitate the assessment and adoption of the best domestic \nand international practices, including the Japanese experience in providing a sustainable and \ncommercially-viable  credit  guarantee  system.  With  assistance  from  the  Japan  International \nCooperation Agency, two LGCGCs are now running in East Java and Bali. Bank Indonesia is \nplanning  to  replicate  the  two  successful  experiences  in  all  provinces  in  Indonesia.  The \nconsultant working under the TA will also support the Aceh government to establish a LGCGC \nin Aceh. \n14.  Enhanced  capacity  of  pilot  producer  clusters  for  better  access  to  financial \nservices.  Under two other ADB grants financed by JFPR,9 ADB provided support to pilot \nclusters of producers by linking them to better practices to improve their productivity, introducing \nthem to a new market with more efficient marketing channels, and accelerating the sharing of \ngood practices by developing a cluster information system for its members. The TA will maintain \nthe key support provided for selected community-based clusters such as producers of tuna, \nshrimp, soft-shell crab, cocoa, and patchouli. In addition, the TA will (i) improve production \npractices further to reduce the risks of default after receiving loans and (ii) make the cluster \nmembers more bankable for a wider range of financial products, including trade finance for \nexporters.  With  additional  support  to  improve  their  access  to finance,  the clusters  can  be \nexpanded more rapidly and replicated in other districts in Aceh. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $941,000, of which $800,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by JFPR and administered by ADB. The government will provide counterpart support in \nthe form of counterpart staff, office space, office communications, remuneration and per diem \nfor counterpart staff, and other in-kind contribution. The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n9  ADB. 2005.

Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months, from November 2012 to October 2014. \nMOHA, Director General of Regional Development, will be the executing agency. MOHA will \ntransfer TA to the provincial governments of Aceh and North Sumatra as the implementing \nagencies through a direct grant mechanism. A steering committee comprising of officials from \nMOHA, Bank Indonesia, BAPPENAS, and the provincial Government of Aceh and the provincial \nGovernment of North Sumatra will be formed to oversee the implementation of the TA. The \nsteering committee will facilitate efforts to share valuable national experience from other regions, \nwhich can be incorporated in the implementation of the TA. It will convene as needed and be \nregularly consulted on the implementation of TA activities. The provincial governments of Aceh \nand North Sumatra will ensure that key stakeholders participate in surveys and stakeholder \nconsultations. The TA consultants will administer workshops, training, seminars, conferences, \nand surveys.  \n \n17.  In consultation with MOHA and the provincial governments of Aceh and North Sumatra, \nADB will recruit consultants as required under the TA (52 person-months of consulting services, \nconsisting of two international consultants for 12 person-months and two national consultants \nfor 40 person-months). The team of consultants, led by the international consultant, will be \nresponsible for producing the TA outputs and deliverables in a timely and effective manner, and \nfor organizing and carrying out all TA activities. The terms of reference for consultants are in \nAppendix 3. The consultants will be selected and engaged on an individual basis by ADB in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).10 With a small number of consultants involved in the TA, it will be more efficient to engage \nconsultants on an individual basis. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). All \nprocurement under the TA will be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines \n(2010, as amended from time to time).    \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 to the Government \nof Indonesia to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction for \nImproving Access to Finance in Aceh and North Sumatra, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n                                                 \n10  Given the nature of the expertise required, it is deemed more appropriate to engage consultants individually rather \nthan hiring them through a firm. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Targets  and  Data Sources and  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved access to  Increased ratio of credit for  Bank Indonesia regional  The governments of \nfinance in Aceh and  capital investment to GRDP  economic reports   Aceh and North \nNorth Sumatra  (15% of GRDP in 2015;  Sumatra are willing to \n  baseline: 8.2% in 2010)  undertake the \nnecessary policy \nreforms required \n \nLocal capacity can be \nimproved for the \ntimely implementation \nof the support \n \nA good collaborative \npartnership between \nthe governments and \nthe stakeholders \n \nRisk \nPossible delay in \ninstituting reforms \nbecause of the \ngovernment\u2019s \nconsultative process  \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEnhanced capacity of  Issuance of policies  Government policy  There is a concerted \nkey stakeholders by  supportive of sustainable  papers  support at the local \nimproving the  and commercially viable    level for sustainable \nenvironment for the  microfinance programs     financial inclusion \nexpansion of     \nsustainable and  Increased credit growth to  Coordination \ncommercially viable  sectors (agriculture, trade,  between the \nmicrofinance  and fishery) in pilot  governments and \nprograms in Aceh and  activities   other partners is \nNorth Sumatra  (baseline: 8.9% June 2011)  effective  \n   \nReduced NPLs for  Risk \ncommercial banks and  Lack of concerted \nother microfinance financial  effort to implement \ninstitutions (agriculture)  the recommended \n(baseline: 26.8% June  policy reforms  \n2011)   \n \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
