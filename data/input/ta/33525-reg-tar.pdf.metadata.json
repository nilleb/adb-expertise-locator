INTRODUCTION\n1.  The  year 2000 work  program  of the  Operations  Evaluation  Office  (OEO)  comprises  41\nmajor  reports,  including  21  project  performance  audit  reports,  6  technical  assistance  (T A)\nperformance  audit  reports,  1  reevaluation  study,  4  impact  evaluation  studies,  6  special\nevaluation  studies,  and  1 country  assistance  program  evaluation.  For this  work  program,  the\noperational  departments  proposed  over  40  studies,  from  which  a  maximum  of  10  could  be\nselected  for completion  in 2000. The studies  recommended  by the operational  departments  and\nincluded  in the work  program  for year 2000  are listed  in Appendix  1. This  paper  describes  the\nregional TA    covering five  evaluation studies: (i) country assistance program evaluation for\n1 \nIndonesia,  (ii) assistance  for agriculture  and natural  resources  research  (ANRR),  (iii) gender  and\ndevelopment,  (iv)  sustainability  of  policy  reforms  through  adviso~  TAs,  and  (v)  policy-based\nprogram  lending  in selected  developing  member  countries  (DMCs).\nII. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  CEO has increasingly focused on thematic evaluations comprising impact evaluations of\nAsian  Development Bank (ADB) lending to  specific sectors, and  special  studies of ADB's\nprocesses and operations. This  is distinct from the earlier emphasis on  performance audit\n. reports  of  individual  projects  and  results from  a  recommendation of  the  Task  Force  on\nImproving Project Quality. While the evaluations are based on the results of individual projects,\nthe thematic approach is expected to widen the applicability of findings and to provide strategic\ndirection to future sector work and to country programming exercises. Such studies, which now\naccount for about 40 percent of OEO's evaluation studies, absorbed about $1.5 million in each\nyear, in 1997 and 1998. Acknowledging the operational relevance of this important activity, the\nPresident approved on 18 November 1998 an annual TA indicative planning figure, amounting\nto $1.6 million in 1999 for such evaluation studies. OEO traditionally selected topics for these\nevaluation studies in close consultation with ADB's operational departments.\n3.  The first TA    for evaluation studies completed in 1999 comprised six studies: (i) Impact\n3 \nEvaluation Study of Technical and Vocational Education Projects in Malaysia, Pakistan, Papua\nNew  Guinea, and Sri Lanka;4. (ii) Impact Evaluation  Study of  the  Role of  Nongovemment\nOrganizations and Community-Based Organizations in ADB projectS;5 (iii) Special Evaluation\nStudy  of  the  Effectiveness  of ADB  Approaches  and  Assistance  to  Poverty  Reduction  in\nBangladesh, Kyrgyz Republic, Lao People's  Democratic Republic, Nepal,  and Philippines;6\n(iv) Country Assistance Program Evaluation in the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam;7 (v) Special\nEvaluation Study on the Policy Impact of Involuntary Resettlement; and (vi) Impact Evaluation\nStudy of ADB Assistance to Key Sectors in Nepal. The first four studies were completed by the\nend of 1999.

The major findings and\nrecommendationsa re summarizedi n Appendix2 .\n4.  In preparingt he year 2000 work program, OEO considered the operational relevance of\nthe program and ADS's strategic objectives, policies, and operations. This TA comprises five\nstudies, which were originally recommended by ADS's operational departments.\n5.  Country Assistance Program Evaluation for Indonesia. Indonesiah as been an ADB\nDMC since ADB was establishedi n 1966. Indonesiah ad received$ 16 billion in loans from ADB\nas of 1998, and $142.4 million in TA grants.A  lthoughi ndividualp rojectsf inancedb  y ADB have\nbeen evaluated and thematic studies undertaken, no  comprehensive review or  impact\nassessmento f ADB operationsh as been carried out As ADB is evolving into a broad-based\ndevelopment institution that provides integrated packages of  investment financing, policy\nsupport, and capacity building, an overall evaluationo f ADB activities in Indonesiai s needed.\nThe study will evaluatet he operationals trategies.c ountrya  ssistancep rograms,l oans, and TA  s\nprovided to Indonesia, and assess their developmentali mpact. It will derive lessons and\nrecommendationsfo r use in future ADB operations.\n6.  Assistance for Agriculture and Natural Resources Research. ADB's involvementi n\nagriculturer esearch,w  hich commencedi n 1975,w  as modesti n the late 1970sa nd early 1980s.\nIn June 1983. a board paperBo n funding for agricultural research was approved, providing\nguidanceo  n ADB's prioritiest o fund agriculturalr eseard1s upportt o increasef ood produdion.\nSud1 support could contributet o poverty alleviation,o  ne of ADB's major strategic objectives.\nSince then, ADB's support to agriculturalr esearch increaseds ignificantlyt o an average of $1\nmillion to $2 million annually. ADB's priorities and emphasis to fund agricultural research\nbecame more focused in 1995 when its official policy was adopted,9w  hich recognized that\nresearch in agriculture and renewable natural resources conducted by various international\nresearch institutes and  national research systems has contributed substantially to  the\ndevelopmentp rocesso  f most DMCs. ADB's policy on ANRR has been implementedf or about\nfive years and funding of ANRR projectsh  as significantlyi ncreased. It is an opportunet ime to\nassess the appropriatenesse, ffectiveness,a nd impact of the policy and to determinew  hether\nADB's researchp rojectsh ave contributedt o the achievemenot f the strategico bjectives.\n7.  Gender and Development. ADB first adopted a policy on the role of women in\ndevelopment( WID) in 1985, emphasizingw  omen as a target group in its regular operational\nprogram.W  ith the adoption of WID as one of ADB's five strategic developmento bjectives in\n1992, ADB policy on WID gained reinforcement.A DB has now progressedf rom a WID to a\ngendera nd development( GAD)a pproacht hat allows gendert o be seen as a crosscuttingi ssue\ninfluencinga ll social and economicp rocesses.S  ince 1993,A  DB has approved2 9 projects for\n$1.3 million with WID and/or GAD as a primary or secondaryo bjective.M  ost of these projects\nare currently being implemented.I t is appropriatet o review these projectst o learn lessons on\nhow to improve the effectivenesso f gender in ADB's activities by assessingt he design and\nimplementationo f selected projects.

OEO  expects  to exchange  lessons  on  evaluation\nmethodology  and draw on other regions'  experiences  in gender impact assessment.\n8.  Sustainability of Policy Reforms through Advisory T As. ADB provides DMCs with a\nlarge  amount  of  TA  resources  for  carrying  out  policy  studies,  providing  advice,  supporting\nproject  preparation  and  implementation,  and enhancing  country  capabilities.  Since  1996,  ADB\nhas  spent  $1.6  billion  on 3,921  TAs.  In the  past few  years,  ADB  has  provided  on  average  of\n$160  million per annum  to support  over 200 TA projects.  A large  number  of these  are advisory\nT As to support governments  in drawing  up policy reforms and agenda  for change.  It is important\nto assess  the impact  of the past  interventions  and identify  the practices  most  likely  to enhance\nthe reform process  in a sustainable  manner,  through future TAs.\nPolicy-Based Program Lending. Program lending was introduced into ADB lending\n9.\noperationsi n 1978, with the emphasisc hangingi n 1987 from an input financing operationt o a\nfocus on improving the policy environment for enhanced\"s ector efficiency. The policy was\nrevised in 1996 and more recently in 1999. Notwithstandingth is, both programs departments\nand the Strategy and Policy Departmenth ave requesteda  n independentr eview by OEO of\nADB's policy-basedl ending instruments.T his was endorsedb y several Board membersd  uring\nBoard discussions on the latest program lending review paper, where they identified several\nspecific areas that should be included in the OEO study.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objectives\n10.  The TA will assess ADS operations and processes in the DMCs within each of the five\nthemes. It will also provide operationally relevant evaluation and feedback on the best practices\nand past shortcomings to strengthen ADS operations in the DMCs.\nB.  Scope of Activities\n11.  The TA   comprisesf ive studies.\n12.  Country Assistance  Program Evaluation for  Indonesia. The study will evaluate\nADB's operationala ctivities in Indonesia and assess their impacts. The study will (i) review\nIndonesia'sm  acroeconomice nvironment,t he Government'sd evelopmentp lans, and aid from\nother funding agencies;( ii) identify and discusst he key developmentali ssues and challenges\nfacing the country; (iii) review and assess ADB's operationals trategies and assistance plans\n(lending and  nonlending); (iv)  assess  the  impact of  the  operational activities from\nmacroeconomica nd sectoral perspectives;a nd (v) identify and discuss any resultant issues,\nlessonsl earned,a nd recommendationsfo r future consideration.\n13.

The special study intends to cover three projects (closed or ongoing) in each\nof three countries selected. In each country, the study will cover two ADB projects and one\nWor1dB  ank project.

Sustainability of Policy Reforms through Advisory TAs. The main objective of this\nspecial study is to assess the impact and sustainabilityo f ADB's policy refom1e fforts through\nadvisoryT  As. Since ADB has given a large numbero  f advisoryT  As in very diverse fields, it is\nimportant to select a group of broadly compatiblec ases. The study will focus on the broad\ntheme of policy refom1si n the public utilities sector, largely covering physical infrastructure\nservices.1OTh is choice is influenced by two factors. First, because ADB has in the past few\nyears devoted much resourcest o improvet he policy environmentf or the sector, it is important\nto assess overall impact of these TA  s. Second,g  iven the medium-tem1in vestmento utlook for\nthe public utilities sector in many DMCs, the study will help to identify and focus on important\nlessons so as to improve design and effectivenesso f future TA  . The study will use a three-\nphased approach: evaluation of concept and design, monitoring and implementation,a nd\neffectiveness.T he tem1p  olicy refom1si s used comprehensivelyh ere and will include aspects\nsuch as legislativea nd regulatoryr efom1,p olicyf or privates ector developmenta, nd humana  nd\ninstitutionalc apacityd evelopment.E ven though the study has to build on experience,t he main\nfocus of the studyw  ill be forward looking,t o enhancee ffectivenesso f these operationsi n future.\nThree or four countries are to be selected for this inquiry: Bangladesh,I ndonesia, Mongolia,\nand/orP  hilippines,s ubjectt o governmenta pproval.\n16.  Policy-Based Program Lending. The main purpose of the study is to evaluate the\nrelevance,e fficacy,a nd impactso  f the policy-basedp rograml ending since the 1987 change in\npolicy, and provide a critical analysis of and feedbacko  n lessons learned and best practices.\nSpecifically.t he study will (i) assess the quality, sustainabilitya nd long-termi mpacts of policy-\nbased program lending [(a) reviewingp  ast PPARs and project completionr epol1so f program\nloans; (b) examiningw  hether and how lessonsl earnedf rom past programl oans have been fed\ninto new lending; (c) conductinge valuation studies in 5-6 countries on the efficacy of policy-\nbased program loans, including sustainabilityo  f impacts and the perfonT1anceo f multiple\ntranched loans relativet o loans with 1-2 trancheso nly; and (d) assessingq uality of compliance\nwith covenants];( ii) review institutionala rrangementp olicies and practicesr elatingt o ADB and\nother funding agencies; and (iii) provide practicalr ecommendationso n the future direction of\npolicy-basedl ending. The study team will also liaise with the Economic and Development\nResourceC  enter,w  hich is revisingt he methodologyf or appraisal of program loans, including\nappropriate entry-level impact assessment indicators being essential for  any subsequent\nmonitoring.\n10D  epending on the final selection of countries, public utilities will cover network industries such as transport, energy\nor water sectors.", "5\nCost Estimates and Financing Plan\n17.  The total cost of the TA is expectedt o be $840,000e quivalent.T he TA will be financed\nby ADS on a grant basis from the ADB-fundedT A program.C  ost estimatesa re in Appendix3  .\nImplementation Arrangements\n18.  OEO will implement the TA  . Five OEO staff will independently carry out the studies, with\nthe assistance of international and domestic consultants. ADB staff will provide a total of 15\nperson-months of OEO's own human resources. About 22.6 person-months of international and\n29.0 of domestic consultants input are also required. The individual areas of expertise, duration\nof engagement of consultants, and outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4. In keeping with\nCEO's  guidelines  for  preparing  evaluation  reports,  each  OEO  staff  member  involved  will\nprepare a position paper'1 prior to engaging consultants and embarking on evaluation missions.\nIndividual evaluation  reports will be  prepared for each  study. Consultants will  be engaged\naccording to ADB's Guidelineso n the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory\nto ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. The TA will commence in mid-February\n2000 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2000.\nIV. THE PRESIDENT'S  DECISION\n19.

The regional technical assistance (TA ) for evaluation studies in developing member\ncountries,1o f the Asian DevelopmentB ank (ADB) compriseds ix studies. Four were completed\nby the end of 1999. While the impact evaluations tudy on the key sectors of Nepal has been\ndeferred,t he special evaluations tudy on the policy impact of involuntaryr esettlementh as been\nincluded in the work programf or 2000. The major findings of the four completed studies are\npresentedb elow.\nImpact Evaluation Study of Technical and Vocational Education Projects in\nMalaysia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka\n2.  The  one  lesson  that  stands  out from  the study  is that  \"one-shor  projects  do not work.\nThe  development  cycle  of  the  technical  education  and  vocational  training  subsector  and  the\nbaseline  status from  which  the projects  started  were  known;  it should  have  been obvious  from\nthe beginning  that  a single  projed  or even two projects  spaced  several  years  apart,  no matter\nhow well-designed  and well-implemented,  could  not establish  a sustainable  system.  What  this\nimplies  is  that  once  ADB  decides  to  assist  the  technical  education  and  vocational  training\nsubsedor,  it must be prepared  to provide  that assistance  on a long-term  basis.  Making  a long-\nterm commitment  is very much in keeping with ADB's  character  as a development  institution.\n3.  The  study  highlights  the importance  of strong  linkages  with  industry.  Operating  virtually\nin isolation  from  industry,  the polytechnics  of Pakistan  and the technical  colleges  of Papua  New\nGuinea  and Sri Lanka have deprived  themselves  of a number  of valuable  inputs.\n4.  Despite  the  numerous  constraints  faced  by the  project  institutions,  one  or two  in each\ncountry  stand  out above  the rest. It is invariably  the  leadership  that  makes  them  different.  In a\nhighly  centralized  and  bureaucratic  environment  vulnerable  to  political  pressures,  a  school's\nleader  must  possess  certain  characteristics  such  as  commitment  and  leadership,  if  the\ninstitution  is  to  prosper.  If  the  heads  of  project  institutions  had  possessed  most  of  these\ncharacteristics,  perhaps  the  project  performance,  especially  in Pakistan,  Papua  New  Guinea,\nand  Sri Lanka,  would  have  been  significantly  better  even  in the  same  operating  environment.\nThis is a lesson that future  projects  cannot  afford to overlook.\nB.  Special  Evaluation  Study  of the  Effectiveness  of ADB  Approaches  and  Assistance\nto  Poverty  Reduction  in  Bangladesh,  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Lao  People's  Democratic\nRepublic,  Nepal,  and  Philippines\n5.  The  lack  of  a coherent  country  strategy  for  poverty  reduction  makes  it difficult  to  put\ntogether  a comprehensive  poverty  reduction  portfolio,  and impossible  to evaluate  attainments  at\nthe  country  level  or  to  place  project  evaluations  in  a  context  that  allows  measuring  the\ncontributions  of  individual  interventions  to  an  overall  goal.  Government  policies  are  not\nsystematically  analyzed  as to their  implications  for the  poor,  nor is the commitment  to poverty\nreduction.  Without  these  basic analyses,  it will be difficult  to develop  a country-specific  poverty\nreduction  strategy.\nTA 5832-REG:E  v~etion  Stucies in the Bank's \u00a3)e~ping  Member Countries,f or $1 millon, approved on\n12 February1 999\nReference in text: (page2 , para. 3.)", "8 Appendix  2. page 2\n6.  None of the projects identified (i) the poor-to-nonpoor ratio of beneficiaries, (ii) the extent\nto which  project  benefits were  relevant  and important to  the poor  (as  compared  with  the\nnonpoor), (iii) the likely distribution of benefits among the poor and nonpoor. and (iv) what the\nproject intended to do to ensure at least an even distribution of benefits.\n7.  The underlyingc auses of exclusions,w  hich in turn cause poverty, are not discussed.\nSuch an analysisi s essentialt o determinew  hether a projecta  ddresseso r actually can address\nthe causes of social exclusion, and whether any of them are likely to impede the project's\nlikelihoodt o reacht he poor.\n8.  The  lack of baseline information is corroborated by rather general  requirements for\nmonitoring and evaluation, normally not specifying benefit indicators or the  need to collect,\nprocess, and analyze data by income level.\n9.

Impact  Evaluation  Study  of  the  Role  of  Nongovernment  Organizations  and\n- -  ---  -  -\nCommunity-Based  Organizations  in ADB Projects\n10.  ADB has made significant progress over the past decade in fulfilling its commitment in\nthe  nongovernment  organization  (NGO)  policy  and  other  operational  strategy  papers  to\nincreasingly  involve  NGOs  and  community-based organizations  (CBOs)  as  partners  in  its\ndevelopment assistance programs. However, the evidence at the country and project levels is\nmixed. NGO/CBO involvement varies significantly in its range, quality I and effectiveness.\n11.  Evidence exists that the use of NGO/CBOs improves the effectiveness of projects where\nbeneficiary consultation and participation are important  NGO/CBOs are often perceived as a\nlow cost option, but the absence of reliable monitoring data makes it difficult to assess the\ncomparative cost-effectiveness of NGOs/CBOs and alternatives. In general, effectiveness may\nbe  more  important than  cost-effectiveness  in  the  types  of  projects that  NGOs/CBOs  are\nnormally involved in.\n12.  As NGO/CBO involvement in ADB business has expanded exponentially over the past\ndecade, the: study found that ADB capacity to deliver on NGOICBO involvement has not kept\npace with overall ADB policy commitments and project demands.\nD.

It is unrealistic  to  expect  that  capacity  building  could  quickly  enhance  the  absorptive\ncapacity  of a transition  economy.  There  is as much  need  to tailor  ADB's  business  processes\nand country  strategies  to the country's  administrative  environment  as there  is for TAs to help the\ncountry  to strengthen  its capacity.", "9 Appendix  2, page 3\n15.
