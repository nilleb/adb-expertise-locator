INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support the Greater \nMekong Railway Association (GMRA)1 in accelerating the development of rail connections among \n0F\nthe Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) countries2 by (i) improving the organizational structure of \n1F\nthe GMRA; (ii) preparing an operational readiness plan to ensure appropriate standards for \ntechnology on safety, productivity, and environmental quality of railway operations; (iii) updating \nthe  GMS  railway  strategy  for  the  development  of  missing  cross-border  railway  links  and \nassociated domestic connections; (iv) updating the Mekong (Sub-) Regional Transport Model \n(MRTM) prepared under phase 1 of the TA for Connecting the Railways of the Greater Mekong \nSubregion, enhancing the capacity to utilize it effectively;3 and (v) identifying bankable railway \n2F\nprojects in GMS countries.4 \n3F\n \n2.  The TA is not included in any current country operations business plan or regional country \noperations business plan, any Asian Development Bank (ADB) Management-approved annual \nwork program of the Southeast Asia Department or a sector or thematic group, or any endorsed \ncorporate priority. The TA was discussed and agreed with the GMS countries during the third \nGMRA board of directors\u2019 meeting in Vientiane, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) on \n22 March 2018. GMS countries expressed strong support for the TA and appreciation of the \ncontinued support of ADB to the GMS program. Further discussion on the implementation of the \nTA was held during the GMRA negotiation meeting on 24 May 2019 at ADB headquarters.5  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  While all GMS countries are well connected by a road network and are signatories of the \nTrans-Asian Railway agreement,6 they still lack connectivity by rail.7 They have weak and older \n4F 5F\nrailway  systems  with  missing  cross-border  links,  delayed  provision  of  cross-border  railway \ninfrastructure, and inadequate regional rail agreements. To enhance railway connectivity in the \nGMS, the GMS countries have identified and agreed upon nine missing cross-border rail links. \nThe GMRA agreed on and endorsed these nine rail links at its first general meeting on 12 March \n2015 in Kunming, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Phase 1 identified priorities for development \nof the missing rail links and preliminary indications of the optimum sequencing for the physical \ndevelopment of the future railway network (footnote 3). It also identified the need to develop the \nfuture railway network in consideration of the current developments in railway technology already \ncommon in the PRC and many other countries; and emerging developments in train control, train \n \n1  The GMRA is a Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) railway coordination body that was established to support physical \nconnectivity and service interoperability. \n2  The GMS countries are Cambodia; the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR); Myanmar; the People's \nRepublic of China (PRC, specifically Yunnan Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region); Thailand; and \nViet Nam. \n3  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2016. Technical Assistance for Connecting the Railways of the Greater Mekong \nSubregion. Manila (TA 9123-REG). Its final report was prepared in September 2018. The draft findings and \nrecommendations were presented in Vientiane, Lao PDR, at the GMRA Board of Directors\u2019 General Meeting held on \n22 March 2018; they were accepted without modification. The TA completion report was published in June 2019 \n(https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/42518/42518-024-tcr-en.pdf).  \n4  ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance Completion Report: Planning the GMS Railway Coordination Office. Manila. \n5  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 December 2019. \n6  The Trans-Asian Railway agreement was signed on 10 November 2006, facilitated by the United Nations Economic \nand Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific. \n7  In the GMS, only Thailand\u2013Cambodia (Poipet\u2013Border Bridge\u2013Aranyaprathet) and Thailand\u2013Lao PDR (Nong Khai\u2013\nFriendship Bridge\u2013Thanaleng) were linked by railways as of July 2019. The Kunming\u2013Hai Phong railway corridor \n(connecting the PRC and Viet Nam) is operational, except for a missing link at the border, where a gauge change is \nrequired. \n \n ", "2 \n \noperations, motive power, and communications. Although phase 1 made good progress with the \nprioritization of the missing railway links, it is essential to (i) define the emerging changes in \nrailway technologies and their potential impact on GMS railway operations and investment, (ii) \nconduct further detailed analysis of what is appropriate given the legacy investment in railway \ninfrastructure,  and  (iii)  continue  consultation  with  national  railway  organizations  that  have \ninadequate cross-border railway transport capabilities. \n \n4.  The GMRA was established in 2012 to promote the development of a seamless GMS rail \nnetwork by (i) agreeing on technical standards of interoperability, and (ii) streamlining and \nharmonizing procedures for cross-border movement of goods and people. However, the GMRA\u2019s \ncurrent structure is not ideal to address future coordination of GMS railway development, and the \nintroduction and standardization of technologies.8 Since its inception, the GMRA has made efforts \n6F\nto better define and formalize its role, and to determine how best to fund its operations. Given \nrecent developments in the GMS, including the construction and planning of several new cross-\nborder railway links, enhancing the technical capability and coordination function of the GMRA \nwould be beneficial to all GMS countries. An institutionally strengthened GMRA would, among \nother things, be able to accommodate appropriate technologies, which would lead to increased \nsafety and railway productivity, and reduced adverse environmental impacts. \n \n5.  The GMRA seeks to accelerate railway connectivity by promoting efficient, safe, reliable, \nand environmentally sustainable rail transport of goods and people within and beyond the GMS. \nADB\u2019s TA for Support for Implementing the Action Plan for Transport and Trade Facilitation in the \nGreater Mekong Subregion helped to prepare and finalize the Framework Agreement on Cross-\nBorder Railway Transport Connectivity in the GMS.9 The Framework Agreement was discussed \n7F\namong GMS countries on 24 May 2019 at ADB headquarters and will subsequently be subject to \nfurther negotiation and the national ratification processes of the GMS countries. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: greater railway connectivity in the GMS \nprovided.10 The TA will have the following outcome: GMRA functioning with adequate capacity \n8F\nand funding.11 \n9F\n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Organizational structure of the Greater Mekong Railway Association \nimproved. A more formal structure with a clear mission, staffing, and business plan is essential. \nRecognizing the complexity in establishing the GMRA (with the involvement of GMS countries), \n \n8  The proposal to establish the GMRA was ratified at the 18th GMS Ministerial Meeting in Nanning, PRC on 12\u201313 \nDecember 2012. ADB has served as the secretariat of the GMRA since its inception. The GMRA board of directors \ncomprises six GMS member countries, with ADB as a member; ADB has been arranging funding for the GMRA as \nrequested by the GMS countries. \n9  ADB. 2014. Technical Assistance for Support for Implementing the Action Plan for Transport and Trade Facilitation \nin the Greater Mekong Subregion. Manila (TA 8748-REG). On 26 October 2018, a draft Cross-Border Railway \nTransport Connectivity Agreement was agreed on among the GMS countries in Bangkok; a revised draft Cross-\nBorder Railway Transport Connectivity Agreement was sent to them on 21 January 2019 for their review and \ncomments. \n10 ADB. 2011. The Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework, 2012\u20132022. \nManila. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n ", "3 \nthe TA will undertake the following tasks, working in close consultation with the relevant GMRA \nworking groups and railway representatives: (i) confirm the structure and improvement plan for \nthe GMRA and draft charter based on the recommendations of ADB\u2019s TA for Planning the Greater \nMekong Subregion Railway Coordination Office in 2013 and as endorsed by the GMS countries \nin 2015; 12 (ii) develop draft governance principles, structure, and staffing needs for the GMRA \n10F\nthat will be discussed at a workshop with GMRA members  and subsequently refined in response \nto comments; (iii) develop a draft 3-year indicative costed business plan and proposed position \ndescriptions for key staff to be discussed at a workshop, and subsequently refined in response to \ncomments; and (iv) canvass options for the GMRA secretariat\u2019s location and for funding the \nGMRA\u2019s new secretariat and the initial period of the business plan. \n \n8.  While the TA cannot ensure that the preferred organizational structure of the GMRA is \nimplemented and properly resourced, it will help improve the quality and timeliness of decision-\nmaking by the current GMRA board by providing quality analysis and close consultation. \n \n9.  Output 2: Operational readiness plan for the Greater Mekong Railway Association \ndeveloped. The TA will assist the GMRA, relevant working groups, and representatives of the \nnational railway organizations to follow a structured process leading to the preparation of an \noperational readiness plan agreed to by all GMS countries that will underpin the development of \nthe future modern GMS railway network. The operational readiness plan will address setting a \ntimetable for (i) the introduction of modern railway technologies and standards, (ii) mainstreaming \nof sustainable railway infrastructure, (iii) the adoption of efficient railway operating practices, and \n(iv) the development of regional railway safety standards. The plan will also consider incorporating \nmitigation methods for addressing the environmental and social risks of railway link development. \nWhile the key issues for such a plan were identified by phase 1 of ADB\u2019s TA for Connecting the \nRailways of the Greater Mekong Subregion (footnote 3), there needs to be a consensus by the \nnational railway organizations on the implementation schedule and resourcing implications. \n \n10.  The TA will undertake to (i) confirm the scope of standards and technologies to be covered \nby the operational readiness plan based on the findings of phase 1 of ADB\u2019s TA for Connecting \nthe Railways of the Greater Mekong Subregion (footnote 3) at a  workshop with GMRA members; \n(ii) develop agreed principles for the introduction of standards and technologies recognizing the \nlarge legacy investments in national railway systems, noting that new railway corridors will use \nmore advanced standards and technologies; (iii) collaboratively develop the framework for the \noperational readiness plan during the workshop; (iv) detail the (draft) operational readiness plan \nand cost it out based on the workshop; and (v) prepare the operational readiness plan based on \ncomments from the GMRA and national railway organizations. \n \n11.  Output  3:  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  railway  network  development  strategy \nupdated. The TA will update the current GMS railway strategy that was formulated in 2010 \n(footnote 12). While the current GMS railway strategy has been effective, it needs updating so \nthat network planning is in line with current national and regional development strategies, and so \nthat it takes account of recent developments with respect to the missing GMS railway links and \nthe identified priorities for future railway link development. \n \n12.  The TA will (i) update project priorities using economic and financial analysis based on \nupdated demand projections (output 4) and costings, reflecting recommendations on standards \nand technology (output 2); (ii) update environmental and social screening of the priority projects; \n \n12 ADB. 2010. Technical Assistance for Planning the Greater Mekong Subregion Railway Coordination Office. Manila \n(TA 7678-REG). The TA assisted GMS countries in preparing a detailed plan for setting up the GMS Railway \nCoordination Office, including a business and a financing plan for its first 5 years of operation. \n ", "4 \n \n(iii) conduct workshops on the findings of the priority projects to conceptualize an updated GMS \nrailway development strategy; and (iv) update the costing and assessment of regional economic \nbenefits. \n \n13.  Output 4: Updated Greater Mekong Subregion transport demand model prepared. \nThe MRTM will provide traffic projections, which will form the foundation for economic and \nfinancial  analysis  to  aid  prioritization  and  inform  implementation  options.  Updated  demand \nprojections are needed to support the development of the GMS railway network development \nstrategy (output 3). The GMRA shall be the custodian of the MRTM and enable it to be used for \nmore detailed project analysis. The following activities will be undertaken under the TA: (i) source \ndata on freight and vehicle movements in relevant GMS corridors; (ii) improve the calibration of \nthe MRTM; (iii) prepare new demand projections for various rail network options to support \ndevelopment of the new GMS railway network development strategy; (iv) document procedures \nfor further data collection and processing, and updating of the MRTM; and (v) train GMRA and \nnational railway organization staff in use of the demand model. \n \n14.  Output  5:  Bankable  railway  projects  identified  in  Greater  Mekong  Subregion \ncountries. The TA will assist GMS countries to formulate bankable investment projects. It will \nhelp to conduct pre-feasibility studies and support the prioritization and initial conceptualization of \ninvestments. This will allow ADB and other GMS countries to scope out their potential support \nprior to full-fledged project preparation. \n \n15.  The TA will (i) update feedback on economic and financial analysis, using the new demand \nprojections and new priorities identified under outputs 3 and 4; (ii) request GMS countries for \nproject suggestions to be nominated for quick screening and/or inclusion in a pre-feasibility study; \n(iii) undertake pre-feasibility studies for the suggested projects; and (iv) identify projects for ADB \nfinancing and transaction TA planning. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the \nPeople's Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation Fund and administered \nby ADB.13 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n11F\n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA. ADB will coordinate closely with the GMS \nmember countries, national railway organizations, and the GMRA board of directors on all aspects \nof implementation of the TA. The GMRA\u2019s working group on partnerships and GMRA operations \nwill serve as the TA steering committee to support close coordination of national plans and \npriorities. The TA will be implemented over 24 months from January 2020 to December 2021. \n \n18.  ADB will manage the TA, with stakeholder oversight provided through the national rail \norganizations, each GMS country\u2019s relevant agencies, and the GMRA. The TA findings will be \ndisseminated to each GMS country through seminars and workshops, as well as to the GMRA \nworking  group  meetings  and  general  meeting.  The  recommendations  on  the  preferred \norganizational structure, internal organizational development plan, and related aspects will be \nmade to the GMRA board of directors through the fourth GMRA board of directors meeting \n(scheduled to take place in September 2020).
