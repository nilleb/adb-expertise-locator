INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Government of Tajikistan has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to strengthen institutional capacity for environmental management. \nThe TA was included in the country strategy and program update for 2003.1 An ADB fact-finding \nmission visited Tajikistan in September 2003 and held discussions with officials of the Ministry \nof  Nature  Protection  (MNP).  During  the  discussions,  the  TA\u2019s  objectives,  scope,  terms  of \nreference of consultants, cost estimates, and implementation arrangements were confirmed. \nThe  mission  also  had  discussions  with  representatives  of  nongovernment  organizations \n(NGOs), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP), and World Bank. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Tajikistan\u2019s unique natural endowment includes Central Asia\u2019s largest water resources \nand abundant sunshine, which contributes significantly to the economy, especially agriculture \nand  hydropower  generation.  However,  development  is  accompanied  by  environmental \nchallenges\u2014natural resources degradation, especially increasing levels of waterlogging; soil \nerosion and salinity; loss of biodiversity; and water-related calamities such as mudflows and \nfloods. Much of these are due to inadequate public policies and weak institutions that failed to \nprovide incentives, adjust markets, change behaviors, and mobilize resources to protect the \nenvironment. \n \n3.  Inadequate policies and institutional weakness constrain environmental management. \nThe Government inherited the former Soviet Union\u2019s administrative system, which had limited \ncoordination among line ministries, and the organizational culture built on narrow scientific \nspecialization. As a task that cuts across sectoral responsibilities, environmental management \nrequires  environmental  considerations  to  be  integrated  into  policy  formulation,  with  new \ndevelopment concepts that take account of externalities, multiple potential benefits of natural \nresources, and views of different stakeholders. Environmental management requires strong \ndirection  from,  and  coordination  among,  government  agencies,  which,  in  turn,  require \ninstitutional development to improve environmental strategic planning, policy formulation, and \ncoordination.  Given  the  Government\u2019s  limited  experience  in  coordinating  complex \nenvironmental  policies,  and  a  shortage  of  strategic  vision  and  holistic  understanding  of \nenvironmental management, that institutional mechanisms to formulate environmental policies \nand safeguards are not up to the challenge is not surprising.  \n \n4.  According to the Law on Nature Protection, MNP is the main organization responsible \nfor  developing  and  implementing  national  environmental  policies  and  legislation.2  MNP\u2019s \nstructure does not include a specific unit that could help the Government systematically develop \npolicies and plans for sustainable development. Strategies and plans appear to be generated \nad hoc within various MNP units, through sectoral committees and commissions outside MNP, \nor under international environmental conventions supported by various external agencies. Such \ncommittees and units include the State Commission for Sustainable Development under the \nPrime  Minister\u2019s  Office,  Working  Group  for  Combating  Desertification  under  the  State \nCommittee  for  Land  Management,  and  Biodiversity  Center  and  State  Hydrometeorological \n                                                 \n1\n The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet Edition) on 14 May 2003. \n2\n Through TA 3614-TAJ: Capacity Building for Environmental Assessment and Monitoring, ADB has been assisting \nMNP to strengthen its capacity for environmental management. Further information on the roles and institutional \nstructure of MNP can be found in the consultants\u2019 final report. ", "2 \nService  under  MNP.  Activities  of  these  units/commissions  are  often  uncoordinated  and \ninsufficiently synchronized with donor support and regional initiatives.  \n \n5.  Horizontal communication and cooperation between MNP and other ministries/agencies \nas well as across units within MNP occur infrequently, and are generally ineffective, hampering \nMNP\u2019s efforts to direct environmental management. The ministries/agencies responsible for \nmainstreaming  economic  activities  often  place  a  lower  priority  on  long-term  environmental \nconcerns than on immediate concerns of economic output. MNP has been unable to \u201cengage\u201d \nthese ministries and agencies fully within an agreed-on policy framework integrating economics \nwith  environmental  concerns.  The  basic  policy  documents  such  as  the  State  Ecological \nProgram for 1998\u20132008 are statements of objectives rather than argued policy and financing \nmeasures to reach the objectives. A consequence is that a considerable number of donor-\nfunded activities do not conform to a clear strategy. The national environmental action plan \n(NEAP), being prepared with the support of the World Bank and UNDP and expected to be \ncompleted in 2004,3 may well spell out the suggested approach. A working group established in \nMNP  is  coordinating  NEAP\u2019s  development.  A  common  concern  reflecting  the  experience \nelsewhere in Central Asia is that NEAP\u2019s financial and economic aspects might be poorly \ndeveloped, given the lack of coordination and involvement of other key government agencies in \npreparing NEAP. \n \n6.  Since environmental management is mainly funded by donors, they should prioritize \nimproved  strategic  planning  and  policy  formulation.  Several  donor-supported  action  plans \n(particularly the national biodiversity action plan, national action plan to combat desertification, \nand  regional environmental action plan) are being developed separately from one another and \nfrom NEAP. Institutional structure, policy formulation, and coordination should be reformed \nurgently. \n \n7.  The state of development of domestic strategic planning and policy-formulation capacity \ncan be in part attributed to MNP\u2019s role and organizational structure. MNP is mainly a monitoring \nand enforcing agency. MNP\u2019s involvement in strategic planning and policymaking is new and, \nnot surprisingly, MNP has turned to the academe for help in these matters. However, with its \npronounced scientific bias, the academe is new to these activities and notably weak in dealing \nwith socioeconomic aspects of environmental management. \n \n8.  Improved environmental and natural resources management is a pillar in ADB\u2019s goal to \nreduce poverty in the Central Asia republics. Providing TA for institutional development and \nimproved strategic planning and coordination for environmental management is also in line with \nADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  for  Tajikistan  (2004\u20132006).  ADB\u2019s  first  advisory  TA \n(footnote 2) to improve environmental management in Tajikistan was completed in June 2003. \nThe initiative recommended restructuring MNP, including establishing a center on strategy, \nplanning, and coordination within MNP. The Government agrees with this assessment and \nrecommendation and is ready to undertake such changes.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n3\n The World Bank has recruited two international consultants to help MNP prepare NEAP. UNDP is proposing to \nhelp the Government finalize NEAP by involving national experts and recruiting domestic consultants. Coordination \namong government agencies and donors in preparing NEAP needs to be strengthened, and other donors should \npromote coordination.  ", "    3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n9.  The  TA\u2019s  objective  is  to  help  the  Government  strengthen  institutional  capacity  for \nenvironmental  strategic  planning,  policy  formulation,  and  coordination  among  government \nagencies and donors involved in environment management. The TA will counter the inertia and \nfragmented responsibility for policy formulation within MNP, and among MNP, key economic \nplanning agencies, and donors. \n \n10.  To meet these objectives, the TA will produce a set of specific outputs and deliverables: \n(i) establish an environmental policy and planning center under MNP with strong capability to \ndevelop and evaluate environmental policies, taking into account externalities and the view of \ndifferent stakeholders; (ii) facilitate finalization of the first NEAP; and (iii) improve coordination \namong  government  agencies  in  environmental  management  and  among  donors  in \nenvironmental assistance.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n11.  The  TA\u2019s  scope  will  cover  four  main  tasks:  (i)  define  the  roles,  functions,  and \nresponsibilities of the center in consultation with all key stakeholders, based on an assessment \nof the most pressing needs; (ii) identify the key institutional, administrative, and coordination \nchallenges brought forth by the center\u2019s establishment; develop a transfer plan detailing the \nprocedure to establish the center in response to the challenges identified; and implement the \nplan; (iii) prioritize the center\u2019s subject areas and tasks, develop a medium-term work plan, and \nstart to implement it; and (iv) promote coordination among key stakeholders by facilitating \nfinalization of NEAP.  \n \n12.  The first task involves development of a conceptual framework spelling out the roles and \nresponsibilities  of  the  center,  which  will  be  built  with  MNP\u2019s  resources  and  expertise,  in \naccordance with the charter and environmental legislation. The roles and responsibilities will be \nclearly  defined  and  widely  understood  through  a  review  and  analysis  of  strengths  and \nweakness of MNP\u2019s organizational structure, institutional mandates, institutional interaction and \ncoordination  with  other  ministries/agencies,  NGOs,  and  external  agencies  in  economic \ndevelopment planning and environmental policy development. The establishment of the center \nitself is not the purpose. Instead, the center will be an element of the overall institutional \nmechanism conceived to more fully integrate environmental considerations into the economic \ndevelopment mainstream.  \n \n13.   The second task is to identify key tasks posed by organizational realignment within \nMNP related to the center\u2019s establishment and its budget, personnel, and information-flow \nimplications. High-level support and links to government bodies other than MNP need to be \nspelled out. A phased transfer plan to establish the center will respond to the issues. The \ntransfer plan will define and itemize the transition measures and procedures, and address \ncapacity building and training. Office equipment and access to environmental information will be \nprovided. A government instrument such as a decree will be issued to support the center\u2019s \nestablishment, and the transfer plan will be implemented during the TA.  \n \n14.  The third task involves development of a 2\u2013year medium-term work plan for the center \nthat  can  be  updated  every  one  or  two  years.  Priority  areas  for  environmental  policy \ndevelopment and coordination mechanism establishment will be identified. Plans to recruit staff, ", "4 \nand policies to encourage staff to remain employed at the center will be formulated. The work \nplan should be developed in consultation and discussion with key stakeholders, within and \noutside MNP.  \n \n15.  The fourth task will be to promote coordination in environmental planning among key \nstakeholders (MNP, other government agencies, NGOs, and donors). Mechanisms to do so will \nbe identified, including a review of the necessity and feasibility of establishing an interministry \ncommittee for sustainable development. NEAP\u2019s finalization will be facilitated. World Bank, \nUNDP,  and  ADB  will  cooperate  to  harmonize  country  environmental  analysis  and  jointly \norganize  NEAP  consultation  meetings  and  workshops.  Decision  makers  from  economic \nplanning agencies will be involved in NEAP review and finalization. The TA will also support \nNEAP\u2019s publication. \n \n16.  Key  staff  of  departments/units  that  formulate  and  implement  environmental  policy \nformulation and implementation within MNP (particularly the State Hydrometeorological Service, \nBiodiversity  Center,  and  Nature  Protection  Research  Laboratory)  will  work  together  to \nrecommend changes in MNP\u2019s institutional structure. A series of meetings within MNP attended \nby staff from all units/departments will discuss key issues relating to the center\u2019s establishment. \nStaff\u2019s comments will be incorporated into the transfer plan and the 2\u2013year medium-term work \nplan.  \n \n17.  A series of national consultation workshops will be held before and after the center\u2019s \nestablishment to reach a common understanding on the center\u2019s role and responsibility and the \ncoordination  mechanisms  for  cooperative  and  collective  work  in  formulating  environmental \npolicies among key stakeholders. Representatives from related government agencies, local \necological committees, NGOs, and donors will participate in the workshops.  \n \n18.  TA  implementation  will  emphasize  the  transfer  of  experience  and  knowledge  from \ninternational consultants to government staff and domestic consultants. MNP and concerned \nofficials will play an important role in issue analysis, and preparation of the transfer plan and \nmedium-term work plan. A study tour to Kazakhstan and the People\u2019s Republic of China will be \norganized to learn from these countries\u2019 experience with integrated environmental policymaking \nand institutional arrangement. Participants will be senior staff of the center and other economic \nplanning agencies that shape environmental policy. A training program focusing on economic \nfoundations  and  instruments  of  environmental  policy,  and  quantification  of  environmental \nimpacts will be prepared and implemented for staff assigned to the center and from related \nagencies.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The cost of the TA is estimated at $265,000 equivalent, consisting of $165,000 in foreign \nexchange and $100,000 equivalent in local currency. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby the Government of Finland and administered by ADB. The Government of Finland will \nfinance $220,000 to cover the entire foreign exchange cost of $165,000 and $55,000 equivalent \nof the local currency cost. The Government of Tajikistan will finance the balance of the local \ncurrency cost of $45,000 equivalent. Detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n20.  MNP will be the TA Executing Agency. Other key government agencies involved in \nenvironmental management (such as the Ecological and Emergency Department under the ", "    5 \nPresidential Executive Board; ministries of finance, agriculture, health, and irrigation and water \nresources; and State  Committee  on Land Management) will be kept fully informed of the \nprocess. A project management office (PMO) will be established in MNP tasked with day-to-day \noperations of the TA. MNP\u2019s first deputy minister will be the overall project coordinator, in \ncharge  also  of  interagency  liaison.  Two  senior  MNP  officials  to  be  closely  involved  in \nestablishing the Center will serve as key PMO members. They will organize meetings in MNP \nrelating  to  the  work  of  the  center  and  day-to-day  communications  in  operational  matters \ninvolving  ADB,  consultants,  donors,  and  other  related  government  agencies.  Assisted  by \nconsultants, the officials will develop the transfer plan and draft the center\u2019s medium-term work \nplan. The consultants\u2019 team leader (international) and deputy team leader (domestic) will act as \nthe PMO\u2019s special advisers. The deputy team leader will attend all TA-related meetings based \non MNP\u2019s administrative procedures.  \n \n21.  Two international consultants will be recruited on an individual basis. TA implementation \nwill require 4 person-months of international and 12 person-months of domestic consultants. \nThe consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The international consultants will have substantial experience in (i) environmental \neconomics and policy, and (ii) environmental institution and training. Completion of the TA will \ntake 16 months, from January 2004 to April 2005.  \n \n22.  The consultants will help MNP analyze the underlying causes for establishing the center, \nidentify the key issues and challenges for organizational change, introduce best practices of \ninstitutional  development  for  environmental  management  in  other  countries,  formulate  the \nconceptual  framework  with  well-defined  and  widely  understood  roles  and  responsibilities, \nprepare the plan of institutional realignment and the medium-term work plan, and coordinate \nwith other donors and NGOs. The consultants will help MNP start implementing the plans, \norganize consultation workshops and the study tour, and design and implement the detailed \ntraining program for MNP staff assigned to work at the center. The continuity of consultants\u2019 \nwork through out the TA is important, and will be ensured particularly through the deputy team \nleader\u2019s services. The terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $220,000 to the Government \nof Tajikistan to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Finland for Institutional \nDevelopment for Improved Environmental Strategic Planning and Policy, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board.

A  team  of  two  international  and  several  local  consultants  will  be  recruited.  The \ninternational  consultants\u2019  input  will  be  an  estimated  4  person-months  of  expertise  in \nenvironmental economics, policy, institutions, and training. The domestic consultants\u2019 input will \nbe  an  estimated  12  person-months  of  expertise  in  environmental  policy,  management, \neconomics, science, and training. An international consultant will serve as team leader, and a \ndomestic consultant, as deputy. The international and domestic consultants will work closely \ntogether to implement the technical assistance (TA). All consultants will be recruited on an \nindividual basis.  \n \nI.  Tasks \n \n  1.  International Consultants \n \n2.  The international consultants will work together using a flexible approach to allow them \nto provide their services at the best times. The consultants will do the following: \n \n(i)  Select the domestic consultants jointly with the Ministry of Nature Protection \n(MNP)1 and, in consultation with Asian Development Bank (ADB), prepare terms \nof reference and assign tasks. \n \n(ii)  Help  MNP  identify  key  stakeholders  for  consultation  and  participation  in \nestablishing  the  center,  and  engage  them  in  TA  implementation.
