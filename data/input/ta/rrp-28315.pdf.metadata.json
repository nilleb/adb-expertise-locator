The  inadequate  water  supply  and  sanitation\nsystems in these towns have adversely affected the quality of\nlife and health conditions of the people living in them.\nThe  five  provincial  towns  are  selected  from  among  seven\nremaining  provincial  towns  that  have  not  received  any\nexternal  assistance  in  water  supply  and  sanitation.  Two\ndistrict towns from two relatively poor provinces are included\nto balance the support to economic growth and the need to\nreach the poor. Access to safe water supply among these\ntowns ranges from 18-55 percent among the provincial towns,\nand  from  4-9  percent  among  the  district  towns.  Similarly,\nseptic tank coverage among the provincial towns ranges from\n44-86 percent, and that among the district towns from 6-20\npercent. Lack of access to safe water supply and sanitation\nfacilities, combined with poor drainage systems, caused great\nhealth risks to the residents, especially the poor, who often\nlive in flood-prone areas.\nObjectives and Scope The Project will improve water supply and sanitation systems\nin five provinces with total service area populations of about\n1.2 million by 2010. The objectives are to (i) improve the\nhealth and quality of life of the people living in the project\ntowns by constructing water supply, drainage, and sanitation\nfacilities,  and  providing  health  and  hygiene  education;  (ii)\nsupport  community  participation  by  developing  community-\nbased sanitation credit schemes for sanitation improvement;\nand (iii) improve the financial sustainability of the water supply\ncompanies (WSCs). The Project comprises four components:\nCommunity Environmental Sanitation Improvement. This\nincludes  the  public  health  awareness  program,  and\ncommunity environmental sanitation improvement. The first\nprogram aims at improving the communities\u2019 awareness of", "iii\nthe relationships between water, sanitation, and health, and\nmotivating households to connect to piped water supply and\nconvert  to  pour  flush  toilets  with  septic  tanks;  the  second\nprograms  focus  on  small-scale  environmental  sanitation\nimprovements  not  covered  by  the  main  construction\ncontracts, and to meet demand for improvements generated\narising from the first program.\nWater Supply. This part will upgrade/expand water intakes,\nraw  water  transmission,  water  treatment  plants,  and\ndistribution  networks  in  the  Project  towns  to  meet  the\nprojected demand of 212,000 cubic meters (m3) per day in the\nservice areas by 2010.\nDrainage  and  Sanitation.  This  part  includes  rehabilitation\nand cleaning of about 22 kilometers (km) of existing drains,\nand construction of 69 km of secondary and tertiary drains in\nthe towns, and about 20,000 septic tanks in households and\npublic areas.\nImplementation Assistance and Capacity Building. This\npart  includes  (i)  project  orientation  assistance,  (ii)  project\nimplementation  assistance,  and  (iii)  capacity  building  for\nWSCs.\nCost Estimates The total project cost is estimated at $98.0 million equivalent,\nof which $50.4 million (51.4 percent) is the foreign exchange\ncost,  including  $1.1  million  in  interest  charges  during\nconstruction, and $47.6 million equivalent (48.6 percent) is\nthe local currency cost, including duties and taxes of about\n$5.6 million.\nFinancing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total Percent\nSource Exchange Currency Cost\nAsian Development Bank 41.4 18.6 60.0 61.2\nAgence Francaise de Developpement 6.6 4.4 11.0 11.2\nProvincial governments 0.0 23.5 23.5 24.0\nBeneficiaries 2.4 1.1 3.5 3.6\nTotal 50.4 47.6 98.0 100.0\nPercent 51.4 48.6 100.0\nLoan Amount and Terms The equivalent of SDR46,945,000.00 ($60.0 million) will be\nprovided in various currencies from Special Funds resources\nof the Asian Development Bank (ADB), for a term of 32 years,\nincluding a grace period of 8 years, and with an interest rate\nof 1.0 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent per annum thereafter.\nPeriod of Utilization Until 30 June 2008", "iv\nExecuting Agencies Each  provincial  people\u2019s  committee  will  be  the  executing\nagency (EA) in the province.\nImplementation The  EA  in  each  province  will  set  up  a  provincial  steering\nArrangements committee (PSC), which, on behalf of the provincial people's\ncommittee  (PPC),  will  have  the  overall  responsibilities  for\nproject  implementation.

THE PROPOSAL\n1. I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed\nloan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Third Provincial Towns Water Supply and\nSanitation Project.\nII.  INTRODUCTION\n2. In recognition of the adverse impact of inadequate safe drinking water supply and poor\nsanitation conditions on human development in the urban centers, the Government asked the\nAsian Development Bank (ADB) for assistance in preparing an investment project covering\nwater supply and sanitation in five provinces. In December 1999, ADB approved technical\nassistance (TA)1 for the preparation of the Third Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation\nProject. ADB missions2 visited Viet Nam since the commencement of the TA in May 2000,\nreviewed  the  project  feasibility  study  prepared  by  TA  consultants,  and  reached  an\nunderstanding  with  the  Government  on  the  scope,  cost  estimates,  and  financing  and\nimplementation arrangements of the proposed Project. This report is based on the findings of\nADB missions, reports prepared by the TA consultants and other aid agencies, and discussions\nwith central and provincial government agencies and international and bilateral aid agencies.\nThe project framework is presented in Appendix 1.\nIII.  BACKGROUND\nA.  Sector Description\n1.  Overview\n3. Viet Nam is the 12th most populous country in the world, with a total population of 76.3\nmillion in 1999, of which about 23 percent live in urban areas. The population is concentrated in\ntwo large river deltas. The Mekong River Delta is the most populous region, with 16.1 million\npeople, or 21 percent of the total, followed by the Red River Delta, where Hanoi is located, with\na population of 14.8 million or 19 percent of the total. The population grew at an average annual\ngrowth rate of 1.7 percent during 1989-1999. The regional distribution of population varies from\n62 and 67 people per square kilometer (km2) in mountainous provinces in the north and the\ncentral highlands, respectively, to 408 and 1,180 people/km2 in the Mekong and the Red River\nDeltas, respectively, and 2,883 and 2,410 people/km2 in the major urban cities of Hanoi and Ho\nChi Minh City (HCMC), respectively. The majority (86 percent) of people are of Kinh ethnicity,\nwith the remaining 14 percent representing some 53 minority ethnic groups including Cham,\nKhmer, Muong, and Thai. The main ethnic groups in the south (particularly Mekong Delta\nregion) are Cham and Khmer.\n4. Viet  Nam\u2019s  health  indicators  compare  favorably  with  those  of  other  countries  at  a\ncomparable level of income. The average life expectancy is 67 years: 65 years for men and 70\n                  \n1  TA 3323-VIE: Third Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation, for $1 million, approved on 3 December 1999.\n2  The Appraisal Mission comprised X. Ye, Senior Financial Analyst and Mission Leader, C. Wee, Senior Counsel, S.\nPrice, Senior Social Development Specialist, S. Bando, Programs Officer; A. Perdiguero, Project Economist; L. D.\nThang, Project Implementation Officer (VRM); and P. Cooper, Water Supply Engineer and Staff Consultant. The\nAgence Francaise de Developpement staff of P. Lecrinier, Charge de Mission, J. Pecresse, Vietnam Country\nOfficer, and Y. Bensaid, Engineer, also joined the Appraisal Mission.", "2\nyears for women. Maternal mortality is officially3 100 per 100,000 live births with infant mortality\nat 37 per 1,000 live births. Disparities exist between geographical regions, with the central\nhighlands and northern mountainous regions having an infant mortality rate of 56 per 1,000 live\nbirths. Child malnutrition is very high at 39 percent as a result of poor nutritional intake, food\nshortages, and diarrhea caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation. Approximately 47 percent\nof the urban population and less than 20 percent of the rural population have access to safe\nwater supply, and only 43 percent and 15 percent respectively have access to safe excreta\ndisposal. Even those with access to the facilities may not use them properly and hygienically.\nCommon diseases include tuberculosis, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, and malaria. The\nmain causes of infant mortality are birth asphyxia, birth trauma, neonatal tetanus, pneumonia,\ncongenital diseases, acute respiratory infections, and malaria.\n5. Vietnam\u2019s per capita GDP is estimated at $401 for 2000. While the poverty ratios in the\ncountry vary substantially, depending on the methodologies used by various measuring agencies,\npoverty has been declining significantly over the past decade. The estimated poverty ratios in the\nproject towns are: 13.4 percent for Rach Gia, 9.2 percent for Tay Ninh, 7.5 percent for Thu Dau\nMot, 10.4 percent for Tuy Hoa, 20.7 percent for Chi Thanh, 7.9 percent for La Hai, and 27.0\npercent for Phan Rang. The measurement of poverty based on a poverty line has its limit,\nbecause it does not take into account other dimensions of poverty, such as access to basic\nservices.\n6. In  1999,  the  labor  force  was  estimated  at  37.8  million,  of  which  68  percent  were\nemployed in agriculture, 13 percent in industry and construction, and 19 percent in the service\nsector. The urban unemployment rate was 6.7 percent in 1999, compared with 26.8 percent in\nthe rural areas. With a high ratio of farmers to arable land, and about 1 million laborers entering\nthe labor market every year, underemployment is common and is estimated as high as 57\npercent in rural areas. The excessive rural labor force relative to available productive assets in\nthe rural sector has led to a rapid rural-urban migration, which places increasing pressure on the\nurban infrastructure, causing deterioration of urban environment, exacerbation of urban poverty,\nand worsening of urban unemployment.\n2.  Classification of Urban Centers\n7. The urban population increased by about 5.5 million people during 1989-1999, with an\naverage annual increase of 3.6 percent. By 1999, the urban population reached 18 million and\naccounted for 24 percent of the total population, compared with 19.4 percent in 1989. The\nGovernment estimates that the rate of urbanization will increase to 45 percent of the population\nby 2020. Urban centers in Viet Nam are divided into six classes (Table 1). Currently there are\nfour centrally governed cities, 61 provincial towns and 537 other urban townships.\n3.  Water Supply\n8. Urban water supply systems are unable to meet the demand of the country\u2019s growing\nurban  population  for  safe  drinking  water.  Estimates  indicate  that  only  around  150  of  the\ncountry\u2019s 600 urban centers have piped water supply systems, which serve some 47 percent of\nthe urban population. Service coverage has risen only slightly since 1990, from an estimated 44\npercent of the urban population. Apart from piped water supply, many urban residents rely on\nuntreated water from shallow wells, rainwater collection, streams, canals, or ponds. These\nsources (except for rainwater) are potentially subject to serious pollution and therefore present a\n                  \n3  The World Health Organization estimates that maternal mortality could be as high as 160/100,000 live births.", "3\nmajor health risk to the urban populations. A significant proportion of the urban population\npurchase water for drinking and cooking from vendors at prices often 5-20 times existing tariffs\nfor public water supply. Average per capita water consumption in the larger urban centers varies\nfrom 50 to 180 liters per capita per day (lpcd). Shortages of water and intermittent supply,\nusually 6-18 hours per day, are common in urban areas, although exact levels are difficult to\nestablish because of poor metering systems.\nTable 1: Classification of Urban Centers\nClass Type Comment\n1 National centers.

The  physical  conditions  of  urban  water  supply  systems  are  generally  poor,  due  to\ninadequate maintenance. Many water treatment plants, even those built recently, suffer from\ndesign and construction faults. Some urban centers have no treatment facilities and raw water is\npumped  directly  to  the  distribution  network,  with  suspended  solids,  iron,  or  high  levels  of\ncontamination. The water supply systems, often patched up or expanded using a variety of\nincompatible  equipment  and  tools  from  local  sources,  are  of  poor  quality.  Water  supply\ncompanies (WSCs) are usually unable to meet the design and construction standards because\nof  lack  of  appropriate  equipment,  high  quality  materials,  management  skills,  and  financial\nresources. Maintenance is inadequate to maintain an appropriate level of service. As a result,\nexisting schemes are often difficult to operate, unreliable, and inefficient. Except for HCMC and\nHanoi, the quality of water supplied in urban areas generally fails to meet the World Health\nOrganization (WHO) standards or requirements of the drinking water quality guidelines of the\nGovernment. Although meters are generally used in urban centers, the quality and accuracy are\nusually poor. Unaccounted for water (UFW) is reported at 32-54 percent of water produced.\n4.  Drainage and Sanitation\n10. The urban centers commonly discharge wastewater and storm water through combined\nsystems to nearby watercourses, usually without treatment. Large sections of these combined\nnetworks, constructed decades ago, need rehabilitation due to lack of maintenance. Flooding is", "4\ncommon in urban centers in the wake of heavy rainfalls. Silted or inadequate drains overflow\nduring storms, spreading excreta and garbage over the ground. Many drains were constructed\nwithout adequate grades for self-cleansing and there are often no design provisions for odor\ncontrol or dry weather flow. There are few wastewater treatment plants, and untreated sewage\nand  industrial  wastewater  are  discharged  directly  into  water  bodies  and  streams  in  the\nsurrounding areas and pose high risks to aquatic ecosystems.\n11. Environmentally acceptable sanitation facilities in urban areas are generally unavailable.\nWhile around 40 percent of households in provincial towns have septic tanks, only a small\nportion of these septic tanks is connected to sewers or drains. In many urban areas, septic tank\neffluent or seepage contaminates the groundwater table in areas where water from wells is\nwidely used for drinking. In general, households in district towns have fewer septic tanks than\nthose in provincial towns, and some even lack basic toilet facilities. Those without access to any\nsanitation facilities have no organized system of wastewater collection, treatment, and disposal,\nand use open ground, local drains, and watercourses for disposal of excreta and wastewater.\n12. Although most provincial and district towns have some form of solid waste facilities, the\ncoverage is low, with only 47 percent collection. As a result, solid waste usually is burned or\ndumped into lakes, ponds, streets, vacant land or in drainage systems. Most solid waste comes\nfrom domestic activities, with only 30 percent generated by industries. Collected solid waste is\ngenerally brought to landfills. Current disposal sites in urban areas are not properly designed\nand do not operate as landfills but simply as dumpsites. Typically, the landfills are unlined with a\nhigh risk of leakage into groundwater aquifers. No city or town in Viet Nam has adequate\nfacilities  for  disposing  of  hospital  and  toxic  wastes,  although  in  HCMC  ADB\u2019s  current\nEnvironmental Improvement Project4 will address such issues.\n5.  Sector Institutions\n13. Sector responsibilities for urban water supply and sanitation involve both the central and\nprovincial government agencies. The central Government agencies are mainly responsible for\npolicymaking,  standards,  and  development.  Provincial  and  local  governments  are  mainly\nresponsible  for  construction,  supervision,  and  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  of  the\nfacilities,  although  they  are  becoming  more  active  in  development  in  response  to  the\nGovernment\u2019s decentralization initiatives.\n14. Apart from urban water supply and sanitation, the Ministry of Construction (MOC) is\nmainly responsible for (i) urban and rural planning and policies; (ii) construction standards, rules\nand regulations; (iii) technical and financial guidelines for evaluating construction projects; (iv)\nresearch,  and  (v)  human  resource  development  for  urban  infrastructure  investment  and\nmaintenance. MOC also involves in monitoring and administering major urban development\nprojects. MOC has a minister and four vice ministers, and includes 8 departments, 4 centers, 5\ninstitutes, 4 boards, 12 corporations, 20 companies, 2 universities, 5 colleges, and 6 training\nschools.  MOC  established  the  Management  Board  for  Water  Supply  and  Sanitation\nDevelopment  Projects  in  1994  to  manage  externally  assisted  water  supply  and  sanitation\nprojects.\n15. At  the  provincial  level,  provincial  people\u2019s  committees  (PPCs)  exercise  executive\nauthority over all functions. The line ministries have their corresponding departments in the\n                  \n4  Loan No. 1702-VIE: Ho Chi Minh  City Environmental Improvement Project, for $70 million, approved on 7 October \n1999.", "5\nstructure of the provincial government. PPCs make use of boards and committees to facilitate\ncross-sectoral  coordination.  The  administrative  responsibility  for  urban  water  supply  and\nsanitation is usually assigned to the department of construction, which then delegates the\nresponsibility to a WSC, and that for drainage, solid waste, and sanitation to a public works\ncompany (PWC). In some cases, WSCs are responsible for both water supply and sanitation.\nOther key organizations related to the sector include the\n(i)  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment,  which  is  responsible  for  advising  the\nGovernment  on  investment  planning  and  the  utilization  of  externally  funded\nassistance and direct foreign investment;\n(ii)  Ministry of Finance (MOF), which prepares and administers the budget and is\nresponsible for the disbursement of externally funded projects;\n(iii)  Ministry of Science Technology and the Environment, which is responsible for\nenvironmental protection;\n(iv)  Ministry  of  Health,  which  is  responsible  for  promoting  environmental  health\neducation and for water quality testing;\n(v)  Viet  Nam  Women\u2019s  Union  (VWU),  which  is  a  Government-funded  mass\norganization with central, provincial, and district level offices, and plays a major\nrole in community mobilization and health education; and\n(vi)  Viet Nam Water Supply and Sewerage Association, which is a non-government\nbusiness and professional organization established in 1987 with members from\nWSCs and related companies and organizations; and is active in developing and\nundertaking training courses for WSCs.\nB.  Government Policies and Plans\n16. The Government\u2019s development framework and priorities are reflected in a series of\ndevelopment plans, policy statements, and ministerial decisions. For urban rehabilitation and\ndevelopment programs, the Government policy5 emphasizes the need for reducing the gaps\nbetween  urban  and  rural  areas  and  developing  and  modernizing  technical  and  social\ninfrastructure to attract investment and improve people\u2019s living standards. The development\ntargets and policies for urban water supply and sanitation are reflected in the Government\u2019s\nOrientation Plan for Development of Urban Water Supply to 2020, and the Draft Orientation\nPlan for Urban Drainage Development to 2020. For water supply, the targets by 2010 are (i) 100\npercent coverage and 180 lpcd in Class 1 cities; (ii) 95 percent coverage and 150 lpcd in Class\n2 cities; (iii) 90 percent coverage and 120 lpcd in Class 3,4, and 5 towns; and (iv) 80 percent\ncoverage and 80-100 lpcd in district towns and clusters. The targets for drainage, sewerage,\nand  urban  environmental  sanitation  are  to  (i)  improve  and  complete  urban  drainage  and\nsewerage  systems  to  ensure  a  minimum  of  80-90  percent  coverage  by  2020;  (ii)  require\nenterprises to have on-site treatment for toxic liquid waste; (iii) eliminate pit latrines in urban\nareas by 2005; (iv) provide waste collection systems that treat solid and liquid wastes; and (v)\ngradually rehabilitate and clean the canal systems.\n17. To achieve these development targets, the Government emphasizes the importance of\ninstitutional reforms in the development of efficient and sustainable water and sanitation sectors.\nSpecifically,  the  orientation  plans  call  for  (i)  restructuring  MOC  to  refocus  its  functions  in\n                  \n5  The Prime Minister\u2019s Decision on Urban Master Planning Guidelines up to 2020, 23 January 1998.", "6\ndevelopment planning, sector policy formulation, regulations, training, and technology transfer,\nand terminating its direct involvement in business activities; (ii) clearly defining the roles and\nresponsibilities of various Government agencies involved in the water and sanitation sector and\nencouraging better cooperation among these sector agencies; (iii) making PPCs the responsible\nagencies for water supply, sanitation, and drainage development in the provinces; (iv) providing\nWSCs with training and capacity building on project implementation and O&M, and encouraging\nWSCs to become self-financing and  progressively eliminate subsidies; (v) creating the legal\nbasis for providing public urban services, with enhanced enforcement; (vi) promoting community\neducation  and  awareness,  particularly  on  drainage  and  sanitation  issues;  (vii)  mobilizing\nadditional financial resources; (viii) protecting water sources; (ix) upgrading technology and\nmaterials; and (x) developing human resources.\n18. Reforms in the water supply sector were initiated in 1990 with the promulgation of\nResolution  217,  which  delegated  the  authority  for  setting  water  tariffs  from  the  central\nGovernment Pricing Committee to PPCs. It also reduced Government grants to small WSCs\nand eliminated such grants to large ones. Wider range reforms in the state-owned enterprises\n(SOE) were introduced in 1995 with the enactment of the Law on State Enterprises (LSE). The\nmajor objective of the LSE is to improve performance of SOEs. Apart from strengthening the\nrole of PPCs in overseeing the operations of the SOEs, the LSE allows SOEs to retain all\ndepreciation expenses instead of submitting them to the Government. This is of particular\nimportance to WSCs. Under the LSE, WSCs have been designated as state public service\nenterprises, which are defined as SOEs that produce, distribute, and supply public services in\naccordance with state social policies. In general, the financial and managerial autonomy of the\nstate  public  service  enterprises  is  limited.  For  example,  tariffs  must  be  approved  by  the\nsupervising PPC.\n19. Complementing its water sector policies, the Government issued a strategy for the\ndevelopment of urban drainage in November 1998, which aims at reducing subsidies to the\nsector in the short term, and establishing financial mechanisms to ensure sustainability of urban\ndrainage enterprises in the long term. While the policy objective is to reduce Government\nsubsidies by collecting sufficient drainage tariffs to cover O&M costs and an increasing share of\ncapital investment, the application of the policy in the project towns is still in its very early stage.\nThere  are  presently  no  charges  for  drainage  in  any  of  the  project  towns.  Following  the\nGovernment\u2019s  policy  on  cost  recovery  for  water  supply  and  sanitation,  MOC  and  the\nGovernment Pricing Committee issued guidelines on water supply and drainage tariffs in June\n1999, recommending that the water tariff cover the cost of water production and the resultant\ndrainage, and generate pretax income approved by the PPC. The drainage charge should be no\nlower than 10 percent of the total water production cost. The decision to include a drainage\ncharge in the water tariff provides the means to recover the costs of drainage and wastewater\nmanagement.\n20. Despite the Government\u2019s policies and reform initiatives over the past 10 years to make\nWSCs  legally  distinct  and  financially  autonomous,  the  level  of  autonomy  for  WSCs,  and\nparticularly PWCs, remains limited. Government approval is required for key management and\noperating decisions, such as production level, staff salaries and benefits, capital and major\nmaintenance expenditures, and senior staff appointments. Provincial governments generally set\ntariffs for water supply and sanitation on the basis of the perceived affordability and willingness\nto pay by the households, institutions, and commercial and industrial establishments. The tariffs\nare insufficient for WSCs to recover full cost and provide adequate levels of service. As a result,\nWSCs are unable to expand the services to households unconnected to the piped water supply", "7\nsystems. Poor services in water supply also prevented industrial and commercial development,\nfor which quality and reliability of water supply are far more important than the tariff level.\nC.  External Assistance to the Sector\n21. External  assistance  has  been  a  major  source  of  funding  for  the  rehabilitation  and\ndevelopment of the country\u2019s urban water supply and sanitation. Over $800 million has been\nprovided in the last decade for improving water supply and sanitation in 59 cities and provincial\ntowns. Since 1993, ADB, a lead external funding agency in the sector, has approved three loans\ntotaling $200 million for water supply and sanitation. The first loan, approved in 1993 for the\nHCMC Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project6, aimed at providing safe and reliable\nwater supply, improved sanitation, sewerage, and drainage facilities in HCMC with institutional\nand management support. The subsequent two loans, approved in 1995 and 1997, respectively,\nwere provided for improving water supply and sanitation in provincial towns.7 The first one\u2019s\nobjectives are expanding the piped water supply and sanitation facilities, reducing water losses,\nstrengthening  the  institutional  capabilities  of  WSCs,  and  helping  to  implement  low-cost\nsanitation and community environmental health education programs. The second one is aimed\nat improving public health in the provincial towns, improving the urban environment, enhancing\npublic awareness of hygiene and sanitation, and restructuring and strengthening existing sector\ninstitutions.  ADB  also  funded  the  HCMC  Environmental  Improvement  Project  to  improve\ndrainage and solid waste in the city.8 Apart from the TAs for preparing these projects, ADB also\nprovided  several  advisory  TAs,9  whose  recommendations  have  been  accepted  by  the\nGovernment for developing the national water supply tariff guidelines, strengthening the WSCs,\nand enhancing community health awareness.\n22. In addition to ADB, major external funding agencies active in the sector include the\ngovernments of Australia, Denmark, Finland, France, and Japan, as well as the World Bank.\nDetails of external assistance to the sector are presented in Appendix 2. Their major assistance\nis as follows:\n(i)  Australia: (a) Five Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project, 1995-2000; and\n(b) the feasibility studies, detailed design, preparation of contract documents,\ntender  evaluation,  and  capacity  building  for  a  Da  Nang  water  supply  and\nsanitation project;\n(ii)  Denmark: (a) water supply projects for Da Lat, Hon Gai, Cam Pha and Buon Ma\nThuot; (b) the national rural water supply strategy; (c) capacity building for sector\ninstitutions at the national level; (d) the Di An and Nam Binh Dung water supply\nprojects; and (e) rural water supply and sanitation projects in Dac Lac, Ha Tinh\nand Nghe An;\n(iii)  Finland: (a) rehabilitation and upgrading of Hai Phong and Hanoi water supply\nsystems,  including  master  plans,  feasibility  studies,  technical  assistance,\n                  \n6  Loan 1273-VIE: Ho Chi Minh City Water Supply and Sanitation Rehabilitation Project, for $65.0 million, approved on 29\nNovember 1993.\n7  Loan 1361-VIE; Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project, for $66.0 million, approved on 17 August 1995;\nand Loan 1514-VIE: Second Provincial Towns Water Supply and Sanitation Project, for $69.0 million, approved on 27\nFebruary 1997.\n8  Loan 1702-VIE: Ho Chi Minh City Environmental Improvement Project, for $70.0 million, approved on 7 October 1999.\n9  TA 1998-VIE: National Water Tariff Policy Study, TA 1999-VIE: Institutional Strengthening of Ho Chi Minh City Water\nSupply Company, and TA 2000-VIE: Ho Chi Minh City Water Supply Mater Plan; each for $600,000, and all approved on\n29 November 1993. Additionally, TA 2375-VIE: Capacity Building for Provincial Water Supply and Sanitation Planning and\nManagement, and TA No. 2376-VIE: Community Environmental Health Improvements for the Provincial Towns, for\n$700,000 and $500,000, respectively, were approved on 17 August 1995.", "8\nimplementation and capacity building; and (b) technical assistance to the Hanoi\nWSC, and the national urban water supply strategy, and the national urban\nsanitation strategy;\n(iv)  France: (a) water supply projects in 15 towns; and (b) technical assistance for\ntraining of Hanoi WSC staff, and for Gia Lam training center in Hanoi;\n(v)  Japan: (a) rehabilitation and upgrading of water supplies in small to medium\ntowns throughout Viet Nam; and (b) upgrading water supply services in Hanoi, a\nmaster plan for Hanoi sewerage, and a feasibility study for HCMC drainage and\nenvironmental sanitation; and\n(vi)  World Bank: (a) water supply and sanitation projects in Hanoi, Hai Phong, Da\nNang, and Hon Gai/Cam Pha; (b) an environmental sanitation project in HCMC;\nand  (c)  TA  for  strengthening  the  Management  Board  for  Water  Supply  and\nSanitation Development Projects, and a strategy for district towns water supply.\nD.  Lessons Learned\n23. Water  supply  and  sanitation  projects  assisted  by  external  funding  agencies  in  the\ncountry have generally failed to follow their implementation schedules. This reflects partly the\nrigidity of the centrally controlled decision making process and partly poor understanding of the\nGovernment procedures and the resultant unrealistic expectations. The three ADB-assisted\nprojects in the sector have suffered from (i) delay in loan signing (the Second Provincial Towns\nWater Supply and Sanitation Project) (ii) delays in loan effectiveness (the HCMC Water Supply\nand Sanitation Rehabilitation Project and the Second Provincial Towns Water Supply Project)\nand (iii) delays in contract awards and disbursements in all three ADB-assisted projects.\n24. The  lessons  learned  from  ADB\u2019s  assistance  in  the  sector  point  to  the  need  for  a\ncontinued policy dialogue on delegation of more authority to lower level government agencies\nfor project implementation. Delays could be significantly reduced if PPCs have the authority to\napprove  project  designs,  bidding  documents,  bid  evaluation,  and  contract  awards  and\nvariations. The lessons also show the need for intensive assistance to the executing and\nimplementing  agencies  in  project  planning  and  management  at  the  early  stage  of\nimplementation. Delays could be minimized by advance actions to recruit project management\nand  engineering  design  consultants,  establish  a  project  implementation  and  management\nstructure, and prepare for land acquisition and resettlement. Early and systematic training in\nGovernment and ADB procedures for all project stakeholders including consultants, counterpart\nstaff, and representatives of community groups, will be essential to minimize delays.\n25. Positive  lessons  have  also  been  learned  through  ADB-assisted  TA  2376-VIE:\nCommunity Environmental Health Improvements for the Provincial Towns.10 These  are  (i)\ncommunities must decide their own priorities and technology choices to suit their capacity and\nfinancial means; (ii) transparency in funds transfers from the project and local government to the\ncommunity for micro activities and awareness campaigns is essential to generate community\nsupport and trust; (iii) VWU has the network, experience, and mandate to work effectively at the\ngrassroots level in environmental health improvement; (iv) community motivators must be paid\nas an incentive to carry out awareness activities; (v) WSCs must be involved in community\nactivities,  particularly  public  health  awareness,  early  in  the  project  as  they  have  valuable\ntechnical information needed by the communities; (vi) PPCs need to be involved in community\ndevelopment  activities  as  they  control  the  budget  and  approve  the  work  of  lower  levels\n                  \n10 for $500,000, approved on 17 August 1995.", "9\nagencies; and (vii) public health awareness activities need to coincide with the construction of\nmajor physical infrastructure.\nE.  ADB's Sector Strategy\n26. ADB\u2019s  operational  strategy  for  Viet  Nam  is  to  support  the  Government\u2019s  vision  of\neconomic modernization and poverty reduction by making economic growth and the structural\ntransition pro-poor and sustainable. To this end, ADB will focus its operations on three pillars:\npro-poor sustainable economic growth, social development, and good governance. In line with\nthis  overall  operational  strategy,  ADB\u2019s  strategy  in  the  urban  water  and  sanitation  sector,\ntherefore, will be to (i) support rehabilitation, upgrading, and expansion of water supply and\nsanitation system in urban centers to improve the investment environment; (ii) ensure equitable\naccess to safe water supply and sanitation facilities and improve the health profile of the urban\nresidents; and (iii) encourage policy changes and institutional reforms at central and provincial\nlevels to enable sustainable development. The immediate sectoral objective of ADB is to make\nWSCs financially viable with adequate cost recovery. In the medium term, ADB seeks full\nautonomy  of  WSCs  in  financial  and  operational  management,  and  the  establishment  of  a\nsuitable  regulatory  framework  for  the  sector.  The  long-term  objective  will  be  to  break  the\ndominance of SOEs in the sector, including the related consulting services and civil works\ncontracting, by creating a conducive environment for private sector participation. Operationally,\nADB\u2019s assistance in the sector will gradually shift from large cities to provincial towns, and\nexpand from provincial towns to district towns, assisting the Government in improving the basic\nurban infrastructure to mitigate the social and economic pressure arising from significant rural-\nurban migration.\nF.  Policy Dialogue\n27. Policy dialogue with the Government has been carried out since the first ADB-assisted\nwater supply and sanitation project in the country in 1995. One important aspect of the dialogue\nrelates to the transition of WSCs from subsidized entities operating in a planned environment to\ncommercial companies operating in a market economy, self-financing capital expansion and\nO&M through user charges, and accountable to owners and consumers. The dialogue led to the\nGovernment\u2019s permission for WSCs to retain funds accumulated through depreciation that were\npreviously submitted to the PPCs. The dialogue, and ADB assistance, also enabled MOC to\nissue  national  water  tariff  guidelines  based  on  the  principle  of  full  cost  recovery.  While\nGovernment policies support autonomy of WSCs and full cost recovery for water supply, and\nthe MOC tariff guidelines set out the methodology for achieving this objective, existing tariff\nlevels for virtually all WSCs are not sufficient for long-term financially sustainable operations.\nWSCs are generally under budgeted for adequate O&M, have no provisions for debt service,\nand make no allowance for income generation other than through depreciation. Apart from\nreducing necessary expenditures on O&M, WSCs have also been engaged in construction\nbusiness to supplement their revenues from water sales. This distorts the real cost of water\nproduction and sales and creates excessive demand for water supply. The water tariffs in the\nproject towns either have no progressive block structure or the volume of the lifeline block is too\nhigh to have any effect on demand management. The dialogue with the PPCs and WSCs has\nbeen  focusing  on  the  need  to  improve  water  tariff  structure  and  increase  the  tariffs  to  a\nsustainable level. The dialogue also aims at improving WSCs\u2019 financial management, and\nseparating water supply operations from the construction business to make transparent the cost\nof water supply and subsidies.", "10\n28. With respect to environmental sanitation, the dialogue focuses on the need to establish\nand enforce local regulations on sanitation standards, water source protection, wastewater\ntreatment and discharge, and ground water licensing. Unless the regulations are established\nand  enforced,  the  perceived  benefits  of  water  supply  and  sanitation  projects  may  not  be\nrealized. Specifically, the regulations required are (i) connecting sullage drains and septic tanks\nto drains in high and medium density areas, and to drains or properly designed and constructed\nsoakaways in low density areas; (ii) providing a septic tank that meets prescribed standards in\neach household or business location in high and medium density areas; (iii) allowing piped\nwater supply connection only when sullage pipes discharging to drains or properly constructed\nsoakaways are provided for; (iv) preventing pollution in the vicinity of surface intakes and\nborefields; (v) controling and monitoring activities in catchments upstream of water supply\nintakes  and  borefields;  (vi)  enforcing  regulations  on  treatment  and  discharge  of  industrial\nwastewater; and (vii) licensing industrial, commercial, and domestic use of groundwater in\nsensitive areas, and banning industrial and commercial use of groundwater in areas where\npiped water supply is available. These regulations have been incorporated in the Project design.\n29. Another major aspect of the policy dialogue focuses on improving the efficiency of sector\ninstitutions by delegating project implementation functions from MOC to PPCs. Such delegation\nwill allow PPCs, which own the eventual infrastructure constructed and pay the debt service of\nexternal loans, to participate fully in the design, implementation, and O&M of the Project. The\ndelegation will also reduce the layers of required approvals and hence the delays in project\nimplementation. MOC, with overall responsibility for sector development, will focus on sector\npolicy formulation, development planning, standards monitoring and enforcement, and training\nand  capacity  building.  The  dialogue  has  lead  to  more  decentralized  implementation\narrangements under the proposed Project, where PPCs will be responsible for approval of\nfeasibility study reports, project designs, bidding documents, bid evaluation, contract awards,\nand contract variations for the components within the administrative authority of the PPCs.\nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT\nA.  Rationale\n30. Water supply and sanitation are essential services in the urban centers to meet the basic\nhuman needs of the urban population, foster private investment, and sustain economic growth.\nEquitable access to these facilities is important for addressing the urban poverty. Consequently\nthe Government gives high development priority to the improvement of these facilities in the\nurban centers. Substantial funds from external funding agencies have been directed toward\nthese sectors. The provincial towns to be covered under the Project were selected from the\nseven remaining provincial towns that have not received any substantial funding assistance for\nthe improvement of water supply and sanitation.\n31. The water supply systems in the project towns11 are in poor condition, due to lack of\ninvestment and inadequate O&M. The pipes are incompatible or unsuitable, treatment plants\nand equipment inefficient, and coverage low. Supply is intermittent in some towns, ranging from\n5-6 hours a day in La Hai to 18 hours a day in Rach Gia and 24 hours a day in Thu Dau Mot.\nEstimated unaccounted-for water (UFW) ranges from 32 to 54 percent in the project towns. A\n                  \n11 These are Chi Thanh, La Hai, Phan Rang, Rach Gia, Tay Ninh, Thu Dau Mot, and Tuy Hoa; Chi Thanh and La Hai\nare district towns in Phu Yen province, of which Tuy Hoa is the provincial capital.", "11\nlarge  proportion  of  the  urban  population  use  water  from  contaminated  wells  and  surface\nsources, or purchase water from vendors at prices much higher than those of public water\nsupply.\n32. Sanitation in the project towns is also inadequate, with low coverage of piped drains and\nseptic tank systems. There are no municipal wastewater treatment plants in any of the project\ntowns, and partially treated or untreated wastewater from industries and hospitals is discharged\ndirectly to drainage canals or nearby waterways. About 40 percent of the households in the\nproject towns have septic tanks, with a high proportion improperly designed and constructed,\nand unconnected to sewers, drains or soakaways. Households with flush toilets and septic\ntanks range from 6 percent in La Hai to 86 percent in Tuy Hoa, and approximately 46 percent of\nhouseholds discharge sullage water from kitchens and bathrooms to yards, gardens, or roads.\nThe substandard water supplies and inadequate sanitation systems pose great health risks to\nthe entire urban population, particularly the urban poor who often live in low-lying areas or at the\nextremities of the water supply system. The water supply and sanitation conditions in the project\ntowns are summarized in Table 2.\nTable 2: Water Supply and Sanitation Conditions in Project towns\nService Area Household  Water Population Per Capita Septic\nTown Population Supply Coverage with Piped Consumption tanks\n(2000) (%) Water (lpcd) (% of HH)\nChi Thanh 21,800 9 2,000 83 20\nLa Hai 9,400 4 400 70 6\nPhan Rang 184,800 32 59,200 76 44\nRach Gia 176,300 55 97,500 106 52\nTay Ninh 101,000 25 25,400 111 67\nThu Dau Mot 262,000 18 48,100 137 >45\nTuy Hoa 95,000 22 20,500 126 86\nTotal 850,300 30 253,200 107   <41\nHH = households.\nSource: WSCs documents; ADB estimates.\n33. All project towns have serious drainage problems. The drains have become heavily\nsilted  with  sediment,  sewage,  and  rubbish,  leading  to  blockages,  uncontrolled  overflows,\nflooding, and bad odors. Many of the towns are on the river banks or the coast, and floods or\nhigh tides aggravate their drainage problems. Some parts of Rach Gia and Tuy Hoa are flooded\nseveral  times  annually  because  of  inadequate  drainage  systems.  Floodwaters  mixed  with\nwastewater expose residents to health risks, and damage property and infrastructure. In many\nproject towns, it is difficult to discharge wastewater and stormwater effectively during floods or\nhigh tides, since river or sea levels are above drainage outlet levels, and many areas are\ninundated for long periods. Thus shallow wells become contaminated and the public is exposed\nto direct contact with pollutants from floodwaters.\n34. The Project will assist the Government to achieve its development objectives for the\nsector as outlined in the Orientation Plan for Urban Water Supply to 2020, and will address the\nurgent need in the project towns for improved water supply and sanitation facilities. The Project\nwill improve the urban environment and health profile of the urban residents. The Project will\ncontribute  to  ADB\u2019s  commitment  to  reduce  poverty  and  substantially  improve  the  living\nconditions of the poor in the towns. The Project, located in central and southern Viet Nam, will\nalso support the Government\u2019s commitment to promote development in regions experiencing\nrelatively lower rates of economic growth.", "12\nB.  Objectives and Scope\n35. The Project aims to improve water supply and environmental sanitation conditions in the\nproject towns through integrating critically needed infrastructure developments with community\nawareness and participation, improved financial management and cost recovery by WSCs, and\nlocal regulations on sanitation, wastewater management, and water source protection. The\nscope  of  the  Project  includes  the  design,  development,  and  delivery  of  (i)  a  community\nenvironmental sanitation improvement program in each project town; (ii) water supply systems\nto provide better quality water and greater coverage in the towns and adjoining districts; (iii)\ndrainage and sanitation improvements; and (iv) project implementation assistance and capacity\nbuilding. Details are as follows.\n1. Part A: Community Environmental Sanitation Improvement.\n36. This part of the Project has two subcomponents: (i) a public health awareness program\n(PHAP), and (ii) community environmental sanitation improvement (CESI). The PHAP aims at\nenhancing the communities\u2019 awareness of the relationships between water, sanitation, and\nhealth, and motivating households to connect to piped water supply and convert to pour flush\ntoilets with septic tanks. The awareness activities will focus on economic and health benefits of\npiped water supply, basic hygiene practices, safe excreta disposal, and proper disposal of solid\nwaste and wastewater to improve the environment and reduce personal health risks. In addition,\nthe PHAP will include education on the need for adequate cost recovery and compliance with\nlocal sanitation regulations. The PHAP will inform the communities of the availability of financial\nsupport through the CESI.\n37. The  provincial  VWU  will  be  responsible  for  carrying  out  the  PHAP  and  will  utilize\nmaterials, manuals, and training methods developed under ADB\u2019s first Provincial Towns Water\nSupply and Sanitation Project.12 These materials have been field-tested and subsequently used\nin some towns. Posters and leaflets will be modified to specifically target the smaller district\ncenters  and  some  ethnic  minority  groups  such  as  the  Cham  and  Khmer.  Pilot  wards  or\ncommunes in each provincial town will be targeted for intensive health awareness planning,\nimplementation,  and  impact  monitoring.  After  an  initial  six-month  period,  the  activities  will\nexpand to other wards or communes, as expertise and experience develop within provincial\nproject management units (PPMUs) and provincial VWUs. For district towns, the entire town\nareas  will  be  targeted  for  public  health  awareness  activities.  PPMUs  will  coordinate  with\nadministrative, community, health, and welfare organizations and nongovernment organizations\n(NGOs), in support of the provincial VWUs.\n38. The  CESI  aims  at  providing  small-scale  environmental  sanitation  improvements  not\ncovered by the main construction contracts, to meet the demand for improvements generated\nthrough  the  PHAP.  The  CESI  will  establish  procedures  for  community-based  sanitation\nimprovement, and define roles and responsibilities for the stakeholders such as WSCs, people\u2019s\ncommittees at all levels, NGOs, mass organizations, and the general communities with respect\nto  sanitation  improvement.  It  intends  to  stimulate  community  participation  in  planning  and\nimplementation. The exact scope of the CESI in each town will depend on community demand\nand the priorities established by town authorities. Items eligible for financing may include: (i)\ntoilets with septic tanks at schools, aid posts, and public or communal residential areas; (ii)\nwashbasins at schools, aid posts, people\u2019s committees, and other public locations; (iii) rubbish\n                  \n12 TA 2376-VIE: Community Environmental Health Improvements for the Provincial Towns, for $500,000, approved in \nAugust 1995.", "13\nbins and handcarts, collection depots, and collection and disposal systems; (iv) small-scale\ndrainage linking to larger improvements under the Project; and (v) cleaning of unofficial public\nwaste dumping areas, such as drains, canals, and other waterways, and public land.\n39. For public sanitation improvement, CESI funds will be provided, in two tranches as\ngrants, through the PPMU, to the town or district people\u2019s committees as matching funds to\nmeet  no  more  than  60  percent  of  the  cost  of  the  identified  projects,  and  local  people\u2019s\ncommittees will be responsible for financing the remaining 40 percent cost and for implementing\nand monitoring the activities. For household sanitation improvement, CESI will provide credit\nassistance  through  provincial  VWUs  to  low-income  groups  for  improving  or  constructing\nsanitation facilities, including septic tanks, bathrooms, and connections to drains or sewers. The\ncredit will cover 50-80 percent of the cost depending on the level of incomes of the borrowers.\nProvincial  VWUs,  with  assistance  from  the  consultants  and  PPMU,  will  work  with  local\ngovernments to establish the terms and conditions for the credit scheme in each project town.\n2.  Part B: Water Supply\n40. The water supply systems in the five provinces will be upgraded and expanded to the\ncapacity of 220,000 cubic meters (m3) per day in the service areas in 2010. The Project will\nupgrade  and  expand  raw  water  systems,  water  treatment  plants,  pumping  stations,  and\nreservoirs in the project towns. It will install about 901 kilometers (km) of new pipes to augment\nand expand the transmission and distribution networks, including replacement of about 85 km of\nthe existing treated water transmission and distribution mains, and add about 78,100 new\nservice connections. The Project will also provide mechanical and electrical equipment as well\nas equipment for construction and O&M. In addition, an UFW program will be carried out in\neach project town to identify the main sources of technical and commercial losses, provide\nequipment and training for leak detection, and reduce UFW to optimum levels based on cost-\nbenefit analyses.\n41. In Tay Ninh and Thu Dau Mot, sludge lagoons will be constructed adjacent to the water\ntreatment  plants  to  receive  backwash  water  and  sludge  from  the  existing  and  new\nsedimentation tanks. Surplus water from the lagoons will be discharged to the treatment plants'\ndrainage  systems.  For  Phan  Rang  and  Rach  Gia  water  treatment  plants,  sludge  from\nsedimentation tanks and backwash water will be discharged to storage basins, and surplus\nwater will be discharged through drains directly to the adjacent canal or river under suitable tide\nand streamflow conditions. For Chi Thanh, La Hai, and Tuy Hoa plants, backwash water will be\nconveyed to settling basins, with surplus water being discharged to drains or canals adjacent to\nthe water treatment plants. The sludge that accumulates in sludge lagoons, storage basins, and\nsettling basins will be dewatered and taken to the towns' landfills. Table 3 summarizes the\nexpected outcome of the water supply and sanitation components of the Project by 2010.\n3.  Part C: Drainage and Sanitation\n42. Part C has two subcomponents: drainage improvement and sanitation improvement. The\ndrainage improvements will include the rehabilitation and cleaning of 22 km of existing drains,\nand construction of 69 km of secondary and tertiary drains in the towns. These works will\nimprove existing drainage conditions, relieve flooding in selected critical areas, and provide\nbasic drainage in high-density areas to ensure that wastewater can be discharged to drains\nwithout  affecting  health  and  environmental  conditions.  Equipment  and  tools  for  O&M  of\ncombined drainage systems will also be provided to WSCs or public works companies (PWCs)\nin the towns.", "14\nTable 3:  Forecast Conditions After Project (Year 2010)\nService Area Household Water Population Per Capita Septic tanks\nTown Population Supply Coverage with Piped Consumption (% of HH)\n(2010) (%) Water (lpcd)\nChi Thanh 26,300 49 12,800 100 50\nLa Hai 11,300 80 9,000 100 50\nPhan Rang 256,600 81 208,800 111 60\nRach Gia 213,000 86 182,400 120 62\nTay Ninh 137,000 69 94,700 120 69\nThu Dau Mot 385,000 74 285,000 120 53\nTuy Hoa 117,100 87 102,000 115 87\nTotal 1,146,300 78 894,700 117 61\nSource: ADB estimates.\n43. Works under sanitation improvement will include (i) introducing septic tank management\nsystems in project towns to control the design, construction, registration, and desludging of\nseptic tanks, and a septic tank database to be integrated with the computerized billing system in\neach WSC, to monitor and manage the septic tanks maintenance in the communities; (ii)\nimproving public sanitation facilities in markets, bus stations, railway stations, boat harbors,\nhospitals,  and  primary  and  secondary  schools;  and  (iiii)  supplying  WSCs  or  PWCs  with\nequipment for construction, and O&M of sanitation facilities. This subcomponent, combined with\nthe CESI program of Part A, will construct about 20,000 septic tanks in the project areas.\n4.  Part D: Implementation Assistance and Capacity Building\n44. Part D has two subcomponents: (i) project orientation assistance (POA), and (ii) project\nimplementation assistance (PIA). The objective of POA is to provide institutional and managerial\nassistance to project coordination unit (PCU) and PPMUs prior to the commencement of the\ndetailed designs. The POA will help establish PPMUs\u2019 functional procedures; set up project\naccounts and management information systems; and deliver intensive training to the PCU and\nPPMUs in project management, procurement, accounting, administration, reporting, monitoring\nand evaluation (M&E), and ADB and Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD) procedures.\nThe consultant will prepare project administration procedures, manuals, and related software.\nExperienced staff of MOC, MOF, Ministry of Planning and Investment, State Bank of Viet Nam,\nADB, and AFD will be invited to provide training to members of the PCU, PPMUs, and related\nprovincial and local organizations. Workshops, seminars, and training will be held in HCMC and\nthe provinces.\n45. PIA will comprise the consulting services for the engineering design and construction\nsupervision for Parts B and C, as well as design and delivery of Part A. The PIA will also include\nassistance in capacity building for WSCs aimed at improving their long-term sustainability. It\ncovers  financial  management,  UFW  management,  and  asset  management.  Financial\nmanagement will focus on water tariff planning, billing, and collections; computerization of\naccounting  systems;  capital  investment  and  budgeting,  and  management  of  accounts\nreceivable. UFW management will identify the main sources of technical and commercial losses\nto reduce UFW to optimum levels, based on cost-benefit analyses. It will include leak detection,\ncustomer  registration,  and  meter  management.  Asset  management  will  assist  WSCs  in\nmanaging  asset  inventories,  preparing  O&M  plans  and  guidelines,  and  budgeting  for\nappropriate asset maintenance. The Project will also improve workshop and laboratory facilities,\nand provide equipment for construction and O&M of water and drainage facilities.", "15\nC.  Cost Estimates\n46. The total project cost is estimated at $98.0 million equivalent, comprising $50.4 million\n(51.4 percent) equivalent as foreign exchange cost, including about $1.1 million interest charges\nduring construction; and $47.6 million equivalent (48.6 percent) as local currency cost, including\nduties and taxes of about $5.6 million.

Financing Plan\n47. It is proposed that ADB provide a loan of $60 million equivalent from its Special Funds\nresources to cover 61.2 percent of the total project cost, including $18.6 million equivalent of\nlocal currency cost. ADB financing of local currency cost is justified by the tight fiscal conditions\nof the provincial governments, which are responsible for providing the counterpart funds and the\ndebt service payment of the Project. The ADB loan will have a maturity of 32 years with a grace\nperiod of 8 years, and an interest rate of 1 percent per annum during the grace period and 1.5\npercent per annum thereafter. AFD will provide a loan of 12.4 million euro ($11.0 million) to\ncofinance on a parallel basis 11.2 percent of the total project cost. The AFD loan will have a\nmaturity of 17 years with a grace period of 6 years, and an interest rate of 2.5 percent per\nannum.13 The remaining $27 million, equivalent to 27.6 percent of the total project cost, is the\nlocal counterpart contribution, of which the PPCs will finance $23.5 million equivalent, and the\nproject beneficiaries will contribute the remaining $3.5 million equivalent in the form of payment\nfor water supply connections. The financing plan is summarized in Table 5.14\n48. Part of the loan funds from ADB and AFD will be relent by the Government to WSCs\nthrough  subsidiary  loans  in  domestic  currency  to  cover  the  cost  of  water  supply  systems\nupgrading and expansion, and part will be provided to PPCs as grants to cover the cost of other\ncomponents. The terms of the subsidiary loans to WSCs will be based on the blended terms of\n                  \n13 The AFD loan\u2019s terms are adjusted annually at the beginning of each calendar year, and will be fixed for the entire\nmaturity once approved by its board.\n14 The Government is requesting a grant from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD) to\ncofinance, on a parallel basis, the consulting services under POA. If the request is approved by NORAD, POA will\nbe under NORAD financing instead of ADB loan.", "16\nADB and AFD loans, and will have a maturity of 22 years with a grace period of 6 years, and a\nfixed interest rate of six percent per annum. The Government will assume the foreign exchange\nrisk. All the taxes and duties will be paid by the provincial governments.\nTable 5: Proposed Financing Plan\n($ million)\nForeign Local Total Percent\nSource Exchange Currency Cost\nAsian Development Bank 41.4 18.6 60.0 61.2\nAgence Francaise de Developpement 6.6 4.4 11.0 11.2\nProvincial governments 0.0 23.5 23.5 24.0\nBeneficiaries 2.4 1.1 3.5 3.6\nTotal 50.4 47.6 98.0 100.0\nPercent 51.4 48.6 100.0\nSource: ADB estimates.\nE.  Executing Agencies\n49. The PPC in each project province will be the Executing Agency responsible for all the\nimplementation issues in the province. In line with the Government\u2019s decentralization policy and\nas part of the state enterprise reform, the responsibility for operating public utilities, including\nwater supply, has been assigned to PPCs. While PPCs have designated WSCs as the legal\nentities responsible for construction and O&M of urban water supply, PPCs have considerable\ninfluence on the WSCs\u2019 development activities, including setting targets for water production\nand distribution, and deciding on WSCs\u2019 financial policies including tariffs.\n50. The provincial WSC will play significant roles in the implementation of the Project in each\nprovince. WSCs manage both district and provincial towns\u2019 water supply systems. As of 2000,\nthe number of employees in the five provincial WSCs ranged from 43 in Phu Yen to 175 in Kien\nGiang. The number of employees per thousand connections varied from about 8 in Phu Yen\nand Ninh Thuan, to 11 in Kien Giang, and 17-19 in Tay Ninh and Binh Duong. By 2010, the ratio\nis expected to stabilize at about 10-15, which is typical for well-managed water supply systems\nin similar sized Asian towns, as a result of the improvement in management and increase in the\nnumber of connections. Staffing of the WSCs is summarized in Table 6.\nTable 6:  WSC Staffing Levels\nCompany Systems Production Connections Staff Numbers Staff/1000 Prof.\nWSC No. (m3/d) No. Prof. Other Total Connections Staff (%)\nKien Giang 6 15,800 16,700 12 163 175 10.5 7\nBinh Duong 2 11,600 5,180 38 62 100 19.3 38\nTay Ninh 4 6,500 5,180 23 66 89 17.2 26\nPhu Yen 6 7,400 5,790 17 26 43 7.4 40\nNinh Thuan 3 7,700 11,080 17 77 94 8.5 18\nNotes:\n 1. Production and connections are based on figures for year 2000 and include all systems managed by the WSCs.\n 2. Staff numbers include all systems managed by the WSCs, but exclude construction teams.\n 3. Professional staff include engineers, accountants, economists, lawyers, hydrologists.\nSource: provincial WSCs\u2019 documents.\n51. As legally distinct business entities, WSCs retain all the revenues generated from their\nactivities, less income and other taxes. However, the financial and management autonomy of", "17\nWSCs is limited due to the requirement for government approval of most key management and\noperating  decisions.  This  includes  the  determination  of  tariff  structures  and  levels,  overall\nproduction  levels,  staff  salary  and  benefit  levels,  capital  expenditures,  and  senior  staff\nappointments. The accounting and financial department of a WSC is responsible for preparing\nand maintaining core accounting systems of the company and for all external reporting. The\nnumber of accounting and financial department staff, including the chief accountant, in the\nproject WSCs ranges from four in Ninh Thuan, Phu Yen, and Tay Ninh, to eight in Kieng Giang,\nand nine in Binh Duong. In addition to the accounting and financial department, three other\ndepartments  within  the  WSC  undertake  financial  management  functions.  The  business\ndepartment  is  responsible  for  customer  billing  and  collections,  including  receivable\nmanagement. The planning and procurement department is responsible for preparing plans for\nsales, operation, and capital expenditure, and for all procurement. The payroll and personnel\ndepartment is responsible for payroll and personnel management.\n52. Statutory  requirements  for  accounting,  reporting,  and  auditing  in  Viet  Nam  are\nestablished  and  regulated  by  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF).  The  monitoring  of  WSCs'\ncompliance with these requirements is normally delegated to the provincial departments of\nfinance (DOFs) and tax bureaus. Current Vietnamese accounting standards, which became\neffective as of 1 January 1996 under Decision No. 1141-TC-CDKT, are referred to as the Viet\nNam Accounting System - 1995 (VAS-1995).  All SOEs, including the WSCs, are required to\nuse VAS-1995, which is fairly consistent with international accounting standards. There is no\nstatutory requirement for an audit of the WSCs accounts by an independent auditor. DOFs\nnormally examine the financial statements and records on behalf of the PPCs to ensure that the\ncapitals held by WSCs have been properly accounted for in accordance with all applicable\nGovernment regulations and to determine taxes payable.\nF.  Implementation Arrangements\n1.  Project Management Structure\n53. The PPC in each province will set up a provincial steering committee (PSC),15 which, on\nbehalf of the PPC, will have the overall responsibilities for the project implementation. The PSC\nwill comprise senior officials from the PPC, department of construction, DOF, department of\nplanning and investment, town people\u2019s committees, district people\u2019s committees, provincial\nVWUs, and manager of the PPMU. The PSC will appoint PPMU staff and experts, provide\npolicy guidance to the PPMU and consultants, and coordinate provincial agencies to ensure\ntimely project implementation. Specifically, the PSC will have the following responsibilities: (i)\nadvise the PPC on the implementation status of the Project in the province; (ii) assist the PPC in\nmaking  decisions  on  issues  related  to  project  implementation  within  the  authority  of  the\nprovincial  government;  (iii)  assist  the  PPC  in  approving  key  provincial  project  documents,\nincluding feasibility study reports, provincial bidding plans, bid documents, draft contracts, bid\nevaluation, and contract awards and variations; (iv) assist the PPC in approving the budget for\ncounterpart funds and ensuring their timely release; (v) coordinate provincial organizations and\nPPMU in project implementation; and (vi) assist the PPC in approving other project documents\nsubmitted by the PPMU.\n54. The PPC in each province will set up a PPMU with the director of WSC serving as its\nmanager. The PPMU will be responsible for day-to-day project implementation in the province\nand  will  comprise  staff  from  the  WSC  and  provincial-, town- , or district-level agencies, with\n                  \n15 Except in Ninh Thuan province, where the PPC prefers to place PPMU under its direct control.", "18\nexpertise  in  project  management,  water  supply  engineering,  sanitary  engineering,\nenvironmental management, accounting, and community education and development. The main\ntasks of the PPMU are to:\n(i)  supervise work schedules and performance of the consultants in the province,\nand  review  designs,  bidding  plans,  bidding  documents,  and  contracts  and\nprepare recommendations for approvals by provincial authorities;\n(ii)  prequalify  contractors  and  undertake  contract  negotiations,  supervise  the\nperformance of contractors, certify the quality and quantity of their output, and\nauthorize payments accordingly;\n(iii)  prepare withdraw applications for approval by MOF before submitting them to\nADB;\n(iv)  approve  payment  through  an  imprest  account  and  maintain  disbursement\nrecords;\n(v)  prepare  monthly  and  quarterly  project  progress  reports  to  the  PCU  for\nconsolidation before submission to the central steering committee (CSC) and\nADB, and help prepare the project completion report;\n(vi)  maintain sound project accounts and ensure timely completion and submission of\nthe account and financial statements of WSC for auditing;\n(vii)  coordinate  all  field-level  activities  of  all  provincial-,  district-,  and  town-level\nagencies related to the Project;\n(viii)  supervise the compliance with the local sanitation regulations and recommend\nactions for PPCs for improvement;\n(ix)  prepare monitoring and evaluation (M&E) reports to PSC, PCU, and ADB; and\n(x)  supervise the implementation of resettlement plans approved under this Project.\n55. The provincial VWU will be responsible for implementing and managing the PHAP and\nthe sanitation credit scheme in the project towns. With assistance from consultants, and in\nconsultation with the PPMU and district- and town-level government agencies, the provincial\nVWU will organize and carry out the PHAP. Through its lower level offices, the provincial VWU\nwill promote public awareness about the credit scheme, identify poor households, establish\ncredit terms and conditions, process credit applications, collect repayments, maintain accounts\nand records, and arrange for inspection and certification by the PPMU and other appropriate\nauthorities. The provincial VWU will provide a quarterly report and a detailed annual report to\nthe PPMU on credit scheme activities. The PPMU will be responsible for monitoring the credit\nschemes in the province. The accounts of the credit scheme will be subject to audit by the same\nproject auditor to be appointed by the CSC and acceptable to ADB.\n56. To ensure standards and quality in project implementation, monitoring, and report, a\nCSC will be established, comprising one senior official from MOC as chairperson and the five\nproject provinces as members. The CSC may invite ADB or AFD staff as observers. The CSC\nwill  be  assisted  by  a  PCU  comprising  full-time  professional  staff  with  adequate  project\nexperience and proficiency in English language. The PCU will be responsible for selecting\nconsultants  and  supervising  their  work  programs  and  staffing  schedules;  preparing  a\nconsolidated project progress report for CSC and ADB; recording and reviewing withdrawal\napplications from PPMUs; preparing terms of reference for auditing all the project accounts;\nrecommending a qualified auditing firm to the CSC for its approval and negotiating the contract;\nreviewing  the  audited  statements  of  project  accounts,  and  following  up  on  the\ncomments/recommendations of the auditor. Upon request from PPMUs, the PCU will assist in\nproject  implementation,  with  regard  to  ADB  and  AFD  procedures,  international  and  local\ncompetitive bidding processes, bid preparation and evaluation, and contract awards. The PCU", "19\nwill also assist PPMUs in the design and implementation of training programs. The PCU will\nhave its main office in HCMC.\n2.  Implementation Schedule\n57. The Project will be implemented over six years commencing in 2002 and ending in 31\nDecember 2007. An indicative project implementation schedule is presented in Appendix 4.\n3.   Advance Action\n58. A major cause of delay in earlier ADB projects is the slow process for selecting the\nconsultants. To speed up project implementation, ADB approved the request of the Government\nfor advance action to engage consultants. The Government has been advised that approval of\nthe advance action does not, in any way, commit ADB to finance the Project, and that the action\nshould be carried out in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.\n4.  Operation and Maintenance\n59. WSCs will be responsible for O&M of the water supply systems. The consultants will\nhelp develop and implement O&M plans. Specialized O&M equipment will be procured and on-\nthe-job and formal training on O&M will be provided for WSCs. Water tariffs will be adjusted to\nallow adequate funds for O&M. WSCs will establish, equip, and train permanent leak detection\nteams; install and regularly calibrate bulk water meters at treatment plants and at critical points\nin the network; introduce effective meter management, including transfer of meter ownership to\nWSCs, replacement of defective meters, and regular testing of consumer water meters; and\nmonitor the UFW program. The PWC/WSC in each town will be responsible for O&M of the\ndrainage  and  public  sanitation  facilities  constructed  under  the  Project,  while  the  individual\nhouseholds will be responsible for the O&M of the private latrines and septic tanks. The VWU in\neach province will be responsible for the operation and administration of the sanitation credit\nschemes.\n5.  Procurement\n60. Procurement under the Project will be carried out in accordance with ADB's Guidelines\nfor Procurement. Civil works and supply contracts valued above $1.0 million and $0.5 million,\nrespectively,  will  be  procured  under  international  competitive  bidding  procedures.  This  will\ninclude the civil works contracts for the water supply components and a supply contract for UFW\nequipment for the Project. Local competitive bidding contracts include minor civil works and\nsupply contracts valued at or below the given thresholds. Where special license is required or\nwhere there is no adequate competition, supply and installation contracts valued at or below\n$100,000 may be awarded following direct purchase procedures, subject to approval by ADB on\na case by case basis. This will include mainly contracts for supply and installation of power\ndistribution lines and transformers. Force accounts will be used to clean and rehabilitate water\nsupply pipelines and drains, and for service connections. Supply contracts for equipment and\nvehicles  valued  at  $0.5  million  or  less  per  contract  will  be  procured  through  international\nshopping  procedures,  and  supply  contracts  valued  at  $100,000  or  less  will  follow  direct\npurchase procedures. AFD funds will be used to finance pipes, valves, fittings, and civil works\nfor water supply distribution pipelines (50-200 millimeters in diameter) in each province under\nlocal competitive bidding procedures in accordance with the regulations of the Government.", "20\n61. For purposes of expediency, standardization, and cost effectiveness, the PCU will be\nresponsible for the procurement of (i) specialized equipment and materials for UFW programs\nunder  one  international  competitive  bidding  contract;  (ii)  computer  hardware  under  one\ninternational shopping contract; and (iii) software for WSC billing, accounting, and management\ninformation systems following direct purchase procedures. The procurement of vehicles, office\nequipment,  and  consumables  for  PPMUs,  the  PCU,  and  the  consultants  will  be  managed\nindependently  by  each  party  within  agreed  budgets,  using  international  shopping  or  direct\npurchase procedures, or according to the Government\u2019s standard procedures acceptable to\nADB. Indicative procurement packaging is presented in Appendix 5.\n6.  Consulting Services\n62. Consulting services will be provided under the loan to support project management and\nimplementation. There will be two consulting service contracts: project orientation assistance,\nand project implementation assistance. A total of 1,480 person-months of consulting services\n(206 international and 1,274 domestic) will be required for assistance in such areas as project\nmanagement, water supply engineering and design, sanitation engineering and design, UFW\nimprovement, construction management, community development, sanitation credit scheme,\ntraining and capacity building, and technical support to the PPMUs and PCU. The consulting\nservices  will  be  provided  by  international  consulting  firms  in  association  with  domestic\nconsultants. To minimize costs and facilitate access to the provinces, the consultants will be\nmainly located in HCMC and will have representatives stationed in each province to work with\nPPMUs  during  the  project  construction  stage.  PCU  representatives  will  work  with  the\nconsultants in their HCMC office. Consulting services will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s\nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB on the\nengagement  of  domestic  consultants.  The  terms  of  reference  for  consulting  services  are\npresented in Appendix 6.\n7.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement\n63. About 68 hectares of agricultural and residential land will be required for the Project.\nSome 71 households will be relocated to allow construction of reservoirs and water treatment\nplants. In addition, slightly more than 900 affected persons will be entitled to receive some form\nof compensation as a result of the Project. These are shown in Table 7.\nTable 7: Assessments of Land Acquisition and Resettlement\nProject Town Permanent Land Temporary Land Number of Households Number of Affected\nAcquisition (ha) Acquisition (ha) to be Resettled Persons\nChi Thanh 5.38 0.74 0 18\nLa Hai 0.20 0.00 0 5\nPhan Rang 1.79 1.28                 39 195\nRach Gia 16.01 17.10                 14 195\nTay Ninh 2.02 0.00 8 220\nThu Dau Mot 30.00 0.00 10 86\nTuy Hoa 12.69 0.72 0 185\nTOTAL 68.09 19.84                 71 904\nNote:  In some provinces, these estimates may be revised once detailed designs are completed.\nSource: Resettlement plans of project provinces.\n64. Land acquisition, compensation, and relocation will be carried out in accordance with\nADB policy on involuntary resettlement, Government laws, and approved resettlement plans.\nPublic consultation has been carried  out  by WSCs, and  compensation  standards  have  been", "21\nrevised accordingly. WSCs and PPCs are responsible for implementing the resettlement plans,\ncompensating resettled households and affected persons, and carrying out the land acquisition\nand relocation support. The implementation status of resettlement plans will be reported by\nWSCs in project progress reports to be submitted to PPCs, PSCs, PCU, and ADB. WSCs will\ncomplete land acquisition, compensation, and resettlement processes, and obtain rights of entry\nto  private  properties  for  both  construction  and  ongoing  maintenance  of  the  water  supply\npipelines and drains, before awarding water supply contracts. A summary of the land acquisition\nand resettlement plans for the five provinces is presented in Appendix 7.\n8.  Disbursement\n65. An imprest account for the administrative expenditures of the CSC and PCU will be\nestablished at the central level and managed by the PCU. The administrative expenditures of\nthe CSC and PCU will be shared by PPCs as part of their counterpart fund contributions. Each\nPPC will set up its own imprest account, at the provincial level, for disbursement of eligible\nfunds relating to small contracts under local competitive bidding, direct purchase, international\nshopping, and incremental administrative expenses. The PCU and each PPMU will set up its\nimprest account with a commercial bank acceptable to the Government and ADB, and will be\nresponsible for the use, management, replenishment, and liquidation of the imprest account, in\naccordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The initial amount to be deposited in\neach account will be limited to six months\u2019 projected disbursement, to be prepared by PCU and\neach PPMU, with the aggregated amount of the six imprest accounts not exceeding $3 million.\nWithdrawal applications, including imprest account replenishment requests, will be prepared by\nthe PCU and PPMUs and sent to MOF for approval. MOF will forward the approved applications\nto ADB, with a copy to the PCU. ADB will transfer funds to the imprest accounts directly upon\nreceiving the request from MOF. Funds for the sanitation credit schemes will be disbursed\nthrough PPMUs\u2019 imprest accounts to the provincial VWUs. The PCU and PPMUs may use the\nstatement  of  expenditure  procedure  for  replenishing  the  imprest  accounts,  including  the\nexpenditures incurred by the provincial VWUs, provided that each individual contract does not\nexceed the amount of $50,000.\n9.  Reports, Accounts, and Audit\n66. Each PPMU will prepare quarterly project progress reports and submit them to the PCU\nfor consolidation and reporting to the CSC and ADB. The reports will provide a narrative\ndescription of the progress during the reporting period, any modifications to the implementation\nschedule, details on land acquisition and resettlement, problems and difficulties experienced,\nremedial actions proposed, and the work to be carried out during the upcoming reporting period.\nThe PPMU quarterly progress report will include a summary of expenditures during the quarter,\nyear-to-date  expenditures,  and  total  expenditures  to  date.  WSCs  will  prepare  their  annual\nfinancial statements, including (i) the balance sheet, (ii) income statement, and, (iii) cash flow\nstatement.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  by  each  PPMU  to  the  PCU  for\nconsolidation and submission to the CSC and ADB within three months of physical completion\nof the Project. The project completion report will highlight the development impacts achieved by\nthe Project. All reports and the associated financial accounts and data will be presented to ADB\nin the English language.\n67. PPMUs, with assistance from consultants for project orientation assistance, will set up\nthe project accounts in accordance with Government regulations. The consultants will provide\ntraining and operating support to the PPMUs\u2019 accounting staff on the use of these accounts.\nThe project accounts, including the imprest accounts, and financial statements of the WSCs will", "22\nbe audited by auditors acceptable to ADB. The PPMUs will prepare the required information for\naudit in accordance with project auditing requirements of the Government and ADB. Auditing of\nthe project accounts and financial statements of WSCs will be carried out annually, and audited\nstatements of project accounts and WSCs\u2019 financial statements will be submitted to ADB within\nnine months of the close of the Government's fiscal year.\n10.  Loan Reviews\n68. ADB will conduct loan reviews at least twice yearly. In addition, a comprehensive review\nwill  be  carried  out  about  24  months  after  the  effectiveness  of  loan  agreement.  The\ncomprehensive review will evaluate the actual progress of each project component in each\nprovince; implementation procedures; monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities; functions and\nperformance of the CSC, PCU, PSCs, PPMUs, and provincial VWUs; subsidiary loan terms and\nperformance; and the performance of the consultants. The financial performance and cost\nrecovery  of  WSCs  will  also  be  evaluated.  Remedial  action  will  be  taken  to  address  any\nproblems identified.\n11.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n69. The Project includes an M&E system to ensure that water and sanitation systems are\noperating efficiently at design levels, and that consumers are deriving the envisaged benefits.\nBaseline conditions will be established prior to commissioning of project facilities. The design\nand establishment of the M&E system will be undertaken by PPMUs with assistance from the\nconsultants. The M&E system will be based on that used for previous ADB projects, using the\nsoftware developed specifically for this purpose. The PPMUs will be responsible for carrying out\nthe M&E activities, including the establishment of benchmarks through initial physical and social\nsurveys, data collection and analysis, and reporting to the PCU. The surveys will be undertaken\nannually to determine changes in the key indicators. The PCU will be responsible for submitting\na detailed implementation plan for preparing benchmarks and benefit monitoring within six\nmonths of the arrival of the design consultants, and for consolidating and submitting the annual\nM&E reports to the CSC and ADB. Detailed M&E indicators are presented in Appendix 8.\nG.  Environmental and Social Measures\n70. The Project is an environmental category B project. An initial environmental examination\nwas carried out for each project town, and a supplementary analysis was conducted for the\nproposed raw water reservoir at Rach Gia. The examinations show that adverse environmental\neffects will be limited and can be mitigated through integrated corrective measures. A detailed\nenvironmental impact assessment is not required. The examinations indicate that a safe, clean,\nreliable water supply and improved sewage disposal systems in urban areas will significantly\nimprove  the  public  health  and  environmental  conditions  in  the  project  towns.  The  existing\nproblems of polluted pools of standing water, unpleasant odors, and health risks associated with\nincreased quantities of wastewater will be improved because of the integration of water supplies\nwith improved drainage and sanitation systems and heightened public health awareness. This\nwill contribute to an improvement in the quality of life and community health profiles for the\ntowns. The disposal of sludge in the project water treatment plants will be improved by providing\nsludge lagoons, storage basins, settlement basins, and drying beds in the treatment plants.\n71. There are no known endangered varieties of flora or species of fauna, or sites of\nhistorical or cultural significance in the project areas that are likely to be affected. Land areas for\nthe proposed water  supply  and  sanitation  development   have  been  developed  or  disturbed", "23\npreviously and have no forest or unusual vegetation cover. Major impacts of the Project will be\ntemporary, including health and safety effects on communities during construction; turbidity,\ndust, and noise generated by construction equipment; and disposal of acidic sulfate soils.\nApproximately 71 households will be resettled to allow construction or expansion of water\ntreatment  plants  and  reservoirs.  WSCs  and  PPCs  will  be  responsible  for  implementing\nresettlement plans.\n72. Mitigation  measures  have  been  proposed  and  incorporated  in  project  design.\nEnvironmental management plans and monitoring programs are proposed for each project\ncomponent to the PPCs for implementation. Environmental training programs will be provided to\nthe staff of WSCs, PPMUs, and the departments of science, technology, and environment, to\nstrengthen  their  capacities  of  addressing  environmental  concerns  during  the  design  and\nconstruction phases of the Project. The contractors will be required to prepare and implement\ntheir own environmental management plans, and carry out the construction work in line with\ninternational standards. Other measures to be implemented as part of the Project include (i)\nmonitoring  of  groundwater  quality  and  quantity;  (ii)  control  and  monitoring  of  activities  in\ncatchments upstream of water supply intakes and borefields; (iii) enforcement of regulations for\ntreatment and discharge of industrial wastewater; (iv) licensing of industrial, commercial, and\ndomestic  use  of  groundwater  in  sensitive  areas;  and  (vi)  banning  of  the  industrial  and\ncommercial use of groundwater in areas where piped water supply is available.\n73. One major obstacle to poorer households connecting to piped water supply is the cost of\nconnection, which varies between towns from D600,000 to over D1.0 million, depending on the\ndistance from the reticulation pipes. To allow better access by the poor to piped water supply,\nthe Project will take measures to allow low-income households to pay by installments over 18\nmonths. The sanitation credit schemes will also alleviate the financial burdens of the low-income\nhouseholds wishing to improve their sanitation conditions. The Project will carry out PHAP in\neach project town to ensure that the change of hygiene behavior will complement the improved\nwater supply and sanitation facilities. PPCs are required to provide early information to the\npublic on the need to increase tariff and availability of credit for water supply connection and\nsanitation improvement to low-income households.\n74. The CESI activities are aimed at maximizing the benefits of the Project. These activities\nhave previously proven to be a significant factor in deriving additional benefits, including (i)\nimproving the skills of WSCs and other local government organizations in communicating with\nthe  communities;  (ii)  improving  WSCs\u2019  understanding  of  their  customers  and  community\npreferences; (iii) greater openness and accountability of local governments; (iv) greater public\nparticipation in planning and decision making, leading to a higher level of ownership and public\nsupport for governments and WSCs; and (v) improving people's access to local authorities and\ncommunity networks.\nV.  PROJECT JUSTIFICATION\nA.  Economic and Financial Analyses\n1. Economic Analysis\n75. An economic analysis has been undertaken for each project town as well as the overall\nProject. The analysis is based on the forecasts of water production and sales and capital and\noperating costs used in the financial analysis. The economic analysis is carried out using\neconomic prices, derived from financial prices with adjustments for transfer payments including\ntaxes, duties, and subsidies, and for any other market distortions. The analysis of the water", "24\nsupply and sanitation subprojects in each of the seven project towns and the overall Project\nincludes the following: (i) least cost analysis of alternative water supply development options, (ii)\nderivation of the economic price\u2014the average incremental economic cost (AIEC) of water and\nwastewater services, (iii) calculation of the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of each\nsubproject and the overall Project, (iv) sensitivity analysis, (v) distribution analysis of project\nbenefits, and (vi) poverty impact analysis. The detailed economic analysis is presented in\nAppendix 9.\n76. The least cost analysis, where applicable, compares the expected capital and operating\ncosts of alternative development options. For each option, capital and operating cost streams\nwere compared and the net present values and AIEC calculated, using the social opportunity\ncost of capital (SOCC), assumed at 12 percent. The result indicates that the Project is the least\ncost option. The AIEC for the water supply and wastewater subproject provides a measure of\nthe  cost  per  cubic  meter  and  the  basis  of  tariffs  for  full  cost  recovery.  The  AIEC  is  the\ndiscounted value of incremental capital costs and operating costs (in economic prices) divided\nby the discounted volumes of incremental water sales as a result of the proposed investment.\nCapital  and  operating  costs  include  the  economic  cost  of  water,  sanitation,  and  drainage\ncomponents. The AIEC for the overall Project is estimated at D8,135/m3.\n77. The calculation of the EIRRs for water supply components is based on the capital and\nO&M costs of the least cost alternative, including the cost of public sanitation facilities and any\nenvironmental  degradation.  The  valuation  of  the  nonincremental  benefits  is  based  on  the\naverage supply price of all sources in the without-project situation. This is used as the proxy for\nconsumers\u2019 willingness to pay. These include water from tubewell supplies, surface wells, and\nriver sources as well as water purchased year-round or during the dry season from water\nvendors or from households with piped supply. The EIRR for the overall project is 17.7 percent.\nThe EIRR calculated for each project town ranges from 13.7 percent to 19.9 percent, all higher\nthan the SOCC. The sensitivity of the EIRRs of the water supply and sanitation components\nwas tested against adverse changes in key variables, and the EIRRs exceed the SOCC in all\ntests. The Project is most sensitive to delays in project completion, where a two-year delay will\ncause the average EIRR to decline to 14.4 percent.\n78. An analysis has been undertaken to measure the distribution of the project benefits to\ndifferent participants in the Project, including the government, WSC, consumers, and laborers.\nThe analysis shows that while the Project has an overall economic net present value of D431\nbillion, the benefits mainly go to the consumers and laborers. A poverty impact analysis has\nbeen carried out to estimate the proportion of benefits accruing to the poor. A poverty impact\nratio is derived by comparing the net economic benefits to the poor with the net economic\nbenefits to the economy as a whole. The overall poverty impact ratio for the Project is 34.7\npercent.\n2.  Financial Analysis\n79. The financial analysis is undertaken to assess the (i) financial viability of each subproject\nand  the  overall  Project,  by  comparing  the  financial  internal  rate  of  return  (FIRR)  with  the\nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) used to finance each subproject as well as the overall\nProject;  (ii)  adequate  tariffs  required  to  achieve  financial  sustainability  for  the  WSCs,  and\nsubsidies incurred, by comparing the average tariff with the average incremental financial cost", "25\n(AIFC); (iii) affordability of the proposed water tariffs; (iv) sensitivity of the FIRRs to adverse\nchanges in the key variables; and (v) financial projections for the WSCs.\na.  FIRR and AIFC\n80. The overall FIRR for the Project water supply component is 3.2 percent, which is above\nthe 2.0 percent WACC. Therefore, the Project is considered financially viable. The FIRRs for the\nindividual subprojects in the five provincial towns all exceed their WACCs and are, therefore,\nconsidered financially viable. While the FIRR for the district town Chi Thanh is below the WACC,\nwhen the three subprojects in Phu Yen Province (Chi Thanh, La Hai, Tuy Hoa) are considered\non a consolidated basis, the FIRR exceeds the WACC. Therefore, on a consolidated basis, the\nthree Phu Yen subprojects are considered to be financially viable. The overall AIFC, which is\nthe minimum tariff required for full cost recovery, for all project water supply components is\nD2,865/m3  of  water  sold.  For  the  individual  subprojects,  the  AIFC  ranges  from  a  low  of\nD2,790/m3 in Phan Rang to a high of D3,930/m3 in Chi Thanh. The cost of service in the district\ntowns  is  higher  than  that  for  the  provincial  towns  because  the  smaller  population  limits\neconomies of scale. The analysis is summarized in Table 8 and details are presented in\nAppendix 10.\nTable 8: Summary Results of the Financial Analysis\nSubproject FIRR WACC Average Water Tariff AIFC NPV\n(%) (%) (D/m3) (D/m3,\nRequiredb Actual 2000 Cons. prices) (D million)\nChi Thanh 0.0 1.8 3,460 1,897 3,930 -5,757\nLa Hai 2.5 1.8 3,460 1,897 3,300 1,533\nTuy Hoa 3.8 1.8 3,460 1,897 2,900 51,837\nPhu Yen Provincea 3.3 1.8 3,460 1,897 3,040 47,613\nPhan Rang 3.0 1.7 3,080 3,100 2,790 40,494\nRach Gia 3.0 2.7 3,060 2,405 2,980 6,330\nTay Ninh 2.6 2.2 3,240 2,076 3,140 4,386\nThu Dau Mot 3.4 3.0 3,145 2,665 3,000 14,775\n Total 3.2 2.0 NMc NMc 2,865 113,598\n(cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:6)(cid:7)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:10)(cid:11)(cid:12)(cid:8)(cid:10)(cid:13)(cid:12)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:12)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:15)(cid:1)(cid:10)(cid:16)(cid:1)(cid:8)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:13)(cid:6)(cid:17)(cid:10)(cid:16)(cid:18)(cid:1)(cid:19)(cid:10)b(cid:10)(cid:20)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:1)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:10)(cid:24)(cid:1)(cid:23)(cid:8)(cid:25)(cid:25)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:22)(cid:26)(cid:27)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:28)(cid:28)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:10)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:30)(cid:31)(cid:10)(cid:4)(cid:18)(cid:3)(cid:28)(cid:24)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:24)(cid:10)(cid:27)(cid:23)(cid:8)(cid:4)(cid:22)(cid:28)(cid:14)(cid:10)(cid:23)(cid:22) (cid:6)(cid:8)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:18)(cid:21)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:10)(cid:24)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:10)(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:30)(cid:31)!(cid:29)(cid:30)(cid:31)\"\n(cid:27)(cid:22)(cid:23)(cid:8)(cid:18)(cid:7)(cid:10)(cid:25)(cid:18)(cid:23)(cid:10)#$(cid:11)(cid:28)(cid:10)(cid:24)(cid:18)(cid:10)(cid:23)(cid:22)(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:12)(cid:10)(cid:24)(cid:12)(cid:22)(cid:10)(cid:25)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:4)(cid:8)(cid:1)(cid:5)(cid:10)(cid:24)(cid:1)(cid:23)(cid:9)(cid:22)(cid:24)(cid:28)(cid:19)(cid:10)c(cid:1)%&(cid:10)\u2019(cid:3)(cid:18)(cid:24)(cid:10)((cid:22)(cid:1)(cid:3)(cid:8)(cid:3)(cid:9)(cid:25)(cid:6)(cid:5))\nSource: WSCs documents and ADB estimates.\nb. Average Tariff Requirements, Affordability, and Willingness to Pay\n81. As shown in Table 8, the average tariff requirements for the project towns are relatively\nsimilar, ranging from a low of D3,060/m3 for Rach Gia to a high of D3,460/m3 for the three towns\nin Phu Yen province. These average tariff requirements are expressed on a constant price\nbasis. An affordability analysis has been undertaken to ensure that households, particularly\nthose low-income groups, comprising households earning an amount at or below the average of\nthe bottom 20th percentile of income distribution, can afford the proposed water tariffs. The\ntariffs are considered affordable if expenditure on water does not exceed 5 percent of household\nincome. The tariffs are considered affordable for the median income households in all of the\nproject towns over the 2002-2014 period. While the tariffs may appear high for the low-income\nhouseholds in La Hai during 2008-2010, this is partly a result of conservative assumption on the\ngrowth of their future incomes. Further, the piped water supply represents significant cost\nsavings compared with other alternatives. The results of this analysis are summarized in Table\n9.", "26\nTable 9: Affordability Analysis\nSubproject Town Percentage of Income to Pay Water Bill\n2002 2008 2010 2014\nChi Thanh\nMedian Income Household 2.2 3.7 3.7 3.4\nLow Income Household 3.1 4.7 4.6 3.9\nLa Hai\nMedian Income Household 2.8 4.8 4.8 4.4\nLow Income Household 4.4 6.6 6.4 5.4\nPhan Rang\nMedian Income Household 2.6 3.0 2.8 2.4\nLow Income Household 2.8 2.8 2.6 2.1\nRach Gia\nMedian Income Household 2.2 2.7 2.8 3.0\nLow Income Household 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.9\nTay Ninh\nMedian Income Household 2.3 2.9 3.0 3.1\nLow Income Household 2.6 2.7 2.7 2.5\nThu Dau Mot\nMedian Income Household 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.5\nLow Income Household 1.8 1.6 1.5 1.3\nTuy Hoa\nMedian Income Household 1.6 2.6 2.7 2.4\nLow Income Household 1.7 2.5 2.4 2.1\n    Source: ADB estimates.\n82. An  assessment  of  the  willingness  of  consumers  to  pay  the  tariffs  has  also  been\nundertaken on the basis of the socioeconomic survey carried out during the Project feasibility\nstudy. In general, for households presently connected to piped water supply, the willingness to\npay was higher than those not connected. In Rach Gia, Thu Dau Mot, and Tuy Hoa the\nproposed tariffs for 2002 are generally within the existing willingness to pay for households\npresently having piped water connections. For the other towns, tariff requirements in 2002\nexceed the willingness to pay by about 30 percent (Tay Ninh) to 100 percent (Chi Thanh, La\nHai, Phan Rang). For those not presently connected, the projected tariff requirements exceed\nthe existing willingness to pay in all towns.\n83. The survey results likely underestimate the willingness to pay. In Phan Rang and Tay\nNinh, current water bills for a typical household exceed the reported willingness to pay for those\nconnected to the system and yet there appears to be little resistance to payment. Willingness to\npay is also a function of present levels of service, which are low in all of the towns. For those not\npresently connected to the piped water supply system, it was observed during the socioeconomic\nsurvey that households often had difficulty estimating the total cost of their nonpiped water supply\nand, therefore, their willingness to pay for piped water. This indicates the importance of the PHAP,\nwhich is expected to increase the awareness of the households of the value of piped water\nsupply.\nc.  Sensitivity Analysis\n84. The sensitivity of the FIRRs is tested against adverse changes in selected key variables:\n(i) increases in capital costs, (ii) increases in O&M costs, (iii) reductions in revenues, (iv)\nreductions in savings from lower UFW; (v) reduction in projected number of water connections,\nand (vi) delays in the completion of the subproject. The FIRR is most sensitive to a reduction in\nincremental revenues derived from the water tariffs. These are presented in Table 10.", "27\nTable 10: FIRR Sensitivity Analysis\nKey Variable Change FIRR SIa SVb\nBase Case 3.16\n1. Capital Cost +10 2.33 2.63 +14.3\n2.

Financial Projections of WSCs\n85. Financial projections have been prepared for each of the five WSCs in order to assess\nthe impact of the proposed Project on the financial viability and sustainability of the companies.\nThe financial projections are based on the key financial performance objectives set for the\nWSCs over the projection period: (i) generating revenues sufficient to cover all cash O&M\nexpenses and depreciation expense or debt repayment (whichever is greater), and a net income\nsufficient to cover bonus and welfare fund contributions; (ii) maintaining a cash balance at the\nend of each year equivalent to no less than 30 days worth of annual cash O&M expenditures\nplus debt service; (iii) maintaining a current ratio at no less than 1.0 as of the end of each year;\nand (iv) improving the financial positions to self-finance an increasing proportion of the annual\ncapital expenditure requirements.\n86. The financial performance of the WSCs improves over the 2000\u20132014 forecast period\nwith the increase of water tariffs. However, due to the need for the phased implementation of\nthe tariff increases and because of the impact of debt service obligations for the subprojects, all\nof the WSCs will experience short-term periods of weaker performance. With the exception of\nthe Kien Giang WSC, the WSCs are not expected to achieve the financial objectives set out\nabove in all years. However, the overall financial performance and position of the WSCs is\nexpected to be sufficient to maintain adequate levels of cash during all periods. Therefore, the\nprojected  financial  performance  of  the  WSCs  is  considered  satisfactory.  Key  performance\nindicators are shown in Table 11.\ne.  Subsidies\n87. Water tariffs in the project towns are substantially below the full cost recovery levels. To\nsupport the Government policy of gradually reducing the subsidies to the water supply sector\nand achieving full cost recovery from beneficiaries, the Project will require PPCs under the\nProject to substantially increase water tariffs during 2004-2008. Further, the Project intends to\nmake transparent the cross subsidies between the different revenue sources within a WSC.\nWSCs are required to establish separate accounting for costs and revenues from water sales\nand those from other sources, such as construction. To enable the low-income households to\nhave private connections to the piped water supply, the WSCs will allow these households to\npay the cost of house connection by installments. There is a hidden interest subsidy. Under the\nproposed sanitation credit schemes, the lending rate will be the same as those offered by the\nBank for the Poor, which is lower than the prevailing market rates, reflecting a subsidy in the\ncost  of  funds  to  the  low-income  households.  This  is  deemed  acceptable  considering  the", "28\naffordability  of  low-income  households,  their  need  for  improved  living  conditions,  and  the\nassociated positive externalities.\nTable 11: Key Performance Indicators of WSCs\n2001 2008 2014\n Binh Duong WSDC\nWater Sales (m3/d)       12,400     33,600     56,100\nCash Balance (D million)         6,400     23,300     55,100\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)           168         131         204\nCurrent Ratio            1.2          3.0          6.9\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%) 75 87 61\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual 3 788 124\n Kien Giang WSDC\nWater Sales (m3/d)       12,400     26,700     38,200\nCash Balance (D million)         6,100     35,300     75,500\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)           262         339         401\nCurrent Ratio            6.2          6.9          9.6\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%) 18 51 34\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual 22 451 140\n Ninh Thuan WSC\nWater Sales (m3/d)         5,500     13,700     38,200\nCash Balance (D million)         3,800     11,800     35,400\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)           350         126         191\nCurrent Ratio          20.2          1.8          3.5\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%) 0 156 93\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual NA 164 296\n Phu Yen WSC\nWater Sales (m3/d)         5,800     12,700     26,700\nCash Balance (D million)         3,600     17,500     48,600\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)           471         207         378\nCurrent Ratio            9.5          2.1          4.4\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%) 0 113 80\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual 6 501 297\n Tay Ninh WSDC\nWater Sales (m3/d)         4,400      9,700     16,200\nCash Balance (D million)         1,300     11,100     19,900\nCash (Days Worth of Cash Obligations)           215         249         283\nCurrent Ratio          26.3          3.7          5.9\nDebt - Equity Ratio (%) 19 97 64\nSelf Financing Ratio (%) - Annual 7 619 150\nm3/d = cubic meter per day\nSource:  ADB estimates.\nB.  Environment\n88. The water sources of most Project towns are of good quality and sufficient yield, while\nthose of Rach Gia suffer from saline intrusion during dry season and of Chi Thanh from organic\npollution resulting from agricultural and animal wastes. The raw water reservoir in Rach Gia and\nborefield in Chi Thanh will provide raw water of better quality, reduce the potential for pollution,\nand  minimize  water  treatment  costs.  The  Project  is  designed  to  deliver  24-hour,  fully\npressurized water supply systems, and thereby ensure the supply of safe drinking water by\neliminating the risk of contamination of the water supply from groundwater infiltration under low\npressure or vacuum condition. Higher supply pressures will also improve fire-fighting capabilities\nin the towns and reduce the cost of fire damage to buildings and property.", "29\n89. The project towns have combined drainage systems that carry both storm water and\nwastewater. However the coverage of drainage systems is limited and their functions are less\nthan  satisfactory  due  to  poor  design  and  maintenance.  The  systems  will  be  cleaned  and\nrehabilitated where necessary, and sewage pipes installed in high and medium density areas to\nsupplement septic tanks and existing drains. In low-density areas, where adequate drains do\nnot  exist,  septic  tank  effluent  and  sewage  will  be  discharged  to  soakaways.  Septic  tank\ncoverage will be raised through regulations, public health awareness programs, and sanitation\ncredit schemes. Sanitation improvements will also be carried out in schools and public areas\nsuch as markets.\n90. The groundwater in some project areas is contaminated by pit latrines, septic tanks, and\ndrainage  systems.  While  expanding  the  piped  water  supply  system  and  sanitation\nimprovements will not eliminate groundwater contamination, it will prevent further contamination\nof groundwater and improve its quality over time. In Thu Dau Mot, excessive exploitation of\ngroundwater  has  substantially  lowered  the  groundwater  table,  and  saline  intrusion  in  both\nsurface water and groundwater is a problem in Rach Gia and Tuy Hoa. Improved piped water\nsupply systems will reduce dependence on contaminated water sources, and minimize the\npotential for further lowering of water tables and salination of groundwater. Greater coverage of\nseptic tanks, drainage improvements, and adoption of proper standards for septic tanks and\nsoakaways  will  also  help  to  reduce  groundwater  contamination.  The  summary  initial\nenvironmental examination is presented in Appendix 11.\nC.  Social Dimensions and Impact on Poverty\n91. Participatory methods, such as workshops, rapid assessment, focus groups discussions,\nand surveys, have been employed in formulating the Project throughout the feasibility study, to\nensure that the needs and demands of the weaker social groups, such as women, ethnic\nminorities, and the poor, will be taken into consideration. During project implementation, WSCs\nwill be trained in community consultation techniques, analysis of customer feedback, and other\nareas  to  improve  participation.  The  public  health  awareness  programs,  the  community\nenvironmental sanitation improvement programs, and the sanitation credit schemes will all use\nparticipatory approaches. Women will benefit from increased knowledge of safe water practices,\npersonal  hygiene,  and  awareness  of  the  linkage  between  water,  sanitation,  and  health.\nConveniently available safe water will reduce the time spent by women on collecting water or\ncaring for other household members who are ill from unsafe water or poor hygiene, allowing\nthem to spend more time on improving their living conditions. Increased interaction with the\nVMU and other agencies will enhance their social contacts and reduce isolation.\n92. The Project will have significant and positive impacts on the poor. Access to piped water\nwill significantly reduce the time and cost of the poor in collecting and storing water. The poor\noften walk or cycle long distances (400\u20131,000 meters) daily or more to collect water for drinking\nif they have no safe and reliable source nearby, or when existing wells are dried up, become\nsaline during the dry season, or are contaminated by flood water during the wet season. Piped\nwater  availability  will  result  in  increased  water  purchasing  power  for  the  same  household\nbudget. Greater use of piped water (including for washing dishes, bathing, and washing clothes)\nwill improve health and reduce risk of infection or illness from polluted sources, and increase the\ntime available for income generating, education, and health care. The sanitation credit schemes\nand water connection credits to poor households will help them improve their living conditions\nand reduce the risk of illness and incapacity. Other positive social impacts include (i) improving\nWSCs'  understanding  of  their  customers'  and  communities'  needs  and  preferences;  (ii)\nimproving WSCs\u2019 communication skills in consulting the communities; (iii) greater openness and", "30\naccountability of local governments; (iv) greater public participation in decision making and\nplanning, leading to a high level of ownership and increased public support for the Project; (v)\nincreased  cooperation  between  authorities  from  different  sectors  e.g.,  health,  education,\ncommunity, town administration, and water supply. A summary social analysis is presented in\nAppendix 12.\nD. Risks\n93. The main risks related to the Project are (i) inadequate capacity of the PPCs and WSCs\nfor implementing the Project; (ii) failure of WSCs to collect adequate tariffs to cover the O&M\ncost  and  debt  service  payments;  and  (iii)  inadequate  maintenance,  affecting  long-term\nsustainability  of  the  completed  project  infrastructure.  The  limited  capacity  of  provincial\norganizations  could  lead  to  delays  and  additional  costs.  None  of  the  five  provinces  have\nexperience with projects financed by multilateral aid agencies. The staff at WSCs and other\nprovincial-level  agencies  generally  lack  knowledge  of  ADB  procedures  and  the  skills  to\nimplement the Project. To mitigate this risk, the Project will provide adequate initial training on\nproject management, and will require that PPCs and WSCs ensure that skilled personnel and\nother resources are available in the province for the Project.\n94. The key risks to the financial sustainability of the WSCs are uncertainty regarding tariff\nrevenues and the number of water supply connections. Adequate tariff is particularly important\nover the 2008\u20132010 period when the WSCs are expected to commence debt service on the\nProject. PPCs are required to conduct public education on cost recovery and tariff increases. It\nis equally important that new customers be connected to the system as rapidly as possible. The\npublic health awareness program will be essential in encouraging households to connect to the\npiped water supply system.\n95. A major risk to the Project could stem from inadequate maintenance of the rehabilitated\nand new facilities. The Project will assist the WSCs to conduct asset inventories and prepare\nO&M  plans  and  guidelines  based  on  appropriate  engineering  practice.  These  plans  and\nguidelines will be used by WSCs to ensure adequate budgetary allocation for proper preventive\nmaintenance. O&M equipment provided under the Project and staff training will also assist the\nWSCs to ensure the sustainability of the water and sanitation systems.\nVI.  ASSURANCES\nA.

Each\ninventory will include (i) baseline information; (ii) detailed compensation and other rehabilitation\nentitlements for each AP; (iii) location, area, and category of the replacement residential and\nagricultural land to be provided, if applicable; (iv) a time-bound action plan for implementation;\nand (v) a detailed budget and source of funding for the various compensation and rehabilitation\nmeasures. The baseline information for the RP will be completed one month prior to issuance of\nbid invitation for water supply contracts in each province. Specifically, the inventory will include:\n(i)  number of people and main occupation and level of income;\n(ii)  number, type, and area of the house acquired;\n(iii)  number and area of residential plot acquired;\n(iv)  number, category, and area of agricultural land acquired;\n(v)  quantity and types of crops and trees acquired;\n(vi)  quantity and category of other fixed assets affected by the Project; and\n(vii)  temporary damage to productive assets.\nC. Socioeconomic Survey\n4. A socioeconomic survey has been conducted among APs. The RP for each provincial\nproject management unit (PPMU) includes summary findings of the baseline socioeconomic", "52\nAppendix 7, page 2\nsurvey based on a representative sample of affected households. It describes AP occupations,\nsources of income, and educational levels.\nD. Poverty Alleviation Issues\n5. The number of displaced people is small and the degree of impact on other APs is\nminor. Consequently, it was not appropriate to have special income restoration measures.\nNonetheless, all households will be closely monitored to ensure their livelihoods are adequately\nrestored as quickly as possible. Based on the results of monitoring for any household facing\neconomic difficulties, the spell (PPC) will identify and take mitigation actions to resolve the\nproblem. In some provinces, WSCs may offer direct employment.\nE. Legal Framework\n6. The legal framework governing the implementation of RPs is Article 27 of the 1993 Land\nLaw  and  Decree  No.  22/1998/ND-CP.  The  Land  Law  of  1993,  a  comprehensive  land\nadministration  law,  states  that  land  belongs  to  the  people,  with  the  state  as  its  sole\nadministrator,  reserving  the  right  to  allocate  land  and  determine  its  usage.  Families  and\nindividuals who have been allocated land have the right to exchange their land, transfer the use\nrights to others, rent the land for a period of three years, bequeath it, or use it as collateral.\nDecree No. 22 of 1998 sets out the policy and regulations governing compensation for damage\nwhen the state recovers land for public purposes. It defines the persons entitled to receive\ncompensation,  the  method  of  calculating  compensation  for  land  and  for  property  damage,\nprovisions for temporary relocation, and support for permanent relocation. The decree also\noutlines  the  requirements  for  setting  up  resettlement  areas;  defines  the  responsibilities  of\ncentral, provincial, and town level institutions for assessment and payment of compensation;\nand confirms the right of complaint for APs and the procedure for complaint resolution.\nF. Resettlement Policy and Compensation Standards\n7. A  project-specific  resettlement  policy  has  been  developed  and  is  similar  for  each\nprovince. The RPs include summary details of the number and categories of APs, losses and\ncompensation  entitlements  as  negotiated  and  agreed  with  APs,  and  details  of  community\nconsultations conducted. The specific compensation rates have been established and approved\nby  each  PPC.  APs  are  entitled  to  the  following  types  of  compensation  and  rehabilitation\nmeasures:  compensation  for  loss  of  property,  land,  and  nonfarm  commercial income;  and\nrehabilitation measures. Procedures for determining compensation and rehabilitation measures\nare substantially in accordance with Decree No. 22/ND-CP.\nG. Organizational Arrangements\n8. The overall responsibility for enforcement of the resettlement policy rests with the PPC.\nIn  coordination  with  the  town  people\u2019s  committees  (TPC)  and  district  people\u2019s  committees\n(DPC),  each  WSC  is  responsible  for  preparing  inventories  and  resettlement  plans  for\nimplementation within their jurisdiction. The ward people\u2019s committees (WPCs) and commune\npeople\u2019s committees (CPCs) will ensure the active and effective participation of APs in the\npreparation of the inventories and implementation of the resettlement plans. The PPCs will\nprovide the funds necessary to implement these based on budgets established by the DPCs\nand TPCs. The WSCs will be responsible for implementing the RPs, under the direction of the\nPPCs. All WSCs and PPCs and some of the TPCs and DPCs, have recent experience in land\nacquisition and resettlement.", "53\nAppendix 7, page 3\nH. Consultation, Information Disclosure, and Grievance Procedures\n9. WSCs have held public consultations with APs, providing full information concerning the\nprovisions of the resettlement policy framework and the opportunity to voice concerns. Prior to\npayment, local government officials will ensure that each AP household has been fully informed\nby WSCs of their entitlements and rehabilitation choices. Complaints and grievances related to\nany aspect of the inventories and RPs, including the area to be acquired and the price of assets\nlost, will be handled as follows, with APs exempted from all administrative and legal fees:\n(i)  APs will present their complaints and grievances to the WPC or CPC (or to a\nspecially  established  resettlement  committee),  which  will  have  to  provide  a\nwritten response to the AP within 15 calendar days of receiving the complaint.\n(ii)  If not satisfied with the decision of the WPC or CPC, the AP may present the\ncase to the DPC or TPC within 15 days of receiving a written response from the\nWPC or CPC.\n(iii)  If not satisfied with the decision of the DPC or TPC, the AP can appeal to the\nPPC.\n(iv)  If the AP is not satisfied with the decision of the PPC, the case may be submitted\nfor consideration to the district court.\nI.  Cost Estimates\n10. The RPs for the PPMUs contain detailed costs of compensation and other rehabilitation\nentitlements and relocation costs of APs, with a breakdown by agricultural land, residential land,\nstructures,  and  other  assets.  The  cost  estimates  have  made  adequate  provision  for\ncontingencies.\nJ.  Monitoring and Evaluation\n11. Implementation of the Resettlement Plans will be regularly supervised and monitored by\nthe  PPMU  in  coordination  with  the  people\u2019s  committees.  The  findings  will  be  recorded  in\nquarterly reports to be furnished to the provincial steering committees (PSCs) and the (ADB),\nthrough the project coordination unit at the central level. An independent agency or agencies will\nbe engaged to periodically carry out external monitoring and evaluation of the inventories and\nimplementation of the resettlement plans. The independent monitor(s) will be academic or\nresearch  institutes,  nongovernment  organizations,  or  independent  consulting  firms,  all  with\nqualified  and  experienced  staff  and  terms  of  reference  acceptable  to  ADB.  The  external\nmonitoring agency will provide the PSCs with a monitoring and evaluation report every six\nmonths until the completion of all resettlement, and then a final evaluation report one year later.\nADB will also conduct regular supervision to ensure that the provinces are in compliance with\nthe agreed resettlement policy. Monitoring and evaluation will\n(i)  determine  whether  procedures  for  delivery  of  compensation  and  other\nrehabilitation entitlements have been done in accordance with the RPs;\n(ii)  assess if the objective of at least restoration of living standards and income\nlevels of APs has been met;\n(iii)  gather  qualitative  indications  of  the  social  and  economic  impact  of  project\nimplementation on the APs; and\n(iv)  suggest mitigating measures and modification in the implementation procedures\nof the RPs to achieve the principles and objectives of the ADB resettlement\npolicy.", "54 Appendix 8, page 1\nMONITORING AND EVALUATION INDICATORS\nObjective Activity Indicator Monitoring\nMechanism\nA.

Introduction\n1. An economic analysis for the Project has been undertaken, based on projected water sales\nand capital and operating costs in the financial analysis, adjusted for market distortions and\ntransfer payments including taxes, duties, or subsidies. The analysis includes the following: (i) least\ncost analysis of alternative water supply project options; (ii) derivation of the economic price\u2014\naverage incremental economic cost (AIEC) of water and wastewater services; (iii) calculation of the\neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) and net present value (NPV) for each subproject and the\noverall Project; (iv) sensitivity analysis; (v) distribution analysis of project benefits; and (vi) poverty\nimpact analysis.\nB.  Economic Cost of Water\n2. The AIEC for the water supply (and wastewater) subprojects provides a measure of the\neconomic cost of water per cubic meter (m3) of the Project. The AIEC is the discounted value of\nincremental capital costs and operating costs (in economic prices) divided by the discounted\nquantity of incremental water sales as a result of the Project. The discount rate used is the social\nopportunity cost of capital (SOCC) assumed at 12 percent. The AIEC ranges from D7,095/m3 for\nLa Hai to D9,160/ m3 for Tay Ninh and an overall average of D8,135/m3.\nC.  Economic Rate of Return\n3. The EIRRs for water supply subprojects are based on the least cost alternatives including\nthe cost of public sanitation facilities and any environmental degradation. The valuation of the\nnonincremental benefits is based on the average supply price of all sources in the without-Project\nsituation,  which  is  made  up  of  water  from  tubewell,  surface  wells,  rivers,  water  vendors,  or\nhouseholds with piped supply. Incremental sales are valued at the proposed financial tariffs. The\nEIRR for the overall project is 17.7 percent. The EIRR calculated for the water supply component\nin each project town and the overall Project, together with the net present value (NPV) are\nsummarized in Table A9.1. EIRRs of all the subprojects and the overall Project exceed the SOCC\nof 12 percent.\nTable A9.1: Summary of EIRR of Projects Replace with Revised Table and Notes\nWSC Town NPV (D million) EIRR (%) AIEC (D/m3)\nBinh Duong Thu Dau Mot 153,451 19.0 8,630\nKen Giang Rach Gia 147,462 19.9 7,579\nNinh Thuan Phan Rang 36,549 15.4 7,692\nPhu Yen Chi Thanh 63,886 16.8 7,920\nPhu Yen La Hai 14,979 18.8 7,095\nPhu Yen Tuy Hoa 2,753 14.2 8,564\nTay Ninh Tay Ninh 12,224 13.7 9,160\nOverall Project   431,305 17.7 8,135\nNotes: (i) taxes and duties deducted, tradable inputs adjusted by the shadow exchange rate factor of 1.11, and unskilled\nlabor assumes a shadow wage rate factor of 0.65; (ii) nonincremental sales\u2014domestic and institutional benefit valued at\neconomic value of non-piped water, incremental sales\u2014valued at the proposed financial tariffs; (iii) Tuy Hoa: assume in\nwithout-Project case a 20 percent decrease in water production from existing 7,000 m3/d; (iv) Chi Thanh: assume existing\nsystem collapses, and in with-Project case, benefiting additional 800 m3/d; (v) Tay Ninh: assume existing production of\n500 m3/d ceases in without-Project situation; (vi) 50% of UFW assumed to be consumed as nontechnical losses; (viii)\nwillingness to pay for connection averages D400,000 per new connection.", "59 Appendix 9, page 2\nD.  Sensitivity Analysis\n4. The sensitivity of the EIRR for each subproject and the weighted average EIRR of the overall\nProject was tested against adverse changes in key variables: (i) increases in capital costs; (ii)\nincreases in operating and maintenance (O&M) costs; (iii) reductions in revenues; (iv) reductions in\nwillingness to pay (expressed in terms of resource cost savings); (v) a reduction in the projected\nnumber of new water connections attributable to the subproject; and (vi) delays in the completion of\nsubproject construction. In the case of reduced number of connections, there is a corresponding\nreduction in capital and operating costs. Table A9.2 shows that the Project is most sensitive to delays\nin project completion. However, the project EIRR exceeds the SOCC under all tests. Since the\nprojected sales are mainly derived from the suppressed demand for water from existing consumers,\nchanges in the rate of population growth have little impact on the EIRR. Similarly, changes in level of\nunaccounted for water had only a very minor impact on the EIRR.\nTable A9.2: Summary of Project Sensitivity  Analyses\nKEY VARIABLE EIRR % SI % SV %\nOverall Project\nBase case 17.7\n1.

Benefits Distribution and Poverty Impact Analyses\n5. The following beneficiaries can be identified in the Project: (i) consumers, who will benefit\nfrom the lower cost of water and the increase in consumption, as well as from the economic value\nof  nontechnical  losses  consumed;  (ii)  the  Government  and  economy,  which  will  lose  where", "61 Appendix 9, page 4\neconomic costs exceed financial costs; (iii) labor, which will gain where the financial cost of labor\nexceeds its opportunity cost, both in the construction and operation phase of the project; (iv) the\nwater supply company (WSC), which will lose because financial tariffs/revenues are less than\neconomic benefits. The gains and losses to different participants in the Project are determined by\nthe  difference  between  financial  and  economic  benefits  and  costs  (at  a  discount  rate  of  12\npercent). These gains and losses in part compensate for each other with the net gain being\npositive and equal to the economic NPV, which is D431 billion for the overall Project. While the\nWSC and economy lose from the Project (where tariffs are less than economic benefits), labor and\nconsumers gain. Distribution of benefits for the overall project is shown in Table A9.3.\nTable A9.3: Distribution of Net Economic Benefits\n(D million)\nItem Financial Economic Economic Distribution of Project Benefits\n  Present Present less\n   Values Values Financial Utility Economy Labor Consumers Total\nTotal Benefits 329,883 1,252,199 922,316 922,316 922,316\nCapital Costs 705,135 723,575 18,440 -32,740 14,300 -18,440\nOperating costs 91,111 97,318 6,207 -7,760 1,553 -6,207\nTotal costs 796,247 820,894 24,647\nNet Benefits -466,364 431,305 897,669 -466,364 -466,364\nGains/Losses       -46,6364 -40,500 15,853 922,316 431,305\nPercentage of the Poor 12.6 12.6 75.0 21.9\nGains/Losses to the Poor -58,762 -5,103 11,890 201,760 149,785\nNote: Proportion of poor/vulnerable in project area is about 20 percent; Proportion of gross domestic product received by\nthe poor is estimated at 12.6 percent; 75 percent of the gains by labor goes to unskilled labor (poor); and an average of\n21.9 percent of new connections are from the poor.\n6.

Financial Analysis\n1. Objectives and Scope of Analysis: The financial analysis is undertaken to ensure that\neach  subproject  and  the  overall  Project  generate  revenues  sufficient  to  cover  capital  and\noperation costs and with a rate of return that meets or exceeds the weighted average cost of\ncapital (WACC) used to finance each subproject. This rate of return is expressed on the basis of\nthe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) defined as the discount rate equalizing the present\nvalue of incremental subproject costs to the present value of incremental revenues. Each\nsubproject is considered to be financially viable if the FIRR is equal to or greater than the\nWACC. To identify factors posing the greatest risk to the financial viability of each subproject,\nthe sensitivity of FIRR to adverse changes in selected key variables is analyzed. The average\nwater tariff required to achieve full cost recovery for the water supply components is estimated\nby calculating the average incremental financial cost (AIFC). The AIFC is defined as the present\nvalue of capital and operation costs divided by the present value of the volume of water sold\neach year over the life of the subproject, both discounted with the WACC. The AIFC is the\nminimum tariff required for full cost recovery. When the AIFC is higher than the actual average\ntariff, the difference represents a financial subsidy to water consumers from the water supply\ncompany (WSC).\n2. Major Assumptions: The major assumptions employed in the financial analysis are: (i)\nthe FIRR and AIFC are calculated over the 32 year period, from 2001 to 2032; (ii) all revenues\nand costs are expressed in local currency on an incremental basis in constant January 2001\nprices; (iii) the overall WACC for the Project is estimated to be 2.0 percent, the WACC varies\nslightly  between  subprojects  because  of  differences  in  the  proportion  of  debt  and  equity\ncontributions by the central and provincial governments and project beneficiaries; (iv) reduction\nin unaccounted for water (UFW) is included in calculating the FIRR; and (v) the projected\nincremental  revenues  attributable  to  each  subproject  are  calculated  as  the  projected\nincremental volume of water sold multiplied by the average water tariff, less an allowance for\nbad debts.\n3. FIRR and AIFC: The results of the analysis are presented in Table A10.1. The overall\nFIRR for the water supply component is 3.2 percent, which is above the 2.0 percent WACC.\nTherefore, the Project is considered to be financially viable. The FIRRs of the subprojects in all\nthe project towns exceed their WACCs except for Chi Thanh, where FIRR is slightly below the\nWACC. However, when the three subprojects in Phu Yen Province (Chi Tanh, La Hai, Tuy Hoa)\nare considered on a consolidated basis, the FIRR exceeds the WACC. As shown in Table\nA10.1, the average tariff requirements for the subprojects are relatively similar, ranging from a\nlow of D3,060 per cubic meter (m3) for Rach Gia to a high of D3,460/m3 for the three Phu Yen\ntowns. These average tariff requirements are expressed on a constant price basis.\n4. Compared with the existing average tariffs, the largest required tariff increase is in Phu\nYen (82 percent). The overall AIFC is D2,865/m3 of water sold. For the individual subprojects,\nthe AIFC ranges from a low of D2,790/m3 in Phan Rang to a high of D3,930/m3 in Chi Thanh.\nThe cost of service in the district towns is higher than that for the provincial towns because the\nsmaller service area limits economies of scale. The FIRRs for the subprojects in the two district\ntowns in Phu Yen Province are calculated on the basis that the same water tariff structure and\nlevels are applied by the provincial WSC in each subproject town.", "63 Appendix 10, page 2\nTable A10.1 \u2013 Summary Results of Financial Analysis\nSubproject FIRR WACC Average Water Tariff AIFC NPV\n(%) (%) (D/m3) (D/m3) D million\nRequiredb Actual 2000 Constant Prices\nChi Thanh 0.0 1.8 3,460 1,897 3,930 (5,757)\nLa Hai 2.5 1.8 3,460 1,897 3,300 1,533\nTuy Hoa 3.8 1.8 3,460 1,897 2,900 51,837\nPhu Yen Provincea 3.3 1.8 3,460 1,897 3,040 47,613\nPhan Rang 3.0 1.7 3,080 3,100 2,790 40,494\nRach Gia 3.0 2.7 3,060 2,405 2,980 6,330\nTay Ninh 2.6 2.2 3,240 2,076 3,140 4,386\nThu Dau Mot 3.4 3.0 3,145 2,665 3,000 14,775\nTotal Project 3.2 2.0 NMc NMc 2,865 113,598\na Including Chi Thanh, La Hai, and Tuy Hoa; b Average tariff, expressed in 2001 constant prices, required over the\n2001\u20132014 period for WSCs to reach the financial targets. c NM =not meaningful.\nSource: WSCs documents and ADB estimates.\n5. Sensitivity  Analysis:  The  sensitivity  of  each  subproject  FIRR  is  analyzed  to  the\nfollowing  adverse  changes:  (i)  increases  in  capital  costs;  (ii)  increases  in  operating  and\nmaintenance (O&M) costs, (iii) reductions in revenues, (iv) reductions in savings from NRW, (v)\na reduction in the projected number of new water connections attributable to the subproject, and\n(vi) delays in subproject construction. The FIRR is most sensitive to a reduction in incremental\nrevenues derived from the water tariffs. Tariff revenues may be lower than that forecast as a\nresult of a failure to increase tariffs to the proposed levels, which may arise from a limited\nwillingness to pay and/or a lower rate of connection to the piped water system than assumed.\nThe impact of a reduced rate of population growth on the FIRR was also assessed. However,\nsince  the  focus  of  the  Project  is  on  satisfying  the  unmet  demand  for  water  from  existing\nconsumers, changes in the rate of population growth will have little or no impact on the FIRR.\nThe detailed results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Table A10.2.\nTable 10.2: FIRR Sensitivity Analysis\nKey Variable Change (%) FIRR (%) SI SV (%)\nTotal Project\nBase Case 3.16\n1.

Financial Performance of Project Water Supply Companies\n6. Objectives and Scope of Analysis: Financial projections have been prepared for each\nWSC to assess the impact of each subproject on the financial viability and sustainability of the\ncompanies. The projections are based on the implementation of the water tariffs employed in\nthe FIRR analysis and the estimated total operating, maintenance and capital expenditure\nrequirements of the WSCs during 2000\u20132014. The financial projections incorporate only the\nwater  supply  operations  of  the  WSCs.  Therefore,  revenues  and  expenditures  earned  and\nincurred by the WSCs\u2019 construction services units are excluded.\n7. Financial Targets: The preparation of the financial projections is based on a number of\nkey financial targets set for the WSCs. The WSCs\u2019 ability to achieve these targets is then used\nas the basis for assessing the financial impact of each subproject on the WSCs and their\ncapability to operate on a financially sustainable basis. These targets, particularly as they apply\nto each individual year, should not be regarded as absolute requirements. The targets are: (i)", "65 Appendix 10, page 4\neach WSC should generate revenues in each year that are sufficient to cover all cash O&M\nexpenses, including those for management and administration, depreciation or debt repayment,\nwhichever is greater, all interest expense on debt, and a net income sufficient to cover normal\nobligations relating to bonus and welfare fund contributions; (ii) each WSC should hold at the\nend of each year over the forecast period a cash balance equivalent to no less than 30 days\nworth of annual cash O&M expenditures plus debt service; (iii) each WSC should maintain its\ncurrent ratio (current assets divided by current liabilities) at no less than 1.0 as of the end of\neach year over the forecast period; and (iv) over the forecast period, the financial position of\neach WSC should improve so that it is able to self-finance an increasing proportion of its annual\ncapital expenditure requirements.\n8. Major Assumptions: The major assumptions employed in the financial analysis are: (i)\nthe financial projections include all revenues and costs incurred by each WSC over the 2000\u2013\n2014 forecast period; (ii) Projected capital costs, operating revenues, and operating expenses\nare presented in local currency and expressed in current prices; (iii) annual operating revenues\nfor each WSC are calculated on the basis of the total volume of water billed in each year by\neach customer group (residential, institutional, industrial, commercial) and the average water\ntariff for each customer group; (iv) direct O&M costs include the following expense line items: (a)\nlabor, (b) electricity, (c) materials and supplies, (d) maintenance, and (e) other expenses, and\nmanagement and administration expenses are estimated by the following specific line items: (a)\nlabor, (b) sales expense, and (c) other expenses; and (v) consistent with Ministry of Finance\n(MOF) regulations, depreciation expense is calculated on a straight line basis on the original\ncost of average gross fixed assets in operation.\n9. Projected Financial Performance: A summary of the financial projections for WSCs is\npresented in tables A10.3 and A10.4. The financial performance of the WSCs improves during\n2000\u20132014  due  to  increases  in  tariffs  and  water  sales  with  the  commissioning  of  the\nsubprojects. However, due to the need for the phased implementation of the tariff increases and\nbecause of the shorter term impact of the debt service obligations for the subprojects, all of the\nWSCs will experience short-term weaker performance. With the exception of the Kien Giang\nWSC, the WSCs are not expected to achieve the financial targets set out above in all years.\nHowever,  the  overall  financial  performance  and  position  of  the  WSCs  is  expected  to  be\nsufficient to maintain adequate levels of cash during these periods of weaker performance, and\ntherefore is considered satisfactory.\n10. During 2002\u20132006, the WSCs need to implement tariff increases to recover the full cost\nof existing water supply services, and eliminate their existing reliance on indirect subsidies from\nthe construction services. Since the tariff increases need to be phased in over a number of\nyears, four of the five WSCs are anticipated to incur net losses in at least one year during this\nphase-in  period.  Over  the  period  of  2007-2009,  with  the  commencement  of  subproject\noperations  in  2008,  there  is  a  large  and  immediate  increase  in  depreciation  and  interest\nexpense on debt. However, the growth in water sales is spread out over a 3\u20136 year period as\nnew customers are progressively connected to the system. Consequently, financial performance\nis expected to weaken over the 2008\u20132010 period. As shown in Table A10.3, three of the five\nWSCs are projected to incur net losses in 2008. All of the WSCs, except the Kien Giang WSC,\nare expected to incur a net loss in 2009. Over the period 2010\u20132014, the WSCs\u2019 financial\nperformance is projected to progressively improve. Given that the recommended tariff increases\nare implemented, all of the WSCs will be able to generate a positive net income in each year of\nthe period.

Tariff Requirements\n11. Tariff Requirements: Tariff increases will be implemented every two years beginning in\n2002. Recommended tariff structures and levels have been developed and are shown in Table\nA10.5 for 2002\u20132008. The recommended tariff levels for each customer group are indicative\nonly. Actual tariffs for each group depend on the distribution of consumption, both between the\ncustomer  groups  as  well  as  within  the  residential  group.  The  existing  tariff  structure  for\nnonresidential customers will be maintained, but with progressively higher tariff levels being\napplied over the 2002\u20132014 period, and the institutional, industrial, and commercial water users\nwill pay a flat tariff for all consumption. The lifeline consumption block, covering the first 8\nm3/month, will be priced at 80 percent of the main residential block for consumption between 8\nm3 and 16 m3. A third consumption block will cover consumption between 16 m3 and 25 m3 and\nbe priced at 1.25 of the main residential block. The fourth consumption block, for consumption\nabove 25 m3/month will be priced at the same rate applied to commercial customers. This is\nintended  to  discourage  excessive  consumption  as  well  as  to  reduce  the  incentive  for\nmisclassifying commercial users as being residential for the purposes of tariff application.\nTable A10.5:  Projected Tariff Requirements (D/m3)\nCurrent P r o j e c t e d\nPrices Current Prices Constant Prices\n2000 2002 2004 2006 2008 2002 2004 2006 2008\n Kien Giang WSDC\n A.

Affordability and Willingness to Pay: An affordability has been analyzed to ensure\nthat households, particularly those low-income groups, can afford the proposed water tariffs.\nThe low-income group is defined as the household earning an amount equal to or less than the\naverage  of  the  bottom  20th  percentile  of  income  distribution.  The  tariffs  are  considered\naffordable if they do not exceed approximately 3-5 percent of household income. The results of\nthis analysis are summarized in Table A10.6.\nTable A10.6:  Affordability Analysis\nSubproject Town Percentage of Income to Pay Water Bill\n2002 2008 2010 2014\nChi Thanh\nMedian Income Household 2.2 3.7 3.7 3.4\nLow Income Household 3.1 4.7 4.6 3.9\nLa Hai\nMedian Income Household 2.8 4.8 4.8 4.4\nLow Income Household 4.4 6.6 6.4 5.4\nPhan Rang\nMedian Income Household 2.6 3.0 2.8 2.4\nLow Income Household 2.8 2.8 2.6 2.1\nRach Gia", "69 Appendix 10, page 8\nMedian Income Household 2.2 2.7 2.8 3.0\nLow Income Household 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.9\nTay Ninh\nMedian Income Household 2.3 2.9 3.0 3.1\nLow Income Household 2.6 2.7 2.7 2.5\nThu Dau Mot\nMedian Income Household 1.5 1.6 1.6 1.5\nLow Income Household 1.8 1.6 1.5 1.3\nTuy Hoa\nMedian Income Household 1.6 2.6 2.7 2.4\nLow Income Household 1.7 2.5 2.4 2.1\nSource: ADB estimates.\n13. The willingness of consumers to pay the tariffs has also been assessed. The basis for\nthis assessment is the social survey implemented under the ADB technical assistance that\nestimated median willingness to pay for households presently connected to the piped water\nsystem as well as for those presently not connected. In general, the willingness to pay for those\npresently connected was higher than those not connected. The one exception was in Phan\nRang where, as a result of the high cost and limited availability of nonpiped sources, the\nwillingness to pay for those not presently connected was higher. In Rach Gia, Thu Dau Mot, and\nTuy Hoa the proposed tariffs for 2002 are generally within the existing willingness to pay for\nhouseholds presently having piped water connections. However, by 2008, the tariffs need to be\nset at levels that exceed the existing willingness to pay. For the other towns, tariff requirements\nin 2002 exceed the willingness to pay for households by between about 30 percent (Tay Ninh)\nand 100 percent (Phan Rang, Chi Thanh, La Hai). For those not presently connected, the\nprojected tariff requirements exceed the existing willingness to pay in all towns.\n14. Willingness to Pay: The survey results likely underestimate the willingness to pay. In\nPhan Rang and Tay Ninh, current water bills for a typical household exceed the reported\nwillingness to pay for those connected to the system and yet there appears to be little resistance\nto payment. Willingness to pay is also a function of present levels of service, which are low in all\nof the towns. For those not presently connected to the piped water supply system, it was\nobserved during the implementation of the socioeconomic survey that households often had\ndifficulty  estimating  the  total  cost  of  their  existing  nonpiped  supply  and,  therefore,  their\nwillingness  to  pay  for  piped  water.  As  a  result,  the  gap  between  tariff  requirements  and\nwillingness to pay is likely to be less than that indicated by the survey results. However, there\nremains a need for public education aimed at improving willingness to pay and, therefore,\nwillingness to connect to the piped water system.", "70\nAppendix 11, page 1\nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION\nA.  Introduction\n1. In  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  guidelines,  initial\nenvironmental  examinations  (IEEs)  were  carried  out  as  an  integral  part  of  the  project\npreparatory technical assistance. The IEEs analyzed the likely environmental consequences\nand impacts of the implementation of water supply, drainage, and sanitation improvements in\nthe project towns. The Project aims to improve and sustain the water-related urban facilities in\nprovincial towns Phan Rang, Rach Gia, Tay Ninh, Thu Dau Mot, and Tuy Hoa as well district\ntowns of Chi Thanh and La Hai. One strategic project objective is environmental improvement.\nThe Project is classified as environment category B, as per ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Environmental\nAssessment of Project Impacts. The IEEs are based on an analysis of the impacts of the\nproposed works, the socioeconomic survey conducted during project preparation, and a visual\nassessment of the project towns.\nB.  Description of the Project\n2. The Project will improve the water and sanitation facilities in the seven towns. The\ndetails of the Project are given in the main text of the report.\nC.  Description of the Environment\n1.  Physical Resources\n3. Chi Thanh is a district town on National Highway 1, approximately 30 kilometers (km)\nfrom Tuy Hoa and 1,128 km from Hanoi. The town is on the right bank of the Cai River, which\nalso provides the town\u2019s water. The topography is undulating to hilly. The average annual\nrainfall is 1,670 millimeters (mm), which is concentrated in six months of the year from August to\nJanuary. The area surrounding the town is largely rural.\n4. La Hai is small district town in southeast Viet Nam, about 45 km to the north of Tuy Hoa.\nThe town is on the left side of the Ky Loy River, which is also the source of the town\u2019s water.\nMost of the town lies on the sloping ground above the river, with only a small area on the flood\nplain.  The  terrain  is  hilly.  Groundwater  is  used  extensively  for  water  supply.  The  area\nsurrounding the town is largely rural.\n5. Phan Rang is a coastal town on the left bank of the Cai River, which also provides the\ntown\u2019s water. The town is about 334 km from Ho Chi Minh City. Most of the town lies on\nunconsolidated sediments, and its terrain is relatively flat. The area around the town is largely\nrural, although there is an industrial zone on the opposite bank of the Cai River. Annual rainfall\nis very low at 500\u2013800 mm and mainly distributed from September to November.\n6. Rach Gia is on the Rach Gia Gulf, at the southwest extremity of Viet Nam. It has an\naverage annual rainfall of 1,980 mm, which is concentrated in the May\u2013November period. The\ntown lies on a coastal plain composed primarily of unconsolidated sediments, and its terrain is\nrelatively  flat  and  low-lying  with  many  canals.  The  area  around  the  town  is  largely  rural.\nGroundwater is used extensively for water supply, but has high salinity in the dry season.\nSurface water in the canals also becomes saline during the dry season.", "71\nAppendix 11, page 2\n7. Tay Ninh is in southeast Viet Nam, about 90 km inland from Ho Chi Min City. Its\naverage annual rainfall is 1,805 mm. The town is relatively flat, although there are hills and\nmountains located outside the town. The area around the town is largely rural.\n8. Thu Dau Mot is in southeast Viet Nam, within 40 km of Ho Chi Minh City. The town is\nsituated on the plain between two major rivers, the Saigon and Dong Nai. The average annual\nrainfall is 1,856 mm, most of which occurs from September to November. Groundwater is used\nextensively by households and industry, and is of good quality. However, overexploitation could\nlead to a substantial lowering of the groundwater table and deterioration of groundwater quality.\nThe area surrounding the town is largely rural.\n9. Tuy Hoa is a coastal town in Phu Yen Province in southeast Viet Nam, approximately\n1,158 km from Hanoi. Most of the town area lies on alluvial sandy flats at the mouth of the Da\nRang River, and the terrain is relatively flat. However, within the town is a large hill on which a\nservice reservoir and communications tower have been constructed. The average rainfall is\n2,300 mm, which is concentrated in six months of the year from July to December. The area\nsurrounding the town is largely rural.\n2.  Ecology\n10. There are no known endangered varieties of flora or fauna in the areas proposed for\ndevelopment  in  the  Project.  Land  areas  for  the  proposed  water  supply  and  sanitation\ndevelopment have been developed or disturbed previously and have no forest or unusual\nvegetation cover.\n3.  Human and Economic Development\n11. The population of the provincial project towns varies from 43,000 in Tay Ninh to 198,000\nin Tuy Hoa, while the two district towns, La Hai and Chi Thanh have 8,000-10,000 people. The\nurban areas of the project towns serve principally as service areas for the surrounding rural\nregions.  Their  economies  are  based  on  the  provision  of  services  to  provincial  or  district\npopulations, market trading, light industry, and in the case of Rach Gia, Tuy Hoa, and Phan\nRang, a local fishing industry. Thu Dau Mot and Binh Duong province are undergoing rapid\nindustrial development, and the districts adjacent to the town will be incorporated in the town in\nthe near future. This rapid industrial growth is accompanied by development of high-density\nworker\u2019s accommodation in the form of low level and high-rise housing units. Light industry and\nfood processing are becoming increasingly important to the town economies. The project towns\nhave existing water supplies and combined drainage and sanitation systems, although coverage\nis low. Many suburban areas in the project towns have no piped drainage system, and even in\nthe urban wards, piped drainage coverage is very low. All of the towns are accessible by road,\nall have power supply from the national grid and, all have Government offices.\n4.  Items of Archaeological Significance\n12. There are no known sites of historical or cultural significance in the Project area that are\nlikely to be affected during implementation. However, in the detailed investigation and design of\nwater and sanitation works, particular care will be taken to identify historical and cultural sites,\nand appropriate steps will be taken to protect any such sites.", "72\nAppendix 11, page 3\n5.  Quality of Life\n13. Socioeconomic conditions vary widely between the seven project towns. Thu Dau Mot is\nthe wealthiest town, while Chi Thanh and Phan Rang are the poorest. Average household\noccupancy varies from 4.2 persons in Tay Ninh to 5.1 in Rach Gia. In all of the Project towns,\ncommunity health profiles are less than satisfactory and water supply and sanitation facilities\nare inadequate and pose an environmental health hazard.\nD.  Screening of Potential Environmental Impacts and Mitigation Measures\n1.  Project Sites\n14. Water Sources. Thu Dau Mot and Tuy Hoa have inadequate yields and additional\nsources of supply are required to meet existing and projected demands. The water sources for\nPhan Rang and Tay Ninh are regulated by upstream storage and have adequate yields to\nsupport the water demands of the towns to 2010 and beyond. But the capacities of the raw\nwater systems require augmentation. Rach Gia\u2019s surface water source has adequate yield; the\ncapacity of the raw water system will require augmentation; however, water quality is affected\nby saline intrusion in the dry season. A large raw water reservoir will be constructed to ensure\nthat  adequate  supplies  of  potable  water  are  available  during  the  dry  season.  Increased\ncoverage of piped water supply will reduce town residents\u2019 exploitation of ground water, which\nbecomes saline and unpleasant to drink during the dry season. Chi Thanh\u2019s surface water\nsource suffers from organic pollution by agricultural and animal wastes, and will be replaced by\na  borefield  in  riverside  alluvial  deposits  adjacent  to  the  existing  source.  La  Hai\u2019s  existing\nborefield source has adequate yield and capacity to meet the town\u2019s water demands in 2010.\n15. Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The Project facilities will require about 68 hectares\n(ha) of land, including 52 ha of agricultural and residential land to be acquired from private\nowners. Approximately 71 households will be resettled to allow construction of reservoirs and\nwater  treatment  plants.  There  will  be  more  than  900  affected  persons  entitled  to  receive\ncompensation as a result of the Project. Most of the new major facilities such as treatment plants,\nborefields, and ground level storage will be constructed on Government land. Transmission and\ndistribution mains will generally be constructed along roadways, but it will be necessary to run\nwater supply pipelines through some private properties in most project towns. This will involve\nsome temporary resettlement, as well as compensation and restoration costs. Details of the\nissues are presented in Appendix 7.\n2.  Design Aspects\n16. Pollution  of  groundwater  sources  will  be  minimized  by  ensuring  that  modern  well\nconstruction techniques are used to seal wells against infiltration of shallow groundwater. To\nsafeguard water quality, all treated water reservoirs will be covered and ventilated and the\nsystems  operated  to  ensure  that  the  distribution  network  is  maintained  under  pressure  to\nminimize the risk of contamination from polluted groundwater and backflow. Standby generators\nwill be installed at all treatment plant and pumping station sites to ensue a continuous supply of\nwater at adequate pressure. Backwash water from filters will be passed through a settlement\ntrap to reduce turbidity prior to discharge to the environment. Sludge from water treatment will\nbe discharged into lagoons and dried on sludge drying beds. Sludge and sediment from the\nsettlement trap and from the drying beds will be disposed of at the town landfill sites. The\nProject includes investment in drainage and sanitation to ensure that there is no deterioration in\nexisting conditions. These measures will be accompanied by improved septic tank management", "73\nAppendix 11, page 4\nsystems, regulative initiatives, a public health awareness program, and activities directed at\nimproving drainage and sanitation at the community level. As a precondition to connecting to\npiped supply, householders will be required to install sullage pipes discharging to drains or, in\nlow density areas, to properly constructed soakaways. Noise generated by pumping stations\nand workshops will be minimized by providing thick foundations and bases for equipment, and\nsolid sound-absorbing walls. For the proposed raw water reservoir at Rach Gia, it is proposed\nthat a comprehensive study be carried out to assess the quantity of material affected by acid\nsulfate soils. In addition laboratory trials should be carried out using alternative neutralizing\nagents to determine necessary proportions and mixing methods to optimize the neutralization\nprocess where it is considered necessary.\n3.  Construction Stage\n17. There will be no permanent or significant adverse environmental impacts arising from\nthe construction stage. The community environment during the period of construction of the\nfacilities  and  during  ongoing  operation  will  be  assured  by  appropriate  management  plans,\nequipment  specifications,  and  detailed  design.  During  construction,  the  contractors  will  be\nrequired to prepare and implement environmental management plans (EMPs), and carry out the\nwork  according  to  international  standards,  including  consulting  with  residents  through  paid\ncommunity  coordinators;  providing  safe  and  adequate  temporary  paths  for  residents  and\nbusinesses;  providing  adequate  safety  to  the  public  and  workers;  implementing  effective\nmeasures to reduce erosion, turbidity, dust, and noise due to construction equipment; providing\nlimited transportation and construction along the main roads in urban areas during rush hours\nand in residential areas at night and early morning; appropriately disposing of surplus soil and\nconstruction  materials;  and  minimizing  interruption  to  water  supplies.  During  construction,\nprovincial  project  management  units,  assisted  by  consultants,  will  cooperate  with  affected\nresidents and take all measures needed to minimize the impacts on residents and the public.\n4.  Operation Stage\n18. To ensure safe water is delivered, effective monitoring of the treatment processes,\noperation  and  maintenance  (O&M)  procedures  and  daily  chlorine  residual  testing  in  the\nextremities of the distribution system will be instituted. Periodic microbiological testing of treated\nwater will also be carried out in accordance with the tests and frequencies recommended in the\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) drinking water guidelines. Additional chlorination facilities will\nbe provided at booster pumping stations within the distribution systems in several of the towns,\nin  order  to  maintain  chlorine  residuals  in  the  water.  Where  reliable  microbiological  testing\nfacilities  are  available  from  the  Ministry  of  Health  or  Ministry  of  Science,  Technology  and\nEnvironment (MOSTE), independent sampling and testing of supplied water will be carried out.\nWhere  these  facilities  are  not  currently  available,  the  water  supply  companies\u2019  (WSCs)\nlaboratories  to  be  constructed  or  upgraded  under  the  Project  will  be  equipped  with\nmicrobiological  test  equipment,  and  staff  will  be  trained  in  its  use.  Appropriate  planned\npreventive maintenance programs and budgets will be developed for all facilities constructed\nunder the Project, and for existing facilities. On the job training and structured training courses\nwill  be  given  to  O&M  supervisory  staff,  and  will  include  vocational  training  as  well  as\noccupational health and safety, particularly where this involves the use of potentially hazardous\nchemicals, such as chlorine gas. The Project will also provide O&M equipment necessary to\nenhance  sustainability,  including  leak  detection  equipment,  pipe  cutting  and  threading\nequipment, and vacuum tankers (for septic tank sludge removal and transport).", "74\nAppendix 11, page 5\nE.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Monitoring Program\n19. MOSTE  administers  the  Environmental  Protection  Law  (EPL-1993),  through  its\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Environment. The department is also responsible for\nrecommendations on policy, rules, regulations and guidelines, including environmental quality\nstandards and reviewing and approving environmental impact assessments. MOSTE is also\nresponsible  for  supervising  wastewater  discharges  to  the  environment.  Provincial  people's\ncommittees, assisted by the provincial environmental department (DOSTE) are responsible for\nimplementing the EPL-1993 in the province, including monitoring and enforcement. DOSTE\u2019s\nusual role in each province is to review and approve the EMP, to review monitoring data\nprovided by the WSC, and to periodically inspect the site to validate overall compliance.\n20. The WSCs will be required to commission an EMP for each project component. The\nEMPs will summarize the mitigation measures proposed for the construction and operation of\nthe components. Conformance with the EMP is the normal way to ensure that all mitigation\nmeasures are appropriately addressed. An EMP will also ensure that monitoring and validation\nwill  follow  up  predictions  made  in  the  IEE.  This  may  require  modification  to  design  or\nconstruction aspects that are found to have any impact at variance with that predicted. A\ngroundwater quality surveillance system will be established during the construction of the Rach\nGia  raw  water  reservoir  and  for  its  initial  operating  period  to  monitor  any  changes  in\ngroundwater levels and quality and to quantify any changes that occur. This will assist in\nvalidating the predictions that an improvement in groundwater quality is likely to result from the\nProject. A computerized billing system and management information system will be installed at\neach WSC. This may be used to monitor and manage the septic tanks in the communities, and\nserve as a maintenance management system. During the course of the Project, a database of\nthe sanitation records for the town will be prepared. This will be used to identify septic tanks\nrequiring desludging after the design period of 2-3 years, and will ensure that all septic tanks are\nproperly managed and are cleaned of sludge before they overflow or fail.\nF.  Findings and Recommendations\n21. The Project is designed to improve and sustain the urban environment in the project\ntowns. Within the scope of the project components it will help these urban areas to cope with\nthe development and population pressures that will arise as urbanization increases.\nG.  Conclusion\n22. The Project\u2019s negative impacts will only be temporary, minor, and reversible, and can be\nmitigated  through  proper  policy,  planning,  public  relations,  and  good  construction  and\nsupervision practices. The Project will have no significant adverse environmental impact and an\nenvironmental impact assessment is not necessary.", "75 Appendix 12, page1\nSUMMARY SOCIAL ANALYSIS\nA.  Scope and Information Sources\n1. The social analysis in this Project covers poverty, gender, ethnicity, and community\nparticipation. It is based on several sources. First, a bibliographic search yielded a number of\nreferences, including substantial statistical information such as the 1998 Government Living\nStandards Survey and the 1999 World Bank Participatory Poverty Assessment. The statistical\ndata was instrumental for the poverty analysis, while the gender and participation sections\nbenefited from qualitative analysis, including a nongovernment organization paper on gender\nissues in Viet Nam. Most relevant to the Project is the socioeconomic survey (SES) that was\ncarried out in June and July 2000, covering 2,160 households or about 10,500 people (about 1\npercent of the beneficiaries). The SES was supplemented by project workshops and focus\ngroups (both single sex and mixed sex groups) discussions. The project conducted more than\n25 consultations to design the community development component.\nB.  Socioeconomic Characteristics of the Project Towns\n2. Population. The population of the Project\u2019s proposed service area is about 850,000,\nincluding  urban  and  suburban  areas  of  the  seven  towns  and  adjoining  districts.  The  five\nprovincial towns have populations ranging from about 43,000 to 198,000, while the population of\nthe two district towns is approximately 8,000-10,000. The annual national population growth rate\nis 1.7 percent according to the 1999 census, compared to the recent annual growth rates in the\nproject towns of 1.3-4.2 percent. The projected population of the Project\u2019s proposed service\narea in 2010 is 1.15 million, based on the above growth rates.\n3. Location of Project Towns. These are described in Section C, Appendix 11.\n4. Poverty. To determine a project-defined level of poverty for each town, a conversion\nfactor of the ratio between the World Bank poverty incidence (from surveys) and Ministry of\nLabor, Invalids, and Social Affairs (MOLISA) data, is applied to each town. The result shows\nthat the percentage of the poor is 20.7 percent for Chi Thanh, 7.9 percent for La Hai, 27.0\npercent for Phan Rang, 13.4 percent for Rach Gia, 9.2 percent for Tay Ninh, 7.5 percent for Thu\nDau Mot, and 10.4 percent for Tuy Hoa. The household survey and consultations show that the\nage and size of the household have important impacts on poverty. The other dimension of\npoverty is access to basic services. Table A12.1 shows the access to basic services by income\ngroup.\n5. Employment. The largest single source of income in the project towns was described as\n\u201cown business,\" by 30-35 percent of the households. In La Hai, however, only 13 percent\nderived their income from this source. Other major sources of income in the project towns were\nagriculture and fishing, casual work, Government salaries, and pensions. Many houses had\nmore than one source of income.\n6. Education.  Viet  Nam\u2019s  population  has  a  high  level  of  educational  achievement  as\nindicated by the national literacy rate of 88 percent. The household survey in the project towns\nshow that 98 percent of household heads have at least some primary education, while up to 10\npercent (in Thu Dau Mot) have attained some kind of tertiary education. The lowest level of\ntertiary education was observed in Chi Thanh, with only 2.5 percent. In other towns, the level\nranged from 3 to 9 percent.", "76 Appendix 12, page2\nTable A12.1 - Poverty Profile for Project Towns\nIndicator Town Lowest 20% Highest 20%\nIncome Income\nAccess to Piped Water (%) Rach Gia 27.1 48.3\nTay Ninh 11.9 23.3\nThu Dau Mot 1.7 21.7\nPhan Rang 43.5 70.1\nTuy Hoa 20.0 40.0\nChi Thanh 7.5 52.5\nLa Hai 0 2.3\nToilet Used (%) Rach Gia 85.0 98.3\nTay Ninh 95.0 100.0\nThu Dau Mot 95.0 100.0\nPhan Rang 50.0 89.6\nTuy Hoa 76.6 85.0\nChi Thanh 22.5 87.5\nLa Hai 13.6 38.6\nHead of Household with Education to Rach Gia 21.7 38.0\nSecondary School Level (%) Tay Ninh 23.7 43.3\nThu Dau Mot 20.0 40.0\nPhan Rang 24.2 53.7\nTuy Hoa 23.3 40.0\nChi Thanh 12.5 57.5\nLa Hai 4.5 22.7\nSolid Waste Collection Service (%) Rach Gia 51.6 63.3\nTay Ninh 16.9 33.3\nThu Dau Mot 8.3 70.0\nPhan Rang 51.6 65.7\nTuy Hoa 55.0 61.7\nChi Thanh 5.0 40.0\nLa Hai - -\nOwn Business as Primary Source of Rach Gia 20.0 41.7\nIncome (%) Tay Ninh 27.1 60.0\nThu Dau Mot 20.0 50.0\nPhan Rang 25.8 46.3\nTuy Hoa 25.0 41.7\nChi Thanh 12.5 37.5\nLa Hai 9.1 25.0\nCasual Work as Primary Source of Rach Gia 36.7 11.7\nIncome (%) Tay Ninh 22.0 1.6\nThu Dau Mot 31.7 5.0\nPhan Rang 30.6 14.9\nTuy Hoa 28.3 5.0\nChi Thanh 20.0 2.5\nLa Hai 2.3 2.3\n\u2013 =  no information available.\nSource: Socioeconomic Survey carried out during the feasibility study of the Project.", "77 Appendix 12, page3\n7. Health. Viet Nam ranks below average among the least developed countries in terms of\npublic access to safe water supplies. Lack of safe water and inadequate sanitation are the main\ncauses of the country\u2019s above-average incidence of waterborne and hygiene-related diseases.\nThe household surveys revealed that there are few serious outbreaks of contagious diseases,\nprobably a result of improved public awareness. Waterborne diseases, such as dysentery and\ndiarrhea, and eye diseases were reported in all towns, although records were poor. Other water-\nrelated diseases such as malaria, dengue, and typhoid (in Phan Rang and Tuy Hoa) were also\nreported.\n8. Ethnicity. Each project town has a majority of the Kinh ethnic group, ranging from 91\npercent in Tay Ninh to more than 99 percent in Chi Thanh and La Hai. The main ethnic\nminorities are the Chinese, which are present in all towns and comprise less than 1 percent in\nTuy Hoa to 7 percent in Tay Ninh; Cham, which account for 2 percent in Tay Ninh and 5 percent\nin Phan Rang; and the Khmer minority, which is almost 7 percent of the population in Rach Gia.\nThe Khmer are over-represented in Rach Gia\u2019s poor, having low levels of education, and poor\nliving conditions, and lacking water supply, sanitation, and permanent well-paid jobs. Conditions\nfor the Cham ethnic group vary between Tay Ninh and Phan Rang. In Tay Ninh the Cham are\nclustered into an area in ward 1 where language, customs, and religious practices keep them\nisolated from the outside world. This group has low incomes and poor living conditions (housing,\nwater supply, and sanitation). In Phan Rang the Cham are a larger group dispersed through\nPhan Rang and neighboring Ninh Phuoc. Thanh Hai ward in Phan Rang has the highest\npercentage (54 percent) of households from the Cham ethnic group. These people are poor and\nhave low incomes from subsistence agriculture and handicrafts, and inadequate water and\nsanitation. The settlement is also isolated from the rest of Phan Rang, by physical distance and\naccessibility, as well as language, customs and cultural mores.\n9. Water Supply. In the project towns, the proportion of households with piped water\nsupply ranges from 4 percent (La Hai) to 55 percent (Tay Ninh), and per capita consumption\nvaries between 70 (La Hai) and 137 (Thu Dau Mot) liters per capita per day. Unaccounted-for-\nwater averages 37 percent of water produced. A further 6-10 percent is lost in the water\ntreatment process through backwash and sludge removal. Consumers are required to pay for\nwater supplied to house and tap connections, while water is supplied free of charge at public\ntaps. Water tariffs are based on metered consumption, but many meters are of poor quality and\ndo not measure accurately. As a result, many customers are charged on the basis of estimated\nconsumption. In most towns, customers have paid for and selected their water meter, and\nconsider that it is their property.\n10. Sanitation, Drainage, and Electricity. Sanitation and drainage conditions in all project\ntowns are in a very poor state. Large areas of the provincial and district towns have no piped\ndrainage system. The drainage system coverage in the towns is low. Electricity coverage is high\nthroughout Viet Nam, but the service level varies by region. In all project towns, electricity is\nsupplied  from  the  national  grid,  but  is  unreliable,  and  electricity  cuts  are  commonplace,\nparticularly in Rach Gia, which is at the end of the national grid.\nC.  Needs and Demands of Target Beneficiaries\n11. The needs and demands of low income and poor people are: (i) willing to pay a small\namount to have water located more conveniently; (ii) like better water and toilets but cannot afford\nto connect or build; (iii) would share a connection between 6-10 households; (iv) prefer metered\ntaps  even  if  sharing  between  4-5  households;  (v)  cannot  afford  to  store  water;  (vi)  want", "78 Appendix 12, page4\nimprovement to the quality of piped water; (vii) need knowledge of how to improve sanitation; (viii)\nconsider residential/public toilets are a high priority; (ix) need improved drainage; (x) consider\nsolid waste collection is an important issue; (xi) would be able to contribute labor to build and\nmaintain services, and could manage collection of money for water from a shared connection\nbetween  poor  households;  (xii)  need  a  repayment  facility  such  as  installments  for  water\nconnections; and (xiii) need a credit scheme for toilets.\n12. The needs and demands of women are: (i) greater convenience and less time in collecting\nwater; (ii) need clean water as it is time consuming to filter water or clean storage tank; (iii)\ncomplained that piped water is only available for a few hours a day; (iv) would pay for better\nquality, convenient, and more reliable water; (v) prefer individual meters; (vi) worried about high\nwater connection costs; (vii) needed toilets but cannot afford them; (viii) prefer own toilets; (ix)\nconcerned about cost of removing waste from septic tank toilets; (x) want improved drainage to\nimprove the environment; (xi) consider that solid waste a problem and collection service is\nneeded; (xii) worried about getting sick; health is very important; (xiii) consider that installments\nare needed to pay for water connections; and (xiv) favor credit scheme for toilets (but need to\nknow the terms).\nD.  Social Impacts of the Project\n13. Project Beneficiaries and Benefits. The beneficiaries of the Project include women\nand children, households in general, poor households, small businesses, and schools. The\nbenefits include convenient access to clean, reliable piped water; greater equity in the cost of\nwater; reduction in time and energy spent collecting water from unsafe sources; reduction in\nwaterborne diseases; less time and cost spent filtering, boiling, and storing piped water; and\nenvironmental improvements. In addition, institutions such as water supply companies (WSCs),\nthe Vietnamese Women\u2019s Union, town People\u2019s Committee, and town health office will improve\ntheir ability and knowledge in working with the community on water and sanitation problems.\n14. Improve Access to Clean Water. The poor often walk or cycle long distances (400\u2013\n1,000 meters) daily or more to collect water for drinking if they have no safe and reliable source\nnearby, or when existing wells are dried up, become saline during the dry season, or are\ncontaminated by flood water during the wet season. Access to piped water will mean significant\nincrease the time available for more productive income generating work, education, and health\ncare. Piped water availability will result in increased water purchasing power for the same\nhousehold budget. Greater use of piped water (including for washing dishes, bathing, and\nwashing clothes) will improve health and reduce risk of infection or illness from polluted sources\nsuch as wells.\n15. Credit Schemes. The project provides sanitation credit schemes and water connection\ncredits to poor households to help improve their living conditions and reduce the risk of illness\nand incapacity.\n16. Increased  Employment  Opportunities.  The  Project  could  provide  employment\nopportunities,  including  expansion  of  the  labor  force  of  WSCs  or  public  works  companies\n(PWCs), employment in water resource management, public or community toilet management,\nwater tap management, handcart operation, and community motivation work.\n17. Improved  Hygiene  and  Sanitation  Practices  Health  Impacts.  The  public  health\nawareness program will have a significant impact on the poor. Improved hygiene and sanitation\npractices and awareness of safe sanitation will increase the impact of sanitation conditions and", "79 Appendix 12, page5\nlead to greater effectiveness of this component. Simple technical information on appropriate\ndesign and construction of sanitation facilities will provide valuable guidance to the poor, which\nis currently unavailable. Availability of piped water and proper excreta disposal will lead to\nhealth  improvements  by  reducing  risk  of  waterborne  and  water-related  diseases  including\ndengue fever, diarrhea, eye disease, skin disease, reproductive tract infections, typhoid, and\ncholera. Morbidity due to water-related illnesses has a major impact on the poor. Loss of a\nlaborer has a devastating effect on a poor household and makes it more vulnerable to deeper\npoverty. The effect can be a downward spiral of loss of earnings, unexpected expenditure on\nmedicines and health care, borrowing at high interest rates to pay for health care, increased\nindebtedness, withdrawal of children from school to work, and selling of assets to generate\nincome. When children get sick, an adult is taken out of productive work to look after them.\nChildren regularly suffering from diarrhea are more likely to be malnourished and have stunted\ngrowth and lower retention for learning. Health improvements will reduce the cost of health care\nand medicines to households, with the greatest impact experienced by the poorest section of\nsociety. A visit to a commune health center costs the poor the equivalent of 8 percent of their\nnonfood consumption, which is more than twice the 3 percent spent by the richest households.\nHospital outpatient visits cost the poor around 26 percent of nonfood consumption (four times\nthat of the rich); and in-patient admissions cost 45 percent (twice that of the rich).\nE.  Gender Analysis\n18. Gender in Water Supply and Sanitation. In Viet Nam, women dominate tasks within\nthe household, including preparing food, cooking, washing dishes and cooking utensils, washing\nclothes, bathing babies and children, caring for the elderly, caring for the sick, tending livestock,\nand cleaning house. In the project towns, where piped water is not available, women also have\nan important role in collecting water from other sources. In some communities (e.g., within Phan\nRang) collection of water is a family or household responsibility, as all available labor is needed\nto cope with the task on a daily basis. Where children are involved, girls are twice as likely as\nboys to have responsibility for collecting water in La Hai and Phan Rang, compared to the other\nproject towns where responsibility is evenly divided.\n19. Throughout the project towns women play a lead role in semiformal water and sanitation\nservices, which replicate their traditional roles within or just outside of the home sphere. Women\nare usually employed as street sweepers, rubbish collectors, and public latrine cleaners, rather\nthan men. Community-managed standpipes in a project near Phan Rang were managed by\nwomen. These job opportunities arise because women spend a lot of time at home, but they\nalso tend to keep women at home. Women are employed in the Project provincial WSCs, but\nmostly in a support role carrying out clerical or secretarial functions rather than technical roles,\nwith  the  exception  of  a  few  women  who  are  employed  in  specialist  areas  including  as\nenvironmental scientists, laboratory technicians, and resettlement specialists.\n20. Decision Making. Viet Nam has a high number of female-headed households (almost\none third are female where the head of the household is 45 years or over). Two thirds of female-\nheaded households have no male spouse in the household, with one third having a male\nspouse in the household, but the female is the registered head. Female-headed households\nwere encountered in all of the project towns, and noticeably in poorer towns such as La Hai and\nChi Thanh where male spouses have moved to other areas for employment. Despite this high\nnumber of female-household heads, women are not necessarily the primary decision makers,\nwith influences from either the male spouse or male children affecting decisions. Direct decision\nmaking by women is restricted to household chores, child rearing, and expenses for daily meals,\nwhereas men make more important decisions on major expenditures and the family. This role of", "80 Appendix 12, page6\nmen extends beyond the family to the formal sector, where men make decisions about the use\nand allocation of water and sanitation services at the WSC and government level.\n21. Development Preferences. The SES results show that water supply was a preference\nmore for women than men in La Hai, Rach Gia, and Tay Ninh with the remaining towns evenly\nsplit except Tuy Hoa (41 percent of men compared to 21 percent of women). Women gave\ntoilets a high priority in Phan Rang, Rach Gia, and Tay Ninh with them being more important to\nmen in Chi Thanh and La Hai. Women also generally gave solid waste services, hospitals, and\nschools a higher priority for the project towns than did men.\n22. Project Gender Strategies. The consultations and SES revealed different needs and\nroles of men and women that must be considered in the provision of improved water and\nsanitation  services.  Therefore  the  following  strategies  will  be  incorporated  in  project\nimplementation: (i) meeting the needs of women consumers will be a special focus of the\ncustomer relations department of WSCs; (ii) WSC staff will be trained in effective community\nconsultation and participation; (iii) WSCs and the provincial VMU will closely coordinate in the\nProject implementation; (iv) the VWU will be used for access to women at the grassroots level;\n(v) female community motivators will be used for the public health awareness program (PHAP);\n(vi) opportunities will be provided for women among the unskilled construction work; and (vii)\nparticipatory project evaluation will be done by men and women.\n23. Gender Impacts. The Project will make water conveniently available to women, thus\nreducing  their  efforts,  and  time  spent  on  collecting  water  and  caring  for  other  household\nmembers who are ill from unsafe water or poor hygiene. This will help women improve their own\npersonal health. Drainage and sanitation will result in environmental improvements around the\nhome, more pleasant living conditions, and less risk of illness. Women will also benefit from\nincreased knowledge of safe water practices, personal hygiene, and awareness of the linkage\nbetween water, sanitation, and health. Increased interaction with support agencies such as the\nVWU will reduce the isolation of some women and bring outside influences into the home. The\nfinancial position of poor women will be improved by having more time for productive labor, and\nspending less on water purchased from informal sources.\nF.  Community Participation\n24. Extensive consultation, undertaken during feasibility study, using project workshops,\nfocus groups discussions, and survey methods, will continue during project implementation.\nWSCs will be trained in community consultation techniques, analysis of customer feedback, and\nother  areas  to  improve  participation.  The  PHAP,  community  environmental  sanitation\nimprovement  (CESI)  program,  and  sanitation  credit  scheme  will  all  use  participatory\napproaches. The PHAP, aimed at improving public awareness of water, sanitation, and health,\nhas  been  developed  after  the  model  prepared  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank-financed\ntechnical assistance 2376-VIE: Community Environmental Health Improvements, a successful\nparticipatory program implemented by VWU over three years. The TA final report has provided\nlessons for future improvements. The CESI's main objective is to support community-level\ndemand for sanitation improvements generated through the PHAP, such as toilets, washbasins,\nrubbish bins and collection depots, small-scale drainage, waste dumping areas, and septic\ntanks. The sanitation credit scheme will provide credits to the urban poor for constructing house\nconnections for drainage and septic tanks, and thereby allowing them to fully participate in the\nurban development and benefit from the improved urban services."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20011122165715", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 3.01 for Windows", "Author": "j3m", "Creator": "ADOBEPS4.DRV Version 4.10", "Title": "Microsoft Word - R237-01.doc", "ModDate": "D:20011218190333+08'00'"}}
