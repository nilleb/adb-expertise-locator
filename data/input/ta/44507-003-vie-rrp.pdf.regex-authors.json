The  Board  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  approved  the  Public\u2013Private \nPartnership Support Project on 25 October 2012. The project supports the Government of Viet \nNam  in  developing  bankable  and  commercially  viable  public\u2013private  partnership  (PPP) \ninitiatives, promoting a more conducive environment for PPP, and using PPP as a catalyst for \nbroader  sector  reforms.  Under  the  project,  ADB  will  provide  funding  of  SDR13,171,000 \n(equivalent to $20 million) for the establishment and operation of a project development facility \n(PDF) as a funding mechanism to support PPP project preparation activities, which will include \nthe  preparation  of  prefeasibility  studies,  detailed  feasibility  studies,  and  bid  and  contract \ndocumentation. The loan agreement for the project was signed by ADB and the government on \n17 January 2013 and became effective on 28 May 2013.  \n \n2.  The  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  (MPI)  is  the  executing  agency.  The \nprocurement process for the core team of consultants that will support MPI is currently being \nimplemented.  The  impact  of  the  project  will  be  increased  private  sector  investment  in \ninfrastructure. This will in turn improve the efficiency and quality of infrastructure services and \naccelerate Viet Nam\u2019s economic growth. The outcome will be stronger government capacity to \ncatalyze PPPs and infrastructure investments. The key outputs are an institutional mechanism \nfor developing bankable PPP projects, a more robust PPP enabling framework, and stronger \ninstitutional capacity for PPP.  \n    \nII.  THE ADDITIONAL FINANCING \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) has agreed to provide a cofinancing loan of \n\u20ac8 million (equivalent to $10 million) that will be used to fund the PDF. AFD and the government \nsigned the loan agreement on 9 April 2013. The additional financing from AFD will be used to \nexpand the scale of the PDF, and is consistent with project development objectives, government \npriorities, and ADB\u2019s current country partnership strategy1. A cofinancing agreement between \nADB and AFD now needs to be prepared, setting out the administration arrangements for the \nfacility. \n \nB.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n \n4.  The aggregate impact and outcome of the project will not change as a consequence of \nthe additional financing. The project outputs remain the same, although the additional financing \nfrom AFD will enable the pipeline of PPP projects to be processed by PDF will increase from 10 \nto 15 by 2016. The loan funds from ADB and AFD (the cofinanciers\u2019 loans) will be used to \nfinance the following  activities  based  on  defined  ratios for  each  cost  category:2 (i) engage \ninternational consultants for the PDF technical team who will support the MPI in managing the \nPDF and (ii) engage consultants to undertake project preparation activities for potential PPP \nprojects, including the preparation of prefeasibility studies and detailed feasibility studies, and \nprovision of transaction advisory services. The estimated number of international consultant \ninputs for the PDF technical team will increase from 52 months to 90 months.  The consultant \n                                                \n1 ADB. 2012. Country Partnership Strategy: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132015. Manila \n2 The cost allocation arrangement between ADB and AFD will be done in line with Option 3 of OM J6 (i.e., different \nratios specified for each cost category) and will be as follows: (i) 63.5:36.5 for international consultants on the PDF \ntechnical team and (ii) 67.7:32.3 for project development costs (Appendixes 2 and 3). ", "2 \ninputs for project development will be determined by the PDF technical team following project \nscreening and selection. \n \n5.         ADB will partially administer the AFD funds and be responsible for the recruitment of \nconsultants and the disbursement of the cofinanciers\u2019 loans for the purposes detailed in para. 4. \nThe selection, engagement, and services of these consultants will be in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). For the purposes \nof the project, the disbursements from the AFD loan will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2012, as amended from time to time). \n \nC.  Cofinancing \n \n6.  The proposed AFD cofinancing was initially part of the project concept, but at the time of \nADB loan negotiations the government had not secured internal clearance to borrow from AFD. \nTherefore, AFD cofinancing was not included in the report and recommendation of the President \nfor the project.3 AFD has completed negotiations with the government and signed an agreement \nfor an \u20ac8 million loan on 9 April 2013 under its sovereign loan conditions. The AFD loan will fund \nthe PDF, and it will be administered by ADB under a proposed cofinancing agreement on a joint \nbasis. Interest on the AFD loan has been computed at 2.38% per annum as per standard AFD-\nsubsidized loan conditions (PS2).4 This cost will be directly borne by the government and will \nnot  be  drawn  from  the  loan  proceeds.  AFD  will  provide  retroactive  financing  for  project \ndevelopment  expenses  already  incurred  by  the  Authorised  State  Agencies  or  People\u2019s \nCommittees subject to the latter following the prescribed procedure detailed in the procurement \nplan. The retroactive financing amount will not exceed \u20ac60,000 and will be for eligible expenses \nincurred  within  9  months  before  signing  of  the  loan  agreement  between  AFD  and  the \ngovernment.

ADB has undertaken due diligence of the project for the additional financing to confirm \nthe details of the AFD loan agreement. The MPI prepared feasibility studies for both the ADB \nand AFD loans. ADB completed a mission to Viet Nam from 10\u201312 December 2012, and held \ndiscussions with the MPI and AFD on the status of feasibility studies and loan negotiations. ADB \nhas received a copy of the signed loan agreement between the government and AFD.   \n \n8.  There is no change to the implementation arrangements for the project. The MPI will be \nthe executing agency in collaboration with the PPP task force and other government ministries \nand agencies involved in PPP. The task force, chaired by the MPI and comprising the Ministry \nof Finance, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of \nConstruction, State Bank of Viet Nam, and other relevant agencies, was established in mid-\nJanuary 2011 to provide overall guidance to the government\u2019s PPP piloting initiative. The task \nforce is being restructured to allow more senior representation of the ministries, which will \nenable it to function more effectively as an inter-ministerial coordination body for PPP. The task \nforce will have high-level oversight of the PDF and will be the mechanism for coordination of line \nministries on the use of the PDF. A dedicated project management unit will be established with \nstaff assigned from the PPP office of the MPI for day-to-day management of the PDF under the \nproject. The unit will be supported by a team of national and international experts on PPP who \nwill be funded by the project.
