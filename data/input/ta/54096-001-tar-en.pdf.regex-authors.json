INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support regional technical assistance (TA) will support the Asian Bond \nMarkets Initiative (ABMI) of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Japan, the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) through support to the \nASEAN+3  Bond  Market  Forum  (ABMF)  to  foster  standardization  of  market  practices  and \nharmonization of regulations relating to cross-border bond transactions of ASEAN+3.1  \n \n2.  The  TA  is  included  in  the  work  program  of  the  Economic  Research  and  Regional \nCooperation Department of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for 2020 and is aligned with \noperational  priority  7  of  Strategy  2030:  fostering  regional  cooperation  and  integration.  In  \nparticular, Strategy 2030 states that ADB will (i) strengthen financial sector cooperation by \ndeveloping regional bond markets, (ii) facilitate common frameworks in financial regulations and \nsupervision, (iii) promote measures to harmonize cross-border financial transactions, and (iv) \npursue greater collaboration with the ABMI to help develop bond markets and to expand private \nsector operations.2 In addition, bond market developments will support improvement of the debt \nmanagement framework, which supports public management reforms and financial stability under \noperational priority 6 of Strategy 2030: strengthening governance and institutional capacity. The \nTA is also based on the ASEAN+3 ABMI Medium-Term Road Map, 2019\u20132022 (\u201cABMI Medium-\nTerm Road Map\u201d), endorsed at the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers\u2019 and Central Bank Governors\u2019 \nMeeting in Nadi, Fiji, in May 2019.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Since the establishment of the ABMI, ASEAN+3 local currency domestic bond markets \nhave developed significantly to mitigate mismatches of currency and maturity, i.e., the \u201cdouble \nmismatch\u201d problem. The aggregate amount of local currency bonds outstanding in ASEAN \nmember economies, the PRC, and the Republic of Korea reached $15.7 trillion at the end of 2019, \nwhich surpassed yen domestic bonds and is approaching the amount of euro-denominated bonds \nissued by residents of the euro area.  \n \n4.  However, the ASEAN+3 region still faces vulnerability. When the region was hit by the \ncoronavirus pandemic, a shortage of United States dollar liquidity surfaced because reliance on \nUnited States dollars in intraregional cross-border transactions remains high. The ABMI Medium-\nTerm Road Map identified the following as the remaining challenges: (i) different levels of bond \nmarket development within the ASEAN+3 region, (ii) a large infrastructure investment gap, (iii) \nthe need for sustainable finance, (iv) low intraregional portfolio investments, and (v) inefficient \nresource mobilization for regional cooperation and integration.4 Though local currency bond \nmarkets in the region have grown rapidly, they are still fragmented. Divergence and fragmentation \nof  local  currency  bond  markets  in  ASEAN+3 is  caused  by  gaps  in market  developments; \ndivergences in legal frameworks and market practices; and insufficient coordination of regional \ninitiatives. These need to be overcome by developing further understanding and standardization \nof legal frameworks and market practices to ensure interoperability, and providing learning \nopportunities through a more coordinated approach among different regional initiatives. \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 11 June 2020. \n2  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n3  ASEAN+3. 2019. Asian Bond Markets Initiative Medium-Term Road Map, 2019\u20132022. Jakarta. \n4  Under the road map, the following TA was proposed and approved to help address the challenge of the need for \nsustainable finance: ADB. 2020. Technical Assistance for Creating Ecosystems for Green Local Currency Bonds for \nInfrastructure Development in ASEAN+3. Manila. \n ", " \n2 \n \n5.  The previous TA launched six pilot bonds under the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency Bond \nIssuance  Framework (AMBIF)  to  integrate  the participating markets  in  the  region.5 AMBIF \nfacilitates cross-border bond issuance and investments by creating common market practices, \nutilizing a common document template for submission (called the Single Submission Form) and \npublishing transparent issuance procedures such as the AMBIF Implementation Guidelines for \neach participating market. In addition, bond market guides for 14 ASEAN+3 markets were \ncompleted to deepen understanding of different legal and regulatory frameworks. To ensure inter-\noperability, standards under the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) such as ISO \n20022, a new financial messaging standard for banking network, will be implemented by 2025. \nThanks to the efforts by the TA as well as various supporting factors, intraregional bond issuance \nhas grown from $8.4 billion in 2016 to $14.4 billion in 2019. However, to ensure the continued \ngrowth, the previous TA also highlighted the need for further comparative market analyses to \nexpand AMBIF participating markets and further standardization of operational procedures. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n6.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Regional financial integration in ASEAN+3 \nincreased, and public management reforms and financial stability enhanced.6 The TA will have \nthe following outcome: ASEAN+3 local currency bond markets more integrated.7  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n7.  The ABMF, comprising bond market experts from the public and private sectors in \nASEAN+3, needs to continuously function as a regional platform to collect views, opinions, and \nexpertise to support regional actions.8 The root causes of the identified challenges are (i) limited \ninformation and learning opportunities to narrow capacity gaps; (ii) insufficient understanding of \ndifferent legal frameworks in member economies; (iii) reliance on proprietary systems and limited \nstandardization; and (iv) limited joint actions with Technical Assistance Coordination Team \n(TACT) and the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO). Since its inception in 2010, \nthe ABMF has been tackling these problems gradually. Bond market guides for all ASEAN+3 \nmarkets have narrowed the information gap and promoted further market developments by \nmaking comparisons with neighboring markets. In addition, AMBIF was developed based on \nfindings  made  while  drafting  the  bond  market  guides.  Awareness  of  international  financial \nstandards has been enhanced, which makes cross-border transactions more efficient. The TA will \nenhance ABMF activities by achieving the following five outputs (para. 9\u201313). \n \n8.  Output  1:  Bond  market  guides  for  ASEAN+3  markets  updated  and  published. \nThrough the process of updating bond market guides, this output will address the following \nchallenge identified in the ABMI Medium-Term Road Map: different levels of bond market \n \n5  ADB. 2017. Support for ASEAN+3 Bond Market Forum under the New Asian Bond Markets Initiative Medium-Term \nRoad Map \n6   ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n7   The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n8  The ABMF members are from central banks, securities market regulators, ministries of finance, stock exchanges, \ncentral securities depositories, market associations, major financial institutions, and information technology vendors \nin ASEAN+3. The ABMF is organized three times a year, and each ABMF meeting can attract more than 100 \nparticipants from the region. \n ", " \n3 \ndevelopment  within  the  ASEAN+3  region  (para.  5).  To  expedite  the  process  of  market \ndevelopments, the less-developed markets need to learn from neighboring markets. The bond \nmarket guides have played a key role to identify market impediments and areas for further \ndevelopments. Through the process of updating guides, ADB will closely engage with regulators \nand market players, allowing for knowledge sharing and capacity development.9 Bond market \nguides for regulatory information, payment and settlement systems, and market infrastructures \nwill be published to explain recent advancements in the region. \n \n9.  Output 2: Markets participating in and bonds based on the ASEAN+3 Multi-Currency \nBond Issuance Framework increased. By promoting AMBIF further, this output will address the \nfollowing challenges identified in the ABMI Medium-Term Road Map: a large infrastructure \ninvestment gap, low intraregional portfolio investments, and efficient resource mobilization for \nregional cooperation and integration. To support recycling of vast savings within the region to lead \ninfrastructure finance, the ABMF will thoroughly investigate the causes of limited entry in each \neconomy, and develop initiatives that are consistent with other policy objectives and existing legal \nframeworks.  AMBIF  was  established  based  on  such  recognition,  and  can  thus  support \nintraregional investments without creating conflict. To support AMBIF, a new working group to \nconduct comparative analyses of capital market-related laws will be established under the ABMF. \nThe ABMF will support market authorities who wish to be a part of AMBIF by providing advice \nand supporting regulatory changes, if necessary. In addition, the ABMF will closely collaborate \nwith the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility to promote project bonds in the region because \ninfrastructure projects often face legal challenges arising from different, or the lack of, legal and \nregulatory frameworks.  \n \n10.  Output 3: Standards and regional frameworks in cross-border financial transaction \nreporting  developed.  By  promoting  standardization,  this  output  will  address  the  following \nchallenge identified in the ABMI Medium-Term Road Map: low intraregional portfolio investments. \nSince its establishment, the ABMF has promoted implementation of international standards, \nparticularly ISO 20022 and ISO 17442 (legal entity identifier). Standardization will facilitate \nintraregional portfolio investments by reducing regulatory and tax reporting burdens. In ASEAN+3, \ncross-border transactions must be reported to each market\u2019s authorities, and often require \napprovals  from  them,  which  increase  cross-border  transaction  costs.  The  TA  will  support \nmeasures to facilitate this reporting with fewer costs, and increase market transparency through \nstandardization. Standardization will also support further data exchanges via financial networks \nas well as mobilization of regional resources. \n \n11.  Output  4:  Further  collaboration  with  Asian  Bond  Markets  Initiative  Technical \nAssistance Coordination Team and ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office increased. \nBy increasing collaborative activities between the TACT, AMRO, and ABMF, this output will \naddress the following challenge identified in the ABMI Medium-Term Road Map: efficient resource \nmobilization for regional cooperation and integration. The ABMF will conduct joint missions to \nwork with the ASEAN Secretariat, which is the manager of the ABMI TACT, to support Cambodia, \nthe Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam as well as the other ASEAN \nmember states.  The  ABMF  secretariat  team will  also  invite  the  AMRO,  which  has  gained \ninternational recognition and experience and knowledge in macroeconomic management, for \ncapacity development activities to narrow the development gap. In addition, the ABMF will support \n \n9  Based on discussions through bond market guides, Indonesia introduced a \u201cprofessional investor\u201d definition, the \nPhilippines revised a stock exchange rule to accommodate profile listing, and Cambodia enacted a new prakas (A \nregulation issued by a minister or by the governor of the National Bank of Cambodia concerning banking or financial \nissues) for debt securities offering for qualified investors.   \n ", " \n4 \nother ABMI TA projects to help address the ABMI challenges identified in the ABMI Medium-Term \nRoad Map.10  The TA will support development of green, social, and sustainability bond markets; \nbond market information collection and dissemination through the AsianBondsOnline web portal; \nand implementation of a regional settlement intermediary under the ABMI. The collaboration with \nother TA projects will increase efficiency and effectiveness of the ASEAN+3 regional initiatives.  \n \n12.  Output 5: Asian Bond Markets Initiative medium-term road map for 2023\u20132026 \ndeveloped. At the request of the co-chairs of the ABMI, a new medium-term road map will be \ndeveloped by assessing the implementation of the ABMI Medium-Term Road Map and, in \nconsultation with ASEAN+3, identifying priorities for ASEAN+3 to consider supporting over the \nmedium term from 2023 to 2026. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.
