In  May  2002,  the  Country  Programming  Mission  reached  agreement  with  the \nGovernment on providing advisory technical assistance (TA) for capacity building for structural \nreforms  in  Sikkim,  based  on  consultations  with  the  Government  and  concerned  state \ngovernment officials. This has been reconfirmed in the  India Country Strategy and Program \n(CSP)  2003\u20132006  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  approved  by  ADB\u2019s  Board  of \nDirectors on 30 April 2003.1 The goals, outputs, activities, implementing arrangements, and \nfinancing arrangements are detailed in this paper. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Sikkim, a small state with a population of 540,493, is nested in the Himalayas  and \nborders Bhutan, Nepal, and the People\u2019s Republic of China. Although Sikkim\u2019s record in terms \nof human development indicators  is  impressive,  the  state  faces  problems  of  poverty  and \nunemployment. Sikkim has a history of high and persistent poverty. It has the fifth highest \nincidence of poverty among the states of India, with 36.6% of the population below the poverty \nline in 1999/2000.  \n \n3.  Sikkim\u2019s economic growth rate is  quite high.  Gross state domestic product (GSDP) \nregistered an average annual growth rate of 8.4% during 1993/94 to 1999/2000, much higher \nthan the national average. However, there is serious concern about the sustainability of such \nhigh growth in the future. This growth has primarily been led by government expenditure in \npublic administration, construction, and other services. The public sector accounts for almost \nhalf  of  net  state  domestic  product.  Sikkim\u2019s  fiscal  situation  indicates  that  such  public \nexpenditure-led growth is unsustainable. \n \nTable 1: Key Indicators of Sikkim \n \nItem  Sikkim  Indiaa \nSocioeconomic Indicators     \n  Population, 2001  540,493b 1,027,015,247c\n  Literacy Rate (%), 2001  69.7b 65.4c\n  Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births), 1998  43.9b 67.6c\n  Per Capita Income (Rs, Current Price), 2000/01  15,550c 16,707c\nFiscal Indicators (Percentage of GSDP for Sikkim and GDP for all states)     \n  Own Tax Revenue, 2000/01  7.2d 5.6e\n  Revenue Surplus/Deficit (-), 2000/01  10.9d -2.6e\n  Fiscal Surplus/Deficit (-), 2000/01  -5.5d -4.3e\nGDP = gross domestic product, GSDP = gross state domestic product. \na Fiscal indicators of India refer to all states. \nSources: b Government of Sikkim. 2001.

ADB decided to undertake these on a stand-alone basis \nthrough staff consultants and to focus the scope of the TA on topics relevant for fiscal consolidation. Consequently, \nthe title of the TA was changed in  CSP to Capacity Building for Fiscal Reforms in Sikkim. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 21 July 2003. ", "2 \n4.  The fiscal deficit to GSDP ratio hit an alarming figure of 19.5% during 1998/99. This may \nbe ascribed to the implementation of the Pay Commission recommendation resulting in a sharp \nrise in the salaries of government employees. Nevertheless, there has been a substantial rise in \nrevenue expenditure during the late 1990s, with a significant jump in 1998/99 because of the \nPay Commission recommendations.  The revenue expenditure to GSDP ratio rose from 51.1% \nin 1994/95 to 83.76% in 2000/01. A cause for concern is the steady rise in interest payment (as \na share of GSDP) from 6.1% in 1994/95 to 9.2% in 2001/02. The rise in the interest burden is \nattributable to a shift in the composition of debt toward the more expensive internal borrowing. \nOver the same period, the capital outlay to GSDP ratio shows a fluctuating trend. It declined to \n13.1% in 1998/99 from 15.5% in 1994/95 to accommodate Pay Commission shock. However, \nthe capital outlay to GSDP ratio went up to 16.6% in 2000/01. The government of Sikkim took \nseveral steps to contain the fiscal deficit. These included rationalization and revision of land tax, \nrevision  of  taxes  on  forest  products,  and  expenditure  containment  through  rightsizing of \ngovernment  departments.  The  fiscal  deficit  to  GSDP  ratio  was  brought  down  to  5.5%  in \n2000/01. However, it is still higher than the average of all states. \n \n5.  One major drawback of Sikkim\u2019s state finances is that collection of tax and nontax \nrevenue as a percentage of GSDP is declining. Except for state sales tax and motor vehicle tax, \nbuoyancies are well below one.  \n \n6.  The state\u2019s outstanding debt as a percentage of GSDP is rising. Sikkim\u2019s indebtedness \nto the centre and financial institutions has reached very high levels, with larger plan size leading \nto higher borrowing.3 This has led to a situation where debt servicing (amortization) and interest \npayments  together  are  higher  than  total  borrowing,  thereby  implying  a  reverse  outflow of \nresources on the borrowing/debt-servicing account. Outstanding debt, which was estimated to \nbe Rs1 billion at end-March 1990, has grown nearly eight times to Rs8.3 billion by end-March \n2003. Moreover, outstanding contingent liabilities have also increased significantly from Rs0.13 \nbillion at end-March 1997 to more than Rs1 billion at end-March 2001. \n \n7.  The state has 11 public sector enterprises. These enterprises primarily operate in four \nareas: instrumentation, food processing, mining, and banking. All the enterprises together are \nincurring  a  net  annual  loss  of  Rs40  million.  Latest  available  figures  indicate  that  total \naccumulated losses are Rs0.3 billion, which represented almost 50% of the state\u2019s fiscal deficit \nin FY2000.  \n \n8.  It is clear that \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d\u2014public expenditure-led growth\u2014is unsustainable. On \nthe one hand, it will lead to a distinct decline in the growth of output and employment. On the \nother, demand for employment will continue to grow rapidly. Also, an important feature of \nSikkim\u2019s demographic profile is that 60% of the total population is below 24 years. This implies a \nburgeoning expansion of the workforce and demand for jobs. Thus, the strategy of public \nexpenditure-led growth will result in a significant increase in open or disguised unemployment \nwith related social consequences. \n \n9.  As indicated in the Vision Document and the Plan Overview of Sikkim\u2019s Tenth Five-Year \nPlan,4  in  order  to  generate  adequate  employment,  Sikkim  now  needs  to  launch  a  new \n                                                 \n3  This is despite the fact that Sikkim is a \u201cspecial category\u201d state and, therefore, receives substantial financial and \nnonfinancial support from the central Government. It currently receives 90% of its plan assistance as grants, and \nthe remaining 10% as loans. This rule is different for \u201cgeneral category\u201d states, which receive 30% of their plan \nassistance as grants, and the remaining 70% as loans. \n4 Government of Sikkim. 2001.

Gangtok. \n ", "      3 \ndevelopment strategy that fosters private sector investment in key sectors where the state has \ncomparative advantage, such as tourism and high-valued agricultural products. This would \nrequire provision of better social and economic infrastructure. The state needs to consolidate its \nfiscal position to provide  high-quality  infrastructure  and other public utilities in a sustained \nmanner. Fiscal reforms are needed to ensure that there is some fiscal space for augmenting \nexpenditure  on  infrastructure,  both  physical  and  social.  Thus,  without  serious  fiscal \nconsolidation, the government of Sikkim will not be able to provide adequate and high-quality \nphysical infrastructure or other key public services, thereby seriously weakening growth and the \nemployment potential of the state.5 \n \n10.  India\u2019s CSP approved in 2003 aims at mainstreaming poverty reduction. Pro-poor growth \nsupported by good governance and social development is the main strategic theme for reducing \npoverty\u2014both income poverty and human poverty. ADB\u2019s new CSP for India argues that one of \nthe key elements in promoting good governance is state-level fiscal policy reforms combined with \ninterventions to strengthen local governments to ensure greater accountability, transparency, and \nefficiency in pro-poor service delivery. Moreover, ADB\u2019s new strategy provides for extension of \nstate-level  operations  to  some  of  the  poorer  states,  especially  in  the  northeast,  where \ngovernments are committed to reform. This will help strengthen the poverty-reducing impact of the \nnew  strategy.  Thus,  it  was  decided  in  the  new  strategy  to  extend  assistance  for  fiscal \nconsolidation  to  two  new  states  in  the  northeast\u2014Assam  and  Sikkim.6  Fiscal  consolidation \nmeasures may be categorized broadly into two groups: direct reform measures with immediate \nimpact  on  revenue  or  expenditure,  and  capacity-enhancing  measures  that  are  essential  to \nimplement these reforms as well as to sustain reform initiatives in the long run. Thus,  ADB\u2019s \nassistance  typically  supports  (i) new  tax  and  nontax  measures  to  enhance  state  revenues, \n(ii) debt restructuring to reduce the burden of debt servicing, (iii) rationalization of wasteful public \nexpenditure, and (iv) enhanced allocation of resources for social services. Closely related to such \ninitiatives is the restructuring of state enterprises to reduce the fiscal burden of the losses of these \nenterprises.  Similarly,  ADB\u2019s  support  for  capacity-building  measures  typically  includes \n(i) restructuring  of  government  departments  including  the  commercial  tax  department, \n(ii) facilitating  information  technology-enabled  services,  (iii) streamlining  the  budget-making \nprocess,  and  (iv) rationalizing  local  government  finances  including  reform  of  the  accounting \nsystem of local bodies.7 \n \n                                                 \n5  Assistance for fiscal consolidation is also very important from the overall macroeconomic perspective. The recent \nslowdown in India\u2019s GDP growth cannot be attributed to transient factors alone. Systemic factors have also been at \nwork, including some structural constraints in India\u2019s growth dynamics, driven primarily by fiscal imbalances. In the \npast economic growth in India was led by public investment. However, the situation has changed significantly, \nespecially since the late 1990s. The growing burden of servicing burgeoning public debt, the large volume of \nsubsidies, and a sharp increase in the bill of government salaries in the states as well as in the central Government \nhave crowded out public investment, especially in infrastructure. Unfortunately, private investment has failed to \nreplace public investment as an engine of growth since it was also constrained by high interest rates\u2014the effects \nof a continuing fiscal imbalance and government borrowings. Reduced rates of public and private investment in \nturn constrain the development of infrastructure, thereby reducing the growth potential of the economy. Therefore, \nthe success of the ongoing structural adjustment programs crucially depends on fiscal consolidation. \n6 Assistance to Sikkim also fits well with ADB\u2019s program of promoting economic cooperation in South Asian \nSubregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC), consisting of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal, since Sikkim \nshares common borders with these countries (except Bangladesh).  \n7  ADB. 2003.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  The TA aims to help  the government of Sikkim design effective measures needed to \nimprove  the  state\u2019s  public  finances,  and  build  the  necessary  capacity  within  the  state \ngovernment for implementing and sustaining these measures. This objective will be achieved by \nadopting a comprehensive five-pronged approach. First, the TA will help the state government \nformulate tax and nontax reform measures to enhance its revenue-raising capacity. Second, the \nTA will facilitate restructuring of various  state government departments for efficient service \ndelivery and upgrading of the institutional capacity of the state\u2019s Finance Department to manage \nand control public spending, while instilling greater accountability and transparency in budget \nmaking. Third, the TA will prepare a detailed restructuring plan for state-owned enterprises \n(SOEs).  Fourth,  the  TA  will  strengthen  the  capacity  of  local  bodies  to  assume  greater \nresponsibility  for  social  spending,  and  increased  transparency  and  accountability  in  their \nfunctions.  Finally,  the  TA  will  enhance  the  capacity  of  the  Directorate  of  Economics  and \nStatistics to create a reliable socioeconomic database for the state. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will help develop a detailed plan to introduce value-added tax (VAT) in Sikkim \nincluding a plan for restructuring the Commercial Tax Department for the efficient introduction of \nvalue-added tax (VAT), in the state; study the tax structure and revenue buoyancy of stamp duty \nand registration fees, motor vehicle taxes, state excise duty, and other minor taxes, and \nrecommend  ways  of  mobilizing  additional  resources  in  a  sustained  manner;  and  propose \nmeasures to mobilize additional revenue from nontax sources, including levy of adequate user \ncharges on all publicly provided services. The TA will also review intersector and intrasector \nbudget allocations under a public expenditure review to rationalize public expenditure to better \nsupport the poverty reduction and human development priorities; introduce multiyear budgeting; \nand promote greater output-linked accountability in budget formulation and implementation for \nthe state government and local bodies and train concerned officials. In respect of SOE reform, \nthe TA will prepare a feasible action plan to restructure SOEs after carefully reviewing all the \noptions  (privatization/revival/closure)  as  well  as  the  government  of  Sikkim\u2019s  resource \nconstraints. The TA will also design a feasible debt-restructuring plan. Finally, the TA will \nstrengthen the capacity of the Directorate of Economics and Statistics to estimate saving and \ncapital formation in Sikkim, and impart training to conduct consumption expenditure surveys to \nestimate a reliable poverty profile for Sikkim.  \n \n13.  The TA will further help develop a realistic baseline projection of the state\u2019s finances and \ncarry  out  alternative  policy  simulations  under  various  tax  and  expenditure-related reform \nscenarios that are being designed under the TA.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $769,000 equivalent comprising $377,250 in \nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $391,750  equivalent  in  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  finance \n$600,000 equivalent, which includes the entire foreign exchange cost and $222,750 equivalent \nof local currency cost, to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United \nKingdom. The remaining $169,000 equivalent will be contributed by the government of Sikkim, \nwhich will include counterpart staff remuneration, office accommodation and supplies, transport, \n ", "      5 \nand other logistical support.  The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are shown in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  Sikkim\u2019s Finance Department will be the Executing Agency for the TA. Implementation of \nthe  TA  will  be  supervised  by  the  Public  Finance  Reforms  Committee  (PFRC),  which  will \nexamine the TA\u2019s findings and suggestions and make recommendations to the government of \nSikkim for their implementation. This arrangement will lend considerable credibility to the TA\u2019s \nfindings and help integrate ongoing reform initiatives with the TA. The government of Sikkim will \nform the Committee before the TA consultants are engaged. The Principal Secretary, Finance \nwill chair the Committee. The government of Sikkim will also nominate key senior officials from \nthe concerned departments in PFRC. The Executing Agency will provide office space, furniture, \nequipment, and counterpart staff for the TA consultants, who will receive advice and guidance \non an operational basis from the chairperson of PFRC. \n \n16.  A consulting firm will be recruited  to provide a team of international and domestic \nconsultants to execute the TA. The firm will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The quality and cost-based selection method will be used \nto select the firm. The simplified technical proposal procedure will be applied to the selection of \nthe  consulting  firm.  About  30  person-months  of  consultancy  services  (13  person-months \ninternational, 17 person-months domestic) will be required. The international consultants will \ninclude a team leader and public finance specialist, budget and public expenditure management \nspecialist, and a VAT expert. The domestic consultants will include an assistant team leader \nwith expertise in state finances and utilities pricing, a public enterprise restructuring specialist, a \nstate income estimation expert, and a survey expert with sound knowledge about sampling \nmethodology for consumption expenditure surveying. The state government will provide budget \nand accounting experts and a computer hardware expert. The outline terms of reference for the \nconsultants are provided in Appendix 3. The TA will include purchase of equipment (computer \nhardware) as needed. All procurement of equipment will be undertaken in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. The TA will be implemented over 6 months and is expected \nto commence in February 2004. Physical completion of the TA is expected by July 2004. The \nconsultants will prepare an inception report within 4 weeks of the start of their services and an \ninterim report after completing half of their consulting services. The draft final report will be \nsubmitted 2 weeks before the end of consulting services and discussed at a tripartite meeting. \nThe final report, to be provided as a hard copy and a soft copy, will incorporate the comments of \nthe government of Sikkim and ADB, and will be submitted to ADB within a month of the tripartite \nmeeting. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 to the Government \nof India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for Capacity \nBuilding for Fiscal Reforms in Sikkim, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1
