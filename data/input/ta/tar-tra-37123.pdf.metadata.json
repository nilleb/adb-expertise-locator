The Doha Ministerial Declaration highlighted the importance of capacity building  in \nintegrating developing countries into the multilateral trading system. International trade plays a \nkey role in reducing poverty through faster economic growth, development, and creation of \nemployment. In view of the global economic slowdown, the World Trade Organization (WTO) \nlaunched a new WTO round (Doha Development Agenda) to revitalize the world economy by  \nexpanding trade. International institutions have an important role in helping developing countries \nmeet the capacity-building challenges of the Doha Development Agenda.  Two developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)\u2014Cambodia and Nepal, both \nleast developed countries\u2014became  WTO members in September 2003 at the Fifth WTO \nMinisterial  Conference  in  Cancun,  Mexico.  However,  no  agreement  was  reached  on  the \nframework and modalities of negotiations. \n2.  ADB in its reorganization in January 2002 created a governance, finance, and trade \ndivision in each regional department to strengthen its services in trade matters. In addition, ADB \nand WTO concluded a memorandum of understanding in May 2002 to cooperate on joint  \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  programs  in  WTO-related  issues  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific.  ADB \nlaunched Capacity Building for DMCs on the WTO Trading System in June 2002, a capacity-\nbuilding  program  comprising  a  high-level  meeting  on  the  WTO  trading  system  and  three \nintensive courses on trade facilitation, the WTO Customs Valuation Agreement, and the WTO \nAgreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS).  \n3.  The proposed capacity-building program is directly linked to ADB\u2019s overarching objective \nof  poverty  reduction.  It  will  strengthen  the  framework  for  liberalization  and  facilitation  of \ninternational trade under the WTO trading regime to hasten  economic growth as income level \nincreases. It will also enhance DMCs\u2019 capacity to formulate national external trade policies.  The \nTA directly supports the program.1  Appendix 1 gives the TA framework. \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Since the launch of a new WTO round in November 2001, negotiations on trade in \ngoods and services have accelerated. Among ADB\u2019s DMCs are 22 WTO members and 10 WTO \napplicants, all of which are participating in the new round.  While there are many important items \non the trade agenda, many DMCs are concerned with two areas: the so-called Singapore issues \nand WTO rules and regulations. \n5.  The Singapore issues are new areas on which the Fifth  WTO Ministerial Conference in \nCancun,  Mexico,  in  September  2003  reached  no  agreement  on  whether  to  include  in  the \nnegotiating  agenda.  The  Singapore  issues  are  (i)  trade  and  investment,  (ii)  trade  and \ncompetition policy, (iii) trade facilitation, and (iv) transparency in government procurement.2 In \naddition, the issue of environment and trade is a new area for negotiation. WTO has been \nundertaking relevant studies on the first three items since the first WTO Ministerial Conference \nin Singapore in 1996.  As an effort to include the Singapore issues in the negotiating agenda is \nbeing made and new international rules on them will have an impact on the  trade patterns in \nDMCs, capacity-building activities are necessary for the new areas.  \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in  March 2003. \n2  In a strict sense, government procurement is not a new area for negotiation, as a WTO agreement on this area\u2014 \nthe Agreement on Government Procurement\u2014already exists. ", "2 \n6.  The second area is WTO rules and regulations, in particular, antidumping duty and rules \nof origin. Antidumping duty is widely used as a trade remedy measure under WTO by developed \nmembers of WTO, such as Australia, Canada,  European Union, and United States, and also by \nseveral developing members. Antidumping action is taken on exports from the ADB region. The \nantidumping rules need clarification and elaboration.  No precise international agreement on \nrules of origin is applicable to specific product categories or products, although the Uruguay \nRound concluded a framework agreement that provides discipline, and requests the World \nCustoms Organization (WCO) to develop detailed rules. Rules of origin are mainly used  for \ntrade statistics, application of the most-favored nation  rate of duty, and antidumping and \ncountervailing duty actions. Any free trade agreement  and generalized system of preferences \n(GSP) contains preferential rules of origin. Since rules of origin are currently based on national \nlaws, some disputes occur. The application of particular rules to each  product is complicated. \nCapacity-building activities focusing on these rules will greatly help trade officials in DMCs.   \n7.  The Economics and Research Department (ERD) is studying regional integration and \ntrade, including the Singapore issues. The TA will provide an opportunity to present outcomes \nfrom the study, particularly, on investment. Annex I of the Memorandum of Understanding with \nWTO enumerates \u201cpotential areas for cooperation,\u201d and the areas covered by the TA are all \ncontained  in  the  Annex.  WTO  is  expected  to  provide  experts  as  resource  persons  in  the \ncapacity-building program. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The main objective of the TA is to encourage DMCs\u2019 full integration into the WTO \nmultilateral trading system through (i) increased awareness of new areas to be covered by the \nDoha Development Agenda for policy formulation, and (ii) assistance in providing technical \ninputs and sharing the results of studies with DMCs so that they can fully participate in the new \nWTO round. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The capacity-building program has four components: (i) a high-level meeting for DMC \nnegotiators on key Doha Development Agenda issues, (ii) an intensive course on investment, \n(iii) an intensive course on antidumping, and (iv) an intensive course on rules of origin. In \nimplementing  the  four  activities,  ERD  will  consult  with  Asia-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation \n(APEC), United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), WCO, WTO, and \nother relevant organizations. Target participants will be actual DMC negotiators (e.g., officials in \ncharge of the Doha Development Agenda) for the high-level meeting, and senior government \nofficials (e.g., officials in charge of one of the three areas covered) for the three intensive \ncourses. \n10.  High-Level Meeting on WTO Key Doha Development Agenda Issues, June 2004, \nOsaka. As no agreement on the framework and modalities of Doha Development Agenda \nnegotiations was reached at the Cancun Conference in September 2003, there is a need to \nreaffirm the importance of an open, rule-based multilateral trading system under WTO, and for \nassessing and reviewing the Doha Development Agenda negotiations and policy implications for \nDMCs for their further advancement. A three-day high-level meeting for actual DMC negotiators ", "    3 \nwill give them the opportunity to examine the policy aspects of key Doha Development Agenda \nissues, such as agriculture, market access, and the new areas.  With a view to contributing \nmore to WTO-related capacity-building activities, the Government of Japan will make additional \nfinancial and in-kind contributions to the high-level meeting in Osaka. \n11.  Intensive Course on Antidumping, February/March 2004, Hanoi.  Antidumping duty \nis one of the trade remedy measures under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade \n(GATT) against unfair trade practices in exporting countries.   Traditionally, Australia, Canada, \nEuropean  Union,  and  United  States  were  the  major  users  of  the  duty,  and  major  targets \nincluded the ADB region (e.g., People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and Republic of Korea). \nRecently,  DMCs started using this measure against other DMCs. There is a growing concern \nand a general recognition among DMCs that the current rules should be reviewed, and\u2014\nwherever necessary\u2014modified. The 5-day course will review current trends and developments, \nexamine major emerging issues and current rules that should be modified or created, and \nevaluate the policy implications for DMCs of possible modifications of the rules and creation of \nnew ones. \n12.  Intensive Course on Rules of Origin, September 2004, Bangkok.  The aim of non-\npreferential rules of origin is to determine a country of origin, for trade statistics,  application of a \nmost-favored nation rate of duty, and application of antidumping duties and other trade remedy \nmeasures. Customs valuation, commodity classification (or nomenclature), and rules of origin \nare the three basic customs laws. The WTO Customs Valuation Agreement and the WCO \nHarmonized System are international agreements, but no such globally agreed upon detailed \nproduct  standards  exist  for  rules of  origin.  Because  national  laws  regulate  rules  of  origin, \ndisputes  arise  as  rules  differ  from  one  country  to  another.  WCO  developed  precise  rules \napplicable to all tradable goods with some options for certain products. The rules are based on \na process criterion, a value-added criterion, or a combination of both. However, these precise \nrules have not yet been closely examined, nor have they been approved by WTO. The 5-day \ncourse will examine the precise rules developed by WCO by product sector (e.g., agriculture, \ntextiles and clothing, chemicals, machinery) to expedite the WTO negotiation process.      \n13.  Intensive  Course  on  Investment,  February  2005,  Bangkok.    Foreign  direct \ninvestment is an important financial tool for development and industrialization.  Many DMCs \ngrant tax incentives to attract such investment. Disputes occur between developed countries \nand host DMCs because no international agreements govern such incentive; only bilateral \nagreements exist. To expand trade, a multilateral framework must be established to ensure \ntransparent, stable, and predictable conditions for long-term cross-border investment.  The 5-\nday course will examine the scope and definition of transparency, nondiscrimination, modalities \nof commitments, development provisions, exceptions and balance-of-payment safeguards, and \nconsultation and settlement of disputes. Development aspects will be taken into account since \nthe issue directly relates to national development strategies of DMCs. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $450,000  to  finance  the  travel,  hotel \naccommodation, and other related expenses of the resource persons and participants. The \ndetails of the financing plan are in Appendix 2. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. ", "4 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  ERD will implement the TA in cooperation with the Government of Japan. The TA is \nexpected to begin in January 2004 and to end in  April 2005. ERD will develop a curriculum for \neach of the three courses, with the assistance of APEC, UNCTAD, WCO, and WTO. While the \nTA will finance travel and per diem, and, in certain cases, honoraria for resource persons, key \nAPEC economies are expected to send their experts at their own cost as in-kind contribution to \nthe program. ADB has been invited to all APEC meetings on WTO capacity building that monitor \nand coordinate relevant projects conducted by APEC, WTO, and bilateral agencies. \n16.  DMC participants will come from Azerbaijan; Bangladesh; Bhutan; Cambodia; People\u2019s \nRepublic of China; Fiji Islands; Hong Kong, China; India; Indonesia; Kazakhstan; Republic of \nKorea; Kyrgyz Republic; Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; Malaysia; Maldives; Mongolia; \nMyanmar;  Nepal;  Pakistan;  Papua  New  Guinea;  Philippines;  Samoa;  Singapore;  Solomon \nIslands;  Sri  Lanka;  Taipei,China;  Tajikistan;  Thailand;  Tonga;  Turkmenistan;  Uzbekistan; \nVanuatu;  and  Viet  Nam.3  Participants  will  evaluate  the  activities  through  a  structured \nquestionnaire. The proceedings for the high-level meeting will be published and the papers \npresented in the three other courses will be put on an interactive CD-ROM. The activities will be \npublicized on ADB\u2019s web site. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.
