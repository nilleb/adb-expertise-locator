INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) is the third phase of the Joint \nGovernment of Kazakhstan and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) Knowledge and Experience \nExchange Program (KEEP).1 The TA will support the delivery of demand-driven, just-in-time, \nanalytical, and technical knowledge products and services to Kazakhstan. It will help bring \ninternational best practices to the country, introduce innovations, and enhance the capacity of \nstaff working for the Government of Kazakhstan and related agencies. \n \n2.  The TA will also support the implementation of ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy (CPS), \n2017\u20132021 for Kazakhstan,2 which emphasizes the importance of enhancing the country\u2019s \nknowledge  base  to support socioeconomic  development. The  CPS  recommends  that  ADB \nexpand collaboration on knowledge sharing and capacity development under the KEEP, implying \nthe provision of policy advice and capacity building to enable the government to design and \nimplement better informed policies and reforms in priority areas. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Since 1991 when Kazakhstan became independent from the former Soviet Union, the \ncountry has transitioned from a low-income to an upper middle-income country, according to \nWorld  Bank  classifications.  In  nominal  dollar  terms,  the  country\u2019s  gross  domestic  product \nincreased fivefold, from $24.9 billion in 1991 to $133.7 billion in 2016, positioning Kazakhstan as \nthe largest economy in Central Asia. Commensurate improvements in household income and \nwelfare accompanied this rapid economic expansion. The gross domestic product per capita \nincreased from $1,512 in 1991 to $7,510 in 2016, and the share of the population below the \nnational poverty line declined from 36.0% in 1996 to 2.7% in 2016.3 \n \n4.  While Kazakhstan\u2019s economic growth achievements are noteworthy and commendable, \nthey are based primarily on expanding oil production and historically high global energy prices \nprior to 2015. Kazakhstan\u2019s oil production tripled during between 2000 and 2014, when global oil \nprices reached record-high levels, and the ensuing windfall revenues both ensured sufficient fiscal \nspace for social expenditures and endowed state-owned enterprises with resources for massive \ncapital investment.  \n \n5.  The 2007\u20132008 global financial crisis and the external shocks that hit the country in late \n2014 in relation to the lowering of international commodity prices revealed the following structural \nvulnerabilities in Kazakhstan\u2019s economic model: (i) a poorly diversified economy highly dependent \non export revenues from hydrocarbons, and the concentration of foreign direct investment in \nnatural resources; (ii) underdeveloped infrastructure, especially outside the cities of Astana and \nAlmaty; (iii) the pronounced vulnerability of the finance sector; (iv) the low degree of competition \nin the economy, restraining the development of the private sector; and (v) growing environmental \nrisks, with a large share of the economy vulnerable to the impacts of climate change.4  \n \n6.  Recognizing the country\u2019s emerging knowledge needs, in 2013, ADB and the government \nestablished the KEEP through a memorandum of understanding (MOU), which provides the \nprogram\u2019s overall framework by outlining its objective and scope, areas of focus, implementation \n                                                \n1  Each phase of the program is being financed with separate TA, jointly financed by ADB and the government. \n2  The ADB Board of Directors approved the CPS, 2017\u20132021 for Kazakhstan on 12 September 2017. \n3  The year 1996 is the earliest available data point for statistics on the national poverty line. \n4  ADB. 2017. Country Partnership Strategy: Kazakhstan, 2017\u20132021. Manila. \n ", "2 \narrangements, and monitoring and evaluation measures. The MOU also commits the parties to \ncost-share a range of activities during program implementation.5  \n \n7.  Initially, the KEEP was to be articulated in three phases for a total of $2,500,000, financed \nequally by ADB and the government. However, given Kazakhstan\u2019s strong demand for knowledge, \nby 2015, actual commitments and disbursements had already exceeded the indicative amounts \nin the MOU. Accordingly, the MOU was updated in April 2015 with a supplementary agreement \nto ensure greater flexibility and responsiveness to government needs. Moreover, to reflect the \nadditional  commitments  included  in  the  2017\u20132021  CPS  to  meet  increasing  demand,  in \nSeptember 2017 the government and ADB agreed to update the MOU further, extending its \nvalidity until December 2019, revising contributions accounting for increased financing, and \nrefining its strategic focus. The updated and indicative KEEP financing plan for 2013\u20132019 is in \nTable 1.6  \n \nTable 1: Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program Financing Plan  \n($)  \nAsian Development  Government of \nYear  Total Financing   Bank  Kazakhstan \nPhase 1 (2013\u20132015)  500,000  250,000  250,000 \nPhase 2 (2015\u20132017)  1,000,000  500,000  500,000 \nPhase 3 (2017\u20132019, indicative)  2,000,000  1,000,000  1,000,000a \nTotal  3,500,000   1,750,000   1,750,000  \na  By  November  2017,  the  Government  of  Kazakhstan  had  contributed  $500,000  to  Phase  3,  and  is  \nexpected to contribute an additional $500,000 in 2018.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n8.  The  pilot  phase  was  implemented  through  the  policy  and  advisory  TA,  the  Joint \nGovernment of Kazakhstan and ADB KEEP, Phase 1, which was approved in July 2013 and \ncompleted in December 2016.7 ADB and the government each provided $250,000. As a joint \ncommittee established under the 2013 MOU, ADB and the government scrutinized and approved \nproject proposals from government agencies channeled through the Ministry of National Economy \n(MNE). The TA project supported 10 subprojects: six analytical studies and four capacity-building \nactivities. At the TA\u2019s closing date, 99.95% of the funds were disbursed. The KEEP, Phase 1 was \nrated successful upon completion.  \n \n9.  Given the growing number of government agencies requesting knowledge support under \nthe KEEP, in late 2014 the MNE and ADB jointly agreed to design and implement the Joint \nGovernment of Kazakhstan and ADB KEEP, Phase 2.8 On 24 July 2015, ADB approved Phase 2 \nfor a total of $1 million, financed equally by ADB and the government. The expected completion \ndate is 31 March 2018. To date,  Phase 2 has supported five completed and six ongoing \nsubprojects with overall commitments for $1,142,730, awarded contracts worth $399,144, and \ndisbursements for $301,234. \n \n                                                \n5  The MOU between the government and ADB was signed on 5 June 2013. \n6  ADB and the government are currently discussing a second supplementary agreement to the MOU that is expected \nto be finalized by the middle of December 2017. \n7  ADB. 2013.

Based on feedback received from the MNE during the revision sessions, and lessons from \nimplementation during the first two program phases, the implementation of the KEEP, Phase 3 \nwill incorporate the following actions: \n(i)  ADB and the government will formulate and implement a monitoring and evaluation \nmechanism built according to mutually agreed accounting standards, including \nfrequent portfolio meetings to ensure timely corrective interventions, if needed, and \nimproved flexibility;  \n(ii)  ADB and the government will finalize an indicative list of potential subprojects, \npreferably within 1 month after the knowledge and support TA is approved\u2014the \nlist will include standby projects to allow financing on a first-come, first-served \nbasis; and \n(iii)  the TA project team will coordinate closely with ADB\u2019s Operations Services and \nFinancial Management Department to ensure expeditious consultant recruitment \nin the case of urgent subprojects involving short-term assignments (less than 30 \nworking days) and relatively small and simple subprojects in terms of disbursement \n(i.e.,  those  with  a  budget  of  less  than  $30,000  involving  only  consultants\u2019 \nremuneration and travel expenses).9  \n \n11.  To ensure the delivery of high-quality knowledge products and services under the KEEP, \nPhase 3, it is important that experienced ADB and ADB Institute (ADBI) staff are involved in all \nstages of TA implementation, from identifying potential subprojects to monitoring and supervising \ntheir  delivery.  In  this  regard,  the  TA  team  will  consult  closely  with  relevant  divisions  and \ndepartments at ADB headquarters and ADBI to encourage the provision of quality staff inputs and \nensure that such inputs are adequately recognized.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The TA is aligned with the following impacts: achieving a more competitive and inclusive \neconomy, developing human capital, and enhancing the country\u2019s institutions and governance \nsystems.10 The TA will have the following outcome: high-quality policy research through enhanced \ngovernment capacity and awareness of best practices achieved.  \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n13.  The  main TA  outputs will  fall  under  the  categories  of  policy  advisory  and  capacity \ndevelopment, including (i) policy research reports submitted, and (ii) capacity-building activities \nand learning events delivered. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n                                                \n9 This action is based on the need to ensure an adequate response to the government\u2019s emerging needs. Under the \nKEEP phases 1 and 2, individual consultants were recruited within 1.5\u20132.0 months, on average, from the time that \nthe recruitment notices were published on ADB\u2019s website to the signing of the contracts. Some assignments \nrequested by the government were short-term and associated with the urgent need to develop government \ndocuments (including concepts, proposals, and draft laws) within tight deadlines, requiring timely responses from the \nprevious KEEP TA projects. \n10  Official Site of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan.

Output 1: Policy research reports submitted. In 2017\u20132019, the TA will produce at \nleast eight bilingual policy research reports that will serve as background materials for the \ngovernment\u2019s policymaking, and submit them to the relevant government agencies by 2019. The \nKEEP Coordinating Committee (KCC) will assess the achievement of this activity and present the \nresults in the annual KCC activity reports. The KCC secretariat will confirm a list of analytical \nsubprojects with the MNE, and prepare the terms of reference (TOR) for consultants who will \nconduct respective studies. In addition, the KCC secretariat will convene four dissemination \nworkshops to discuss the main research results during the TA implementation period. \n \n15.  Output 2: Capacity-building program delivered. Four to six capacity-building events for \ngovernment and related agencies\u2019 staff will be conducted in 2017\u20132019 and reflected in the TA \nreports. The KCC secretariat will confirm the planned capacity-building subprojects with the MNE \nbefore devising the TOR for the consultants who will be in charge of the actual implementation of \nthe respective capacity-building activities.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA will finance Phase 3 of the KEEP. The TA budget is estimated at $1,500,000. ADB \nwill finance $1,000,000, and the government will finance up to $500,000. The TA will follow the \nsame reimbursable approach adopted for phases 1 and 2, based on which ADB will allocate the \ntotal amount of $1,500,000 from its Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources), \nwhere the government has already transferred its $500,000.11 The cost estimates and financing \nplans are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over a 24-month period starting in January 2018. The MNE \nwill be the TA executing agency. ADB will be responsible for supervising and monitoring the TA \nactivities (Table 2). The ministries or agencies responsible for initiating the specific subprojects \nwill be the respective implementing agencies. ADB, through its Kazakhstan Resident Mission and \nthe assistance of a program coordinator, will support the TA administration. The TA proceeds will \nbe disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from  time to time).  Counterpart  staff  at  ADB  headquarters will  contribute  to the \nmanagement of the subprojects, where necessary. The KCC, which comprises representatives \nfrom the MNE and ADB Kazakhstan Resident Mission, will oversee the implementation of the \nKEEP, Phase 3.   \n \nTable 2: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative  January 2018\u2013December 2019 \nimplementation period \nExecuting agencies  Ministry of National Economy  \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB and executing agency \n \n  Pool of Sector Experts  All methods.

The monitoring of the TA will be results-oriented. A main measurement of subproject \noutcome will be whether the government uses the recommendations emanating from the TA. The \nKCC will carry out the monitoring through its secretariat, which will coordinate closely with all \nagencies carrying out the subprojects and ensure that issues are dealt with as they arise. Under \nthe KCC\u2019s overall direction and guidance, the secretariat will prepare quarterly progress reports \nand a TA completion report. The final evaluation of the TA will be based on the performance \nindicators outlined in the design and monitoring framework. \n \n19.  The KCC will disseminate good practices and lessons learned through reports and \nworkshops, as well as ADB and government websites. The KCC will see to it that these good \npractices and lessons are adequately reflected in subsequent KEEP subprojects, and relevant \ngovernment and ADB projects. \n \n20.  Consulting  services.  ADB  will  engage  consulting  firms  and  individual  consultants \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nproject administration instructions and/or staff instructions. Disbursements will be in accordance \nwith ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nThe TA will use an estimated 60 person-months of national and 30 person-months of international \nconsulting inputs to support research, workshops, and other agreed subproject activities. The \nnature of the needed expertise and inputs will be determined case by case for each activity or \nsubproject determined and approved jointly by the MNE and ADB. The inputs of consultants as \nwell as short-term resource persons will serve to introduce international best practices; provide \nin-depth local knowledge; and advise on policy options, challenges, and the implications of \nvarious  courses  of  action.  The  selection  method  for  consultants  will  be  chosen  during \nimplementation depending on what is best suited to the respective TOR. All consultants and \nexperts will be engaged based on their expertise and proven experience in the subproject areas. \nThe detailed TOR for consultants, including duration and expected results, will be discussed and \nprepared as soon as ADB and the MNE finalize and clear the proposed subprojects. The KCC \nwill coordinate with ADB departments to engage the most experienced ADB and/or ADBI staff in \nthe implementation of the subprojects.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n21.   The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,500,000 on a reimbursable \nbasis, as discussed in para. 16, to the Government of Kazakhstan for the Joint Government of \nKazakhstan and the Asian Development Bank Knowledge and Experience Exchange Program, \nPhase 3, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n ", "6     Appendix 1 \n \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \n\u201cA more competitive and inclusive economy achieved, human capital developed, and institutions \nand governance enhanced (Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy, 2015)a  \n \nPerformance Indicators with  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks  \nOutcome       \nQuality of policy  a.
