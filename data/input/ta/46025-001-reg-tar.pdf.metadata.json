INTRODUCTION \n1.  Since 2006, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided technical assistance (TA) \nto develop and implement regional cooperation between the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) \nand Mongolia in the priority areas of transport, trade facilitation (customs cooperation and \nlogistics development), and electric power trade, achieving initial but important progress.1 The \ntwo  countries  recently  agreed  to  explore  new  areas  of  cooperation,  and  the  sanitary  and \nphytosanitary area is regarded as a new priority for cooperation. They have further agreed that \nthe joint prevention and control of transboundary animal diseases (TADs) will be an early focus. \nThis regional policy and advisory TA responds to requests from the two governments for ADB to \ncontinue to support PRC\u2013Mongolia cooperation. The fact-finding mission visited the PRC and \nMongolia on 5\u20139 March 2012 to discuss with government officials and other stakeholders the \nimpact, outcome, outputs, cost, financing arrangements, and implementation arrangements for \nthe TA. Consultations were later conducted with the two governments during a Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) workshop on sanitary and phytosanitary measures \nheld in Bangkok on 25\u201326 July 2012. Broad agreement and support was obtained for the TA. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Strategy 2020 highlights regional cooperation and integration (RCI) as one of five core \noperational areas.3 In line with the strategy, ADB will increase support for RCI to include it in at \nleast 30% of its activities. The PRC and Mongolia attach great importance to RCI. Both are \nactive in RCI initiatives, including the ADB-led CAREC Program and the United Nations-led \nGreater Tumen Initiative and Northeast Asia Economic Cooperation Forum. The PRC country \npartnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 identified regional cooperation as one of three pillars of ADB \nassistance, using ADB's RCI programs to enhance regional infrastructure connectivity, facilitate \ncross-border trade and investment, and promote regional public goods.4 The Mongolia country \npartnership strategy, 2012\u20132016 treats regional cooperation as a crosscutting theme.5 Regional \ncooperation is critically important for Mongolia as a landlocked country, offering it opportunities \nto strengthen infrastructure and trade links with its neighbors, diversify its economy, and realize \nits growth potential.  \n \n3.  The PRC and Mongolia face a common threat posed by TADs, in particular foot and \nmouth disease, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (also known as blue-ear pig \ndisease), and highly pathogenic avian influenza. The two countries share a border stretching \n4,700 kilometers. Animal husbandry plays an important role in the economic development of \nborder provinces of both countries and is vulnerable to TADs. Recurrent outbreaks in domestic \nand wild animals have caused tremendous harm to animal health and safety. They also pose \nserious threats  to  human  health  and  may  cause  huge  economic  losses. The International \nFederation  for  Animal  Health  reported  that  an  outbreak  of  foot  and  mouth  disease  from \nNovember 2010 to April 2011 in the PRC, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and Mongolia required \n                                                \n1  ADB TA supporting cooperation between the PRC and Mongolia includes (i) ADB. 2006.

Animal diseases incur costs in terms of (i) lost production, which disproportionally affects \nherders and farmers in rural and border areas who are often  economically vulnerable; (ii) \nresources needed to monitor and control outbreaks; and (iii) harm to human health and welfare. \nWhen animal diseases cross borders, as often happens, costs are even higher, and prevention \nand control become more complex and difficult. In a rapidly globalized economy, TADs can \ntrigger  trade  restrictions  on  animal  products,  especially  meat,  dairy,  and  leather  goods. \nMongolia is vulnerable to such trade restrictions because animal product exports are important \nrevenue sources for the country.  \n \n5.  The persistence and spread of TADs stem from various factors, including the migration \nof wild animals, illegal border trade in animal products, and cross-border grazing. The lack of a \ncross-border and regional mechanism for policy dialogue, information sharing, and joint action \nworsens the situation. Weak capacity for TAD control\u2014particularly in terms of surveillance, data \ncollection and analysis, laboratory testing, and community monitoring and emergency response \nin rural and border areas\u2014is another constraint on TAD prevention and control. In the PRC and \nMongolia, as in many other developing countries, veterinary services urgently need bolstering. \nTo prevent the spread of TADs across the borders, countries need to adopt effective measures \nnationally and through regional cooperation. \n \n6.  On 2 November 2011, a memorandum of understanding on animal health cooperation \nwas signed by the Bureau of Veterinary Service of the PRC\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture and by \nMongolia\u2019s Department of Veterinary and Animal Breeding. The memorandum commits the two \ncountries  to  taking  joint  efforts  to  prevent  and  control  TADs.  Both  countries  have  also \nemphasized the need to cooperate with other CAREC countries and are seeking ADB support \nfor  launching  a  regional  platform  for  cooperation  on  TAD  control  and  other  sanitary  and \nphytosanitary issues. The TA supports cooperation between the PRC and Mongolia and more \nbroadly in the CAREC in this new and important area. It will help the two countries formulate \npolicy recommendations toward establishing a regional mechanism for the joint prevention and \ncontrol  of  TADs  and  conduct  priority  capacity-building  programs.  Where  necessary  and \nappropriate, the TA will encourage and support the participation of other parties in Central Asia, \nparticularly in information exchange and knowledge sharing.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The impact will be strengthened regional cooperation to prevent and control TADs in the \nPRC, Mongolia, and more broadly in the CAREC region. The outcome will be a well-functioning \ninstitutional mechanism for cooperation to jointly prevent and control TADs in the PRC and \nMongolia. \n \n8.  The TA will contribute to the objectives of ADB\u2019s Regional Cooperation and Integration \nStrategy, particularly on promoting regional public goods (pillar 4) and facilitating cross-border \ntrade (pillar 2).7 The enhanced control of TADs will lower barriers to trade in animal products \n                                                \n6  Oxford Analytica. 2012.

The lessons and experience from the TA will benefit sanitary and phytosanitary \ncooperation now being launched as a priority activity in the CAREC trade facilitation program. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n9.  The impact and outcome will be achieved through the following outputs: \n(i)  a study report on establishing a mechanism for PRC\u2013Mongolia cooperation to \njointly  control  major  TADs,  which  will  recommend  policies  and  steps  toward \nestablishing such a mechanism and analyze the feasibility of and options for \ninvolving other countries and parties in Central Asia; \n(ii)  a manual on community-level TAD prevention and control to guide animal health \nworkers in the border communities of the two countries;  \n(iii)  enhanced capacity for TAD prevention and control in PRC and Mongolian border \nprovinces  achieved  by  preparing  a  5-year  capacity-development  plan  and \norganizing training workshops; and  \n(iv)  policy briefs and/or best practice notes for senior decision makers of the PRC \nand Mongolia. \n \n10.  The TA will   \n(i)  conduct  studies  and  organize  international  expert  seminars  to  discuss  and \nrecommend policies and steps toward establishing a PRC\u2013Mongolia cooperation \nmechanism to jointly prevent and control TADs; \n(ii)  organize consultations to help the PRC and Mongolia establish a joint working \ngroup on preventing and controlling TADs, and organize working group meetings;  \n(iii)  prepare a 5-year capacity-building plan and organize training for veterinarians \nand  other  animal  health  workers  in  border  provinces  on  priority  subjects, \nparticularly  strengthening  TAD  surveillance  and  improving  animal  health \ninformation systems; \n(iv)  prepare and distribute to communities a manual on community TAD prevention \nand control, focusing on early detection, data collection and preliminary analysis, \ndesigning and implementing community emergency responses, and information \ndissemination; and  \n(v)  organize workshops on knowledge sharing with other CAREC countries.  \n \n11.  Much of the TA budget will be spent on training, workshops, and seminars. Training \nveterinarians and animal health workers in border areas on TAD surveillance and animal health \ninformation systems is a high priority of both governments, as weak capacity in these areas is a \nmain constraint on TAD control. Workshops and seminars will be organized to (i) help the two \ngovernments agree on the best institutional mechanism for TAD control; (ii) enable the team of \ninternational and national consultants to conduct sufficient consultation to ensure that the policy \nrecommendations and operational manual they prepare fully reflect countries\u2019 needs; and (iii) \nshare experience and knowledge with other CAREC countries.  \n \n12.  The TA will help assess training needs for TAD control, formulate a 5-year capacity-\nbuilding plan, and explore partnerships for capacity building with other international and bilateral \nagencies, including the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. \nAs funding available under the TA is limited relative to needs, the TA will finance only the \nhighest-priority capacity building.  \n \n ", "4   \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $550,000, of which (i) $250,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund,8 and (ii) $250,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources).  The \ngovernments of the PRC and Mongolia will jointly provide counterpart support in the form of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  space,  support  for  training,  seminars,  and  conferences,  and  other \nadministrative and logistics services. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The TA will be implemented over 24 months from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014. \nADB will be the executing agency. The implementing agency in the PRC will be the Ministry of \nAgriculture, and, in Mongolia, the Department of Veterinary and Animal Breeding, supported by \nNational Center for Zoonotic Diseases under the Ministry of Health. Due attention will be paid to \ncoordinating and sharing information with other actors in preventing and controlling TADs, such \nas health ministries, inspection and quarantine agencies, and customs administrations. The \nMinistry of Finance in the PRC and the Ministry of Industry and Agriculture in Mongolia will \nguide  and  coordinate  TA  implementation.  Civil  society  and  community  organizations  with \ninterest and expertise in TAD prevention and control in the two countries, particularly in border \nprovinces,  will  be  engaged.  The  Financial  Sector,  Public  Management,  and  Regional \nCooperation Division of ADB\u2019s East Asia Department will administer and implement the TA in \ncollaboration with the PRC and Mongolia resident missions. Lessons from other ADB projects \nrelated  to  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  cooperation,  particularly  under  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion Economic Cooperation Program, will be applied. The monitoring and reporting of \nimplementation progress and outcome\u2014covering cost, time, risk, quality, human resources, \nprocurement,  and  communications\u2014will  be  carried  out  by  the  ADB TA  project  officer  and \nsupport team through periodic reviews in accordance with the design and monitoring framework.  \n \n15.  Advisory and technical services will require 5 person-months of international consultancy \nand 12 person-months of national. Technical resource persons will be required. The consultants \nand  resource  persons  will  be  specialists  in  epizootiology,  regional  cooperation  and  policy \ncoordination for TAD control, and institution and capacity building. Because TA activities will be \nvaried,  ADB  will  engage  consultants  and  resource  persons  as  individuals  based  on  their \nqualifications and experience and in accordance with ADB Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Appendix 3 provides the outline terms of reference for \nconsultants and resource persons. Office equipment will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time)  and  transferred  to  the \nimplementing agencies upon TA completion. TA proceeds will be disbursed in line with ADB\u2019s \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time).  The \nadvance payment facility can be used for equipment, seminars, workshops, and conferences. \n \n16.  The TA outputs, particularly study findings and recommendations, will be disseminated \nin the PRC, Mongolia, and other CAREC countries through workshops, seminars, conferences, \npublications, and the media in line with ADB procedures. Where appropriate, representatives of \nthe secretariats of other regional cooperation bodies will be invited to dissemination events.  \n \n                                                \n8  Established by ADB. \n ", "  5 \nIV.
