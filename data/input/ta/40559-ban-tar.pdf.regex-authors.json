In 2002, the Government of Bangladesh requested technical assistance (TA) to prepare a \nproject to promote human development and good governance in secondary towns of Bangladesh. \nThe Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and update for the People\u2019s Republic of \nBangladesh1 provides for such TA, proposed for ADB financing in 2006. An ADB Fact-Finding \nMission visited Bangladesh during 24 July\u20133 August 2006, and reached preliminary understanding \nwith the Government on the TA goals, purpose, scope, implementation and financing arrangements, \ncost, and terms of reference.2 The design and monitoring framework is attached as Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Bangladesh has a population of about 140 million, a quarter of whom live in urban areas. \nThe overall population grows at 1.4% per year, while the urban population increases at nearly twice \n(2.5%)3 the national rate. Should this growth continue, more than 50% of the population will become \nurbanized by the year 2030. Both pull factors (the attraction of potential employment in urban areas) \nand push factors (landlessness, stagnating rural economy, and vulnerability to frequent flooding) \nhave  been  important  in  stimulating  high  rates  of  rural-urban  migration.  If  well-managed, \nurbanization has a high potential for accelerating the pace of national poverty reduction. But, so far, \nurbanization has caused growing environmental harm and poor living conditions. The gains in \nproductivity from urbanization cannot be sustained if no appropriate steps against these negative \nconsequences are taken.    \n \n3.  Although poverty incidence decreased from 50% in 2000 to 42%4 in 2005, the absolute \nnumber  of  people  classified  as  poor  remained  virtually  unchanged.  Given  past  and  present \nurbanization trends, the absolute number of the urban poor will continue to increase significantly. \nThis points to the growing need to address urban poverty both as a new dimension of poverty \n(relative to rural poverty) and as a matter of increasing priority to poverty reduction. The initial \npoverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n4.  According to recent statistics,5 82% of the urban population have access to safe drinking \nwater. In spite of the fact that this is good coverage by developing country standard, it implies that \nmore than 6 million people in urban areas remain without access to safe water. In terms of access \nto improved sanitation, the situation has deteriorated in urban areas, coverage dropping from 71% \nto 56% within the last 10 years (footnote 4). With the exception of a limited waterborne sewerage \nsystem in Dhaka, no other urban centers have any form of sewerage systems, and only 20% of \nsolid waste is collected. For most urban residents, housing conditions are very bad. Only 25% of \nurban households live in dwellings with permanent structure. Very high land prices, insecurity of \ntenure, and lack of housing finance have handicapped the growth of the formal sector of the \nhousing market. Inadequacy of urban services is a severe hindrance to the continued development \nof urban areas, as well as to efforts to reduce poverty.  \n \n5.  Secondary towns6 (known as pourashavas) provide an important vehicle for improving living \nconditions  and  are  alternatives  to  those  who  would  otherwise  migrate  to  larger  city  centers. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. Country Strategy and Program (2006\u20132010): Bangladesh. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 30 August 2006. \n3  ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Secondary Towns Water Supply and \nSanitation Project. Manila (TA 4535-BAN, approved on 24 December 2004).  \n4  In terms of urban-rural classification, the urban poverty rate is currently estimated at about 30%, while in rural areas, \npoverty incidence stands at nearly 45%.  \n5  Government  of  Bangladesh,  United  Nations  Country  Team  Bangladesh.  2005.  Millennium  Development  Goals. \nBangladesh Progress Report. Bangladesh: United Nations and Government of Bangladesh (February). \n6  Towns and/or cities above 100,000 in population. \n ", "2   \nHowever, so far the capabilities of most pourashavas7 to provide urban services and maintain a \nhealthy urban environment have not grown in tandem with the pace of urbanization.   \n  \n6.  Progress in institutional reform, an integral part of all urban development activities, has been \nmuch slower than originally anticipated. In fact, the slow progress made on institutional reform  \nreflects poor governance and lack of accountability of pourashavas in urban management. Authority \nand powers are not delegated from pourashavas chairmen to the elected commissioners and \ncitizen groups. That has limited the scope for increasing the role of municipal councils, and ward \nand citizens committees in running municipal affairs. The results are poor performance, inefficiency, \nand lack of accountability; and weak capacity of elected commissioners, local public officials, and \ncommunity groups. Good urban governance and effective management are a prerequisite for well-\nfunctioning  cities.  Past  experience  shows  that  physical  infrastructure  improvement  cannot  be \nsustained unless the underlying governance problems are addressed first.    \n \n7.  ADB has provided substantial support to the urban development initiatives undertaken by \nthe Government, both at policy and operational levels. The urban management policy approved in \n1994 is an outcome of the policy dialogue pursued by ADB. The policy stipulates a number of \nmeasures that promote an enabling policy, institutional, and financial framework for enhanced \nurban management and strengthening of urban local government. More recently, ADB financed a \nTA to support urban governance reforms (SUGR),8 which was undertaken in conjunction with the \nUrban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement (Sector) Project (UGIIP-1) and implemented in \n2004\u20132006. The studies carried out under SUGR covered the following policy areas: (i) preparation \nof a National Urban Sector Policy containing recommendations, among others, on the approach to \nbe followed in the process and patterns of urbanization in Bangladesh; (ii) review of the existing \nholding tax system in the country and recommendations for reforms to improve the collection of \nholding taxes from public and private sector entities as well as to solve the problem of recurrent \narrears of such taxes; (iii) recommendations for amending Pourashava Ordinance (1977) to reflect \nthe need for improved local governance and better urban management; and (iv) a review of the \nGovernment\u2019s long-term strategy for municipal development and recommendations for preparing a \nmaster plan for future development of these key urban centers. The new TA will be based on the \nSUGR and identify policy recommendations for improved urban governance.  \n \n8.  On  the  operational  side,  ADB\u2019s  approach  has  recognized  the  strategic  importance  of \npourashavas in the urbanization process, and the need to ensure sound and balanced urban \ndevelopment  nationally.  Consequently,  ADB  has  provided  three  loans  for  pourashavas,  the \nSecondary Town Infrastructure Development Project (STIDP I) in 1990,9 the Secondary Towns \nInfrastructure Development Project II (STIDP II) in 1995,10 and UGIIP-1 in 2002. The approach of \nUGIIP-1 is based on the experiences of previous urban projects, adopting a performance-based \napproach and focusing on good governance as a prerequisite for funding of infrastructure facilities. \nADB is also providing support to further strengthen the participation of the urban poor in municipal \n                                                 \n7  Pourashavas are categorized for administrative purposes into three: A, B, and C on the basis of 3 years\u2019 average of \ntheir own revenue generation. There are 308 pourashavas in Bangladesh, out of which 78 belong to Category A, 63 to \nCategory B, and 163 to Category C.  Two belong to a special category.  \n8  ADB. 2002.

Other development partners involved in the urban sector are Japan, Netherlands, United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP), Department for International Development of the United \nKingdom (DFID), United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and World Bank. The World Bank has \nprimarily  focused  on  metropolitan  cities,  but  also  embarked  on  a  project  covering  smaller \nmunicipalities through the Municipal Services Project (MSP), approved in 1999 and modeled after \nADB\u2019s STIDPs. The MSP aimed to improve environmental and infrastructure service delivery in a \nlimited number of pourashavas. UNDP has provided support for livelihood improvement in the slum \nareas of selected pourashavas and is currently preparing a follow-up project with cofinancing from \nDFID.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA will assist the Government to prepare the Urban Governance and Infrastructure \nImprovement  Sector  Project  (UGIIP-2)  that,  with  the  use  of  the  performance-based  approach \nadopted by UGIIP-1, will improve the welfare of municipal residents including the urban poor, and \nenhance the quality of the urban environment of 25\u201335 secondary towns or pourashavas12 that are \nnot receiving support from UGIIP-1. The TA will also develop effective measures to improve urban \ngovernance at both national and local levels and recommend suitable modalities for supporting \nnecessary policy and institutional changes in the administrative, legal, and financial systems in \npourashavas.  \n \n11.  The outputs of the TA will be (i) a comprehensive review and refinement of the project \napproach and design of UGIIP-1; (ii) a review of progress made in implementing reforms in the \ninstitutional and legal framework of the urban sector as recommended in the TA for Supporting \nUrban Governance Reform (SUGR),13 and identification of policy recommendations for improved \nurban governance; (iii) preparation of an urban development sector strategy; (iv) feasibility studies \nof  three  sample  pourashavas;14 and  (v)  a  sector  project  proposal  for  improving  urban  local \ngovernance and infrastructure services that defines its objectives, rationale, project framework and \ncomponents, implementation arrangements, costs, and monitoring systems. \n   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The ensuing Project will be prepared as a sector project. This is to facilitate competition, \nbased on good governance entry criteria, among pourashavas for loan funds. The ensuing Project \nwill  be  implemented  in  phases. 15  The  initial  phase  of  activities  will  introduce  institutional \nstrengthening and reforms in participating pourashavas. While financing only the highest priority \nmunicipal infrastructure improvements,16 subsequently, only pourashavas that meet the criteria for \ncontinued participation in subsequent phases will be eligible for further financial assistance under \nUGIIP-2.  \n \n                                                 \n11 ADB. 2005.

Manila (TA 4707-BAN, approved on 2 December 2005 for $480,000 financed by the Poverty \nReduction Fund).  \n12 The exact number of pourashavas will be determined when the cofinancing availability has been clarified.  \n13 ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of Bangladesh for Supporting Urban Governance Reform \n(SUGR). Manila (TA 4003-BAN, approved on 28 November 2002, for $400,000).  \n14 The sample pourashavas will be selected from three categories of pourashavas, namely, category A, B, and C.  \n15 The number of phases to be applied under UGIIP-2,will be determined during the TA based on a review of the \nexperience under UGIIP-1.  \n16 Infrastructure subsectors may include roads, bridges, water supply, low-cost sanitation, solid waste management, town \ncenter development, public markets, and upgrading of low-income communities. The physical investments will be \nlimited to rehabilitation of existing urban infrastructure in accordance with the needs of each participating pourashava.  \n ", "4   \n13.   If considered feasible by the TA, pourashavas17 that meet eligibility requirements (based on \nthose applied under UGIIP-1,18 and revised under the TA) will be considered eligible for support \nunder UGIIP-2. Furthermore, the selection of pourashavas to be included in the ensuing Project will \nbe based on their ranking according to their performance in meeting the eligibility requirements as \ndeveloped by the TA and to their divisional location to ensure  balanced development.  \n \n14.  The TA will (i) review and refine, if required, the ranking criteria for pourashavas to progress \nto subsequent phase(s) of UGIIP-2, as well as criteria for subproject selection that are specific to \neach of the potential subsectors as identified by UGIIP-1; (ii) review the approach and principles \nbeing promoted under the World Bank-supported MSP and Bangladesh Municipal Development \nFund (BMDF) to ensure consistency and sustainability of the local governance reforms being \nundertaken through UGIIP-2; (iii) identify modalities for merging the Urban Management Support \nUnit  (UMSU),  established  under  UGIIP-1  and  the  Municipal  Support  Unit  (MSP)  to  ensure \nnecessary  coordination  and  guidance  of  national  urban  sector  policies  and  investments; \n(iv)  identify  options  for  establishing  sustainable  capacity development  of  pourashavas  through \nexisting government institutions, such as the National Institute of Local Government under the Local \nGovernment Division, MLGRDC; (v) identify a mechanism for enhancing the poverty focus of the \nloan project; (vi) prepare a strategic and results-based urban planning model for pourashavas; and \n(vii) based on the experience from UGIIP-1, prepare effective monitoring systems and performance \nbenchmarks to ensure  continued improvement of the financial and performance management of \npourashavas. The TA will also identify modalities for public-private partnership in the project and \noptions for viable alternatives for financing infrastructure improvement in pourashavas.  \n \n15.  Selection and eligibility criteria for pourashavas to be included in the ensuing project will be \ncarefully prepared and agreed upon with the Government during the TA. To facilitate this process, \nthe TA will prepare brief socioeconomic assessments of candidate pourashavas, indicating among \nothers  poverty  level  and  other  socioeconomic  data.  Three  eligible  pourashavas19 representing \ndifferent infrastructure needs, will be selected for detailed study and analysis.   \n \n16.  The  TA  will  review  progress  made  in  implementing  the  legal  and  institutional  reforms \nrecommended by SUGR, and facilitate formulation of urban policies and identification of priority \npolicy reform actions for improved local governance and better urban management. The TA will \nalso prepare an urban development sector study, which will mainly be based on existing studies \ni.e., SUGR, and other relevant studies. It will analyze urban sector issues, identify possibilities for \nnew and innovative approaches to urban development, and recommend areas for intervention \nwithin a medium-term time frame.  \n  \n17.  Maximum flexibility will be applied to adjust TA implementation to the change in needs and \nfurther experiences gained during implementation of UGIIP-1. The TA will coordinate closely with \nthe  TA  project,  Participation  of  the  Urban  Poor  in  Municipal  Governance  (footnote  11),  and \nincorporate lessons learned in terms of a poverty focus.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost $880,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $700,000 equivalent of \nwhich $600,000 equivalent will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund funded by \n                                                 \n17 Pourashavas are categorized, for administrative purposes, into categories A, B, and C on the basis of 3 years average \nof their own revenue generation. Category A and B pourashavas will be eligible for support under UGIIP-2. The TA will \ninclude 4-6 category C pourahavas on a pilot basis as well.  \n18 The  criteria  include  (i)  development  of  adequate  staff  structure  supported  by  detailed  terms  of  reference,  (ii) \nestablishment of town-level committee and the first meeting held, (iii) establishment of ward committees, (iv) formation \nof a gender and environment committee headed by a female ward commissioner, (v) holding tax appraisal, (vi) \npreparation of a vision paper for municipal development, (vii) establishment of a planning unit with existing municipal \nstaff as focal point, and (viii) preparation of a municipal poverty reduction plan.  \n19 The three sample pourashavas will be selected from category A, B, and C.   \n ", "  5\nthe Government of Japan, and $100,000 equivalent will be financed by the Cooperation Fund for \nthe Water Sector. The remaining $180,000 will be contributed by the Government of Bangladesh, \nand will include remuneration of counter professionals and support staff, office accommodation, and \nvenue for workshop activities. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 3. The Government has \nbeen informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing investment \nproject.   \n    \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The Local Government Engineering Department (LGED) will be the Executing Agency for \nthe TA. LGED will be responsible for coordinating, monitoring, and supporting the TA activities. The \nproject steering committee established under UGIIP-1 will provide overall guidance to the TA. The \nTA will be implemented over 12 months on an intermittent basis. To maximize the impact of the \nfindings of the Urban Development Sector Study (UDSS) on the design of UGIIP-2, the UDSS will \nstart in December 2006 and be finalized by February 2007. The remaining TA activities will be \nimplemented from April 2007 to December 2007.  \n \n20.  A team of two international and seven national consultants will be recruited to provide \nspecialist services totaling 34 person-months (9 international and 25 national). The international \nconsultants  (person-months  in  parentheses)  will  include  a  team  leader  with  expertise  in  local \ngovernment  management  (6)  and  an  institutional  development  specialist  (3).  The  national \nconsultants will include a deputy team leader with expertise in local government administration and \ninstitutional development (6), a municipal engineering specialist (3), a financial specialist (finance \nand taxation expert) (4), a project economist (3), an environmental specialist (3), a resettlement \nspecialist (2), and a social and gender development specialist (4). Additionally, two consultants will \nbe engaged on an individual basis: an international social safeguard specialist (2), and a national \nurban planner (3). The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 4.   \n \n21.  An international firm will be engaged to organize the TA activities, using the quality- and \ncost-based selection method in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The \nconsultants  may  procure  equipment  through  direct  purchase  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines. Upon TA completion, ownership of the equipment procured under the TA \nwill be transferred to LGED. \n \n22.  The consultants\u2019 reporting requirements include (i) the final draft of the Urban Development \nSector  Study  3  months  after  mobilization  of  the  individual  consultant,  (ii)  detailed  team  and \nindividual work plans within 2 weeks after mobilization of the team of consultants, (iii) an inception \nreport within 4 weeks, (iv) an interim report within 10 weeks, (v) the draft final report  within 16 \nweeks  (including  a  full  feasibility  study),  and  (vi)  a  final  report  within  24  weeks  of  TA \ncommencement,  incorporating  comments  on  the  draft  final  report  from  the  Government.  The \nconsultants will organize three workshops to obtain the views of key stakeholders on the inception, \nmidterm, and draft final reports. The final report will be prepared only after the last workshop has \nbeen held along with a tripartite review meeting of the Government, the consultant, and ADB.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $100,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund for the Water Sector, and (ii) ADB providing the \nbalance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $600,000  on  a  grant  basis  to  the  Government  of \nBangladesh for preparing the Second Urban Governance and Infrastructure Improvement Sector \nProject, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks   \nImpact      Assumptions \nImprovement in the  Increase in income- National statistics  \u2022  Project design is \nwelfare of municipal  generating  BBS reports  implemented \nresidents including the  opportunities for the  Monitoring and  effectively. \nurban poor, and  local economy  evaluation reports  \u2022  Government signs loan \nenhancing the quality    Socioeconomic survey  agreement with ADB \nof the urban  Percentage of the  and other relevant \nenvironment   population in absolute  agreements with other \npoverty reduced   aid agencies. \n   \nImproved access to \nbasic infrastructure \nservices such as \nwater, sanitation, \nsolid waste \nmanagement, and \nmunicipal facilities  \nOutcome      Assumptions \n Sector project design  Draft final report  Project performance  \u2022  Government\u2019s \nand feasibility study  submitted to  monitoring system  commitment to the \nagreed to by  Government, ADB,  reports   timely completion of the \nGovernment, ADB,  and other agencies by  Review missions     Project remains. \nand other interested  September 2007  \u2022  There is political \nagencies     stability.    \n  Aide memoire to be   \n   prepared and \n  confirmed by the \nGovernment for \nfurther processing of \nthe project after the \ncompletion of loan \nfact-finding   \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.

Infant mortality was halved and life \nexpectancy increased from 56 to 65 years. Over the past 5 years, average economic growth exceeded 5% and \npoverty incidence continued to decline (43% in 2005). Despite considerable progress, Bangladesh is still one of the \nworld\u2019s poorest nations, with average gross domestic product (GDP) per capita only marginally higher than the dollar-\na-day international poverty standard. Although poverty incidence decreased as indicated above, the absolute number \nof people classified as poor remained virtually unchanged.  \n \nRapid urbanization and steady rural-urban migration of the poor in search of employment and economic opportunities \nare inflating the urban population in Bangladesh. Results obtained from the Household Income and Expenditure \nSurvey 2000 indicated an increase in urban poverty from 29.5% in 1995/96 to 36.6% in 2000. Although unemployment \nand loss of income are the main causes of poverty, many other elements and conditions determine the causes and \nlevels of urban poverty. Specific urban conditions making life hard for poor people in towns and cities follow: (i) people \nhave no land to grow food, so they need income to buy it; (ii) mothers may walk long hours outside the home to earn \nmoney, so their children suffer from lack of child care; (iii) people who have recently moved to cities from rural villages \noften have no relations or friends who can provide support in emergencies, such as sickness or unemployment; (iv) \npoor sanitation, contaminated water and polluted air contribute to ill health; and (v) squatter or poor tenants have few \nrights and are vulnerable to intimidation  or eviction. There are two types of poverty\u2014one is lack of the capacity to pay \nfor the services provided and the other is deprivation caused by inequality and inequity prevalent in the society. \nHaving very low power to influence the decision-making process of urban planning and development activities, the \npoor generally become the helpless section of society and have struggle for mere survival and subsistence.  \n \nNearly 100% of the population have access to an improved water source.1 However, over the last few years \nthousands of tubewells have been found to be contaminated with arsenic at higher than World Health Organization-\nrecommended levels. If quality is taken into account, access to safe water drops to only 72% in rural areas and to 82% \nin urban areas. In urban areas access to improved sanitation has deteriorated from 71% to 56% during the last 10 \nyears. This is mainly due to the unbridled and unplanned urbanization that has been taking place in recent years. Solid \nwaste disposal remains an environmental sanitation hazard, especially in the urban areas.   \n \nIf the current trend of migration continues, the number of urban poor will increase significantly. Thus there is a need to \naddress the adverse impacts of unplanned and uncontrolled urbanization and promote balanced urban development. \nIn particular, the Asian Development Bank\u2019s urban strategy in Bangladesh has recognized the strategic importance of \nsecondary towns in the urbanization process and the need to promote their sound and balanced urban development. \nThe  concentration  of  population  and  activities  in  few  metropolitan  areas  has  aggravated  urban  environmental \nconditions in the absence of adequate capacities to manage urban growth.  \n \nThe national poverty strategy (NPRS) confirms that poverty reduction and accelerating the pace of social development \nare Bangladesh\u2019s most important long-term strategic goals. The NPRS builds on the policy triangle of growth, human \ndevelopment, and governance. The NPRS emphasizes that progress toward these goals would require (i) establishing \nan open and competitive environment that is conducive to private investments; (ii) raising poor people\u2019s capabilities to \nparticipate more fully in the growth process through access to better quality education, health, safe water, and \nnutrition; and most importantly; and (iii) addressing governance by improving the Government\u2019s capacity, promoting \nlocal governance, tackling corruption, enhancing access to justice for the poor, and improving security and public \norder.  \n                                                 \n1  Government of Bangladesh.

Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? The technical assistance (TA) will undertake a detailed poverty analysis. \nDuring the TA, survey data will be collected including socioeconomic and poverty-related data for the candidate \npourashavas to be included in the project. In-depth data will be collected in three selected pourashavas. The data will \ninclude income, expenditure (on basic urban services in particular), demographic trends, gender issues, health, water \nand sanitation and urban environment, the capacity of pourashavas to serve the poor and direct and indirect poverty \nimpact of improving urban services. Limited-size (qualitative) data will be combined with the survey data set. \nAdditionally, the TA will design a framework for poverty impact assessment to be undertaken by the ensuing project.  \n \nThe TA will identify the need for and types of special provisions required in the project design to enable full \nparticipation of women and the marginalized and or minority/indigenous peoples. The project preparatory TA will draw \non lessons learned from the ongoing TA, Participation of the Urban Poor in Municipal Governance, in terms of \ninvolving the poor in municipal decision making.   \n \nC.

The TA will identify the need for and types of special provisions required in the project design to \nenable full participation of women and the marginalized and or minority/indigenous people.  \n \nThe form and level of participation of various stakeholders in the ensuing project\u2019s implementation phase will be \nidentified and a participation plan will be prepared to ensure quality participation of various stakeholders.    \n \nD.  Gender Development \n  \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \nThe TA will analyze needs and suggest means to address gender concerns in activities related to good governance \nand basic infrastructure facilities. The TA will recommend ways to create scope for women\u2019s participation in project \nactivities beginning from participatory project planning to implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. The role of the \nlocal government, especially of female representatives, will be strengthened.   \n \nThe ensuing project will facilitate (i) increased efficiency of the female ward commissioners through need-based \ntraining/orientation particularly  with respect to their responsibilities for the socioeconomic development of their \nrespective constituencies; differential implications of effective participatory planning, implementation, and monitoring \non the lives of women and men living in the project areas; importance of stakeholder participation in sustaining project \nimpacts, etc.; (ii) gender mainstreaming through effective participation of stakeholders, both female and male, in \nplanning, implementing, and monitoring the project.
