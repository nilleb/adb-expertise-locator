INTRODUCTION\n1. To help the Government of Kiribati meet its twin objectives of supporting economic\ndevelopment and reducing poverty, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) included an advisory\ntechnical assistance (TA)1 to strengthen development strategies and support poverty reduction\nin Kiribati\u2019s 2001 country assistance plan. A fact-finding mission visited Kiribati in March 2001\nand  held  consultations  with  Government  officials,  representatives  of  nongovernment\norganizations,  and  other  assistance  agencies  including  Australian  Agency  for  International\nDevelopment  (AusAID)  and  New  Zealand  Official  Development  Assistance.  The  mission\nreached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, and implementation\narrangements of the TA. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Located in the central Pacific Ocean, the Republic of Kiribati consists of 33 islands with a\ntotal land area of 810 square kilometers (km2) dispersed over an exclusive economic zone of\n3.5 million km2. Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in 2001 is estimated at $500. Since\n1994, real GDP growth averaged around 2.7 percent per year. The annual population growth\nrate was 2.3 percent. As a result, the average per capita income growth was just 0.4 percent per\nyear. It represents the lowest per capita GDP among ADB\u2019s 12 Pacific developing member\ncountries.\n3. Kiribati\u2019s  economy  is  narrowly  based,  highly  vulnerable  to  external  shocks,  and\ndominated by the public sector, which accounts for 30 percent of GDP. The domestic production\nbase is limited, with copra, fish, and seaweed as the main cash-earning products. About 80\npercent of the population operates in the informal sector, which relies on copra production and\nfishing. The country is heavily dependent on fishing license fees and external grants. Kiribati\nholds sizable national reserves that can be used to respond to external shocks. The gross\nnational product is almost twice the size of the GDP, owing to large receipts from fishing license\nfees,  net  investment  income  from  its  Revenue  Equalization  Reserve  Fund  (RERF),2  and\nseafarer\u2019s remittances. These factors present challenges to the Government in determining the\nmost  appropriate  pace  and  sequencing  of  policy  reforms  in  areas  such  as  privatization,\nrestructuring and improving the performance of the public sector, and tax and tariff reforms.\n4. The problems of rapid population growth are exacerbated by the increasing number of\npeople moving to South Tarawa because of limited opportunities on the outer island. Half of the\nnational  population  of  85,0003  now  live  on  South  Tarawa.  In  South  Tarawa,  poverty  is\nincreasing, as migration into the capital continues. It is placing heavy pressure on the available\nland, on the water lens, and on the lagoon. At its densest, the population is now close to 3,000\npeople per km2 in South Tarawa and reaches 6,000 people per km2 in Betia, an industrial and\nharbor district in South Tarawa. Virtually all suitable land is used for habitation, with little left for\nfood production. Close to 40 percent of households do not have even a single member in\nregular  paid  employment.  At  the  same  time,  social  investment  has  been  insufficient,  with\nindicators of maternal and infant mortality among the worst in the Pacific. In the outer islands,\n                  \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 3 April 2000.\n2 The RERF was established by the British colonial administration in 1956 from the proceeds of phosphate mining. In\n1979, when Kiribati gained independence, the value of the fund was $35 million. At end-2000, through reinvestment\nand capital appreciation, the fund had grown to $335 million.\n3 Preliminary estimate from the 2000 population census.", "2\nthe population must cope with very limited employment and income earnings opportunities, a\nlow level of social services, and infrequent or reliable transport systems.\n5. Kiribati\u2019s  National  Development  Strategy  for  2001\u20132003,  adopted  in  October  2000,\nidentifies three policy targets: (i) public sector reform: implementation of output budgeting and\nperformance-based contracts; restructuring of government ministries to focus on core functions;\nprivatization of public enterprises, and for those remaining in the public domain, a more rigorous\nenforcement  of  commercial  management  and  budget  constraints;  and  prudent  fiscal\nmanagement; (ii) creation of an enabling environment for private sector development: increased\ncooperation between the public and private sectors; streamlining of investment approvals and\nrevision  of  incentives  to  make  them  more  market  friendly;  strengthening  of  the  domestic\nfinancial system to improve resource mobilization; improvement of access to land for investment\nand development; and continued reform of taxes and tariffs to remove distortions; and (iii)\nhuman resource development: increased emphasis on basic education, vocational technical\ntraining, primary health care, and poverty reduction. This was the first time the Government\nexplicitly acknowledged the existence of poverty and poverty issues in Kiribati.\n6. Progress in implementing the public sector reform program and the promotion of private\nsector and human resources development has been slow. A major reason for the lack of\nprogress  has  been  the  absence  of  broad  support  for  the  strategies  among  politicians,\ngovernment officials, and the community at large. This stems largely from the perception that\nthe  economic  situation  underpinned  by  the  RERF  can  provide  a  cushion  against  adverse\nshocks, which is essentially sound.\n7. The  emerging  demographic  situation  poses  one  of  the  greatest  challenges  for  the\nGovernment in the medium term. Increasing numbers of young people are entering the labor\nforce each year. In the past the phosphate mine in Nauru provided employment for many. Now\nthat the mine is nearing exhaustion, that source of employment is also drying up. To attract any\nform  of  employment-creating  investment  will  require  the  establishment  of  an  enabling\nenvironment for the private sector. Economic monitoring in Kiribati has been hampered by a\nweak database and irregular reporting system.\n8. Economic  work,  including  poverty  analysis,  and  stepped-up  efforts  to  build  social\nconsensus on reforms are necessary. The Government\u2019s ability to assess the existing situation,\nand  identify  economic  and  social  development,  constraints,  and  strategy  options  must  be\nenhanced. This will provide a basis for developing realistic medium-term government strategies\nfor strengthening its development programs and supporting the fight against poverty. It will be\nimportant  to  closely  monitor  progress  in  actual  implementation  and  make  necessary\nadjustments and improvements based on real experience.\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.  Objective\n9. The main objective of the TA is to assist Kiribati in (i) developing a comprehensive\nnational strategy and program to achieve broad-based economic growth, with corresponding\nimprovement of the quality of life of the people and poverty reduction in the country; and\n(ii) implementing the plan effectively, through intermittent expert inputs. The TA will assist the\nGovernment to", "3\n(i)  develop  a  plan  to  improve  public  sector  delivery,  support  private  sector\ndevelopment,  improve  human  resource  development,  and  achieve  economic\ndiversification involving (a) updating social and economic data; (b) assessing the\nunderlying causes of poverty and developing a  poverty profile; (c) identifying\nobstacles as well as potential opportunities for achieving broad-based growth\nand  poverty  reduction;  and  (d)  undertaking  a  consultative  and  participatory\napproach in creating awareness and identifying development strategies.\n(ii)  provide knowledge-sharing support and expert advice on an intermittent basis to\nassess performance and improve implementation of the national development\nprogram.\nB.  Scope\n10. The  TA  can  be  divided  into  two  distinct  phases:  preparation  and  planning,  and\nimplementation.\n1. Preparation and Planning\n11. The TA will help the Government undertake national poverty profiling covering South\nTarawa, as well as the outer islands.4 The national poverty profile will include proper analyses of\nthe valuation of household work and subsistence production, activities of youth, household\nincome, household expenditure, causes of poverty, effectiveness of the economic management,\naccess to basic services, and effectiveness of the safety net. It will lay the groundwork for the\npoverty partnership agreement between the Government and ADB.\n12. The  TA  will  then  assist  the  Government  to  prepare  an  overview  of  the  economy,\nfocusing on the National Development Strategy. The TA will help update macroeconomic and\ngrowth  performance;  assess  the  major  constraints  to  growth  and  poverty  reduction;  and\nexamine  the  major  sectors,  policies,  and  regulatory  environment  that  constrain  the  factor\nmarkets, including land, labor, and capital.\n13. Based on this information, the TA will assist the Government to assess the need for\npublic sector reform; constraints to private sector development; strengths and weaknesses in\nhuman resource development; and the health, education, and resource management situation.\nThen  recommendations  will  be  developed  for  the  country\u2019s  medium-term  development,\nsuggesting actions to encourage private sector development that reflects local concerns, and\nproactive measures that will help develop the subsistence economy, entrepreneurship, and\nproductive income-generating activities.\n14. This work will lead to the preparation of an economic and strategy report, which will be\npresented at the Consultative Group of Donors meeting, to be organized by ADB in mid-2002.\n                  \n4 Most of the necessary data have been collected in the 2000 Population Census and the 2001 Consumer Survey\ncarried out in South Tarawa, under Loan 1648-KIR: Sanitation, Public Health, and Environment Improvement\nProject (SAPHE), for $10.24 million, approved on 8 December 1998, and are available for analysis. The desk study\non poverty assessment and strategies for equitable growth and poverty reduction for Kiribati prepared under TA\n5907-REG: Poverty Assessment in PDMCs for $400,000, approved on 28 March 2000, will also be used as a basis\nfor this analysis. If surveys and support for data updating and processing are required, the TA will provide funds to\nsupport such activities.", "4\n2. Expert Support During Subsequent Implementation\n15. This component is based on very successful experience in Tuvalu as an example of best\npractice.5 This relates to the establishment of an advisory panel (AP) and specialist support\ngroup to assist the Government to regularly monitor performance and implement the economic\nand  social  strategy  in  the  medium  term.  The  AP\u2019s  approach  will  be  consultative  and\nparticipatory. It will involve workshops and seminars in the country with the key stakeholders. Its\nmembers  will  therefore  be  expected  to  develop  a  close,  supportive,  and  sound  working\nrelationship with the Kiribati Government leadership as well as the other stakeholders to achieve\nresults. To enhance feedback, understanding, and ownership, the AP will seek a range of views\nfrom the Government as well as private business and civil society groups. The AP will visit\nKiribati periodically, advise the Government and other ministries and responsible groups on the\nperformance  and  emerging  issues  relating  to  economic  and  social  development,  and  help\ndevelop action plans. The TA will provide services of specialist consultants on a needs basis to\nassist the Government in addressing specific issues that require assistance in this process.\nC.  Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n16. The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $680,000 equivalent, of which $524,000 is the\nforeign  exchange  cost  and  $156,000  equivalent  the  local  currency  cost.  ADB  will  provide\n$500,000 equivalent to cover $449,000 of the foreign exchange cost, and $51,000 equivalent of\nthe local currency costs. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund,\nfunded by the Government of Japan. The Government will finance the balance of the local\ncurrency  cost,  equivalent  to  $102,000,  through  the  provision  of  office  space,  conference\nfacilities, administration, and local communications. AusAID will provide parallel co-financing\n$78,000 equivalent, to cover $75,000 of the foreign exchange cost and $3,000 equivalent of the\nlocal currency cost (para. 18). The cost estimates are shown in Appendix 2.\nD.  Implementation Arrangements\n17. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MFEP) will be the Executing Agency.\nThe AP will work directly with senior staff from other ministries, including the President\u2019s Office\nand  the  ministries  of  home  affairs  and  rural  development  and  environment  and  social\ndevelopment. The Government will provide at least four senior counterpart staff for each of the\ninternational consultants, as well as office space and other support and facilities.\n18. AusAID will finance 2.5 person-months of an international human resource development\n(HRD) specialist and two international visits to Kiribati. The HRD specialist will help prepare the\npoverty profile analysis and the new economic and social report, which will be a joint ADB-\nAusAID report.\n19. ADB financing of the TA will provide a total of 14.5 person-months of international\nconsulting  services:  a  macroeconomist  (6.5  person-months),  a  HRD  specialist  (4  person-\nmonths),  a  microeconomist  (1  person-month),  and  specialist  support  personnel  (3  person-\nmonths). It will also provide a domestic economic adviser (6.5 person-months). The AP and its\nMFEP counterparts will identify specific areas and prepare detailed terms of reference for the\nspecialist support needed. Phase I will require 2.5 person-months each of the macroeconomist\nand HRD specialist, 1 person-month each of the microeconomist and economic and poverty\n                  \n5 The Tuvalu trust fund advisory committee has been assisting the Tuvalu Government since 1987 to achieve self-\nreliance and economic development.", "5\nspecialist, and 2.5 person-months of an economic adviser. Phase II will require 4 person-\nmonths each of the macroeconomist, HRD specialist, and economic adviser, and 2 person-\nmonths of specialist support personnel. The HRD specialist required in phase I will be supported\nby AusAID (para. 16). ADB will coordinate with AusAID; to ensure availability of the AusAID\nconsultant during the necessary time period.\n20. The TA will commence in January 2002 and be implemented over 36 months, with\ncompletion  expected  by  the  end  of  December  2004.  To  make  optimal  use  of  the\nrecommendations from the economic and social report, the AP (the macroeconomist and HRD\nspecialist) will visit Kiribati periodically. They will each spend one month in Kiribati in the first\nyear and two months in the second and third years, for a total of five trips lasting one month\neach.  At the end of each intermittent visit, the AP is required to present its findings and\nrecommendations  to  MFEP  and  the  other  stakeholders  including  representatives  of  the\nPresident\u2019s Office, the Cabinet, Parliament, concerned government departments, the private\nsector, nongovernment organizations, and civil society groups.\n21. The TA will produce the following outputs: (i) poverty analysis, (ii) economic and social\nreport, (iii) an economic and strategy country report for the CG meeting, (iv) the AP reports on\nthe follow-up actions, and (v) workshops/seminars on equitable growth and poverty reduction\nstrategies. The two phases (12 months and 22 months) will be separated by 2 months to enable\nthe Government, ADB, and AusAID to review the poverty profile analysis and economic and\nsocial report, and to make preliminary recommendations on the development strategies.\n22. Selection and engagement of individual consultants will follow ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the\nUse of Consultants. The Government will submit for ADB\u2019s concurrence the names of at least\nfour  candidates  with  suitable  qualifications  to  act  as  counterparts  to  the  international\nconsultants.  Equipment  items  will  be  purchased  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s Guidelines for\nProcurement and turned over to MFEP at the end of the consulting assignment. The outline\nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n23. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to the Government of the Republic of Kiribati\nin  an  amount  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $500,000  for  the  purpose  of  Strengthening\nDevelopment Strategies and Supporting Poverty Reduction, and hereby reports such action to\nthe Board.", "6 Appendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDESIGN SUMMARY PERFORMANCE MONITORING ASSUMPTIONS AND\nINDICATORS/TARGETS MECHANISMS RISKS\nGoal\nFoster equitable economic Introduction of policies that Government policies as Opportunities for\ngrowth and poverty address structural problems demonstrated by budget additional employment\nreduction. affecting the level of speeches and not found\npoverty development plans\nNatural disasters\nAdverse changes in\nexternal economic\nconditions\nLack of political will to\nmake the necessary\nchanges\nObjectives\nAssist the Government to Use of the economic and National development plan Government\nstrengthen its national social report in Government ownership and\ndevelopment strategies decisions, budgets, and Government decisions, commitment to\nthrough the following: development plans development plan implement policies\ndocuments, and budget following the poverty\nDevelop a better More comprehensive and documents profile analysis,\nunderstanding of the accurate assessment and economic and social\npoverty profile evaluation of poverty;
