This capacity development technical assistance (TA)1 was first included in the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) country operations business plan for Viet Nam, 2012\u20132014.2 The TA \nwill  support  the  National  Microfinance  Development  Strategy,  2011\u20132020,3 which  aims  to \nestablish legal, policy, regulatory, and supervisory frameworks for microfinance; enhance the \noperational capacity of microfinance institutions (MFIs); and strengthen the supervisory capacity \nin microfinance. The TA will complement ADB\u2019s ongoing Microfinance Development Program4 in \nsupporting  the  government\u2019s  policy  reform  agenda  to  improve  the  quality,  accessibility, \nefficiency,  and  competitiveness  of  microfinance  in  line  with  the  National  Microfinance \nDevelopment Strategy. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Since 2001, the Government of Viet Nam has supported the development of formal \nprivate sector MFIs to expand their outreach to low-income households nationwide, recognizing \ntheir potential to serve clients more sustainably, effectively, and efficiently than existing state-led \noperations. The government initiative to nurture regulated MFIs has been supported by ADB \nsince 2001 through a series of TA projects5 to develop a legal and supervisory framework within \nwhich  semiformal  microfinance  programs  have  been  encouraged  to  become  formal  MFIs \nlicensed and supervised by the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV).  \n \n3.  Transforming  semiformal  microfinance  programs  into  formal  MFIs  requires  that \ninstitutions and capacity be broadly upgraded in line  with the globally accepted prudential \nrequirements applicable to deposit-taking financial institutions. At the same time, capacity to \nsupervise MFIs should be adequately established to ensure high-quality microfinance services \nto existing and potential clients in need of diverse financial services. Since 2009, an ADB grant \nproject  financed  by  the  Japan  Fund  for  Poverty  Reduction  (JFPR)6 has  enhanced  the \noperational capacity of MFIs and supervisory capacity of the SBV benefiting 29 MFIs and SBV \nmicrofinance  regulators  through  12  sets  of  training  sessions  and  3  series  of  supervision \nworkshops. It also supported five MFIs\u2019 licensing to become formal deposit-taking MFIs by \nproviding supplementary matching funds for their institutional development, as required by SBV \nlicensing requirements.  \n \n4.  While  the  importance  of  training  has  been  widely  recognized,  institutionalizing  and \nsustainably conducting training remains a challenge. Operational and supervisory capacity in \nmicrofinance will need strengthening both in depth and in breadth, in theory and in practice. This \nis confirmed by the growing number of MFIs that have participated in capacity development \nunder the JFPR project (footnote 6), in response to their increasingly unmet training needs. \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section \nof ADB\u2019s website on 10 January 2013. \n2  ADB. 2011. Country Operations Business Plan: Viet Nam, 2012\u20132014.

Manila. \n ", "2 \nLikewise, the need to build supervisory capacity has risen along with the growing number of \nmicrofinance providers preparing to become formal MFIs. The completion of the JFPR project in \nDecember  2012  left  an  acute  need  to  further  roll  out  well-structured,  comprehensive \nmicrofinance training programs for both operators and supervisors.   \n \n5.  As of December 2011, clients of licensed and unlicensed MFIs amounted to only 5% of \nall  microfinance  clients.  However,  MFI  operations  have  been  growing  rapidly  with  ADB \nassistance in recent years. The JFPR project saw five MFI participants in project training and \nrecipients  of  supplementary  matching  funds  increase  their  client  numbers  by  92%,  credit \nprovision by 180%, and savings mobilized by 364% over the 2-year implementation period. \nOther MFIs participating in the JFPR project have increased their outreach to clients during the \nsame period by 20%. Although they still hold only a small share of the microfinance market, \nMFIs can grow further under the National Microfinance Development Strategy, which recognizes \nthat strengthening the operational and supervisory capacity of MFIs is a key to robust sector \ndevelopment.  \n \n6.  On 5 July 2012, ADB approved the Microfinance Development Program (MDP), which \nincludes  a  policy-based  loan  amounting  to  $40  million  for  subprogram  1,  and  policy  and \nadvisory TA amounting to $0.5 million (footnote 4). The MDP supports the development of a \nmarket-oriented microfinance sector to improve access to formal financial services for the poor, \nespecially in rural areas. It was formulated to promote fair competition among diverse financial \ninstitutions and to support the private sector\u2019s role in microfinance, thereby gradually curtailing \nthe  government\u2019s  direct  involvement.  To  this  end,  the  MDP  addresses  four  broad  areas:  \n(i)  policy  and  regulatory  reforms,  (ii)  supervisory  capacity  building,  (iii) the  operational  and \ninstitutional  development  of financial  institutions  involved  in microfinance;  and (iv) financial \ninfrastructure development. Under an improved policy and regulatory framework, strengthened \noperational  and  supervisory  capacity  will  enhance  the  sustainability  and  outreach  of \nmicrofinance services. State-owned financial institutions that lend to low-income households \nand microenterprises and are funded by the government budget will be guided to become self-\nsustaining financial institutions operating  by market principles. The MDP seeks to develop \nfinancial infrastructure through formal microfinance training, advocacy of financial literacy and \nsustainable microfinance and customer protection, and credit information exchange systems. \n \n7.  The policy and advisory TA (PATA) attached to the MDP helped the government achieve \nin  October  2012  key  policy  actions  under  subprogram  2,  which  is  scheduled  for  Board \nconsideration in 2014. The attached TA (i) helped formulate MFI regulations, (ii) studied fiscal \nand regulatory incentives for MFIs, (iii) developed a microfinance credit information exchange \nsystem, and (iv) formulated a development framework for micro insurance. To ensure effective \nand efficient MDP implementation, the government and ADB agreed that parallel TA to develop \nthe capacity of microfinance operations and supervision was necessary to complement the \nMDP\u2019s policy dialogue and the policy advice offered under the attached TA. As the National \nMicrofinance Development Strategy is implemented with broad stakeholder participation,7 such \ncapacity development TA should cover not only MFIs but other potentially sustainable financial \ninstitutions involved in microfinance, such as the Vietnam Bank for Social Policies (VBSP), the \nCentral People\u2019s Credit Fund (CCF), and people\u2019s credit funds (PCFs). Supervisory training \nshould  be  provided  as well  to  (i) the  SBV  on  prudential regulation  of financial  institutions \ninvolved  in  microfinance,  (ii)  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (MOF)  on  improved  public  finance \nmanagement through the VBSP, and (iii) the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) on \n                                                \n7  The National Microfinance Development Strategy stipulates the roles of central and provincial agencies and \norganizations. http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/42235-013-vie-oth-03.pdf ", "3 \nformulating the microfinance development policy in the context of national economic planning. \nThe  PATA  also  recognized  the  need  to  strengthen  operational  and  supervisory  capacity \nregarding micro insurance, along with the government\u2019s development policy and regulatory \nframework, both of which are being formulated under the PATA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n8.  The TA will support ongoing government efforts to develop a vibrant microfinance sector \nwith diverse financial institutions operating in a harmonized prudential environment.  \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The  impact  will  be  more  inclusive  financial  services  achieved  through  expanded \nmicrofinance.  The  outcome  will  be  enhanced  operational  and  supervisory  capacity  in \nmicrofinance.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will have four outputs: (i) training provided to MFIs, the CCF, PCFs, and the \nVBSP; (ii) training provided to the SBV, MOF, and MPI; (iii) the establishment of a formal \nmicrofinance  training  network;  and  (iv)  opportunities  for  supervisors  and  microfinance \npractitioners to share knowledge of international best practices.  \n \n11.  Training for financial institutions involved in microfinance. The TA will further roll \nout  training  under  the  previous  JFPR  grant  project  to  formalize  an  increased  number  of \nsemiformal microfinance operations. In addition to the previous syllabus, new topics like product \ndevelopment, financial literacy for clients, and social performance management will be covered \nin response to growing needs.8 Training will be conducted in partnership with existing training \ninstitutes including the Microfinance Center at the Banking Academy,9 the training institutes of \nlarge MFIs, and community-based resource centers. The training of trainers will be practiced to \nthe  extent  that  it  maximizes  training  performance.  The  TA  will  also  support  capacity \ndevelopment for micro insurance providers based on the rules and regulations formulated by the \nTA attached to the MDP (para. 7). Micro insurance training will raise awareness of the need to \npromote  micro  insurance  among  stakeholders,  improve  the  governance  structure,  and \nstrengthen  the  operational  and  institutional  capacity  of  micro  insurance  providers  to \nappropriately protect low-income policy holders against contingent risks. The TA will develop \ncapacity in the VBSP, the CCF, and PCFs toward developing sustainable market-oriented \nfinancial institutions in line with the policy actions called for by the MDP, focusing on institutional \nreform,  improved  banking  skills,  and  raising  stakeholders\u2019  awareness  of  market-oriented \nmicrofinance.  \n \n12.  Training for supervisory agencies. Supervisory training for the SBV will be based on a \nsupervision manual elaborating newly formulated implementing rules and regulations (IRRs) \npertaining to MFI operations under provisions of the Credit Institutions Law, 2010. The IRRs are \nformulated by the MDP and its attached TA and are benchmarked to the supervision standards \nof the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor and regional best practices. Training will be \n                                                \n8 The syllabus included  governance, strategic planning, business planning, financial management, risk management, \nportfolio and delinquency management, financial accounting, performance indicators and standards, financial and \nsocial performance assessment, human resource management, and business planning for formalization. \n9  The Banking Academy is a professional training and research institute in economics, finance, and banking under \nthe auspices of the SBV. Its Microfinance Center is being established with the assistance of the MDP.  ", "4 \nextended  to  central  and  provincial  institutions  alike  in  line  with  decentralized  financial \nsupervision  in  Viet  Nam.  SBV  supervisory  training  on  CCF/PCFs  will  be  based  on  newly \nformulated  IRRs  pertaining  to  provisions  of  the  Credit  Institutions  Law  on  the  CCF \ntransformation and PCF operations. The IRRs are formulated by MDP and its attached TA, \nbenchmarked to the supervision standards of the World Council of Credit Unions and regional \nbest practices. The Credit Institutions Law mandated the SBV to prudentially supervise the \nVBSP. Supervisory training for the SBV will be designed and implemented based on prudential \nrequirements applicable to the VBSP, as formulated by the MDP  and its TA. Supervisory \ntraining for the MOF will be designed and implemented from the perspective of public finance \nmanagement, and for the MPI from the perspective of macroeconomic planning. Supervisory \ntraining in micro insurance will be provided to the Insurance Supervisory Authority under the \nMOF. \n \n13.  Establishment of a formal microfinance training network. The TA will play a pivotal \nrole in establishing a national network of formal microfinance training to enhance the capacity of \nthe microfinance industry in line with globally adopted standards to secure financial soundness \nthrough profitability, liquidity, solvency, efficiency, and outreach. The TA will develop training \nmodules based on the operational and regulatory standards of the Consultative Group to Assist \nthe Poor and aligned with the Basel III Accord, the latest global prudential standards applicable \nto banks. Training modules will be published, and courses offered by the TA will be harmonized \nthrough  consultation  with  partner  training  institutes.  A  certification  system  will  be  explored \nthrough  consultations  with  stakeholders,  including  the  SBV,  the  Banking  Academy\u2019s \nMicrofinance Center, the Vietnam Microfinance Working Group, partner training institutes, MFIs, \nand financial institutions involved in microfinance, to standardize training and maintain integrity \nin the industry. \n \n14.  Knowledge-sharing opportunities for supervisors and microfinance practitioners \non  international  best  practices.  As  the  Viet  Nam  microfinance  sector  sees  state-led \noperations  gradually  transferred  to  market-oriented  financial  institutions  that  compete  with \nemerging private sector MFIs, there has emerged an acute shortage of qualified microfinance \nsupervisors  familiar  with  the  distinctive  features  of  microfinance  operations.  Learning  from \noverseas  supervision  practices  is  one  of  the  most  effective  ways  to  enhance  supervisory \ncapacity in microfinance. The TA will encourage global knowledge sharing by  providing to \nmicrofinance supervisors practical training in partnership with supervisory agencies in other \ncountries  that  have  successfully  promoted  microfinance  supervision  in  line  with  globally \nrecognized  principles.  On  their  part,  microfinance-operating  financial  institutions  can  better \nachieve their growth potential by learning good practices for operations, management, and \ngovernance in overseas markets (as the domestic sector offers few such cases) and adapting \nthe experiences of these exemplars to the national setting. The TA will promote regional and \nglobal knowledge sharing for microfinance operators and regulators alike. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,200,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and administered by ADB. The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office space, and other in-kind \ncontributions. Participating financial institutions involved in microfinance will directly finance \n$20,000 equivalent for training participation.  TA cost estimates and the financing plan are in \nAppendix 2.  \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  The executing agency will be the SBV, which will establish a project management unit to \ncoordinate TA implementing agencies and oversee implementation. The implementing agencies \nwill  be  the  SBV,  MOF,  MPI,  CCF,  and  the  MFIs  and  PCFs  whose  participation  will  be \ndetermined during implementation. The SBV\u2019s capacity to effectively and efficiently manage \nADB  loan,  technical  assistance,  and  grant  projects  has  been  proven  by  its  successful \nimplementation of past ADB assistance, including recent projects on microfinance: the JFPR \nproject Formalizing Microfinance Institutions (footnote 6) and the TA Preparing the Microfinance \nSector  Development  Program  (footnote  3).  All  implementing  agencies  have  successfully \nimplemented projects funded by international development partners including ADB. The TA will \nbegin in September 2013 and be implemented over 48 months to end in September 2017.  \n \n17.  The  TA  will  provide  18  person-months  of  international  consulting  services  and \n27 person-months of national consulting services through a consulting firm, which will monitor \nand report on the TA activities and outputs. The consulting firm will be chosen by quality- and \ncost-based  selection  using  simplified technical proposals. The  consultants  will  work  on  an \nintermittent basis, engaged in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n(2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursements under the TA will accord with ADB's \nTechnical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nEquipment  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). Appendix 3 provides the consultant terms of reference.  \n \n18.  The consultants will prepare (i) an inception report including a detailed work program to \nbe submitted within 1 month of the start of the TA and to be discussed at the initial review \nmeeting with ADB, the SBV, and the implementing agencies; (ii) quarterly progress reports;  \n(iii) a midterm report within 10 months of TA inception; (iv) a draft final report covering progress, \nTA achievements, and requirements for future assistance 1 month before TA completion; and \n(v) a final report 1 month after the receipt of comments from the government and ADB on the \ndraft final report. Training reports will be included in these reports as appropriate. Regular and \nad hoc review missions will be conducted as necessary by ADB upon endorsement of the SBV \nto monitor and report on major project activities. The government will provide inputs in kind, \nincluding staff time, facilities for TA administration, and coordination to host training and other \nevents  related  to  the  TA  activities.  Uploading  TA  outputs  to  government  websites  will  be \nundertaken and/or arranged by the SBV. An advance payment facility can be established at the \nSBV to facilitate the implementation of training and workshops under the TA. Both ADB and the \nSBV will oversee TA implementation and offer necessary inputs, coordination, and consultations \nwith stakeholders for a successful TA result. TA consultants will make inputs as outlined in, but \nnot limited to the terms of reference, to support the overall implementation of the TA. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $1,000,000  to  the \nGovernment of Viet Nam to be financed on a grant basis by the Japan Fund for Poverty \nReduction  for  Strengthening  Microfinance  Sector  Operations  and  Supervision,  and  hereby \nreports the action to the Board.
