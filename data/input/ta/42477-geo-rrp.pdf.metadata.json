The major impact of the conflict is a sharp contraction in \neconomic  growth  from  a  projected  9%  in  2008  to  3.5%, \nprecipitated  by  a  steep  decline  in  domestic  and  foreign \ninvestments.  Georgia  also  faces  a  significant  social  burden  of \nresettling over 120,000 internally displaced persons, and meeting \nthe challenge of finding jobs for over 100,000 newly unemployed. \nThere is major stress on Georgia\u2019s public finances arising from \nconsiderable  shortfalls  in  revenue  collections  and  a  decline  in \nprivatization  proceeds,  and  the  banking  system  faces  severe \nliquidity  constraints.  Infrastructure  damage  is  tangible,  but  not \nlarge.  \n \nThe Emergency Assistance for Post-Conflict Recovery (EAPCR) is \nanchored on the joint needs assessment (JNA) involving multiple \ndevelopment partners. The JNA estimates that $3.7 billion will be \nneeded for Georgia\u2019s post-conflict recovery. Out of this, $895 million \nwill be needed for the recovery efforts immediately (for the period \nuntil  March  2009),  including  $480 million  to  meet  immediate \nbudgetary needs. The JNA calls for development partner support in \nthree major areas: \n \n \n(i)  rapid restoration of confidence; \n(ii)  meeting social needs; and \n(iii)  meeting  critical  investments  to  maximize  recovery \nprospects. \n \nTo help Georgia address emergency needs under the JNA, the \nEAPCR  will  enable  the  Government  to  meet  critical  public ", "ii   \nexpenditures through the budget and help cushion the adverse \nrevenue  shocks.    The  EAPCR  will  supplement  the  Municipal \nServices  Development  Fund  Project  recently  approved  by  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB). The United States has signed an \nagreement  providing  $250  million  to  meet  critical  expenditures \nthrough the budget. The World Bank recently approved $40 million \nin budget support using the Fourth Poverty Reduction Support \nOperation.  The  European  Union  is  also  expected  to  provide \nbudgetary assistance in the near future.   \n     \nThe major outputs of the EAPCR are to ensure that: \n \n(i)  the immediate incremental expenditure needs arising from \nthe conflict are met; and \n(ii)  the core public expenditure program for 2008 is delivered \nin accordance with the approved budget.  \n \nImpact and Outcome  The EAPCR will help Georgia to revitalize its economy back to \npre-conflict levels of growth and social development. The outcome \nis adverse economic and social impact of the conflict mitigated. \n \nSpecial Features  The EAPCR is anchored on the JNA and was prepared in close \ncoordination  with  other  development  partners.  EAPCR  swiftly \nresponds to the Government\u2019s urgent request to provide it with a \ncushion  and  help  meet  immediate  and  essential  expenditures \nthrough the budget, as it adopts a counter-cyclical fiscal response \nto deal with the conflict.  \n \nTranching  The loan will be disbursed in a single tranche upon declaration of \nloan effectiveness. \n \nFinancing Plan  The  Government  has  requested  a  loan  of  Special  Drawing \nRights 46,879,000 (equivalent to $70 million) from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources for the EAPCR. The loan will carry interest at \n1% a year and a maturity of 40 years, including a grace period of \n10 years, with repayment of principal at 2% a year for the first 10 \nyears after the grace period and 4% a year thereafter.  \n \nPeriod of Utilization  The expected closing date of the loan is 30 September 2009. The \nloan is planned to be fully utilized by the Government by 31 March \n2009. \n \nExecuting Agency  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency.  \n \nDisbursement  The loan proceeds will be used to meet essential expenditure \nneeds and shall not be used to fund ineligible items under ADB\u2019s \nnegative list.   \n \nBenefits  The  adverse  impact  on  economic  growth  from  the  conflict  is \nunprecedented. The economic and social impact of the conflict is \nexerting budgetary pressures that were unexpected. The EAPCR ", "  iii\nwill  assist  the  Government  implement  countercyclical  fiscal \nmeasures aimed at preventing the economy from being locked \ninto a downward growth spiral, particularly in the context of the \nongoing global financial market turmoil.  \n \nRisks and Assumptions  While there are significant downside risks, Georgia\u2019s economy is well \npositioned to adjust to the temporary shocks of the conflict. External \nrisks include (i) the protracted global credit crisis and recession, and \n(ii) rekindling  of  regional  tensions.  Domestic  risks  include \n(i) increased  economic  difficulties  could  set  back  reforms, \n(ii) countercyclical fiscal policy insufficient to kick-start growth, and \n(iii) weakening of the banking sector. \n \nThese external risks are mitigated by several factors. First, while a \nprotracted  global  credit  crisis  will  likely  mean  a  reduction  in \nfinancial  flows  to  Georgia,  it  will  trigger  a  needed  refocus  on \nstrengthening the regulatory environment for the financial sector \nand increased reliance on internal deposit mobilization by banks. \nThe deep structural reforms of the last 4 years have increased the \nresiliency of the economy to adjust to external shocks. Second, \nconcerning the risk of increased regional tensions, intense efforts \nto reach a peaceful agreement are under way.  \n \nIn terms of mitigating factors for domestic risks, first, with regard to \nthe  risk  of  dissipation  of  reform  momentum,  the  Government \nlaunched the JNA within days of the outbreak of the conflict to \nensure that there is a clear strategy for keeping the focus on \nreforms  and  secure  the  necessary  resources  for  remaining  on \ntrack.  Second,  the  EAPCR  is  part  of  a  broader  stabilization \npackage  that  includes  the  International  Monetary  Fund,  World \nBank, and other development partners. Hence the post-conflict \nconfidence building is well coordinated and the overall impact in \nterms of ensuring the effectiveness of the countercyclical fiscal \npolicy stance is thus expected to be positive. In regard to the risk \nof weakening of the banking sector, capital requirements have \nbeen  conservative  enough  in  the  recent  past  to  allow  for  the \ncurrent  counter-cyclical  adjustments  and  JNA  development \npartners are expected to provide support to this sector.  \n \n \n \n  \n \n ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nGeorgia for the Emergency Assistance for Post-Conflict Recovery (EAPCR or the loan).1  \n \nII.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE IMPACT OF THE AUGUST 2008 CONFLICT  \n2.  Pre-Conflict Economic Performance. Over the last 5 years, Georgia has implemented \nfar-reaching macroeconomic, structural, and sector reforms that helped attract significant foreign \ndirect investment (FDI) and strengthen public finances. Economic growth, supported by surging \nFDI inflows, averaged 10.5% over 2005\u20132007 and reached 12.4% in 2007. Prior to the August \narmed conflict with the Russian Federation (August conflict or conflict), growth was forecast to slow \nto 9% (still robust) during 2008 and 2009. Appendix 2 presents a summary of the macroeconomic \nand reform progress achieved prior to the August conflict.  \n \n3.  Conflict-Related Shocks  to  Growth  Pillars. The August conflict has shaken the key \npillars  of  economic  growth  and  stability  in  Georgia.  The  shocks  include  a  steep  decline  in \nconsumer,  investor,  and  lender  confidence;  a  sharp  contraction  in  banking  system  liquidity; \nsignificant stress on public finances; 120,000 additional internally displaced persons (IDPs); and \ndamage  to  physical  infrastructure.  As  a  result,  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  growth  is \nexpected to slow down to 3.5% in 2008. Recovery could begin in the second quarter of 2009 with \nan increase in GDP growth to 4% in 2009 (Table 1 and Figure 1), but this will be contingent on the \nGovernment adopting adequate counter-cyclical fiscal measures. \n \nFigure 1: Shock to Economic Activity \n20 16\n18\n14\n16\n12\n14\n12 10\n10 8\n8\n6\n6\n4\n4\n2 2\n0 0\n2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\neconomic growth scenario pre-conflict (LHS axis)\neconomic growth scenario post-conflict (LHS axis)\nFDI (% GDP) scenario pre-conflict (RHS axis)\nFDI (% GDP) scenario post-conflict (RHS axis)\n \nGDP = gross domestic product; FDI = foreign direct investment; LHS = left-hand side; RHS = right-hand side \nSource: United Nations and World Bank. 2008.

Unless concerted and timely action is taken, the aftershocks of the August conflict could \nderail the reform momentum and deter private financial flows that have been at the heart of \nGeorgia\u2019s strong economic performance sustained over the past 5 years. A firm and coordinated \npolicy response to these risks is imperative, in the face of reemerging challenges of fiscal and \nmonetary constraints. The macroeconomic effects from the conflict are summarized in paras. 5 \nthrough 14. \n                                                 \n1 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.

Business Activity and Jobs. There has been a slowdown in construction, tourism, and \ntransport activities. In general, all businesses that depend on the banking system for credit have \nbeen seriously affected. The agriculture sector has been affected because of disruption in \nirrigation water supply from South Ossetia, Georgia and displacement of farmers in conflict-\naffected areas. The tourism sector, representing about $200 million receipts and employing \nsome 25,000 people, may face losses of up to 60% of receipts in 2008. Prior to the conflict, new \nprivate sector jobs offset job cuts from public sector reforms. The Government had estimated \nthat sustained FDI inflows would have resulted in a net increase of about 250,000 jobs over the \nnext 4\u20135 years, sufficient to decrease the unemployment rate to single-digit levels. However, \nwith output declining as a result of the conflict, 100,000 jobs are expected to be lost in 2008. \n \n6.  Fiscal Impact. The economic downturn is expected to result in a major shortfall in \nrevenue collection ($370 million for 2008) compared with the pre-conflict period. The shortfall is \nlikely  to  grow  larger  in  2009\u20132011  (Table  1).  A  multi-development  partner  joint  needs \nassessment (JNA) was carried out in September 2008 to estimate the damage and economic \nloss resulting from the conflict and to develop estimates of the financial assistance required to \nreestablish conditions for a return to sustained growth (Box 1). The JNA has estimated total \ndamages and funding requirements of over $3.7 billion. The immediate challenge that Georgia \nfaces is the rehabilitation of IDPs and maintenance of the social assistance system to protect \nthe newly enlarged group of poor and vulnerable persons. Additional spending on account of \nconflict-related costs can to some extent be offset by trimming nonessential expenditures given \nthe narrowing fiscal space. However, it is absolutely critical that the Government adopts a very \nclear countercyclical fiscal stance to reverse the ongoing economic downturn.  \n \n7.  Financial Sector Repercussions. Immediately after the conflict broke out, large US \ndollar and lari deposit withdrawals from the banking system, together with the loss of banks\u2019 \naccess to international capital markets, triggered a tightening of liquidity conditions. The sharp \nreduction  in  banks\u2019  capacity  and willingness to  lend  is affecting  economic  activity.  This  is \nexacerbated  by  weakening  consumer  demand  that  has  squeezed  the  profitability  of  many \nbusinesses, which could result in a deterioration of banks\u2019 loan portfolio quality. Already, the \nnumber of overdue loan service payments is increasing and there is risk of nonperforming loan \nratios increasing in the future. Although the situation has stabilized, the need for vigilance \ncontinues. \n \n8.  Investment Inflows. FDI inflows and related privatization revenues, as well as portfolio \ninvestment inflows, have decelerated sharply; and the effect will persist over the medium term. \nGeorgia\u2019s 5-year Eurobond spread increased from 465 basis points above US Treasury Bonds \non 6 August to 700 basis points at the peak of the conflict, and subsequently widened to 1077 \nbasis points by early October, partly as a result of heightened global risk aversion.  \n \n9.  Current Account Impact. The sharp increase in the external current account deficit \nsince 2003 reflects, to a large extent, higher imports of consumer goods as incomes increased, \nand higher imports of intermediate goods related to soaring FDI inflows. These inflows initially \nrelated to pipeline projects and subsequently broadened to other subsectors. The pre-conflict \ncurrent account deficit was financed by FDI inflows. In the post-conflict situation, the current \naccount deficit is expected to remain at around the same level but would now be financed \nincreasingly by official transfers. The high requirements of external financing remain significant \nsources  of  macroeconomic  vulnerability,  especially  in  view  of  worsening  conditions  in \ninternational debt markets. \n \n \n ", "4 \n \nBox 1: Joint Needs Assessment for Economic Recovery in Georgia \n \nOn 20 August 2008, the Government of Georgia requested the World Bank to lead an assessment of the post-conflict \nneeds to deal with the damage and economic loss that resulted from the armed conflict with the Russian Federation \n(conflict), and to develop estimates of the financial assistance required to address the losses and reestablish the \nconditions for a return to sustained growth. In response, a core team led by the World Bank, and consisting of the \nEuropean  Commission  (EC)  and  the  United  Nations  (UN)\u2014together  with  technical  sector  teams  comprising \nrepresentatives of these institutions, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), European Bank of Reconstruction and \nDevelopment,  European  Investment  Bank,  and  International  Finance  Corporation\u2014prepared  a  joint  needs \nassessment (JNA) for economic recovery.  \n \nThe JNA draws on reports prepared by the EC of initial estimates of conflict-related damages and those prepared by \nthe UN of conditions in Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia. Because of problems of access, field visits to these \nregions could not take place. The assessment of needs in these two regions is based on information and data from \nother parties, such as EC satellite imagery and assessments by the UN system. The report was guided by the post-\nconflict needs assessments methodology, which includes both (i) assessment of needs, and (ii) national prioritization \nand costing of needs in an accompanying transitional results matrix. The teams examined (i) the macroeconomic and \nbanking impact of the conflict, (ii) the impact on the social sectors and on directly and indirectly affected populations, \nand (iii) infrastructure and environment.  \n \nBecause the conflict resulted in shocks to key pillars of Georgian economic growth and financial stability, the JNA \nwas also tasked to quantify countercyclical medium-term stabilization resource requirements for Georgia to avoid a \nsharper and more protracted economic downturn. It was therefore agreed with the Government that the JNA would \nalso identify areas for new investments in order to bridge the period of a temporary decline in foreign investment (of \nuncertain duration), to provide Georgia with a basis for a rapid return to growth, and present an overall strategy for \nrecovery as well as priority actions and investments based on this strategy. \n \nThe JNA estimates that $3.7 billion from development partners will be needed for Georgia\u2019s post-conflict recovery. Of \nthis, $895 million will be needed for immediate recovery efforts, including $480 million to fund the budgetary financing \ngap. Actions required are prioritized and are presented in three sequential time frames\u2014the first of 6 months (to \nMarch 2009) (immediate); a second of a further 12 months (to March 2010); and a last phase of a further 12\u201318 \nmonths (up to September 2011), for a total of 3 years. The overall time frame is the estimated transition period where \nspecific actions will be required to bring Georgia to its normal path of growth, when extraordinary development \npartner support can end. The initial phase (of 7 months ending in March 2009) has been tailored to allow for proper \ncoordination and sequencing of the immediate humanitarian response, which is also reflected in the UN\u2019s Georgia \nCrisis Flash Appeal 2008. \n \nThe JNA identifies the need for development partner assistance in three major areas: \n \n(i) Support for the rapid restoration of confidence. Rejuvenating economic growth will be the best way that \nGeorgia can help itself. Development partners can help best by providing budget support in aid of countercyclical \nfiscal measures to ensure that critical economic and social needs are met.  \n  \n(ii) Support for social needs. The resettlement of internally displaced persons and the post-conflict needs of \naffected populations are likely to require significant support. \n \n(iii) Support for critical investments. In accordance with the JNA\u2019s assessment, certain high-value and high-yield \ninvestments are key to maximize recovery prospects. These are recognized as \u201ccore investments\u201d in the report. Such \nfinancing would also help the country enhance economic security by broadening access and connectivity in energy \nand transport spheres. \n   \nThe Government and development partners organized a Georgia Donor Conference on 22 October 2008 in Brussels, \nBelgium, under the auspices of the EC, where the Government formally sought development partner assistance \nalong the above lines. Development partners have pledged a total of $4.5 billion in support over 2008-2010, of which \n$2 billion will be in the form of grants. \n \nSources: United Nations and World Bank. 2008.

Government\u2019s Response. The Government\u2019s response on the economic and social \nfronts to the August conflict has been swift and commendable. It immediately launched efforts to \nbolster the public\u2019s confidence that there is a clear strategy to address post-conflict challenges \nand emerge with a stronger economy. The launching of the JNA within days after the conflict \nwas a key step to guide the rehabilitation and reconstruction process in a systematic manner. \nThe fiscal, monetary, and financial sector authorities have coordinated very closely. When the \nlari came under pressure in August, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) intervened to support \nthe  currency  in  accordance  with  its  managed  exchange  rate  policy  regime.  To  shore  up \nreserves depleted in defense of the lari and to bolster lari depositor confidence, the Government \nand NBG entered into a $750 million standby arrangement with the International Monetary Fund \n(IMF).  \n \n12.  To ease the liquidity squeeze faced by banks, NBG in coordination with the Financial \nSupervisory Agency adopted a countercyclical regulatory response comprising: (i) lowering \nreserve  requirements,  (ii)  lowering  the  liquidity  ratio  requirement,  (iii)  introducing  a  special \nbridge financing facility, and (iv) introducing a refinancing window to provide a new benchmark \npolicy rate.  \n \n ", "6 \n13.  Pressures are evident on the fiscal front. An amendment to the 2008 budget, submitted \nin September 2008 to Parliament, projects lower revenues than envisaged in the pre-conflict \nperiod;  lower  privatization  receipts;  higher  expenditures  as  a  result  of  the  conflict;  and  a \ndecrease in nonessential expenditures, which are insufficient to offset the decline in revenues \nand increased expenditures. Consequently, the revised estimates for the 2008 fiscal deficit are \nlarger. If development partner support is not forthcoming, the Government would be forced to \ndraw down on its cash balances at the NBG\u2014a deficit-financing source that could soon be \ndepleted. It is estimated that, with exceptional budget support of around $480 million in 2008 \nand $450 million in 2009, the Government will be able to keep the net expenditure cuts to a \nminimum  (at  the  levels  identified  in  Table  1).

ADB\u2019s Response to the August Conflict. ADB has responded swiftly in the aftermath \nof the conflict. Measures taken by ADB include:3  \n \n(i)  finalization and approval of $40 million equivalent in investment support through \nthe Municipal Services Development Fund (MDF) Project;4 \n(ii)  participation in the multi-development partner JNA exercise; \n(iii)  close  coordination  with  the  principal  development  partners  of  Georgia, \nparticularly  the  World  Bank,  IMF,  European  Union  (EU),  and  United  States, \namong others; \n(iv)  internally mobilizing an additional $70 million equivalent in Asian Development \nFund resources to meet the emergency needs in Georgia;  \n(v)  designing  the  proposed  Emergency  Assistance  for  Post-Conflict  Recovery \n(EAPCR) for Georgia. \n   \n17.

", "  9\n18.  Structure and Modality of ADB\u2019s Proposed Loan. In view of the post-conflict situation \nand the need for emergency assistance, the EAPCR combines several features, including \n \n(i)  Emergency  assistance  lending  modality.  Given  the  need  to  ensure  an \neffective and adequate counter-cyclical fiscal response as well as to meet critical \npost-conflict  transitional  safety  net  expenditures,  the  EAPCR  will  course \nassistance through the budget to help finance (a) essential economic and social \nexpenditures linked to the conflict, and (b) other essential expenditures under the \nGovernment\u2019s financing plan. As outlined above, Georgia faces significant fiscal \nstress  given  the  large  revenue  shortfall  due  to  the  adverse  business \nenvironment, conflict-related expenditures (IDPs and other economic and social \nneeds), and lower privatization receipts. Hence, ADB\u2019s emergency assistance \nloan modality that is designed to mitigate immediate losses is best suited to \nassist Georgia. The EAPCR satisfies the eligibility criteria for an emergency \nassistance loan (EAL) under ADB\u2019s Disaster and Emergency Assistance Policy \n(DEAP).5 See discussion in paras. 25\u201329 and Figure 2. \n \n(ii)  Relationship between cost and amount. The JNA identifies an exceptional \nfinancing gap of $480 million for 2008. ADB\u2019s financing of $70 million equivalent \nwill  cofinance  part  of  this  gap,  the  balance  coming  from  other  development \npartners, including the World Bank, EU, and the United States.  \n \n(iii)  Potential impact on economic, social, and governance needs identified. The \nJNA  has  undertaken  a  scenario  analysis  of  economic  and  social  outcomes \n(a) with  budget  support,  and  (b)  without  budget  support.  This  provides  the \nrationale for ADB coursing its assistance through the budget to meet critical \nexpenditures  including  conflict-related,  with  the  imperative  of  securing  better \neconomic and social outcomes.  \n \n(iv)  Full harmonization with development partners. The EAPCR is fully anchored \non the JNA, with the macroeconomic underpinnings provided by the JNA as well \nas  the  IMF\u2019s  endorsement  of  the  general  macroeconomic  directions  of  the \nGovernment, as evident in its approval of the standby arrangement. \n \n(v)  Policy dialogue. ADB has reconfirmed that critical reforms relating to public \nfinancial management, investment climate, and social protection as included in \nthe  World  Bank\u2019s  poverty  reduction  support  operation  (PRSO)  6  are  being \nsustained despite the conflict. ADB will continue to work closely with the World \nBank and other development partners to monitor the status of these reforms \n(Appendix 3). Sustained implementation of these reforms is critical for Georgia\u2019s \neconomy recovery.  \n \n(vi)  Flexibility  in  Determining  Future  Engagement.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to help support longer-term infrastructure development and to \nsustain broad-based economic and sector reforms in 2009 and beyond.  \n                                                 \n5   ADB. 2004.

Manila. \n6  The World Bank\u2019s fourth poverty reduction support operation (PRSO IV) was approved in April 2008 in the amount \nof $22.7 million equivalent, and the funds were disbursed upon effectiveness in August 2008. Following the conflict, \nthe World Bank approved a supplementary credit for $40 million equivalent in October 2008, based on the same \nagenda as in PRSO IV.  \n ", "10 \n19.  Other Recent and Ongoing Assistance. A number of other development partners have \nbeen supporting public financial management, private sector development, and social safety net \nreforms in Georgia (Appendix 4). The Government of the Netherlands supports Georgia in \nseveral areas, including governance and oversight institutions. The program of the European \nCommission  (EC)  includes  support  in  intergovernmental  fiscal  relations,  auditing,  and \nadministrative reform. The EC, together with the World Bank, has just completed the Public \nExpenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment for Georgia. The program of the \nUnited States Agency for International Development includes support in the areas of budgeting, \ntreasury  management,  governance,  anticorruption,  and  private  sector  development.  The \nprogram of the Swedish International Development Agency includes support in public sector \nand in governance reforms. The program of the United Nations Development Program includes \nsupport in the areas of administrative and civil service reforms, poverty monitoring, and financial \nsystem modernization. The program of the Department for International Development of the \nUnited Kingdom has included support in developing the medium-term expenditure framework \n(MTEF), and health sector budget management. The European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment focuses on investment promotion. German development cooperation through GTZ \nfocuses on private sector development, while KfW focuses on development of SMEs. The \nMillennium Challenge Corporation program includes rehabilitation of key regional infrastructure, \nand delivery of regional and municipal services. \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED LOAN \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n20.  The EAPCR will help Georgia revive its economy to pre-conflict levels of growth and \nsocial development, as envisaged in Georgia\u2019s long-term development strategy (2003\u20132015),7 \nand  set  forth  in  the  Government\u2019s  economic  development  and  poverty  reduction  program \n(Appendix 5). The outcome envisaged is mitigation of the adverse economic and social impact \nof the conflict.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n21.  The EAPCR will provide $70 million equivalent in immediate short-term financial support \nto help the Government address revenue shortfalls, meet the transitional safety net needs \narising from the conflict (including expenditures on social protection and IDPs) and sustain its \ncore public expenditure program (including pensions, health care for poor, and other essential \noperations and maintenance needs). The Government will combine ADB\u2019s support effectively \nwith that of other development partners and its own resources (Table 3). Following are the \nmajor outputs of the proposed EAPCR: \n \n1.  Output  1:  Ensuring  that  the  Immediate  Incremental  Expenditure  Needs \nArising from the Conflict are Met \n22.  The conflict has led to immediate additional expenditures associated with new IDPs, \ninfrastructure  reconstruction,  social  protection,  and  health  and  education,  estimated  at \n$316 million in 2008. Damages have been amplified by massive displacement of people. The \nlonger-term impacts, if not addressed, may become sizeable. Many schools are now used for \nhousing new IDPs, and more than 90 schools have suffered damage from the conflict. With \nrespect to health care, the health infrastructure in the conflict area has suffered considerably.   \n                                                 \n7 Government of Georgia. 2003. Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program. Tbilisi. ", " 11\n2.  Output 2: Ensuring that the Core Public Expenditure Program for 2008 is \nDelivered in Accordance with the Approved Budget  \n23.  The JNA includes macroeconomic scenarios with and without financial support. It shows \nthat countercyclical fiscal policy underpinned by fiscal support from development partners will \navoid a deeper and longer economic downturn. With such, GDP growth in 2009 is estimated at \n4%. However, without such support (severe impact scenario under the JNA) it is \u20137%. The \nEAPCR will help fund essential expenditures, including among others, pensions payments, IDP \nallowances, health care program for the poor, and critical operation and maintenance needs.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n24.  Consultation and Coordination. The EAPCR was prepared in close consultation with \nthe Government and development partners, and responds directly to the JNA.   \n \n25.  Quick Disbursing Support. In developing the EAPCR, ADB reviewed and considered \ntwo assistance modalities. The first was to support the ongoing PRSO-related reforms through a \nprogram loan. The second was to provide quick-disbursing support through an EAL to help meet \nessential expenditures through the budget, particularly those arising from the conflict.  \n \n26.  ADB\u2019s DEAP and Achieving Development Effectiveness in Weakly Performing Countries \n(WPC Paper)8 provide an effective and suitable framework to promptly respond to immediate \npost-conflict needs. Specifically, the overarching objective of the DEAP is to provide ADB \ndeveloping member countries in crisis with rapid funding support in the form of an EAL to rebuild \nhigh priority physical assets and restore economic, social and governance activities. The EAL \nmodality therefore enables ADB to help the Government meet transitional safety net needs as \nwell as other essential expenditures. The WPC Paper provides a flexible framework to ensure \nspeedy and effective rehabilitation in post-conflict environments.    \n \n27.  Taken together, the DEAP and WPC Paper enable ADB to effectively intervene in an \nemergency. The proposed EAPCR helps the Government achieve the objective of restoring \neconomic, social and governance activities by focusing on the Government\u2019s immediate needs \nunder the JNA. To that extent, ADB will be most effective by providing a special version of the \nEAL to restore the Government\u2019s immediate fiscal capacity to help it meet the sudden rise of \nincremental  costs  arising  from  the  conflict,  without  diverting  public  funding  from  core \nGovernment programs, particularly social services. The EAPCR will help fund expenditures \nassociated with physical and social costs arising from the conflict (emergency) and arising in \nconnection with core Government programs by ensuring that adequate budgetary resources are \navailable. The loan will also help avoid major disruption in the Government\u2019s fiscal position and \nfurther deterioration of socioeconomic conditions. Figure 3 provides an overview of the factors \nsupporting the use of the EAL modality.  \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n8  ADB. 2007.

The DEAP also encourages local procurement as a way to stimulate economic recovery \nand allows quick disbursement of EAL. The EAPCR is proposed to be released as a single \ntranche to help the Government meet essential expenditures under the revised 2008 budget, \nespecially  those  arising  from  the  conflict  (see  Table  3).  Pursuant  to  ADB  policies  and \nprocedures, the proceeds of the EAPCR will not be used to finance ineligible items, the list of \nwhich has been modified to enable ADB support to help the Government meet expenditures in \nthe local currency or for locally procured goods (see Appendix 6).9\n \n29.  To effectively apply and use assistance instruments, the DEAP permits ADB operational \npolicies to be interpreted liberally to ensure speedy and effective rehabilitation. Further, the \nWPC  Paper  allows,  with  the  approval  of  ADB\u2019s  Management  or  Board  of  Directors,  as \nappropriate, relaxation of some of ADB\u2019s existing business processes. Therefore, application of \nthe DEAP with relaxation of some of ADB\u2019s business processes and application of special \nfeatures of the EAPCR described in paras. 25 through 29 are considered appropriate.  \n  \nD.  Financing Plan \n30.  Proposed ADB Support. The Government has requested a loan of Special Drawing \nRights 46,879,000 ($70 million equivalent) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources in support for \nimplementation of the EAPCR. The loan will help the Government meet essential expenditures, \nincluding social and rehabilitation expenditures arising from the August conflict and contribute to \naddressing the current 2008 budget financing gap (Table 3).  The loan will carry interest of 1% \nper year and a maturity of 40 years, including a grace period of 10 years, with repayment of \nprincipal at 2% a year for the first 10 years after the grace period and 4% a year thereafter.  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9  As discussed in para. 26, ADB\u2019s Achieving Development Effectiveness in Weakly Performing Countries Paper \nenables flexible interpretation of ADB policies and procedures, including procedures under the DEAP. Under the \nDEAP, quick disbursement should cover only those imports necessary for an effective recovery (positive list \napproach). In contrast, the EAPCR prohibits the use of loan proceeds to fund ineligible items (negative list \napproach). ", " 13\nE.  Special Administrative Arrangements \n \n1.  EAPCR Management \n \n31.

The findings and conclusions of \nvarious assessments of Georgia\u2019s public financial management system have been incorporated \nwithin and are integral to the design of the EAPCR.10 Georgia\u2019s public expenditure management \nsystems continue to be used for budget support operations financed by the World Bank and the \nEU, and are perceived to be sufficiently robust from a fiduciary standpoint. On this basis, the \npublic financial management, control, and reporting arrangements of the Government are also \nconsidered sufficiently robust for the EAPCR. These are adequately complemented by regular \nstate budget execution reporting mechanisms to the Parliament of Georgia. During each fiscal \nyear, the Chamber of Control (COC)\u2013the supreme audit institution of Georgia\u2014undertakes an \naudit  of  all  public  expenditure  programs.  Moreover,  the  Government\u2019s  public  financial \nmanagement reforms continue to be supported under the World Bank\u2019s multi-donor funded \nPublic Sector Financial Management Reform Support Project. Since the funding is part of the \nJNA financing platform, tracking of the use of EAPCR funds will be closely linked with results \nmonitoring  under  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister.  ADB  will  also  work  closely  with  the \nGovernment and other JNA donors to monitor results, track aid to the Government under the \nJNA, and assess the impact of such aid.  \n                                                 \n10  These assessments include: World Bank.

MOF, with NBG assistance, will maintain records of all transactions between the FCA \nand  the  treasury  single  account  during  the  EAPCR\u2019s  duration,  in  accordance  with  sound \naccounting practices. ADB reserves the right to request an audit of the use of loan proceeds, \nand in addition will receive a copy of the annual audited financial statements of NBG together \nwith the audited budget execution reports for 2008 and 2009. The IMF has initiated an updated \nsafeguards assessment of NBG in connection with the recently approved standby arrangement \nwith Georgia.11 The IMF update aims to confirm the findings of the off-site monitoring and \nidentify  any  emerging  safeguards  issues.  NBG  publishes  International  Financial  Reporting \nStandards  financial  statements  that  have  been  audited  externally  in  accordance  with \ninternational standards. Thus, the overall fiduciary risks are considered acceptable, taking into \naccount the arrangements in place.  \n \nBox 2: Fiduciary Controls are an Integral Part of Georgia\u2019s Anticorruption Initiatives  \n \n  During the past 5 years, Georgia has made significant progress in addressing corruption. In 2004, \nalmost every element of the Government\u2019s reforms included an anticorruption agenda. The first step \nwas the wholesale replacement of large sections of existing state institutions. To remove the old guard \nGovernment, officials were fired or required to reapply for their old jobs. To reduce incentives for \ncorruption, salaries were raised.   \n \n  To strengthen public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency, the Government adopted and \nbegan implementing reforms that cut across public expenditure management, fiduciary activities, and \npublic  administration.  Reforms  aimed  at  strengthening  budgeting  and  expenditure  management, \nincreasing transparency and efficiency in public procurement and financial management systems, \nstrengthening  public  administration,  and  enhancing  transparency  and  accountability  of  the  public \nsector.  Reforms  include  adoption  and  implementation  of  a  medium-term  expenditure  framework, \nimplementation of a treasury single account, restructuring of the Chamber of Control into a supreme \naudit  institution,  adoption  and  implementation  of  a  national  anticorruption  strategy,  broad-based \nanticorruption monitoring, and civil service reforms, among others. Implementation of these reforms \nhelped reduce corruption. According to the World Bank Institute\u2019s Governance Indicators, Georgia\u2019s \npercentile rank for control of corruption indicator has improved from 31.6% in 2004 to 48.3% in 2007.  \n \n  Sources: World Bank. 2008.

Consistent with its commitment to good governance, accountability, and \ntransparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its agents, any alleged \ncorrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the EAPCR. To support these \nefforts, relevant provisions of ADB's Anticorruption Policy are included in the loan regulations. \n   \n                                                 \n11 IMF staff monitoring since the first safeguards assessment in 2002 indicates that NBG continues to comply with \nkey safeguard requirements. During the 2004 assessment, the IMF was encouraged by the measures taken by \nNBG  in  the  areas  of  financial  reporting,  internal  audit,  and  cash  management  to  strengthen  procedures. \nNonetheless, staff noted further room for improvement in these areas, as well as weaknesses in aspects of the \ninternal control environment of NBG, particularly in the foreign exchange management and accounting functions. \nTogether, the IMF and NBG devised and agreed on a set of measures to improve and strengthen NBG\u2019s fiduciary \narrangements. After two sets of update reviews in 2005 and 2006, the IMF was satisfied that NBG had fully \nimplemented all but three of the measures agreed upon in 2002. ", " 15\n5.  Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n38.  The  JNA  includes  transitional  results  frameworks  for  the  social  sectors,  including \nexpected  outcomes,  baseline  data,  and  priority  activities.  Relevant  baseline  indicators  and \ntargets have been incorporated into the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1). The \nOffice  of  the  Prime  Minister  will  oversee  the  overall  status  of  the  JNA.  ADB  will  closely \ncoordinate with the Government and other JNA donors on the status of targets and indicators \nunder the design and monitoring framework.  \n \nV.  EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n39.  There are several benefits to the EAPCR. First, it will help the Government meet new \nsocial  and  rehabilitation  expenditures  arising  from  the  August  conflict,  and  other  essential \nexpenditures, through the budget.  Secondly, the EAPCR aims at mitigating the impact of the \nconflict on the economy. The August conflict has resulted in a significant shock to the economic \ngrowth,  and  the  EAPCR  will  assist  the  Government  in  implementing  countercyclical  fiscal \nmeasures  aimed  at  checking  and  reversing  the  economic  downturn.  The  IMF  standby \narrangement of $750 million for 18 months provides balance of payment support and helps \nmaintain investor confidence. Indications of support from development partners have been \nsubstantial  but  these  pledges  often  take  time  to  translate  into  the  delivery  of  resources. \nTherefore, flexible and timely financing under the EAPCR is essential to address the budgetary \nneeds of the social safety net, speed up rehabilitation, and reduce the risks of the economic \ndownturn. Appendix 7 presents the summary poverty reduction and social strategy prepared for \nthe EAPCR. \n \nB.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n40.  There are currently downside risks and significant uncertainty regarding the time frame \nfor  the  Georgian  economy  to  adjust  to  this  temporary  shock.  External  risks  include  the \n(i) protracted global credit crisis and recession, and (ii) rekindling of regional tensions. Domestic \nrisks include (i) increased economic difficulties could set back reforms, (ii) countercyclical fiscal \npolicy insufficient to kick-start growth, and (iii) weakening of the banking sector. The external \nrisks are mitigated by several factors. First, while a protracted global credit crisis will likely mean \na reduction in financial flows to Georgia, it will trigger a needed refocus on strengthening the \nregulatory  environment  for  the  financial  sector  and  increased  reliance  on  internal  deposit \nmobilization by banks. The deep structural reforms of the last 4 years have increased the \nresilience of the economy to adjust to external shocks. Second, in regard to the risk of increased \nregional tensions, intense efforts to reach a peaceful settlement are underway.  \n \n41.  In terms of mitigating factors for domestic risks, first, with regard to the risk of dissipation \nof reform momentum, the Government launched the JNA within days of the outbreak of the \nconflict to ensure that there is a clear strategy for keeping the focus on reforms and that the \nnecessary resources for remaining on track are secured. Second, support proposed under the \nEAPCR is part of a broader stabilization package, which includes the IMF, the World Bank, and \nother development partners\u2014the overall impact in terms of ensuring the effectiveness of the \ncountercyclical fiscal policy stance is thus expected to be positive. In regard to the risk of \nweakening of the banking sector, earlier capital requirements were conservative enough to \nallow for the current counter-cyclical adjustments, and JNA development partners are expected \nto provide support to this sector.  \n \n ", "16 \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n42.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government has given the following specific \nassurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n \n(i)  The Government will work with ADB and other JNA development partners to \nmonitor results, track aid, and assess the impact of support under the JNA. \n(ii)  The Government shall update ADB on the implementation of the JNA and shall \nensure that necessary support is provided to ADB to review and monitor the \nstatus of key indicators under the design and monitoring framework.  \n(iii)  The Government will ensure that the loan proceeds are used for financing its \nimmediate  budgetary  expenditures  arising  from  the  conflict  and  recurrent \nbudgetary expenditures incurred after August 2008 inclusive, to sustain delivery \nof the Government\u2019s core publicly funded program, in compliance with its public \nfinance  management  procedures  and  reporting  arrangements,  and  that  such \nproceeds are not used to finance ineligible items as set forth in Appendix 6, and \nshall provide a certificate to ADB to this effect. \n(iv)  The  Government  will  furnish  to  ADB  a  certified  copy  of  the  state  budget \nexecution reports for 2008 and 2009 as submitted to the Parliament within six \nmonths after the end of the relevant fiscal year, with a certified English translation \nof the relevant parts. The Government will furnish to ADB a certified copy of the \nopinion of the Chamber of Control on such reports within eleven months after the \nend of the relevant fiscal year, with a certified English translation of the relevant \nparts. \n(v)  The Government will provide ADB with a certified copy, in the English language, \nof  the  externally  audited  annual  report  of  the  National  Bank  of  Georgia  in \naccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards for the fiscal years \n2008 and 2009 within six months after the end of the relevant fiscal year. \n(vi)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002)  and \nInvoluntary Resettlement Policy (1995) are complied with in implementation of \nactivities financed from the proceeds of the loan. \n \nVII.

In the recent past, Georgia\u2019s economy has been successful at weathering external \nshocks1 and maintaining high growth. Driven by rapidly rising foreign direct investment (FDI) \nflows, economic growth averaged 10.5% per year over the last 3 years and reached 12.4% in \n2007. This is attributable to the favorable impact of the broad and credible economic and \ngovernance reform agenda being implemented in Georgia since 2003. Over the last 5 years, \nGeorgia has implemented far-reaching strategic reforms centered on anticorruption measures \nthat have established strong mechanisms of accountability and transparency in government. \nThe reforms aim at developing a dynamic and competitive private sector as the main engine of \ngrowth, with the state playing a supportive role by providing basic public goods and services\u2014\nas seen in improvements in education and health care delivery and the introduction of a well-\ntargeted social safety net to protect the extreme poor. \n \n2.  Privatization  efforts  have  been  very  successful  in  attracting  foreign  interest  and \nsignificant capital inflows, which resulted in an expansion in economic activity in a range of non-\ntradable sectors. From financial services to wholesale and retail trade, construction, hotels and \nrestaurants, and communications, a number of service sectors benefited significantly from the \nrising household incomes and the ongoing deepening of consumer lending (Figure A2.1). In \n2007, strong inflows of FDI (Figure A2.2) and workers\u2019 remittances from abroad continued to \naccelerate the investment and consumption components of aggregate demand (Figure A2.3), \nbringing economic growth to 12.4%, and the highest rate of the last decade. \n \nFigure A2.1: Sectoral Composition of the Economy \n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n \n0 \u201889  \u201891 \u201893 \u201895 \u201897 \u201899 \u201801 \u201803 \u201805 \u201807\nManufacturing, value added (% of GDP) \nAgriculture, value added (% of GDP) \nServices, etc., value added (% of GDP) \nConstruction-related Industry, value added (% of GDP)\n \nGDP = gross domestic product. \n \nSource:  World  Development  Indicators online  database  (World  Bank, \ndownloaded 18 September 2008).   \n                                                 \n1  For example, in 2006, all exports from Georgia to the Russian Federation were banned by Russian authorities \n(e.g., wine, mineral water, and numerous agricultural products) and the Georgian economy had to cope with a \nsharp increase in the cost of imported gas from the Russian Federation. (In 2005, the Russian Federation was both \nthe leading export market and source of imports, including energy, so the disruption caused by the embargo was \nconsiderable.)

Prudent  monetary  policies  and  fiscal  reforms  since  2003  have  contributed  to \nmacroeconomic stability. The capital inflow bonanza helped finance the large current account \ndeficit, and the buildup of foreign exchange reserves cushioned against shocks affecting the \ncurrent and capital accounts of the balance of payments. In view of the significant dollarization \nof the economy and incomplete lending channels for effectiveness of traditional monetary policy \ntools,  the  Government\u2019s  main  macroeconomic  stabilization  strategy  had  been  to  pursue \nexchange rate stabilization. This was made possible by the expanding size of foreign exchange \nreserves initiated in 2003 (Figure A2.4).  \n \nFigure A2.4: Official Foreign Exchange Reserve Accumulation \n1,600,000,000  3\n1,400,000,000 \n2.5\n1,200,000,000 \n2\n1,000,000,000 \n800,000,000  1.5\n600,000,000 \n1\n400,000,000 \n0.5\n200,000,000 \n0 0\n\u201895\u201896 \u201897 \u201898 \u201899 \u201800 \u201801 \u201802 \u201803 \u201804 \u201805 \u201806 \u201807\nTotal reserves minus gold (current $) (LHS axis)\nTotal reserves in months of imports (RHS axis)\nLHS = left-hand side; RHS = right-hand side \nSource: World Development Indicators online database (World Bank, \ndownloaded 18 September 2008).  \n \n4.  Foreign equity inflows have also assisted the strong fiscal consolidation reform agenda \ninitiated  in  2003,  through  increasing  privatization  proceeds.  In  addition,  through  strong \nimprovements in tax revenue mobilization, the Government has been able to reverse its past \nrecord of recurrent failures to meet tax revenue targets, accumulation of domestic expenditure \narrears (including on pensions and wages), and cash management problems. With tax revenues \nincreasing from 14.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2003 to 25.8% of GDP in 2007, the \nGovernment\u2019s capacity to increase social spending (to more than 5% of GDP) assisted in \nestablishing  social  safety  nets,  which  the  Government  deems  crucial  for  attainment  of  its \ninclusive growth and poverty reduction agenda. Much-needed spending on priority items (e.g., \nkey infrastructural rehabilitation) also increased.  \n \n5.  Following years of sustained growth, the August conflict has resulted in an uncertain \nnear-term  outlook  for  Georgia.  Earlier  this  year,  most  forecasts  were  confident  that  the \neconomic growth trend of 8% for the past few years in Georgia would continue through 2008\u2013\n2009.  The  situation  changed  dramatically  after  the  August  2008  conflict.  The  current \nmacroeconomic outlook for Georgia is now marked by increased uncertainty. Real GDP growth \nis expected to slow down to 3.5% against the earlier envisaged 9.0% for 2008 and rise modestly \nto 4.0% in 2009 (against the forecast of 9%) (Figure A2.5). A key driver for this is the loss in \nbusiness confidence seen thus far, which in turn will affect FDI in key sectors like agriculture, \ntourism, and energy infrastructure. FDI inflows and related privatization revenues, as well as \nportfolio investment inflows, have already decelerated sharply. Direct economic damage caused \n ", "  Appendix 2  21 \nby the August conflict is estimated by the Government to cost the Georgian economy about \n$1 billion in damaged infrastructure and environment and lost fiscal revenues and output. This is \ncompounded by the consequences of erosion in consumer and investor confidence.

The trade deficit is also expected to widen further in 2008, as export prospects have \nbeen affected by short-term damage to transport and shipment infrastructure, and high energy \nprices will continue to feed into a larger import bill. Against the earlier trend (until July 2008) \nwhen surpluses in both the capital and financial account more than covered the current account \ndeficit (Figure A2.6), the sudden stop in FDI and in portfolio inflows that followed the conflict is \n(i) putting pressure on the lari, which the Government has countered in August 2008 by drawing \ndown on official foreign exchange reserves in an attempt to stabilize the exchange rate; and \n(ii) aggravating the economic slowdown through a shortage of bank credits to enterprises. \nGeorgia\u2019s 5-year Eurobond spread has widened to around 1,100 basis points above United \nStates Treasury Bonds. Continued pressure on the currency had the potential to amplify the \npass-through of high international prices of food and fuel onto domestic prices, which in view of \nthe recently ignited global economic slowdown is less likely. \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  23 \nOVERVIEW OF GOVERNMENT REFORMS THAT SUPPORT IMPLEMENTATION  \nOF THE JOINT NEEDS ASSESSMENT \n \nA.  Public Financial Management  \n1.  The Government has launched comprehensive public financial management reforms \ncentered on developing a medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) to include an explicit \nforecast of medium-term policy directions and economic conditions.1 The MTEF processes now \ncover all line ministries. Steps have also been taken toward developing results and performance \nindicators for some programs in different sectors. The Government has improved the policy \ncontent of the 2009 annual budget preparation and execution\u2014including better linking of the \nMTEF to the budget cycle, developing and implementing the MTEF-based budgetary process, \nand  increasing  focus  on  improved  efficiency  of  public  expenditures.  The  Basic  Data  and \nDirections and MTEF for 2009\u20132012 was prepared in April 2008. While the quality of the \nanalyses underpinning the policy initiatives presented in the sector strategies has improved, \nanalyses generally remain weak. However, in light of the conflict, 2009 budget ceilings and the \nBasic Data and Directions and MTEF 2010\u20132013 will be revised and formulated in accordance \nwith the outcome of the international development partner conference on Georgia held in late \nOctober 2008.  \n \n2.  In the past, Georgia faced significant problems relating to extra-budgetary revenues and \nexpenditures, manifested in weak budget execution and deviations between formulated and \nexecuted budgets. The Government introduced new accounting standards, including a fully \noperative treasury single account for the central Government and rules and guidelines for \ntreasury operations at the central and decentralized level. The Government adopted and began \nimplementation of an accounting reform strategy for producing annual consolidated financial \nstatements in accordance with internationally accepted accounting and reporting standards, and \nbegan producing consolidated cash and commitment reports for the central Government and \nlarge cities. Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) approved and the treasury service \nimplemented the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF\u2019s) Government Finance Statistics Manual \n2001 (GFSM 2001)-compliant functional budget classifications, and the treasury information \nsystem began producing reports on state budget expenditure execution according to these \nclassifications.2 The Government began producing consolidated cash and commitment reports \nfor  the  central  Government.  As  a  prerequisite  of  the  accounting  reform,  the  Government \nadopted GFSM 2001-based budget classification. Line ministries and budget organizations have \nbeen trained in the new classifications. The cash-based treasury general ledger has been \nupdated, incorporating the GFSM 2001 classification; and the 2008 budget execution report is \nbeing prepared according to the new classification. \n \n3.  There have also been significant improvements in the Treasury\u2019s rules and procedures \non cash planning and management. Improved cash management systems, together with the \nreal time settlement system linked to the National Bank of Georgia (NBG), has allowed for better \npredictability of available resources and its allocation to spending units. In addition, an electronic \npayment documents exchange system has been acquired and is currently being customized at \nthe Treasury. The electronic treasury system is now running in a pilot exploration mode and \nrespective regulations are being prepared.  \n \n4.  The Government has undertaken steps to enhance transparency and efficiency following \nthe recommendations of the country procurement assessment carried out by the World Bank in \nmid-2007.  The  Government  adopted  a  new  state  procurement  law,  created  the  State \nProcurement  Agency  (SPA),  and  established  government-wide  processes  for  transparency \n                                                 \n1  Government of Georgia. 2006.

The  SPA  website  (www.spa.ge)  provides  broad  public  dissemination  of \ninformation  about  procurement  practices.  The  Law  on  State  Procurement,  2005,  was \nsubsequently amended to include state-owned enterprises, streamline procedures, and adopt \ninternational practices of retroactive financing in public procurement. Since the adoption of the \nnew framework, public tenders have increased fivefold from 796 in 2005 to more than 3,500 in \n2007. The number is expected to rise further as the monitoring capacity of SPA increases.  \n \n5.  The Government adopted a new law on local government budgets and a transparent \nintergovernmental fiscal relations system in the budget preparation process. It continues to \nimplement the reformed system of intergovernmental fiscal transfers and the new law on local \ngovernment  budgets,  and  finalized  and  began  the  rollout  of  a  new  integrated  system  for \nmonitoring municipal budgeting and financial reporting. Until the August 2008 conflict, transfers \nwere  being  fully  funded\u2014while  the  conflict  has  reduced  the  flow,  the  Government  is  fully \ncommitted to funding. The 2008 and 2009 budgets were prepared by municipalities under the \nnew law and electronic systems for monitoring municipal expenditures have been introduced\u2014\nMOF receives monthly reports from all municipalities on the execution of their budgets. Newly \nenacted budget rules were also implemented by municipalities for the 2008 and 2009 budgets.  \n \nB.  Private Sector Development  \n6.  The Government has adopted a new tax regime that has (i) simplified the Tax Code and \nsubstantially reduced the tax burden on firms and individuals by reducing the number of taxes, \n(ii) abolished exemptions and broadened the tax base, (iii) lowered some rates to facilitate \ncompliance, and (iv) distributed the tax burden more equitably. The Government has also \ndefined mechanisms and set parameters for reviewing and assessing the implementation of the \nnew tax legislation, and introduced amendments to strengthen the effectiveness of the tax \nadministration.  As  a  result  of  these  reforms,  tax  revenues  increased  from  18%  of  gross \ndomestic product (GDP) in 2004 to 22% in 2006 and 25% in 2007. The qualitative improvement \nin tax policy has increased budget revenues and given the Government the opportunity to fund \npriority expenditures more effectively.  \n \nTable A3: Main Taxes and Tax Rates \n(%) \nTypes of Taxes  Before 2005  2005\u20132007  2008 \nIncome tax  12\u201320  12  25  \n(unified with social tax in 2008 with stepwise \nreduction  to 15% by 2011) \nSocial tax  27\u201333  20  Abolished \n(merged with personal income tax) \nCorporate (profit)  20  20  15 \ntax \nValue-added tax  20  18  18 \nCustoms duty  0\u201330  0, 5, 12  0, 5, 12 \n      Sources: ADB staff; United Nations Development Program. 2008.

The Government has further improved revenue collection administration by establishing \na unified revenue service in MOF (including merging the Tax Department, Customs Department, \nand Financial Police) and enhanced revenue services aimed at developing a culture of voluntary \ncompliance. Efforts are under way to build the necessary infrastructure of tax administration to \nimprove the quality and efficiency of taxpayer services. Regional service houses have been \nestablished to provide taxpayers with instructions and guidance, and several large tax service \ncenters are under rehabilitation.  \n \n8.  The Government adopted a new Customs Code, which simplified customs requirements \nsignificantly, reorganized and re-staffed the Customs Department, and abolished the import \ntariff on almost 91% of items; on other items, the simple unweighted import tariff fell from 7.4% \n ", "  Appendix 3  25 \nin 2004 to 1.4% in 2007. As a result of these reforms, Georgia has an open and competitive \ntrade regime. These reforms have significantly reduced the scope for corruption, and customs \nand border processing time for businesses. According to Doing Business 2008,3 the costs and \nprocedures involved in importing and exporting a standardized shipment of goods in Georgia is \nin line with practices in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) \ncountries.  Recently,  the  Government  reviewed  and  assessed  the  performance  of  the  new \nCustoms Code and made recommendations to improve performance and service standards. \nSeveral customs checkpoints have been restructured. Electronic value-added tax declarations \nhave been implemented and the ASYCUDA WORLD system4 has been operationalized in pilot \ncheckpoints. The customs methodology has also been revised. Customs procedures have been \nfurther simplified and risk-based inspection methodologies fully introduced. The Government \nintends to continue development and reporting of standard performance indicators to monitor \nperformance and the progress with the reforms.  \n \n9.  In summary, reforms have resulted in impressive increases in revenue collection. This \nhas  allowed  the  Government  to  start  addressing  basic  infrastructure  needs,  which  were \nessential to expand business opportunities. Georgia has substantially improved its rank among \nthe \u201cDoing Business\u201d indicators, rising from 114th place in 2005 to 37th place in 2006 and 18th \nplace in 2007. The 2007 Doing Business survey ranked Georgia as the number one reformer \nglobally.  Reforms  have  continued  and  Georgia  has  been  ranked  15th  in  2008.  Significant \nimprovements in the business environment were key to the surge in foreign direct investment \ninflows from under $200 million (non-oil pipeline) in 2005 to $1.5 billion in 2007.  \n \nC.  Social Protection \n10.  Payment to beneficiaries under Georgia\u2019s first targeted social assistance (TSA) program \ncommenced in August 2006. Each household was thoroughly examined and assigned a score \nof need. This database is used to target various programs for the poor and vulnerable, including \na  health  insurance  program.  Under  the  Government\u2019s  2008  budget,  GEL113.1  million  (an \nincrease over the GEL83 million budgeted for 2007) was allocated to finance the TSA. As of \nAugust  2008,  the  TSA  program  benefits  148,279  households  (12.6%  of  all  households  in \nGeorgia), with 406,718 members (10.7% of the population), which received an average monthly \nbenefit of GEL50.92 per month. The total spending on targeted income support was budgeted at \nGEL113.1 million for 2008 (0.6% of projected GDP). The August conflict with the Russian \nFederation  (conflict)  has  resulted  in  an  increase  in  the  number  of  people  requiring  social \nassistance. With regard to the population vulnerable to poverty because of the conflict, including \nthe new internally displaced persons (IDPs), the Government is planning to support qualified \npersons through the TSA. The cost of including all new extreme poor in the TSA (assuming that \nnone of them are currently benefiting) ranges from GEL1.53 million per month to GEL3.06 \nmillion per month, if the benefit level is about GEL17 per capita per month. In addition, about \n25,000 IDP households will receive one-off cash assistance. The social protection system will \ncontinue  to  face  increasing  pressures  as  economic  conditions  tighten  and  the  number  of \nunemployed and those who have lost the means to sustain their livelihoods increase.5  \n \n11.  Georgia has a universal system of income support for the elderly, where eligibility is \nconditioned upon reaching a certain age threshold (60 for women and 65 for men). Other \ncategories covered by the system are people with disabilities and families who have lost a \nbreadwinner. Benefits are flat (currently GEL70 per month) except for some special categories, \nwhich receive higher benefits (war veterans, retired officers from the army and Ministry of \n                                                 \n3   World Bank. 2007.

Washington, DC. \n4  The ASYCUDA WORLD system allows customs administrations and traders to handle most of their transactions\u2014\nfrom customs declarations to cargo manifests and transit documents\u2013via internet. \n5  In addition, to address the rise in import prices of gas and large gas tariff increases in May 2007, the Government \nput in place an energy lifeline tariff system to protect vulnerable groups and a gas subsidy. \n ", "26  Appendix 3 \n \nInterior, members of Parliament). Overall, in August 2008, 838,130 people receive pensions. \nTotal spending on pensions and special categories benefits in 2008 is budgeted at GEL773.5 \nmillion (state pensions GEL722.7 million and special allowances GEL50.8 million). The August \nconflict has not had any adverse effect on the delivery of pensions thus far. \n \n12.  The health care system in Georgia continues to face significant challenges. Health \nservice utilization rates are the lowest in Europe and Central Asia, with less than two outpatient \nvisits per capita and less than five inpatient visits per 100 people. Out of pocket expenditures for \ntreatment are a major barrier to seeking care. Only 43% of the poorest quintile seeks care for \nchronic illnesses compared to 62% of the richest quintile, and 73% of the chronically ill cite lack \nof resources as the main reason for not utilizing health services. Three million Georgians\u2014out \nof a population of 4.4 million\u2014need to cover almost three quarters of their expenditures on \nhealth services through out-of-pocket payments.6 Illness is one of the causes of falling into \npoverty,  as  10%  more  individuals  fall  below  the  poverty  line  after  incurring  hospitalization \nexpenses.  \n \n13.  The Government has launched an ambitious 4-year plan to improve equity and access \nto essential quality health services, especially for the poor and vulnerable. Specifically, the \nGovernment defined a basic benefit package of health care services with universal coverage for \nall of the population, and introduced a medical assistance program (MAP) of comprehensive \nhealth care services for the poor. All households who qualify for TSA and whose score is below \n70,000 qualify for the MAP\u2014a package of medical services provided to beneficiaries through \npublicly financed insurance premium bought through private insurance companies (currently \nGEL11 per beneficiary per month). The MAP covers (i) outpatient services not provided by the \nprimary  health  care  program;  and  (ii)  a  range  of  inpatient  services,  including  costs  of \nchemotherapy and radiation therapy, and labor and delivery costs. The program has been found \nto  increase  utilization  of  health  services  by  the  poor.  It  currently  has  about  750,000 \nbeneficiaries. In parallel, the Government increased budgetary allocations to the health care \nsector in the MTEF 2007\u20132010. For 2008, the amount budgeted is GEL75 million, about one \nthird of overall public spending on health. As a result of the conflict, the cost of providing new \nIDPs with the medical assistance package amounts to an additional GEL1 million\u2013GEL2 million \nper month, assuming the cost per capita of GEL11.2 per month. \n                                                 \n6   World Bank.

Georgia\u2019s  first  long-term  development  strategy  (2003\u20132015)  was  set  forth  in  the \nGovernment\u2019s Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program.1 The program provided \na broad framework for poverty reduction but lacked the clear prioritization needed in the face of \na limited resource envelope and the Government\u2019s capacity constraints. In 2004, a reform-\nminded  Government  came  into  power  and  ushered  in  significant  political  and  economic \ndevelopments  (the  Rose  Revolution).  The  Government\u2019s  medium-term  reform  agenda  is \nreflected in the budget document Basic Data and Directions for 2007\u20132010, which was first \ndeveloped in 2005 and updated annually since then.2 The budget document emphasizes the \nneed to improve governance and reduce corruption, and is premised on the development of a \ndynamic and competitive private sector as the main engine of growth, with the state playing a \nsupportive role by providing basic public goods and services. Complementary reforms are also \nenvisaged  to  ensure  that  the  population  benefits  from  growth  through  improvements  in \neducation and health care delivery, and the introduction of a well-targeted social safety net to \nprotect the extreme poor. These institutional and structural reforms are supported by prudential \nmacroeconomic policies.  \n \n2.  Following the presidential elections in January 2008 and the formation of a new cabinet, \nthe Government issued a 5-year program of key priorities for 2008\u20132012\u2014\u201cUnited Georgia \nwithout  Poverty,\u201d  which  was  approved  by  Parliament  on 31  January  2008.3  The  program  \nidentifies a number of economic, political, and social objectives including (i) social programs\u2014\nspending one third of the state budget to spend on social programs for the next 5 years; \n(ii) employment generation\u2014creating 200,000 new jobs over the next 5 years; and (iii) reducing \npoverty\u2014halving the number of social program beneficiaries in the next 5 years, increasing the \nminimum monthly pension to $100 over the next 5 years; and providing access to state-funded \nhealth insurance for 1.2 million people, including socially vulnerable, teachers, military and law \nenforcement personnel, and employees of state agencies.4\n \n3.  Georgia has implemented far-reaching and strategic reforms over the past 5 years with \nimpressive results. The key outcomes are as follows: \n(i)  Foreign investment doubled from 8.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2005 \nto an estimated 16% in 2006\u20132007. \n(ii)  Tax revenue collection increased from 14.1% of GDP (GEL1.2 billion) in 2003 to \n25.8% of GDP (GEL4.3 billion) in 2007. \n(iii)  Social spending by the Government increased by more than 5%. \n(iv)  Five years ago, Georgia had only 7 hours of electricity per day per household. \nToday, Georgia has electricity 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and exports \nelectricity to neighboring countries.  \n(v)  Five years ago, Georgia did not have a targeted social assistance program. \nToday,  its  program  covers  148,000  households  reaching  more  than \n600,000 beneficiaries.  \n \n                                                 \n1  Government of Georgia. 2003.

An assessment of the impact of economic growth and social spending on poverty is \nunder way. Official poverty indicators show some improvement over 2005\u20132007, with the overall \npoverty rate declining from 24.1% in 2005 to 23.3% in 2006 and 21.3% in 2007. However, the \nquality of the data is a concern, stemming partly from rapid turnover in staff in the Government\u2019s \nStatistics Department. As a cross-check, the World Bank and the Ministry of Labor and Social \nProtection conducted a living standards measurement survey in Fall 2007, and preliminary \nanalysis of the results show an overall poverty rate of 23.6% for 2007. A full poverty assessment \nin early FY2009 will discuss the differences and suggest strategic policy and investment options \nfor poverty reduction efforts going forward. However, some observations can be made at this \ntime. The rapid increase in social spending, including the introduction of the targeted social \nassistance program in 2006, has likely improved the situation of the extreme poor.  \n5.  The August conflict has resulted in an additional 130,000 internally displaced persons \n(IDPs), of which about 40,000 may not be able to return to their homes in the conflict zone. In \naddition, around 150,000 people living on farms on the agricultural plain north of Gori are \nsuffering from severe crop and livestock losses because irrigation water has been cut off and \nother conflict-related damage. Preliminary estimates point to unemployment increasing from \n13.3% in 2007 to 15.1% in 2008 and 17% in 2009. The effect on poverty is expected to be more \npronounced, with poverty increasing by 2 percentage points in 2008 and 3 percentage points in \n2009.  As  a  result,  pressures  on  social  spending  are  rising.  The  proposed  Emergency \nAssistance for Post-Conflict Recovery Loan will help address these budgetary impacts, arising \nfrom the conflict.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Government\u2019s Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program aims to raise the welfare of the population \nin Georgia. This means improving the quality of life of each person, along with the sustainable socioeconomic \ndevelopment of the country. To achieve this goal, two strategic objectives have been defined: (i) fast and sustainable \neconomic development, and (ii) reduction of poverty. To achieve these strategic objectives, the Government\u2019s priorities \ninclude (i) improvement in governance (including improvement in public administration and reduction of corruption), \n(ii) macroeconomic stability, (iii) improvement in the structural and institutional environment (including improvement in \nthe business and investment climate), (iv) development of human capital through improving health conditions, and \n(v) improving living standards for those below the poverty line and reducing vulnerability levels. \n \nThe EAPCR\u2019s outputs which are to ensure that (i) immediate incremental expenditure needs arising from the August \n2008 conflict are met, and (ii) the core Government program for 2008 is delivered in accordance with the approved \nbudget, are broadly in line with the Government\u2019s poverty reduction strategy.  \n \nThe poverty reduction strategy of the Asian Development Banka (ADB) is based on three pillars: (i) pro-poor economic \ngrowth, (ii) social development, and (iii) good governance. ADB\u2019s interim operational strategy for Georgia (2008\u2013\n2009),b  approved in January 2008, focuses on (i) improving service delivery in municipal infrastructure within the \nevolving decentralization process, (ii) reducing road transportation constraints on economic activity, and (iii) upgrading \nand  developing  energy  infrastructure.  These  priorities  were  identified  based  on  the  following  considerations: \n(i) alignment with the Government\u2019s development agenda, (ii) selectivity in focusing limited resources on a small \nnumber of priority areas, and (iii) complementarity with other development partners. The interim operational strategy \nalso highlights the need for ADB to be responsive to rapid changes in circumstances, and the flexibility of ADB \nassistance modalities\u2014a key advantage for Georgia\u2019s development under its newly established partnership with ADB. \nThe Government has requested a loan of $70 million from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources for the EAPCR. \n \nB.

As a cross-check, the World Bank and the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection \nconducted a living standards measurement survey in Fall 2007, and preliminary analysis of the results shows an \noverall poverty rate of 23.6% for 2007. A full poverty assessment in early FY2009 will discuss the differences, and \nsuggest strategic policy and investment options for poverty reduction efforts. However, some observations can be \nmade at this time. The rapid increase in social spending, including the introduction of the targeted social assistance \nprogram in 2006, has likely improved the situation of the extreme poor. Additionally, poverty appears to be more \nconcentrated in rural areas and secondary cities. \n \nThe conflict that erupted in August 2008 has resulted to an additional 130,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), of \nwhich about 40,000 may not be able to return to their homes in the conflict zone. In addition, around 150,000 people \nliving on farms on the agricultural plain north of Gori are suffering from severe crop and livestock losses because \nirrigation water was cut off and other conflict-related damage. Preliminary estimates point to unemployment increasing \nfrom 13.3% in 2007 to 15.1%\u201317.4% in 2008. The near-term outlook is of a rise in unemployment of up to 100,000. \nDepending on the severity of the economic impact of the conflict, it is estimated that around 100,000\u2013280,000 \nGeorgians may fall into poverty by the end of 2009, increasing the overall poverty incidence from 23.6% in 2007c to \n25.9%\u201330.0% and the extreme poverty incidence from 9.3% to 11.3%\u201313.4%.d People who are already poor might be \npushed deeper into poverty, thus increasing the overall poverty gap and severity of poverty. \n \nThe poverty impact estimates stem from (i) projected effects of the loss of property, productive assets, and livelihood, \nas well as the displacement that was caused by the conflict, some of which is expected to be permanent; and (ii) the \n ", "Appendix 7   33\nprojected adverse impact the conflict might have on the overall Georgian economy through a slowdown in economic \nactivities and potential loss of jobs and household incomes. The economic slowdown might cause job loss, a decrease \nin household income, and eventually a loss of a purchasing power, pushing affected households below the poverty line. \nIn the case of a severe economic slowdown, the ensuing fiscal constraints may adversely affect the Government\u2019s \nability to deliver social transfer and services, further aggravating the social situation. \n \nSocial transfers, especially pensions, play a very important role as a source of household income and contribute \nsignificantly to poverty reduction. Without pensions, the poverty incidence would increase from 23.6% to 32.9%, and \npoverty would become much deeper and more severe. Targeted social assistance reduces poverty by 2 percentage \npoints. This program is targeted well\u201471% of its beneficiaries are among the consumption poor. In addition, it \nsignificantly increases the income of poor households\u2014by 72% for all poor households, and by 105% for extreme poor \nhouseholds (10% of the population). \n \n2. Design Features \nThe EAPCR\u2019s pro-poor design includes mitigating the social impact of the August 2008 conflict. The Government\u2019s \napproach, supported by the EAPCR, is to assist the newly poor and vulnerable population through the existing social \nprotection mechanisms to the extent possible. The key elements of Georgia\u2019s social protection system are summarized \nbelow. \n \nTargeted social assistance. In August 2006, following 18 months of intense institutional development and capacity \nbuilding, the Government of Georgia introduced a targeted social assistance (TSA) system. The system uses a proxy-\nmeans testing methodology for assessing and ranking the welfare of households, which have registered with the \ndatabase on the poor and vulnerable population established and managed by the State Agency for Administration of \nSocial Transfers. The agency\u2019s database currently contains data on 42% of all households in Georgia. \n \nAll of these households had registered with the agency as households in need of support. They were visited by a \nqualified social worker who collected data on the household\u2019s economic and social status, the data was electronically \nverified and cross-checked, \u201ca score of need\u201d was automatically calculated for each household, and each household \nwas formally informed about it. Households with a score below 57,000 receive regular monthly income support. In \nAugust 2008, this benefit was received by 148,279 households with 406,718 members (10.7% of the population); the \naverage monthly benefit per household was GEL50.92. The total spending on targeted income support was budgeted \nat GEL113.1 million for 2008 (about 0.6% of projected gross domestic product). In 2007, a monitoring survey to assess \nthe performance of TSA was carried out. The survey found that TSA is efficiently administered and performs very well \nin reaching the target poor population. \n \nPensions. Georgia has a universal system of income support for the elderly, where eligibility is conditioned upon \nreaching a certain age threshold\u201460 for women and 65 for men. Other categories covered by the system are people \nwith disabilities and families that have lost a breadwinner. Benefits are flat (currently GEL70 per month), except for \nsome special categories such as war veterans, retired officers from the army and the Ministry of Interior, members of \nParliament, and others who receive much higher amounts. Overall, 838,130 people received pensions in August 2008. \nTotal spending on pensions and special categories benefits in 2008 is budgeted at GEL773.5 million (state pensions \nGEL722.7 million and special allowances GEL50.8 million). Pensions are delivered on time and the conflict has not had \nany adverse impact on their delivery so far. \n \nMedical assistance program for the poor and vulnerable. All households that are registered with the agency and \nwhose score is below 70,000 are beneficiaries of the medical assistance program. This program is essentially a \npackage of medical services provided to beneficiaries through a publicly financed insurance premium (currently \nGEL11.2  per  capita  per  month;  projected  to  increase  to  GEL15  in  2009).  Currently,  750,000  Georgians  are \nbeneficiaries of this program. The program is funded by the state budget (for 2008, the amount is budgeted at GEL75.0 \nmillion, making up about one-third of overall public spending on health in Georgia). \n \nCash payment to the internally displaced population since 1992. All 1992 IDPs\u2014about 220,000\u2014are receiving \nIDP allowance amounting to GEL25 per person per month for those residing in private housing and GEL28 per person \nper month for those placed in collective centers. \n \nSocial care services. The system of social care services in Georgia is limited and mostly focused on children deprived \nof parental care and children with disabilities. Georgia is in the process of implementing a child welfare reform aimed at \ndeinstitutionalization of child care. \n ", "34  Appendix 7 \n \nII.  SOCIAL ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Findings of Social Analysis \n \nThe social sectors in Georgia were confronted with a number of structural, institutional, policy, and governance issues \nthat needed to be addressed to improve performance and outcomes. Resources spent on social assistance programs \nwere insufficient to make a real difference to the extremely poor. Moreover, they were thinly spread over too many \nfragmented programs, targeted mostly based on status, merits (veterans and other deserving citizens), or a social \ncategory (disabled, orphans, elderly, etc.). Program implementation was weak, the staff were poorly trained and paid, \nthe record-keeping practice was outdated, benefit delivery had room for leakage, and monitoring and evaluation barely \nexisted.  \n \nEven though social transfers are not sufficient to move households out of poverty, they play an important role in \npoverty alleviation (particularly pensions as the largest program). The new Government inherited significant arrears in \npensions and other social benefit payments. In the short to medium term, major challenges facing the state pension \nsystem are (i) to continue paying pensions on time, (ii) to increase pensions to about 25%\u201330% of the average wage \n(from a replacement rate of about 20%), and (iii) to improve pension administration. In the long run, Georgia faces a \nchallenge of developing an affordable, fiscally sustainable, diversified pension system that would protect the elderly \nagainst poverty and provide for consumption smoothing. Under the new Government\u2019s program, pensions and social \nassistance benefits were significantly increased, all arrears were cleared, and payment of these benefits commenced \non a regular basis. In pensions, a strategy for long-term pension reform was adopted, and the corresponding legal \nframework was created for an affordable, equitable, and fiscally sustainable protection of the elderly against poverty. \nOverall, the pension system was simplified and streamlined. \n \nThe health sector continues to face significant challenges. Health outcomes are stagnant or are worsening. Early \nchildhood mortality and maternal mortality have yet to show a positive trend. Noncommunicable diseases are on the \nrise. Out-of-pocket expenditures for treatment are still a major barrier to seeking care. The new Government\u2019s program \naims to sustain improved health care services. Increased public financing for health care and better targeting of primary \ncare to the poor are gradually improving the utilization of health care services.  \n \nThe impact of the conflict on Georgians living in the conflict-affected areas has been considerable. Their lives have \nsuddenly been uprooted and the future is uncertain for many of them. Damages have been amplified by the massive \ndisplacement of people. The longer-term impacts, if not addressed promptly, may be sizeable. Human capital and the \ncountry\u2019s social fabric could be weakened and private sector activity in the affected areas severely hampered. Those \nalready poor might fall deeper into poverty, and many of the newly vulnerable may become poor. The affected \npopulation is largely rural and poor. As with the rest of the population, the poor will be supported through the targeted \nsocial assistance program; it is important that equity considerations require identical treatment of the poor. The conflict \nled to a rise in the number requiring social assistance, thereby adding to the administrative burden. It is estimated that \nan additional 100,000 people who have been affected by the conflict, directly or indirectly, are now vulnerable and thus \nin need of social protection assistance. A possible economic deceleration, combined with increasing food prices, would \nlead to a deepening of poverty and food insecurity among the vulnerable. The costs of the targeted social assistance \nprogram will rise and the proposed assistance will help address these budgetary impacts. \n \nB.  Consultation and Participation \n1.

MONITORING AND EVALUATION \nAre social indicators included in the design and monitoring framework to facilitate monitoring of social development \nactivities and/or social impacts during project implementation?      Yes         No      \na  ADB. 2004. Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy of the Asian Development Bank. \nManila.  \nb  ADB. 2008. Georgia: Interim Operational Strategy 2008-2009. Manila. \nc  Using consumption as a welfare indicator and following World Bank methodology for poverty measurement, 23.6% of \nGeorgians were found to be poor and 9.3% very poor. The rural population was poorer than the urban: 29.7% versus \n18.3% for overall poverty and 12.4% versus 6.7% in the case of extreme poverty. Poverty in Georgia is thus \npredominantly rural\u2014it makes 59% of the total poor and 62% of the extreme poor. The incidence of poverty varies \nconsiderably across Georgia. The highest incidence is observed in Shida Kartli (59.4%), followed by Kakheti (46.3%), \nand Mtskheta-Mtianeti (40.6%). The lowest incidence of poverty is found in Tbilisi (12.9%), Samegrelo (14.4%), and \nKvemo-Kartli (17.3%). Employment status is strongly correlated with poverty. Households headed by wage earners \nexperience the lowest rates of overall poverty (12.7%) and extreme poverty (4.4%). Among the employed, households \nheaded by the self-employed in agriculture face the highest poverty risk. In contrast, households headed by someone \nwho is unemployed or out of the labor force face a substantial risk of poverty. \nd  An alternative estimate of the poverty impact of the conflict was simulated using the 2007 living standard measurement \nsurvey data set and assuming that the purchasing power of the population clustered above the poverty lines would \ndecline by 5%, 10%, and 20%. If the purchasing power declines by 5%, the extreme poverty rate would rise to 10.4% \nand the overall poverty rate would increase to 26.3%. If the decline is 10%, these rates would increase to 11.8% of the \npopulation in the case of extreme poverty and 28.9% in the case of overall poverty. A 20% decline in the purchasing \npower would increase the overall poverty rate by 43% to 33.8%. Similarly, the extreme poverty rate would jump by 53%, \naffecting 14.3% of Georgia\u2019s population. \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20081113174101+08'00'", "Author": "DK3", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0 for Word", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0 (Windows)", "ModDate": "D:20081114104632+08'00'", "SourceModified": "D:20081113093851", "Title": "Emergency Assistance for Post-Conflict Recovery"}}
