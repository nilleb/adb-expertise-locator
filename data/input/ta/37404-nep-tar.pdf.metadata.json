His Majesty\u2019s Government of Nepal (the government) requested technical assistance \n(TA) to prepare a regional development strategy during the 2004 Country Programming Mission. \nAn advisory TA on Regional Development Strategy was included in the country program for \n20051, and a position paper was prepared in February 20052. A joint TA Fact-Finding Mission \n(the Mission) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the German Technical Cooperation \nAgency (GTZ), and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) was undertaken in \nNepal from 25 April to 2 May 2005. The Mission reached an understanding with the Government \nregarding the TA\u2019s objectives, scope, costs and financing, implementation arrangements, terms \nof reference for consultants, and counterpart support.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Although regional development has been a key policy objective since the 4th Five Year \nPlan (1970-75), spatial disparity between and within regions is still significant. For example, the \nHuman Development Index for the entire country is 0.46, with variations that range from 0.30 in \nthe  Mugu  district  to  more  than  twice  this  index  (0.65)  in  the  capital  city,  Kathmandu.3 \nSubsequent five-year plans and national development budgets continue to exhibit a strong \nsectoral bias, through strategies and with programs that are fragmented and unfocused. Five \nYear Plans and budgets did not incorporate explicit policies or programs to address acute \nspatial disparity, or to exploit comparative advantages at the regional or subregional levels. \nWhile the sectoral strategies provide a basis for regional planning, there is no clear basis for \ncoordination  among  central  government  agencies,  which  continue  to  implement  sectoral \nprograms without due consideration for the synergies that stem from integrated investment and \nprioritization within a region. \n \n3.  While the gradual implementation of decentralization policy will increase the role of local \nbodies, district development plans are often preoccupied with local issues within geographic \njurisdictions that are too small for effective coordination of strategic development. Moreover, \ndecisions  relating  to  the  priority  and  distribution  of  resources  between  regions  will  always \nremain a central prerogative. However, the capacity of central institutions to comprehensively \nconduct policy formulation, planning, programming and implementation for effective regional \ndevelopment requires strengthening. \n \n4.  Nepal is located between two fast growing economies. The economies of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC) to the north and India to the south are both expanding rapidly with high \ngrowth rates. A shift from purely sectoral to regional planning would allow Nepal's locational \nadvantage to be fully exploited in linking these fast growing economies. Growth potential for \ntransit related development needs to be assessed together with new trading opportunities that \nstem from improved access to international markets. Such activities can trigger development \nand need to be considered as key interventions within an overall policy for regional development, \nwithin Nepal and within the South Asia region in general. \n \n5.  Aware of the above, the Government has requested ADB's assistance to prepare a \nregional  development  strategy  to  provide:  (i)  a  comprehensive  spatial  development  policy \nframework within the forthcoming 11th Five Year Plan, (ii) an effective basis to coordinate \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 29 January 2005. \n2 Gurung, Harka. 2005. Nepal: Regional Strategy for Development. ADB: Manila (Study report for the Asian \nDevelopment Bank, February). \n3 United Nations Development Program. 2004. Human Development Report. Manila.  \n ", "2   \ninvestments in an integrated and sequenced manner for inclusion within the Medium Term \nExpenditure Framework, and (iii) a means to monitor and evaluate progress towards meeting \nregional priorities as well as the overall objective of reducing poverty while stimulating economic \ngrowth.  \n \n6.  Such a strategy has to recognize and address a number of challenges: (i) the successful \nimplementation  of  the  regional  development  strategy  will  hinge  on  resource  mobilization. \nAccordingly, substantial external assistance will be required, reflecting large development needs \nin relation to limited scope to rapidly expand the domestic tax base; (ii) regional disparity \nespecially when aligned with political, social, and ethnic tensions, often leads to or exacerbates \nconflict. Accordingly due attention should be given to plans and programs for investments that \nwill be implemented in the conflict environment and assist to address root causes of the conflict; \nand (iii) the active participation and ownership of all stakeholders, including representatives of \nthe political parties, is essential for success in the absence of central and local level politicians. \n \n7.  The TA concept is fully consistent with the operational priorities of the new Country \nStrategy and Program (CSP) for Nepal, approved in October 2004. The CSP recognizes that \npriority setting has been poor with respect to addressing regional imbalances in social and \neconomic development. As a result there is no spatial focus for public investment in the Five \nYear  Plans  and  national  budgets.  Accordingly,  the  CSP  identifies  assistance  for  regional \ndevelopment, particularly in the areas of strategy formulation, institutional capacity for planning \nand implementation, and priority setting of public investment for regional development, as a key \noperational priority. Strengthening these areas will support the broad economic growth thrust of \nthe CSP and greatly contribute to the successful implementation of its overall objectives. \n \n8.  Major  development  partners  supported  the  concept  of  the  TA.  GTZ  and  JICA \nparticipated in the Mission. GTZ and JICA agreed to work together with the Bank to assist the \nGovernment in implementing the TA and to review the possibility of sending experts in areas \ncomplementing the TA activities based on their own mission findings. Further consultations with \nother development partners will be undertaken in the course of finalization of the TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The impact of the TA is a regional development strategy that will sustainably reduce \nregional  disparities  in  living  standards,  while  utilizing  spatial  development  potentials  more \neffectively. The outcome will be clearly prioritized development plans and programs based on \nthe regional development strategy prepared by the TA and the establishment of an improved \npolicy and implementation mechanism for achieving regional development objectives. It will also \nhelp address inequalities that are a root cause of the present conflict.  \n \n10.  The TA will take a two-pronged approach. The first prong will assist to reduce poverty, \nwhich is most acute in the remote rural areas. The second prong recognizes that certain \nlocations in Nepal have better economic potential than others, and accordingly, investments in \nthese will stimulate national development and provide benefits to less advantaged hinterlands. \nBoth prongs should explore opportunities to work in partnership with the private sector and civil \nsociety  to  prepare  and  implement  plans.  The  TA  design  and  monitoring  framework  is  in \nAppendix 2. \n \n ", "  3\n11.  The TA will assist the Government to prepare a medium to long term (5 to 10 years) \nregional development strategy, supported by integrated multisector investment programs that \nidentify  key  projects  to  trigger  new  or  additional  economic  activity  in  accordance  with \ndevelopment potential. The strategy will assist NPC to prepare the 11th Five Year Plan by \nproviding specific spatial guidance (regional development concepts) that help to determine \nregional resource allocation. The multisector investment programs will provide a rationale for \nprioritization  of  projects  for  inclusion  in  the  national  budget  through  the  Medium  Term \nExpenditure Framework. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA has four components. \n \n13.  Component 1, following reviews of regional disparities, economic opportunities, and \ncommitted programs/projects, will define economic regions4 and for each will prepare a regional \ndevelopment concept, to maximize its potentials through a medium term multi-sector investment \nprogram  that  includes  initial  key  investments  to  kick  start  development.  The  regional \ndevelopment  strategy  will  be  prepared  based  on  the  regional  development  concepts, \nconsidering the synergies from integrated investment across regions and boarders. \n \n14.  Component 2 will review previous regional policy and the institutional, financial, legal, \nand administrative context. Drawing from lessons learned, and the output of component 1, \nrecommendations will be made for new policy initiatives and appropriate reforms with particular \nattention to achieving regional development objectives as part of national budget preparation. \n \n15.  Component 3 will ensure stakeholder's active participation in analyses and formulation of \ncomponents 1 and 2 recommendations by organizing workshops, seminars, meetings, and \nconsultations, as well as conferences to disseminate lessons learned from best practices. In \naddition, the NPC website will be utilized to propagate information concerning the project and to \nelicit  comments  and  contributions  from  interested  parties.  The  TA  will  liaise  closely  with \ndonors/agencies active in the development of Nepal in order to achieve a unified approach to \nregional development. \n \n16.  Component 4 will train staff concerned on the methodology of component 1. Manuals will \nbe prepared to assist staff to monitor/evaluate implementation of the regional development \nstrategy, and to make adjustments as necessary. Senior officials/representatives will be invited \nto join an exposure visit to selected countries to observe and learn about the operations and \nbenefits of strategies for regional development. \n \n17.  For the preparation of component 1, the TA will take into account available human and \nfinancial resources, being important constraints to the number and nature of key investments, \ntheir  timing  and  cost.  The  TA  will  prepare  indicative  costs  and  financing  options  for  key \ninvestments  with  due  regard  to  the  merits  of  stimulating  private-public  partnerships  while \nfocusing on priority sectors, in particular, transport, energy, water, agriculture, and forestry.  \nExternal assistance for key investments will be a critical factor and hence the TA will liaise \nclosely with agencies active in the development of Nepal. The regional strategy will serve as an \neffective basis to coordinate investments within the Medium Term Expenditure Framework.  \n \n18.  Component 2 will assist the Government to identify appropriate reforms that will rectify \ninherent  administrative  problems  as  well  as  facilitate  implementation  of  the  regional \n                                                 \n4 Economic regions are for planning purposes and may not be coterminous with administrative regions. \n ", "4   \ndevelopment  strategy  in  a  demand  responsive  manner,  and  within  the  spirit  of  effective \ndecentralization.  However,  the  ability  of  the  local  bodies  to  carry  out  regional  planning  is \nconstrained by limited functional responsibility and weak institutional capacity. In recognition of \nthese constraints, this component will focus on improving and refining existing procedures, most \nof which are centralized at the National Planning Commission (NPC) and the line ministries. \nHowever, the TA will explore ways and means to involve local bodies through consultative \nprocedures with their associations.5 Component 2 should tackle reform on an incremental basis \non the understanding that the strategies and programs can be started as soon as possible \nunder the present arrangements. \n \n19.  Component 3 is critical to generate a sense of ownership among all stakeholders for the \noutput of the TA. The absence of elected representatives does pose a risk that the TA becomes \na bureaucratic exercise without adequate consultation among the people. To avoid this, it will be \nnecessary to consult with elected representatives whose tenure has expired. For this, the active \nparticipation of the associations that represent local bodies will be sought. Consultations with \nother stakeholders at central and regional levels will also be conducted. Particular attention \nshould be given to the private sector, and to marginal groups and the poor, whose voice is \nseldom heard in matters of regional development. Outcomes will be disseminated to all sections \nof society through workshops, publications and websites. Innovative suggestions and ideas from \nany stakeholder will be welcome. \n \n20.  Component  4  is  essential  if  the  process  of  regional  planning  is  to  be  sustainable. \nHowever, at present regional planning is not carried out in the sense intended by the TA. The \nonly institution that conducts this kind of analysis is NPC. Other ministries do not have this \nfunction within their mandate, beyond their own sectoral interests. Appropriate target groups will \ntherefore depend on the outcome of component 3. Nevertheless, it is envisaged that training \nprograms will be tailored to build core competency and to introduce and sustain improved or \nnew procedures to be conducted by the National Planning Commission and the line ministries. \nOrientation programs will also be provided to local bodies (through their associations) as well as \nother stakeholders, including organizations representing the private sector and civil society. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The TA is estimated to cost $920,000 equivalent, of which the foreign exchange cost is \n$406,000 and the local currency cost is $514,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $760,000 on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program to cover the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$354,000 equivalent of the local currency costs. Main components to be funded by ADB are the \nforeign and domestic consultants, equipment, workshops and seminars, and administration \nsupport costs. The Government will contribute the remaining local currency cost of $160,000 \nequivalent to provide office accommodation, counterpart staff support, facilities for seminars and \nmeetings, and other administrative expenses. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2. \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The National Planning Commission will be the executing and implementing agency. A \nsteering committee, chaired by the NPC Vice Chairman, and comprising representatives from \nrelevant ministries, local governments, private sector, civil society, and experts, will provide \nstrategic leadership and coordination for the preparation of the regional development strategy \n                                                 \n5 The Association of District Development Committees of Nepal (ADDCN), the Municipal Association of Nepal \n(MuAN), and the National Association of Village Development Committees in Nepal (NAVIN). \n ", "  5\nand investment plans. The committee will assign working groups to study and report on priority \nareas as required and will integrate working group reports into a cohesive plan. A permanent \nregional planning unit will be established within the NPC, headed by a NPC member. It will work \nin close collaboration with the TA team on the understanding that it will continue thereafter the \nprocesses/procedures identified and established during the course of the TA. The unit will liaise \nwith relevant government agencies and provide counterpart technical staff to the TA consultants \nas necessary. The steering committee and working groups will liaise closely with the high level \ntask force which was established to prepare a strategy for the development of transit facilities in \nNepal to facilitate People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC)-India trade. Appendix 3 sets out the \nimplementation arrangements. \n \n23.  The TA will be implemented over 12 calendar months, beginning around February 2006 \nto ending in March 2007. Tripartite meetings of the Government, TA consultants, and ADB will \nbe chaired by the NPC vice chairman, and held every 4 months to review TA implementation \npriorities, address issues arising during TA implementation, and provide guidance to the TA \nconsultants. The steering committee will meet at the beginning of the project and then every two \nmonths to guide the TA and resolve policy and implementation issues. The steering committee \nand working groups will regularly invite representatives of civil society and other stakeholders to \ncontribute to the TA. Stakeholder consultation seminars and meetings will be held to discuss the \nTA\u2019s progress and obtain their inputs on the TA findings. \n  \n24.  The TA will provide 81 person-months of consulting services (11 person-months of \ninternational consulting services in the fields of regional development, macroeconomics, and \ninfrastructure planning and 70 person-months of domestic consulting services). The domestic \nconsultants will be selected to cover sectoral and cross-cutting issues in the fields of regional \nplanning, macroeconomics, public finance institutions, infrastructure planning and engineering, \ntransportation,  trade,  tourism,  agriculture,  natural  resources,  environment  and \nparticipatory/social  development,  and  further  consulting  input  needs  identified  as  plan \npreparation proceeds. Consultants will be recruited by the Bank through a firm using a simplified \ntechnical proposal, in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants, and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. \nInternational  and  local  consultancy  firms  will  be  required  to  form  an  association  for  the \nsubmission of bids and for the execution of the TA. Outline terms of reference for consultants \nare in Appendix 4. \n \n25.  To reinforce the Government\u2019s ownership, TA contributions to the regional development \nstrategy will be in the form of NPC outputs. However, the consultants will prepare monthly \nprogress reports summarizing TA activities and institutional and technical issues. In addition, 4 \nreports will be submitted to the steering committee and ADB. The consultants will prepare (i) an \ninception report including a detailed TA work program to be submitted no later than one month \nafter fielding of TA consultants; (ii) a midterm report 6 months after TA commencement; (iii) a \ndraft final report to the Government to be submitted 2 month before TA completion; and (iv) a \nfinal report submitted within 3 weeks after receiving comments on the draft final report. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n26.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $760,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for Regional Development Strategy and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact       \n\u2022  Improved prosperity  \u2022 Overall increase in  \u2022 Measures or indices of   \nof regional (and the  the human  Human Development, \nnational) economies.  development indices  as published in various \n\u2022  Inequality, as a root  of regions and a  reports, such as the \ncause of the present  reduction in regional  Nepal Human \nconflict, is  disparities.
