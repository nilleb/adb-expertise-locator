INTRODUCTION \n1.  Following a request from the Government of Nepal in 2006 for a capacity development \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  grant  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  develop  an \nenvironmental master plan, ADB included a TA in its country operations business plan for \n2008.1 Based on consultations during reconnaissance missions in March and May 2008, the \ntitle and focus of the TA was changed to Strengthening Capacity for Managing Climate Change \nand the Environment. A TA Fact-Finding Mission was fielded from 27 July to 3 August 2008 and \nincluded  a  3-day  multi-stakeholder  workshop  to  prepare  the  TA  project  design.  Thirty-two \nparticipants representing the Ministry of Environment, Science and Technology (MOEST), other \ngovernment line agencies and apex bodies, associations of district and village development \ncommittees, nongovernment organizations, academia, and donors attended. A wrap-up meeting, \nwhich was chaired by the secretary of the Ministry of Finance, was held on 3 August 2008. ADB \nagreed with the Government on the purpose, outputs, methodology, key activities, costs and \nfinancing plan, implementation arrangements, and scope of counterpart support. The TA design \nand monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Located in a geologically-young and unstable, rugged terrain in the Himalayas, Nepal\u2019s \nnatural  environment  and  ecosystems  are  diverse  and  vulnerable.  These  ecosystems  are \nincreasingly threatened by a rapidly-growing population that is putting pressure on the country\u2019s \nfragile natural resource base, which includes land, water, and forest resources. With resource-\ndependent human settlements relying heavily on these ecosystems for their livelihood, the \ndeterioration of the environmental and natural resource base has contributed to chronic rural \npoverty and migration to urban areas and other countries. According to the Stocktaking Report \non Climate Change prepared under the National Capacity Needs Self-Assessment process,2 \nrecords of average national temperatures show high inter-annual variability, and maximum \ntemperatures in Nepal are progressively increasing in line with global and regional records. \nPrecipitation extremes show an increasing trend of intense precipitation, indicating that more \nweather-related disasters, such as floods and landslides, can be expected in future.  \n3.  Ongoing climate variability and change are projected to impact different sectors in Nepal. \nThe expected impact on water resources includes water shortages in dry seasons, while rising \ntemperatures will cause faster melt and retreat among Nepal\u2019s 3,252 glaciers, with an attendant \nincrease in sudden flooding following glacial lake outbursts. Increases in seasonal temperatures \nare likely to affect agricultural production and yield. Rising temperatures, glacial retreat, and \nchanges in water availability and quality will also lead to changes in natural biodiversity affecting \nNepal\u2019s high number of unique wild animals and plant species. Global warming is anticipated to \naffect forest ecosystems through the migration of forests towards the polar region, changes in \ncomposition, and extinction of species.  Climate change will also have a direct impact on wildlife, \nwith the species most at risk being those with low dispersal capacity (e.g., soil fauna, non-flying \ninsects). The growing risk of malaria and encephalitis are identified as potential impacts of \nclimate  change  on  human  health.  Communities  are  likely  to  suffer  increased  loss  of \ninfrastructure and shelter from flooding events, decreased productivity from more incidents of \nmalnutrition and disease, social disruption and displacement from extreme events (e.g., floods, \ndroughts, and  disease outbreaks), and losses to earning capacity.        \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Nepal: Country Operations and Program (2008\u20132010). Manila. The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 28 August 2008. \n2  Thematic Working Group on Climate Change. 2008. Stocktaking Report on Climate Change. Kathmandu. \n ", "2   \n4.  Stakeholders at both the national and local levels in Nepal are insufficiently informed \nabout climate change, and the public\u2019s environmental awareness in general is low. Nepal has \nno environmental information center, and important policy documents and information materials \nare unavailable in the local language. As a result, citizens do not adequately participate in \nenvironmental  protection,  and  an  environmental  monitoring  system  does  not  yet  exist.  In \naddition, the country is unable to present a strong negotiating position at international fora, \nincluding the Conference of Parties, and meetings of the subsidiary bodies of the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).   \n5.  Efforts have been made to integrate environmental concerns into national development \nplans and programs since the 1980s. These include: (i) establishment of a ministry in the early \n1990s, (ii) introduction of environmental impact assessments (EIAs), (iii) promulgating the Nepal \nEnvironmental Policy and Action Plan, (iv) enactment of the Environmental Protection Act and \nRules  in  1997,  and  (v)  development  of  standards  to  minimize  the  adverse  impacts  of \ndevelopment  projects.  Nevertheless,  climate  change  and  environmental  issues  are  given \ninadequate priority in the national development agenda, and environmental governance is weak. \nEvaluations conducted under the National Capacity Needs Self-Assessment process (2008) \nconfirm that the nature and gravity of climate change risks are not fully appreciated, there is \ninadequate  public  pressure  for  change,  and  more  pressing  national  agendas  overshadow \neffective environmental protection and climate change risk management. Local governments \nare not provided the opportunity to participate in climate change risk management and decision \nmaking.  A  key  deficiency  is  the  absence  of  any  legal  protection  for  environmental  rights. \nEnvironmental management agencies and organizations lack accountability due to ineffective \nmonitoring mechanisms, inadequate input from local governments, and the lack of a citizens\u2019 \ncomplaint mechanism regarding environmental degradation. \n6.  There is poor coordination among  stakeholders responsible for climate change risk \nmanagement and environmental protection. While environment and climate change affect all \nsectors, Nepal does not have crosscutting policies in place to govern them. There are no \ncoordination mechanisms with clearly defined procedures to promote effective collaboration \nbetween the central and local governments, and among sectoral agencies, communities, and \nthe  private  sector.  The  high  turnover  of  environmental  professionals  creates  a  lack  of \ninstitutional memory  and  there  is no  system  of  knowledge  transfer  within  organizations or \namong organizations. Local governments do not have the capacity to collaborate with the \ncentral government effectively. \n7.  Neither MOEST nor the other sector agencies are staffed to monitor and enforce current \nrules  and  regulations.  Most  government  agencies  lack  adequate  resources  to  effectively \naddress climate change risk and environmental protection. There are multiple agencies and \ninstitutions at the central level that have a role in environmental management, but there is no \nsingle  authority  to  ensure  implementation  and  enforcement  of  environmental  rules  and \nregulations. MOEST focuses on setting standards and does not have an entity or line agency to \nenforce environmental rules and regulations, implement policy, coordinate among the various \nsectors, develop public awareness, and collaborate with other line ministries and stakeholders \nat all levels. Part of the systemic problem is the lack of an environmental professional group or \ntrack within the civil service system. \n \n ", "  3\n8.  ADB  provided  two  TAs  to  Nepal  in  the  1990s  for  institutional  development  on \nenvironment, both of which were rated satisfactory.3 A number of initiatives are currently being \nundertaken to address climate change risks affecting Nepal.4 Two such initiatives are directly \nrelated to the TA. The National Adaptation Programme of Action to Climate Change (NAPA) \nproject5 will develop and establish a climate change research, knowledge management, and \nlearning platform to address priority climate change research needs, and strengthen capacity on \nclimate  change  research  and  knowledge  and  adaptation  planning.  The  United  Nations \nDevelopment  Programme/United  Nations  Environment  Programme  Poverty  Environment \nInitiative will focus on comprehensively integrating environmental considerations into national \npolicies  and  programs,  and  encourage  policy  makers  to  implement  environmentally-sound \nstrategies in selected sectors. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will complement other climate change initiatives, in particular the NAPA project. \nThe impact of the TA will be strengthened country capacity for environment and climate change \nmanagement.  The  expected  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  an  agreement  on  an  improved, \nsustainable institutional framework for managing environment protection and climate change. \nThe TA will assist MOEST and other line agencies responsible for environmental management \nto raise awareness, build new and strengthen existing capacities and skills, and mainstream \nenvironmental and climate change considerations into the national development agenda. The \ncapacity of regional, district, and local governments also need to be enhanced to support the \nGovernment\u2019s decentralization policies, and to enable them to effectively collaborate with the \ncentral  government.  The  public  will  also  be  targeted  in  an  effort  to  increase  Government \naccountability for a clean and healthy environment. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The outcome will be achieved through three outputs: (i) agreement on the appropriate \norganizational framework; (ii) agreement on a funding mechanism to support the organizational \nframework; and (iii) implementation of an effective public education, information, and awareness \nprogram on environmental protection and climate change. The TA will facilitate a consensus-\nbuilding process to determine the best approach for enforcing environmental protection and \ndecreasing climate change risk at all levels (national, regional, district, and community).  \n1.  Organizational Framework \n11.  The  first  TA  output  will  be  to  generate  agreement  for  an  effective  organizational \nframework. While MOEST oversees environmental rules and regulations, and serves as the \nfocal point for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and apex bodies (such as the National \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 1994. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Strengthening Interministerial Capabilities for \nImplementing Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines. Manila (1995\u20131996, TA 2244-NEP, approved on 15 \nDecember) assisted in enhancing the in-house capabilities of key development ministries to implement the EIA \nguidelines, strengthening inter-ministerial coordination, and preparing draft environment assessment guidelines for \nselected sectors while ADB. 1997. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Nepal for Institutional Strengthening of \nthe  Ministry  of  Population  and  Environment.  Manila  (1997\u20131998,  TA  2847-NEP,  approved  on  22  August) \nstrengthened the institutional capacity of a newly formed Ministry of Population and Environment to carry out its \nmandate for environmental protection. \n4  Current  climate  change  initiatives  are  summarized  in  Nepal:  Climate  Change  Implementation  Plan.  ADB \n(forthcoming). \n5  A $1,325,000 project funded by the Global Environment Facility, Department for International Development of the \nUnited Kingdom, and United Nations Development Programme to (i) prepare the NAPA, (ii) develop a climate \nchange knowledge management and learning platform, and (iii) develop a multi-stakeholder framework of action for \nclimate change. \n ", "4   \nPlanning Commission) help coordinate among Government ministries, stakeholders are calling \nfor a dedicated institution with the authority to coordinate and enforce environmental and climate \nchange laws and policies at the central and subnational levels. A range of institutional options \nwill  be  explored,  including  expanding  MOEST\u2019s  current  mandate,  reconstituting  the \nEnvironmental Protection Council, and creating a new agency. The TA will support analysis and \nconsensus-building  on  an  institutional  framework, 6   and  prepare  an  implementation  plan \n(business,  legal,  financial,  human  resources,  and  operations)  for  the  new  organizational \nstructure. The laws and policies needed to put the institution into place will also be drafted. The \nGovernment  will  engage  in  a  national  participatory  consultation  process  to  formulate  for \nrecommendations for an appropriate organizational framework.  \n12.  Once the organizational structure at the central level has been agreed upon, the TA will \ndevelop an action plan for mainstreaming environmental protection and climate change into \nsubnational  administration  by  drawing  lessons  from  successful  initiatives,  including  the \ncommunity forestry management program under the Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation. \nThe action plan will clarify jurisdictional responsibilities at all levels of government (central, \nregional or provincial, district, and village and/or municipality). Financing for a related activity for \nstrengthening  capacity  among  community-level  stakeholders  through  climate  change \nvulnerability assessments, vulnerability mapping, and adaptation planning will be sought from \nother ADB sources.7\n13.  The strengthened organization will need to be staffed by environmental professionals. A \ncivil service career path for environmental technicians and professionals will be created. In order \nto enhance the capacity of the Government to more effectively negotiate in international climate \nchange fora, the TA will fund increased participation of government officials in key UNFCCC \ninternational meetings. \n2.  Funding Mechanism \n14.  The  Government  will  agree  on  an  appropriate  financing  mechanism  to  support  the \ndedicated institution and sustain its existence, and enable district and local governments to \nprotect their immediate environments and reduce risks associated with climate change. The TA \nwill fund the review of international and national best practices and financing mechanisms, \nincluding the Environment Protection Fund administered by MOEST, in accordance with the \nEnvironment Protection Act and Rules. MOEST will facilitate a consultation and consensus-\nbuilding process to discuss recommendations and agree upon options. The legal framework for \nestablishing the financing mechanism will be prepared for the Government\u2019s approval.  \n3.  Information, Education, and Awareness \n15.  An education, information, and awareness strategy will be developed and implemented \nin order to increase understanding of climate change and environmental issues, and support for \npublic spending for the environment. Within 6 months of TA commencement, the Government \nwill agree upon a strategy and work plan for increasing the cadre of environmental professionals \nthrough  education  and  awareness-raising  activities.  Nepal-based  training  institutes  and \ncommunications organizations will be employed to implement activities targeting the central \ngovernment  and  politicians;  regional,  district,  and  local  government  bodies;  media;  and \ncommunities and the general public. Environmental professionals will also be targeted through \nstrengthening  environmental  education  within  the  Government\u2019s  existing  professional \ndevelopment program, and providing recommendations for updating formal educational curricula. \n                                                 \n6  Existing institutions at the national and subnational levels will be assessed, including those responsible for disaster \nrisk management. \n7  Funding sources under consideration include the ADB-administered Climate Change Fund (May 2008). \n ", "  5\nTraining-of-trainers programs will be conducted at all levels of government and environmental \nprofessionals. Mass communications and public awareness programs will also be launched \nunder the TA. \n16.  The key risks that could affect the successful achievement of TA objectives relate to the \npresent  political  uncertainty  in  Nepal  that  could  undermine  the  necessary  political  will  to \nimplement  the  reforms  needed  to  strengthen  the  current  environmental  organization  and \nimplement necessary legal, policy, and institutional capacity-building measures. There must \nalso be a strong commitment among national and subnational government stakeholders to \nparticipate  in  the  consultation  process,  review  inputs,  and  determine  the  best  institutional \nframework for advancing environmental issues on the national development agenda. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $620,000 equivalent. ADB will provide $500,000, \nfinanced  on  a  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  ADB  will  finance  national  and \ninternational  consulting  services,  production  of  reports,  equipment,  workshops,  studies, \nGovernment staff participation in UNFCCC meetings, training programs, and administrative \nsupport services. Government support to the TA, estimated at $120,000 equivalent, will be in-\nkind, and will include the provision of counterpart staff, office accommodation and space for \nmeetings, and general office support. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  MOEST will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will be responsible for project \nmanagement and overall coordination with ADB. A project steering committee\u2014chaired by \nSecretary,  MOEST\u2014will  comprise  representatives  from  concerned  ministries  and  local \ngovernment, including Ministry of Local Development, National Planning Commission, Ministry \nof Forests and Soil Conservation, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of General Administration, local \ngovernment associations, and other entities as relevant. The steering committee will oversee TA \nimplementation and ensure coordination among all stakeholders, and with related environment \nand climate change programs, including the NAPA project. Environmental professionals from \nMOEST  and  other  government  ministries  and  line  agencies  will  lead  working  groups. \nGovernment  staff  may  be  retained  as  resource  persons  to  make  presentations during  the \nconsultation process and to peer review consultant reports. \n19.  A  joint  secretary  from  MOEST  will  be  assigned  to  serve  as  project  director.  An \nundersecretary from MOEST will serve as project manager to oversee the day-to-day work of \nthe consultant team and coordinate among all levels of government and the broader stakeholder \ngroup of nongovernment organizations, academe, and environmental professionals. The project \ndirector and project manager will coordinate with other climate change initiatives implemented \nby MOEST to ensure efficiency and harmonization among projects. MOEST will form working \ngroups among government stakeholders and manage a process of consensus-building using \nthe inputs provided by a consultant facilitator/change management specialist and technical \nconsultants to ensure agreement on project outputs (e.g., dedicated environment institution, \nfunding mechanism, proposed legislation, and action plan for subnational administration) by the \nend of the implementation period. MOEST will provide full administrative and technical support \nto the project management team. \n20.  Consulting services for the TA will total 42 person-months,: 3 person-months for an \ninternational legal/policy/institutional specialist and 39 person-months for national consultants. \nThe  expertise  required  from  national  consultants  includes:  project  facilitator/change \n ", "6   \nmanagement  specialist  (18  person-months),  training  specialist  (9  person-months),  policy \nspecialist  (6  person-months),  and  financial  management  specialist  (6  person-months).  The \nsummary terms of reference are in Appendix 3. However, the specific terms of reference may \nbe refined following TA inception.8 The project facilitator will assist the project manager in all TA \nactivities. All consultants will be recruited on an individual basis, in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time), in consultation with \nthe project steering committee. Equipment for the TA\u2019s activities will be financed by ADB in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will \nbecome property of the Government upon completion of the TA. \n21.  National training and communications service providers, and media organizations will \ndesign and deliver training and awareness-raising programs for targeted stakeholder groups, \nincluding central government officials, district and local government officials, media, and the \ngeneral public. ADB will engage such institutes through single-source selection and the training \nand communications specialist will oversee their activities.  \n22.  Consensus-building on TA outputs will take time. Therefore, the TA will be implemented \nover 3 years, with expected commencement in January 2009 and completion in December 2011. \nThe reporting requirements for the TA will include (i) an inception report within 3 weeks of TA \ncommencement, (ii) project reporting outputs in accordance with the TA\u2019s design and monitoring \nframework, (iii) a final report summarizing the achievements of the TA, and (iv) a brief bimonthly \nprogress reports when other reports are not due. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Nepal for Strengthening Capacity for Managing Climate Change and the \nEnvironment, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n8  MOEST and ADB will coordinate TA implementation with the NAPA project and Poverty Environment Initiative, and \nmay need to adjust the consultants\u2019 scopes of work to ensure coordination and efficiency.  \n ", "     \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nDesign  Performance Targets and/or  Data Sources and/or Reporting  Assumptions  \nSummary  Indicators  Mechanisms   and Risks  \nImpact      Assumption \nStrengthened country  Dedicated Government institution is  Government gazette, budget, and  \u2022  Trained staff are retained in \ncapacity for managing  fully staffed and funded by 2015  public service commission records  government service for at least 5 \nenvironment and climate      years \nchange  50% of local government units     \n  implement action plan by 2015  Records of associations of district   \n  and village development \n  committees \n10\u201320 qualified environmental   \nprofessionals are working in  Public service commission records \ngovernment service by 2015 \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nImproved, sustainable  Two-thirds of parliamentarians are  Minutes of parliamentary discussion  \u2022  There is political commitment to \ninstitutional framework for  generally supportive of establishing    strengthen the current institutional \nmanaging  climate change  a dedicated institution for managing    framework for environment and \nand the environment is  climate change and the    climate change \nagreed upon by Government  environment     \u2022  Policy recommendations are \n      supported \n80% of sample set of district  District development budgets for   \ngovernments commit resources for  fiscal year 2012  Risks \nimplementing action plan    \u2022  Budget allocation is insufficient \n    \u2022  Activities conducted under the project \nAnnual operational budget for  Government fiscal year 2012  will not be sustained \ndedicated institution is funded 80%  environment budget allocation  \nby Government resources   \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
