The Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) of ASEAN+31\u2014endorsed at the ASEAN+3 \nFinance Ministers Meeting in August 2003 to accelerate the development of efficient and liquid \nbond markets in the region\u2014established the ABMI Working Group (WG) 2 on Credit Guarantee \nand Investment Mechanism (CGIM). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has supported the \nABMI WG2 by providing technical assistance (TA)2 to help WG2 understand the potential \ndemand and the best practices in ASEAN+3 for bond guarantee facilities, loans, and equity \ninvestment  that  facilitate  and  support  the  development  of  local  currency  bond  markets. \nConsidering the recommendations of the phase 1 TA, ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers endorsed a \nproposal in May 2006 to launch a phase 2 study that will examine in depth (i) the business \nvolumes for various business lines, (ii) the feasibility of each of three preferred organizational \noptions for establishing a CGIM. The study will include a cost/benefit analysis and address \ninstitutional issues related to establishing a CGIM. \n \n2.  By setting the stage for establishing the CGIM, the phase 2 TA3 continues ADB support \nto ABMI WG2 in promoting policy dialogue for the development of efficient and liquid bond \nmarkets in the region. The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Information  asymmetries  prevent  effective  and  efficient  interaction  among  market \nparticipants,  especially  in  matching  bond  issuers  with  investors.  Currently,  private \ncorporations\u2014especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)\u2014rarely use bond markets \nfor their financing requirements. Issuing corporate bonds with an investment grade credit rating \n(BBB and above) that appeal to potential investors is currently a laborious process, due in part \nto often complex procedures and approval processes that lack transparency. This informational \ngap between an issuer\u2019s credit quality and the minimum credit requirements of investors is one \nof the most significant impediments to the development of liquid bond markets, both domestic \nand regional. Nurturing or enhancing the credit quality of bond issuers will enable qualified \nprivate sector enterprises to participate in and benefit from regional bond market development.  \n \n4.  The primary role of the CGIM is to provide local currency bond guarantees, which should \naid in removing credit quality information asymmetries and help bridge the gap between issuers \nand investors. Bond market participants are hesitant to actively use markets that lack  efficient \nbond market infrastructure, such as (i) an easily negotiable regulatory framework allowing bond \nmarket access by both foreign and domestic investors and issuers; (ii) transparent and reliable \nfinancial accounting and reporting systems; (iii) effective and objective credit rating agencies, \nincluding information dissemination by credit reference bureaus; and (iv) specialized financial \nmarket educational institutions. A high-quality guarantee facility is one suggested solution to \nnarrow the credit quality gap in securitization transactions, as it enables borrowers to issue \nasset-backed securities at credit ratings higher than what they could obtain on their own. Bond \nguarantees can be an intermediate measure that will bridge the perceived gap, in addition to \n                                                 \n1  ASEAN+3  includes  the  10  members  of  ASEAN  (Brunei  Darussalam,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam), People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, Japan, and Republic of Korea.  \n2 ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for ASEAN+3 Regional Guarantee Mechanism. Manila (TA 6127-REG for \n$935,000, approved on 27 October). The TA was cofinanced by the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and the \nRepublic of Korea, and completed in 2005.    \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 21 September 2006.  \n ", "2   \nproviding credit enhancement. Guarantees encourage cross-border investment in the region as \nwell as investment from investors outside the region.  \n \n5.  In addition to local currency bond guarantees, the phase 1 TA also identified additional \nbusiness  lines  for  the  CGIM,  for  example  to  provide  loans  and  loan  guarantees,  equity \ninvestments, and TAs to fund the building of capacity in the expertise required to build an \neffective and efficient bond market infrastructure, particularly in economies where local currency \nbond markets are at an early stage of development. Loans and loan guarantees can facilitate \nthe longer-term development of bond markets, for example, by providing loans to financial \nintermediaries for funding SMEs and infrastructure projects, or bridging loans to be refinanced \nby  bond  issuance  or  securitization.  Equity  investments  can  be  made  for  bond  market \ninfrastructure (such as credit rating or clearing and settlement agencies) and in companies or \nprojects linked to longer-term local currency bond market development. Compared with existing \nprivate market guarantors and bilateral agencies, the CGIM is planned to have a focused, \nsystematic long-term approach, a high credit rating, thus implying lower costs and better risk \ndiversification from economies of scale. The CGIM would not compete with existing market \nparticipants, but would operate under the principles of adding value and partnering with existing \nstakeholders.   \n \n6.  Beyond the three business lines and TA fund of the CGIM, there were other major \nassumptions underlying the phase 1 study. These included the following: \n \n(i)  Business  focus.  Provision  of  facilities  to  the  private  sector  to  develop  local \ncurrency bond markets in the ASEAN+3 region. \n(ii)  Countries  of  operation.  Principally  ASEAN+3,  but  with  business  lines  being \nunderwritten  in  non-ASEAN+3  economies  where  it  is  considered  desirable  to \nmanage and diversify risk. \n(iii)  Credit rating of the CGIM. International AAA. \n(iv)  Investment guidelines. Guidelines would include term of exposures or facilities, \nunderwriting philosophy, each business asset leverage to the total capital, single risk \nlimits, maximum equity investments, country exposure limits, sector concentrations, \nrecycling of capital/ equity investments, and pricing. \n \n7.  The  phase  1  study  also  developed  a  business  demand  estimate.4  The  estimate \nconcluded that there is sufficient business volume with the requisite quality to support the CGIM. \nThe estimates for bond guarantees, loans, loan guarantees, and equity investments for the \ninitial 10 years of the CGIM\u2019s operation would total $17 billion, with the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina (PRC) accounting for $10 billion; Indonesia $2 billion; Malaysia $1.5 billion; Philippines \n$0.5 billion; and Thailand $2 billion. Amounts reserved for less developed markets such as \nCambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, and Viet Nam total $1 billion.  \n \n8.  Based on the above assumptions, the financial model calculations5 done in the phase 1 \nstudy show the CGIM would require a capital amount of $3.5 billion, with an initial paid-up \n                                                 \n4  The methodologies used to estimate  business demand are (i) macroeconomic demand studies; (ii) country surveys \ncirculated to all member countries and the appointment of national consultants in five focus countries (PRC, \nIndonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand); (iii) market consultations and field investigations; (iv) case studies, \nand (v) the development of supply-based business demand estimates, and integration with the financial model. \n5 The financial model generates a financial projection for the CGIM\u2019s business plan based on the requirements for a \ncredit rating from international rating agencies through an MDI (Multilateral Development Institution)\u2014including \ngenerally accepted accounting principles, financial statements, and key financial ratios covering capital adequacy, \nprofitability, efficiency, operating performance, and other measures. \n ", "  3\ncapital of $2 billion and an additional $1.5 billion contractually committed but paid in installments. \nThe phase 1 study also concluded that overall personnel requirements would rise from 42 at \nstart-up to 123 by the end of the third year. The CGIM\u2019s success will largely depend on how it is \nestablished,  how  it  maintains  strongly  focused  underwriting  skills,  whether  it  has  a  strong \nmanagement team with proven private sector skills, and if it can mobilize experienced senior \nunderwriting personnel on the ground in key markets. \n \n9.  At the ABMI WG2 meeting in March 2006, WG2 members discussed the draft final \nreport of the phase 1 study, principally endorsing its conclusions. The WG2 co-chairs (the PRC \nand Republic of Korea) decided to narrow the institutional options for the CGIM  to three: (i) a \nnew independent multilateral development institution (MDI) structured on a stand-alone basis \n(option one).6 (ii) an MDI structured as a subsidiary or affiliate of ADB (option two),7 and \n(iii) expand the existing ADB role in an official capacity (option three)8 (the phase 1 study \nproposed two other organizational options9). In May 2006, the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers \n(meeting on the sidelines of the ADB annual general meeting in Hyderabad, India) endorsed a \nphase 2 study that would examine in depth (i) an appropriate business model for the CGIM, and \n(ii) the feasibility of each of the three preferred organizational options.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The TA aims to conduct an in-depth study to help identify which organizational option is \nbest for establishing the CGIM. The study will assess the feasibility of each of the three options \nin para. 9. The TA will also prepare a draft business model and plan for the CGIM as a proposal \nto ABMI member countries. The TA will support the policy dialogue of ABMI WG2 in promoting \nregional cooperation for developing deep and mature local currency bond markets in the region. \nBy supporting the establishment of the CGIM, the TA will help (i) increase the attractiveness of \nusing local currency bond markets for potential issuers, (ii) ensure the efficiency of regional \nbond markets, and (iii) broaden and diversify the investor base by bridging the credit quality gap \nprevalent  in  SME  financing.  In  addition,  the  TA  will  (i)   help  enhance  credit  to  structured \nfinancing for infrastructure and other development projects; (ii) streamline organizational and \nregulatory  procedures  for  bond  market  access;  and  (iii) enhance  transparency,  corporate \ngovernance,  and  disclosure  standards.  Developing  deep  and  mature  local  currency  bond \nmarkets in the region is a key component for financial market stability in the region, supporting \nkey result areas of the Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI). \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will be composed of two parts.  \n                                                 \n6  There is no single MDI that is a perfect benchmark for the CGIM. However, the International Finance Corporation \nand European Bank for Reconstruction and Development are perhaps the most appropriate benchmarks from a \nbusiness perspective, especially as their structure includes both debt and equity. \n7  A good benchmark for this option is perhaps the European Union\u2019s specialized vehicle for venture capital and \nguarantees, the European Investment Fund (EIF)\u2014a member of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Group. As of \n9 October 2006, EIF shareholders include the EIB (61.35%), the European Commission (30%), and 26 European \nbanks and financial institutions (8.65%). \n8  A benchmark for this option would be to establish a facility support fund within ADB\u2014the ADB ABMI Regional \nGuarantee and Investment Mechanism\u2014utilizing ADB\u2019s existing guarantee, loan, and equity investment structures. \nAnother benchmark could be the Multilateral Investment Fund of the Inter-American Development Bank Group.  \n9  Phase 1 study proposes two other options: (i) consolidating bilateral efforts, and (ii) a private and public sector \npartnership. \n ", "4   \n \n12.   Phase 2-A will thoroughly assess option one, option two, and option three.  Phase 2-A \nwill  comprise the following activities: \n \n(i)  Reestimate the potential use of the CGIM for each of the business lines by the \nfive focus countries (PRC, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand). \n(ii)  Reapply the financial projection analysis (of the three options as required) based \non the reestimated demand projections. \n(iii)  Assess  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  the  three  options  using \nbenchmarks such as (a) self-sustainability, (b) sustainability of AAA ratings, (c) \neffective  and  efficient  organizational  and  management  structure,  (d)  good \ngovernance, (e)  maximizing responsiveness and flexibility to user demand, (f) \npotential legal and regulatory impediments, (g) necessary fund mobilization, (h) \nhuman resource mobilization, (i)  project cost estimation, and (j) the timeframe for \nestablishing the CGIM. \n(iv)  Identify the best option.  \n \n13.  A  phase  2-A  report  will  be  prepared  for  review  and  discussion  by  WG2  member \ncountries. If required by the co-chairs and member countries, a consultation forum will be held \nto include potential clients and market participants, with sufficient assistance and inputs from the \nco-chairs and member countries. \n \n14.  Subject to the approval of the WG2 member countries, the second part, phase 2-B, will \nbuild a business plan for the CGIM. Under the TA, a draft proposal will be prepared with \nsufficient detail to support an investment assessment by ABMI member countries and ADB. \n \n15.  The draft proposal will incorporate the following: \n \n(i)  background and business philosophy; \n(ii)  product mix; \n(iii)  operational  and  investment  policy  (business,  investment,  and  administration \npolicies and guidelines); \n(iv)  demand prospects; \n(v)  financial projection analysis; \n(vi)  capital and structure; \n(vii)  human resources and management; and \n(viii)  a draft implementation plan and time schedule. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n17.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000, of which $200,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program and the balance of $300,000 will be financed by the \nGovernment of the People\u2019s Republic of China Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation \nFund.  Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB  will  be  the  TA  Executing  Agency  and  OREI  will  implement  the  TA  in  close \ncoordination with the ABMI WG2 co-chairs and member countries. An international consulting \nfirm  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of \nConsultants (April 2006, as amended from time to time) for implementing this TA. As the \n ", "  5\nrequired assignments by the TA are complex and specialized in nature, and have significant \nimpact  on  the  policy  dialogue  among  ASEAN+3  ABMI  member  countries,  quality-based \nselection (QBS) will be used in choosing the consulting firm. The biodata technical proposals \nwill be submitted to select the consulting firm. The team of consultants (person-months are in \nparentheses) will be composed of (i)  a financial markets specialist (international, 2); (ii) a \nproject economist (international, 1); (iii) a financial sector specialist/team leader (international,  \n4); and (iv) a project specialist (international, 4). An individual consultant (national, 6) will also \nbe hired for technical support in coordinating and facilitating the discussion and consultation \nforum with the WG2 member countries and relevant stakeholders. The scope of work and \noutline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The guidance note for the \nconsultants is in a supplementary appendix. \n \n19.  The TA is expected to start in January 2007 and to be completed in January 2008. The \nconsultants will prepare an interim phase 2-A report within 2 months from the start of consulting \nservices. The interim report will be composed of (i) draft figures of the reestimated business \nvolumes for each business line, (ii) draft results of the reapplication of the financial projection \nanalysis (of the three options as required), and (iii) preliminary assessment of the advantages \nand disadvantages of the three options using required benchmarks. The consultants will  submit \nthe final report of phase 2-A by the end of June 2007. The outline of the report is in Appendix 4. \nThe interim phase 2-B report composed of a preliminary proposal to the member countries will \nbe  prepared  by  October  2007,  and  the  draft  final  phase  2-B  report  will  be  finalized  by \nDecember 2007. After a review by WG2 member countries, the final report will be completed by \nJanuary 2008. ADB, with the assistance of the consulting firm, will also coordinate with the WG2 \nco-chairs  and  member  countries  to  hold  a  discussion  or  consultation  forum,  including  the \nrelevant stakeholders and bond market participants, as necessary. The national consultant will \nprovide technical support in coordinating and facilitating this forum.   \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Government of the Peoples\u2019 Republic of China; and (ii) ADB \nproviding the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $200,000 on a grant basis for ASEAN+3 \nRegional Guarantee and Investment Mechanism Phase 2, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumption \nSupport the policy  Development,  Bond market data and  Commitment of \ndialogue of ASEAN+3  deepening, and  indicators prepared by  governments to  capital \nAsian Bond Markets  harmonization of  Bank for International  market development   \nInitiative (ABMI) Working  regional financial  Settlements (BIS)   \nGroup (WG) 2 on Credit  markets      \nGuarantee and      Risk \nInvestment Mechanism  Mobilization of domestic    Macroeconomic \n(CGIM)  savings to the local  Country strategy  stability \nIncreasing market  currency bond markets  paper and country   \nattractiveness to    strategy paper update \npotential bond issuers,  Improved corporate   \nensuring smooth  governance \nfunctioning of regional   \nbond markets, and   \nbroadening and   \ndiversifying of the \ninvestor base \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nPromoting regional  Expanding the local  Bond market data and  Commitment of \ncooperation for  currency bond markets  indicators prepared by  governments to capital \ndeveloping robust local  in size and liquidity  BIS and other  market development   \ncurrency bond markets    institutions   \nin the region  Increasing corporate and    Commitment of ABMI \n  SME financing, utilizing  Country strategy  WG2 members to \nBridging the credit  bond markets in the  papers and country  common goals   \nquality gap for bond  region  strategy paper    \nissuance and providing    updates  Risk \ncredit enhancement to  Increasing  securitization    Coordination within and \nstructured financing  and structured financing  Market update reports  among stakeholders \nschemes  through bond markets in  by investment banks  and ABMI WG2 \n  the region    and brokers  members \nStreamlining     \norganizational and  Increasing market  Websites of ABMI \nregulatory procedures to  participants and  WG2 members  \nbond market access   broadening investment   \n  channels   Websites of the \nEnhancing transparency,  central banks and the \ncorporate governance,  securities regulators of \nhigher disclosure  ASEAN+3 member \nstandards  countries  \n   \n  AsianBondsOnline \nquarterly report \nOutputs      Assumptions \nAssessment for  Conducting dialogue  Progress  reports  of  Commitment of \nidentifying an  among ASEAN+3 ABMI  ABMI  WG2  and  the  governments to capital \norganizational option for  WG2 members and  Focal Group  market development   \nthe CGIM  holding a forum among     \n ", "Appendix 1  7\nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks \nMechanisms \nA draft business model  expanded stakeholders  AsianBondsOnline  Commitment of ABMI \nand plan for the CGIM  to help identify the  quarterly reports  WG2 members  to \nas a proposal for  preferred organizational    common goals  \nASEAN+3 member  option   \ncountries    Risk \nEndorsement by  Coordination within and \nASEAN+3 Finance  among ABMI WG2 \nMinisters Meeting   members \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n1.1 Assessing option one, option two, and option three.

The specialist/team leader will undertake these tasks: \n \n(i)  Review thoroughly the final report of TA6127 ASEAN+3 ABMI WG2 CGIM. \n(ii)  Outline  the  prototype  model  of  each  of  the  three  options,  based  on  the \nrecommendation of TA6127 and the Supplementary Appendix. This prototype model \nshould show how the CGIM under each option will (a) obtain sufficient funding to \noperate the mechanism; (b) fund a return (if any) to the countries contributing to its \nestablishment; (c) obtain sufficient human resources to ensure that the CGIM can \nbe subject to due diligence, marketed, contracted for, priced and administered; (d) \nset in place the required prudential limits to ensure satisfactory sustainability; (e) \nestablish  suitable  business  processes  to  ensure  that  each  intervention  is \nconsistently reviewed and approved; (f) attract, as beneficiary, satisfactory privileges \nand  immunities  with  respect  to  business  undertaken  in  each  of  the  five  focus \ncountries; and (g) recover from the relevant sovereigns losses attributable to actions \nor omissions of such countries. \n(iii)  Work together with the financial markets specialist and the project economist to \nreapply the financial projection analysis to the prototype models of the three options. \nAssess the pros and cons of the three options using the following criteria: (a) ease \nof establishing the CGIM: this parameter will take into account time and cost of \nestablishing the CGIM; complexity of structure; ability to borrow and adapt existing \nworking arrangements to apply as framework to the CGIM; ability to develop and \napply  workable  business  processes,  thus  assuring  investors  of  adequate \ngovernance;  (b)  structural  issues:  this  parameter  will  take  into  account  any \ninefficiencies in the proposed structure relating to (1) capital efficiency, (2) obtaining \nrequired  funds  or  contingent  funding  obligations,  (3)  obtaining  and/or  allocating \nadequate human resources to assure the success of the CGIM; (4) geographical \nissues; (5) legal or competition restrictions, including conflicts of interest between \nthe CGIM and any other commitment of the five focus countries, (6) growth prospect:  \nthis  parameter  will  explore  factors  that  may  enhance  or  inhibit  the  growth  of \nbusiness  of  the  CGIM,  such  as  goodwill,  image,  market  perception,  brand \nawareness, and market confidence related to transaction completion risk; (c) losses \nand divestment: (1) How will focus countries resolve financial losses should they \noccur; how should investor credit risk be treated? Should liability be shared jointly or \nseverally?  (2)  If  option  three  were  implemented,  how  would  ADB  mitigate  \nreputational risk, and risk of financial loss (note that under option three, ADB would \nbe  the  guarantor/investor/lender  of  record,  regardless  of  the  underlying  funding \narrangements)? (3) What would be the tenor of the proposed structure  and how will \nthe member countries recover their initial investment? \n(iv)  Identify the best of the three options and prepare an assessment report to be \nsubmitted to the member countries. \n(v)  In  cooperation  with  ADB,  conduct  and  facilitate  a  consultation  forum  with  the \npotential clients, market participants, and other stakeholders in each focus country, \nas required, with sufficient assistance from each Government. \n \nD.   Project Specialist (international, 4 person-months) \n \n5.  The specialist will undertake these tasks: \n \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n(i)  Prepare  a  business  plan  for  the  CGIM  option  selected  by  the  financial  sector \nspecialist,  incorporating the views obtained at the consultation forum.  \n(ii)  Subject to further discussion and consultation with the WG2 member countries and \nco-chairs (the PRC and the Republic of Korea), identify the composition of the \nproposal. The proposal will include at least the following items: (a) background and \nbusiness  philosophy;  (b)  product  mix;  (c)  operational  and  investment  policy \n(business,  investment,  and  administration  policy,  and  guidelines);  (d)  demand \nprospects;  (e)  financial  projection  analysis;  (f)  capital  and  structure;  (g)  human \nresources and management; and (h) a draft implementation plan and time schedule. \n(ii)  Prepare  a  proposal  for  setting  up  the  CGIM  with  sufficient  details  to  support  \nassessment of the investment by member countries and ADB. \n(iii)  In cooperation with ADB, conduct and facilitate a consultation forum with  potential \nclients,  market  participants,  and  other  stakeholders  in  each  focus  country,  as \nrequired, with sufficient assistance from each Government. \n \n \nE.

Reestimation of the potential use of the credit guarantee and investment mechanism (CGIM) \nfor business lines by the five focus countries (People\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, \nPhilippines, and Thailand)  \n \n2.   Outline  of  the  prototype  model  of  each  of  the  three  options:  (i)  a  new  independent \nmultilateral development institution (MDI) structured on a stand-alone basis, (ii) an MDI structured \nas a subsidiary or affiliate of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), and (iii) an expansion of the \nexisting facilities of ADB. \n \n3.   Analysis of the financial projection for the three options as required,  reidentifying and \nrevalidating the assumptions for the financial model, integrating the raw demand estimates with the \nfinancial model using the investment guidelines, and identifying best practices in capital allocation \nfor the three options.  \n \n4.   Assessment of the pros and cons of the three options using benchmarks such as the \nfollowing: \n \n(i)  Ease  of  establishment  of  the  CGIM:  (a)  time  and  cost  of  establishing  it;  (b) \ncomplexity  of  structure;  (c)  ability  to  borrow  and  adapt  existing  working \narrangements to apply as framework to the CGIM; and (d) ability to develop and \napply  workable  business  processes,  thus  assuring  investors  of  adequate \ngovernance. \n \n(ii)  Structural issues:  any inefficiencies in the proposed structure relating to (a) capital \nefficiency;  (b)  obtaining  required  funds  or  contingent  funding  obligations;  (c) \nobtaining  and/or  allocating  adequate  human  resources  to  assure  the  CGIM  of \nsuccess; (d) geographical issues; and (e) legal or competition restrictions, including \nconflicts of interest between the CGIM and any other commitment of the five focus \ncountries. \n \n(iii)  Growth prospect:  factors that may enhance or inhibit the growth of business of the \nCGIM: these will include (a) goodwill, (b) image, (c) market perception, (d) brand \nawareness, and (e) market confidence related to transaction completion risk. \n \n(iv)   Losses and divestment: (a) How will focus countries resolve financial losses, should \nthey occur; how should investor credit risk be treated?

(b) If option three were implemented, how would ADB mitigate \n(1) reputational risk, and (2) risk of financial loss (note ADB under option three \nwould  be  the  guarantor/investor/lender  of  record,  regardless  of  the  underlying \nlending arrangements)? (c) What would be the tenor of the proposed structure  and \nhow will the member countries recover their initial investment?  \n \n5.
