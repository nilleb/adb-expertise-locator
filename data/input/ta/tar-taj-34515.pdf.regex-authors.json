The  Government  of  Tajikistan  requested  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  project \npreparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)1 for  the  Power  Rehabilitation  Phase  II  Project.  This \nrequest was considered by ADB, and the TA was included in the 2003 country strategy and \nprogram. A fact-finding mission visited Tajikistan from 28 February to 7 March 2005. At that \ntime, a field visit was conducted and discussions were held with representatives from Barki Tajik \nState Joint Stock Company (BT), Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Finance, and other relevant \nagencies. The Fact-Finding Mission and the Government reached an understanding on the TA\u2019s \ngoals, purpose, scope, implementation arrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms \nof reference. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Tajikistan is one of the poorest former Soviet Union countries, with an estimated per \ncapita income of about $310 in 2004. The Government is implementing reforms. As a result of \nthese reforms, the annual gross domestic product growth rate turned positive in 1997 and has \naveraged 9.5% between 2001 and 2003. In 2003, the poorest regions were Gorno Badakhshan \nand Khatlon, with overall poverty rates of 84.0% and 78.0%, respectively.2  \n \n3.  The Government developed a poverty reduction strategy paper in 2002 that underscored \nthe essential role of the infrastructure sector. The paper recognized that reliable infrastructure \nservices (i) contribute to improved living conditions and are essential for economic growth,  \n(ii) enhance freedom of movement, and (iii) improve access to health care and education. The \nGovernment\u2019s main objective in the infrastructure sector is to provide access to reliable and \naffordable public services in the areas of energy, transport, information and communication, and \nprovision of safe drinking water. \n \n4.  A  lack  of  new  investment  has  led  to  considerable  deterioration  of  the  physical \ninfrastructure. Combined with Tajikistan\u2019s inability to access adequate fossil fuels, infrastructure \ndeterioration has seriously reduced the reliability of electricity, gas, and heat supplies. The \npower system was mostly built during the 1960s and 1970s, and a lack of funds and consequent \nshortage or absence of spare parts have led to the physical deterioration of existing equipment, \nleaving the system extremely vulnerable. Adding to these problems, the load pattern has shifted \nfrom industrial to residential consumers. This shift results in higher losses from overloaded \ntransmission lines and transformers. Overall estimated technical losses currently amount to \nabout 15%.  \n \n5.  The installed power generation capacity is 4,405 megawatts (MW), comprising mainly \nsix large hydropower plants (HPPs) totaling 4,060 MW (92%) and two fossil fuel-fired combined \nheat and power stations totaling 345 MW (8%). Annual hydropower energy output is about \n16,000 gigawatt-hours (GWh), and the country has an extensive electricity system that provides \naccess to nearly 100% of the population.  \n \n6.  Tajikistan has three separate power systems: the southern system, the northern system, \nand the eastern system. The southern system (including Dushanbe) is the main system, with \ninstalled generation capacity of 3,910 MW, out of which 3,895 MW are located on the Vakhsh \nRiver. The northern system (Soghd Region) covers the Fergana Valley of the Syr Darya River \nplains.  This  system  has  a  capacity  of  126  MW.  The  eastern  system  (Gorno  Badakhshan \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 2 January 2003. \n2  World Bank. 2005. Tajikistan Poverty Assessment Update. Washington, DC. \n ", "2   \nAutonomous Region) covers a sparsely populated mountainous region. This system has a \ncapacity of 23 MW. The annual demands for each system are about 12.00 GWh, 4.00 GWh, \nand 0.13 GWh, respectively.  \n \n7.  The southern and the northern systems have generation deficits in winter and rely on \nenergy imported from Uzbekistan. In Soghd and Khatlon regions, the average electricity supply \nduring winter is currently 2\u20133 hours per day. This is due to lower river flows, which depend on \nmelting snow.  \n \n8.  The 3,000 MW Nurek HPP has operated for over 30 years. The power plant provides \nmost  of  the  energy  needed  in  Tajikistan  and  also  stabilizes  power  system  operation  in \nKazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan, which have interconnected systems. However, \nsoil subsidence has placed the Nurek switchyards at serious risk of collapse.3 Unless they are \nrelocated  to  a  stable  geological  area,  further  underground  erosion  will  cause  a  complete \nshutdown of Nurek HPP, which will stop power supply to most of Tajikistan. The Government \nhas sought assistance from Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau (KfW) for Nurek HPP\u2019s rehabilitation. \nBased on an intergovernmental agreement signed in December 2004, KfW is implementing TA \nfor preparing this project, which is expected to be completed by April 2006. ADB has provided \ninputs for the terms of reference and would use this TA outcome to prepare its assistance \nrelated to Nurek HPP. \n \n9.  The Office of the President\u2019s Fuel and Energy Department has oversight responsibility \nfor the energy sector. The Ministry of Energy, established in October 2000, is responsible for \ncoordinating the Government\u2019s energy policy. The Committee for Anti-Monopoly and Promotion \nof Small Enterprises, which reports directly to the Office of the President, regulates the prices of \nelectricity and natural gas and district heat. \n \n10.  BT, a vertically integrated and state-owned utility, is responsible for power generation, \ntransmission, and distribution in the northern and southern power systems. The privately owned \nPamir Energy Company is responsible for operating all power facilities in Gorno Badakshan \nAutonomous Region, under a development partner-funded program.4 \n \n11.  Poor collection from customers by BT has been a serious concern. Accounts receivable \nin December 2003 were equivalent to 6.5 months of billing.5  The high rate of uncollected fees \nwas attributed to weakness in commercial management and past accumulation by (i) Tajik \nAluminum  Smelter  (TADAZ),  when  commodity  prices  were  low;  (ii)  farmers,  because  of \nseasonal harvests and the large share of barter trade; and (iii) household consumers, because \nof low household incomes and a lack of proper metering. Collection from most major consumer \ncategories improved in 2004. For industrial and commercial categories, collection was over \n100%.6 For the residential category, collection improved to 83%, from 61%. For the agriculture \ncategory, collection improved to 64%, from 30%. TADAZ, which accounted for about 42% of \nsales, was the main exception; collection decreased to 86%, from 97%, due to adjustments in \nbilling. The World Bank is now preparing the Energy Losses Reduction Project, which would \ninclude the installation of energy meters for consumers in Dushanbe and further help improve \ncollection. \n \n                                                 \n3  Emergency repair of switchyard foundations is being carried out using counterpart funds under the ongoing Power \nRehabilitation Project (footnote 8). \n4  In 2002, the World Bank provided a $10.0 million loan. International Finance Corporation provided $8.0 million \n($3.5 million in equity and $4.5 million in debt). The Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development provided $8.0 \nmillion in equity. The Government of Switzerland provided a grant of $5.0 million and technical support. \n5  BT. 2003. Report and Consolidated Financial Statements. Dushanbe. \n6  Collection rate above 100% includes dues on previous billing. \n ", "  3\n12.  The average electricity tariff increased by about 100% in 2002 and 2003. Consumers are \noffered discounts during summer, to reflect the low opportunity cost of generating power by \nusing the high spillage from dam reservoirs. The average tariff is much lower than that needed \nfor a full recovery of asset replacement cost.7 Households in the lowest income quintile are \ncurrently spending around 16% of their income on electricity, and this proportion could increase, \nunless suitable measures are included with tariff increases. \n \n13.  The  scope  of  the  Power  Rehabilitation  Project,8 which  comprises  ADB\u2019s  ongoing \nassistance, includes the urgently needed rehabilitation of transmission and distribution systems \nin Khatlon Region, as well as rehabilitation work for Central HPP and Nurek HPP, on the \nVakhsh River, and distribution work in Dushanbe. This project is experiencing implementation \ndelays, mainly in awarding contracts, because of a lack of understanding of ADB guidelines and \ncapacity to carry these out. \n \n14.  The Regional Power Transmission Modernization Project9 has not yet been declared \neffective, because of the difficulty in securing the Government of Uzbekistan\u2019s agreement on the \nPower  Trade  Relations  Agreement.  This  agreement  will  help  increase  revenue  through \nexporting  electricity  during  summer  months,  when  water  flows  are  very  high  and  national \ndemand is low. \n \n15.  Several  options  exist  for  improving  winter  power  supply  in  Khatlon  Region.  These \ninclude  \n(i)  adding new generation capacity for winter systems; \n(ii)  rehabilitating and uprating existing HPPs that can deliver energy even during \n  low water flows;  \n(iii)  rehabilitating  and  uprating  transmission  and  distribution  networks,  to  reduce \n  losses; \n(iv)  developing demand-side management options, to use energy efficiently; and \n(v)  increasing tariffs and improving metering and bill collection, to promote more  \nefficient use of electricity and at the same time strengthen BT\u2019s financial health. \n \n16.  The Government requested assistance for power sector improvements. Accordingly, the \nTA  and  ensuing  Project  will  support  grid  strengthening,  power  generation,  and  institution \nstrengthening. The proposed Project is in line with ADB\u2019s country strategy, which focuses on the \ndevelopment of the power and transport sectors and the rural development sector. The Project \nis also in line with ADB\u2019s ongoing assistance, which focuses on rehabilitating existing facilities in \nthe southern system. A summary initial poverty and social analysis is attached as Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n7  BT has extremely low fuel and other financial costs, so present revenue is adequate to meet operating expenses. \nThe generation and extensive network assets are very old (average age of over 30 years) and considerably \nundervalued. An asset revaluation study is being undertaken by the Government, and its results are expected by \nthe end of 2005. Meanwhile, the World Bank estimated the tariff level based on the economic cost of the additional \nsupply at $0.021 per kilowatt-hour, whereas the present tariff is $0.006 per kilowatt-hour. \n8  ADB. 2000.

The project preparatory TA will prepare the ensuing investment Project, which will aim \n(depending on the outcome of the study) to rehabilitate and uprate the existing facilities in \nsouthern Tajikistan, covering generation, transmission, and distribution. The TA will also review \nthe power sector and propose a sector development plan, to insure the investment\u2019s long-term \nsustainability.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n18.  The TA will be implemented in two stages. Stage 1 will consist of two levels of analysis. \nFirst, potential subprojects and policy options for reducing the winter supply and demand gap \nwill be identified, and an assessment of their costs and technical feasibility and likely impacts \n(economic and social) will be made. Second, after ruling out infeasible technical options, this \ninformation will be incorporated into an analysis of the least-cost strategy for reducing the winter \npower  deficit  in  the  southern  system.  The  final  product  of  this  stage  will  be  a  least-cost \ndevelopment plan, including a ranking of subprojects based on cost-effectiveness.  \n \n19.  The expected outputs of stage 1 are \n(i)  a review of sector issues (tariffs, billing and revenue collection, and losses and \ninstitutional issues);  \n(ii)  an assessment and forecast of the power demand under likely and optimal (i.e., \ndemand-side-management) pricing and metering regimes, by voltage level, \nconsumer class, season, and time of day); \n(iii)  a preliminary assessment of the uprating possibilities (including metering) for \ngeneration,  transmission,  and  distribution  facilities  in  the  southern  system, \nbearing in mind that the critical generators are the four HPPs on the Vakhsh \nRiver and that the Project\u2019s geographic focus is Khatlon Region, which means \nthe distribution systems in this area will be considered; \n(iv)  an estimate of the cost and feasibility of new generation capacity; \n(v)  a least-cost analysis, leading to a ranking of the preferred subprojects according \n  to pricing recommendations and the cost of relieving winter constraints; and  \n(vi)  an  assessment  of  the  demand-side  management  measures  that  will  help \n  balance winter supply and demand. \n \n20.  Stage 2 will consist of the preparation of a power sector development plan10 and detailed \nfeasibility studies of the highest ranked subprojects. The technical, economic, and financial \nviability of the resulting Project will be evaluated, and a financing plan will be developed. The \nexpected outputs of stage 2 are \n(i)  a policy matrix for energy development, considering sector reforms,    \n    transparency and financial stability, energy efficiency, tariff issues, and other  \n    factors; \n(ii)  an assessment of the technical, financial, social, economic, and environmental \nviability of investments that are being proposed for financial support; and \n(iii)  an assessment of capacity-building and institutional strengthening needs and \n  a plan to address these and complete about 2-days of training for government  \nand executing agency staff members, to improve their understanding of ADB  \nguidelines and procurement and disbursement procedures. \n \n                                                 \n10 This would be an update of the energy sector action plan prepared with the Power Rehabilitation Project. \n ", "  5\n21.  The social impacts of the proposed Project are anticipated to be positive, due to the \nincreased electricity supply, particularly to the poor during winter, in areas where electricity \nsupply is currently limited. While an expected tariff increase could burden poor households, the \nincrease would encourage energy conservation and be partly offset by a suitable targeted \nsubsidy program. Negative social impacts will be limited, as no land acquisition is expected. \n \n22.  The ensuing Project is expected to include very little construction of new facilities, so \nadverse environmental impacts will be minimal. Positive environmental impacts are anticipated \nfrom the replacement of fuelwood and agricultural waste with electricity for indoor heating. A \nsubsequent reduction in deforestation and health impacts is also anticipated. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n23.  The total cost of the TA is $625,000 equivalent, including a foreign exchange component \nof $445,000 and a local currency component of $180,000 equivalent. ADB will finance $500,000 \nequivalent,  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $55,000  equivalent  of  the  local \ncurrency cost. TA cost estimates are presented in Appendix 3. The Government will finance \nthe balance of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government has been informed that \napproval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing investment projects.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n24.  BT will be the TA\u2019s Executing Agency. Implementation of the proposed TA will benefit \nfrom knowledge and experience gained by BT staff members through the implementation of \nongoing ADB projects and TAs. \n \n25.  The  TA  will  require  16  person-months  of  international  consultant  services  and  36 \nperson-months  of  domestic  consultant  services.  The  consulting  team  will  comprise \nelectromechanical, civil engineering, financial and economics, and environmental and social \ndevelopment specialists. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in accordance with the \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A simplified \ntechnical proposal format and the quality- and cost-based selection method will be used.  \n \n26.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 8 months, from 15 August 2005 to 15 April \n2006. An inception report will be submitted in September 2005, the phase 1 report in November \n2005, and a draft final report in February 2006. The draft final report will be finalized in March \n2006, after incorporating comments from the Government and ADB during the final tripartite \nmeeting. No major risks are associated with the TA, and the Government has expressed its \nstrong support. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n27.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Tajikistan for preparing the Power Rehabilitation Phase II Project, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions \nand Indicators  and Risks \n       \nImpact      Assumption \n      \u2022  Energy demand \nReliable power supply  Increased export of  National statistics  continues to increase \nand greater use of  electricity during summer     \nclean hydropower in      Risks \nsouthern Tajikistan and  Increased winter  BT operating results and  \u2022  Change in Government \nneighboring countries  generation in southern  sales  priorities \n  system (kilowatt-hour per    \u2022  Delay in the \n  customer per year)    implementation of the \n    Power Development \nIncreased reliability of  Customer surveys  Plan \ntransmission and   \ndistribution supply in   \nsouthern system   \n   \nImproved financial  BT financial statements \nsituation of Barki Tajik \nJoint Stock Company \n(BT) \n       \nOutcome      Assumption \n      \u2022  Effective stakeholder \nProject design and  Memorandum of  Consultant final report  participation and \nfeasibility study agreed,  understanding of final    ownership developed \ncovering necessary  tripartite meeting signed  Memorandum of   \nrehabilitation and  by the Government and  understanding  Risks \nuprating in Khatlon  the Asian Development    \u2022  Availability of funds to \nRegion, in the context  Bank (ADB)  Back-to-Office Report  include all high-priority \nof a power sector    (BTOR) of final technical  subprojects in the \ndevelopment plan     assistance review mission  ensuing Project \n    \u2022  Implementation delays \n \n       \nOutputs      Assumptions \n      \u2022  Availability and access \n1.
