Technical assistance \n(TA) for Capacity Building for SME Development is included. \n   \nRationale  Economic activity in Cambodia is dominated by small and medium \nenterprises (SMEs), which are seen as playing a major role in \neconomic growth and poverty reduction. The proposed program \nloan is the first Asian Development Bank (ADB) policy loan to \nCambodia designed to lay the foundation for SME development \nand  foster  an  enabling  business  environment.  Extensive \nconsultation  with  the  Government  and  other  stakeholders \nidentified  the  primary  issues  and  constraints  impinging  on  the \nSME sector; these are addressed in the Program. \n \nAlthough  the  Government  recognizes  the  importance  of  the \nsector, significant legal, institutional, and governance reforms are \nneeded for effective SME development. First, the costs of doing \nbusiness are high due to limitations of the current regulatory and \ngovernance structures. Second, the missing legal structures and \ninstitutions lead to a high-risk lending environment, which limits \nSME access to key resources, particularly finance. Finally, the \nGovernment lacks an institutional and coordinated framework to \nfacilitate SME development, and in many instances the capacity to \naddress these issues. These factors underlie the sector's main \nbarriers to development, reflected by limited growth, informality, \nand underemployment. \n ", "  iii \n \n \n  Fostering  an  environment  conducive  to  SME  development  is \n  widely considered a priority. The main issues for the Program \n  were selected on the basis of (i) significance for SMEs' current \n  business operations, (ii) Government commitment to reform in line \n  with  international  experience,  (iii)  ADB's  past  and  ongoing \n  operations,  and  (iv)  complementarities  with  other  development \nactivities. \n \nObjective   The Program\u2019s objective is to support the Government\u2019s efforts to \n  create an environment that is conducive to business development. \n  This is particularly important for improving opportunities for SME \n  development. The Program focuses on  \n   \n  (i)  establishing an SME development framework: (a) provide \n  a long-term strategic framework for SME development, (b) \n  design  an  institutional  framework  to  seek  better  policy \n  coordination and implementation among key Government \n  agencies, and (c) promote public-private partnerships and \n  strengthen  institutions  to  effectively  implement  the \n  development framework;  \n   \n  (ii) improving  governance  and  regulatory  reform  related  to \n  SMEs: (a) improve the business registration process by \n  enhancing  its  transparency  and  reducing  costs  by \n  eliminating  unnecessary  requirements,  and  facilitating \n  decentralization of registration processes; and (b) reform \n  the current business licensing system by reviewing and \n  removing  unnecessary  licenses  and  requirements, \n  streamlining  the  procedures  and  responsibilities  of \n  institutions  involved,  and  establishing  a  one-stop \n  information window to provide guidelines and information \n  on relevant Government regulations for SMEs; and  \n   \n(iii) enhancing SMEs\u2019 access to finance: (a) create simplified \n \naccounting sets that are better suited to SMEs' needs and \n \ncapabilities, (b) develop a leasing framework as a potential \n \nalternative financing source for SMEs, and (c) establish a \n \ncredit-information system for the banking sub-sector. \n \n \n  The Program Framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nCost Estimates  The total loan amount for the Program is determined on the basis \nof the strategic importance of developing the SME sector and the \ncosts of structural reforms to be supported under the Program. \nSuch  costs  arising  from  reform  measures  to  be  implemented \nunder the Program are estimated to be around $25 million to $30 \nmillion  equivalent  during  the  36  months  planned  for  program \nimplementation. \n ", "iv   \nLoan Amount and Terms   A loan of $20 million equivalent from the Special Funds resources \nof  ADB  will  be  provided  The  loan  will  have  a  24-year  term \nincluding a grace period of 8 years, an interest rate or 1.0% per \nannum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft loan \nagreement.  \n \nCounterpart Funds  The  policy  framework  for  the  Program  includes  specific \n  components  with  distinct  structural  adjustment  costs.  The \n  Government has provided assurances that the necessary funding \n  will be made available to meet those costs.  \n   \nProgram Period and   The  Program  will  be  implemented  over  36  months  from  loan \nTranching  effectiveness. The loan will be disbursed in three tranches: (i) $7 \nmillion upon fulfillment of specified first tranche release conditions \nupon  loan  effectiveness,  (ii)  $8  million  subject  to  fulfillment  of \nspecified  second  tranche  release  conditions  approximately  18 \nmonths  after  loan  effectiveness,  and  (iii)  $5  million  subject  to \nfulfillment of specified third tranche release conditions within 36 \nmonths (expected) after loan effectiveness. \n   \nEstimated Program  31 December 2007  \nCompletion Date   \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME)  \n \nImplementation  To  coordinate  program  implementation  among  Government \nArrangements  ministries and agencies concerned, a program steering committee \n  (PSC) will be formed. The PSC, chaired by the minister of MIME, \n  will comprise senior officers from all ministries and Government \n  agencies concerned (Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Economy \n  and  Finance,  Ministry  of  Planning,  and  National  Bank  of \n  Cambodia). The PSC will meet at least twice yearly to review \n  pending issues on the Program and propose concrete actions for \n  their resolution. \n   \nProcurement  The loan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, \nsubject to a negative list of ineligible items. All procurement of \ngoods  and  services  produced  in and  originating  from  member \ncountries of ADB will be made with due consideration to economy \nand  efficiency  in  accordance  with  standard  public  sector \nprocedures in Cambodia and normal private sector commercial \npractices, acceptable to ADB. The Government will certify that the \nvalue  of  total  imports  minus  (i)  imports  from  nonmember \ncountries,  (ii)  ineligible  imports,  and  (iii)  disbursements  made \nunder other official development assistance, is greater than the \namount expected to be disbursed during the year. ADB will have \nthe right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to verify the \naccuracy of the Government's certification. \n   \n ", "  v \nRisks and Assumptions  Successful implementation of the Program entails three risks. The \nfirst  relates  to  a  lack  of  capacity  within  the  Government  to \nimplement some of the complex reforms. In previous programs, \ndelays  were  caused  predominantly  by  the  lack  of  technical \nexpertise.  To  address  this  risk,  an  advisory  TA  has  been \ndesigned,  in  coordination  with  other  development  agencies  to \nsupport Program implementation, and engage in capacity-building \nmeasures for relevant Government officials. \n \n  A  second  risk  relates  to  lack  of  coordination  among  various \nGovernment agencies. The Program requires close coordination \namong the relevant authorities\u2014both horizontally among different \nministries  and  agencies  concerned,  and  vertically  with  the \nprovincial and district authorities. Consultation and coordination \nwill  also  be  required  with  other  stakeholders  active  in  SME \ndevelopment.  The  Program  design  addresses  this  risk  by \nemphasizing  the  use  of  interagency  coordination  mechanisms, \nparticularly by establishing an inter-ministerial coordination body \n(National SME Subcommittee) with private sector participation. \n \nA third risk relates to good governance of the central and local \ngovernment authorities. Local governance is particularly important \nas that is where the Program will have the most direct impact on \nSMEs.  The  Government  is  addressing  these  risks,  which  are \ncommon  to  several  programs,  through  implementation  of  the \ncomprehensive  Public  Financial  Management  Program, \n(supported by several development agencies, including ADB).  \n \nTechnical Assistance  The Government asked ADB to provide TA to build capacity for \nSME development for $0.85 million. The TA will be financed by \nADB ($500,000), and the Government of Denmark ($350,000). \nThe  TA  will  focus  on  (i)  technical,  legal,  and  policy-related \nassistance  to  the  reform  agenda  based  on  international \nexperience;  (ii)  institution  building  activities,  including  fostering \ngood governance and pilot implementation of new systems; and \n(iii) new approaches to training and information dissemination. \n \n \n ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto  the  Kingdom  of  Cambodia  for  the  Small  and  Medium  Enterprise  (SME)  Development \nProgram  (the  Program).  The  report  also  provides  proposed  technical  assistance  (TA)  for \nCapacity Building for SME Development, and if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting \nunder the authority delegated to me by the Board, will approve the TA. The program framework \nis presented in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  THE MACROECONOMIC CONTEXT \n2.  Cambodia has a population of approximately 13.3 million people, with more than 80% \nliving in rural areas. Over 5 million, or 37% of the population, live below the poverty line, with \n90% of these in the rural sector. With moderate economic growth over the last decade, gross \ndomestic product (GDP) per capita remains low at about $300.  \n \nTable 1: Basic Economic Indicators \n \nItem  1995  1998  2000  2003 \nPopulation (in million)  10.5  12.2  12.8   13.3 \nGDP per Capita (current $)   \u2013\u2013 252.0 279.0  307.0\nGDP (in $ billion)a  3.4 3.1 3.6  4.1\nAgriculture (%)  50.4 47.1 39.6  37.2\nIndustry (%)  15.0 17.9 23.3  26.8\nService (%)  34.6 35.0 37.1  36.0\nExchange Rate (riel per $1)b  2,450.8 3,744.4 3,840.8  3,984.0\nExport (in $ million)  853.9 912.9 1,327.1  1,917.0\nImport (in $ million)  1,187.0 1,073.2 1,536.2  2,469.0\nLabor Force (\u2019000)   \u2013\u2013 \u2013\u2013 5,408.8  \u2013\u2013\nMoney Supply (M2) (% of growth)c  44.3 15.7 26.9  15.3\nM2 (% of GDP)  7.8 10.6 13.3  20.3\nInterest Rates (%)d   \u2013\u2013- 11.1 7.2  7.0\n\u2013\u2013 = no data available, GDP = gross domestic product. \na  At current producers\u2019 prices. \nb  Average of period. \nc  Annual change. \nd  Deposit, 12 months. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. 2004. Key Economic Indicators-Cambodia (www.adb.org/statistics). \n \n3.  In  terms  of  the  three  major  sectors\u2014agriculture,  manufacturing,  and  services,  the \nmanufacturing sector has been the most dynamic. By 2003, the manufacturing sector had \ngrown in importance to account for almost 27% of GDP and 8% of employment. This was \nprimarily driven by growth in the garment industry. The textiles, footwear, and garment industry \naccounts for 12.5% of GDP, and in 2002 its exports accounted for almost 70% of Cambodia's \ntotal exports ($1.2 billion). Approximately 90% of employees in the garment sector are working \nin foreign-owned companies. The service sector has been steady in terms of GDP accounting \nfor around 33\u201336%. The tourism sector is also heavily influenced by foreign investments with \napproximately two-thirds of all approved capital investment coming from abroad. The agriculture \nsector continues to be the main sector in terms of GDP and employment. In 2002, agriculture \naccounted for about 37% of GDP and over 70% of employment.  \n ", "2  \n4.  Cambodia\u2019s achievements in enhancing development and reducing poverty have been \nsignificant.  Since  the  mid  1980s,  the  Government  has  embarked  on  economic  reforms, \nbeginning with the restoration of private property rights and the lifting of price controls. Most \nstate-owned enterprises were privatized, and increased incentives were provided to local and \nforeign private investment. The signing of the Paris Peace Accord in 1991 put an end to the \nprotracted  civil  wars  and  triggered  rehabilitation  of  the  economy.  After  the  1993  general \nelections  and  the  enactment  of  the  Constitution,  the  Government  began  formulating \ncomprehensive macroeconomic and structural reforms, and achieved some significant success \nin stabilizing the economy.1  \n \n5.  Despite these achievements, the existing legal and regulatory framework for supporting \nenterprise  activities  remains  limited  with  many  necessary  laws  and subdecrees  still  in  the \ndrafting process or awaiting approval by the Council of Ministers or the National Assembly.2 The \npassage and implementation of these laws will provide further building blocks for establishing an \nenabling business environment for enterprises. Furthermore, the Government\u2019s ability to foster \nan enabling environment for business remains weak. This seems to be primarily because of a \nlack of capacity and transparency in aspects of public administration, compounding Cambodia's \ncurrent limitations on commercial regulations and institutions. Thus, Cambodia's main task is to \ndevelop an enabling environment based on technically sound and transparent legal as well as \ninstitutional systems, aiming to foster a more developed and vibrant commercial sector. \n \nIII.  THE SECTOR \nA.  Sector Description and Performance \n6.  SMEs (including micro-enterprises) are estimated to dominate Cambodia\u2019s economy in \nterms of number of firms (up to 99%) and employment (estimated 45%). In 2002, the Ministry of \nIndustry,  Mines,  and  Energy  (MIME)  estimated3 that  the  approximately  26,000  industrial \nestablishments in Cambodia.  It also reported that there has been about 12% growth in the \nnumber  of  medium  sized  enterprises  (those  with  from  30  to  100  employees)  since  1999. \nAlthough textiles and apparel are predominant, diversity is greater among the types of medium-\nsize enterprises, including food processing, chemicals, rubber, plastic, and fabricated metal. \nAppendix 2 provides a more detailed sector profile, including geographic distribution of SMEs, \nsector performance, and presence of female workers in SMEs. \n \n7.  Obtaining accurate data on the SME sector is difficult as many industrial establishments \nare unregistered or unlicensed.4  Data provided by MIME show that of the 18,639 small rice-\nmilling enterprises, almost 10,000 are unregistered or unlicensed. Including the rice-millers, food \nprocessors account for 80% of the 21,568 small enterprises. More than 11,000 do not have \noperating permits. Of the 1,417 small textile and garment enterprises, more than 90% do not \nhave operating licenses.5  \n                                                 \n1  Cambodia has achieved rates of inflation well below 4% since 1999. The exchange rate remained broadly stable at \naround KR4,000 per dollar in 2003, with inflation averaging only 1.2%.   \n2  Currently at least seven major legal documents are being considered by the Government, including laws on (i) \ncommercial enterprise, (ii) contracts, (iii) insolvency, (iv) secured transactions, (v) civil code and procedures, (vi) \ncommercial arbitration, and (vii) commercial court. \n3  MIME carries out an annual survey of industrial enterprises through its provincial-municipal departments. \n4  Currently, the Government has no official definition of SMEs. The draft Law on Factory Management, for example, \ncategorizes SMEs as those with registered capital of less than $1 million, while other ministries have a working \ndefinition of SMEs based on number of employees. \n5  Just over 1% of the total number of industrial enterprises in Cambodia are estimated to have registered, and thus \ncan be considered part of the formal sector. \n ", "  3 \n \n8.  In sum, the SME sector can be generally profiled as largely informal and most active in \nthe  agriculture  sector. However,  based  on  data  provided  by  MIME,  the  importance  of  the \nmanufacturing sector is rising, as well as growth of medium-size enterprises (those with from 30 \nto 100 employees). Given the importance of SMEs to the economy, significant reforms are \nneeded to ensure that the sector can achieve the Government's goals for economic growth and \npoverty reduction.  \n \n9.  To better identify the major challenges, and to define priorities in relation to SMEs, the \nprogram  preparatory  TA6 prepared  a  comprehensive  SME  development  framework.  The \nframework  entails  a  6-year  development  plan,  which  addresses  several  important  issues \nincluding business regulations and SME access to finance. In preparing the framework, a \nnumber of surveys were reviewed, and a series of discussions were held with SMEs, private \nsector  representatives,  Government  officials,  and  other  stakeholders  to  understand  their \nperception of the major priorities for the sector.7 A comprehensive review was undertaken to \nanalyze the status of current reforms and major development plans of the Government; and \ndevelopment agency activities were studied to avoid overlaps and identify synergies.  \n \n10.  In  addition  to  numerous  roundtable  discussions  with  Government  agencies,  the \nframework was presented to the private sector and to development agencies active in SME \ndevelopment in a series of workshops held between July and September 2004 in various \nlocations in Cambodia. Participants\u2019 feedback and comments were incorporated into the final \ndraft  of  the  SME  development  framework.  The  framework,  with  its  comprehensive  policy \nrecommendations  for  SME  development,  is  expected  to  be  the  basis  for  the  midterm, \ninterministerial framework for SME development to be adopted by the Government.  \n \nB.  Issues and Opportunities \n1.   Government Objectives and Strategy \n11.  The significance of the domestic private (mostly SME) sector is clearly indicated in the \noverall policy agenda of Cambodia. The Government issued its Second 5-Year Socio-Economic \nDevelopment Plan (2001\u20132005) and the National Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2001. Both \ndemonstrate a commitment to developing the (private) sector.8 In recognition of the sector\u2019s \nimportance, the Government established the Department of Small Industry and Handicraft within \n                                                 \n6  Asian Development Bank. 2003. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Cambodia for Preparing the Small and \nMedium Enterprise Development Program. Manila (approved in September 2003, for $500,000). \n7  An important preparatory analysis is provided by Asian Development Bank. 2002. Technical Assistance to the \nKingdom of Cambodia for Preparing a Private Sector Assessment. Manila (approved in December 2002 for \n$150,000). \n8  The Second 5-Year Socioeconomic Development Plan emphasizes the crucial role SMEs play, especially those in \nmanufacturing  and  processing,  in  generating  household  incomes  and  providing  additional  employment \nopportunities for people in rural areas. The plan notes that effective development of SMEs requires a strong \nemphasis on upgrading enterprises and continuously enhancing SME productive capacity to ensure that they \ngraduate into the formal sector and improve access to credit. The plan also notes that private sector development \nis largely dependent on sustained improvements in the governance environment, and that improving the legal \nframework for commercial transactions and strengthening the judiciary are key factors in determining whether the \nprivate sector will successfully lead the economy forward. The National Poverty Reduction Strategy identifies the \nprivate sector as playing the leading role in poverty reduction and emphasizes the Government\u2019s role in creating a \nstable macroeconomic environment through policies to create a sound financial system, improve the investment \nclimate, and implement legal and judicial reforms. In the strategy, the Government recognizes that the private \nsector needs a more competitive environment in which to operate and that governance reforms are needed.  \n ", "4  \nMIME in 2002, making it the first Cambodian agency dedicated solely to addressing SME-specific \nproblems.  \n \n12.  The  Government's  commitment  to  SME  development  is  reinforced  by  the  recent \nannouncement  of  the  Rectangular  Strategy,  which  includes  the  creation  of  National  SME \nSubcommittee to oversee policy formulation and implementation for the sector.9 At the core of \nthis strategy is good governance. Within this framework, one of the four strategic sides of the \nrectangle is identified as private sector development and employment generation. This in turn is \nbroken down into four components: (i) strengthening the private sector and attracting investment, \n(ii) creating jobs and improving working conditions, (iii) promoting SMEs, and (iv) ensuring social \nsafety nets. SME sector development is prominent in the strategy, and the subcommittee, \ncomprising relevant Government agencies and private sector representatives, is to formulate \nand  implement  a  more  detailed  framework  for  SME  development.    The  National  SME \nSubcommittee  is  one  of  three  subcommittees  established  under  the  Private  Sector \nDevelopment Steering Committee, the other two addressing (i) private sector development and \nparticipation in infrastructure, and (ii) trade facilitation.  \n \n13.  In addition, the Government recognizes that weak governance holds back private sector \ndevelopment by deterring investment, which, in turn, reduces opportunities for income and \nemployment growth. In 2001 the Government issued its Governance Action Plan, which is a \nstrategy to implement judicial and legal reforms, improve public administration and finance, and \ncombat  corruption.  This  is  complemented  by  the  recent  efforts  of  the  Public  Financial \nManagement Program (PFM). Under the PFM, the Government has committed to a series of \nreforms to not only enhance its fiscal management, but also promote good governance and \naccountability of the public sector. In addition, the PFM has many provisions for legal reform, \ninstitutional development, and capacity building, as well as civil service reforms to enhance \nimplementation at both central and local levels.  \n \n14.  The PFM is closely linked with ongoing reform of the legal system. Supported by eight \ndevelopment  agencies,  including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  Government  is \npreparing the short- and medium-term plan of action for legal and judicial reform. In addition to \nestablishing a modernized court system, the plan also aims to provide better information to the \npublic on various legal and governmental issues. Combined with the PFM and Governance \nAction  Plan,  and  as  reflected  in  the  Program  component  on  business  regulations,  the \nGovernment emphasizes the need to develop a more transparent and enabling governance \nstructure. Finally, as part of the requirements for entering the World Trade Organization (WTO), \nthe Government has agreed to reform the commercial legal framework to improve the business \nenvironment for SMEs and the private sector.  \n \n2.  Challenges \n \n15.  Many  enterprises  (and  particularly  smaller  enterprises)  still  face  major  barriers, \nparticularly the high costs of regulatory compliance, high level of informality, and limited access \nto key inputs and markets. The current shortcomings of the legal and regulatory environment \nnot only increase the cost of doing business, but also limit SMEs' access to key inputs for \ngrowth, such as finance. Although banking in Cambodia is still in the developing stages, it has \nexcess liquidity\u2014meaning that SMEs' limited access to finance is partially the result of the \ncurrently risky lending environment. While the high level of foreign investments during the late \n                                                 \n9 The Rectangular Strategy was announced by the Prime Minister during the first Cabinet meeting of the Third \nLegislature of the National Assembly at the Office of Council of Ministers (July 2004).   \n ", "  5 \n1990s has fuelled economic growth\u2014as indicated by the increasing number of medium-size \nenterprises\u2014the Government needs to formulate and implement a coordinated development \nstrategy aimed at fostering a more conducive business environment for SMEs. A discussion of \nsome of the major challenges follows. \n \na.  SME Development Framework  \n16.  Although  the  Government  recognizes  the  need  to  develop  a  supportive  regulatory \nenvironment,  it  lacks  a  coordinated  framework  to  implement  the  necessary  policy  actions. \nIndividual ministries continue to have their own, uncoordinated approaches to SME/business \ndevelopment. Little information exists on the industry structure, and few channels are available \nfor communicating and disseminating existing information.  \n \ni.  SME Development Policy \n17.  Only  limited  mechanisms  are  available  to  coordinate  development  of  a  cohesive \ngovernment-wide policy direction for SME development. The Rectangular Strategy is a broad \ndocument that requires a more in-depth, implementation framework. Without such a framework, \nany  approach  to  the  sector  will  not  identify  the  major  priorities  or  address  them  in  a \ncomprehensive, well-sequenced, and coordinated manner.  \n \nii.  Institutional Arrangements for SME Development \n18.  Even with adoption of an enabling SME development framework, considerable efforts \nare needed to ensure that it is effectively implemented. Implementation requires institutional \narrangements that facilitate a continuous flow of information to disseminate the framework's \nstrategic direction as well as monitor its progress and effectiveness. In particular, the following \nactions are needed: (i) collect information on the business sector (including SMEs) as a basis \nfor  a  more  effective  framework  evaluation,10 (ii)  make  information  available  to  SMEs  on \ngovernment regulations and programs, and (iii) expand opportunities for public participation in \npolicy formulation.  \n \nb.  Business Regulations \n19.  A major constraint to development of the private sector and particularly SMEs is the \nuncertainty  and  lack  of  transparency  in  the  current  regulatory  regime\u2014which  adds  to  the \nenterprises\u2019 costs of doing business. The Program emphasizes reform of regulations relating to \n(i) business registration, (ii) business operating licenses, and (iii) various regulatory licenses.11 \nAll enterprises are affected, but regulations regarding business registration would have the \ngreatest impact on medium-size firms, while business operating licenses are more important for \n                                                 \n10 One of the key practical barriers to the collection of information on the sector is the lack of the formal definition of \nSMEs. A definition needs to be established for the purpose of information and statistics collection by the National \nInstitute of Statistics and other relevant agencies.  \n11  These regulatory tools allow the Government to impact the market entry and operations of all enterprises. The \nmain differences among them should be clarified: in the case of business registration, certification allows the \nenterprises to become legal entities; in the case of business operating license, certification allows the enterprises \nto conduct their businesses in the specified industry; and finally, the regulatory licenses allow the Government to \nregulate enterprises on diverse issues to ensure that all relevant laws are complied with. Examples include labor \nsafety, sanitation, and environmental protection. Thus, a registered company would be required to adhere to both \noperating and regulatory license requirements; businesses with only operating licenses will also be required to \nadhere to regulatory licenses, but they are excluded from the formal tax regime.  \n ", "6  \nsmaller  enterprises.  Both  large  and  small  enterprises  are  heavily  impacted  by  the  various \nregulatory licenses.  \n \ni.  Business Registration System  \n20.  Although the decision to register12 should be at the discretion of each enterprise, the \ndifficulties  of  registering  have  important  implications.  Under  the  current  legal  framework, \nunregistered  enterprises  (i)  cannot  engage  in  foreign  trade;  (ii)  cannot  obtain  various  tax \nbenefits; (iii) cannot secure their assets in public registries, which are being developed in \nCambodia; (iv) cannot engage in legally protected commercial contracts in the name of the \nenterprise as a legal entity; (v) do not qualify for government procurement; (vi) have no legally \nprotected rights of shareholders; or (vii) cannot seek protection through corporate bankruptcy. In \naddition, although unregistered enterprises are not explicitly excluded, they are also likely to \nhave  difficulties  with  (i)  engaging  in  subcontracting  with  foreign  enterprises;  (ii)  validating \ncommercial contracts through the corporate entity; and (iii) obtaining loans from banks, which \nusually prefer to lend to registered companies. Finally, the barriers against registration also \ndiscourage enterprises from incorporating themselves as limited liability companies\u2014meaning \nthat the owners assume all the risks associated with the enterprise activities, as no legal \nseparation exists between the owner(s) and the enterprise.  \n \n21.  The  major  impediments  to  business  registration  are  as  follows.  First,  the  costs  of \nregistration are currently about $1,200 to $1,500 (four to five times per capita GDP) and the \nhighest in the Mekong region.13 Second, the approximately 17 processes and documentation \nrequirements involve various local and central government agencies.14 Third, enterprises must \nregister at the Ministry of Commerce (MOC) building in Phnom Penh. Entrepreneurs must \ntherefore travel to Phnom Penh, often several times, to register their enterprises. Fourth, the \nminimum  capital  requirement  for  business  registration  is  set  at  $5,000  (about  16  times \nCambodia's per capita GDP) and is higher than in neighboring countries. The requirement is \nbased solely on cash deposits at a commercial bank and, accordingly, takes no account of \nassets that a company may have. Finally, for the Government, lack of information technology \nprecludes an efficient registration system and effective storage of data.  \n \nii.  Business Operating and Regulatory Licensing System \n22.  Although most countries commonly have several agencies that issue specific business \nlicenses, Cambodia currently lacks a systematic approach to limit the burden on enterprises. On \naverage, Cambodian firms are subject to more than 16 license inspections per year. In addition, \nbusiness-operating licenses need to be renewed on a continual basis. The formal and informal \npayments for obtaining both operating and regulatory licenses add substantially to the cost of \ndoing business\u2014particularly for SMEs.  \n \n23.  The major challenges include the following. First, transparency is lacking in licensing \nprocedures, related costs, and requirements for inspection. This can lead to confusion and \nabuse by local officials. No information window is available to provide central access to such \ninformation. Second, without any criteria for analyzing whether the existing regulatory license \nrequirements  are  redundant,  no  mechanism  is  available  to  ensure  that  new  license \nrequirements do not duplicate existing ones, particularly as local and central agencies are \n                                                 \n12 Business registration refers to registration of various types of businesses as well as company incorporation. \n13  The average for the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand, and Viet Nam is about $120. \n14  In comparison, Viet Nam has six requirements. \n ", "  7 \nresponsible for their own licensing and inspection procedures, and coordination between central \nand  local  authorities  is  limited.  Third,  particularly  for  operating  licenses,  no  clear  criteria \nestablish a fair and effective process for issuance for various sectors. The agencies are able to \nimplement licensing and inspection procedures without any formal review of the necessity, \neconomic  impacts,  or  justification  of  the  regulations.  Some  agencies  and  officials  lack \naccountability, as licensing authorities are not required to justify their activities on the grounds of \npublic safety, health, or for quality assurance purposes. Finally, enterprises have no formal \nmechanism to request a reevaluation of the inspections, and thus may experience arbitrary \nlicense issuances/inspections.  \n \nc.  Access to Finance \n24.  As of the end of 2003, bank loans to the private sector were 6.9% of GDP\u2014one of the \nlowest rates of banking intermediation in the world. A study on SMEs by the Mekong Private \nSector Development Facility (MPDF) in November 2000 found that over 60% of respondents \nconsidered lack of working capital to be a major problem\u201470% of the firms needed long-term \nloans. A May 2003 MPDF study on bank financing for SMEs identified almost total absence of \nmedium- and long-term lending (less than 2% of SME loans were for more than 2 years).  \n \n25.  Several factors have resulted in this high risk-lending environment. One is the lack of \ncollateral and contract enforcement by the courts. This means that commercial banks must \nassume a considerable risk in lending to SMEs, which are usually less known and established \nthan  larger  businesses.  With  ADB  assistance,  the  Government  is  developing  a  legal  and \ninstitutional framework for secured transactions for movable properties. ADB and the World \nBank are also working with the Government on the Land Law and registration of land as \nimmovable properties. Furthermore, as part of the WTO accession requirement, a number of \ndevelopment  agencies  are  supporting  the  Government  with  contract  enforcement,  and \nestablishing and building the capacity of a commercial court. \n \n26.  Three important barriers block SME access to finance. The first is the lack of a credit \ninformation system, which heightens commercial banks' risks in lending. The second relates to \nthe  underdeveloped  accounting  and  taxation  systems,  which  deter  SMEs  from  providing \nsufficient financial information to the commercial banks. Finally, Cambodia has no nonbank \nfinancial institutions to provide finance to SMEs.  \n \ni.  Credit Information  \n27.  No system currently exists to collect credit information on borrowers in Cambodia. In \nmany developed financial systems, credit information bureaus provide information on potential \nborrowers, this helps reduce risks and transaction costs. Banks use collateral as one method to \nreduce this risk, but the effectiveness of this is constrained by SMEs\u2019 lack of significant assets, \nand by difficulties in securing their assets, particularly land/buildings. Although NBC and the \nAssociation of Banks in Cambodia (ABC) indicated a clear need to establish such a system, \nprogress has been limited.  \n \nii.  Accounting Standards and Taxation System \n28.  The high-risk lending environment is reinforced by the lack of financial statements for \nmost small enterprises; therefore lenders have difficulty obtaining an accurate picture of their \nfinancial position. Although the Government has made considerable progress with the recent \npromulgation  of  the  Accounting  Law  and  the  establishment  of  the  Cambodian  Accounting \n ", "8  \nStandards in 2003, the accounting system is overly complicated for use by SMEs. Without an \nunderstanding of accounting procedures, the SMEs are often unable to provide necessary and \nreliable information as required by the commercial banks. With the limitations many SMEs face \nin providing collateral for loans, this becomes a significant barrier. Furthermore, many of the \nissued accounting standards are not relevant to SMEs and their less complex financial situation. \nThus, a systematic approach is needed to disseminate information on the accounting system \nand train SMEs in its use (as well as providing SMEs with simplified guidelines and templates), \nfocusing  on  their  appropriate  needs.  Another  important barrier  associated  with the  lack  of \nfinancial information is the complexity of the current, formal tax system, which often provides \nverification on the financial statements of (larger) SMEs. Unfamiliarity with the filing system \nleads to uncertainty, which leads to increased costs for the SMEs (as about $500 is needed to \nhire a tax facilitator/accountant in Cambodia). While considerable efforts are currently ongoing \nwith the PFM Working Group (co-chaired by the International Monetary Fund and ADB), these \nefforts need to be complemented by reductions of the barriers faced by SMEs dealing with the \ntaxation system.  \n \niii.  Nonbanking Financial Institutions (Leasing) \n29.  Currently, the loans from commercial banks (and some lending by licensed microfinance \ninstitutions) are the only source of formal finance for SMEs, but these funds are generally short-\nterm (less than 1 year). Internationally, and particularly in developing countries, leasing has \nbecome an important source of SME financing, but the lack of a legal framework has been a \nmajor  obstacle  to  the  development  of  leasing  in  Cambodia.  For  SMEs,  leasing  offers  an \nalternative form of finance whereby a lessor relies on its ownership of the leased asset and the \nlessee's cash flow to service the lease payments. The benefits of leasing include simpler \nsecurity arrangements and fewer requirements for historical financial information. However, for \nleasing to develop, the lessor must be able to legally exercise ownership rights quickly and \neffectively when any default occurs. With the recent actions to develop the secured transactions \nand  commercial  court  system,  the  timing  would  be  appropriate  for  formulating  the  legal \nframework to create an enabling environment for leasing industry development. \n \n3.   ADB's Strategy and Operations in the Sector \n30.  ADB\u2019s  current  country  strategy  and  program  update  (2002\u20132004)  for  Cambodia \nreiterates the importance of achieving sustainable growth for realizing the overarching goal of \npoverty reduction.15 The strategic focus includes (i) fostering broad-based economic growth, (ii) \nreducing  vulnerability,  and  (iii)  strengthening  governance  for  development.  Private  sector \ndevelopment is recognized as one of the pillars to achieve the goal of economic growth, with an \nemphasis  on  governance  reforms.  Toward  this  end,  ADB\u2019s  ongoing  and  programmed \ninterventions  will  address  key  infrastructure  bottlenecks  to  growth,  human  resource \ndevelopment by promoting education and health, and financial sector development. In designing \nthe Program, governance reform, particularly for the business regulatory environment, and \ninstitutional arrangements needed for growth, ranging from an SME development framework to \na credit information system, have been emphasized.  \n \n31.  The Program has linkages with a number of current ADB projects. Most importantly, the \nProgram  components  to  enhance  access  to  finance  are  closely  linked  with  the  ongoing \nFinancial Sector Program Loan (FSPL).16 The FSPL has supported development of accounting \n                                                 \n15  ADB. 2002.

Manila (approved on November 2001 for $30 million). \n ", "  9 \nstandards,  establishment  of  the  bankers'  association,  and  establishment  of  the  secured \ntransactions system\u2014all of which are pertinent to the Program. In addition, the Financial Sector \nBlueprint\u2014a comprehensive 10-year development plan\u2014was prepared with ADB support and \nwas officially adopted by the Government in 2001. The Government is currently planning to \nupdate the blueprint. Financing for the FSPL is provided as a cluster loan, and although some \ndelays in implementation occurred due to the political situation in 2003\u20132004, the Government \nhas been able to undertake the FSPL's reforms without significant changes for the latter parts of \nthe  subprograms.  Currently,  with  the  second  of  three  subprograms  almost  completed,  the \nGovernment  has  made  substantial  progress  in  promoting  the  financial  sector,  including  (i) \nenhancing the bank supervision framework; (ii) establishing and engaging in capacity-building \nefforts of the bankers' association; and (iii) developing financial infrastructure, including secured \ntransactions system and uniform chart of accounts.  \n \n32.  The Program's efforts to promote good governance and effective decentralization (for \nbusiness registration) also aim to complement the ongoing and planned activities to support \npublic administration reform and capacity building of local government authorities.17 As much of \nthe Cambodian economy is rural-based, the Program is also linked with two agriculture/rural-\noriented projects. The Agriculture Sector Development Program Loan18 aims to improve access \nto productive resources and inputs through reform of the regulatory system, while the Rural \nCredit and Savings Project19 provided a credit line to microfinance institutions and supported the \nregulatory/licensing  scheme  of  those  institutions.  Through  the  components  on  business \nregulatory reform, the Program reinforces the aims of these projects to develop an enabling \nregulatory system for the private sector. Finally, the Program's support for the SME sector will \nprovide linkages to the planned activities to promote trade and investment in Cambodia and \nwithin the Greater Mekong Subregion.  \n \n4.  External Assistance to the Sector \n33.  Several other development activities are related to SMEs.20 ADB and the World Bank \nconducted studies to assess major issues facing the private sector in Cambodia. These studies \nfocused on the need for legal and regulatory reforms to improve the business environment and \nenhance  the  competitiveness  of  the  private  sector.  The  International  Finance  Corporation \nprovides the secretariat for the Private Sector Forum and facilitates meetings of the seven \nworking groups. Through this forum, the private sector has been given a stronger ability to voice \nits  concerns  about  the  business environment.  Other  development  support  has  focused  on \ndeveloping the legal framework for business. The Japan International Cooperation Agency has \nbeen involved in developing the commercial legal framework through its support to develop the \nCivil Code and Code of Civil Procedure.  \n \n34.  Other indirect support for the SME sector includes European Commission support to the \nrural sector, which focused mainly on agricultural production, but also carried out assessments \nof the agro-industrial situation, an area of great importance to Cambodian SMEs. The European \nCommission is also providing support for WTO accession in the areas of institutional support \nand trade facilitation and diversification. More direct support for SME development has come \nfrom United States Agency for International Development to fund programs to enhance the \n                                                 \n17 ADB. 2002.

The  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment has also provided assistance to build capacity of rice-millers associations and to \nsupport the diversification of seed varieties to improve the quality of milled rice as part of its \nAgriculture Quality Improvement Project. The Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit of \nGermany  provides  support  for  vocational  training  and  trade  promotion  to  support  the \ndevelopment of rural enterprises, and is currently planning its Private Sector Promotion Program \nfor Cambodia to commence in 2005. This program is likely to provide direct support to SMEs \nthrough  enterprise-centered  promotion  and  support  for  enterprise  networking.  The  United \nNations Industrial Development Organization is supporting MIME to develop industrial standards \nin product areas affecting Cambodian SMEs, particularly in agro-processing.  \n \n35.  MPDF is the main provider of direct support to SMEs in Cambodia. It provides financial, \nmarketing, and other related advice to SMEs; and capacity building to financial institutions to \nfacilitate  increased  financing  to  SMEs.  MPDF  also  provides  capacity  building  to  business \nassociations and management training to SMEs. Through its business enabling environment \nprogram, MPDF supports research on issues affecting SMEs, such as access to financing and \nin areas of governance and reform.   \n \n36.  Development agencies are in the process of providing or planning to provide a number \nof credit lines. Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement has a credit line of \u20ac3.8 million available \nuntil the end of 2004 for direct lending to microfinance institutions. Kreditanstalt Wiederaufbau of \nGermany initiated an SME financing project from the start of 2004, with a loan of \u20ac2.5 million to \nCanadia Bank. United States Agency for International Development is planning a $5 million \npartial credit guarantee scheme to Canadia Bank for loans to SMEs. Furthermore, Acleda Bank \nis seeking credit lines of $10 million in 2004 from offshore sources to fund increases in the loan \nportfolio.21 \n \n37.  To improve access to credit by providing funds, about 90 nongovernment organizations \n(NGOs) operate rural credit facilities. Most clients are poor households in rural areas. These \nNGOs provide loans to poor people of the same occupation or type of business. Loans are \nusually provided on a 6-month cycle and mostly used for activities related to agriculture and \nagro-based  businesses.  Loans  for  individuals  are  provided  based  on  the  borrowers\u2019 \nperformance  with  their  first-cycle  loans.  Smaller  credit  operating  NGOs  have  compulsory \nsavings requirements, where group members control their savings and use these savings for \nlending among themselves.   \n \n38.  In  sum,  the  Program  is  to  seek  synergy  with  the  Government  strategies  and \ndevelopment  activities  (most  of  which  are  recently  formulated),  especially  those  related  to \ndevelopment of a legal and regulatory environment, including the necessary institutions. The \nProgram also aims to complement current projects aiming to provide financial resources to \nSMEs  and  micro-enterprises.  Accordingly,  many  of  the  alternative  assistance  modalities, \nespecially credit lines for SMEs, have not been included in the Program to avoid overlap with \nother development agency (and NGO) activities. \n \n5.  Lessons Learned \n39.  A number of important lessons can be learned from ADB's past operations in SME \ndevelopment. The following lessons are particularly relevant for Cambodia:  \n \n                                                 \n21  Acleda Bank is a microfinance institution which has been increasing its lending to micro- and small-enterprises. \n ", "  11 \n(i)  For  program  loans,  the  commitment  of  the  developing  member  country \ngovernment is crucial for successful outcomes. Specific attention also needs to \nbe  paid  to  implementation  aspects  of  program  loans.  Accordingly,  capacity-\nbuilding measures through TA and regular dialogue remain critical.  \n \n(ii)  Programs need to develop close linkage and synergy with other related projects \nto have a more sustainable effect. Because the SME sector represents much of \nthe private sector in many developing member countries, one program/project \nwill have difficulty undertaking all the necessary reforms.  \n \n40.  Distinct features of the Program include the consultative approach taken throughout its \nformulation. A series of workshops was organized for each component with a view to achieve \nthe commitment of Government and stakeholders. An advisory TA will be provided for capacity \nbuilding and support for program implementation. Furthermore, the Program is designed to \nmaximize linkage with projects from ADB and other development agencies.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED PROGRAM \nA.  Objective and Scope \n41.  The overall objective of the Program is to lay the foundation for development of a \nbusiness environment conducive to sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction. This \nobjective will be achieved by (i) establishing an SME development framework, (ii) implementing \nreforms of governance and business regulations; and (iii) improving SME access to finance. The \nProgram\u2019s emphasis on the need to reduce the costs of doing business can be achieved with \nclose coordination among key Government agencies. To facilitate the coordination process, an \ninter-ministerial coordination body will be established to lay the foundation for the Government's \nstrategy on SME development. The Program also includes several policy actions to improve \nSMEs' access to finance\u2014mostly aiming to reduce risks associated with the current lending \nenvironment. \n \n42.  Developing an enabling business environment is particularly relevant for Cambodia, \nwhere significant institutional and legislative components are missing or poorly developed, and \nSMEs operate mostly in the informal sector. The components, both legal and institutional, \nessential for an efficient economy need to be established. Through the analysis of the program \npreparatory TA, and based on dialogue with the Government and other stakeholders, the issues \nselected for support under the Program were determined by (i) their contribution to improving \nthe  business  environment;  (ii)  the  perceived  commitment  of  the  Government  to  required \nreforms;  (iii)  ADB's  past  and  ongoing  operations  in  Cambodia;  and  (iv)  the  Program\u2019s \ncomplementarities with other development agency activities. \n \nB.  Policy Framework and Actions \n43.  The overall policy framework and specific policy actions include the following: \n \n(i)  The policy framework and actions will aim to foster a more coordinated approach \nto  enterprise  (and  particularly  SME)  development  by  the  Government.  This \nincludes  (a)  establishing  a  National  SME  Subcommittee  (according  to  the \nRectangular  Strategy)  with  a  permanent  secretariat;  (b)  adopting  and \nimplementing an SME development framework\u2014intended as a midterm, inter-\nministerial  policy  agenda  to  support  SMEs,  with  developing  an  enabling \n ", "12  \nenvironment as the priority; and (c) developing institutions to ensure increased \nflow of information to businesses in particular SMEs, and to seek closer public-\nprivate partnership.  \n \n(ii)  A set of measures for reducing the costs of doing business will enhance the \nGovernment's transparency and governance. Components include (a) directly \nreducing the costs and removing unnecessary requirements for both business \nregistration and business operating and regulatory licenses; (b) installing a one-\nstop information system that provides information on relevant regulations for \nSMEs, as well as a recourse mechanism to track and resolve complaints on \nregulations  from  enterprises;  and  (c)  promoting  effective  decentralization \ncombined with enhanced accountability of Government agencies.  \n \n(iii)  Several actions will improve SME access to finance, including the development \nof  (a)  a  credit  information  system  to  reduce the  transaction  costs  and  risks \nassociated  with  SME  lending;  (b)  SME  accounting  guidelines,  including  a \nsimplified  taxation  filing  system,  to  help  SMEs  maintain  and  provide  better \nfinancial  information;  and  (c)  a  legal  framework  to  provide  the  basis  for \nestablishing a leasing industry in Cambodia.  \n \nThese measures are intended to reduce the costs and risks associated with doing business in \nCambodia. Reforms to be supported by the Program are presented in the policy matrix in \nAppendix 4. The development policy letter is in Appendix 5 and the sector strategy in Appendix \n6. A detailed discussion follows.  \n  \n1.  Establish a Coordinated Approach to SME Development  \n44.  The Program includes the formulation of an SME development framework, and the \nestablishment of an effective inter-ministerial coordination body (National SME Subcommittee). \nThe framework provides a 6-year policy agenda on SME development, and establishes the \nGovernment's primary policy direction as developing an enabling business environment, to be \nimplemented by various agencies. Provisions will also be developed to promote public-private \npartnership, including the promotion of business associations. The National SME Subcommittee \nwill  coordinate  framework  activities.  The  committee\u2019s  establishment  marks  the  first  inter-\nministerial body in Cambodia to formulate and implement a set of policies on the SME sector.   \n \na.  Formulate the SME Development Framework \n45.  The  main  focus  of  the  SME  development  framework  will  be  developing  a  market-\noriented  business  environment;  it  aims  to  be  a  conduit  for  policy  coordination  among \nGovernment  agencies.  Several  ministries  are  concerned  with  ensuring  SMEs  conform  to \nregulatory requirements, while others are more directly concerned with promoting the welfare of \nworkers and small-scale entrepreneurs. Such diverse interests across many ministries have led \nto  a  variety  of  approaches,  initiatives,  and  regulations  dealing  with  SMEs.  Until  now,  the \nGovernment  has  made  little  effort  to  coordinate  or  develop  a  strategic  approach  for  SME \ndevelopment. The great variety of efforts by various ministries has meant, at best, a lack of a \ncoordinated effort for developing SMEs; at worst, it has resulted in conflicting signals to small-\nscale entrepreneurs and an increase in uncertainty. \n \n46.  The framework, to be formulated by the National SME Subcommittee and approved by \nthe Council of Ministers, will provide a sequenced set of specific policy goals to be achieved, as \n ", "  13 \nwell as identify the relevant Government agencies. The timetable for the framework is expected \nto be 6 years, with a review and evaluation to be initiated in the third year. Often, such broad \nplans  fail  to  materialize  due  to  limited  opportunities  for  impartial  review  of  progress.  The \nsequencing of the policy reforms as identified in the framework needs to be regularly adjusted \nbased on implementation capacity, as well as to accommodate unexpected changes in the \noverall macroeconomic environment. Where necessary, the framework will identify and plan for \ninstitutional  structures  and  capacity  building  within  the  Government  to  ensure  effective \nimplementation.   \n   \nb.  Develop Institutional Arrangements for the Framework \n47.  With a primary objective to provide support for effective framework implementation, this \nactivity  has  several  components.  First,  the  Government  has  recently  announced  the \nestablishment of a National SME Subcommittee, with responsibility for coordinating and policy \nformulation  for  SMEs.  The  subcommittee  will  have  high-level  representation  from  all  key \nagencies with significant interests related to SMEs, including the Ministry of Women's Affairs to \nensure that the framework is gender-responsive, as well as private sector representation. The \nsubcommittee is expected to be chaired by the MIME Minister. MIME will provide the secretariat.   \n \n48.  To formulate, implement, and evaluate a comprehensive SME development framework, \nthe Government needs to collect more comprehensive information on enterprises \u2013 which in \nturn lead to the publication of the annual SME sector report by the MIME on behalf of the \nsubcommittee.  The report is to cover: (i) status of the SME sector, (ii) the Government's \nachievements in implementing the SME development framework, and (iii) goals for the coming \nyear.  It will be made available to the public, via posting on the MIME website, and will also be \nsubmitted to the Council of Ministers and the National Assembly.  As part of this process, \nagreement will be reached on an official definition of SMEs. To ensure gender responsiveness, \ndata  collection  will  include  disaggregated  data  on  gender.  The  Government  is  to  develop \nmechanisms to gather more accurate information, and also provide information to entrepreneurs. \nThis is a critical element, especially for evaluation and planning for the next sequence of the \nframework.  The  Government  will  establish  a  website  for  SMEs,  to  provide  information  on \nvarious  government  regulations  and  market  information,  including  a  list  of  business \nassociations.22  \n \n2.  Enhance Governance and Business Regulations \n49.  The Program includes several reforms to enhance public governance and business \nregulations. First, is reform of the business registration system. The reforms entail reducing \ncosts  and  procedures/requirements,  enhancing  transparency,  and  decentralizing.  Second, \nspecific measures to improve the current operating and regulatory licensing systems include \nidentifying and removing unnecessary licenses (and licensing requirements), developing criteria \nfor issuance of any new license requirements, and implementing mechanisms for enterprises to \nstate their grievances pertaining to administrative decisions concerning licensing and inspection. \nEnhanced transparency and accountability of Government agencies are critical for the success \nof these reforms, and related to the ongoing governance reforms. \n \n                                                 \n22 In recognition that Internet access is low in Cambodia, the Government will also draft a plan for enhancing \ncoverage of information access for SMEs.  \n ", "14  \na.  Improve the Business Registration Process \n50.  The main objective is to reduce the barriers and enhance the transparency associated \nwith business registration. The proposed reform aims to induce a more developed commercial \nsystem by allowing enterprises to enter the formal sector and, in the case of incorporation, \nestablish legal entities as companies and protect the rights of the shareholders.  \n \n51.  MOC  will  undertake  several  components  for  registration  reform.  First,  the  Program \nincludes activities to reduce registration procedures and documentation requirements of both \ncentral and local governments. This is intended to make the Cambodian system consistent with \ninternational  experience.  As  specified  in  the  policy  matrix,  about  half  of  the  registration \nrequirements are to be removed as a result of the proposed reform. Second, the Program aims \nto reduce the costs associated with registration. Based on the reduction of the current costs \n(mostly by removing unnecessary requirements), barriers against business registration will be \nsignificantly reduced. Third, the Program includes the development of a pilot program that will \npermit provincial registration. Procedures to effectively implement this decentralization plan, \nwhich will be compatible with the provisions of the (draft) Law on Commercial Enterprises, will \nbe developed. Fourth, the Government is to decrease the minimum capital requirement for \nnewly registering enterprises. The current $5,000 requirement will be reduced to $1,000 by \namending the (draft) Commercial Enterprise Law, which is soon to be promulgated by the \nNational Assembly.23 Fifth, the Program includes the introduction of an information technology-\nbased registration system. Enhanced transparency will result when the various procedures and \nrequirements  are  clarified  through  the  issuance  of  new  legal  documents.  An  effective \ninformation technology-based system should lead to eventual decentralization of the system.  \n \nb.  Develop a Transparent Business Licensing System \n52.  The main objective in business licensing reform is to reduce the costs of doing business \nin  Cambodia,  specifically  the  regulatory  compliance  costs.  Although  the  Government  must \nmaintain  an  effective  licensing/inspection  system,  it  should  not  be  overly  burdensome  for \nenterprises. Thus, the Program seeks to streamline current licensing (by eliminating duplicative \nlicenses and/or their requirements) and ensure that new licenses to be required will not be \nredundant. Furthermore, enterprises should be given the right to ask for clarification on the \nprocess of licensing and inspections.  \n \n53.  To achieve this task, forming an inter-ministerial body will be important, as various \nministries and agencies have different licensing jurisdictions. Accordingly, the National SME \nSubcommittee  will  review  licenses  and  inspection  procedures  affecting  SMEs  and  make \nrecommendations for reforms to the Council of Ministers. As a first step, the subcommittee will \ninitiate the reform by identifying all major licenses (and their legal authorization) of the major line \nministries affecting SMEs.24 Then, it will develop criteria on current licenses to streamline the \nlicensing process and requirements deemed to be unnecessary or overly burdensome. The \nsubcommittee will also develop a set of criteria for any new operating and regulatory licenses. \nThe overall aim is to ensure consistency and accountability among all agencies authorized to \nissue licenses.  \n \n                                                 \n23 As an interim measure, MOC issued Announcement No. 1962 MoC/M2004 on the Requirement for Minimum \nDeposit in the Bank for Registered Companies (August 2004), which reduces the amount to KR4 million. \n24 The relevant agencies include the ministries of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; commerce; economy and \nfinance; environment; industry, mines, and energy; and tourism. \n ", "  15 \n54.  To  improve  the  rights  of  businesses  to  file  grievances  against  officials  unfairly \nimplementing laws and regulations, a plan will be adopted for a recourse mechanism that (i) \nprovides a window for the private sector to report grievances regarding administrative decisions, \n(ii)  establishes  a  system  for  investigating  grievances,  and  (iii)  provides  a  mechanism  for \nresolving complaints. Accordingly, the National SME Subcommittee will oversee implementation \nof the plan to establish a recourse mechanism (which also tracks the records of complaints by \nenterprises). Finally, the subcommittee will establish a one-stop information window to provide \nenterprises with necessary information and guidelines for compliance with all relevant business \nlicenses. As both regulatory and operating licenses are largely decentralized, a high level of \ninconsistency arises from various authorities. Full information is not provided to SMEs, and thus \na centralized, one-stop information window will facilitate the licensing process by providing \nSMEs with both information and guidelines.  \n \n3.  Enhance SME Access to Finance \n55.  The Program's components on finance are closely linked with the ongoing FSPL. The \nFSPL aims to promote the development of a sound, market-based financial system to support \nenhanced resource mobilization and sustainable economic growth by establishing a foundation \nfor banking, as well as financial market development. The challenge associated with SMEs' \naccess to finance cannot be solely resolved by financial sector development, as one of the key \nbarriers relates to developing a viable group of SMEs as potential borrowers. In fact, the recent \nsuccess of Acleda Bank in Cambodia indicates that the financial sector can provide effective \nmeans of financing to SMEs. Thus, the aim of the Program is to foster SME sector development \nand complement efforts of the FSPL to enhance SME access to finance.   \n \n56.  Accordingly, the Program emphasizes institutional development of needed infrastructure \nto reduce the risks and costs of lending to SMEs, including (i) developing a credit information \nsharing system to help reduce the risks faced by banks in lending to SMEs; (ii) formulating \nsimplified accounting guidelines that are more relevant to the needs of smaller enterprises, but \nmeet  the  requirements  of  potential  lenders  for  information  on  enterprises;  (iii)  formulating \nsimplified  guidelines  and  standard  forms  for  the  tax  filing  system;  and  (iv)  developing  a \nframework for leasing as a potential source of longer term financing. The work on leasing is \nsupported by the FSPL's efforts to establish a secured transactions system.  \n \na.  Develop a Credit Information System \n57.  The main objective is to reduce the risks of commercial banks in their lending activities. \nA long-term goal associated with this is to develop non-collateral-based lending. Cambodia \ndoes not have a public/private credit information registry, and as a consequence, transaction \ncosts for lenders remain high. \n  \n58.  The  components  for  this  activity  include  the  following:  First,  NBC,  with  ABC,  is  to \ndevelop a credit information system on a pilot basis, with the eventual goal of establishing a \nprivate  credit  bureau  when  the  market  is  more  developed.  Participation  by  banks  will  be \nvoluntary. A database will be established to receive and provide credit information. Information \nwill be collected from participating banks, and disclosed to the same banks, i.e., a reciprocal \nsystem. The system's database protects the identity of existing lenders by not disclosing the \nname of the bank providing the information (i.e., name of lender). The database is to be updated \nmonthly from information provided by participants. Participants have access to the database. \nSuitable security arrangements must be developed to maintain the integrity of the system and to \nensure that participating banks do not relay incorrect information.  \n ", "16  \n \n59.  Second, to enable the pilot credit information system, a legal framework that protects the \nrights of both participating banks and borrowers is needed. NBC will need to take a proactive \nrole in ensuring that the information system will not be abused (i.e., exchange of inappropriate \ninformation). Accordingly, NBC is to issue the necessary legal and regulatory framework in this \nregard, as well as oversee overall implementation and regulate the system as mandated in the \ncurrent  legal  framework.  Finally,  NBC  and  ABC  are  to  formulate  a  plan  with  the  goal  of \nexpanding the pilot credit information system, given the maturity and expansion of the market \nfor credit information. One possibility is to invite a foreign credit bureau to establish a joint \nventure with local institutions.  \n \nb.  Assist SMEs on the Accounting and Taxation Systems \n60.  The  main  objective  is  to  help  the  SMEs  effectively  utilize  the  current  accounting \nstandards of Cambodia. First, a simplified financial reporting system will be developed. The \nNational  Accounting  Council  recognizes  the  necessity  for  developing  simplified  financial \nreporting standards or guidelines. The intent is not to develop a separate accounting standard, \nbut to design simplified guidelines based on the relevant current accounting standards so that \nSMEs can improve (i) access to finance, and (ii) financial management of their business.  \n \n61.  To develop SME guidelines for financial reporting, based on Cambodian Accounting \nStandards, MEF will form an SME accounting task force, with National Accounting Council and \nprivate sector representatives, to develop a set of accounting (financial reporting) guidelines for \nSMEs.  To  promote  effective  use  of  the  SME  accounting  guidelines,  MEF  and  National \nAccounting Council will jointly implement training programs with materials for SMEs.  \n \n62.  Complementing the reforms as related to the accounting system, the Program also \nincludes reform of the current taxation system, based on the recent efforts of the Technical \nCooperation and Assistance Program and ongoing efforts of the PFM. MEF is to develop a \nmore appropriate tax filing system that is not overly complicated for the use of most enterprises. \nMost  enterprises  are  not  aware  of  the  intricacies  of  the  taxation  system;  this  heightens \nuncertainty and thus costs. This problem is also one of the main reasons why a vast majority of \nenterprises are not willing to register, as they will be subject to the formal taxation system. The \noverall aim is to develop a more transparent and fair tax filing system, thereby reduce SME \ncosts and encouraging them to enter the formal regime.25  \n \nc.  Develop a Legal Framework for Leasing \n63.  The main objective is to develop an enabling legal framework for a leasing industry to \nfacilitate an inflow of bank and nonbank finance to SMEs. The lack of a legal framework \ndiscourages financial institutions (mostly commercial banks\u2014both domestic and foreign-owned) \nfrom engaging in leasing.26 The Program identifies the formulation of the legal framework as the \nkey  priority  for  developing  a  leasing  industry  in  Cambodia.  The  framework  must  be \n                                                 \n25 The reform of the taxation system complements a more holistic approach currently being undertaken by the PFM, \nwhich continues the recent assistance from the Technical Cooperation and Assistance Program sponsored by \nADB, Department for International Development, International Monetary Fund, and United Nations Development \nProgramme. Through the program, the Tax Department received TA to develop tax policy and strengthen tax \nadministration. Profit taxes in the real regime system are based on self-assessment filings by the taxpayer followed \nby auditing by the Tax Department. \n26 This analysis is confirmed by another conducted by the International Finance Corporation in 2002, which also \nstated that the lack of the legal framework on leasing is considered as the most significant barrier.  \n ", "  17 \ncomplemented by a supportive taxation regime for financial leases. With the recent efforts to \ndevelop  the  secured  transactions  system  and  commercial  court  system,  initiation  of  the \ndevelopment of leasing in Cambodia is timely.  \n \n64.  Components include the following. First, the NBC is to draft an enabling law for finance \nand operating leases so that, over time, the relevant financial institutions can offer these new \nfinancing products to SMEs to provide them with medium- and long-term finance.27 Both banks \nand non-banks will be allowed to engage in leasing. Second, to enable finance leasing, MEF, in \nconsultation with NBC, is to make the necessary changes to the taxation laws and regulations to \nenable financial leases and to remove the present discrimination in the tax law that imposes \nwithholding tax on financial lease payments, but not on loan interest payments. The relevant \nGovernment agencies are to draft implementing guidelines on leasing.  \n \nC.  Important Features \n65.  In  an  economy  where  the  business  environment  remains  highly  uncertain,  lacks \ntransparency and recourse for a predictable and fair legal system, investments tend to be \ndiscouraged. On the other hand, an efficient market economy with a highly transparent and \npredictable set of market-based rules that are enforceable through an efficient legal system will \nencourage investment and economic transactions to take place. Enterprises will have incentives \nto outsource to SMEs through subcontracting or other arrangements.  \n \n66.  The Program will have an impact on SMEs by creating a more predictable and efficient \nbusiness environment. This will result from (i) coordination and a more strategic direction for \nSME development, (ii) greater transparency in the reduced regulatory requirements, and (iii) \nimproved access to finance. The establishment of the National SME Subcommittee and the \nSME development framework should help ensure a coordinated approach to SME development. \nFurthermore,  the  Program  will  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  time  and  money.  By \nsimplifying  and  computerizing  the  business  registration  process,  it  will  encourage  more \nenterprises to enter the formal sector. The benefits include increased access to government \nservices, greater recourse to and protection under the legal system, and enhanced access to \nfinance. The Program will enhance access to finance through a greater range of financial \nproducts such as leasing, and through better information systems such as a credit information-\nsharing mechanism, allowing financial institutions to make more informed decisions. Better \ninformation systems reduce risks and will reduce the cost of finance.  \n \n67.  In recognizing the importance of addressing women\u2019s specific needs and constraints in \nprivate sector development, the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs will be included as a member of the \nNational SME Subcommittee. In light of the Government\u2019s commitment to ensure the visibility of \nwomen  entrepreneurs  and  their  contribution  to  the  policy-drafting  and  decision-making \nprocesses, the drafting of the SME development framework will be based on a gender-inclusive \nparticipatory process. This process will imply a systematic consultation with key line ministries \nand private sector representatives, relying upon the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs\u2019 outreach and \nnetwork with women\u2019s entrepreneurs and business associations. In addition, to gather more \naccurate information on the SME sector and to better reflect women entrepreneurs\u2019 contribution \n                                                 \n27 Two types of lease should be distinguished. Financial leasing defined in International Accounting Standard 17 (IAS-\n17) as a transaction where one party, the lessor, owns the asset and leases it to another party; and the lessee, for \na term that in essence covers all or most of the useful life of the asset. IAS-17 considers a finance lease to be a \nfinancial transaction. Operating leasing is the more generally understood form of lease (rental), where the lease \nterm is shorter, does not cover the useful life of the asset, and the asset returns to the lessor at the end of each \nlease.  \n ", "18  \nto private sector development, the National Institute of Statistics, Ministry of Planning, will \nensure that data collected on SMEs are also gender-disaggregated. The summary poverty \nreduction and social strategy is in Appendix 7. \n \nD.  Financing Plan \n68.  The Government has requested a loan of $20 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources. The loan will have a 24-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, an \ninterest charge at the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum \nthereafter, and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance with those \nset forth in the draft Loan Agreement, The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons \nfor its decision to borrow from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources on the basis of these terms and \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. The loan will be released in three \ntranches. \n \n69.  The total loan amount for the Program is determined on the basis of the strategic \nimportance of developing the SME sector and the costs of structural reforms to be supported \nunder the Program. Such costs arising from reform measures to be implemented under the \nProgram are estimated to be around $25 million to $30 million equivalent during the 36 months \nplanned for program implementation.28 In addition to the Program loan, counterpart funding will \nbe utilized for the remainder of the costs associated with the reforms. Streamlined tax filing, \nlicensing, and business registration procedures are expected to reduce fees by $5 million to $8 \nmillion per year. Equipment, software, and hardware for establishing systems to support a \nstreamlined  and  efficient  business  registration  system  will  incur  costs  of  approximately  $4 \nmillion. Training, including local and district training, is estimated to total $4 million per year. \nHowever,  the  costs  associated  with  the  reforms  are  expected  to  be  compensated  by  an \nincrease in Government revenue in the long term. For example, as the costs of registration \ndecreases, more enterprises are expected to register, and thus increase revenue. \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n1.  Period of Implementation  \n70.  The period for implementation of the proposed program will be 36 months from loan \neffectiveness. The first tranche will be released upon loan effectiveness,29 the second tranche \nwill be released approximately 18 months after loan effectiveness, and the third tranche is \nexpected  to  be  released  within  36  months  of  loan  effectiveness,  assuming  the  applicable \ntranche release conditions are met. \n \n2.  Program Management \n71.  MIME will be the Executing Agency (as well as chair the National SME Subcommittee \nand provide the subcommittee's secretariat). MIME will be responsible, either as the Executing \nAgency or as the secretariat, for production of required reports; website support and expansion; \nlicensing reform; and development and implementation of the SME development framework, \none-stop  information  window,  and  the  recourse  mechanism.  To  coordinate  program \nimplementation among Government ministries and agencies concerned, a program steering \n                                                 \n28 Estimates by ADB staff with inputs from the project preparatory TA consultants (footnote 7). \n29  This assumes all 1st tranche conditions have been met by the date of effectiveness.  \n ", "  19 \ncommittee (PSC) will be formed. The PSC, chaired by the minister of MIME, will comprise \nsenior officers from all implementing agencies concerned (MEF, MOC, Ministry of Planning, and \nNBC). The PSC will meet at least twice yearly to review pending issues and propose concrete \nactions for their resolution to ensure timely program implementation. A program implementation \nand coordination unit will be formed within MIME, headed by a senior officer of MIME, to help \nthe PSC and ADB implement the Program. The unit will be staffed by MIME officials with \nsufficient knowledge and capacity to assist the PSC and ADB. The unit will be responsible for \nday-to-day implementation of the Program.  \n \n3.  Procurement and Disbursement \n72.  For  the  ADB  loan,  in  accordance  with  the  simplified  disbursement  procedures  and \nrelated requirements for program loans, all procurement of goods and services produced in and \noriginating from ADB member countries will be made with due consideration to economy and \nefficiency, in accordance with standard public procedures in Cambodia and normal private \nsector commercial practices acceptable to ADB. Goods commonly traded on the international \ncommodity markets will be procured in accordance with procedures appropriate to the trade and \nacceptable to ADB. \n \n73.  The loan proceeds will be disbursed for a broad range of imports, subject to a negative \nlist of ineligible items (Appendix 8). The Government will certify that the value of total imports \nminus (i) imports from nonmember countries, (ii) ineligible imports, and (iii) disbursements made \nunder  other  official  development  assistance,  is  greater  than  the  amount  expected  to  be \ndisbursed during the year. ADB will have the right to audit the use of the loan proceeds and to \nverify the accuracy of the Government's certification. \n \n4.  Counterpart Funds \n74.  The Government has provided assurances that sufficient funds will be made available to \nmeet the costs associated with the reform program supported under the Program, including, (i) \nallocations to cover expenses relating to dissemination of regulatory information through print or \nother mass media or the Internet; (ii) institutional capacity building to plan, design, and enforce \nSME development; and (iii) support for specific program measures.  \n \n5.  Monitoring and Tranching \na.  Monitoring \n75.  The Government and ADB will continue to engage in active policy dialogue on sector \nissues, policy reforms, and other measures during program implementation and on additional \nreforms that may be considered necessary or desirable. \n \n76.  The Government will provide ADB with semiannual reports on program implementation, \nand  on  the  accomplishment  of  the  Program's  objectives.  The  consolidated  reports  will  be \nsubmitted in such form as ADB may reasonably request, and will include (i) progress made and \nspecific problems encountered during the 6 months under review, (ii) steps taken or proposed to \nbe taken to resolve the problems, and (iii) proposed program activities and expected progress \nduring the following 6 months. ADB will send regular review missions to confirm compliance with \nconditions for the second and third tranche releases, and advise on actions to maintain program \nimplementation on course. The Government will prepare and provide ADB with a consolidated \n ", "20  \nprogram completion report on the overall impact of the policy reforms implemented within 3 \nmonths from completion of the proposed program.  \n \nb.  Tranching \n77.  The loan will be released in three tranches subject to the Government meeting the \napplicable tranche release conditions. The first tranche of $7 million equivalent is expected to be \nreleased upon loan effectiveness, the second tranche of $8 million equivalent approximately 18 \nmonths after loan effectiveness, and the third tranche of $5 million equivalent is expected within \n36 months of loan effectiveness.  \n \nV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n78.  The TA aims to support the implementation of various policy and institutional reform \nmeasures to support SME development\u2014as specified in the Program\u2014as well as provide key \ninstitutional capacity-building support to the implementing agencies. The main activities of the \nTA will include (i) technical support to the Government in its efforts to undertake the reforms; (ii) \ncapacity building support to the Government through workshops, roundtable discussions, and \nformal/informal  discussions;  and  (iii)  support  for  consensus  building  and  information \ndissemination through a series of workshops and other related events. \n \n79.  The TA will be cofinanced by ADB and the Government of Denmark. ADB will provide \n$500,000 on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program; the Government of Denmark will \nprovide $350,000 on a grant basis. The Government of Cambodia will finance the remaining \n$150,000 equivalent of the local currency costs, including provision of counterpart staff, office \nspace,  administrative  services,  and  physical  facilities.  The  ADB  grant  will cover  the  entire \nforeign exchange costs and part of the local currency cost. Inception of the TA is scheduled for \n2005,  with  implementation  over  8  months.  A  total  of  26  person-months  of  international \nconsulting services and 32 person-months of domestic consulting services will be required. \nConsultants will be recruited in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB. Procurement under the TA will be in accordance \nwith  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement.  The  objectives,  scope,  and  implementation \narrangements, including the budget of the TA, are in Appendix 9. \n \n80.  Given the extensive need for TA for implementing the Program, provision of additional \nassistance to the implementing agencies will be considered, pending availability of TA funds, \nboth within ADB and from other development agencies. Priority will be given to: (i) capacity \nbuilding activities of the implementing agencies, assessed as not being sufficiently covered \nunder the attached TA, and (ii) technical support to achieve compliance with policy actions for \nrelease of the third tranche of the loan. A succeeding TA is currently in the pipeline for $500,000 \nin 2006. Confirmation of the TA will take place during the country-programming mission in 2005.   \n \nVI.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \nA.  Benefits and Impacts \n81.  The Program\u2019s impact on SMEs will be the creation of a more predictable and efficient \nbusiness environment. This will occur through (i) coordination and a more strategic direction in \ngovernment  SME  development;  (ii)  reduction  of  and  greater  transparency  in,  regulatory \nrequirements; and (iii) improved access to finance.  \n \n ", "  21 \n82.  Greater coordination and strategic direction in SME policy is expected to result in better \ncoordination between ministries and a more consistent market friendly approach in dealing with \nSMEs. It will also result in government programs taking onboard the lessons learned in SME \ndevelopment, and applying best practice to programs and government interventions in the SME \nsector.  The  Program  will  also  reduce  the  cost  of  doing  business  in  time  and  money.  By \nsimplifying  and  computerizing  the  business  registration  process,  it  will  encourage  more \nenterprises to enter the formal sector. Benefits to entering the formal sector include access to \ngovernment services; recourse to, and protection under the legal system; and enhanced access \nto finance. Finally, the Program will enhance access to finance, by increasing the range of \nfinancial  products  such  as  leasing,  and  improving  information  systems  such  as  a  credit \ninformation  sharing  mechanism.  Financial  institutions  will  be  able  to  make  more  informed \ndecisions; thus leading to reduced cost of financing.  \n \n83.  The  successful  implementation  of  the  Program  will  incrementally  improve  the \nenvironment for doing business, leading to greater economic activity and more employment, \nwhich will have a catalytic impact on the development of the private sector.  \n \nB.  Risks and Safeguards \n84.  Successful implementation of the Program entails three risks. The first relates to a low \nlevel of capacity within the Government to implement some of the complex reforms. In previous \nprograms, delays were caused predominantly by lack of technical expertise. To address this risk, \nTA  is  being  provided  to  support  Program  implementation,  and  provide  capacity-building \nactivities (in coordination with other development agencies).  \n \n85.  A second risk relates to lack of coordination among various Government agencies. The \nProgram requires close coordination among the relevant authorities\u2014both horizontally among \ndifferent  ministries  and  agencies  concerned,  and  vertically  with  the  provincial  and  district \nauthorities. Consultation and coordination will be required with other stakeholders active in SME \ndevelopment.  The  Program  design  has  taken  this  risk  into  consideration  and  emphasizes \ninteragency  coordination  mechanisms,  particularly  by  establishing  an  inter-ministerial \ncoordination body (National SME Subcommittee) with private sector participation. \n \n86.  A third risk relates to good governance of the central and local government authorities. \nLocal governance is particularly important, as the Program's most direct impact on SMEs will be \nat the local level. These risks, common to several programs, are being addressed by the \nGovernment's PFM, supported by a number of development agencies, including ADB.  \n \n87.  Overall,  the  environmental  implications  of  the  Program  loan  were  reviewed  and  no \nsignificant adverse impact was identified. The loan is classified as category C under ADB's \nenvironmental classification system. A review of license issuance and inspection procedures of \nthe  Ministry  of  Environment  and  other  major  ministries  will  be  supported  under  the  loan. \nInstituting  streamlined  and  coherent  rules  and  procedures  among  regulatory  agencies  is \nexpected  to  contribute  to  promoting  transparency,  accountability,  and  effectiveness  among \nregulatory agencies, as well as stricter compliance to environmental standards among SMEs. \n \n ", "22  \nVII.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n88.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and MIME have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents:  \n(i)   The policies adopted and actions taken before the date of the Loan Agreement \nas described in the development policy letter will continue to be in effect for the \nduration of the Program period and subsequently.  \n(ii)   The  Government  will  promptly  adopt  such  policies  and  take  other  actions \nincluded in the Program and specified in the development policy letter, and will \nensure that such policies and actions continue to be in effect for the duration of \nthe Program and subsequently. \nB.  Conditions for Loan Effectiveness \n89.  The conditions for loan effectiveness are the following:  \n \n(i)  the  Government  will  form  a  PSC,  chaired  by  the  minister  of  MIME,  and \ncomprising senior officers from MEF, MOC, Ministry of Planning, and NBC; and  \n \n(ii)   MIME will establish a program implementation and coordination unit, responsible \nfor day-to-day program implementation, headed by a senior officer of MIME and \nstaffed  with  MIME  officials  (subject  to  acceptability  by  ADB)  with  sufficient \nknowledge and capacity to assist the PSC and meet the requirements of ADB. \n \nC.  Conditions for Disbursement \n90.  The disbursement of the three tranches is subject to fulfillment of specified first, second, \nand third tranche release conditions as set out in the policy matrix. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n91.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB and recommend that the Board approve the loan in various currencies equivalent to \nSpecial Drawing Rights 13,344,000 to the Kingdom of Cambodia for the Small and Medium \nEnterprise Development Program, from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources, with an interest charge \nat the rate of 1.0% per annum during the grace period and 1.5% per annum thereafter; a term of \n24 years, including a grace period of 8 years; and such other terms and conditions as are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \n18 November 2004                      \n                      Tadao Chino \nPresident \n ", "  Appendix 1  23 \nPROGRAM FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance Indicators/  Monitoring \nDesign Summary  Assumptions and Risks \nTargets  Mechanisms \nGoal       \n  Increased gross domestic  Economic reports and   \nEconomic growth  product (GDP)  official statistics of the \nbased on private    Government, and private \nsector development  Increased trades  sector organizations, and \nIncreased number of private  international development \nenterprises  agencies \n   \nReduced unemployment   Asian Development Bank \n  (ADB) staff assessments \nReduced incidence of poverty \nPurpose       \n  Increased share of SMEs\u2019 GDP   Economic reports and  Assumptions \nImprove business    official statistics of the  Overall macroeconomic \nenvironment, which  Increased number of established  Government, private  stability  \nwill be important  SMEs   sector organizations, and   \nparticularly in    international development  Political commitment and \nimproving  Increased contribution of  agencies  coordination to undertake \nopportunities for the  employment from SMEs to total    reforms at both central and \ndevelopment of  employment in the country  Official, legal documents  local government levels  \nsmall and medium  issued by the Government   \nenterprises (SMEs).

General Overview \n1.  Cambodian  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  operate  almost  entirely  in  the \ninformal sector. In the agriculture sector, most small enterprises operate on an informal basis \nwithout any form of registration or taxation. The formal agriculture subsector includes only the \nenterprises holding Government concessions. The nonfarm subsector operates both informally \nand formally. Microenterprises operate largely informally without permits or licenses and do not \npay profit tax. Small enterprises, while often licensed to operate by the Ministry of Commerce \n(MOC) and other relevant ministries at the provincial-municipal level, normally do not pay profit \ntaxes  and  are  regulated  informally  by  local  authorities.  Nonlicensed  enterprises  are  often \nsubject to paying small-scale unofficial fees to local authorities.  \n \n Table A2.1: Classification of Labor Force and Gross Domestic Product \n by Formal/Informal Sector \n \n  Labor Force   GDP  \nSector  (000's)  ($ million) \n  2000  2001  2000  2001 \nTotal  5,430  5,630  3,149  3,234 \nFormal a  260  275  596  660 \nGarment  200  210  363  407 \nTourism  60  65  233  253 \nInformal  5,170  5,355  2,552  2,573 \nAgriculture  4,196  4,352  928  919 \nIndustry b  217  224  426  421 \nServices c  757  779  1,198  1,233 \nGDP = gross domestic product \na Because of lack of information, the data does not include companies in the food and tobacco \nindustry, communications, wholesale, and finance that provide formal jobs.  \nb Mostly includes handicraft and small factories.  \nc Mostly includes trade, transportation, and other informal services. \nSource: Cambodian Development Resource Institute, compiled from government primary data and \ninstitute surveys. \n \n2.  Table A2.1 provides an estimate of the contribution of the formal and informal sectors in \nthe economy. According to Cambodian Development Resource Institute estimates, 95% of all \nemployment is provided by the informal sector, while 80% of the gross domestic product is \ninformal. The foreign sector plays a large role in the formal sector. Approximately 90% of the \nemployees of the garment sector are working in foreign-owned companies. The tourism sector \nis also heavily foreign owned with approximately two thirds of all approved capital investment \ncoming from abroad.  \n \nB.  Subsector Profiles \n3.  Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. According to Cambodian Development Resource \nInstitute estimates that by far the largest share of domestic private employment (77% of the \nlabor  force)  is  employed  in  informal  agriculture  (Table  A2.2).  Most  rural  households  are \nengaged in some form of agriculture, especially rice paddy production, mainly for home use and \ntrade. Rice production has grown at an average annual rate of 2.8% from 1995 to 2001.1 \n                                                 \n1  The Royal Government of Cambodia. 2001. Cambodia Statistical Yearbook 2001. Phnom Penh. ", "    Appendix 2          31 \nAccording to various estimates, between 4 million and 4.4 million people derive the majority of \ntheir income from agriculture;2 the majority are smallholders. Poverty levels in this area are high. \nApproximately 75% of the poor live in households headed by farmers. Productivity of agriculture \nis low in terms of labor (about $166/worker) and in terms of land ($480/ha).3 While total output \nhas been increasing, the per capita area of cultivation has decreased significantly since 1995 \nfrom 0.82 hectares per worker to 0.77 hectares (2001).4 As the population grows, the demand \nfor land increases, resulting in reduced farm size, migration from rural to urban areas, and an \nincrease in landless people.  \n \nTable A2.2: Rice Production, Cultivation, and Employment Trends \n \nItem  1995  1996  1997  1998  1999  2000  2001 \nOutput ('000 tons)  3,447.8  3,404.0 3,414.9 3,509.9 4,029.6  4,049.9  4,026.1\nArea Cultivated  \n2,086.0  2,153.0 2,076.0 2,094.7 2,157.6  2,318.5  2,240.9\n('000 ha) \nEmployment ('000)  2,533.0  2,620.0 2,691.0 2,754.0 2,813.0  2,850.0  2,901.0\nOutput/Employment \n1.361  1.299 1.269 1.274 1.432  1.421  1.388\n(tons) \nArea Cultivated/ \n0.824  0.822 0.771 0.761 0.767  0.814  0.772\nEmployment (ha) \nha =  hectares. \nSource:  The  Royal  Government  of  Cambodia.  2002.

Employment, income, and subsistence from fisheries are particularly important to rural \nhouseholds where few alternative employment opportunities exist. According to the Ministry of \nAgriculture,  Forestry,  and  Fisheries,  approximately  465,000  people  are  employed,  deriving \nseasonal incomes or subsisting on the fishery and other aquatic resources.5 Most fishery activity \nis in the informal sector. The ministry estimates that 84% of all labor in the fishery subsector is \ninvolved in family fishing. Family fishers are small scale (1\u20133 persons), who fish primarily for \nfamily subsistence. They pay no fees to the Department of Fisheries and are permitted to catch \nfish throughout the year in areas outside fishing reserves and fishing lots, which currently \naccount for approximately 56% of all fisheries in the country.  \n \n5.  The formal agriculture subsector covers enterprises with land concessions. Agriculture \nconcessions have been awarded to 25 companies with total land area of 723,000 hectares, of \nwhich only 82,000 hectares (11.3%) have been cultivated. Agriculture concessions account for \nonly 3.6% of all cultivated land area in Cambodia. \n \n6.  Enterprises with forest concessions make up the formal forestry subsector. Currently, \n3.9 million hectares, or about 37% of forested land, have been given as concessions to 14 \nlogging companies. The Government has revoked the licenses of 15 companies operating on 22 \nforest sites covering a total area of slightly more than 3 million hectares as part of its policy to \n                                                 \n2  The Labor Force Survey of Cambodia, 2001, estimates that 4.07 million people work in the agriculture sector while \nthe Cambodian Development Resource Institute figure is 4.35 million.  \n3  ADB. 2002.

Activity in the forestry sector has come to a \nhalt with the banning of exports of logs in 2000 and the cutting of trees on concession land in \n2001. Logging operations on forest concession land are suspended until concession holders \nsubmit forest management plans that are approved by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and \nFisheries.  \n \n7.  The informal forestry subsector is mainly community forestry, which currently covers \n71,724 hectares, less than 0.7% of total forest area (footnote 3). Although this management \nmodel may expand in the future, several constraints to its development are related to the \nclarification of property rights in forest areas, the demarcation between different types of forest \nand  agricultural  land,  and  the  social  cohesion  of  communities.  The  isolation  of  the  forest \ncommunities  makes  monitoring  difficult,  and  the  lack  of  adequate  institutional  capacity  to \nsupport the communities with training and resources for reforestation and maintenance of forest \nresources is a major constraint. \n \n8.  Trade  and  Services.  In  2002,  MOC  issued  a  prakas  (No.  078  MOC/M2002)  on \nprocedures for monitoring activities related to trade services and commerce requiring small \nenterprises not registered under the Law on Commercial Rules and Registration to obtain a \nlicense  to  operate  commercial  activities  and  services  through  MOC\u2019s  provincial-municipal \ndepartments.  Through  this  process,  MOC  licensed  30,752  enterprises.  However,  many \nenterprises  remain  unlicensed  by  MOC,  obtaining  operating  permits  from  other  relevant \nministries instead. MOC estimates that 21,268 of these enterprises are food processors, while \n5,634 are manufacturers, 4,811 are service providers, and 729 are in forestry and fisheries. \nMOC  is  unable  to  provide  a  detailed  breakdown  by  industry  or  comprehensive  data  on \nemployment and output of these locally licensed enterprises. Such information would be very \nuseful to policymakers to better understand the informal sector, which comprises such a large \nportion of Cambodia\u2019s economic activity and employment.   \n \n9.  Manufacturing. MIME carries out an annual survey of industrial enterprises through its \nprovincial-municipal  departments.  As  seen  in  Table  A2.3,  food,  beverage,  and  tobacco \nmanufacturers represent the largest number of the industrial establishments.  \n \nTable A2.3: Industrial Establishments by International Standard Industrial Classification \n(ISIC) \n \n1999  2000  2001  2002 \nISIC \nISIC  No.   Share  No.  Share  No.  Share  No.  Share \nCode \n(%)  (%)    (%)    (%) \n         \nTotal \n3  24,227   100.00  25,406  100.00   27,155  100.00  26,920  100.00 \nManufacturing \n3.1  Manufacture of \n  food, beverage,  19,147   79.03  20,152  79.32  21,871  80.54  21,568  80.11 \n  and tobacco \n3.2  Textile and \n396   1.63  366  1.44  1,382  5.09  1,417  5.26 \n  wearing apparel \n3.3  Wood and wood \n814   3.35  869  3.42  141  0.52  13  0.05 \n  products \n3.4  Paper and \n23   0.10  24  0.09  23  0.08  15  0.06 \n  paper products \n3.5  Chemical, \n  rubber, and  67   0.28  297  1.17  277  1.02  275  1.02 \n  plastic products ", "    Appendix 2          33 \n3.6  Nonmetallic \n777   3.21  666  2.62  721  2.66  757  2.82 \n  mineral products \n3.7  Manufacture of \n24   0.10  108  0.43  -  0.00  -  0.00 \n  basic metals \n3.8  Fabricated \n1,623   6.70  1,716  6.75  1,454  5.35  1,899  7.05 \n  metal products \n3.9  Other \n  manufacturing  1,356   5.60  1,208  4.75  1,286  4.74  976  3.63 \n  industries \nSource: The Government of Cambodia.2001. Cambodia Statistical Yearbook 2001. Phnom Penh; and Ministry of \nIndustry, Mines, and Energy. \n \n10.  Formal.  Registered  private  enterprises  constitute  what  is  referred  to  as  the  formal \nprivate sector. As of the end of 2002, 9,265 enterprises were registered with MOC. These \nenterprises  comprise  7,586  limited  companies,  1,513  sole  proprietors,  197  representative \noffices, 69 branch offices, and 677 dissolved enterprises.6 MOC does not sort this data by \nsector or industry so obtaining an accurate picture of the makeup of the establishments is not \npossible.  The  commercial  registration  is  required  only  for  enterprises  meeting  the  Tax \nDepartment\u2019s  annual  turnover  threshold  for  entering  the  real  regime.  Although  it  is  not \nmentioned  in  the  Law  on  Commercial  Rules  and  Registration,  registered  enterprises  are \nrequired to pay profit tax according to the real regime method, meaning they must file regular \nincome statements and pay the 1% advanced profit tax every month. These enterprises are also \nsubject to value-added tax. Only about 2,000 companies are estimated to have tax codes.  \n \n11.   Geographic Distribution of SMEs. No national data are available on the geographic \ndistribution of SMEs. In 2001, MIME conducted a survey of small enterprises operating in the \nmanufacturing  sector.  The  largest  cities  for  manufacturing  SMEs  include  Kampong  Cham, \nKampong Thom, and Prey Veng (Table A2.4).  \n \nTable A2.4: Geographic Distribution of Small and Medium Enterprises \n \nNumber   Number  \nProvinces/City  Labor  Provinces/City  Labor \nof Firms  of Firms \n    Female  Total      Female  Total \n1 Banteay  \n   Meanchey  508   103  1,379  13 Preah Vihear  311   \u2013\u2013  \u2013\u2013 \n2 Battambang  803   204  4,308  14 Prey Veng  2,827   2,752  5,462 \n3 Kampong  \n   Cham  3,039   3,179  10,264  15 Pursat  1,590   1,509  3,495 \n4 Kampong   \n   Chhnang  977   51  1,036  16 Rattanakiri  89   \u2013\u2013  \u2013\u2013 \n5 Kampong   \n   Speu  1,442   9,339  23,344  17 Siem Reap  1,228   738  2,828 \n6 Kampong  \n   Thom  3,061   2,287  4,879  18 Sihanouk Ville  117   157  805 \n7 Kampot  1,772   1,956  5,775  19 Stung Treng  127   73  310 \n8 Kandal  2,117   1,798  6,385  20 Svay Rieng  1,247   1,224  2,630 \n9 Koh Kong  88   39  272  21 Takeo  1,393   1,415  2,922 \n10 Kratie  1,410   1,702  4,399  22 Odormeanchey  6   6  29 \n11 Mondol Kiri  76   3  168  23 Kep  183   267  632 \n12 Phnom Penh  1,562   4,514  10,664  24 Pailin  12   \u2013\u2013  68 \nTotal  25,985   33,316  92,054         \n\u2013\u2013 = no available data \nSource: Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy. 2001, Survey of Small Industries.

Small and microenterprises are an important \nsource of employment for women. Based on the survey of over 25,000 firms, about one third of \nemployees are women\u2014further indicating the importance of women workers in Cambodia.  The \nbreakdowns of male and female workers by industry groups show that a majority of the women \nare engaged in the informal sector. In addition to agriculture and fisheries, women are engaged \nin unskilled and semiskilled, low-paid economic activities such as craft and related trade/retail \noccupations.  \n ", " \nDEVELOPMENT COORDINATION MATRIX \nAid  Partner  Completion \nNo.   Project Title  Main Activities  Budget  Start Date \nAgency  Agencies  Date \nIdentify issues affecting the private \nPrivate Sector Assessment  sector and make recommendations for   $150,000  MIME  Mar 2003  Dec 2003 \nenhancing private sector development. \nCreate an enabling legal and regulatory \nSME Loan (planned)  $15 million  MIME  2005  2007 \nenvironment for SME development. \nPreparing SME Sector  Prepare SME loan project (technical \n$0.5 million  MIME   Feb 2004  Jul 2004  \nDevelopment Program  assistance [TA]). \nPreventing Poverty and  Conduct comprehensive situation \n1  ADB  Empowering Female Garment  analysis of the garment industry and the \nWorkers Affected by the  impact of phasing out the MFA quota  $0.5 million  MOC   June 2003 Dec 2004 \nChanging International Trade  restrictions on textiles and clothing at the \nEnvironment  end of 2004. \nTA for Sustainable  Formulate the Micro- and Small-\nEmployment Promotion for  Enterprise Development Policy for  $0.4 million  MWA  Oct 2002  Sep 2004 \nPoor Women  MWA\u2019s Strategic Plan (2005-2010). \nSupport for Supreme National  Provide adviser to SNEC to help develop \n  MEF  Ongoing   \nEconomic Council (SNEC)  a Government economic strategy. \nMain objectives include: including (i) \nenhancing the bank supervision \nframework; (ii) establishing and  MEF / \nFinancial Sector Program  engaging in capacity-building efforts of  National \n    $30 million  2001  Ongoing \nLoan  the bankers' association; and (iii)  Bank of \ndeveloping financial infrastructure,  Cambodia\nincluding secured transactions system \nand uniform chart of accounts \nA\nProvides a credit line to microfinance  MEF /  p\np\nRural Credit and Savings  institutions and supported the  Rural  e\n    $20 million  2000  Ongoing  n\nProject  regulatory/licensing scheme of those  Developm dix\ninstitutions  ent Bank   3\n \n  Support three MFIs: Seilanithih, Hatha \nMicrofinance institutions (MFI) \n2  AFD  Kaksekar, and Ennatien Moulethan  \u20ac3.8 million     1995  2004 \nAssistance \nTchonnebat (EMT).  3\n5\nProvide financial support through grant  Artisans   \nArtisans d'Angkor  to the Government, who in turn, lends to  \u20ac700,000   d'Angkor  2001  2004 \nArtisans d'Angkor. \nContinued on next page \n ", " \nAid  Partner  Completion  3\nNo.   Project Title  Main Activities  Budget  Start Date  6\nAgency  Agencies  Date   \n    Provide medium term financing in local \nEMT  \u20ac3 million    2004  2006 \ncurrency.

In Cambodia, SMEs dominate the economy \nand are a major source of employment for the poor. The Program is expected to increase SMEs\u2019 contribution to \neconomic growth, employment generation, and poverty reduction. Through creating a more conducive business \nenvironment by coordinating the Government\u2019s SME strategies, minimizing regulatory requirements, and enhancing \naccess to finance, Program in the medium- to long-term will have significant impact on SMEs, increase opportunities \nfor employment, and reduce the incidence of poverty in urban areas. To the extent possible, the Program will ensure \nthat the process of SME policy drafting, validation, and implementation follow the Government\u2019s stated goal to foster \nparticipation, and promote social inclusion and gender-responsiveness in pursuing its poverty reduction efforts. A \nsignificant proportion of SMEs are found in the rural area. Extending the outreach and impact of the proposed \ninterventions beyond the densely populated cities of Phnom Penh, Sianoukville, Siem Reap, and Battambang is a \ncritical risk. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis \n \nIn the National Poverty Reduction Strategy (2003\u20132005), a number of investment studies identified the following \nissues as barriers to private sector development and micro- and SME development: poor physical infrastructure, high \ncosts of transportation, electricity and telecommunications, safety and respect of signed contracts, limited human \nresources,  increasing labor  costs, high transactions costs, and the  lack of proper legal and judicial systems. \nCambodia\u2019s Poverty Partnership Agreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) further reiterates the critical areas \nof ADB support, which include developing the financial sector, following the Financial Sector Blueprint, and supporting \nreforms of the legal infrastructure for business. In line with the priorities set forth in the National Poverty Reduction \nStrategy and Poverty Partnership Agreement, the Program aims to address some of the structural policy and \nlegal/regulatory impediments to PSD and micro- and SME development. Identified priorities include the following: \n \n\u2022  Coordination and a more strategic direction in SME development. Greater coordination and strategic direction in \nSME policy is expected to result in better coordination between ministries and a more consistent market-friendly \napproach in dealing with SMEs. It will also result in Government programs taking on board the lessons learned \nin SME development and applying best practice to program and Government interventions in the SME sector. \n \n\u2022  Reduction and greater transparency in the regulatory requirements. The Program will reduce the costs of doing \nbusiness. By simplifying and computerizing the business registration process, it will encourage more enterprises \nto enter the formal sector, thus benefiting from access to Government services, recourse to and protection \nunder the legal system, and enhanced access to finance. In the agro-industry sector, where informality and poor \ninfrastructures are critical, the Program is expected to have significant benefits, by improving entry into the \nformal sector through registration reform, licensing review process, and improved inspections system. The \nportal site will assist in availability of information and improve value chains, an essential component for a \ncompetitive market. \n \n\u2022  Improved access to finance. Finally, the Program will enhance access to finance, through a greater range of \nfinancial products such as leasing, and through better information systems such as a credit information sharing \nmechanisms allowing financial institutions to make more informed decisions. Better information systems reduce \nrisks and assuming all else is equal, will reduce the cost of finance. The successful implementation of the \nProgram will incrementally improve the environment for doing business, leading to greater economic activity and \nmore employment, which will have a catalytic impact of PSD in Cambodia. \n ", "      Appendix 7  59 \n \n \nReforming the licensing, registration, accounting, and inspection processes for micro- and SMEs is likely to erode the \nvested interests of those perpetuating illegal and corruptive business practices. The establishment of transparent, \nmarket-friendly, socially inclusive and\u2014to the extent possible\u2014gender-responsive business practices is also likely to \npromote private sector confidence and contribute to the establishment of pro-poor governance structures. \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nStakeholder Analysis                                                               No \n \nDuring project design, no formal stakeholder analysis was conducted. However, the formulation of the Program is \nbased on extensive formal and informal stakeholder consultations. Agreement on the Program components comes \nfrom in-depth analysis and extensive discussions. These discussions started with ADB\u2019s Private Sector Assessment in \n2003 in collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders, which were part of the consultative group for the Private \nSector Assessment, and included: Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy; Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry \nof Commerce, Council for the Development of Cambodia, National Bank of Cambodia, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry \nand Fishery, Ministry of Tourism, Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs, the Chamber of Commerce of Cambodia, the World \nBank, the International Finance Corporation, the Mekong Project Development Facility, several bilateral development \nagencies,  25  enterprises,  major  nongovernment  organizations,  business  associations,  legal  professionals,  and \nconsultants. This support continued under the project preparatory technical assistance from February to August 2004. \nIn particular, policy measures proposed under the Program have been discussed extensively with Government \ndepartments and officials directly concerned with each issue in terms of policy development and at the technical and \ndecision-making levels. To assist with implementation, technical inputs have been provided from experts in the fields \nof SME policy, registration systems, licensing review process, simplified accounting standards, and credit information \nsystems. The discussions resulted in agreement with the Government on the objective and scope of the Program. \nFinal  technical  discussions  with  a  broad  range  of  Government  and  PSD  stakeholders  (including  women \nentrepreneurs) were held during the consultation workshop for the Program on 29 July 2004. \n \nParticipation strategy                                                               No \n \nD.      Gender Development \n \nStrategy to Maximize impacts on Women \n \nIn light of the critical importance to voice women\u2019s specific needs and constraints in PSD and SME enterprise \ndevelopment, the Ministry of Women\u2019s Affairs will be integrated as a full member of the national SME subcommittee, \nwhich will be established to design the SME development framework. This may be done prior to the release of the 1st \ntranche, if a revision of the draft subdecree currently submitted for approval to the Prime Minister is feasible, or, in any \nevent, prior to the release of the 2nd tranche. In light of the Government\u2019s commitment to ensure the visibility of \nwomen  entrepreneurs  and  their  contribution  to  the  policy-drafting  and  decision-making  processes,  the  SME \ndevelopment framework will be drafted based on an iterative and gender-inclusive consultative process. This process \nwill imply a systematic consultation with key line ministries, private sector representatives, relying upon the Ministry of \nWomen\u2019s Affairs\u2019 extensive outreach and network with business associations and women\u2019s entrepreneurs. \n \nData and information on SMEs are scarce and unreliable in Cambodia, and present formidable challenges in \nbenchmarking the social impact of the proposed interventions. To gather more accurate information on the SME \nsector and to better reflect women\u2019s and women\u2019s entrepreneurs\u2019 contribution to private sector and SME development, \nthe  National  Institute  of  Statistics,  Ministry  of  Planning,  will  ensure  that  data  collected  on  SME  are  gender-\ndisaggregated. This will provide the Government with a better basis to formulate gender-responsive policy and \ninterventions. In this respect, the finalization of ADB-funded micro- and small-enterprises development framework for \nthe  Ministry  of  Women\u2019s  Affairs\u2019  Strategic  Plan  [TA-3947-CAM]  will  contribute  to  defining  specific  needs  and \nconstraints faced by women\u2019s entrepreneurs and women-run businesses, and define a strategy for more concerted \nand targeted Government and development agency interventions. \n \nOutput Prepared                                                                   No \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "60  Appendix 7 \n \n \nE.
