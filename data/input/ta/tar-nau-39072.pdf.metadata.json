Rightsizing and restructuring of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been identified as \npriority areas in the reform process. Following a request from the Government for technical \nassistance (TA) to support SOE reform, an Asian Development Bank (ADB) fact-finding mission \nvisited  Nauru  from  24  March  to  1 April  2005  and  reached  an  understanding  with  the \nGovernment on the impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost, financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.1 The design and monitoring framework is \npresented in Appendix 1. \n  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The economy of Nauru has been deteriorating since the late 1980s as the country\u2019s \nsingle export commodity, phosphate, experienced falling export prices and lower production \nlevels. During the last decade, the economy has deteriorated to a situation of economic crisis \nbecause of mismanagement of public funds. A complete collapse of the economy is being \naverted by activities associated with Nauru\u2019s agreement with Australia to host asylum seekers \nand by international aid. Gross national per capita income is estimated to have dropped from \nUS$2,000 in 2004 to about US$5002 in 2005.  \n \n3.  A new and reformist Government was elected in October 2004 with a far greater majority \nthan previous governments.3 A politically stable environment is required for sustaining needed \nbut painful reforms that will affect all economic activity in Nauru. The new Government has \ninherited an economy in deep crisis together with an unaffordable and severely mismanaged \npublic sector and a considerable public debt. The public sector, including the SOEs, is too large \nand inefficient to sustain services to the population of about 12,000 people. The Government \nhas embarked on a process to reduce fiscal expenditure to within the means of the economic \nsituation in Nauru. Salaries alone make up more than 50% of expenditure. The main immediate \nchallenge facing the Government is the adverse impacts on the families of employees and the \neffects on economic activity that will result from rightsizing the overstaffed public sector.  \n \n4.  Nauru\u2019s economy is dominated by 12 SOEs, which together employ about 2,000 people. \nThe  Nauru  Phosphate  Corporation  (NPC)  is  the  largest  employer  with  about  1,500  staff. \nRightsizing the SOEs will be associated with adverse social impacts as most households in \nNauru are dependent on public sector wages with few options for alternative income sources. \nThe management of the SOEs is weak and daily operations are subject to severe political \ninterference. The Government is reviewing the highly politicized appointment process of the \nboards of directors of SOEs.  \n \n5.  Most  of  the  SOEs  have  commercial  operations,  while  a  few  are  structured  as \nnoncommercial statutory corporations or trusts. Maintenance of capital equipment is nearly \nnonexistent except from ad hoc emergency repairs. The account status of most of the SOEs is \ndeplorable.  The  boards  have  never  been  made  accountable  for  performance.  With  a  few \nexceptions, financial statements have not been produced for almost a decade. Most of the \nSOEs are incurring operating losses and their suspected net asset position has been negative \n                                                 \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 11 April 2005. \n2  ADB staff estimates based on public sector salaries, employment, economic activity, and household size. \n3  The new Government has the confidence of having 16 out of 18 parliamentary seats. \n ", "2   \nfor years. Because of complexities of cross-borrowing and lending, it is difficult to assess the net \nfinancial position. The capacity of the Government to reconstruct the accounts of the SOEs is \nalso constrained, with only one qualified accountant remaining in the country.  \n \n6.  The Government has identified the restructuring of NPC as an urgent priority in the \nreform process. NPC\u2019s main operations include mining, power, water, and port activities. The \ncurrent  size  and  structure  of  NPC,  inherited  from  the  era  of  phosphate  mining,  are \nunsustainable. The heavily oversized labor force lack motivation, particularly since they have \nnot been paid in over 6 months. Management sees its primary role in phosphate mining with \nlittle incentive to provide water and power utility services. The reform of NPC will need to start \nwith an understanding of its financial position, including assets and liabilities, and the state of its \ncurrent infrastructure. The most recent independent audit of NPC was conducted in 2001, which \nraised concerns over receivables, doubtful debts, and evaluation of assets. The audit was \nunable to express an opinion on whether the accounts were prepared in accordance with \ninternational accounting principles. \n  \n7.   The  poor  quality  of  electricity  and  water  services  in  Nauru  is  of  concern  to  the \nGovernment. Over the last 18 months, about A$16 million in assistance from the Australian \nAgency for International Development (AusAID) has been allocated to the power sector. Despite \ndisbursements  of  about  A$8  million  for  fuel,  water  shortages  are  frequent  and  electricity \nservices are often only provided for a few hours a day. This situation is largely caused by poor \nmanagement,  inadequate  maintenance,  and  low  revenue  collection.  The  largest  defaulters \ninclude government agencies and SOEs. The situation is made worse by a practice of allowing \npublic sector employees to pay electricity and water bills with Bank of Nauru checks to offset \noverdue public sector salaries. This has resulted in NPC being unable to raise the cash needed \nto meet fuel expenses.   \n \n8.   Given the size of the economy of Nauru and the history of poor governance, potential \nprivate investors are likely to view the country as high risk. Options for privatizing water and \nelectricity services may be meager, short-term, and require high returns to cover risk. The \ncountry also lacks the capacity to regulate and monitor a private sector monopoly. The culture of \nnonpayment of electricity bills is an additional risk for private sector investors. But it is evident \nthat Nauru lacks the capacity to ensure the provision of water and electricity services to the \npeople  of  Nauru  and  that  private  sector  participation  in  the  management  of  the  utility  is \nessential.  \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The TA will help the Government in the restructuring of NPC by advising on viable \ninstitutional, technical, and financial options for providing water and electricity services to the \npeople of Nauru. The TA will: (i) provide the Government with options for public-private sector \nparticipation for a reformed and independent water and power utility to improve performance, \n(ii) examine a transparent and explicit subsidy mechanism, (iii) provide a time-bound plan for \nphasing out subsidies over time, and (iv) provide technical options to address the low revenue \ncollection.  It  is  expected  that  the  reform  of  NPC  and  private  sector  participation  in  the \nindependent water and power utility will provide an example for restructuring the other SOEs \nwith commercial operations. \n ", "  3\nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The TA will consist of two phases. The first phase will include a diagnostic of the \nactivities and business structure of NPC, including an assessment of its performance. The \noutputs of the first phase will include: (i) statements of NPC\u2019s financial position, including assets \nand liabilities and the current state of its infrastructure; (ii) assessment of NPC\u2019s business \nprocedures and practices and reporting arrangements to the Government; and (iii) assessment \nof management and staff capacity and skills. On the basis of the outputs of the first phase, the \nTA will recommend appropriate restructuring of NPC\u2019s businesses.  \n \n11.  The second phase will focus on the operations of water and electricity services for \nNauru. The TA will assess the viable institutional, technical, and financial options for private \nsector participation in the delivery of water and electricity services. This will include options for \nprivate sector management of the utility operations or a joint venture with the private sector. The \nTA will also examine contractual arrangements needed to manage risk, service obligations, and \ntariffs for each of the proposed options. The TA will also advise the Government on steps to be \ntaken to embark on an international bidding procedure and contractual arrangements, including \noptions for bidding for least-cost subsidies needed to regulate tariffs and service obligations. \nThe outputs of the second phase will include: (i) recommendations for least-cost investment \nappropriate to serve unconstrained demand for water and power in Nauru; (ii) assessment of \nstaffing and skill requirements for an independent water and power utility; (iii) preparation of a \nfinancial management model and projections; (iv) assessment of options for private sector \nparticipation;  and  (v)  assessment  of  a  transparent  subsidy  mechanism  and  subsidy \nrequirements,  including  time-bound  plans  for  the  phasing-out  of  subsidies  and  funding \narrangements. The second phase will also examine options such as prepay meters to eliminate \nthe risk of nonpayment of electricity bills. \n \n12.  The TA will also help the Government in preparing a strategy for public consultation for \ndisseminating  information  of  the  independent  water  and  power  utility,  including  tariffs  and \nrevenue collection. Implementing a public dissemination strategy is needed to address the \nculture of nonpayment of electricity bills. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at US$470,000 equivalent, comprising US$366,000 \nin  foreign  exchange  and  US$104,000  equivalent  in  local  currency.  The  Government  has \nrequested ADB to finance US$375,000, comprising the entire foreign exchange cost and a \nportion of the local currency cost amounting to US$9,000 equivalent, to be financed on a grant \nbasis from the Government of Australia and administered by ADB. The Government will finance \nthe remaining US$95,000 equivalent of local currency costs through in-kind contributions of the \nexecuting  and  implementing  agencies.  Government  counterpart  funds  will  cover  costs \nassociated with office accommodation and facilities, local communication and transport, and \ncounterpart staff. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will be the Executing Agency and has assigned NPC as \nthe implementing agency. NPC has agreed to assign counterpart staff in accounting, and in \npower and water systems planning. In order for NPC to be able to provide adequate finance and \naccounting  counterparts,  the  Government  and  NPC  have  agreed  to  reengage  the  former \naccountant  of  NPC  by  1  July  2005  and  assign  him  as  a  counterpart  for  the  financial \n ", "4   \nmanagement  specialist.  MOF  and  the  management  of  NPC  will  liaise  closely  with  the \nconsultants, make available relevant information, and facilitate the collection of financial and \ntechnical data needed for the implementation of the TA.  \n \n15.  A firm will be engaged to provide about 9.5 person-months of international consulting \nservices. The team of international consultants will consist of an SOE restructuring specialist \n(team leader, 4 person-months), a financial management specialist (3.5 person-months), and a \npower system planner and engineer (2 person-months). The firm will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with the Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. The firm will be recruited using \nquality- and cost-based selection procedures; biodata technical proposals will be requested. \nThe outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. \n \n16.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  with  intermittent  consultancy  services  over  a  7-month \nperiod, commencing in August 2005 with expected completion in March 2006. Implementation \nof the TA will be monitored by ADB TA review missions and regular communications with MOF \nand the team of international consultants. Reporting arrangements will include submission of: (i) \nan inception report within 4 weeks of commencement of services; (ii) an interim report within 2 \nmonths of the fielding of the consultants, which will be discussed during a tripartite meeting with \nthe Government and ADB; and (iii) a draft final report to be discussed during a second tripartite \nmeeting with the Government and ADB. The final report, incorporating the comments of the \nGovernment and ADB, will be submitted within 4 weeks of the second tripartite meeting. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n17.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  US$375,000  to  the \nGovernment of Nauru to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Australia for the \nReform of the Nauru Phosphate Corporation, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved electricity  Reduced load  Utility records and data  \u2022  Sustained Government \nand water services to  shedding  on load shedding and  commitment to reforms \nthe people of Nauru    sales \nIncreased water \nproduction \nOutcome      Assumptions \nA reformed and  Adequate financing  Government decision  \u2022  Private sector \nindependent water  of water and power    participation \nand power utility with  utilities  Government budget and  \u2022  Government \ntransparent subsidy  policy documents  commitment to \nmechanism    transparency \n   \nOutputs       \nPhase 1      Assumptions \n1.
