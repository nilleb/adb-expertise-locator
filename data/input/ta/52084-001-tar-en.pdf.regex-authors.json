THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FACILITY \n \nA.  Justification \n \n1.  The regional transaction technical assistance (TA) facility will provide project preparation \nsupport and capacity building to a series of ensuing transport sector projects in Southeast Asian \ncountries, initially comprising (i) Integrated Road Network Improvement Project (Cambodia); \n(ii) Additional  Financing  to  Second  Northern  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS)  Transport \nNetwork Improvement Project (Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic); (iii) Bataan\u2013Cavite Bridge \nProject (Philippines); (iv) Laguna Lakeside Road Project (Philippines); (v) Manila Mass Rapid \nTransit Line 4 (Philippines); (vi) Bangkok Urban Transport Development - West Orange Line \n(Thailand); (vii) Regional Airports Improvement Project (Thailand); and (viii) Tak\u2013Mae Sot Road \nTunnel Project (Thailand). The TA facility and all ensuing projects are included in the draft Country \nOperations Business Plans (COBP) 2019\u20132021 for Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nThailand and the Philippines. \n \n2.  To  address  needs  of  developing  member  countries  for  a  higher  number  of  larger, \ninnovative and more technical complex projects, the transport sector pipeline for 2019\u20132021 \nincludes 27 new loan and periodic financing request approvals for the years 2019\u20132021 with an \nestimated loan amount of $7.2 billion and over $12 billion on a facility basis. This is a significant \nincrease of the portfolio from the existing 55 loans and grants with a cumulative effective loan \namount of $5.3 billion. The pipeline is on one side expanding into new subsectors such as railways, \nroad tunnels and air transport in Thailand and large bridges and railway infrastructure investments \nin the Philippines. On the other hand, more traditional road projects in Cambodia and Lao PDR \nshall increase in size for better relevance of ADB\u2019s investment and reduced transaction cost. \nTherefore, these projects are proposed to be financed as larger investment programs through \nmultitranche financing facilities (MFF) adopting the time-slicing approach. While these MFF are \nmore complex to prepare and implement, they will ensure a long-term relationship with the \ngovernment and help accelerate disbursement. \n \n3.  This significant increase in portfolio size will come together with a reduction of the number \nof projects financed, hence the individual projects will increase in size and complexity. Therefore, \nefforts to increase project readiness of these more complex and larger projects must be taken to \navoid start-up delays caused by delays in procurement or safeguards implementation of newly \napproved projects. This will ensure relevant and sustainable interventions and will help to improve \nportfolio performance. \n \n4.  Lack of project readiness to meet ADB requirements governing procurement, selection of \nconsultants, safeguards implementation especially for resettlement and land acquisition, and \nother thematic areas such as governance and gender have led to significant implementation \ndelays. Furthermore, weak project implementation and management capacity of executing and \nimplementing agencies has been a continuous challenge to improve portfolio performance. \nSpecific  issues  have  included  (i)  lack  of  government  capacity  to  address  complex  project \nimplementation challenges, particularly when a project needs restructuring; (ii) slow recruitment \nof consultants and procurement of works contracts; (iii) lack of attention to safeguards monitoring \nand reporting; (iv) poor contract management and construction supervision resulting in poor \ncontractor and consultant performance and low quality works; and (v) lack of knowledge sharing \non best practices and innovations across countries. Government unfamiliarity with ADB processes \nand poor communication with ADB project teams also contributed to poor project performance. \n \n ", "2   \n5.  The TA facility will help to provide (i) stronger, better and faster project delivery through \nexpanded  use  of  regional  approaches  and  faster  delivery  mechanisms,  and  (ii)  improved \ngeneration and sharing of knowledge. The TA facility approach is therefore suitable as it will (i) \nenhance project preparation efficiency and improve readiness for transport sector projects; (ii) \nbenefit from synergies by working with the same pool of consultants in different countries facing \nsimilar  implementation challenges  and  policy  issues,  reduce  lengthy consultant recruitment \nprocesses and improve knowledge transfer; and (iii) strengthen coordination. Overall, this TA will \nreduce transaction costs by minimizing the need for stand-alone transaction TAs, under which \nseveral consultant teams will be engaged. The TA will also provide capacity building support to \nongoing projects, where required, especially in the transitional phase between project processing \nand project implementation around the time of loan approval and loan effectiveness. The ongoing \nprojects are suffering from weak project implementation capacity and require similar technical \nspecialist support for procurement, safeguards implementation and institutional strengthening.  \n \n6.  The TA facility is aligned with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Strategy 2030 Vision \nfor a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific. The TA will support \nStrategy 2030 operational priorities such as (i) tackling climate change, building climate and \ndisaster resilience, and enhancing environmental sustainability; (ii) making cities more livable; \n(iii) strengthening governance and institutional capacity; and (iv) fostering regional cooperation \nand integration by supporting project preparation and strengthening the capacity of executing and \nimplementing agencies for effective project implementation. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Feasibility studies on ensuing projects prepared. Support will be provided \nto prepare investment projects for potential ADB financing. This will include due diligence, \nassessment of technical feasibility and suitability of the proposed solution, economic, financial \nand social viability, institutional, financial management and procurement capacity, environmental \nand social safeguards assessments, and identify measures to strengthen project implementation \ncapacity for ensuing investment projects. Deliverables will include, when required: (i) feasibility \nstudies  required  for  processing  the  ensuing  investment  projects;  (ii)  economic  analysis; \n(iii) financial  management  assessment,  financial  evaluation  and  financial  analyses; \n(iv) procurement capacity assessment, contract packaging and preparation of procurement plans, \npreparation of bid documents; (v) gender analysis, collection of baseline data and gender action \nplans; (vi) risk assessment and management plans; (vii) safeguards documents on environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement and indigenous peoples; and (viii) transport sector assessment. Activities \nunder Output 1 will include capacity building on ADB procedures and modalities, especially on \nadditional requirements for MFF in countries, where projects will be financed by MFF for the first \ntime. Outputs prepared under the TA, such as feasibility studies and linked documents will be \ndisseminated digitally and published on ADB\u2019s website. \n \n8.  Output 2: Initial project implementation activities supported. To avoid delays in the \ntransition between project processing and project implementation, the consultants will provide \nsupport to the executing and implementing agencies especially in the areas of procurement and \nsafeguards implementation. The support will be demand-driven and shall include support in \npreparing and carrying out the bidding process, including responding to questions during bidding, \nissuing addendum/corrigendum to bid documents, bid opening and bid evaluation and awarding \nthe contract. With respect to land acquisition and resettlement, the executing and implementing \nagencies will be advised in carrying out the process in line with ADB procedures and prepare the \nnecessary reports to be submitted to ADB for compliance. \n \n ", "3 \n9.  Output 3: Project management capacity of the executing agencies improved. The \nexperts working under outputs 1 and 2 will provide \u2013 in addition to the on-the-job training through \ntheir daily work with counterparts \u2013 additional training on ADB\u2019s policies and procedures as well \nas international best practice in project design and implementation as well as on specialized \nissues as identified during TA implementation. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n10.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $5,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund ($1,500,000 from TASF 6 and $3,500,000 from TASF-\nother sources).1 The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. The governments will provide \ncounterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, access to existing reports and data, and other \nin-kind contributions. The TA may be replenished from time to time as funds are required and \nidentified or cofinancing from trust-funds becomes available. The governments will be informed \nthat approval of the TA facility does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing projects. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The TA activities for the ensuing projects will start only after ADB achieved an agreement \nwith the concerned country to commence the activities. ADB will administer the TA. The TA scope \nis expected to cover other additional activities, consistent with the TA\u2019s outputs and outcome. \nRequests for additional or other projects shall be made by the governments and the ensuing \nprojects shall be included in the next COBP of the country. \n \n12.  The TA is categorized as complex based on the expected categorization of most of the \nensuing projects as complex. A table indicating the expected project risk categorization of the \nensuing projects and the funds allocated under the TA is in Appendix 2.  \n \n13.  The Transport and Communications Division of the Southeast Asia Department (SETC) \nwill select, administer, and evaluate consultants. SETC will supervise the consultants\u2019 outputs to \nbe delivered for the respective ensuing projects. Consultants services for each ensuing project, \nespecially consulting works in the individual country, will only start after an agreement on the \nscope  of  works, terms of  reference for the  consultants,  implementation  arrangements  and \nschedule, etc. has been confirmed.2  \n \n14.  The TA facility will be implemented over 36 months, commencing in December 2018.The \nimplementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n   \n                                                \n1  Country eligibility for ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund: Cambodia and Lao PDR for TASF 6; Cambodia, \nLaos PDR, the Philippines and Thailand for TASF-other sources. \n2  The confirmation by the government may be either in the form of signing of a TA-letter or by signing a Memorandum \nof Understanding or by confirmation of an Aide Memoire. \n ", "4   \nTable: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  December 2018\u2013December 2021 \nExecuting agency  ADB \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \n  Firm: QCBS (90:10)  Road project  $1,000,000 \npreparation (CAM) \n  Firm: QCBS (90:10)  Road project  $500,000 \npreparation (LAO) \n  Firm: QCBS (90:10)  Regional airport  $750,000 \ndevelopment (THA) \n  Firm: QCBS (90:10)  Metro project  $250,000 \npreparation (THA) \n  Firm: QCBS (90:10)  Road tunnel study  $500,000 \n(THA) \n  Individual: Framework  International  $450,000 \nagreement  expertise (20 person-\nmonths) \n  Individual: Individual  National expertise  $450,000 \nselection  (45 person-months) \nAdvance contracting  Consulting contracts are proposed for advance contracting.  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). \nAsset turnover or disposal  Procurement of assets is not planned under this TA. \narrangement upon TA \ncompletion \nADB = Asian Development Bank; CAM = Cambodia; LAO = Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic; QCBS = quality- and \ncost-based selection; TA = Technical Assistance; THA = Thailand. \nSource: Asian Development Bank\u2019s estimates. \n \n15.  Consulting services. ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions. Consulting firms will be engaged following either the quality- and cost-\nbased selection method, with a quality-cost ratio of 90:10 due to the complexity of the ensuing \nprojects and the requirement for specialized consulting firms. Terms of Reference for consulting \nservices supported by the TA Facility are in Appendix 3. Individual international consultants and \nconsultant firms, to the extent possible, will be engaged to support the preparation of more than \none project. The consultants will consist of transport specialists as primary experts, including \nengineers, economic, financial, procurement, social, environmental, gender expertise, and other \nexperts as required. The experts will have experience in their respective fields and demonstrate \nsound technical knowledge of road, rail and air transport sector. Disbursements under the TA \nfacility will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook \n(2010, as amended from time to time).  \n \nE.  Governance \n \n16.  Since ADB is the executing agency, the financial management, procurement and integrity \nrisks during TA implementation are assessed to be low. However, thorough risk assessments for \nfinancial management, procurement, and integrity for ensuing investment projects implemented \nin any of the target countries will be conducted under the TA. \n \n ", "5 \nII.
