THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n1.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) seeks to provide a financial intermediation loan to \nHousing Construction Savings Bank of Kazakhstan (HCSBK) to expand the access of female \nborrowers to affordable mortgage finance. The assistance is planned to be provided as  a \nsovereign-guaranteed loan in local currency equivalent of up to $100 million to HCSBK. The ADB \nloan will help HCSBK address the unmet but growing demand for long-term, fixed-rate mortgage \ncredit by using local currency funds to provide affordable mortgage finance to female borrowers. \nIt will be ADB\u2019s first-ever financial intermediation project in the country that targets exclusively \nwomen beneficiaries. \n \n2.  The proposed technical assistance (TA) grant will support HCSBK in its goal to improve \naccess to affordable housing finance by women and expand financial inclusion for women in the \ncountry through capacity building services primarily involving the following actions: (i) improve \nfinancial literacy among potential women borrowers in Kazakhstan, (ii) raise awareness for \ngender-related lending aspects in HCSBK\u2019s operations by hiring and training employees to \nbecome gender champions1 in its head office and some of its larger branches, (iii) assist in the \nimplementation of a comprehensive gender action plan in HCSBK,2 and (iv) enhance HCSBK\u2019s \ncustomer targeting by designing lending programs and products specific to women. \n \n3.  The project is consistent with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for Kazakhstan, 2017\u2013\n2021, which prioritizes access to finance and inclusive growth as key pillars of assistance to \nstrengthen foundations for economic diversification, envisaging support to facilitate access to \nfinance for those in rural and remote areas.3 The project is included in ADB\u2019s country operations \nbusiness plan for Kazakhstan, 2019\u20132021.4 \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.    Justification  \n \n4.  Kazakhstan has shown commitment to advancing gender equality and to engaging with \nthe international community to demonstrate its gender development progress. In line with this \ncommitment, Kazakhstan has developed a policy and legal framework that is designed to advance \ngender equality as a national goal. Kazakhstan has developed a long-term plan, outlined in its \nStrategy 2050,5 to join the thirty most developed countries by 2050. To reach its goal of a more \nrapid development, Kazakhstan is diversifying its economic base away from an overreliance on \nextractive  industries  toward  a  more  robust  small  and  medium-sized  enterprise  sector  and \ntransforming itself into a hub of regional economic corridors. The government acknowledges the \ncritical role of gender equality, and sees the potential to advance gender equality by promoting \nwomen\u2019s labor force participation, pay equity, social protection, reduction of regional disparities, \nand assistance to vulnerable groups to be integrated into future economic and social development \nstrategies. \n \n                                                \n1  Experts in gender related financing aspects. \n2  Gender Action Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2 of the report and recommendation   \n    of the President). \n3  ADB. 2017.

HCSBK and the Government of Kazakhstan requested the proposed transaction TA to \nsupport the government\u2019s initiatives to expand access of female borrowers to affordable local \ncurrency  mortgage  finance  efficiently  and  in  a  timely  manner.  The  results  framework, \nimplementation  arrangements,  cost  estimates,  and  the  scope  of  the  transaction  TA  were \ndiscussed with HCSBK and the government during the fact-finding mission. \n \n6.  The transaction TA will have the following primary outcomes: (i) a nationwide market study \nevaluating the current banking industry regarding access by women to housing finance products \ncompleted; (ii) the profile of women borrowers as a relevant and important business segment for \nHCSBK raised; and (iii) lending and/or deposit products exclusively aimed at women developed \nand efficiency of HCSBK\u2019s lending to women borrowers improved. The TA cannot be funded by \nthe proposed loan to HCSBK because targeting exclusively women borrowers (through the \npreparation of a nationwide market study and the development of new products geared at female \ncustomers) is a completely new market segment for HCSBK for which the bank does not have \nenough experience and expertise.6 \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.  Output 1: Long-term affordable mortgage financing for eligible women borrowers \nmade available. Under this output the TA will assist HCSBK in improving gender-related lending \naspects in HCSBK\u2019s operations through the following activities: (i) raise the profile of women \nborrowers as a relevant and important business segment for HCSBK, (ii) increase the volume of \nmortgage lending to women, and (ii) grow the percentage of HCSBK\u2019s female mortgagors. \n \n8.  Output 2: Efficiency of HCSBK\u2019s lending operations to women borrowers improved. \nThe TA will help enhance HCSBK\u2019s customer targeting by designing lending programs and \nproducts specific to women. Furthermore, the TA will help HCSBK adopt a gender policy. The TA \nwill support HCSBK in raising public awareness of lending products exclusively aimed at women \nthrough (i) conducting special public campaigns to raise awareness among the female population \nin  Kazakhstan  for  the  availability  of  gender  specific  financing  products  and  programs,  (ii) \nconducting  seminars  on  the  use  of  gender  indicators  for  decision-making  and  product \ndevelopment, and (iii) training employees in its head office and regional branches to become \ngender champions (Footnote 1). \n \n9.  Output  3:  Gender-inclusiveness  of  the  banking  industry\u2019s  housing  finance \nassessed. The TA will (i) prepare a comprehensive nationwide market study evaluating the \nbanking industry regarding access by women to housing finance products, (ii) identify related \nconstraints and issues, and (iii) estimate the demand and develop concrete ideas and financial \nproducts on how to increase financial inclusion from women borrowers. Furthermore, HCSBK, in \npartnership with the government, will organize a seminar to discuss the findings of the market \nstudy and agree on the way forward. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n10.  The TA is estimated to cost $620,000 and will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF\u2013other sources.)7 The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 1. \n                                                \n6  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 8 May 2019.  \n7  The Government of Kazakhstan contributed $120,000 to ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund to finance this  \n    proposed transaction TA. ", " 3 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n11.  The implementation arrangements for the transaction TA will be aligned with the proposed \nfinancial intermediary loan to HCSBK. ADB will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants and \nprocure goods (if necessary). The Government of Kazakhstan, acting through the Ministry of \nNational Economy, will be the executing agency, while HCSBK will be the implementing agency. \nThe TA will be implemented from January 2020 to December 2021. \n \n12.  ADB will engage individual consultants and a consulting firm in accordance with the ADB \nProcurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated staff instructions. \nDisbursements under the TA will be done in accordance with ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). ADB will select the consulting \nfirm through the quality- and cost-based selection method with a standard quality\u2013cost ratio of \n90:10. The estimated consultant inputs comprise 20 person-months of international, and 12 \nperson-months of national, consulting services. Output-based lump-sum consulting contracts will \nbe preferred. The proposing entities may suggest some adjustments, with justification. Depending \non the emerging circumstances, ADB will retain flexibility on the number and person-month \nallocations among the experts, as well as their tasks. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative Implementation period  January 2020\u2013December 2021 \nExecuting agency  HCSBK \nImplementing agency  HCSBK \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB through the quality- and cost-based \nselection method with a standard quality\u2013cost ratio of 90:10. \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \nADB = Asian Development Bank, HCSBK = Housing Construction Savings Bank of Kazakhstan, TA = technical \nassistance. \nSources: ADB, HCSBK. \n \n13.
