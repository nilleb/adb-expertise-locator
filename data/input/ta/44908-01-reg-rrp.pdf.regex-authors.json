Indicative Business Plan for CGIF \n ", " \nCREDIT GUARANTEE AND INVESTMENT FACILITY SUMMARY \n \nProposal  Establish the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF) as a \ntrust fund of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) with a capital \ncontribution of $130 million. \nClassification   Targeting classification: General intervention \nSector (subsector): Finance (finance sector development) \nThemes  (subthemes):  Regional  cooperation  and  integration \n(cross-border infrastructure, money and finance, other regional \npublic goods)  \n   \nEnvironmental and  Environment:      Category FI \nSocial Safeguards  Involuntary Resettlement:  Category FI \nClassification  Indigenous Peoples:    Category FI \n   \nTrust Fund   It is proposed that CGIF be established as a trust fund of ADB with \nindependent  governance  structures  involving  a  meeting  of \ncontributors,  a  board  of  directors,  and  its  own  internationally \nrecruited management and staff. Draft articles of agreement and \noperational policies are in Appendixes 2 and 3, respectively. \n   \nInvestment Description  It  is  proposed  that  ADB  provide  a  capital  contribution  of  $130 \n  million in CGIF as part of the capital required for guaranteeing \n  corporate local currency denominated bonds issued by investment-\n  grade corporations in the ASEAN+3 region.1  \n   \nFinancial Intermediary  As the first regionally owned bond guarantee agency, CGIF will be \na trust fund of ADB, jointly owned by the governments of ASEAN+3 \nand ADB. It will have a capital of $700 million, with $570 million \ncontribution from the governments of ASEAN+3 and $130 million \nfrom ADB.  \n   \nDevelopment Impact  The establishment of CGIF as a trust fund of ADB, together with a \ncapital  contribution  from  ADB,  will  support  regional  cooperation \nwithin  ASEAN+3  and  promote  regional  financial  resilience  by \nallowing  investment  grade  corporations  to  gain  access  to  local \ncurrency  and  regional  bond  markets.  As  the  result,  CGIF  will \nreduce  currency  and  maturity  mismatches  that  currently  create \nfinancial fragility in ASEAN+3. \n \n(i)  Impact. Reduce the currency and maturity mismatches of \ninvestment grade corporations by facilitating their access to \nlocal  currency  bond  markets  and  thereby  reducing  the  \nfragility of the financial markets in the region. \n \n(ii)  Outcome. With its credit guarantees for corporate bonds, \n                                                 \n1  ASEAN+3 consists of Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, \nMyanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the \nRepublic of Korea. ", "ii   \nCGIF  will  mobilize  savings  to  finance  investment  of \ncorporations in their own domestic markets and across the \nASEAN+3  region,  and  promote  the  harmonization  of \nstandards  and  practice  for  bond  issuance  in  ASEAN+3 \nleading to regional financial market integration \n \n(iii)  Outputs. CGIF will establish its independent governance \nstructures,  including  its  own  board  of  directors  and \nmanagement. Once a detailed business plan is approved \nby  the  CGIF  board  of  directors,  CGIF  will  commence \nguarantee operations. The environmental and social risks \ninherent  in  projects,  particularly  infrastructure  projects, \nfinanced  by  bonds  guaranteed  by  CGIF  will  be  fully \nmitigated  as  these  projects  will  comply  with  CGIF \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  requirements  as \ndetermined by ADB. CGIF will use its capital to back its \nguarantees  for  bonds  issued  by  investment  grade \ncorporations  in  ASEAN+3  to  gain  access  to  the  local \ncurrency bond markets.  Once its $700 million capital has \nbeen used for its guarantees, the CGIF board of directors \nwill review its role, organizational structure and operations \nto determine, for the decision of its meeting of contributors, \nwhether CGIF capital or its leverage ratio may be increased \n   \nProposed ADB  In cooperation with ASEAN+3, ADB will establish CGIF as its trust \nAssistance  fund and provide a capital contribution of $130 million. \n   \nRisks and Mitigating  Comprehensive due diligence has been undertaken in conjunction \nMeasures  with the governments of ASEAN+3. Since 2002, ADB has provided  \ntwo regional technical assistance projects (REG: 6127 and 6373 \nASEAN+3 Regional Guarantee Mechanism, Phase 1 and Phase 2) \nto examine all elements of CGIF, including its associated risks. The \nmain risks identified were: (i) a reputational risk for ADB resulting \nfrom  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  given  its  multiple  roles  and \nfunctions with regard to its involvement with CGIF (as its trustee, \ncontributor,  and treasury service provider); (ii) concentrated portfolio; \n(iii) staff's capacity to assess the credit worthiness of CGIF clients \nwith  international  technical standards;  (iv)  the  credit  risk  of  the \nCGIF portfolio; (v) foreign exchange risks, as CGIF will provide \ncredit guarantees for bonds denominated in a wide range of Asian \ncurrencies; (vi) need for a more detailed business plan; (vii) due to \nits leverage ratio of 1 to 1, CGIF's adoption of only the country and \ncurrency limits until such time as when its leverage ratio or capital \nmay be increased; and (viii) there is no clear exit strategy and \nrelatively a low return on investment, with an estimated of 6.8% \ninternal rate of return (IRR).   \n \nThe  identified  risks  will  be  mitigated  by  the  following \nconsiderations: (i) the articles of agreement for CGIF clearly state \nthe  different  roles  and  corresponding  functions  of  ADB  as  its \ntrustee,  as  its  contributor,  and  as  its  treasury  service  provider. ", "  iii\nThese roles and functions have been fully discussed and agreed \namong the representatives of ASEAN+3 and ADB. Moreover, CGIF \nwill have its own governance structure and operations separate \nfrom those of ADB; (ii) a dynamic approach will be adopted to \ndetermining  credit  loss  provisioning  to  mitigate  CGIF's \nconcentrated  portfolio;  (iii)  obtaining  a  bilateral  rating  from  a \nreputable international rating agency to verify and assist CGIF staff's \nindependent credit judgment; (iv) CGIF guarantees will be provided \nonly  to  issuers  with  a  minimum  investment  grade  and  CGIF  will \nmaintain  a  leverage  ratio  of  1:1;  (v)    prudent  foreign  exchange \nprovisioning will be put in place, based on 99% Value at Risk point \nof  local  currency  movement  for  the  individual  bonds  to  be \nguaranteed by CGIF; (vi) while an indicative business plan has \nbeen prepared, a detailed  business plan and an internal risk rating \nmodel  will  be  developed  following  the  appointment  of  CGIF \nmanagement and prior to commencement of guarantee operations; \n(vii) other prudential limits, in line with international best practice \nwill be considered if and when CGIF's leverage ratio is increased \nor CGIF is recapitalized; and (viii) the IRR of CGIF will improve \nshould its leverage ratio or capital be increased. CGIF's articles of \nagreement  stipulate  the  review  of  its  operations  after  each \noperational  period  of  10  years  or  earlier.  The  CGIF  board  of \ndirectors  will  review  its  role,  its  organizational  structure  and \noperations to evaluate the suitability and effectiveness of ongoing \nCGIF operations, and based on the outcome of each review, the \nmeeting of contributors will determine consequential changes to \nthe role, organizational structure, and operations of CGIF, including \nits possible termination, as appropriate. \n   \nJustification / ADB  Justifications for the formation of CGIF as a trust fund of ADB and \nValue-Added  for ADB's capital contribution to CGIF are as follows:  \n \nIncreased  access  of  investment-rated  corporations  to  local \ncurrency bond markets and lengthening the bond maturity. \nWith CGIF guarantees, eligible corporations will be able to gain \naccess to local currency debt markets and lengthen the maturity of \ntheir bonds to meet long-term financing needs in their domestic \nbond  markets  and  across  the  region.  This  will  help  reduce \ncorporations' dependency on short-term foreign currency loans as \nwell as the financial markets' vulnerability to sudden disruption of \ncapital inflows to the region.    \n \nDevelopment of local currency and regional bond markets in \nASEAN+3.  With  its  guarantees,  CGIF  will  help  develop  the \ndomestic and regional bond markets as it will encourage greater \nmarket participation by issuers in local currency bond markets. It \nwill also broaden the investor base by providing increased credit \nprotection. \n \nEnhanced regional cooperation in ASEAN+3. CGIF is a key part \nof a regional initiative that has been developed over the past five ", "iv   \nyears  through  policy  dialogue  coordination  and  collaboration \namong ASEAN+3 and ADB on financial issues of common interest \nthrough cooperative regional solutions. CGIF will provide a useful \nmodel  for  further  regional  initiatives.  As  CGIF  will  provide \nguarantees  for  bonds  across  the  region,  it  will  promote  the \nharmonization of standards and practices for bond issuance with \nASEAN+3, paving the way for regional financial market integration  \n   \nImplementation  CGIF will be implemented as an ADB trust fund and comply with all \nArrangements  applicable  ADB  policies.  ADB  will  be  the  trustee  of  CGIF  and \ndischarge  its  trustee  functions  through  its  Managing  Director \nGeneral. Following commencement of CGIF guarantee operations, \nADB's Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) will assume \nprimary responsibility for administering CGIF.  \n ", "11 \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on the proposed \nestablishment of the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF) as a trust fund of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) with the provision of a capital contribution of $130 million. \n \nII.   BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE \n \nA.  Economic and Regional Development Background \n \n2.  One of the most valuable lessons from the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998 was the \nneed to develop local currency bond markets as an alternative source of funding to domestic \nand foreign bank loans. At that time, bank lending dominated and, with inadequate hedging \nopportunities, corporations and financial institutions were highly vulnerable to foreign exchange \nrisk.  Also,  since  bank  funding  was  predominantly  short  term,  long-term  investments  were \ncommonly financed through short-term borrowings. These currency and maturity mismatches \nmade domestic balance sheets vulnerable to sudden withdrawal by foreign creditors, which \nhelped trigger the crisis. Since then, to ensure the availability of long-term domestic currency \nfunding (and thereby alleviate the maturity and currency mismatches) and better channel the \nregion's savings into regional investment, East Asian policy makers have worked together to \npromote and develop local currency and regional bond markets.  \n3.  In December 2002, the finance ministers of members of the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations (ASEAN), the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), Japan, and the Republic of \nKorea  (ASEAN+3)  launched  the  Asian  Bond  Markets  initiative  (ABMI)  to  promote  the \ndevelopment of local currency bond markets. ASEAN+3  has focused on policy support to \nexpand the supply of bonds denominated in Asian currencies, improve credit information on \ndebt  issuers  to  allow  better  investment  decisions,  and  help  build  market  infrastructure \nsupporting cross-border bond issuance and investment. Another regional initiative to support \nlocal currency bond market development was the Asian Bond Fund, launched by Asian central \nbanks through the Executives Meeting of East Asia\u2013Pacific Central Banks in June 2003. \n4.  To address some of the root causes of the 1997\u20131998 crisis, individual ASEAN+3 \nmembers  have  undertaken  national  financial  sector  reform  on  their  own.1 Reforms  have \nincluded restructuring balance sheets to dispose of nonperforming loans, overhauling bank \nownership,  privatizing  state-owned  institutions,  reforming  financial  sector  governance, \nupgrading  macro-prudential  oversight  through  revamped  regulations  and  supervision,  and \nintroducing new products and businesses.  \n5.  Since 1997, local currency-denominated bonds outstanding in emerging East Asia2 have \ngrown sharply from under $1 trillion in 2001 to $4.4 trillion in December 2009. However, much \nmore needs to be done to give corporations better access to the region\u2019s bond markets and \noffer a variety of maturities to meet issuers\u2019 financing needs. For example, regulators normally \nprescribe a minimum rating for bond investments for the companies they supervise\u2014generally, \nA for banks and AA for insurance companies\u2014or in some cases limit insurance companies to \nhold bonds up to a certain percentage of their portfolio. The risk\u2013return properties of these \nmarkets have not yet developed to the point where lower-rated companies can sell bonds no \nmatter what the price may be. Moreover, domestic investors in emerging Asian markets have \n                                                 \n1 In Indonesia, Philippines, and Thailand, the reforms have been notably supported by ADB \n2 ASEAN, the PRC, and the Republic of Korea. ", "2   \ngreater affinity for equities as corporate bonds are relatively new investment instruments in the \nregion. \n6.  These factors are compounded by the lack of local bond guarantee agencies to enhance \ncorporations' ratings to gain full market access.3 Most guarantee agencies in the region provide \nloan guarantees for small and medium-sized enterprises; however, most of these agencies \nrequire annual fiscal support, given the nonperforming loan rate of 2%\u20134% generally associated \nwith this lending. Neither the skills set nor the small capitalization of such guarantee agencies \nallows them to be bona fide bond guarantee agencies. \n \n7.  Limited access to bond markets poses particular problems for corporations with long-\nterm financing needs\u2014such as infrastructure companies, whose investments generally have a \ngestation of 15\u201320 years and whose revenues are generated in local currency. One option has \nbeen  bank  financing,  but  loans  seldom  extend  beyond  3  years,  posing  refinancing  risks \nthroughout the life of the project. A second alternative has been overseas financing, but this \nentails foreign exchange risks. \n \n8.  CGIF aims to address the challenges of currency and maturity mismatches faced by \ncorporations.  It  does  so  by  providing  credit  guarantees  to  enable  them  to  raise  long-term \nfunding to meet their financing needs. CGIF will make it possible for these corporations to issue \nbonds  within  their  domestic  markets  and  across  ASEAN+3.  CGIF,  consequently,  will  help \nmobilize regional savings for regional investment and make the regional financial system less \nvulnerable (Appendix 1). \n \nB.  Background for Institutional Support  \n9.  CGIF will be one of the first regional financial entities under ASEAN+3 and will provide a \nuseful model for further regional initiatives. CGIF was developed under ABMI, with ADB serving \nas secretariat over the past 7 years. The concept of CGIF has been carefully nurtured and \nstudied by ASEAN+3 members individually and cooperatively, all of whom have requested ADB \nto establish CGIF as a trust fund of ADB. \n10.  At  the  ASEAN+3  Finance  Ministers\u2019  Meeting  in  May  2009  in  Bali,  Indonesia,  the \nministers endorsed establishing CGIF with an initial capital of $500 million: $200 million each \nfrom  Japan  and  the  PRC  and  $100  million  from  the  Republic  of  Korea.  Following  further \nconsultations in ASEAN, it is now expected that ASEAN members will contribute a further $70 \nmillion in capital, and ASEAN+3 has requested ADB to contribute $130 million. The capital \ncontribution for CGIF is therefore expected to be $700 million. \nC.  Alignment with ADB Strategy Operations  \n11.  The proposal to support CGIF as a trust fund of ADB and to contribute $130 million in \ncapital supports ADB\u2019s Strategy 20204 and is fully aligned with ADB\u2019s regional cooperation and \nintegration strategy.  \n                                                 \n3  A bond is considered investment grade if its credit rating is BBB\u2013 or higher by Standard & Poor\u2019s or Baa3 or higher \nby Moody\u2019s or BBB (low). Generally they are bonds that are judged by the rating agency as likely to meet payment \nobligations. \n4  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. ", "  3\n1.  Consistency with Strategy 2020 \n12.  Enhanced regional cooperation and integration is in line with the Agreement Establishing \nthe Asian Development Bank (the Charter)5 and Strategy 2020. Under Strategy 2020, ADB will \npursue its vision and mission by focusing on three complementary strategic agendas: inclusive \ngrowth,  environmentally  sustainable  growth,  and  regional  integration.  In  line  with  its  new \nstrategic agenda to promote greater regional integration, ADB aims to scale up its support for \nregional cooperation and integration (RCI), increasing both the volume of its RCI operations and \nthe share of RCI in total operations. In addition, under Strategy 2020, ADB clearly indicates that \nit will strengthen its support to the finance sector regionally and nationally by helping to develop \nfinancial infrastructure, institutions, products, and services. Regionally, ADB will continue to \nsupport  cross-border  bond  transactions.  For  the  emerging  regional  bond  market,  ADB  will \nfacilitate the creation of a harmonized regulatory framework, credit guarantee mechanism, and \nregional clearing and settlement system. Through these initiatives, ADB will continue to assist in \nchanneling the region\u2019s savings into the most productive investments, in particular developing \ncapital markets. CGIF will operationalize most of the areas identified for ADB intervention to \npromote regional financial sector development.   \n2.  Consistency with the Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy \n13.  ADB's  strategy  on  regional  cooperation  and  integration  recognizes  that  different \napproaches  must  be  adopted  depending  on  circumstances.6 The  four  pillars  of  regional \ncooperation  and  integration  are  (i) the  promotion  of  cross-border  infrastructure and  related \nsoftware, (ii) trade and investment cooperation, (iii) monetary and financial cooperation and \nintegration, and (iv) cooperation in promoting regional public goods. CGIF is consistent with the \nthird  pillar of  cooperation  and  integration  on  financial  cooperation  to  help  reduce  member \ncountries\u2019  poverty  through  regional  collective  action  that  develops  financial  systems  and \nstrengthens macroeconomic and financial stability. CGIF fully reflects regional cooperation and \nintegration  efforts  in  ASEAN+3  and  is  the  outcome  of  ADB's  support  for  these  formative \ninstitutional efforts. \n \n3.  Lessons from Previous Operations \n \n14.  In formulating the concept for CGIF, valuable lessons were drawn from the experience of \nAsian Finance and Investment Corporation (AFIC) and Asian Securitization and Infrastructure \nAssurance Limited (ASIA Ltd) and that of international financial institutions that were severely \naffected by the recent financial market turmoil.  \n \nA.   AFIC \n \n15.  AFIC was established in 1989 in Singapore with an initial capitalization of US$115 \nmillion. The shareholders comprised ADB (as the largest shareholder) and 25 international \ncommercial banks from Asia, USA and Europe. AFIC's main objective was to provide long term \nloans and equity investments to private sector medium-sized industrial enterprises in ADB's \ndeveloping  member  countries.  However,  its  effectiveness  in  achieving  this  objective  was \nseverely constrained by the following factors. \n \n16.  AFIC had 23 shareholders from a diversity of economies (Japan; the United States; \nEurope; Republic of Korea; Taipei,China; Hong Kong, China; and Singapore). Although ADB \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 1966. Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. Manila. \n6 ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila. ", "4   \nwas the largest shareholder with 30% holding, it did not have veto power. AFIC operated as an \nassets booking house with a high cost of borrowing, extended loans with longer-term maturity, \nand invested in long-term assets (unquoted equity investment). Its board met on average three \ntimes a year but there was no hands-on approach by any of the shareholders. \n \n17.  While the list of shareholders appeared impressive, many shareholders held a very \nsmall stake in AFIC. With only two to four percent stake in the company, there was little \nincentive for them to scrutinize project proposals. In addition, they themselves were also hit by \nthe crisis and had to deal with their own problems. AFIC had a small capital base and as such \ncould not be a lead institution but only a participant. Lending is an economy of scale business, \nwhich requires relatively cheaper funding sources, such as deposits, which AFIC did not have. \nFurthermore,  the  lending  business  needs  very  robust  risk  management,  which  like  many \nfinancial institutions in the region at that time, AFIC lacked. \n \n18.  AFIC  financed  its  long-term  lending  activities  and  equity  investment  with  no  fixed \nrepayments/divestments with short-term (between 3 and 5 years) and high cost borrowings.  As \na result of the high cost of funding, AFIC had to take higher risk in lending to borrowers to have \nhigher yield assets. AFIC also made small equity investments in illiquid stock markets. AFIC did \nnot  make  regular  visits  to  the  accounts.  Due  to  budget  constraints,  rather  than  firsthand \nmonitoring, staff depended on co-financiers to monitor accounts and due diligence exercises \nwas largely undertaken in house. \n \nB.    ASIA Ltd. \n \n19.  Established in Singapore in 1995, ASIA Ltd. was Asia\u2019s first regional credit guarantee \nagency with more than a commercial objective: to facilitate the development of fixed income \nmarkets in Asia. ASIA Ltd.'s shareholders included CapMAC Asia Ltd., Apmac Investment Pte \nLtd., ADB, Employees Provident Fund of Malaysia, American International Assurance Co. \nLtd., Kookmin Bank, Netherlands Development Finance Co., and Deutsche Investitions and \nEntwicklungsgesellschaft mbH. \n \n20.  ASIA Ltd. began with paid-in capital of $150 million and arranged, guaranteed, and \nreinsured $2.5 billion in Asian credit over a 2-year period. This created a leverage ratio for \nASIA Ltd. of about 1:17. It was rated a single A during the early part of its operations. The \nAsian financial crisis, however, led to a rating agency downgrade of its claim-paying ability in \n1998. Although the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998 hastened the demise of ASIA Ltd., it \nwas not the fundamental cause, as discussed below.  \n \n21.  At the end of 1999, the company's $934 million credit-insurance portfolios consisted \nmostly of sovereign, asset-backed, infrastructure, and financial institution debt obligations \nthroughout Asia. In terms of geographic distribution, 24% of ASIA Ltd.'s guarantees and \nassumed reinsurance were outstanding to Korea; 11.4% to Malaysia; 10.3% to Indonesia; \n9.1% to Hong Kong, China; and 20.9% to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment countries other than the Republic of Korea. The downgrades of credit ratings for \nIndonesia and the Republic of Korea had flow-on effects for ASIA Ltd., requiring it to allocate \nadditional  capital  at  risk  for  the  countries  downgraded  and  for  specific  guarantees.  The \nclaims-paying ability of ASIA Ltd. was downgraded by Standard and Poor's (S&P) from A to \nBB. As the result, ASIA Ltd. had to stop writing new business. \n \n \n \n ", "  5\n22.  ASIA Ltd.'s business model had fundamental flaws. It was undercapitalized with only \n$150 million, which was about half of the minimum capital recommended by S&P.7 ASIA \nLtd.\u2019s initial rating was too low to benefit higher-rated customers or to withstand a downturn or \nthe volatility typical of emerging markets.  \n \n23.  Inadequate risk management also caused difficulties for ASIA Ltd. The absence of risk-\nsharing mechanisms with local financial institutions and guarantee agencies imposed undue \nrisks  on  ASIA  Ltd.  Moreover,  some  of  ASIA  Ltd.'s  shareholders  were  focused  purely  on \ncommercial issues and their own problems and saw no need to contribute additional equity \nwhen the company faced a downgrade. ASIA Ltd.\u2019s own A rating limited its ability to source \nbetter-quality business. A single A rating is insufficient to add sufficient economic value to \nattract a diversity of risk and support a robust business portfolio. \n \n24.  Drawing from the lessons learned from AFIC and ASIA Ltd., CGIF has been designed \nto achieve an international rating of AAA. Its governance structure is in line with international \nbest practice and, taking into account lessons from the experiences of international financial \ninstitutions  that  were  severely  affected  by  the  recent  financial  turmoil,  segregates  senior \nexecutives responsible for risk management from those responsible for operations.  \n \n25.  As a guarantee can be highly risky and easy to extend without a full consideration of the \nassociated risks, the emphasis in designing the governance structure of CGIF was to ensure \nthat a guarantee cannot be extended without the required full financial due diligence and the \nendorsement from the chief risk officer (CRO), who is independent from the chief executive \nofficer (CEO), and the management of CGIF. In addition, the board of CGIF will be required, \nwhen evaluating each guarantee operation for approval, to consider the advice of an external \nadvisory panel of independent experts on financial due diligence. More detailed information on \nthe governance structure of CGIF is below in section III B. \n \n26.  The financial policies of CGIF are highly prudent. CGIF will operate within the limits of \nits own available capital.8 Unless approved by the meeting of contributors, the leverage ratio of \nCGIF operations will be 1:1. Should its leverage ratio rise beyond 1:1, its liabilities in excess of \nits capital will be reinsured to fully cover any potential losses. Moreover, CGIF will provide \ncredit guarantees only to issuers with a minimum rating that is at least investment grade. \n \n27.  To ensure that CGIF has the capability to carry out its operations effectively, CGIF will \nadopt internationally competitive human resource policies that will allow it to attract and retain \ncapable  management  and  professional.  Provisions  have  been  made  to  equip  CGIF  with \nadequate resources to meet its operating costs, in particular to undertake the risk assessment \nand monitoring of its guaranteed projects to ensure compliance with CGIF operational policies \nand relevant ADB operational policies. \n \nD.  Development Impact \n28.  CGIF will have significant developmental impact on the region, as it will help reduce \ncorporations\u2019 currency and maturity mismatches and improve the resilience of the financial \nsystem in the region. The Asian financial crisis revealed the vulnerability of the region to sudden \ndisruptions in the increasingly globalized financial markets. The more resilient financial system \nwill  make  the  region  less  vulnerable  to  external  shocks  and  will  help  improve  financial \nintermediation between savers and investors in the region. Equally important, CGIF is a part of \n                                                 \n7 Standard and Poor's. 2006. Bond Insurance Industry Overview and Analytical Focus. (29 June 29, p. 4).  \n8 Available capital includes paid-in capital and retained earnings less reserves and any illiquid assets. ", "6   \na key regional initiative that has been developed over the past 5 years through the policy \ndialogue, coordination, and collaboration of ASEAN+3 and ADB on financial issues of common \ninterest. As such, CGIF will provide a useful model for further regional initiatives. As CGIF will \nprovide credit guarantees for bonds across the region, it will promote the harmonization of \nstandards and practices for bond issuance in ASEAN+3, paving the way for regional financial \nmarket integration.  \n  1.   Contribution to Economic Growth and Poverty Alleviation \n \n29.  CGIF will contribute to economic growth and support poverty alleviation by making it \npossible for investment grade corporations to gain access to their local currency bond markets \nfor financing longer-term investments, notably in infrastructure (Appendix 2 and 3). Private \ncorporations will benefit more than public corporations, as the former currently find it more \ndifficult to access longer-term local currency financing. These investments will finance economic \nactivities and create jobs. In addition, the more resilient financial system that CGIF aims to \nachieve will help protect the poor from the major setback in employment that normally result \nfrom severe economic downturns caused by the collapse of financial systems (Appendix 4). As \nwitnessed  during  the  Asian  financial  crisis,  the  sharp  economic  downturn  pushed  tens  of \nmillions  in  the  region  below  the  poverty  line  and  reversed  overnight  the  gains  in  poverty \nreduction that had taken decades for regional economies to achieve.   \n \n30.  According to a study published in 19989, unemployment rose in the three worst-affected \ncountries by about 5% in Indonesia, about 4% in Thailand, and nearly 5% in the Republic of \nKorea during 1997-1998. Since these countries had enjoyed high growth, low jobless rates, \nrelatively equal income distribution, and low crime rates for decades, the sudden social distress \nwas felt even more acutely. Moreover, most Asian countries had not yet developed meaningful \nsocial safety nets. In the same study, Lee and Rhee also demonstrated that it was the marginal \nworkers\u2014young, female, less experienced, and less educated\u2014who were most affected by the \ncrisis. They were more likely to be unemployed long term and fall below the poverty line.10 \n \n2.  Outputs and Outcome \n31.  CGIF will establish its independent governance structures, including its own independent \nboard of directors and management. An initial business plan has been prepared for CGIF. This \nwill be elaborated on and finalized after CGIF has been established. This detailed business plan \nwill be approved by the CGIF board of directors before the commencement of CGIF operations. \nAll projects financed by bond guarantees will comply with ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009). CGIF will use its capital to back its credit guarantees for bonds issued by investment \ngrade corporations in ASEAN+3 to access the local currency bond markets. Once its $700 \nmillion capital has been used for its guarantees, the CGIF board of directors will review its role, \norganizational  structure  and  operations  to  determine,  for  the  decision  of  its  meeting  of \ncontributors, whether CGIF capital or its leverage ratio may be increased (see Appendix 1).  \n32.  The establishment of CGIF as a trust fund of ADB with capital contributions from ADB \nand ASEAN+3 countries will help mobilize savings to finance long-term investment domestically \n                                                 \n9  Jong-Wha Lee and Changyong Rhee. 1998. The Social Impacts of the Asian Crisis: Policy Challenges and \nLessons.  \n10  Based on a survey of the Asian crisis and its implications by the Economic Analytical Unit of the Department of \nForeign Affairs and Trade of the Government of Australia, the Asian financial crisis depressed output, employment, \nand earnings; raised prices; and significantly worsened living standards, poverty, and equity. In 1998, average \nliving standards measured as real (inflation adjusted) per capita gross domestic product fell 16% in Indonesia, 12% \nin Thailand, 10% in Malaysia, 8% in the Republic of Korea, and 3% in the Philippines.  ", "  7\nand regionally, and promote the harmonization of standards and practice for bond issuance in \nASEAN+3 leading to regional financial market integration. \nIII.   THE FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY \nA.  Ownership \n33.  The contributors in CGIF will be the governments of ASEAN+3 and ADB. Ownership \nrights will be in proportion to capital contributions, with Japan providing $200 million, the PRC \n$200 million, the Republic of Korea $100 million, ASEAN countries collectively $70 million, and \nADB $130 million. It has been agreed that, in recognition of their contributions, Japan and the \nPRC would have two seats each on the board of directors, the Republic of Korea one seat, \nASEAN countries collectively one seat, and ADB one seat. In addition, the chief executive \nofficer (CEO) will be an ex officio member of the board. Accordingly, the board will have eight \nmembers, each of whom will have one vote in board deliberations. \nB.  Governance Structure \n34.  As a trust fund of ADB, CGIF will have certain obligations and rights. CGIF will be \nrequired to follow applicable ADB operational policies and to present an annual activity report \nincluding  audited  financial  statements  for  the  information  of  the  ADB  Board  of  Directors. \nOperating as a trust fund of ADB, CGIF will enjoy ADB\u2019s privileges and immunities. While there \nis no financial obligation beyond the capital contribution from ADB or from any of the ASEAN+3 \ncountries, there are significant reputational benefits. In addition, CGIF will benefit from tax-\nexempt treatment and legal protection for its records and documents. ADB will discharge its \ntrustee functions through the Managing Director General. \n \n35.  Under its powers as trustee, ADB will delegate control of CGIF operational functions to \nthe meeting of contributors. The articles of agreement (Appendix 2)11 require that a meeting of \ncontributors be held at least annually. More frequent meetings will be held as required for \neffective decision making. \n \n36.  In turn, the meeting of contributors will delegate routine policy decisions to the CGIF \nboard of directors, which will consist of professionally qualified directors12 appointed by the \ngovernments of ASEAN+3 and ADB. The CGIF board will be headed by a chairperson, and \nthere will be three important board committees for (i) internal control and risk management, (ii) \nnominations  and  remuneration,  and  (iii)  audit.  The  CGIF  board  will  approve  and  monitor \noperational policies and financial reporting for CGIF, including the final approval of all bond \nguarantees it issues. However, day-to-day operational decisions will be undertaken by the \nmanagement of CGIF, headed by the CEO, who will provide an effective link by serving on the \nboard and reporting to the board chair.  \n37.  The articles of agreement require that all board members be professionally qualified. In \naddition,  certain  members  of  the  board  committees  will  require  specific  qualifications.  For \nexample, the chair of the audit committee must have training and experience in accounting, \nauditing, and international financial reporting. The chair of the audit committee will also directly \nappoint and supervise the CGIF internal auditor.13 Perhaps more importantly, the chair of the \ninternal control and risk-management committee must be professionally qualified in managing \nfinancial risk in financial institutions. In addition, the chair of the internal control and risk-\n                                                 \n11 There is a general consensus between ASEAN+3 and ADB on the Articles of Agreement for CGIF, and discussions \non operational policies are under way. \n12 As specified in the draft operational policies (Appendix 3). ", "8   \nmanagement committee will appoint and supervise the activities of the CGIF CRO, who will \nchair the guarantee and investment committee at the management level.  \n38.  The governance of CGIF will be augmented by the external advisory panel, which will be \ncomposed of three independent experts in financial sector and guarantee operations. The \nmembers of the panel will sit in on board and board committee deliberations without any voting \npower  and  have  access  to  board  and  management  documents  and  staff  to  ensure  full \nappreciation of the technical issues involved. Before the board makes a decision on any matter \nthat are not routine, the external advisory panel will provide its independent technical advice on \nthe merits of the proposal and recommend acceptance or rejection of the proposal before the \nboard. The board is free to make any decision it deems appropriate, but, in cases where the \ndecision is not in accord with the independent advice of the external advisory panel, the reasons \nmust be stated as part of the board decision. Such cases will be reported annually to the \nmeeting of contributors.  \n39.  CGIF will be operated in the best interests of its contributors, with its purposes and \nobjectives met through the most efficient use of its resources in an accountable, transparent, \nand socially responsible manner. CGIF will be operated strictly on commercial grounds to \nensure its financial viability and the maintenance of its AAA rating.    \n \n1.  Management \n \n40.  The CGIF organizational structure is shown in Figure 1. \n \n41.  Chief executive officer. The CEO will be the most senior officer, responsible for day-to-\nday operations and ensuring that CGIF meets the mandates, financial targets, annual budgets, \nand business plans approved by the board of directors. Upon the recommendation of the board \nof directors, the meeting of contributors will approve the selection of the CEO. As the trustee, \nADB will then appoint the CEO.  \n \n42.  Management committees. Two committees will assist in the management of CGIF: \n(i)  The executive committee, chaired by the CEO, will meet weekly to decide all \noperational matters that are not routine. \n(ii)  The  guarantee  and  investment  committee,  chaired  by  the  CRO,  will  meet \nperiodically to assess and manage CGIF risk.  \n \n43.  The  CRO  will  report  directly  to  the  chair  of  the  board\u2019s  internal  control  and  risk-\nmanagement committee and to the CEO on day-to-day operations and administrative matters. \n \n44.  Bond guarantees that have been identified and endorsed by the CEO will be screened \nby the guarantee and investment committee chaired by the CRO. If the guarantee proposals are \ndeemed viable, they will then be submitted to the board for consideration. \n \n45.  CGIF executives, except for the CRO and internal auditor, report directly to and are \nresponsible to the CEO. \n \n                                                                                                                                                          \n13 The internal auditor will report to the CEO regarding administrative matters.

Corporate Governance \n46.  Corporate  governance  will  be  under  the  direction  of  the  CEO  and  the  executive \ncommittee. Membership in the executive committee will initially be determined by the board of \ndirectors. All CGIF activities will be governed by CGIF operational policies (Appendix 3). The \ninitial  operational  policies  will  be  approved  by  the  meeting  of  contributors  but  subsequent \nrevisions or additions must be proposed by the executive committee and approved by the board \nof directors.  \n \n47.  There will be two important exceptions to the control of the CEO and the executive \ncommittee over corporate governance. The first exception is that the internal and external \nauditors will report directly to the chair of the audit committee and be under her/his functional \ncontrol (though administratively reporting to the CEO). The second exception is that the CRO \nwill report directly to the chair of the internal control and risk management committee and be \nunder her/his functional control (though administratively reporting to the CEO). While the CEO \nand the vice-president of operations will be in charge of developing guarantee proposals in line \nwith the operational policies, the CRO and the guarantee and investment committee will be \nresponsible for determining that the risk inherent in each guarantee proposal is acceptable \nbefore the proposal can be considered by the CGIF board of directors. \n \n  3.  CGIF Long-Term Strategy and Business Plan \n \n48.  CGIF\u2019s strategy defines the long-term goals of CGIF and the operational approaches for \nachieving  them.  These  goals  and  operational  approaches  will  be  reflected  in  the  detailed \nbusiness plan that will be prepared by the CEO in consultation with the executive committee. \nThis plan and the CGIF credit rating methodology will be approved by the CGIF board prior to \nundertaking  any  guarantee  operations.  CGIF  management  will  then  be  responsible  for \nimplementing the business plan, with the board monitoring compliance with it. If there are \ndifficulties in meeting objectives of the business plan, management will inform the board as \nsoon as possible. This will enable the board to recommend or take appropriate corrective action. \n \n4.  Financial Policies \n \n49.  CGIF will be financed solely from capital contributed by member countries and ADB. \nCGIF will not borrow from any source to finance its operations except for the purposes of cash \nmanagement. For example, it may well be advantageous to use short-term borrowing rather \nthan liquidate an investment position to meet a call on a guarantee or another CGIF operational \nrequirement. Allowing borrowing for cash management is not intended to create net liability but \nsimply supply liquidity.  \n \n50.  The aggregate amount of contingent liabilities that may be assumed by CGIF at any time \nby the issuance of guarantees outstanding will not exceed the total paid in capital of CGIF plus \nretained  earnings,  less  provisions  for  credit  and  foreign  exchange  losses  and  all  illiquid \ninvestments. The meeting of contributors, with a recommendation from the board of directors, \nmay approve leverage above 1:1, as appropriate, provided that the excess over the total paid in \ncapital of CGIF plus retained earnings, less provisions and all illiquid investments made by \nCGIF, are reinsured. A detailed counterparty risk policy, including a minimum rating for re-\ninsurers, will be included in the CGIF risk management framework. \n \n51.  The CGIF guarantee fee will be market-based and will reflect the risk of the underlying \ncredit CGIF is guaranteeing. The benefit of the CGIF guarantee is measured in terms of the \nreduced  interest  rate  cost  associated  with  the  upgraded  bond  issue.  The  benefit  will  be ", " 11\nassessed  with  the  full  involvement  of  the  issuer  and  the  guarantee  fee  for  CGIF  will  be \nnegotiated with the issuer, and will be at least commensurate to the underlying credit risk of the \nbonds to be guaranteed by CGIF and will meet CGIF's criteria of a minimum return on capital.14 \n \n52.  General  guarantee  loss  provisions  refer  to  \"ex-ante\"  provisions  related  to  future \nuncertain  events. For  purposes  of  determining  an  appropriate  level  of  general  provisions, \nguarantees  are  equivalent  to  loans.  Because  the  CGIF  portfolio  will  be  necessarily \nconcentrated, general guarantee loss provisioning will be set in line with the internally generated \nbond ratings mapped to international ratings so that the probability of default on each bond and \nthe  entire  portfolio  can  be  fully  assessed  and  adequately  provisioned.    During  its  initial \noperations, CGIF will obtain a bilateral rating from a reputable international credit rating agency \nto verify and assist CGIF's independent credit judgment of its potential clients and for its credit \nloss provisioning until such that time that the consistency of its internal ratings with that of \ninternational ratings is established. In addition, CGIF management will make specific provisions \nfor any guarantee at risk on a case-by-case basis based on the ongoing monitoring of all \nguarantees outstanding.  \n \n53.  CGIF guarantee operations involve the issuance of guarantees for local currency bonds \ndenominated most  commonly in one of the currencies of the ASEAN+3 countries (US dollars \nmight also be used by some of these countries for bond guarantees but that would present no \ncontingent  foreign  exchange  risks  for  CGIF  as  its  functional  currency  is  the  US  dollar). \nNevertheless, CGIF will be exposed to considerable currency risk as it will guarantee bonds \ndenominated in a wide range of Asian currencies. To ensure that CGIF leverage ratio is within \n1:1, a marked to market value adjustment of its guarantees will be undertaken weekly.  \n \n54.  The contingent foreign exchange risks can be significant over the period that the local \ncurrency bonds are expected to be outstanding.15 In the absence of market instruments to \nhedge  contingent  foreign  exchange  risks,  CGIF's  initial  contingent  foreign  exchange  risk \nprovisioning will be prudently determined based on the 99% value at risk point of local currency \nmovement for individual bond guaranteed by CGIF based on the historical volatilities of foreign \nexchange forwards or the implied volatilities of foreign exchange options with tenors of at least 1 \nyear. Since the volatilities can increase significantly in times of market stress, either a buffer will \nbe applied to these results or the highest volatilities from the entire period for which data are \navailable will be used. The foreign exchange provisioning will take into account the maturity of \nthe  individual  bonds  guaranteed  by  CGIF.  The  determination  of  the  foreign  exchange \nprovisioning will be made annually; however, in case of a higher than expected depreciation of \nthe US dollar, CGIF will set aside additional provisioning to ensure that CGIF is able to maintain \nits 1:1 leverage ratio.  This foreign exchange provisioning will be separate from the credit loss \nprovisioning. \n                                                 \n14 CGIF's minimum return on capital is determined by its Board, based annually on the nominal yield to maturity on a \n5-year government security (or equivalent) in each currency. \n15 Using the survey demand for the expected currency denomination of the local currency bonds (Demand Study for \nCGIF, January 2009), the distribution of guarantees in ASEAN+3 currencies would have meant that those \ncontingent foreign exchange risks over the historical five-year periods from 1975 to 2005 would have resulted in \ngains/losses between -0.29% and +0.264% during these five-year periods, assuming that 1.0% of the guarantees \nare called. This is much higher than the 0.27% deferred rates expressed on BBB rated bonds as calculated by \nMoody's from 1920-2009. While such contingent foreign exchange risks can theoretically be covered by long dated \noptions, such options are not generally available in Asia due to a combination of factors associated with exchange \ncontrols, the lack of suitable counterparties, inadequate maturities on the available swap rates and the very high \ncosts in the isolated situations where OTC solutions could be made available. As a result, commonly accepted \nmarket practices in Asia do not include the use of options to cover contingent foreign exchange risks and, as a \nresult, the reserves for contingent foreign exchange losses will be set in line with the volatility of the currency of \ndenomination of the guarantee extended. ", "12   \n5.  Risk Management \n55.  CGIF\u2019s  external  auditor  will  be  appointed  by  the  meeting  of  contributors  upon  the \nrecommendation of the board of directors, based on the consideration of the audit committee. \nBoth the internal and the external auditors will report on all functional issues to the chair of the \naudit committee. The CRO will likewise be appointed by the meeting of contributors upon the \nrecommendation of the board of directors, which is based in turn on the recommendation of the \ninternal  control  and  risk  management  committee.  Auditing,  reporting,  and  operational  risk \nmanagement will be functionally independent of management. As these individuals will not \nparticipate  in  corporate  bonuses,  they  will  be  financially  independent  of  the  volumes  of \nguarantees extended. Under the corporate governance structure of CGIF, the CRO will have \nfinal authority to endorse a guarantee proposal to the board for its consideration. \n \n56.  The  other  important  governance  safeguard  is  that  salaries  will  be  internationally \ncompetitive.  A  top-ranked,  internationally  qualified  staff  is  essential  for  successful  CGIF \noperation. Bonuses will be paid to CGIF staff from a pool equal to 10% of CGIF profits. The \ndistribution of the bonus pool will be based strictly on merit. However, bonuses will not be paid \nuntil the bonds guaranteed in that year have been fully repaid without any calls. Should there be \nany calls on CGIF guarantees issued in that year, the bonus pool will take the first loss. \n \n57.  The CRO will prepare and present a CGIF policy on the management of risk (risk \nmanagement framework) for CGIF, following approval by the board of directors. This policy \ntogether with the detailed business plan and internal risk rating model will be formulated for the \nearly consideration and adoption of the internal control and risk management committee of the \nboard of directors. This policy and the detailed business plan must be adopted prior to the \nguarantee and investment committee\u2019s consideration of CGIF guarantees. The following are the \nguiding principles for the risk management framework. \n \n(i)  Prior to Guarantee Consideration by the CGIF Board of Directors: \n \n(a)  Corporate bond issuers must have at minimum an investment-grade credit \nrating  (BBB)  on  a  credit-rating  scale  using  international  technical \nstandards16  to  be  considered  for  a  CGIF  bond  guarantee.  Both  the \nquantitative and qualitative data for each corporation will be used as inputs \nto CGIF's internal credit rating model to arrive at the risk rating of the \nconcerned corporation to confirm that it meets the minimum rating of BBB \nusing international technical standards. \n(b)  CGIF will then undertake full financial due diligence on the client and its \nproposed bond issue. Where substantial financial risks are identified, CGIF \nstaff will attempt to mitigate them satisfactorily in cooperation with corporate \nmanagement.  \n(c)  During  this  financial  due  diligence,  CGIF  must  ensure  that  there  is  no \ncorporate activity in prohibited investments (para. 197 of the operational \npolicies in Appendix 3). \n(d)  During financial due diligence and in consultation with local counsel, the \ncorporate bank, and the credit-rating agency, CGIF must ensure that there \nare  no  financial,  legal,  or  reputational  risks  that  could  adversely  affect \ncapacity to repay the debt during the life of the proposed bond guarantee.   \n(e)  In  cooperation  with  the  client's  investment  bank  and  the  bond  pricing \nagency  (where  available),  CGIF  will  assess  the  credit  spreads  for  the \n                                                 \n16 Where there is no domestic credit-rating agency, CGIF will undertake the initial credit rating where appropriate. ", " 13\nproposed guarantee and discuss the potential pricing of the guarantee and \nthe resulting rating with the issuer and the credit rating agency. \n(f)  A report on financial due diligence on a proposed guarantee must include \nthe findings of the financial due diligence mission,  its recommendations for \nfurther  processing,  and  issues  for  consideration  by  the  guarantee  and \ninvestment committee. The report must be provided to the CEO, CRO and \nexternal advisory panel. If found to be within acceptable risk parameters by \nthe guarantee and investment committee, a guarantee under consideration \nmay be submitted to the board of directors and the external advisory panel \nfor their consideration. \n \n(ii)  Management of Board of Directors Approved and Outstanding Guarantees: \n \n(a)  Establish a risk management system to identify, manage, and monitor risks \naffecting capacity to repay debt during the period of the CGIF guarantee. \n(b)  Undertake annual reviews based on the results of the required annual \ncredit  rating  of  the  bond  issue  and  monitor  the  credit  rating  results  in \nconjunction with management. During these annual visits ensure that the \nproceeds of the bond issue have been used for the intended purposes \n(allowing for the fungibility of money) and ensure that the covenants on the \nbonds continue to be complied with. \n(c)  Based  on  these  annual  reviews,  prepare  an  individual  report  on  each \nimplementation mission to the CGIF executives concerned with required \nrecommendations  for  further  actions.  CGIF  will  closely  monitor  its \nguarantees to ensure that additional provisioning is set aside should the \ncredit of its client deteriorate. \n(d)  Prepare  a  quarterly  implementation  report  on  the  status  of  all  CGIF \nguarantees  outstanding  and  provide  the  quarterly  report  to  the  CGIF \nexecutives  concerned,  members  of  the  internal  control  and  risk \nmanagement committee of the board of directors, and external advisory \npanel. \n \n58.  During the initial phase of CGIF's operations, it will obtain a bilateral rating from a \nreliable and reputable international rating agency to verify and assist CGIF staff in assessing the \ncredit worthiness of its potential clients and in determining guarantee loss provisioning for CGIF \nuntil such time as CGIF staff's independent credit judgment is deemed satisfactory. \n \n \n6.  Prudential Safeguards \n \n59.  There are a number of key prudential safeguards that will be incorporated in CGIF's \noperational policies. The prudential limits ensure that CGIF will not become unduly exposed to \nindividual country risks, industries, industrial groups, or individual issuers. The country exposure \nlimit of 20% of CGIF capital will ensure that smaller countries have access to CGIF guarantees \nand that its portfolio will be appropriately diversified. However, to minimize the currency risk for \nthe CGIF portfolio, a currency limit on its operations will be set at 40% of its capital.13 The \nindustry limit, based upon S&P classification, will be limited to 30% of the country limit, while the \nindividual issuer will be limited to 12% of the country limit. However, the limited size of CGIF \n                                                 \n13 This limit would allow, for example, a Japanese corporation to issue bonds denominated in Thai baht. While this \nguarantee would be charged to the Japan country quota, it could double the potential issuance in baht from 20% to \n40%. ", "14   \ncapital requires that single issuer, group exposure, and sector limits be waived until such time \nas the CGIF leverage ratio is raised or its capital is increased. \n \n7.  Management of Capital Resources \n \n60.  Payment for the shares subscribed by the contributors will be received by the trustee \nand  deposited  by  ADB  for  CGIF.  The  trustee  will  invest  this  account  in  money  market \ninstruments  in  line  with  ADB  policies  until  the  CGIF  board  and  management  have  been \nappointed.  \n \n61.  The primary objective in the management of CGIF's capital resources is to protect the \nprincipal by maintaining a prudent exposure to market, credit and liquidity risks. Liquidity must \nalways be available to meet potential calls on guarantees issued so that all investments should \nbe marketable within a reasonable timeframe. Within the constraints determined by this primary \nobjective, CGIF will strive to maximize returns on the invested asset portfolio while minimizing \nthe volatility of investment income. To this end, CGIF capital resources will be placed with the \nADB Treasury Department to manage at a fee of 10 basis points. Once CGIF is established, \nCGIF  management  will  discuss  with  ADB  specific  investment  strategies  and  performance \nbenchmarks for the CGIF board of directors approval. The agreed investment strategies will be \nin line with ADB risk management policies and investment guidelines and in line with the \nmaturities of CGIF's specific guarantee operations, as well as with CGIF financial policies as \nreflected in the operational policies and articles of agreement.  \n \nC.  Business Overview and Strategy \n \n62.  A demand study for guarantees covering Cambodia, PRC, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, \nMalaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam was conducted in the last quarter of \n2008.14 In each country, interviews were conducted with market regulators and others such as \nsecurity and exchange agencies, central banks, ministries of finance, local credit-rating and \nbond-pricing agencies, investment banks, and institutional investors. The objective of the study \nwas to determine the kinds of potential issuers and their potential volumes of issuance. The \nfocus was on general corporate issuers, securitization issues, and other potentially long-term \nfinancial requirements such as for infrastructure and other public\u2013private partnerships. The \nstudy showed that there were no local institutions providing third-party guarantees for local bond \nissues,  though  some  supranationals  like  ADB  provided  guarantees  in  some  cases.15 Most \nmarket  participants  fully  endorsed  the  proposal  to  establish  CGIF  in  order  to  encourage \ninvestment-grade corporations to issue bonds denominated in local currency.    \n \n63.  The study determined that the issuers most likely to benefit from the establishment of \nCGIF would be those rated between BBB and A (see Appendix 6 for an explanation of common \nratings).16 Because of common prudential regulations, banks can generally invest only in bonds \nrated A, while insurance and pension plans can invest only in bonds rated AA. However, issues \nof bonds rated AA or even AAA will also benefit from CGIF as its guarantees will enable them to \nextend their bond maturities and/or issue bonds outside their domestic markets. There did not \nappear to be strong demand for securitization issues. Expectations were that opportunities \nmight arise with respect to residential mortgages; however, the timing is uncertain. For long-\n                                                 \n14 Supplementary Appendix A.  \n15 A credit guarantee agency, Danajamin Nasional Berhad, subsequently opened in Malaysia in May 2009.  \n16 Potential issuers are generally given a preliminary rating and, if that rating is below A, do not generally complete \nthe rating process, as they know that the likely rating will not allow them to access their local currency bond market. \nSo the actual population of these corporations between A and BBB cannot be ascertained from the ratings of the \nlocal currency rating agencies.   ", " 15\nterm financing such as for infrastructure, demand is high, and there is abundant demand from \ninsurance companies, banks, and other investors for well-structured infrastructure paper. To \nestimate  the  demand,  a  bottom\u2013up  approach  was  used  wherein  demand  estimates  were \nconstructed  from  assumptions  involving  the  basic  building  blocks,  such  as  the  number  of \npotential issuers currently excluded and the size of their likely issues. \n \n64.  As the demand study for corporate guarantees assumed that CGIF would not be fully \noperational  until  2011,  demand  estimates  begin  that  year.  As  shown  in  the  table,  the \nconservative estimate of demand for CGIF guarantees amounts to $3.5 billion in 2011 and rises \nto $4.7 billion in the 5 years to 2016, for a compound annual growth rate of 6%. For the future \nyears included to make up a 10-year financial forecast period, the demand growth rate in the \n2017\u20132020 period was assumed to be 5%. For this longer period, if CGIF is able to meet this \nconservative estimate of demands for bond guarantees, the guarantees extended would amount \nto over $24 billion.  \n \n \nDemand for Bond Guarantees in ASEAN+2 \n($ million) \n \n \nTotal ASEAN+2 Projections  2011  2012  2013  2014  2015  2016 \n \n \nGeneral Corporate Bonds                   \n   New issuance per year  1,280  1,440  1,620  1,830  2,070  2,350 \n     Outstanding  1,280  2,720  4,340  6,160  8,230  10,580 \n             \n  \nSecuritization Issues             \n   New issuance per year  150  170  190  210  230  260 \n     Outstanding  150  320  500  710  950  1,210 \n             \n  \nInfrastructure Finance             \n   New issuance per year  2,040  2,040  2,040  2,040  2,040  2,040 \n     Outstanding  2,040  4,080  6,110  8,150  10,190  12,230 \n             \n  \nTotal               \nNew issuance per year  3,470  3,640  3,840  4,080  4,340  4,650 \n  \n     Outstanding  3,470  7,110  10,950  15,030  19,370  24,020 \n \n                       \nASEAN+2 = Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Republic of Korea. \nSource: Based on the outcome of the market survey undertaken under RETA 6327. \n \n \n \nD.  Financial Performance \n \n1.  Projected Financials \n \n65.  The financial analysis covers 2011\u20132020 based on the demand study baseline. The \nfinancial analysis for CGIF is shown in Appendix 5 with the base case shown in Table A5.1. It \nshows an initial capital of $700 million for 2011, augmented in succeeding years by retained \nearnings. No recapitalization has been assumed, and the final capital in 2020 is projected to \namount to $858 million based on the initial capital and retained earnings.  \n ", "16   \n66.  The  estimated  demand  for  bond  guarantees  rises  from  $3,470  million  in  2011  to \n$5,652 million in 2020.17 In this base case scenario, the assumption is no use of leverage. As \nshown in Appendix 5, Table A5.1, CGIF will extend $100 million of guarantees per annum in the \nyears from 2011 to 2013 and, thereafter, $150 million per annum until 2020.The leverage ratio \nwill be kept well below 1:1, rising from 0.14 in 2011 to 0.87 in 2020. Based upon these \nassumptions, the pilot CGIF will be able to meet 3% of the estimated cumulative demand for \nbond guarantees throughout 2011\u20132020. \n \n67.  Under the base case scenario, the principal income items as shown in Table A5.2 are \ninterest  income  on  the  $700  million  capital  (an  assumed  return  of  1.6%  per  annum  with \ninvestments in US Treasuries with an average maturity of 3\u20135 years) and guarantee fees that \nare assumed to amount to 150 basis points on total guarantees of $100 million. Together with \nupfront guarantee fees, the total income in 2011 is estimated to be $13.0 million. \n \n68.  Principal expenses include staff costs that, based upon the initial skills mix and 23 staff \npositions, will amount to $5.5 million. Facility leasing, board of director expenses, credit rating \ncosts, and other expenses are estimated at another $3.3 million, for a total cost of $8.8 million in \n2011. Net income in 2011 is projected to be $4.2 million, rising to over $26 million in later years. \nThe internal rate of return (IRR) for the entire period is estimated to be 6.8%, almost double the \nreturn on the equivalently rated 10-year US Treasury bond of about 3.8%. \n \n2.  Financial Resilience \n69.  It is expected that CGIF will maintain financial viability under stringent stress tests as \nshown in Appendix 5. For example, a simulated 10% portfolio failure rate in 2016 (Table A5.3) \ndue to an economic dislocation in one economy would lead to an estimated loss of over $44 \nmillion in 2016 (Table A5.4), and reduce the IRR to 5.8% from 6.8% in the base case.  \n \n70.  A much more stringent depression stress test is structured along the lines of the Bond \nInsurance Capital Adequacy Model proposed by S&P for bond issuers like CGIF. 18 As shown in \nTables A5.5 and A5.6, the depression is assumed to be deep, with 5% default loss in each of \nthe 4 years of the depression, more than double the maximum default rates that actually \noccurred during the Great Depression.19 Additionally, during the simulated depression years of \n2014\u20132017, no new guarantee business was assumed to have been written, and, while no cuts \nwere made in staff strength, the returns on invested capital were appropriately reduced. With \nthese depression-oriented conditions, CGIF had substantial losses during these years, albeit \ndeclining in magnitude. The IRR for the entire period was nonetheless positive at 4.8%, down \nfrom 6.8% in the base case. The CGIF financial structure is resilient to these potential major \nshocks. \n \nE.  Unique Public\u2013Private Structure \n71.  CGIF will be established as a trust fund of ADB with capital contributions from ASEAN+3 \ngovernments and ADB. CGIF has the public purpose of creating regional public goods in the \nform of enhanced financial resilience in ASEAN+3. The operations of CGIF will be conducted on \ncommercial terms. They will assist those corporations in ASEAN+3 with a minimum investment \n                                                 \n17 The growth rate beyond 2016 was estimated to be 5.0% per year. \n18 Standard and Poor's. 2006. Global Credit Portal. (21 June, pp. 13\u201316). \n19 The largest single-year loss during the Great Depression for the lowest-rated investment bonds (Baa) was 2.0%, \naccording to Moody\u2019s Investor Services. 2010. Corporate Default and Recovery Rates 1920\u20132009, February. \nExhibit 31. The largest single-year losses during the Great Depression were 1.0% in 1931, 1.8% in 1933, 1.9% in \n1935, and 2.0% in 1938. ", " 17\ngrade (Appendix 6) needed to gain access to local currency bond markets and thereby reduce \ncurrency and maturity mismatches. The public goods nature of CGIF will ensure that it fully \nsupports the development of local currency bond markets, in full cooperation with domestic \ncredit-rating agencies and regulatory institutions. Additionally, CGIF will help ensure over time \nthe gradual fostering of market segments in the local currency bond markets that are currently \nabsent (Appendix 7). \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  ADB Assistance and Transaction Structure \n \n72.  The proposed ADB assistance has two principal components: (i) establishing CGIF as a \ntrust fund of ADB and (ii) providing to CGIF a capital contribution of $130 million, which will \nrepresent over 18% of CGIF\u2019s total capital. The proposed trust fund and the capital contribution \nare fully consistent with ADB policies and both have open-ended timeframes. There is no exit \nstrategy for the proposed CGIF investment except for its eventual closure and the distribution of \ncapital and retained earnings to its ASEAN+3 contributors and ADB. However, after each \noperational period of no more than 10 years, the board of directors will review the role of CGIF, \nits organizational structure, and its operations to evaluate their suitability and effectiveness. \nBased on the outcome of each review and the recommendations of the board of directors, the \nmeeting  of  contributors  will  consider  and  determine  changes  to  the  role,  organizational \nstructure, and operations of CGIF, including its termination, as appropriate. \n \nB.  Justification for ADB Assistance \n \n73.  CGIF is an integral part of policy actions to promote the development of the bond \nmarkets supported under ABMI. Establishing CGIF as a trust fund of ADB will considerably \nshorten its set-up time. If not as a trust fund of ADB, CGIF's establishment would involve a \nlengthy process requiring ASEAN+3 legislative bodies to accept the articles of agreement. In \nthe  meantime,  the  continued  financial  fragility  arising  from  residual  currency  and  maturity \nmismatches could endanger financial stability in the region, as they appeared to do during the \nrecent international financial crisis. The proposed ADB  capital contribution responds to an \nASEAN+3 request for that level of contribution and will serve as a useful catalyst to accelerate \nCGIF guarantee operations. Lastly, ADB\u2019s strong performance record in managing its own \ninvestment resources means that ADB will bring expertise in this area to directly benefit its \nmember countries\u2019 regional cooperation. \n \nC.  Risks and Mitigation Measures \n \n74.  Comprehensive due diligence has been undertaken in conjunction with the governments \nof ASEAN+3 since 2002 supported by two regional technical assistance projects from ADB, to \nexamine all elements of CGIF, including its associated risks. The main risks of the proposed \ncapital contribution and its mitigation measures are as follows: \n \n(i)  Conflict of interest.  As ADB will be the trustee, contributor, and treasury service \nprovider of CGIF, these roles and functions combined could cause potential conflict \nof interest and pose a reputational risk for ADB.  To mitigate any potential conflict of \ninterest and protect ADB's reputation, the articles of agreement for CGIF clearly \nstate the specific functions of each role that ADB will undertake. These roles and \nfunctions have been fully discussed and agreed with among ASEAN+3 and ADB. \nMoreover, CGIF will have its own governance structure and operations\u2014including ", "18   \nits  own  meeting  of  contributors,  board  of  directors,  management  and  staff\u2014\nseparate from those of ADB. \n \n(ii)  Concentrated portfolio.  With an initial paid-up capital of $700 million, CGIF will \nbe able to guarantee no more than 10 issuers and as such will likely have a  \nconcentrated portfolio, heightened by its focus on the ASEAN+3 region.  Although \nthis risk can be partly mitigated by provisioning for credit loss and foreign exchange \nrisk, in the event of a sharp economic slow down in the region that could lead to its \npossible downgrade, CGIF will ensure to operate within the leverage ratio of 1:1.        \n \n(iii)  Capacity of CGIF staff to apply international technical standards to its clients.  \nCGIF  staff  will  rate  its  potential  clients  by  applying  ''international  technical \nstandards'' to assess their credit worthiness to ensure that its selected clients will \nhave a minimum BBB rating using the international technical standards. However, \ngiven that CGIF will be newly established, its staff's capacity to rate its clients will \nbe untested. To mitigate this risk, for each guarantee transaction considered by \nCGIF, it will obtain a bilateral rating from one of the reputable international rating \nagencies to assist in its decision on its guarantees.  \n \n(iv)  Credit risk of the guarantee portfolio. To mitigate the risk of CGIF's concentrated \nportfolio, it will adopt a dynamic approach to determine the required guarantee loss \nprovisioning based on the credit quality and rating of its portfolio. Each guarantee \nwill be reviewed annually, and, in the event of any credit deterioration of its clients, \nadditional provisions will be set aside.  Moreover, CGIF will closely monitor issuers \nwhose ratings are expected to fall below the international investment grade (BBB). \n \n(v)  Currency risk. CGIF will be exposed to considerable currency risk as it will provide \ncredit guarantees to bonds denominated in a wide range of Asian currencies. To \nensure that the leverage ratio of CGIF is maintained at 1:1, a marked-to-market \nvalue adjustment of its guarantees will be conducted weekly.  Given the lack of \nother mitigation measures for this risk, the initial contingency foreign exchange \nprovisioning will be prudently calculated based on the 99% value at risk point of \nlocal currency movements (for individual bond guarantees) taking into account the \nmaturity of the guaranteed bonds.  The determination of the provisioning will be \nmade annually, and in case of a higher than expected depreciation of the US dollar, \nCGIF will set aside additional provisioning to ensure that CGIF maintains its 1:1 \nleverage ratio.    \n \n(vi)  Lack of a detailed business plan.  An indicative business plan has been prepared \nfor  CGIF.20 However,  as  CGIF  management  has  yet  to  be  appointed,  a  more \ndetailed business plan and an internal risk rating model will be developed upon the \nappointment  of  CGIF  management  and  prior  to  CGIF's  commencement  of  its \nguarantee operations.      \n \n(vii)  Incomplete prudential limits.  During the pilot operations of CGIF (i.e. during the \nperiod of the initial capitalization of US$700 million), there will essentially be two \nprudential limits in place--country and currency limits. However, other prudential \nlimits such as those for sector, single issuer, and group exposure will be considered \nfor adoption in line with international best practice if and when its leverage ratio or \ncapital is increased.  \n                                                 \n20 Supplemental Appendix B. ", " 19\n \n(viii) Lack of exit strategy and relatively low return on investment.  Given the unique \nnature of CGIF's policy mandate, its articles of agreement do not have an explicit \nexit strategy but stipulate the review of its operations after each operational period \nof 10 years or earlier. CGIF's board of directors will review its role, organizational \nstructure and operations to evaluate the suitability and effectiveness of ongoing \nCGIF operations. Based on the outcome of each review, the meeting of contributors \nwill  consider  and  determine  consequential  changes  to  the  role,  organizational \nstructure and operations of CGIF, including its possible termination, as appropriate. \nMoreover, if and when CGIF's leverage ratio or capital is increased, its internal rate \nof return would improve from the current estimate of 6.8%. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Environment and Social Safeguards \n \n75.  CGIF will comply with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) and the applicable \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  requirements  of  concerned  ASEAN+3  governments \n(Appendix 8). It will adopt and implement an environmental and social management system \n(ESMS) that adheres to these environmental and social safeguard requirements.21 CGIF will \nadopt an ESMS in conformity with ADB's ESMS framework prior to its first guarantee operations \n(Appendix 8). The environmental and social safeguard review procedure described in the ESMS \nwill be integrated into CGIF's due diligence, appraisal, approval, and monitoring procedures. \nCGIF will assign staff with the necessary safeguard capacity, qualifications and experience to \ndevelop and implement the ESMS. It will designate the guarantee and investment committee as \nthe decision-making and reviewing authority for the ESMS. CGIF will prepare an annual report, \nwith respect to guarantees extended, summarizing the following: (i) performance of clients in \nimplementing  the  safeguard  plans  (EMP,  resettlement  plan  or  IPDP)  and  compliance  with \napplicable government laws and regulations, and ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement; (ii) areas \nof noncompliance arising during safeguard plan implementation, corrective measures adopted, \nand outstanding issues requiring follow-up actions, if any; and (iii) findings from periodic reviews \nof the ESMS, and recommendations for improvement. \n \nB.   Implementation Arrangements \n \n76.  CGIF will report annually with fully audited financial statements through its board of \ndirectors at its meeting of contributors. These reports, prepared in compliance with international \nreporting standards, will also serve CGIF\u2019s reporting requirements as a trust fund of ADB.  \n \n77.  CGIF will undertake an annual credit-rating review to ensure the maintenance of its AAA \ncredit rating. To help ensure that the ongoing business of CGIF is healthy, each guarantee \nextended by CGIF will be closely monitored to ensure that corrective action is taken should it be \nfound to be at risk.  \n \n78.  Although there is no specific financial target for CGIF, it must maintain its AAA rating and \nbe  financially  healthy  to  ensure  its  continued  effectiveness  in  meeting  its  public  policy \nobjectives. The appropriate financial target for CGIF will be based on a minimum rate of return \nfor each guarantee. This requires that CGIF must not extend a guarantee if the return is not at \n                                                 \n21 See CGIF Operational Policies, Environment and Social Management System Framework, pp. 100\u2013103 (Appendix \n3). ", "20   \nleast commensurate  with  the  underlying  credit  risk  of  the  bond  and meet  at  least  CGIF's \ncriterion of a minimum return on capital. \n  \n79.  The primary responsibility for monitoring and meeting CGIF\u2019s responsibilities rests with \nthe CEO, reporting through the board of directors to the meeting of contributors. However, that \nresponsibility  is  shared  with  (i)  the  CRO,  regarding  financial  risks  and  in  respect  of  the \nenvironmental and social safeguards; (ii) the internal auditor, regarding accounting, auditing, \nand financial reporting standards; and (iii) the oversight committees of the CGIF board of \ndirectors, namely the internal control and risk-management committee and the audit committee. \nThe overall responsibility for monitoring CGIF performance and the performance of the CEO \nrests with the board, which is responsible for recruiting and dismissing the CEO, in consultation \nwith the meeting of contributors. \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy \n \n80.  CGIF will fully comply with ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \nCombating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism (2003), as detailed in CGIF \noperational  policies  (Appendix  3).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability,  and  transparency,  CGIF  will  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal \nprocedures and controls following international best practices to prevent corruption, money \nlaundering and the financing of terrorism.  \n \nD.  Investment Limitations \n \n81.  The  proposed  capital  contribution  by  ADB  of  $130 million  will  be  less  than  ADB\u2019s \nmaximum limit of 25% of the total committed capital, but will exceed the single exposure limit of \n$75 million.22 However, the proposed contribution is considered to be appropriate given the \ncommitments  of  ASEAN+3  and  the  unique  and  important  role  CGIF  will  play  in  reducing \nfinancial fragility in the region. \n \nE.   Processing \n \n82.  The proposed capital contribution by ADB is an \u2018equity investment\u2019 for purposes of \nArticle 11 of the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank. Even though equity \ninvestments are to be processed by PSOD, 23 CGIF has been processed by OREI. CGIF is a \nunique regional initiative that arose out of the on-going ABMI work of OREI, and involves \nongoing policy dialogue and close cooperation to promote regional economic and financial \nintegration among ASEAN+3 member countries. The issues involved therefore differ from those \nfor  a  typical  non-sovereign  equity  investment.  OREI  has  had  primary  responsibility  for \nprocessing  CGIF  but  has  been  working  closely  with  other  departments  including  PSOD. \nFollowing  commencement  of  CGIF  guarantee  operations,  PSOD  will  assume  primary \nresponsibility for administering CGIF.  \n \n                                                 \n22 The maximum amount of ADB's direct equity investment shall be lower of (a) 25% of net worth, or (b) $75 million. \nSource: Review of ADB's Exposure Limits on Nonsovereign Operations dated September 2009.  \n23 ADB. 1983.

Background \nA.   Mandate \n1.  CGIF was established by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations1, plus the People's \nRepublic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (\"ASEAN+3\") and the Asian Development \nBank  (ADB)  as  part  of  the  Asian Bond  Markets  Initiative  to  develop  and  strengthen  local \ncurrency and regional bond markets so that investment grade coporations can access those \nmarkets and avoid currency and maturity mismatches.  \n \n2.  The basis for operation of CGIF is set out in the Articles of Agreement (AoA) as adopted \nby the Contributors. ADB is the Trustee of CGIF and, in accordance with the AoA, ADB holds in \ntrust and manages all CGIF funds and assets. In its capacity as Trustee, and acting on the basis \nof  recommendations  from  CGIF,  ADB  under  Articles  10.1.8  through  10.1.10  of  the  AoA, \nappoints and terminates all management executives, professional staff and consultants of CGIF. \n \nB.   Objective \n3.  The objectives of CGIF are to promote economic development, to promote resilience of \nthe financial markets and to prevent disruptions to international financial order by developing \ndeep and liquid local currency and regional bond markets. CGIF provides a guarantee to enable \ninvestment-grade ASEAN+3 issuers to access local currency bond markets. This promotes a \nmore efficient allocation of Asian savings within the region by facilitating access by entities rated \ninvestment-grade to such markets while promoting the issuance of longer-term debt securities \nto match the life of investment projects. \n. \nC.  Functions \n4.  To meet these objectives, CGIF works commercially within ASEAN+3 markets on several \nfronts: \n(i)  guaranteeing bonds that are denominated in local currencies and issued \nby  entities  rated  investment-grade,  in  such  a  manner  as  to  reduce \ncurrency and maturity mismatches; \n \n(ii)  by entities rated investment-grade, provided the entities concerned are \nnaturally hedged in such currency; \n \n(iii)  making  investments  for  development  of  the  bond  markets  (no  such \ninvestments shall be made until after the Meeting of Contributors has \ndetermined that CGIF is in a position to commence such operations); and \n                                                 \n1 The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) comprises Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam. ", "Appendix 3  55 \n \n(iv)  undertaking  such  other  activities  and  providing  such  other  services \nconsistent with CGIF objectives (including appropriate substitute credit \nrating arrangements for Brunei Darussalam and the new ASEAN member \ncountries of Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Myanmar and \nViet Nam). \n5.  CGIF  will  only  consider  corporations  for  credit  enhancements  where  they  meet  the \nminimum  requirement  of  being  rated  investment-grade  under  local  credit  rating  standards. \nUnder international credit rating standards, the sovereign rating typically forms the ceiling for the \ninternational  corporate  ratings  from  that  country.  As  such,  CGIF  will  adjust  the  equivalent \ninternational rating of a corporate issuer and the international credit rating of the sovereign. For \nexample, under international credit ratings, the Philippines is rated BB-,, and hence a corporate \nsuch as San Miguel Coporation, cannot have a rating exceeding BB-, which is the current \nrating2. A BB- rating is below investment grade3 and therefore might be deemed to carry \nsignificantly higher credit risk. By adjusting for the difference between San Miguel Corporation\u2019s \nBB- international rating and its AAA local rating3, CGIF will be able to consider San Miguel \nCorporation as an eligible recipient of its guarantee product. For Brunei Darussalam and the \nnew ASEAN member countries which currently have no credit rating agencies, CGIF staff and \nconsultants will undertake due diligence on their own on potential issuers to assess their credit \nworthiness. In all cases, CGIF guarantee decisions will be based upon a further financial due \ndiligence carried out by CGIF staff and consultants. \n \n6.  CGIF may, in the future, undertake equity investments to support the development of \nbond  markets  within  ASEAN+3.  No  such  investments  can  be  made  until  the  Meeting  of \nContributors has determined that CGIF is in a position to commence such operations. The \nBoard of Directors will first need to approve the detailed criteria that such investments will need \nto satisfy. All such investments will be subject to providing minimum returns on capital and will \nbe limited to a maximum of 25% of the equity in such entities. Any proposed investments will \nneed to pass a stringent review process involving the Guarantee and Investment Committee at \nthe management level and, if successful, by the full Board of Directors. Investments where \nCGIF might play an important role in promoting the bond market development include credit \nrating agencies or bond pricing agencies where equity investors have often been difficult to find. \nSuch investments are not envisaged until the bond guarantee operations of CGIF are fully and \nsuccessfully established, and in aggregate they are not expected to use more than a minor part \nof CGIF\u2019s capital. \n \n7.  These CGIF operational policies are in conformity with all relevant operating policies of \nADB. There are, however, two important exceptions: (a) CGIF will not seek a \u201cno objection\u201d \nwaiver from the concerned Government prior to approving corporate guarantees; and (b) CGIF \nwill apply a full capital backing for outstanding guarantees as opposed to the new ADB policy of \nproviding capital backing based on the callable amount of those guarantees maturing in any \ngiven year4. \n \n                                                 \n2 Both the Philippine government and San Miguel Corporation are locally rated Aaa by Philratings, a local credit rating \nagency. \n3 The financial market defines investment grade as rating of \u2018BBB\u2019 and above from Standard and Poors, \u2018Baa\u2019 and \nabove from Moody\u2019s, and \u2018BBB\u2019 and above from Fitch. \n4 ADB, 2009. ", "56        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n8.  The Meeting of Contributors is the highest decision-making organ of CGIF. Among other \nthings, it determines CGIF\u2019s strategic objectives, approves the initial operational policies of \nCGIF, and reviews operations and financial performance5. \n \n9.  The  Board  of  Directors  represents  the  interest  of  the  Contributors.  The  Board  of \nDirectors leads, guides, and performs policy oversight of CGIF management6. Any revisions or \namendments to the operational policies must be approved by the Board of Directors, except \nthose related to CGIF country limits, CGIF\u2019s scope of business and CGIF\u2019s leverage ratio; in \nthese three reserved areas, the Board of Directors shall recommend changes for consideration \nby the Meeting of Contributors. \n                                                 \n5 The Chairperson of the Organizational Meeting/Annual Meeting of Contributors arranges for the Minutes of the \nMeetings to be taken. \n6 The Chairperson of the CGIF Board arranges for the Minutes of the Meetings to be taken. ", "Appendix 3  57 \nII.  The CGIF Board  \nA.  CGIF\u2019s Board of Directors \n10.  The Board of Directors has key responsibilities in the governance of CGIF. These are \nand must remain distinct from those of the other decision-making organs; namely, the Meeting \nof  Contributors  and  the  management  of  CGIF.  The  principle  responsibility  is  one  of  full \nstewardship. This involves oversight and supervision of management and the operations of \nCGIF and supports the clear delineation between the roles of the Board and the role and \nresponsibilities of the management. \n \n11.  The Board and each Board member must understand that the Board has no role in the \ndirect management of CGIF. That role rests with the management who is supervised by the \nBoard. It is essential that each director as a member of the Board is conversant with how he or \nshe will discharge the obligation of stewardship. Although the Board acts collectively, each \nindividual director has obligations which must be fully discharged. The following guidelines will \nassist directors in carrying out their duties in line with best practice in corporate governance and \nwith CGIF\u2019s AoA and all other regulations which may impact on performance. \n \n1.   Board composition \n \n12.  The Board of Directors will have a balance of professionally qualified directors such that \nthe Board\u2019s decision-making cannot be dominated by a single Contributor or small group.  \nContributor-appointed directors have a special responsibility to exercise independent judgment. \n \n13.  Directors other than the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) must be independent of the \nmanagement and should not have any other business interest or any other relationship that \ncould impact on their impartiality and objectivity. There will be an obligation on directors to \nensure that they have sufficient information to be able to assess issues fully. To assist the \nBoard of Directors, particularly with technical issues, an External Advisory Panel has been \nformulated to provide advice on all non-routine Board decisions. \n \n2.  Meetings \n \n14.  As directors are individually and collectively responsible for the decisions of the Board, \nthey must not only be professionally qualified to fully understand the financial operations of \nCGIF, but they must also be familiar with the conduct of the Board. It is a fundamental premise \nthat CGIF could not operate without the Board\u2019s leadership and guidance, hence the need for all \ndirectors to attend meetings and be ready and able to discuss pending issues. This enables \ndirectors to be aware of decisions that affect CGIF and all stakeholders. A member of the \nExternal Advisory Committee will also attend Board Meetings. \n \n15.  The Board meets at least once every quarter and at other times as required. \n \n16.  The duration of meetings will largely be determined by the agenda but directors must \nensure that meetings will not be simply \u2018rubber-stamping\u2019 mechanisms. Board meetings must \nundertake rigorous examination and inquiry into the activities of CGIF. \n ", "58        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n17.  To the extent possible there, 14 days\u2019 notice of meetings ust be provided to directors so \nthat they have sufficient time to prepare. \n \n18.  All directors must receive Board papers for each meeting and these papers should \ninclude: but not be limited to the following: \n \n(i)  an agenda; \n(ii)  minutes of the previous meeting; \n(iii)  the CEO\u2019s operational report; and \n(iv)  financial report. \n \n3.  Letter of appointment \n \n19.  The duties, rights and responsibilities of Board members should be specified in a letter \nissued  by  the  Chairperson  of  the  Board  as  soon  as  possible  after  the  nomination  of  the \ncandidate director. Once the candidate has confirmed his or her interests to the concerned \nContributor or Contributors in joining the Board, and the candidate has been formally elected by \nthe Meeting of Contributors, the incoming director should be given a Letter of Appointment from \nthe Chairperson of the Board to ensure that the candidate is fully aware of, and commits to \nfulfilling, the rights and responsibilities associated with Board membership.  \n \n20.  The letter of appointment will includes: \n \n(i)  the background to the appointment; \n(ii)  the formality of the appointment; \n(iii)  the basis of the director\u2019s role and the types of activities in which the \ndirector will be involved; \n(iv)  how  the  director  will  obtain  information  during  the  course  of  the \ndirectorship; \n(v)  an outline of the time commitment required of the director; \n(vi)  the fees payable, if any, and details of reimbursable expenses7; \n(vii)  a clear definition of the corporate governance structure and instruments \nwhich impact on the director\u2019s position. \n \n4.  Duties of Directors \n \n21.  Members of the Board of Directors are legally accountable for any breach of their duties. \nTheir rights and responsibilities are specified in CGIF\u2019s AoA and include: \n \n(i)  as the Board of Directors is not an executive body, its primary role is to \nrepresent and protect the interests of Contributors and CGIF through \nleading  and  guiding  policy  oversight  of  management.  Directors  are \nexpected to perform their duties in good faith and in a manner that they \nbelieve to be in the best interests of CGIF and its Contributors, This \nincludes the avoidance of any conflict of interest and the avoidance of \ncompetition with CGIF. There must be no misuse of CGIF\u2019s assets or \nimproper use of any powers conferred under the AoA. \n                                                 \n7 ADB as Trustee cannot pay Government officials fulfilling responsibilities as CGIF directors ", "Appendix 3  59 \n(ii)  The  Board  of  Directors  is  responsible  to  ensure  that  management \noperates  and  CGIF  as  a  whole  operates  in  full  compliance  with \ninternational best practices and with a focus on minimizing the inherent \nrisks in extending guarantees (and in making investments when permitted \nby the Meeting of Contributors) in the best interests of the Contributors \nand CGIF in full compliance of the AoA and these Operational Policies. \n(iii)  a duty of care to perform their duties with the degree of skill and care that \nmay be reasonably expected of a person holding such a position and not \nto act in a manner which is reckless or grossly negligent. \n(iv)  a duty to ensure that CGIF and its officers and staff comply with the \napplicable law and all relevant statutes , regulations, and policies. \n \n22.  All directors must express their opinions openly and honestly. Thoughtful discussion \namongst directors is encouraged. \n \n23.  The directors owe duties to CGIF and its Contributors. \n \na.  Duties to CGIF \n24.  In the discharge of their duties, directors must ensure that the functions of the Board \nhave been specified clearly and are well understood. Directors must recognize the importance \nof management and supervise the recruitment and retention of competent and well-qualified \nmanagement. \n \n25.  Directors must be aware of whom the key stakeholders are and must take into account \nthe interests of all stakeholders. Directors will recuse themselves from Board decisions on \nguarantee proposals from their own constituencies. \n \nb.  Duties to the Contributors \n26.  Every director must endeavor to ensure that CGIF is financially viable and well managed \nfor the protection and in the interests of the Contributors \n \n27.  The Board of Directors is accountable and reports to the Meeting of Contributors on the \noperations and performance of management and of CGIF. Strategic decisions of the Meeting of \nContributors must be fully and efficiently implemented. \n \nc.  Duty of care \n28.  Directors must ensure that they are in a position to guide and monitor the management of \nCGIF. In order to do this, there are standards that must be achieved. These include: \n \n(i)  directors must be familiar with the fundamentals of CGIF\u2019s business; \n \n(ii)  directors have a continuing obligation to keep themselves informed about \nthe activities of CGIF; \n ", "60        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n(iii)  directors are not required to undertake inspection of day-to-day activities \nbut  are  required  to  engage  in  general  monitoring  and  supervision  of \nCGIF\u2019s  business  affairs.  Accordingly,  directors  must  ensure  that \nmanagement are following the policies developed by the Board; and \n \n(iv)  directors are not required to audit CGIF\u2019s financial statements but must \nmaintain familiarity with the financial status of CGIF by a regular review of \nfinancial statements. \n \n29.  There are a number of ways in which a director of CGIF can meet the general duty of \ncare and the more specific duties outlined above. \n \nd.  Delegation \n30.  The  Board  of  Directors  delegates  most  administrative  functions  to  the  management \nwithin CGIF. The principal delegation is to the CEO and the Board of Directors must ensure that \nit fully documents the activities and responsibilities which are delegated to the CEO. When \nsubstantial  experience  has  been  gained  with  the  recommendations  of  the  Guarantee  and \nInvestment Committee, the Board may delegate approval of certain operations such as small \nscale guarantees to the decision of the Guarantee and Investment Committee \n \n31.  The Board of Directors also delegates responsibilities to Board Committees. The initial \nTerms of Reference of the Board of Directors Committees will be adopted by the Meeting of \nContributors. Subsequent changes will be through resolutions of the Board of Directors. Where \nDirectors are members of Board Committees, they must be aware that the legal duties of \ndirectors still apply. As wll as carrying out any specific responsibilities under the terms of \nreference of a particular Committee there must be strict adherence to the duties of loyalty and \ncare. \n \ne.  Standard of Care \n32.  The duty of care owed by directors means that they must exhibit behavior to a particular \nstandard.  The  duty  of  care  and  whether  directors  have  discharged  this  duty  will  be \nbenchmarked against the standard of the ordinary prudent and diligent individual in similar \ncircumstances. This means that directors of CGIF are required to be vigilant in identifying any \ndishonest activities, incompetence or errors by management. This requires that directors take \nan active role in supervision. \n \n33.  Directors must be familiar with all laws and regulations which regulate or affect CGIF. \nThe directors must also be familiar with CGIF\u2019s general practices and financial condition by \nregularly  reviewing  all relevant  financial  and  performance  related  materials  which  must  be \npresented to them by management. \n \n34.  Directors do not need to be familiar with minor management details but do need to be \nfamiliar with material issues which are of direct relevance to the effectiveness of CGIF. To \nensure that problems are identified, directors must be aware of warning signals which might \nindicate that there are problems with the management of CGIF and must be prepared to \ninvestigate  such  problems.  This  may  involve  obtaining  outside  professional  advice  or \nundertaking detailed questioning of management. \n ", "Appendix 3  61 \nf.  Information \n35.  In  discharging  their  duty  of  care,  directors  will  need  to  ensure  that  they  receive \nappropriate information of the necessary quality and in timely manner on which to base their \ndecisions.  In  general,  management  must  provide  CGIF\u2019s  transactions  commonly  involve \nsubstantial risk. Directors must ensure that (a) they balance potential benefits for CGIF against \nforeseeable risk factors; (b) they have no personal interest in the transaction; (c) they are well \ninformed  about  the  subject  matter  of  the  decision;  and  (d)  they  honestly  believe  that  the \nproposed decision is in the best interests of CGIF based on the available information as well as \non the advice of the External Advisory Panel. The external and internal auditors of CGIF will be \nappointed by the Board of Directors based upon the recommendation of the Chair of the Audit \nCommittee of the Board. Although a Director should be able to rely on the information provided \nby management and by the external and internal auditors, further inquiries or further information \nmay be required in addition to the advice of the External Advisory Panel before a fully informed \ndecision can be made. This will certainly be the case where it is a major or material transaction \nin which CGIF may be involved. When relying on information received the Director\u2019s reliance \nmust be in good faith and he or she must have reasonable grounds for believing that the \ninformation is correct. \n \n36.  CGIF\u2019s transactions commonly involve substantial risk. Directors must ensure that (a) \nthey balance potential benefits for CGIF against foreseeable risk factors; (b) they have no \npersonal interest in the transaction; (c) they are well informed about the subject matter of the \ndecision; and (d) they honestly believe that the proposed decision is in the best interests of \nCGIF. The Chief Risk Officer will be appointed by the Board of Directors based upon the \nrecommendation of Chair of the Internal Control and Risk Management Committee  \n \n37.  The information directors receive while discharging their duties shall remain confidential \nto CGIF. It must not be used by directors for personal gain and must not be disseminated to \noutside groups unless approved by the Board of Directors. \n \ng.  Duty of loyalty (and conflicts of interest) \n38.  A fundamental duty of directors is one of loyalty to CGIF. This requires that directors act \nin the best interests of CGIF and do not allow any personal or professional interest to conflict \nwith their duty. A failure to satisfy this obligation will result in a failure by the Director to achieve \nan effective discharge of their duty. \n \n39.  The personal interests of Directors and their families must not be allowed to prevail over \nthose of CGIF and its Contributors. Directors must therefore make full disclosure to the Board of  \nDirectors of any potentially conflicting interest in any other entity or transaction. As part of the \nduty of loyalty, a Director must not initiate a guarantee operation to compete against CGIF. This \nprecludes a director from operating any business which may be similar to CGIF. \n \n40.  The Director after becoming aware of the fact that he or she has or may have an interest \nin a transaction or proposed transaction with CGIF, must disclose to the Board the nature and  \nmonetary value of the interest. If the monetary value of the interest cannot be quantified, the \ndirector must disclose the nature and extent of the interest. The director shall be disqualified \nfrom the discussion and the voting on the transaction. The director shall disclose the interest as \nsoon as he or she gains knowledge of the interest and subsequent conflict of interest. As a \nroutine matter, directors will recuse themselves from Board decisions on guarantee proposals \nfrom their own constituiency. ", "62        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n \n41.  A director must be alert to the possible conflict of interest which may arise between the \ninterests of management and the duties of Directors. \n \nh.  Specific duties of the Board of Directors \n42.  The Board of Directors has specific duties, as provided in Article 8.2 of the AoA, to review \nand ensure timely fulfillment of business plans, budgets and other financial and operational \nmatters to be executed by management, and which include but are not limited to: \n \n(i)  recommending to the Meeting of Contributors the appointment and terms \nand conditions of service of the CEO; \n(ii)  recommending to the Trustee for formal endorsement the appointment \nand termination of other Executive Staff; \n(iii)  recommending to the Meeting of Contributors the appointment and terms \nof engagement of the external auditor; \n(iv)  reviewing  the  operations  and  financial  performance  of  CGIF  and, \nproviding general advice to the CEO and other senior management on \nstrategic objectives and issues regarding the operation of CGIF; \n(v)  reviewing  and  approving  the  Annual  Business  Plan  and  the  Annual \nBudget for the forthcoming Fiscal Year as prepared by the CEO;   \n(vi)  recommending to the Meeting of Contributors (a) the commencement and \nthe  extent  of  investment  operations  that  CGIF  may  undertake  for \ndevelopment  of  the  bond  markets;  (b)  the  use  of  leverage  and  any \nsubsequent decision on the maximum leverage ratio together with the  \nplans for acquiring the needed reinsurance; (c) any revision to the country \nlimits in CGIF operations as set out in the CGIF Operational Policies; \n(vii)  approving  any  other  revision  or  amendment  to  the  CGIF  Terms  of \nReference for the Board of Directors and Board Committees and the \nCGIF Operational Policies; \n(viii)  reviewing  and  approving  the  Annual  Business  Plan  and  the  Annual \nBudget for the forthcoming Fiscal Year prepared by the CEO; \n(ix)  preparing the Annual Report  for the preceding Fiscal Year for review and \napproval by the Meeting of Contributors; \n(x)  recommending to the Meeting of Contributors the allocation of the net \nincome of CGIF for the preceding Fiscal Year to the reserves and/or the \ndistribution of any surplus to the Contributors; \n(xi)  ensuring  that  robust  systems  of  accounting,  financial  management, \ninternal controls, risk management and internationally competitive human \nresource policies (including remuneration) are in place and functioning \neffectively; ", "Appendix 3  63 \n(xii)  ensuring that the operations of CGIF comply at all times with the CGIF \nOperational Policies and all applicable ADB Operational Policies; \n(xiii)  approving all guarantee and investment transactions; \n(xiv)  fulfilling the duties of the Trustee which have been delegated pursuant to \nArticle 10.3.2 of the AoA; \n(xv)  taking any other action as may be required in the best interests of CGIF, \nother than those reserved to the Meeting of Contributors and the Trustee, \nunder the AoA; and \n(xvi)  consulting  the  External  Advisory  Panel  for  impartial  professional  and \nspecialized advice to assist in fulfilling the Board\u2019s responsibilities. \n5.  Functions of the Board \n \n43.  One of the key functions of the Board is to set policy and formulate CGIF\u2019s strategy. The \nBoard must ensure that: \n \n(i)  there are clearly established strategies for achieving CGIF\u2019s objectives; \n(ii)  there is an appropriate monitoring system to check that the strategies are \nbeing effected; and  \n(iii)  the strategies of CGIF are reviewed regularly, in line with indications from \nthe Meeting of Contributors, any performance deviations from \nexpectations that require appropriate changes to the strategy as adopted. \n44.  CGIF\u2019s strategy defines the long-term goals of CGIF and the operational approaches for \nachieving those goals. These goals and operational approaches are reflected in the detailed \nBusiness Plan which will be prepared by the CEO in consultation with the Executive Committee \n(the  Management)  \u2013  the  Executive  Committee  comprises  the  CEO,  the  Vice-President  of \nOperations, the Chief Risk Officer, the Chief Finance Officer and the General Counsel. The \nBoard must have considered and approved the detailed Business Plan and internal rating \nsystem prior to consideration of the first guarantee for approval.The Management of CGIF is \nresponsible  for  implementing  the  business  plan.  The  Board  will  monitor  the  degree  of \ncompliance with the business plan. If there are difficulties in meeting objectives of the business \nplan, the Management will inform the Board of Directors as soon as possible. This will enable \nthe Board of Directors to recommend or take appropriate corrective action. \n \n45.  The  Board  of  Directors  has  a  corresponding  responsibility  to  design  appropriate \noperational policies for CGIF. In the fulfillment of these responsibilities, the Board of Directors \nwill request the Management to prepare draft operational policies or amendments for their \nconsideration. The operational policies cover a wide range of activities within CGIF. These \nareas of operational policy include but are not limited to: \n \n(i)  terms of reference and personnel and administration, including that of the \nBoard of Directors; \n ", "64        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n(ii)  remuneration of management (on the recommendation of the Nomination \nand Remuneration Committee); \n(iii)  financial reporting and disclosure; and \n(iv)  delegation of Board powers to  the CEO, the CRO and other members of \nmanagement. \n46.  The Board has a duty to ensure that all CGIF policies are published and readily available \nto affected parties (e.g. Contributors, employees, bond guarantee issuers). The Board ensures \nthat all policies are complied with and that the CEO provides a regular report on the extent of \ncompliance. The Board of Directors regularly reviews all policies and has a formal process for \namending policy when it is in the interests of CGIF. \n \n6.  Training and development \n \n47.  All newly appointed Directors should receive sufficient induction training and support to \nensure they are aware of their responsibilities as Directors of CGIF. This training takes place as \nsoon as possible after the Director\u2019s appointment. As Directors\u2019 obligations commence from the \ndate of the appointment, he or she must be in a position to make an effective contribution to the \nBoard and to CGIF from that date. \n \n48.  The induction training is conducted within the framework of a formally established system \nwithin CGIF and the responsibility for training will rest with the Chairperson of the Board. \n \n49.  Induction training will incorporate the following: \n \n(i)  CGIF\u2019s supporting documentation including CGIF\u2019s AoA; \n(ii)  the Board\u2019s mode of operation, including details of all meeting protocol; \n(iii)  the duties and specific functions of directors; \n(iv)  all rules which relate to conflict of interest; \n(v)  the Board\u2019s structure and functions; \n(vi)  CGIF\u2019s activities;  \n(vii)  international best practice in corporate governance; and \n(viii)  any outstanding material issues with which the Board may be concerned. \n50.  In the course of the induction training newly appointed Directors should become familiar \nwith the following: \n \n(i)  CGIF\u2019s annual report; \n \n(ii)  CGIF\u2019s corporate strategy and business plan; \n \n(iii)  Board minutes of earlier meetings; ", "Appendix 3  65 \n \n(iv)  biographical and contact details of all Directors; and \n \n(v)  the corporate governance structure and process of CGIF. \n51.  Directors will receive regular training in order to maintain currency and acquire additional \nskills.  This  on-going  training  could  include  internal  courses  or  through  the  attendance  of \ndirectors at external courses. \n \n7.  Chairperson \u2013 Appointment and Duties \n \n52.  The Board of Directors\u2019 tasks and responsibilities in running the Board on the one hand, \nand in governance of CGIF\u2019s business on the other hand, are met by keeping the roles of Board \nChairperson and the CEO separate, and by achieving a balance of power and authority within \nthe Board of Directors such that no one individual has excessive powers or influence. The \nChairperson of the Board of Directors is professionally qualified with a degree in business, \nfinance, or equivalent at the Master\u2019s level (such as Master of Business Administration) and \nsubstantial experience in the financial industry within ASEAN+3 to ensure that the management \nof financial risks is well understood at the Board level. As the Chairperson of the Board also \nserves as the Chairperson of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Chairperson \nalso has professional experience in developing and implementing recruitment, remuneration \nand evaluation policies at a senior level in the financial industry of ASEAN+3.  \n \n53.  The  Chairperson  is  selected  at  each  third  Annual  Meeting  of  Contributors  on \nrecommendations of the Board of Directors8. \n \n54.  The primary concern of the Chairperson is to ensure that the Board of Directors acts \neffectively and efficiently in its leadership, supervision and oversight of CGIF. The Chairperson \nhas the following duties include but is not limited to the following: \n \n(i)  ensuring that the Board is participating in establishing the strategy and \npolicy of CGIF; \n \n(ii)  ensuring that the Board reviews the human resources of CGIF; \n \n(iii)  developing the Board Agenda; \n \n(iv)  facilitating appropriate conduct at Board meetings; \n \n(v)  chairing Board meetings; \n \n(vi)  ensuring the Board and senior management undergoes a regular 360 \ndegree evaluation process; \n \n(vii)  monitoring the degree of training and development by the Board and \nensuring that new directors receive induction training; \n \n                                                 \n8 Initially, the Chairperson will be selected by the Contributors from the directors elected at the Organizational \nMeeting. ", "66        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n(viii)  making sure the Board is receiving the information required to enable it to \nmake informed decisions; \n \n(ix)  developing and maintaining an appropriate relationship with the CEO. \nThe Chairperson provides the link between the Board and management; \nand \n \n(x)  ensuring that there is a regular review of the CEO\u2019s performance. The \nChairperson will lead the process of evaluation of the CEO. \n8.  Appointment of the CEO and Evaluation of the CEO \n \n55.  The Board of Directors is required to fulfill the function of recommending a CEO for CGIF \nfor approval of the Meeting of Contributors. This is important because the CEO is responsible \nfor ensuring the performance of management and the fulfillment of the Board\u2019s strategy. The \nCEO provides a fundamental link between the Board and the management. This \u2018gatekeeper\u2019 \nrole maintains the independence of the Board and its stewardship role. An effective CEO will \nprevent any merger of duties and responsibilities between these two key divisions within CGIF. \n \n56.  The Board and the CEO must work together to build a professional relationship which \nprovides  for  a  free  flow  of  information  between  the  two  divisions  of  CGIF.  The  CEO\u2019s \nresponsibilities, as provided in Article 9.1 of the AoA, include but are not be limited to: \n \n(i)  developing and negotiating the employment terms and conditions for \nCGIF executives and recommending appointments (and terminations) of \nexecutives to the Board of Directors; appointment (and terminations) of all \nother professional staff and consultants are to be made directly to the \nTrustee; \n \n(ii)  carrying out the day to day management of CGIF; \n \n(iii)  managing the day-to-day operations of CGIF in accordance with the \nAnnual Budget and the Annual Business Plan; \n \n(iv)  ensuring that all personnel act with a high degree of honesty and integrity \nand comply with any Code of Conduct or Code of Ethics which CGIF may \nsupport; \n \n(v)  providing strong leadership and effective management; \n \n(vi)  carrying out all tasks which may formally be delegated by the Board; \n \n(vii)  ensuring the Board is kept informed of the activities of CGIF; \n \n(viii)  assisting the Board to achieve its strategic goals; and \n \n(ix)  monitoring the compliance with policies established by the Board. \n \n57.  Based on terms of selection of the CEO as approved by the Meeting of Contributors, the \nBoard's Nomination and Remuneration Committee is responsible for drafting a suitable contract \nwhich must be signed by the Trustee and accepted by the CEO designate. The Contract must ", "Appendix 3  67 \ndefine  the  role  of  the  CEO  and  the  terms  and  conditions  of  service  together  with  the \nremuneration and the evaluation process. \n \n58.  The Board must conduct a regular 360 degree evaluation of the CEO. The key issues of \nthe evaluation are: \n \n(i)  the integrity of the CEO and the degree of leadership provided by the \nCEO; \n \n(ii)  the extent to which the CEO has met the strategic objectives of CGIF and \nany key performance indicators for the CEO that may be included in the \nservice contract; \n \n(iii)  the ability of the CEO to assist the Board in developing a succession plan; \n \n(iv)  the extent to which the CEO has developed a relationship with other \nstakeholders of CGIF; and \n \n(v)  the relationship between the Board and the CEO. \n \n59.  The Board of Directors must also design a formal evaluation process for the CEO. This \nprocess will be developed in consultation with the CEO of the Trustee and must be established \nbefore any evaluation takes place. However, the CEO can only be removed from office by the \nBoard of Directors. A resolution to remove the CEO requires a majority of votes by Board \nmembers to be adopted. Grounds for removal of the CEO shall include serious misconduct, \npoor performance and/or failure to comply with any standards and terms of service that may be \nspecified in the employment contract. The employment contract shall include the terms and \nconditions of removal and, if applicable, any compensation. \n \n60.  Based upon the recommendation of the Board of Directors, the removal is effected by the \nTrustee. \n \nB.  CGIF AUDIT COMMITTEE \n61.  CGIF\u2019s Board of Directors will have an Audit Committee tasked with oversight, due \ndiligence and control over the financial aspects of CGIF's operations and performance. The \nAudit Committee will be able to take independent (outside) professional advice when necessary \nand have an agreed procedure for doing so. \n \n62.  The Audit Committee is to be composed of three Board of Director members that are \nprofessionally  qualified.  The  Chairperson  of  the  Audit  Committee  must  be  qualified  in \naccounting and auditing work and the other members of the Audit Committee must be able to \nunderstand and be familiar with the nature and meaning of the balance sheet, the income \nstatement and the cash flow statements as these relate to understanding CGIF\u2019s performance. \n \n63.  The Audit Committee, in conjunction with the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, \nrecommend to the Board of Directors a candidate for Internal Auditor, and supervises the \nactivities of the Internal Auditor. \n ", "68        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n64.  The Audit Committee is provided by the Board of Directors, the Internal Auditor, the \nexternal auditors, and the management with all the relevant information to enable it to perform \nits duties effectively. \n \n65.  The members of the Audit Committee must all be members of the Board of Directors. \nThe Chairperson of the Audit Committee must be qualified in accounting and auditing work and \nthe other members of the Audit Committee must be able to understand and be familiar with the \nnature and meaning of the balance sheet, the income statement and the cash flow statements \nas these relate to understanding CGIF\u2019s performance. \n \n1.   Purpose of the Audit Committee \n \n66.  The  purpose  of  the  Audit  Committee  is  to  assist  the  Board  to  fulfill  its  corporate \ngovernance and oversight responsibilities with particular reference to CGIF\u2019s financial reporting \nand the internal and external audit functions. Its primary role is to ensure: \n \n(i)  the integrity of financial reporting; \n(ii)  an effective audit process that involves, among other things, effective and \nstructured  lines  for  internal  audit  and  financial  reporting,  and  the \nindependence, objectivity and thoroughness of the external audit; \n(iii)  the  effectiveness  of  internal  controls  to  ensure  proper  and  effective \napplication of resources, and compliance with regulations and business \nprocedures; \n(iv)  effective dialogue among Board members, management and auditors; \nand \n(v)  the culture and practice of effective oversight and ethical standards are \nfostered within CGIF. \n67.  The Audit Committee performs a critical role in underpinning the assurance that the \nBoard gives to the Contributors as to the integrity of CGIF\u2019s audit and internal control processes. \nIf things go wrong, the Audit Committee has a role in ensuring that they are corrected. The Audit \nCommittee also serves as a forum where Board Directors, management and auditors can \naddress issues relating to the management of risk and financial reporting. \n \n68.  The Board reviews the Audit Committee's effectiveness annually. \n \n69.  Given the importance of the Audit Committee in the Board\u2019s function of oversight and of \nenhancing accountability to Contributors, the work of the Audit Committee is communicated to \nContributors. The Directors\u2019 Report will therefore contain a separate section that describes the \nrole and responsibilities of the Audit Committee and the actions taken by the Committee to \ndischarge its responsibilities. The Audit Committee section in the Directors\u2019 Report includes the \nfollowing information: \n \n(i)  a summary of the role of the Audit Committee and a brief description of its \nterms of reference; \n ", "Appendix 3  69 \n(ii)  names and qualifications of all members of the Audit Committee during \nthe period; \n \n(iii)  the  number  of  Audit  Committee  meetings  and  attendance  by  each \nmember; and \n \n(iv)  a  report  by  the  Audit  Committee  on  its  findings,  and  discharge  its \nresponsibilities. \n \n70.  The Chairperson of the Audit Committee will be present at the Meeting of Contributors to \nanswer questions, through the Chairperson of the Board, on the report on the Audit Committee's \nactivities and matters within the scope of Audit Committee's responsibilities. \n \n2.   Membership of the Audit Committee \n \n71.  The Audit Committee has at least three members who will be formally appointed by the \nBoard, based on the recommendation of the Board\u2019s Nomination and Remuneration Committee. \nAny changes in membership can only be made by the Board in consultation with the Nomination \nand Remuneration Committee. The Chairperson of the Board of Directors is not a member of \nthe Audit Committee. \n \n72.  Members must have the appropriate financial knowledge and skills, and time, to fulfill \ntheir role on the Committee. The majority of members must have adequate experience in \nfinancial and business matters relevant to the business of CGIF. At least one member of the \nAudit Committee must have significant, recent and relevant financial experience, for example as \nan auditor or as a Finance Director of a financial institution. \n \n73.  The  Board  appoints  a  member  of  the  Committee  who  has  extensive  experience  in \nfinancial  analysis  and/or  accounting  and  audit  as  the  Chairperson  of  the  Committee.  The \nappointment is for up to three years, extendable by no more than two additional three-year \nperiods. Membership of the Committee is regularly rotated, with at least one member or the \nCommittee being replaced every two years. \n \n74.  CGIF provides an induction program for new Audit Committee members. This will cover \nthe  role  of  the  Audit  Committee,  including  its  Terms  of  Reference  and  expected  time \ncommitment by members; and an overview of CGIF's business, identifying the main business \nand financial dynamics and risks. It will also include meeting CGIF management and relevant \nstaff. \n \n75.  New members of the Committee will be provided with a copy of the Committee\u2019s Terms \nof Reference and with specific, tailored information about CGIF in the following areas (in so far \nas these information have not been provided to them in their capacity as Board members): \n \n(i)  Business operations; \n \n(ii)  Financial performance; \n \n(iii)  Internal control system; \n \n(iv)  Risk management system; \n ", "70        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n(v)  Key financial reporting procedures and policies, including related-party \nissues; \n \n(vi)  Internal audit functions and accounting policies; \n \n(vii)  Legal and regulatory requirements, and other compliance responsibilities; \n \n(viii)  Financial and other reporting both internally and to outside bodies; \n \n(ix)  Code of Ethics; and \n \n(x)  Unusual and off balance-sheet transactions. \n \n76.  Where  necessary,  members  will  be  given  the  opportunity  and  resources  to  attend \ntechnical and professional training to help them upgrade their skills and knowledge in financial, \naccounting, legal and other relevant issues. Training will be provided on an ongoing and timely \nbasis and will include an understanding of the principles of and developments in financial \nreporting,  understanding  financial  statements,  applicable  accounting  standards  and \nrecommended practice; the regulatory framework for CGIF's business; the role of internal and \nexternal auditing and risk management. Training may take various forms, such as attendance at \nformal courses and conferences, internal company talks and seminars, and briefings by external \nadvisers. \n \n3.   Responsibilities of the Audit Committee \n \n77.  The main role and responsibilities of the Audit Committee in CGIF are to: \n \n(i)  Monitor  and  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  financial  statements  of  and \nfinancial reporting by CGIF; \n \n(ii)  Monitor,  review  and  when  necessary,  make  recommendations  to \nstrengthen, the effectiveness of CGIF\u2019s internal audit function; \n \n(iii)  Make recommendations to the Board on the appointment of the external \nauditor, determine the terms of reference and engagement of the external \naudit  and  approve  the  remuneration  of  the  external  auditor  following \nappointment  by  the  Meeting  of  Contributors,  unless  a  competitive \nselection process has been effected with the approval of the Meeting of \nContributors; \n \n(iv)  Monitor,  review  and  ensure  the  external  auditor\u2019s  independence, \nobjectivity and effectiveness, and ensure that the external auditor is not \nengaged to supply any non-audit or other consultancy services to CGIF; \n \n(v)  Ensure the application of appropriate international accounting policies, \ncompliance with business policies and practices, and compliance with \napplicable  laws,  regulations,  standards  and  best  financial  practice \nguidelines; \n \n(vi)  Monitor and ensure compliance with CGIF\u2019s\u2019 policies on related party \ntransactions; and ", "Appendix 3  71 \n \n(vii)  Provide  a  formal  forum  for  communication  between  the  Board, \nmanagement and auditors. \n \n78.  The Audit Committee\u2019s monitoring and review of the effectiveness of CGIF\u2019s internal \naudit functions will be conducted on a regular basis. Where the Audit Committee finds cause for \nconcern or scope for improvements, it will make recommendations to the Board on the action \nneeded to address the issue. \n \n79.  Where there is disagreement between the Audit Committee and the Board, adequate \ntime  will  be  made  available  for  discussion  of  the  issue  with  a  view  to  resolving  the \ndisagreement. Where disagreements cannot be resolved, the Audit Committee has the right to \nreport the issue to the Meeting of Contributors as part of the report on its activities in the \nDirectors' Report. \n \n80.  The Audit Committee will have explicit authority to investigate any matters within its terms \nof reference, the resources for doing so and full access to available information. It will also be \nempowered to obtain outside professional, specialist advice. The Audit Committee reviews \nannually its Terms of Reference and its own effectiveness and recommends any necessary \nchanges to the Board. \n \n4.  Ensuring Integrity of Financial Reporting \n \n81.  The Audit Committee will review the significant financial reporting issues and judgments \nmade  in  connection  with  the  preparation  of  CGIF's  financial  statements,  interim  reports, \npreliminary announcements and related formal statements. The Audit Committee also reviews \nthe clarity and completeness of disclosures in the financial statements. \n \n82.  It  is  the  Management's  responsibility  to  prepare  complete  and  accurate  financial \nstatements and disclosures in accordance with international financial reporting standards and \napplicable international accounting rules and regulations. However, the Audit Committee will \nconsider significant accounting policies, any changes to them and any significant estimates and \njudgments. \n \n83.  The Management will inform the Audit Committee of the methods used to account for \nsignificant  or  unusual  transactions  where  the  accounting  treatment  is  open  to  differing \napproaches. \n \n84.  Taking  into  account  the  external  auditor's  view,  the  Audit  Committee  will  consider \nwhether  CGIF  has  adopted  appropriate  accounting  and  reporting  policies  and,  where \nnecessary, made appropriate estimates and judgments. \n \n85.  The  Audit  Committee  reviews  the  financial  reporting  and  considers  whether  the \ndisclosures made are set properly in context. If, following its review, the Audit Committee is not \nsatisfied with any aspect of the proposed financial reporting by CGIF, it shall report its views to \nthe Board. \n \n86.  The Audit Committee reviews related information presented with the financial statements, \nincluding the operating and financial review, and corporate governance statements relating to \naudit and risk management. \n ", "72        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n87.  Similarly, where Board approval is required for other statements containing financial \ninformation  (for  example,  summary  financial  statements,  significant  financial  returns  to \nregulators  and  release  of  price  sensitive  information),  whenever  practicable  the  Audit \nCommittee reviews such statements first. \n \n88.  Except to the extent that this is expressly dealt with by the Board or the Internal Control \nand Risk Management Committee, the Audit Committee reviews and approves the statements \nincluded in the Annual Report in relation to internal financial control and the management of \nrisk. \n \n89.  The Audit Committee establishes and periodically reviews arrangements by which staff of \nCGIF may, in confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in matters of financial \nreporting, financial control or any other matters. The Committee ensures that arrangements are \nin place for the proportionate and independent investigation of such matters and for appropriate \nfollow-up action, and that any matters relevant to its own responsibilities are brought to its \nattention. \n \n5.   Ensuring Effectiveness of Internal Audit Process \n \n90.  The Audit Committee reviews and approves the internal audit function's remit, having \nregard to the complementary roles of the internal and external audit functions. It ensures that \nthe function has the necessary resources and access to information to enable it to fulfill its \nmandate, and is equipped to perform in accordance with appropriate professional standards for \ninternal auditors. \n \n91.  The Audit Committee is also responsible for the selection of CGIF\u2019s Internal Auditor. \nBased on the advice of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee, the Audit Committee has  \nprimary responsibility for making a recommendation on the appointment, reappointment and \nremoval of the Internal Auditor to the Board for their approval. The Internal Auditor will report to \nthe Chair of the Audit Committee. \n \n92.  In its review of the work of the internal audit function, the Audit Committee must, among \nother things: \n \n(i)  Ensure  that  the  Internal  Auditor  has  direct  access  to  the  Board \nChairperson and to the Audit Committee and is accountable to the Audit \nCommittee; \n \n(ii)  Review and assess the annual internal audit work plan; \n \n(iii)  Receive a report on the results of the Internal Auditors' work on a periodic \nbasis; \n \n(iv)  Review and monitor the management's responsiveness to the Internal \nAuditor's findings and recommendations; \n \n(v)  Meet with the Internal Auditor several times a year without the presence \nof  management  to  develop  an  appropriate  plan  and  monitor  its \ndevelopment; and \n ", "Appendix 3  73 \n(vi)  Monitor  and  assess  the  role  and  effectiveness  of  the  internal  audit \nfunction in the overall context of CGIF's risk management system. \n \n6.   Ensuring Effectiveness of the External Audit Process \n \n93.  The Audit Committee is the body responsible for overseeing CGIF\u2019s relations with the \nexternal  auditor  and  has  primary  responsibility  for  making  a  recommendation  on  the \nappointment, reappointment and removal of the external auditors. This recommendation will be \nmade to the Board and thence to the Meeting of Contributors for their approval. If the Board \ndoes not accept the Audit Committee's recommendation, it includes in the Directors' Report a \nstatement from the Audit Committee explaining its recommendation and set out reasons why \nthe Board has taken a different position. \n \n94.  The Audit Committee's recommendation to the Board will be based on the assessments \nreferred to below. If the Audit Committee recommends the selection of possible new appointees \nas external auditors, it will oversee the selection process. This may involve competitive selection \nfrom a technically approved panel of external auditors. \n \n95.  The Audit Committee assesses the qualification, expertise and resources, effectiveness \nand independence of the external auditors annually. The assessment will cover all aspects of \nthe audit service provided by the audit firm, and include obtaining a report on the audit firm's \nown internal quality control procedures. \n \n96.  The Audit Committee\u2019s Section of the Directors\u2019 Report in the Annual Report explains to \nContributors how  CGIF\u2019s external  audit process and policy provide  adequate protection of \nauditor independence. \n \n97.  If the external auditor resigns, the Audit Committee investigates the issues giving rise to \nsuch resignation and consider whether any action is required. \n \n98.  The Audit Committee approves the terms of engagement and the remuneration to be \npaid to the External Auditor in respect of audit services provided. It reviews and agrees on the \nengagement letter issued by the external auditor at the start of each audit, ensuring that it has \nbeen updated to reflect changes in circumstances arising since the previous year. The scope of \nthe external audit is reviewed by the Audit Committee with the auditor. If the Audit Committee is \nnot satisfied as to its adequacy it requests additional work to be undertaken. \n \n99.  The Audit Committee satisfies itself that the level of fee payable in respect of the audit \nservices provided is appropriate and that an effective audit can be conducted for such a fee. \n \n100.  The Audit Committee has procedures to ensure the independence and objectivity of the \nexternal  auditor  annually,  taking  into  consideration  relevant  professional  and  regulatory \nrequirements. \n \n101.  The Audit Committee seeks reassurance that the auditors and their staff have no family, \nfinancial, employment, investment or business relationship with CGIF (other than in the normal \ncourse of business). \n \n102.  The Audit Committee seeks from the audit firm, on an annual basis, information about \npolicies and processes for maintaining independence and monitoring compliance with relevant \nrequirements, including current requirements regarding the rotation of audit partners and staff. ", "74        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n \n103.  The Audit Committee monitors the external audit firm's compliance with applicable ethical \nguidance relating to the rotation of audit partners, the level of fees that CGIF pays in proportion \nto the overall fee income of the audit firm, office and partner and other related regulatory \nrequirements. \n \n104.  At the start of each annual audit cycle, the Audit Committee ensures that appropriate \nplans are in place for the audit. It considers whether the external auditor\u2019s work plan \u2013 including \nplanned  levels  of  materiality,  proposed  resources  and  levels  of  seniority,  expertise  and \nexperience  of  the  audit  teams  \u2013  are  consistent  with  the  scope  and  terms  of  the  audit \nengagement.. \n \n105.  The Audit Committee, together with the External Auditor, will among other things: \n \n(i)  Discuss  the major issues that arose during the course of the audit and \nwhich issues have and have not been resolved; \n \n(ii)  Review key accounting and audit judgments; and \n \n(iii)  Review levels of errors that may have been identified during the audit, \nobtaining the explanations from management and where necessary, from \nthe External Auditor, as to why certain errors might remain unadjusted. \n \n106.  The Audit Committee also reviews the audit representation letters before signature by \nmanagement and consider matters where representation has been requested on non-standard \nissues. The Committee considers whether the information provided is complete and appropriate \nbased on its own knowledge. \n \n107.  As part of its on-going monitoring process, the Audit Committee reviews the management \nletter  (or  equivalent)  and  reviews  and  monitors  the  management\u2019s  responsiveness  to  the \nExternal Auditor\u2019s findings and recommendations. \n \n108.  At the end of the audit cycle, the Audit Committee evaluates the effectiveness of the audit \nprocess. It will: \n \n(i)  Review whether the External Auditor has met the agreed audit plan and \nunderstand the reasons for any changes, including changes in perceived \naudit risks and the work undertaken by the external auditor to address \nthose risks; \n \n(ii)  Consider the robustness and perceptiveness of the external auditors in \ntheir handling of key accounting and audit judgments identified, and in \ntheir  responses  to  questions  from  the  Audit  Committee,  and  in  their \ncommentary where appropriate on the adequacy and effectiveness of the \nsystems of internal control and risk management; \n \n(iii)  Obtains  feedback  about  the  conduct  of  the  audit  from  key  persons \ninvolved, such as the Chief Finance Officer (CFO), the Internal Auditor \nand management; \n ", "Appendix 3  75 \n(iv)  Reviews and monitors the content of the External Auditor\u2019s management \nletter, to assess whether it is based on a good understanding of CGIF\u2019s \nbusiness and establish whether recommendations have been acted upon, \nand if not, the reasons; and \n \n(v)  Review  responsibilities  of  the  Internal  Auditor,  responsibilities  of  the \nExternal  Auditor,  off-balance  sheet  assets  and  liabilities  in  financial \nstatements (leasing, special purpose entities, joint ventures, partnerships, \netc.), financial assets and liabilities (historic cost vs. current fair value), \npro forma earnings vs. GAAP-based earnings. \n \n7.  Meetings, Procedures and Resources \n \n109.  The Audit Committee meets at least once every quarter, to coincide with key dates within \nthe financial reporting and audit cycles. But there will be as many meetings as the Audit \nCommittee's role and responsibilities require. Sufficient time for Committee meetings will be \nscheduled to enable the Committee to undertake as full a discussion as may be required. \n \n110.  A  sufficient  interval  is  allowed  between  Audit  Committee  meetings  and  main  Board \nmeetings to allow any work arising from the Audit Committee meeting to be carried out and \nreported to the Board as appropriate. \n \n111.  No  one  other  than  the  Audit  Committee's  members  and  a  member  of  the  External \nAdvisory Panel is entitled to be present at a meeting of the Audit Committee. It is for the Audit \nCommittee to decide if non-members will be invited to attend for a particular meeting or a \nparticular agenda item. It is to be expected that the external audit lead partner will be invited \nregularly to attend meetings as well as CGIF\u2019s CFO. \n \n112.  At least once a year, the Audit Committe meets the External and Internal Auditors, \nwithout management, to discuss issues arising from the audit. \n \n113.  Formal meetings of the Audit Committee are the heart of its work. However, the Audit \nCommittee Chairperson, and to a lesser extent, the other members, need to keep in touch on a \ncontinuing basis with the key people involved in the CGIF's governance, including the Board \nChairperson, the CEO, CRO, the CFO, the external audit lead partner and the Internal Auditor. \n \n114.  The Audit Committee has access to CGIF staff on all Audit Committee matters including: \nassisting the Chairperson in planning the Committee's work, drawing up meeting agendas, \nmaintaining minutes, drafting material about its activities for the Annual Report, collecting and \ndistributing information and providing necessary support. \n \n115.  The Board is responsible for providing sufficient resources to enable the Audit Committee \nto undertake its duties and to take independent legal, accounting or other advice when the \nCommittee reasonably believes it necessary to do so. \n \nC.  CGIF Internal Control and Risk Management Committee (ICRMC) \n116.  CGIF\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  will    have  an  Internal  Control  and  Risk  Management \nCommittee  tasked  with  ensuring  that  only  sound  guarantee  and  investment  proposals  are \nagreed by the Board of Directors and that there are  sound and effective systems of internal \ncontrol and  risk management operating to safeguard Contributors\u2019 investment and CGIF\u2019s ", "76        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \nassets.  CGIF\u2019s  Board  of  Directors  will    have  an  Internal  Control  and  Risk  Management \nCommittee  tasked  with  ensuring  that  only  sound  guarantee  and  investment  proposals  are \nagreed by the Board of Directors and that there are  sound and effective systems of internal \ncontrol and  risk management operating to safeguard Contributors\u2019 investment and CGIF\u2019s \nassets \n \n117.  The Chairperson of the ICRMC must be professionally qualified in finance and have \nsubstantial experience in managing financial and/or banking functions within ASEAN+3. The \nmembers of this Committee must be professionally qualified in financial analysis so as to enable \nthem to understand the analysis and make contributions to the evaluation of the guarantee and \ninvestment proposals. \n \n118.  This Committee oversees the risk management procedures in developing guarantee and \ninvestment proposals including the analytical and financial due diligence considerations used in \ntheir preparation. The Board and its Internal Control and Risk Management Committee will \nannually  review  and  maintain  the  adequacy  of  internal  controls  and  risk  management.  A \nmember of the External Advisory Panel may also attend Committee meetings. \n \n119.  The  ICRMC:  (a) in  conjunction  with  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee, \nrecommend a candidate for CRO to the Board; and (b) supervises the activities of the CRO. \n \n120.  In  ensuring  the  adequacy  of  systems  of  internal  control  and  risk  management,  the \nICRMC considers the following factors: (i) the nature and extent of risks faced by CGIF; (ii) \nthe extent and categories of risks which it regards as acceptable for CGIF to bear; (iii) the \nlikelihood of the risks materializing; (iv) the ability to reduce the incidence and impact on CGIF \nof the risks that do materialize; and (v) the costs of operating specific controls to mitigate risks. \n \n121.  The  system  of  internal  control  and  risk  management  encompasses  the  policies, \nprocesses, tasks and other aspects of CGIF\u2019s operations that: \n \n(i)  Facilitate CGIF\u2019s ability to anticipate, measure and respond appropriately \nto significant strategic, business, operational, financial compliance and \nother  risks  in  achieving  its  corporate  and  policy  objectives,  including \nsafeguards of assets from inappropriate use or from loss and fraud, and \nensuring that liabilities are identified and managed; \n \n(ii)  Help maintain a high quality of internal and external reporting through \nmaintenance  of  proper  records  and  processes  to  generate  a  flow  of \ntimely, relevant and reliable information; and \n \n(iii)  Ensure  compliance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  with \ninternal policies on business conduct and ethics. \n \n122.  The  annual  report  of  CGIF  includes  a  Statement  on  Internal  Controls  and  Risk \nManagement prepared by ICRMC for the Board of Directors. The Statement describes and \naffirms the effectiveness of the system, structure and processes of internal control and risk \nmanagement of the company. \n ", "Appendix 3  77 \n1.  Purpose of Internal Control \n \n123.   CGIF\u2019s system of internal control plays a key role in the management of risks that are \nsignificant  to  the  achievement  of  business  objectives.  An  effective  internal  control  system \ncontributes to safeguarding the Contributors\u2019 investment and CGIF\u2019s assets. Internal control \nfacilitates the effectiveness and efficiency of CGIF\u2019s operations, and helps ensure the reliability \nof internal and external reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. \n \n124.  Effective financial controls, including the maintenance of proper accounting records, are \nkey components of internal control. They help ensure that CGIF is not unnecessarily exposed to \navoidable financial risks and that financial information used within CGIF and for disclosures is \nreliable. They contribute to safeguarding assets, including the detection and prevention of fraud. \n \n125.  Because  CGIF\u2019s  objectives,  business  scope,  internal  organization  and  the  business \nenvironment within which it operates are continually evolving, the risks are continually changing. \nAn effective system of internal control therefore depends on a thorough and regular assessment \nof the nature and extent of risks which CGIF is exposed to. Since any business decision \ninvolves an element of risk, the purpose of internal control is to help manage and control risk \nrather than eliminate it. \n \n126.  In ensuring that an effective system of internal control is in place, CGIF\u2019s Board and the \nAudit Committee consider whether the system: \n \n(i)  Reflects sound business practice whereby internal control is embedded in \nthe business processes by which CGIF pursues its objectives; \n \n(ii)  Is  updated  and  remains  relevant  over  time  in  a  continually  evolving \nbusiness environment and as CGIF develops; and \n \n(iii)  Allows CGIF to apply internal controls in a manner which takes account of \nits particular circumstances. \n \n2.  Responsibilities of the Board \n \n127.   ICRMC  is  responsible  for  CGIF\u2019s  system  of  internal  control.  Based  upon \nrecommendations from ICRMC, the Board establishes appropriate policies on internal control \nand assures itself that the system is functioning effectively. ICRMC must ensure that the system \nof internal control is effective in managing risks in the manner that the Board has approved. \n \n128.  In determining the appropriate policies on internal control, and in evaluating the system\u2019s \neffectiveness and functioning, the Board considers the following factors: \n \n(i)  Nature and extent of the risks faced by CGIF; \n \n(ii)  Extent and categories of risk which the Board regards as acceptable for \nCGIF to bear; \n \n(iii)  Likelihood of the risks materializing; \n \n(iv)  CGIF\u2019s ability and capacity to reduce the incidence and impact on CGIF \nof risks that do materialize; and ", "78        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n \n(v)  Costs of operating particular controls relative to the potential benefits from \nmanaging the specific risks. \n \n129.  While it is ICRMC\u2019s responsibility to develop appropriate policies on internal control and \nto ensure that the system of internal control is functioning effectively in line with policies, it is the \nrole of management to implement the policies on risk and control. Management identifies and \nevaluates the risks faced by CGIF for consideration by the ICRMC and designs, operates and \nmonitors the system of internal control in line with Board policies. \n \n130.  All  employees  of  CGIF  have  a  collective  and  joint  responsibility  for  ensuring  the \neffectiveness of internal control, and in particular for their respective accountability in achieving \nobjectives they have been assigned. \n \n131.  An important part of ICRMC\u2019s responsibilities for internal control is regular review of the \neffectiveness of CGIF\u2019s system of internal control. The ICRMC forms its own judgment on \neffectiveness after due and careful review based on information and assurances provided by \nmanagement. As such, management will be accountable to ICRMC for monitoring and operating \nthe system of internal control, and for providing evidence and assurance to the ICRMC that it \nhas done so. \n \n3.  Components of an Effective System of Internal Control \n \n132.  The system of internal control covers the policies, processes, tasks and behaviors and \nother aspects of CGIF that, together, ensure: \n \n(i)  Effective  and  efficient  operation  by  enabling  CGIF  to  respond \nappropriately to significant business, operational, financial, compliance \nand  other  risks  to  achieving  CGIF\u2019s  objectives.  This  includes  the \nsafeguarding of assets from inappropriate and improper use, loss and \nfraud, and ensuring liabilities are identified and managed; \n \n(ii)  The  quality  of  internal  and  external  reporting.  This  requires  the \nmaintenance of proper records and processes that generate a flow of \ntimely, relevant and reliable information; and \n \n(iii)  Compliance  with  all  applicable  laws  and  regulations,  and  also  with \ninternal policies on conduct of CGIF\u2019s business. \n \n133.  CGIF\u2019s  system  of  internal  control  will  reflect  its  control  environment,  including  its \norganizational structure. The system includes: \n \n(i)  Control activities; \n \n(ii)  Information and communications processes; and \n \n(iii)  Processes  for  monitoring  the  effectiveness  of  the  system  of  internal \ncontrol. \n \n134.  The system of internal control is built into, and forms an integral part and culture of, the \noperations of CGIF. The system is designed and operated to enable it to respond quickly to ", "Appendix 3  79 \nevolving risks arising from changes both within CGIF and from its business environment. It \nincludes  procedures  for  reporting  immediately  to  appropriate  levels  of  management  any \nsignificant control failures that are identified, and for rapid corrective action. \n \n4.  Reviewing the Effectiveness of Internal Control \n \n135.   The ICRMC regularly receives and reviews reports on internal control. It also undertakes \nan annual assessment. With the endorsement of the Board of Directors, the results of the \nannual assessment are disclosed as a public statement on internal control in the annual CGIF \nreport to ensure that all significant aspects of internal control for CGIF for the year under review \nhave been considered. \n \n136.  The ICRMC defines the process to be adopted for its review of the effectiveness of \ninternal control. This covers both the scope and frequency of the reports it receives and reviews \nduring the year and also the process for its annual assessment. In its review process, the \nICRMC is provided with sound, appropriately documented, support for its statement on internal \ncontrol in CGIF\u2019s annual report. \n \n137.  There will be openness and regular communications between management and the \nBoard on matters relating to risk and internal control, notably with respect to the financial due \ndiligence undertaken in extending guarantees on corporate bonds. The management will submit \nreports on its implementation and operation of internal controls to the Board. These reports will \nprovide a balanced assessment of the significant risks and the effectiveness of the system of \ninternal control in managing these risks. Any significant failings or weaknesses in control will be \nidentified and discussed in the reports, including the impact that they have had, could have had, \nor may have, on CGIF and the actions being taken to address them. \n \n138.  In reviewing reports from management, the ICRMC: \n \n(i)   Identifies the major risks and assess how they have been, evaluated and \nmanaged; \n \n(ii)  Assesses the effectiveness of the related system of internal control in \nmanaging the significant risks, taking special account of any significant \nfailings or weaknesses in internal control that have been reported; \n \n(iii)  Considers  whether  the  necessary  remedial  actions  are  being  taken \npromptly to address any significant failings or weaknesses; and \n \n(iv)  Considers  whether  the  findings  reveal  a  need  for  more  extensive \nmonitoring of the system of internal controls. \n \n139.  In its annual assessment of internal control, and in its public statement on internal control \nin the annual report, the ICRMC pays special attention to: \n \n(i)  Changes, since the last annual assessment, in the nature and extent of \nsignificant risks faced by CGIF, and CGIF\u2019s ability to respond to changes \nin the business and external environment; \n ", "80        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n(ii)  The scope and quality of management\u2019s on-going monitoring of risks and \nof the system of internal control, and where applicable, the work of its \ninternal audit function and other providers or mechanisms of assurance; \n \n(iii)  The extent and frequency of the communication of the results of the \nmanagement\u2019s monitoring to the Board which would allow the Board to \ndevelop a cumulative assessment of the state of internal control in CGIF \nand the effectiveness with which risks are being managed; \n \n(iv)  The incidence of significant control failings or weaknesses that have been \nidentified at any time during the period under review, and the extent to \nwhich they have resulted in unforeseen outcomes or contingencies that \nhave had, could have had, or may in the future have, a material impact on \nCGIF\u2019s financial performance or condition; and \n \n(v)  The effectiveness of CGIF\u2019s public reporting or disclosure process. \n \n140.  The issues and questions which the ICRMC considers and discusses with management \nwhen  reviewing  management\u2019s  reports  on  internal  control,  and  in  the  Board\u2019s  annual \nassessment, could include the following. \n \na.  Risk Management \n141.  Does CGIF have clear objectives and have they been communicated so as to provide \neffective direction to employees on risk management and control issues? Do objectives and \nrelated plans include measurable performance targets, indicators or benchmarks? \n \n142.  Are the significant internal and external operational, financial, compliance and other risks \nidentified  and  assessed  on  an  on-going  basis?  Have  CGIF\u2019s  key  risks  been appropriately \nidentified? Have the likely incidence and potential impact of these risks been appropriately \nmeasured?  Have  appropriate  policies  and  systems  been  developed  and  implemented  to \nmanage these risks? \n \n143.  Has ICRMC communicated to management, and other relevant persons within CGIF, \nwhat risks the Board has deemed to be acceptable? \n \nb.  Control Environment and Control Activities \n144.  Does ICRMC have clear strategies for dealing with significant risks that have been \nidentified? Is there a clear policy for managing these risks, for example through guarantee \ncovenants? \n \n145.  Do CGIF\u2019s corporate culture, business practices, human resource policies and incentive \n(performance  reward)  systems  support  CGIF\u2019s  business  objectives,  risk  management  and \ninternal control system? \n \n146.  Are authority, lines of responsibility and accountability clearly defined such that decisions \nare made and actions taken by the appropriate persons within CGIF? Are the decisions and \nactions of different parties within CGIF sufficiently transparent and coordinated? \n ", "Appendix 3  81 \n147.  Does the ICRMC and Executive Committee communicate to staff what is expected of \nthem and the scope of their freedom to act? This applies in particular to areas such as: human \nresource policies, customer relations, outsourcing, procurement, health and safety, security of \ntangible and intangible assets, expenditures, accounting and financial reporting. \n \nA.  CGIF Nomination and Remuneration Committee \n148.  The performance of a company is strongly determined by the quality of its employees,  \nCGIF, therefore, needs to be able to attract and retain the best qualified professionals. It also \nneeds to ensure that incentive systems motivate and elicit best effort from management and \nalso align their interests with those of Contributors to ensure that they operate in the best \ninterests of Contributors and other stakeholders. \n \n149.  The role of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee is to provide CGIF\u2019s Board of \nDirectors with a formal, transparent and effective mechanism for the selection and remuneration \nof the best qualified senior executives in a competitive manner.  \n \n150.  In most companies, a separate Remuneration Committee is established alongside the \nNomination Committee and tasked with the determination of incentive policies and schemes for \nsenior executives. However, given the likely staff size, CGIF will have a joint Nomination and \nRemuneration Committee. \n \n151.  The Nomination and Remuneration Committee will have three Board members including \nthe Chairperson of the Board of Directors and the ADB Board member. \n \n152.  The Nomination and Remuneration Committee reports to the Board of Directors and has \nno executive powers, although it has the full power of the Board in terms of approving specific  \nremuneration packages for senior executives. A member of the External Advisory Panel may \nalso attend Committee meetings. \n \n153.  Its main responsibility is to identify and select, through due process and in a transparent \nand competitive manner, the best qualified candidates for senior executive positions namely the \nCEO, the CRO (in cooperation with the Internal Control and Risk Management Committee), and \nthe  Internal  Auditor  (in  cooperation  with  the  Audit  committee)  and  to  determine  their \nremuneration  and  related  terms  and  conditions  in  line  with  internationally  competitive \nbenchmarks for comparable positions.  The Nomination and Remuneration Committee submits \nits report and recommendations to the Board for review and approval. \n \n1.   Nominations \n \n154.   The Nomination and Remuneration Committee is empowered, and given the resources, \nto seek the services of an internationally qualified professional recruitment agency or consultant, \nin identifying potential candidates. This provides the Committee with access to a wide choice of \npossible qualified candidates and provides assurance to the Board and Contributors that a \nthorough, competitive and professional process has been used in the selection process. If CGIF \ndecides to use consultants, then the Committee will choose the consultants. \n \n155.  The Nomination and Remuneration Committee is also empowered to consult, and where \nappropriate, co-opt representatives of the Trustee and Contributors as non-voting members of \nthe Committee to assist it in its selection process. \n ", "82        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n156.  Potential candidates are provided with sufficient information about CGIF and the rights \nand  responsibilities  of  Board  members  to  enable  them  to  gain  an  understanding  of  their \nexpected  role.  Selected  candidates  have  the  opportunity  to  meet  with  all  existing  Board \nmembers.  Members  of  the  Board,  after  having  met  with  a  candidate,  may  express  any \nreservations in confidence to the chairperson of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee. \nThe final decision to make an offer takes place after a discussion by the Board of Directors upon \nthe Nomination and Remuneration Committee\u2019s recommendations. \n \n157.  Other duties of the Committee include the following: \n \n(i)  Have plans in place for the succession of the Chairperson and the CEO; \n \n(ii)  Make the necessary recommendations to the Board for the continuation \nin  service  of  executive  staff  of  CGIF  in  so  far  as  the  selection  and \nappointment  of  these  management  executives  are  responsibilities \nassigned to the Nomination and Remuneration Committee; \n \n(iii)  Provide  the  necessary  information  to  the  Board  relating  to  matters \nconcerning the selection of management executives, to be included in \nCGIF\u2019s annual report; and \n \n(iv)  Ensure  that  the  Chairperson  of  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration \nCommittee attends the Meeting of Contributors fully prepared to respond \nto any questions from Contributors relating to the nomination and election \nof the CEO. \n \n2.  Remuneration \n \na.       Remuneration Policy \n \n158.  In complying with the best practice in corporate governance, the remuneration policy will \nfollow the following principles: \n \n(i)  The  pay  for  executive  staff  will  not  be  set  by  executive  staff  but  be \ndetermined by a Remuneration Committee of the Board; \n \n(ii)  The remuneration (including pension rights) of management executives \n(such as the CEO), will be fully disclosed to Contributors in the CGIF \nannual report and thereby subject to scrutiny and review by Contributors \nat the Meeting of Contributors; and \n \n(iii)  The component parts of remuneration are so configured to link rewards to \ncorporate and individual performance with bonus payments put into a \npool,  initially  10%  of  profits  each  year,  but  held  in  trust  for  those \nemployees awarded with bonuses until those bond guarantees that were \nissued in any given year have matured without calls or where the profit \npool  has  been  reduced  by  any  such  calls.  The  CRO  and  the  risk \nmanagement staff will not be eligible for bonuses and this differential will \nbe taken into account in setting their base salaries. \n ", "Appendix 3  83 \n159.  In the case of CGIF, a potential issue is more likely to be the setting of sufficiently \nattractive remuneration for management executives to enable CGIF to recruit the best qualified \nprofessionals, rather than in controlling excessive pay. To ensure the open and competitive \nrecruitment of the best qualified professionals, CGIF adopts market-based remuneration for \nexecutives and staff to attract qualified professionals from the private sector. \n \n160.  International experience suggests that the more effective and equitable incentives plans \nare those based on longer-term performance. The incentive scheme, therefore, includes the \nfollowing objectives: \n \n(i)  To  create  a  closer  alignment  between  management  and  shareholder \ninterests. \n \n(ii)  To encourage a longer-term view among the management team. The \nbalance of the incentive may be changed from an emphasis on annual to \nan emphasis on longer-term performance. \n \n(iii)  The  equating  of  the  timing  of  the  incentive  to  the  incidence  of \nmanagement  decisions.  As  management  actions  and  investment \ndecisions affect CGIF\u2019s performance over a forward period of at least five \nyears,  the  incentive  arrangements  will  necessarily  have  to  track  this \nperformance period. \n \n(iv)  To measure tangible management success and to ensure management \npersonnel  retention  and  recruitment.  By  linking  the  incentive  to \nperformance  of  a  group  of  comparable  companies,  the  measure  of \nachievement of management against its peers can be recognized. \n \nb.     Role and Responsibilities Relating to Remuneration \n161.  The  Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee  is  tasked  with  determining  and \nrecommending to the Board of Directors and the Meeting of Contributors the remuneration for \nmanagement. It is authorized by the Board to exercise all the powers of the Board under CGIF\u2019s \nAoA in respect of payment of remuneration, pensions and any other compensation to senior \nexecutives  of  CGIF  in  accordance  with  the  Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee\u2019s \nmandate and Terms of Reference. \n \n162.  The Committee makes recommendations to the Board and the Meeting of Contributors, \nwithin the agreed terms of reference for the Committee, on CGIF\u2019s policy, framework and \nstructure of executive remuneration and its cost, and to determine on the Board\u2019s behalf specific \nremuneration packages (including pension rights and any compensation payments) for the CEO \nand other management executives. \n \n163.  The Committee is responsible for: \n \n(i)  Making recommendations to the Board on CGIF\u2019s policy, framework and \nstructure of senior executives\u2019 remuneration and its cost, and making \nrecommendations on specific remuneration packages (including pension \nrights, bonuses and any other rewards) for the CEO and other senior \nexecutives; \n ", "84        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n(ii)  Approving, on behalf of the Board, any contract of service or employment \nfor senior executives; \n \n(iii)  Determining  the  remuneration  and  rewards  for  senior  executives  in \naccordance with the authority delegated from the Board; \n \n(iv)  Determining  the  terms  of  any  compensation  package,  to  be \nrecommended for senior executives, in the event of any early termination \nof their contract of service; \n \n(v)  Reviewing  remuneration  and  employment  policies  and  conditions \nelsewhere so as to develop and maintain CGIF\u2019s competitiveness in its \nremuneration and employment policies with regard to senior executives, \nand generally ensuring that senior remuneration administration operates \non a \u201cbest practice basis\u201d. \n \n164.  It  is  important  that  the  Committee  be  provided  with  all  information  it  requires.  The \nCommittee is empowered, and have the appropriate resources, to seek the advice of outside \nexperts in addressing issues relating to appropriate incentives, reward and retention of senior \nexecutives. \n \n165.  The Committee prepares a Remuneration Report to the Meeting of Contributors for \ninclusion in CGIF\u2019s annual report. The Report contains the following: \n \n(i)  A  statement  that  full  consideration  has  been  given  to  best  practice \nprovisions  relating  to  remuneration  policy,  service  contracts  and \ncompensation; \n \n(ii)  A summary of the Committee\u2019s terms of reference; \n \n(iii)  Names  of  members  of  the  Committee,  including  their  record  of \nattendance of Committee meetings; \n \n(iv)  A table of emoluments or remuneration, including pensions and any other \nrewards  and  expenses  for  each  Board  member,  and  of  selected \nmanagement executives (such as the CEO, CFO and Vice President of \nOperations) for the financial year; and \n \n(v)  Where appropriate, an explanation of the formulae or methodology for the \ndetermination  of  performance-related  incentives  for  management  \nexecutives. \n \nD.  Terms of Reference for the External Advisory Panel \n166.  CGIF  is  involved  in  activities  that  are  inherently  risky.  In  such  circumstances  it  is \nimportant that the Board of Directors has access to advice that is objective and based on a \nsound understanding of corporate finance, international financial administration, bond issuance, \nbond guarantees and bond markets. The role of the External Advisory Panel is therefore to \nprovide  specialized  technical  inputs  to  enable  the  Board  of  Directors  to  understand  the \ncomplexities and risks associated with particular decisions. The External Advisory Panel is an \nimportant resource for the Board of Directors. ", "Appendix 3  85 \n \n167.  The External Advisory Panel is expected to render an independent and unbiased opinion \non all non-routine matters considered by the Board of Directors and its Committees (routine \nmatters  are,  by  contrast,  decisions  concerning  office  facilities,  secretarial  support  and \nmeeting/agenda issues). These opinions are detailed and in writing. If the Board of Directors or \nits Committees make a decision that is at variance with the course proposed by the External \nAdvisory Panel they are required to provide a written justification for their decision. A record of \nthese advisory opinions relative to the actual decisions of the Board and its Committees is \nincluded in the CGIF Annual Report that is provided to the Meeting of Contributors.  \n \n168.  Members of the External Advisory Panel are entitled to attend all meetings of the Board \nof Directors and its Committees, Management Committee Meetings and Meeting of Contributors \nas observers. The Chairperson of the Board of Directors and the CEO are required to inform the \nExternal Advisory Panel members of all such meetings and to provide them with a copy of the \ndocumentation for the meeting participants. For meetings where the External Advisory Panel is \nrequired  to  provide  advisory  views  on  the  topics  for  decision,  copies  of  the  meeting \ndocumentation must be provided to the External Advisory Panel well in advance so that the \nPanel has the opportunity to do the necessary analysis and follow-up consultations that may be \nrequired with CGIF staff and outside experts. The resulting opinion from the External Advisory \nPanel  is  included  in  the  meeting  documents  for  participants\u2019  consideration.  The  External \nAdvisory Panel must also be copied on all management and Board reports and on background \nanalysis or information prepared for management or the Board. \n \n169.  The External Advisory Panel of the Board of Directors provides specialist guidance to \nCommittees  of  the  Board  and  to  the  Board  as  a  whole.  Minutes  and  decisions  of  those \nCommittees and of the Board as a whole includes the guidance and recommendations provided \nby the External Advisory Panel and in cases where the recommendations of the External \nAdvisory Panel are not adopted, the Committee or the Board as a whole gives the reasons why \nthe recommendations have not been adopted. \n \n170.  The External Advisory Panel assignments are not full time positions, but at certain times \nfull time attention to agenda items will be required in order not to delay CGIF decision making. \nExternal Advisory Panel members are therefore required to compile a log of the time spent on \nCGIF activities so that appropriate compensation can be made. The Chairperson of the External \nAdvisory Panel is expected to certify these records from the other External Advisory Panel \nmembers and the Chairperson of the Board of Directors is required to: \n \n(i)  certify the inputs record from the Chairperson of the External Advisory \nPanel; \n \n(ii)  authorize  CGIF  consulting  payments  for  all  services  provided  by  the \nExternal Advisory Panel; and \n \n(iii)  authorize payments for outside experts that the Advisory Panel may need \nto consult to ensure international best practices in all CGIF operations. \n \n171.  The External Advisory Panel members are highly qualified consultants appointed by the \nMeeting of Contributors as proposed by the Trustee and reporting to the Chairperson of the \nBoard  of  Directors  and  to  the  Meeting  of  Contributors.  They  must  have  the  following \nqualifications and experience: \n ", "86        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n(i)  The Chairperson of the External Advisory Panel will be a broad based \nexpert with experience in corporate, banking and financial issues in Asia \nand  internationally.  He  or  she  must  be  capable  of  managing  and \nassessing  the  necessary  financial  due  diligence  and  assessing  the \ncreditworthiness  of  guarantee  operations  in  the  ASEAN+3  region. \nExperience in a multilateral development institution as well as financial \nand economic training at the Masters\u2019 level (preferably at the doctoral \nlevel) is required. \n(ii)  One of the External Advisory Panel members will be a high level financial \nanalyst  with  considerable  experience  in  financial  due  diligence  and \nstructuring of security and covenants to protect CGIF interests with the \nextension of a bond guarantee. He or she must have educational training \nto the Masters\u2019 level in finance, and preferably financial qualifications \nsuch as CPA or a CFA and at least 10 years experience in financial due \ndiligence and financial engineering focused on the ASEAN+3 region. \n(iii)  The third External Advisory Panel member will be a budgetary expert with \nat least 10 years experience in business planning, and budgeting with a \ngood understanding of international best practices in accounting, auditing \nand  financial  reporting.  He  or  she  must  have  a  Masters\u2019  degree  in \naccounting or finance. This External Advisory Panel member will also \nhave  professional  qualifications  such  as  a  CPA  with  substantial \nexperience  with  one  of  the  big  four  auditing  companies  or  with \nmultinationals in the ASEAN+3 region. \n \n172.  The External Advisory Panel members require appropriate offices at CGIF headquarters \nto allow expeditious completion of their advisory work during busy times of the year. Personal \nassistants will also be required to ensure full efficiency of the External Advisory Panel members. ", "Appendix 3  87 \nIII.  Managerial  Decision-Making in CGIF \nA.  Chief Executive Officer \n173.  The CEO is responsible for day-to-day operations of CGIF.  The CEO is appointed by \nthe Trustee after the Meeting of Contributors has approved the recommended candidate of the \nBoard of Directors. Under the strategic guidance of the Board, the CEO has full authority to \noperate  and  manage  CGIF  under  the  mandates,  financial  targets,  parameters  of  risk \nmanagement, annual budgets and business plans as approved by the Board of Directors. (see \nAppendix 1 for the  organizational structure of CGIF). \n \nB.  Management Committees \n \n174.  There are two management committees that assist in managing CGIF: \n \ni.  the Executive Committee which is chaired by the CEO, meets weekly to \ndecide on all non-routine operational matters. The size and composition of \nthe  Executive  Committee  is  determined  by  the  Board  of  Directors,  its \nmembers  appointed  by  the  Trustee  upon  the  Board\u2019s  recommendation \n(after  taking  account  of  suggestions  from  the  Board\u2019s  Nomination  and \nRemuneration Committee).  \n \nii.  the Guarantee and Investment Committee, which is chaired by the CRO, is \nresponsible  for  assessing  and  managing  risk  associated  with  CGIF \noperations. The size and composition of the Guarantee and Investment \nCommittee is determined by the Board of Directors, its members appointed \nby the Trustee upon the Board\u2019s recommendation (after taking account of \nthe suggestions from of the Board\u2019s Internal Control and Risk Management \nCommittee).  \n \n175.  The decisions of the Executive Committee and Guarantee and Investement Committee \nare on a consensus basis. \n \n176.  To ensure that risk management and control are operationally independent of business \nmanagement, the CRO reports directly to the Chairperson of the Board\u2019s Internal Control and \nRisk Management Committee on proposed bond guarantees and associated investment risks, \nand to the CEO on day-to-day operations and administrative matters. \n \n177.  Prior to the approval of the first guarantee, the Board of Directors must have considered \nand approved a detailed Business Plan and internal rating system for CGIF. Once a guarantee \nhas  been  identified  for  an  ASEAN+3  corporation  and  endorsed  by  the  CEO  for  further \nconsideration, the Guarantee and Investment Committee screens guarantees (and investments) \nto control overall risk. It approves guarantee and investment proposals for consideration of the \nBoard of Directors. In the initial phase of CGIF operations, all guarantee proposals must be \napproved by the Board of Directors \n \n178.  CGIF management executives including the Vice President of Operations, CFO, and \nGeneral  Counsel  may  serve  on  both  the  Executive  Committee  and  the  Guarantee  and \nInvestment  Committee.  Other  functional  or  specialized  committees  may  be  created  at  the ", "88        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \nexecutive level when appropriate and as determined by the Board of Directors in conjunction \nwith the CEO. \n \n \nC.  External and Internal Auditors   \n \n179.   CGIF\u2019s External Auditor is appointed by the Meeting of Contributors and must be an \ninternationally recognized firm of good repute upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee \nof the Board of Directors. Both the Internal and External Auditors report to the Chairperson of \nthe Board\u2019s Audit Committee. The External Auditor liaises with the Internal Auditor and Chief \nAccountant to ensure that accounting systems employed effectively meet all international audit \nand reporting standards. \n \nD.  Reporting Relationships \n \n180.  All CGIF executives except the CRO and Internal Auditor report directly to and are \nfunctionally  responsible to the CEO. All CGIF executives are administratively responsible to the \nCEO.  \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 3  89 \nIV.  Financial Policies \nA.  Fund Contributions \n \n181.  The operation of CGIF is financed solely from funds contributed by member countries \nand ADB. Any surplus for a preceding fiscal year is allocated to CGIF\u2019s reserves, provided that if \ndetermined by the Meeting of Contributors, an appropriate amount of surplus is distributed to \nshareholders. No Contributor has the right to receive any distributions from CGIF except as \nprovided in the AoA. \n \nB.  No Borrowing \n \n182.  CGIF will not borrow from any source to finance its operations except for the purposes of \ncash management. For example it may well be advantageous to use short term borrowing as \nopposed to liquidating an investment position to meet the cash need for a call on a guarantee or \nany other CGIF operational requirements. The consideration for borrowing for purposes of cash \nmanagement is not intended to create a net liability position but simply to supply the needed \nliquidity. \n \nC.  Limits on Contingent Liabilities and Leverage \n183.  The aggregate amount of contingent liabilities that may be assumed by CGIF at any time \nby the issuance of guarantees outstanding shall not exceed the total paid in capital of CGIF plus \nretained earnings less reserves, less all illiquid investments. \n \n184.  The aggregate amount of contingent liabilities that may be assumed by CGIF at any time \nby the issuance of guarantees outstanding shall not exceed the total paid in capital of CGIF plus \nretained  earnings,  less  provisions  for  credit  and  foreign  exchange  losses  and  all  illiquid \ninvestments. The Meeting of Contributors, with a recommendation from the Board of Directors, \nmay approve leverage above 1:1, as appropriate, provided that the excess over the total paid in \ncapital of CGIF plus retained earnings, less provisions and all illiquid investments made by \nCGIF, are reinsured. A detailed counterparty risk policy, including a minimum rating for re-\ninsurers, will be included in the CGIF risk management framework. \n \nD.   Guarantee Fees \n \n185.  CGIF guarantee fee is market based and reflects the risk of the underlying credit CGIF is \nguaranteeing. The benefit of the CGIF guarantee is measured in terms of the reduced interest \nrate  cost  associated  with  the  upgraded  bond  issue.  The  benefit  is  assessed  with  the  full \ninvolvement of the issuer and the guarantee fee for CGIF is negotiated with the issuer, at least \ncommensurating to the underlying credit risk of the bonds to be guaranteed by CGIF and \nmeeting CGIF's criteria of a minimum return on capital. \n \nE.  Limitation of Liability \n \n186.  No contributor is liable, by reason of its participation in CGIF, for any obligations of \nCGIF, including any obligations to pay under the guarantees. Under the AoA, the liability of each \nContributor is limited to the unpaid portion of the Shares it has subscribed that has become due \nand payable. ", "90        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n \nF.  Foreign exchange policy \n \n187.  As CGIF is not authorized to borrow for its operations, other than for fully covered money \nmarket operations, no foreign exchange exposures are envisaged to arise from debt operations.  \n \n188.  CGIF guarantee operations involve the issuance of guarantees for local currency bonds \ndenominated most  commonly in one of the currencies of the ASEAN+3 countries (U.S. dollars \nmight also be used by some of these countries for bond guarantees but that would present no \ncontingent  foreign  exchange  risks  for  CGIF  as  its  functional  currency  is  the  U.S.  dollar). \nNevertheless, CGIF will be exposed to considerable currency risk due as it will guarantee bonds \ndenominated in a wide range of Asian currencies. To ensure that CGIF leverage ratio is within \n1:1, a marked to market value adjustment of its guarantees will be undertaken weekly. \n \n189.   The contingent foreign exchange risks can be significant over the period that the local \ncurrency bonds are expected to be outstanding.9 In the absence of market instruments to hedge \ncontingent foreign exchange risks, CGIF's initial contingent foreign exchange risk provisioning \nwill be prudently determined based on the 99% Value at Risk point of local currency movement  \nfor individual bond guaranteed by CGIF based on the historical volatilities of foreign exchange \noptions with tenors of at least 1 year. Since the volatilities can increase significantly in times of \nmarket stress, either a buffer will be applied to these results or the highest volatilities from the \nentire period will be used. The foreign exchange provisioning will take into account the maturity \nof  the  individual  bonds  guaranteed  by  CGIF.    The  determination  of  the  foreign  exchange \nprovisioning will be made annually, however, in case of a higher than expected depreciation of \nthe US dollar, additional provisions will be considered to ensure that CGIF could maintain its 1:1 \nleverage ratio.  This foreign exchange provision is separate from the credit loss provisioning.  \n \n190.  The guarantee fees will be upfront and charged in U.S. dollars or in local currency. The \nfees charged in local currency will be immediately converted into U.S. dollars. Local currency \ncontingent risks are also constrained by the country limit of 20% for bond guarantees issued. \nU.S. dollars will likely be the non-local currency of choice and that currency will not involve \ncurrency risks for CGIF since the CGIF functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Other currencies \nare not likely to present meaningful risks for CGIF as prior to CGIF accepting non-local currency \nas the denomination for the bond and the guarantee, the corporation  will have to satisfy CGIF \nthat it had a natural hedge in that currency, i.e. was earning revenues in that currency to repay \nthe bond obligation. \n \n \n                                                 \n9 Using the survey demand for the expected currency denomination of the local currency bonds (Demand Study for \nCGIF,  January  2009),  the  distribution  of  guarantees  in  ASEAN+3  currencies  would  have  meant  that  those \ncontingent foreign exchange risks over the historical five-year periods from 1975 to 2005 would have resulted in \ngains/losses between -0.29% and +0.264% during these five-year periods, assuming that 1.0% of the guarantees \nare called. This is much higher than the 0.27% deferred rates expressed on BBB rated bonds as calculated by \nMoody's from 1920-2009. While such contingent foreign exchange risks can theoretically be covered by long dated \noptions, such options are not generally available in Asia due to a combination of factors associated with exchange \ncontrols, the lack of suitable counterparties, inadequate maturities on the available swap rates and the very high \ncosts in the isolated situations where OTC solutions could be made available. As a result, commonly accepted \nmarket practices in Asia do not include the use of options to cover contingent foreign exchange risks and, as a \nresult, the reserves for contingent foreign exchange losses will be set in line with the volatility of the currency of \ndenomination of the guarantee extended. ", "Appendix 3  91 \nV.  Prudential Limits \n191.  The  prudential  limits  for  CGIF  are  modeled  on  ADB\u2019s  prudential  limits  for  its  non-\nsovereign portfolio, that is, its loans, equity investments and guarantees are not subject to \ncounter-guarantees from Government. Prudential limits include the (i) country exposure limit, (ii) \nindustry exposure limit, (iii) group exposure limit, and (iv) single exposure limit. These proposed \nprudential limits are intended to ensure that CGIF\u2019s portfolio of guarantees is well diversified and \nless prone to large unexpected losses than would be the case if it were concentrated in a few \ncountries or industries or confined to a few large borrowers or groups. \n \n192.  The development of the CGIF portfolio will be undertaken on a gradual basis from \nsmaller  sized  bond  guarantees  up  to  larger  sized  guarantees  to  ensure  that  even  in  the \nbeginning phases of CGIF, the portfolio of risks will be as diversified as possible. This same \napproach will be applied to the length of bond maturities that CGIF guarantees will a gradual \nlengthening of bond maturities to 3 to 5 years, again to ensure reduced risk and increased \ndiversification. This gradual approach is particularly important in the initial stages of CGIF\u2019s \nportfolio development because as is noted below, certain prudential limits such as industry, \nsingle and group exposures cannot be applied within country limits in early CGIF operations, \n \nA.  Country Exposure Limits \n193.  Country exposure limits are set by multilateral development banks (MDBs) to balance \ntwo considerations: (i) equitable access by clients and (ii) concentration of risks in the portfolio. \nIn line with the tradeoffs as assessed by ADB, the country limit for CGIF is 20% of its capital. \nThis will ensure access by smaller countries and that the portfolio is appropriately diversified.10 \nIn the case of an ASEAN+3 corporation requesting a CGIF guarantee for issuance in another \nASEAN+3 country, the country quota used is assigned to the nationality of the corporate issuer, \neven if locally incorporated in the issuing country. In light of this arrangement, the currency limit \nfor CGIF is set at 40% of its paid in capital.  \n \nB.  Industry Exposure Limits \n194.  Industry limits are intended to reduce CGIF\u2019s exposure to factors common to industries \nsuch as demand fluctuations, input costs for needed commodities, regulatory changes and \nfinancial contagion. \n \n195.  CGIF guarantees are not counter-guaranteed by the concerned Governments of the \nASEAN+3 countries. Without Government counter-guarantees, the entire credit risk and country \nrisks are borne by CGIF. The principal risk for CGIF's guarantees can be expected to be \nassociated with the industrial and individual corporate credit risks. \n \n196.  The sector classifications that are used by CGIF to monitor industrial concentration are \nas follows: \n \n(i)  Agriculture and primary products \n \n(ii)  Aerospace/automobile/capital goods/metal \n \n                                                 \n10 The actual levels of country limits in MGBs have tended to reflect equitable access criteria as the EBRD has set its \nlimit at 90% as reflecting the demands of its largest non-sovereign borrower (Russian Federation) while the AfDB \nratio of 20% reflects the demands from South Africa.  ", "92        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n(iii)  Consumer/service sector \n \n(iv)  Energy and natural resources \n \n(v)  Financial Institutions \n \n(vi)  Forest and building products/homebuilders \n \n(vii)  Healthcare/chemicals \n \n(viii)  High tech \n \n(ix)  Insurance \n \n(x)  Leisure time/media \n \n(xi)  Real estate \n \n(xii)  Telecommunications \n \n(xiii)  Transportation \n \n(xiv)  Utility \n \n197.  The  following  activities  are  included  in  CGIF\u2019s  list  of  prohibited  investments11  and \ntherefore do not qualify for CGIF guarantee: \n \n(i)  production or activities involving harmful or exploitative forms of forced \nlabor12 or child labor;13   \n \n(ii)  production of or trade in any product or activity deemed illegal under host \ncountry laws or regulations or international conventions and agreements \nor  subject  to  international  phase-outs  or  bans,  such  as  (a) \npharmaceuticals,14  pesticides,  and  herbicides,15  (b)  ozone-depleting \nsubstances,16  (c)  polychlorinated  biphenyls17  and  other  hazardous \nchemicals,18  (d)  wildlife  or  wildlife  products  regulated  under  the \n                                                 \n11 Based on ADB Prohibited Investment Activities.  \n12 Forced labor means all work or services not voluntarily performed, that is, extracted from individuals under threat of \nforce or penalty. \n13 Child labor means the employment of children whose age is below the host country\u2019s statutory minimum age of \nemployment or employment of children in contravention of International Labor Organization Convention No. 138 \n\u201cMinimum Age Convention\u201d (www.ilo.org).  \n14 A list of pharmaceutical products subject to phaseouts or bans is available at http://www.who.int.  \n15 A list of pesticides and herbicides subject to phaseouts or bans is available at http://www.pic.int. \n16 A list of the chemical compounds that react with and deplete stratospheric ozone resulting in the widely publicized \nozone holes is listed in the Montreal Protocol, together with target reduction and phaseout dates.

Each guarantee extended by CGIF is classified according to its industrial sector in \nparagraph  196  above  with  the  sector  distribution  being  monitored  so  that  there  is  no \nconcentration of sector risks in CGIF portfolio. A sector limitation of 30% is applicable in respect \nto each country limit. However, the sector limit will be waived until such time that CGIF\u2019s capital \nis increased or the maximum leverage ratio is raised by the Meeting of Contributors.   \nC.  Single and Group Exposure Limits  \n199.  Single exposure limits are intended to ensure that CGIF\u2019s portfolio of guarantees is not \nconcentrated on a few large recipients and that CGIF\u2019s portfolio risks are more diversified. To \nthe extent that client\u2019s risks are uncorrelated, overall portfolio risk is thereby reduced. The norm \nfor single exposure limit is 12% of the country limit. The group exposure limit is proposed to be \n30% the country limit. (Both single issuer and group exposure limit will be waived until such time \nthat CGIF\u2019s capital is increased or the maximum leverage ratio is raised by the Meeting of \nContributors).  \n \n                                                 \n19 A list is available at http://www.cites.org.  \n20 As defined by the Basel Convention; see http://www.basel.int. \n21 This does not apply to project sponsors who are not substantially involved in these activities. Not substantially \ninvolved means that the activity concerned is ancillary to a project sponsor's primary operations. \n22 This does not apply to the purchase and use of bonded asbestos cement sheeting where the asbestos content is \nless than 20%. \n23 This does not apply to the purchase of medical equipment, quality control (measurement) equipment, and any \nequipment for which ADB considers the radioactive source to be trivial and adequately shielded. \n \n ", "94        Appendix 3  Appendix 3 \n \n200.  The  proposed  single  and  group  exposure  limits  need  to  be  graduated  with  the \nintroduction of a risk rating system.  With such a system, it would be possible to base the \nrevised limits on the risk-adjusted size of the proposed guarantees. This will result in the single \ncustomer investment limit being smaller, the higher the risk of loss. The CRO develops such a \nrisk rating system and introduces it following Board approval within the first year of CGIF\u2019s \noperations. \n \n201.  In this assessment of customer risk, it is important to assess the client\u2019s ability and \nwillingness to  offer  appropriate  levels  of  security  for  the  proposed CGIF  guarantee.  Other \nexpected covenants relate to limitations on additional borrowing and the demonstration that the \nbond  proceeds  resulting  from  CGIF  guarantee  must  be  used  in  financing  the  intended \ninvestments with the expected results in terms of capacity augmentation, for example, being \nrealized. Guarantees fully backed by liens on corporate assets justify even lower risks. In \nperforming risk analysis, all indicators of financial deterioration will be taken into account, not \njust historical records of the concerned industry itself. Risk analysis will not be confined to \nhistorical data, no matter the length of that data series. \n \nD.  General Guarantee Loss Provisioning \n \n202.  General  guarantee  loss  provisions  refer  to  \"ex-ante\"  provisions  related  to  future \nuncertain  events. For  purposes  of  determining  an  appropriate  level  of  general  provisions, \nguarantees are equivalent to loans. As general guarantee loss provisioning varies over the \nbusiness cycle with higher guarantee loss provisions during the expansionary phase of the cycle \nand lower guarantee loss provision during the contractionary phase. Because the CGIF portfolio \nwill be necessarily concentrated, general guarantee loss provisioning will be set in line with the \ninternally generated bond ratings mapped to international ratings so that the probability of \ndefault on each bond and the entire portfolio can be fully assessed and adequately provisioned.  \nDuring its initial operations, CGIF will obtain a bilateral rating from a reputable international \ncredit rating agency to verify and assist CGIF's independent credit judgment of its potential \nclients and for its credit loss provisioning until such that time that consistency of its internal \nratings with that of international ratings are established.  In addition, CGIF management will \nmake specific provisions for any guarantee at risk on case by case basis based on the ongoing \nmonitoring of all guarantee outstanding. \n \n ", "Appendix 3  95 \nVI.  Management of Capital Resources \nA.  Payment of Contributions \n203.  Payment for the shares subscribed by the Contributors is received by the Trustee and \ndeposited in an ADB account for CGIF.24 The Trustee initially manages these accounts based \nupon ADB investment policies but once the CGIF Board is constituted, these funds will be \nmanaged in accordance with the strategies of CGIF management as approved by the CGIF \nBoard of Directors. \n \nB.  Objective \n204.  The primary objective in the management of CGIF's capital resources is to protect the \nprincipal  by  maintaining  a  conservative  exposure  to  the  market,  credit  and  liquidity  risks. \nLiquidity must always be available to meet potential calls on the guarantees issued so that all \ninvestments should be marketable within a reasonable time. Within the constraints determined \nby this primary objective, CGIF strives to maximize returns on the invested asset portfolio while \nminimizing the volatility of investment income. Based on this objective, CGIF capital resources \nare placed with ADB Treasury Department to manage at a fee as agreed between the Board of \nDirectors and ADB. Once CGIF is established, CGIF will discuss with ADB specific investment \nstrategies and performance benchmarksfor the CGIF Board of Directors approval. The agreed \ninvestment  strategies  will  be  in  line  with  ADB  risk  management  policies  and  investment \nguidelines and in line with the maturities of CGIF\u2019s specific guarantee operations and CGIF \nfinancial policies (as reflected in the AoA and the Operational Policies). \n \nC.  Currency of Denomination of Investments \n \n205.  As the functional currency of CGIF is the U.S. dollar and CGIF's capital has been \nsubscribed in U.S. dollars, all investments are either denominated in U.S. dollars or hedged \nback into U.S. dollars through derivatives contracted in conjunction with any non U.S. dollar \ndenominated investments. Derivatives are used only to hedge identified risks in the portfolio \n(such as foreign exchange risk) and not to expose the portfolio to greater risk than would be \ntypical under a strategy utilizing only cash securities. All counterparty risks associated with any \nsuch derivatives will be monitored and counterparties will be limited to those with credit ratings \nof at least A for short term obligations. \n \nD.   Allowable Investments \n \n206.  Any of the following U.S. dollar denominated securities may be held outright or under \nresale  agreements,  subject  to  the  restrictions  and  prohibitions  noted  elsewhere  in  these \nguidelines:  \n \n(i)  Sovereign and Sovereign-backed Securities \n(ii)  Multilateral Organization Securities \n                                                 \n24 Managed by ADB exclusively for CGIF. This account will receive payment from CGIF account (managed and \noperated by CGIF) and to transfer payment to CGIF account. The payment instructions to transfer should be \nprovided at least 5 business days prior to actual transfer date.  ", "96  Appendix 3 \n \n(iii)  Corporate Securities (excluding ABS and MBS securities) \n(iv)  Bank and other Financial Institutions Obligations \n(v)  Derivative Instruments, limited to covering risk hedges. \n207.  Obligations in which CGIF may invest must be liquid, that is, they must be obligations for \nwhich there would be minimal market price changes when sold. \n \n208.  The functional currency is the U.S. dollar and accordingly: \n \n(i)  all investments must be in U.S. dollars upon maturity based upon the use \nof appropriate derivatives, even if the currency of denomination of the \noriginal investment was in non-U.S. dollars; and \n \n(ii)  the interest rate value at risk (VaR), the aggregate VaR, the holding period \nand confidential interval will be discussed and agreed between ADB and \nCGIF management. \n \n209.  All short term obligations i.e., those of 12 months or less must be rated at least A-1 and \nall long term instruments, i.e. those over one year must be rated at least AA, by international \ncredit rating agencies. \n \nE.  Performance Reporting  and Communication \n \n210.  At  the  end  of  each  month,  the  CFO  reconciles  accounting  transaction  and  asset \nsummary data with the Treasury Department of ADB, and resolves any discrepancies and \nadvises the CEO and the CRO of such discrepancies.  \n \n211.  In addition, on a monthly basis, the CFO: (i) submits to the CEO and the CRO a \ncomprehensive monthly review statement setting forth information on investment performance, \nboth net and gross of management fees; a summary of holdings and a listing of all securities \nheld at market value; additions to and withdrawals from the portfolio; as well as such data as \nmay be requested in respect to the portfolio, including, without limitation, the rating, yield, \nmaturity, effective duration; and (ii) certifies to the CEO and the CRO compliance with the \ninvestment instructions, as defined above, and the accuracy of the reconciliation of its records \nwith the Custodian, noting any deviations. Copies of these reports are also made available to \nthe Board. \n \n212.  The CFO is required to report to the CEO and the CRO any time the portfolio's exposure \nto a source of risk differs significantly from expectations. If the CFO becomes aware of any \nviolation of these guidelines, the CFO must immediately report to both the CEO and the CRO \nand if possible, take immediate actions to return to compliance or propose in consultation with \nthe CRO, a strategy for returning to compliance for the approval of the CEO.  \n \nH.  Amendment of Investment Guidelines \n \n213.  These  investment  guidelines  will  be  revised  from  time  to  time  to  reflect  changing \ncircumstances and any proposed changes will be agreed and signed off by CEO, CFO and the \nCRO  for  submission  to  the  Board.  If  approved,  the  proposed  amendment  will  then  be \nimplemented by the CFO. ", "Appendix 3  97 \nVII.   Guarantee Risk Management System \n214.  The  CRO  will  prepare  a  CGIF  policy  on  the  management  of  guarantee  risks  (risk \nmanagement framework) for its guarantees. This policy together with the detailed business \npland and internal risk rating model will be formulated for the early consideration and adoption \nof the Internal Control and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. This policy \ntogether with the detailed business plan and internal risk rating model must be adopted prior to \nthe  consideration  of  guarantees  for  Board  approval  by  the  Guarantee  and  Investment \nCommittee  at  the  management  level.  The  following  are  the  guiding  principles  for  the  risk \nmanagement framework: \n \n1.  Prior to guarantee consideration by the CGIF Board of Directors: \n \n(i)  Corporate bond issuers must have a minimum of investment grade credit rating \n(BBB) on a credit rating scale using international technical standards in order to \nbe considered for a CGIF bond guarantee. Both the quantitative and qualitative \ndata for each corporation will be used as inputs to CGIF's internal credit rating \nmodel to arrive at the risk rating of the concerned corporation to confirm that it \nmeets the minimum rating of BBB using international technical standards; \n(ii)  CGIF will undertake a full financial due diligence of the concerned corporate \nentity and its proposed bond issue and where substantial financial risks are \nidentified, CGIF staff will attempt to mitigate those financial risks satisfactorily in \ncooperation with corporate management;  \n(iii)  During this financial due diligence, CGIF must ensure that there are no corporate \nactivities in the prohibited investments (para 199 of the Operational Policies); \n(iv)  During the financial due diligence and in consultation with the local counsel, the \ncorporate bank and the concerned credit rating agency CGIF must ensure that \nthere are no financial, legal or reputational risks pending that could adversely \naffect  the  debt  repayment  capacity  during  the  life  of  the  proposed  bond \nguarantee;.   \n(v)  In cooperation with the client's investment bank and the bond pricing agency \n(where  available),  CGIF  will  assess  the  credit  spreads  for  the  proposed \nguarantee and discuss the potential pricing of the guarantee and the resulting \nrating with the issuer and the concerned credit rating agency; and   \n(vi)  A  financial  due  diligence  report  on  a  proposed  guarantee  must  include  the \nfindings  of  the  financial  due  diligence  mission  and  its  recommendations  for \nfurther processing and issues for consideration by the Guarantee and Investment \nCommittee. If found to be within acceptable risk parameters by the Guarantee \nand Investment Committee. The report must be provided to the CEO, the CRO, \nand the External Advisory Panel. A guarantee under consideration may then be \nsubmitted to the Board of Directors and the External Advisory Panel for their \nconsideration. \n \n2.  Management  of  Board  of  Directors  Approved    and  Outstanding \nGuarantees: \n \n(i)  Establishment of a guarantee risk management system to identify, manage and \nmonitor adverse risks factors affecting debt repayment capacity during the period \nthe CGIF guarantee is outstanding; \n(ii)  Undertake annual reviews based upon the results of the required annual credit \nrating of the bond issue and monitor the credit rating results in conjunction with ", "98  Appendix 3 \n \nmanagement based upon an annual visit to corporate headquarters. During these \nannual visits ensure that the proceeds of the bond issue have been used for the \nintended purposes (allowing for the fungibility of money) and ensure that the \ncovenants on the bonds continue to be complied with;  \n(iii)  Based  upon  these  annual  reviews,  prepare  a  individual  report  on  each \nimplementation  mission  to  concerned  CGIF  executives  with  any  required \nrecommendations for further actions.  CGIF will closely monitor its guarantees to \nensure that additional provisioning is set aside should the credit of its clients \ndeteriorate; and \n(iv)  Prepare a quarterly implementation report on the status of all CGIF guarantees \noutstanding and provide the report to concerned CGIF executives, the members \nof  the  Internal  Control  and  Risk  Management  Committee  of  the  Board  of \nDirectors and to the External Advisory Panel. \n \n215.  During the initial phase of CGIF's operations, it will obtain a bilateral rating from a \nreliable and reputable international rating agency to verify and assist CGIF staff in assessing the \ncredit worthiness of its potential clients and in determining guarantee loss provisioning for CGIF \nuntil such time as CGIF staff's independent credit judgment is deemed satisfactory \n \n ", "Appendix 3  99 \nVIII.  Anti Corruption, Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing \n Anticorruption  \n216.  In performing customer due diligence, CGIF assesses the risk of fraud and corruption \nand take measures to avoid such risk, including: \n \n(i)  Checking of involved parties against public databases; \n \n(ii)  Assessing the client\u2019s safeguards against fraud and corruption; \n \n(iii)  Reviewing the underlying contractual arrangements. \n \n217.  Allegations of fraud, corruption or related misconduct (coercive, collusive and obstructive \npractices) or a lack of transparency may call for further due diligence on the part of CGIF. CGIF \nreserves the right to exclude or terminate guarantee coverage when there is finding of acts of \nfraud, corruption or other misconduct on the part of the client. Such right is incorporated into the \nlegal documentation governing CGIF guarantees. \n \n218.  CGIF operations and staff are required to adhere to the highest ethical standards. Staff \nare bound by pertinent ADB rules and procedures and staff code of conduct. Violations of the \nduties and obligations incumbent on staff are dealt with severely, and disciplinary measures \nimposed accordingly. In addition, staff found to have engaged in corrupt conduct are required to \nmake full restitution of any benefits arising from that corrupt conduct. This procedure applies \nequally to situations in which staff improperly and unlawfully enrich themselves or those close to \nthem, and circumstances in which they induce others to do so. \n \nCombating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism \n \n219.  CGIF avoids direct or indirect exposure to money laundering (ML) and financing of \nterrorism (FT) by undertaking the following measures:  \n \na.  Adoption of international standards \u2013 CGIF operations will be guided by \nthe Financial Action Task Force\u2019s Forty Recommendations and Special \nRecommendations on Terrorist Financing (FATF Recommendations), in \nparticular Recommendations 4 to 22 identifying measures to be taken by \nfinancial institutions to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. \nThey  require  CGIF  to  conduct  suitable  due  diligence  on  prospective \nissuers and other clients; \n \nb.  Collaboration with international organizations \u2013 CGIF will cooperate with \nthe Asia/Pacific Group (APG) on ML in its operational work; \n \nc.  Strengthening  internal  controls  \u2013  CGIF  will  monitor  and  strengthen \nprocurement and consultant selection, financial accounting and auditing, \nprocedures, and internal systems for CGIF-supported projects. ", "100  Appendix 3 \n \nIX.  Environment and Social Management System Framework \n \nA.   Guiding Principles \n \n220.  CGIF will formulate a corporate policy for environmental and social management and \nestablish an environmental and social management system (ESMS). Following are the guiding \nprinciples: \n \n(i)  Adherence  to  the  applicable  requirements  of  ADB's  Safeguard  Policy \nStatement (SPS) (2009) and to the environmental and social safeguard \nlaws and regulations  of ASEAN+3 governments concerned; \n(ii)  Adoption of a risk classification system taking into account ADB's project \nscreening and categorization procedure. \n(iii)  Ensuring that no activities in projects guaranteed by CGIF are on the \nProhibited Investment Activities (see para 197)   \n(iv)  Integration  of  environmental  and  social  safeguard  compliance  review \nprocedure for investments into CGIF\u2019s due diligence ; \n(v)  Establishment  of  environmental  and  social  management  system,  to \nidentify, manage and monitor adverse environmental and social impacts \nand risks associated with projects25 financed by bonds; \n(vi)  Disclosure of information related to environmental and social impacts of \nprojects to be guaranteed in the early stage of preparation and review; \n(vii)  Ascertaining  client's  (or  corporation's)  compliance  with  applicable \nenvironmental  and  social  safeguard  laws  and  regulations  of  the \nconcerned  ASEAN+3  member  countries  and  ADB's    requirements \nspecified in Safeguard Policy Statement 2009, through due diligence of \nprojects laid out in the prospectus of the corporation to be guaranteed, \nreview of safeguard plans, compliance audit and corrective action plans, \nas may be required, and monitoring reports; \n(viii)  Where  applicable,  prompt  interaction  with  the  client  in  the  case  of \nbreaching relevant laws and standards in order to prepare a corrective \naction plan; \n(ix)  Monitoring  of  and  reporting  on  environmental  performance  of  CGIF's \nguaranteed projects; and \n(x)  Appropriate staffing of CGIF\u2019s Guarantee and Investment Committee, as \nwell as plans for continual improvement of the ESMS \n. \n                                                 \n25 Projects are business activities financed by CGIF. ", "Appendix 3  101 \nB.   Environmental and Social Management System Policy \n \n221.  As part of the process of establishing and operationalizing the ESMS, CGIF prepare and \nadopt an environmental and social safeguard policy statement to the effect that (a) it will actively \nencourage and require its clients to adhere to applicable environmental and social safeguard \nrequirements that it subscribes to; and (b) where relevant client's business activities contravene \napplicable environmental and social safeguard requirements, it will take action to understand \nthe reasons for noncompliance and shall discuss with the client corrective actions acceptable to \nADB and the relevant government authorities.  \n \nC.   Environmental and Social Management System Procedure \n \n222.  Before providing any guarantee to a client, The Guarantee and Investment Committee \nundertakes  due  diligence  on  projects  laid  out  in  the  prospectus  of  the  corporation  to  be \nguaranteed  by  undertaking  the  following  steps  to  ensure  that  projects  financed  by  CGIF-\nguaranteed bonds will comply with requirements specified in ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement \n(2009),  and  the  applicable  environmental  and  social  safeguard  requirements  of  the \nGovernment(s) of the concerned ASEAN+3 member countries.  \n \n 1.   Due Diligence and Review \n \n(i)  Screen the proposed project to be financed by the CGIF guaranteed bond \nto ensure that it is not included in ADB\u2019s Prohibited Investment Activities \nList.   \n(ii)  Classify the proposed project according to the significance of potential \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts  in  accordance  with  ADB's  project \nscreening and categorization procedure.  \n(iii)  Ensure  that  environmental  assessment  reports  (initial  environmental \nexamination  (IEE),  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA))  and \nsafeguard plans (environmental management plans (EMP), resettlement \nplan (RP) or Indigenous Peoples Plans (IPPs)), or other instruments (e.g., \naudit  report  and  corrective  action  plan,  if  required)  are  prepared  for \ncategory A and B projects.  \n(iv)  For projects classified as category B review the environmental reports \nand safeguard plans (e.g., EMP; RP, or IPP prepared for the proposed \nproject to ensure that  these meet the applicable requirements of the \nconcerned government . \n(v)  Review category A projects' safeguard plans to ensure compliance with \nADB's requirements specified in the Safeguard Policy Statement 2009 in \naddition  to  the  applicable  government  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard laws and requlations.   \n(vi)  Ensure that ADB clears category A project's environmental assessment \nreport (EIA), and/or social safeguard plans (e.g., RP and/or IPP) before \nproject approval. ", "102  Appendix 3 \n \n(vii)  Ensure that clients disclose information relevant to the environmental and \nsocial impacts of the project, and consult with project-affected people at \nthe early stage of project preparation and that the views of the affected \npeople are taken into account in accordance with the requirements of the \ngovernment  concerned.  For  a  category  A  project,  ensure  that  ADB's \ninformation  disclosure  and  consultation  requirements  specified  in  the \nSafeguard Policy Statement are complied with.   \n(viii)  For  investments  involving  an  existing  facility  with  potential  significant \nadverse environmental and social impacts (category A on environment, \nIR and IP), ensure that the project complies with the requirements for \nexisting facilities prescribed in ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement.  For all \ncategory A and B projects, visit the site, as required, and conduct an audit \nto  identify  compliance  gaps,  and  outstanding  IR-  and  IP-related \nobligations and  concerns  from  preceding  activities,  if  any.  In  case of \ncompliance gaps, agree with the client to prepare a corrective action plan \nwith  budget  and  timeline  for  implementation.  Also  review  the  client's \ncompliance  with  applicable  government  laws,  regulations  and \nrequirements  (e.g.,  receipt  of  environmental  clearance,  permits  and \napprovals, consent to establish, consent to operate, etc.); and verify that \nclient  has  no  claims  pending  against  it  in  connection  with  an \nenvironmental or social safeguard-related liability. \n(ix)  For investments with potential adverse environmental and social impacts \n(category A or B on environment, IR and IP), if CGIF is not able to \nreasonably  satisfy  itself  that  the  relevant  project  complies  with  the \napplicable requirements specified in ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement  \nand the national environmental and social safeguard laws and regulations \nof  the  government  concerned,  CGIF  will  undertake  to  do  one  of  the \nfollowing: \n \n\u2022  decline to provide guarantee to such client; or \n \n\u2022  offer guarantee and associated services subject to the condition that \nthe  client  in  respect  of  a  project  shall  implement  an  agreed \ncorrective action plan including budget and within a specified period \nof time; \n \n2.  Implementation including Monitoring and Reporting \n \n(i)  Monitor  project's  safeguard  compliance  performance  on  the  basis  of \nclient\u2019s  commitments  in  the  legal  agreement,  and  client\u2019s  periodic \nmonitoring reports submitted to CGIF. \n(ii)  Require the client to submit monitoring report to CGIF. \n(iii)  If  changing  investment  circumstances  would  result  in  adverse \nenvironmental and social impacts, require the client to revise the EMP, RP, \nor IPP, as applicable and work with the client to address them. \n(iv)  Require  to  be  notified  by  clients  immediately  of  any  accidents  and \nincidents that have or are likely to have a material adverse effect on the \nenvironment, health, or safety of workers or community, including any ", "Appendix 3  103 \nremedial action planned or taken by the investment company in response \nto the accident/incident.   \n(v)  If  the  client  fails  to  comply  with  its  environmental  and  social \ncommitments,  as  expressed  in  the  legal  agreement,  work  with  the \nclient to bring it back into compliance to the extent feasible, and if the \nclient  fails  to  re-establish  compliance,  exercise  remedies  when \nappropriate. \n \nD.  Environmental and Social Management System Capacity  \n \n223.  The ESMS meet the following requirements: \n \n(i)  Integration of environmental and social safeguard review procedure in \nCGIF's due diligence of the client and of the client's projects prior to \nguarantee consideration by the CGIF Board of Directors;  \n(ii)  Provision of adequate number of staff with the necessary qualifications \nand  experience  on  environmental  and  social  safeguards  in  CGIF\u2019s \nGuarantee and Investment Committee; \n(iii)  Designating the Guarantee and Investment Committee as the decision-\nmaking and reviewing authority for the ESMS. The staff implementing the \nESMS will report directly to the Chief Risk Officer of the Guarantee and \nInvestment Committee. \n \nE.    Reporting \n \n224.  CGIF will prepare an annual report, in respect of guarantees extended under the facility, \nsummarizing the following: \n \n(i)  Performance of projects in implementing the safeguard plans (EMP or RP \nor IPP); \n(ii)   Areas  of  noncompliance  arising  from  safeguard  plan  implementation, \ncorrective measures adopted, and outstanding issues requiring follow-up \nactions, if any ; \n(iii)  Findings from periodic reviews of the ESMS, and recommendations for \ncontinual improvement. \n \nF.  Staffing and Capacity Building \n \n225.  An adequate number of CGIF staff members with the required qualification, expertise  \nand experience will be assigned to operate the ESMS . \n \n226.  CGIF will send its staff to an ADB-sponsored or approved environmental and social \nsafeguard training. ", "104  Appendix 3 \n \nX.  Human Resource Policies \n \n227.  CGIF\u2019s human resource policies are focused on recruiting and retaining highly qualified, \ninternationally competitive staff to manage the commercial risks inherent in CGIF operations. \nCGIF  focuses  on  providing  guarantees  within  ASEAN+3  countries  for  investment  grade \ncoporations in order that they may avoid currency and maturity mismatches. Because these \nrisks are high, the human resource policies cannot be compromised. The management of these \nrisks is simply too important for the sustainable provision of bond guarantees that provide these \npublic goods within the ASEAN+3 region while, at the same time, ensuring the commercial \nsuccess of CGIF over the longer term. CGIF is operated on internationally competitive terms \nwith a high quality staff that can manage guarantee operations to meet both the public policy \nobjectives and the commercial viability objectives of CGIF. \n \n228.  Executive staff will initially be recruited through international human resource consultants, \nbased upon a job description and internationally competitive salaries, but with the nationality of \nexecutives restricted to countries that are members of ADB. Professional staff will also be \nrecruited internationally, and with their nationality restricted to countries that are members of \nADB. As technical skills in financial risk management are of paramount importance for CGIF\u2019s \nsuccess, nationality quotas will not be applied to CGIF staff. CGIF support staff will be recruited \nlocally to minimize costs while ensuring efficient and effective services. Discrimination on the \nbasis  of  race,  color,  gender,  age,  religion,  national  origin  within  ADB\u2019s  membership,  and \ndisability status is prohibited throughout the employment process, from recruitment through to \ntermination. The Trustee will be a member of all CGIF recruitment panels and will participate in \nsetting selection standards of CGIF staff. Open and transparent recruitment and promotion \npractices will be adhered to as the best insurance in fulfilling these human resource policies. \n \n229.  Employment  contracts  will  have  a  probationary  period  of  six  months.  Thereafter,  a \ncontract may be terminated by either party with one month\u2019s notice, provided that CGIF may \nprovide one month\u2019s salary in lieu of 30 day\u2019s notice. Salary levels will be negotiated based \nupon internationally competitive levels. While in CGIF employment, staff will be extended the \nbenefits negotiated in the context of their recruitment, either internationally or locally, including \nhealth, education, and pension provisions through contributory schemes selected in cooperation \nwith the employee. Employee benefit plans will be set up for eligible employees either in \nconjunction  with  ADB  or  independently  within  the  first  year  to  systemize  the  benefit \narrangements for the initial executive staff negotiated with the international human resources \nconsultants to ensure that international competitive standards have been established.  \n \n230.  Salary adjustments will be based upon the level of work , quality, productivity and \nperformance in contributing to ensuring that CGIF remains financially viable and competitive in \nextending bond guarantees to ASEAN+3 investment rated corporations. Staff evaluations up to \nand including the CEO will be conducted on a 360 degree basis, in as confidential a manner as \npossible, under the leadership of the Human Resource Manager on an annual basis. \n \n231.  Staff evaluations will be based upon the agreed performance targets for each employee. \nA short list of agreed targets will be set for all employees at the beginning of each year. Where \nperformance is below target at the end of the six month review, a remedied action plan will be \ninstituted. After the 12-month period, an annual review of the employee\u2019s performance will be \nindicated in relation to each objective set at the beginning of the year in terms of percent \naccomplished (including over 100%). This will lead to an overall assessment of achievement by \nthe supervisor for the annual period. Only those that have an overall achievement in excess of \n100% will be entitled to participate in the bonus pool in relation to their base salary and the ", "Appendix 3  105 \ndegree of over-achievement. Personnel procedures to fully define these operational approaches \nto staff evaluations will be developed within the six months by the Human Resource Director for \napproval  by  CGIF  Board  of  Directors.  CGIF  management  will  forward  the  records  of  any \nperiodic evaluations in respect of the executive staff to the Trustee for information. The Trustee \nwill also have the right to review such records in respect of any professional staff, if it deems \nsuch review necessary. \n \n232.  A bonus pool will be set up using 10% of CGIF annual profits from operations, excluding \ninvestment returns. Bonuses will however be deferred until fully realized, that is until the last \npotential calls against the guarantees written in the applicable year have expired. Should any \nguarantees in that year be subject to a call, the bonus pool will be first in line to be used in \nmeeting any such calls. To be eligible for the bonus pool, a staff member must have been an \nemployee for a full year. The annual bonus pools will be disbursed to eligible CGIF staff based \nupon an individual\u2019s staff salary share of eligible employees\u2019 salaries. The detailed operations of \nthe  bonus  pool  will  be  proposed  by  CEO,  approved  by  CGIF  Board  of  Directors  and \nimplemented within the first year. \n \n233.  Staff training and skill development are integral part of human resource development. \nEach staff member is to be encouraged to engage in relevant training to ensure that skills are \nkept up to date. Staff seminars are to be encouraged on applicable topics for CGIF as part of \nensuring the development of a learning environment at CGIF.  All staff members are expected \nto update and expand their skills relative to their employment obligations to CGIF and individual \nstaff have an obligation to attend such training on a periodic basis in line with the training \nprograms formulated by the Human Resource Manager. \n \n234.  The  initial  employment  contracts  will  be  developed  in  conjunction  with  international \nhuman resource consultants who will assist the Nomination and Remuneration Committee and \nthe Trustee in recruiting and negotiating the initial salary and benefit contracts with the key initial \nstaff in line with these human resource principles.  Based upon this experience, the CEO will \nensure that Board proposals are initiated for human resource polices to meet the high level \nhuman resource requirements of CGIF on a continuing basis. \n \n235.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  This project aims to contribute to economic growth and support poverty alleviation regionally in the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations, People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) and reflects a decade-\nlong drive toward this objective ever since the Asian financial crisis. In response to the very large poverty-creating impacts of \nthe Asian crisis, ASEAN+3 governments have, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) addressed the root \ncauses of that crisis. One of those causes was currency and maturity mismatches that resulted from overdependence on \nshort-term foreign currency loans for long-term investment undertaken by corporations in ASEAN+3. Under the Asian Bond \nMarket Initiative (ABMI), ADB has actively worked as the secretariat of ASEAN+3 working groups to determine appropriate \nsolutions for these maturity and currency mismatches. Early and extended efforts went into developing local currency bond \nmarkets so that corporations would not need to borrow abroad and encounter currency mismatches. Unfortunately, the \nalternative of borrowing from local banks resulted in maturity mismatches in which the term for investment financing is much \ngreater than the term of bank loans, requiring corporations to refinance their bank loans several times over the term of their \ninvestments. This refinancing is very risk prone and could result in the bankruptcy of the corporation and even of the domestic \nfinancial institutions, as occurred during the Asian crisis with massive impact on poverty. While much progress has been \nmade in ASEAN+2 (ASEAN+3 minus Japan, whose bond markets have long been fully developed) in developing local \ncurrency bond markets, investment grade coporations still did not have access to such markets as appropriate prudential \nrequirements limit financial institutions\u2019 purchases of bonds rated below A. In the early stage of market development, these \nfinancial institutions are the principal purchasers of corporate bonds. The continued risks from the current exclusion of \ninvestment grade coporations from these markets were highlighted during the recent international financial crisis, when \ndifficult problems were noted in respect to these corporations, especially in the Republic of Korea and Indonesia. To give \naccess to corporations who have a rating of at least BBB, which is investment quality, to the local currency bond markets, this \nproject will establish the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF) as a trust fund of ADB and provide $130 million in \nequity investment to enable CGIF to issue guarantees for eligible issuers and thereby allow them to access ASEAN+3 local \ncurrency bond markets and avoid currency and maturity mismatches in financing longer-term investments such as in the \ninfrastructure needed to reduce poverty.  \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                              Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues. Financial fragility has an indirect but strong link to poverty that is particularly notable during recurrent financial \ncrisis, as occurred in ASEAN+3 during the Asian financial crisis of 1997\u20131998 and more recently during the international \nfinancial crisis of 2007\u20132009. Measures to improve financial resilience will make major contributions to sustainable economic \ngrowth and poverty alleviation in ASEAN+3.   \n2. Design Features. The project will facilitate investment-rated corporations\u2019 access to local currency bond markets and \nthereby avoid the currency and maturity mismatches that contributed to financial fragility and financial crises in ASEAN+3. \nC.

The poverty impacts are indirect in terms of sustaining growth and poverty alleviation. Nevertheless, the \ncounterfactual of what would happen in the absence of these measures could be significant. The poverty impacts of past \nfinancial crisis have been very substantial. An investment through this project in crisis prevention is highly effective in terms of \nsustaining growth and alleviating poverty in the future. There will also be significant impact on corporate and financial \ninstitutions, as crisis-prevention measures will help reduce the risks of bankruptcy and consequent unemployment and other \npoverty-increasing impacts, to which lower-income groups and women are especially vulnerable.  \n \n \n \n  ", "Appendix 4  109 \nB.

The financial analysis of the Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF) is done \nentirely on a pro forma basis, as CGIF must first be approved to be formed as a trust fund of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) before it can be capitalized and operations initiated. With ADB \nBoard approval in the first half of 2010, the equity contributions of the governments of the \nmembers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), \nJapan, and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3) and ADB can be initiated at the time of the ADB \nannual meeting in May 2010. \n \n2.  The initial capital committed at present is $200 million each from Japan and the PRC \nand $100 million from the Republic of Korea. In addition, ASEAN countries have indicated their \nexpectation to raise another $70 million collectively. ASEAN+3 has asked ADB for a capital \ncontribution of $130 million. In total, these indications amount to initial capital of $700 million for \nCGIF.  While  ASEAN+3  finance  ministers  have  indicated  that  additional  capital  will  be \nforthcoming as demand for bond guarantees is met by CGIF, no additional capital contributions \nhave been assumed for this analysis.1 Nevertheless, simulations based upon additional capital \nonly increase the financial viability of CGIF with higher rates of return. \n \n3.  While CGIF will be publicly owned, it will be run on commercial terms by a staff of \ninternationally competitive financial experts with private sector experience. CGIF guarantees will \nbe marketed and priced on market terms. That is, if the CGIF guarantee will yield an interest \nrate advantage of 200 basis points, approximately 180 basis points will be retained by CGIF to \ncover its risks while the other 20 basis points will go to the issuer to cover their extra costs \nassociated with the financial and social due diligence required by CGIF. In addition to the \nreduced interest rate costs, the issuer will also benefit, hopefully, from a maturity extension \nmade possible by the CGIF guarantee. In the financial projections, it is assumed that CGIF\u2019s \naverage guarantee fee will be 150 basis points, again a very conservative estimate based upon \ncurrent spreads between BBB and A ratings in the capital markets of ASEAN+3 minus Japan \n(ASEAN+2).  CGIF  will  be  operational,  free  to  extend  partial  or  complete  guarantees, \nconditioned as appropriate, to meet market demands.  \n \n4.  The demand for CGIF guarantees is expected to be strong for locally rated investment-\ngrade corporations, i.e., those rated between BBB and A and are now largely excluded from the \nlocal currency bond markets (for an explanation of the common credit ratings, see Appendix 6). \nPrudential requirements that protect depositors and investors generally limit banks in ASEAN+3 \nto buy only securities rated A or better, while insurance companies and pension plans are \ngenerally required to buy  only securities rated AA or better. While these prudential restrictions \nare fully supported, they cause local currency bond markets to miss segments in their early \ndevelopment. As a result, investment grade corporations, rated between BBB and A, do not \ngenerally have access to local currency bond markets in ASEAN+2. Based upon a demand \nstudy undertaken in ASEAN+2, the expected demand will rise from $3,470 million in 2011 to \n$5,652 million in 2020 (Supplementary Appendix A).2 The financial modeling for CGIF thus \ncovers 2011\u20132020. \n \n5.  Initially, CGIF will be constrained to use a leverage ratio of 1:1. Other international \nagencies  such  as  Multilateral  Investment  Guarantee  Agency  and  European  Bank  for \n                                                 \n1 The joint media statement of the 12th ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers\u2019 Meeting, 3 May 2009, Bali, Indonesia, page 2. \n2 The growth rate in the study for the period 2011\u20132016 was a conservatively estimated 6%, and it was assumed that \nthe growth rate beyond 2016 to 2020 would be 5% per year. \n  ", "Appendix 5  111 \nDevelopment and Reconstruction use leverage ratios in the 1:4\u20138 range while the monoline \nagencies in the United States generally have leverage ratios in the neighborhood of 1:50 and \nabove.  When  CGIF  is  successfully  set  up  in  2010  and  begins  to  meet  demand  for  bond \nguarantees in ASEAN+2, CGIF can approach the meeting of contributors to raise its leverage \nratio.  However,  any  guarantees  above  1:1  will  be  reinsured  so  that  the  residual  financial \nobligations with CGIF will still not be greater than 1:1. As such, neither ADB nor the ASEAN+3 \ngovernments will ever face the need to meet guarantee or other CGIF obligations, as there is \nalso a prohibition against CGIF borrowing for operations.  \n \n6.  The financial statements for CGIF have been conservatively modeled and are shown as \na simplified cash flow statement and an equally simplified income statement. The pro forma \nbalance sheet is not shown as it consists primarily of two entries, namely, the shareholders \nequity and the corresponding assets invested to meet any potential calls from the guaranteed \nbonds, as the bond guarantees extended by CGIF are contingent liabilities that are recorded in \nnotes to the balance sheet. The base case financial statements are shown in Table A5.1 (the \nsimplified cash flow analysis) and Table A5.2 (the simplified income statement). All guaranteed \nbonds are assumed to be $50 million with 5-year bullet maturities. All guarantee fees are \ncollected  up  front.  No  calls  are  assumed  in  the  base  case  scenario,  although  stress  test \nsummaries are detailed below. The estimated terminal value of CGIF is assumed to be 1.5 \ntimes net asset value in 2020 for the purposes of this financial projection. \n \n7.  As shown in the base case scenario in Tables A5.1 and A5.2, CGIF is expected to begin \noperations in 2011 and meet only about 3% of the indicated demand due to initial capital \nconstraints. However, the capital constraint assumed for CGIF under this base scenario also \nmeans that CGIF will not need to expand beyond its initial pilot level of staffing (estimated at 23, \nas shown in Table A5.2). The internal rate of return (IRR) for CGIF is 6.8%, almost double the \nreturn on 10-year US government bonds that would be the equivalent AAA rating. Of course, the \nreal returns are those that serve the public policy objectives of reducing financial fragility in the \nASEAN+3  region  by  eliminating  currency  and  maturity  mismatches  for  those  corporations \nwhose bonds have been guaranteed by CGIF to allow access to local currency-denominated \nbond markets. \n  \n8.  CGIF  operations  are  extraordinarily  resilient  to  financial  shocks.  For  example,  if \neconomic dislocation is assumed in one economy with a 10% failure rate for CGIF-guaranteed \nbonds, the resulting loss would be $44 million in 2016, as shown in Tables A5.3 and A5.4. This \nassumed failure rate is over 20 times the expected level.3 No recoveries are assumed. Yet, this \nmassive failure reduces the IRR rather little to 5.8% from 6.8% in the base case.  \n \n9.  Still more stringent stress tests are possible through assuming an economic depression \nfrom 2014 to 2017, during which 5% default loss in each of the four years is assumed. In \naddition, no new guarantees are extended during the depression years. As shown in Tables \nA5.5 and A5.6, CGIF reports losses in these years. However, the IRR for the entire period is \nnevertheless positive at 4.8%, albeit down from 6.8% in the base case. In all cases, CGIF \nreturns are still higher than the current 10-year US Treasury bond at 3.8%. CGIF is resilient to \nany potential financial shocks.  \n                                                 \n3 The average default rate on BBB bonds globally is 0.28%, as calculated by Standard and Poor\u2019s over the period \nfrom 1981 to 2008.  \n ", "112  Appendix 5 \n \n \n  1\n1\n  2\n \n \nTable A5.1:  CGIF Initial Capital -- $700 Million   \n \nBase Case   \n \n \nA\np\nProposed Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility p\ne\nAsian Bond Markets Initiative n\nd\nAsian Development Bank ix\nCash Flow Projections  5\n(It$e mmillion, %) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020             \nCCaGpIFita cl acpointatrlaib/ution                     770000                     7 -00                     7 -08                     7 -18                     7 -29                     7 -45                     7 -62                     7 -83                     8 -07                     8 -32                     8 -58            \nCGIF estimated annual demand        3,470        3,640        3,840        4,080        4,340        4,650        4,883        5,127        5,383        5,652\nExpected take-up for CGIF (%)             10             30             60             90           100           100           100           100           100           100\nExpected CGIF guarantee volume (new issuance)           347        1,092        2,304        3,672        4,340        4,650        4,883        5,127        5,383        5,652\nActual CGIF annual guarantee volume           100           100           100           150           150           150           150           150           150           150\nCallable guarantees in indicated years            -

Background \n \n1.  In 1997, at the time of the Asian financial crisis, local currency bond markets in most \nmembers the Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus the People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) and the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+2) were underdeveloped, and options for borrowers \nwere  therefore  limited.  Bank  lending  was  a  primary  source  of  credit,  but  such  credit  was \ncommonly short term, less than 3 years. For larger borrowers and in particular infrastructure \ninvestors, such short-term loans posed a refinancing risk, which is the risk that lenders would \nnot  renew  their  credit.  For  larger,  long-term  investors,  an  alternative  was  to  borrow \ninternationally, but such borrowing involved foreign exchange risk, the risk that their domestic \ncurrency would depreciate relative to the currency in which they had borrowed. These currency \nand  maturity  mismatches  faced investors  in 1997  and  1998  and  are  now  widely  seen  as \ncontributing to the severity of the Asian crisis.  \n \n2.  To address some of the root causes of the crisis, ensure the availability of long-term \ndomestic currency funding, and channel the region\u2019s savings into regional investment, individual \ncountries of ASEAN+2 have undertaken massive financial sector reform, including restructuring \nbalance sheets to dispose of nonperforming loans, overhauling bank ownership, privatizing \nmany state-owned institutions, upgrading macro-prudential oversight via revamped regulations \nand supervision, and introducing new products and businesses. \n \n3.  In addition, East Asia\u2019s policy makers have worked together to promote and develop a \nregional  bond  market.  In  December  2002,  the  finance  ministers  of  ASEAN+3,  which  is \nASEAN+2  plus  Japan,  launched  the  Asian  Bond  Markets  Initiative  (ABMI)  to  promote  the \ndevelopment  of  local  currency  bond  markets.  Another  regional  initiative  to  support  the \ndevelopment of local currency bond markets is the Asian Bond Fund, launched by Asian central \nbanks through the Executives\u2019 Meeting of East Asia\u2013Pacific Central Banks in June 2003.  \n \nB.  Asian Bond Market Initiative \n \n4.  Under the ABMI, ASEAN+3 policy makers aimed to develop both primary and secondary \nbond markets by (i) building sufficient sovereign bond issuance to establish market benchmarks; \n(ii) constructing an effective regulatory environment for the region\u2019s financial institutions to issue \nbonds to meet their financing requirements; (iii) creating markets for asset-backed securities \nand other relatively new products; (iv) increasing issuance by multilateral development banks \nand government agencies; (v) promoting issuance for funding foreign investment, particularly in \ninfrastructure; and (vi) expanding local currency bonds and introducing currency basket bonds.  \n \n5.  ASEAN+3 has focused on four areas viewed as the basic, essential building blocks for \ndeveloping  bond  markets:  (i)  creating  new  securitized  debt  instruments;  (ii) establishing  a \nregional credit guarantee and investment mechanism; (iii) establishing a regional settlement and \nclearance system; and (iv) enhancing credit rating. The purpose has been to (i) create larger \nvolumes of new bond issues denominated in Asian currencies by the private sector; (ii) improve \ncredit information on debt issuers in the region to facilitate investment decisions; and (iii) build \nmarket infrastructure to support cross-border issuance and investment. All these activities have \nbeen supported regionally and financed by the governments of Japan, the Republic of Korea, \nand the PRC. In addition, to complete activities supported under the ABMI, the Government of \nJapan has provided technical assistance to individual countries to address constraints on the \ndevelopment of bond markets. ", "120  Appendix 7 \n \n \n6.  To demonstrate their renewed and strong commitment to bond market development, \nASEAN+3 worked with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to develop a medium-term road \nmap in 2008 to accelerate the development of the regional bond market. The road map is \nconsistent with the Group of Eight 8 action plan to support the development of local currency \nbond  markets.  The  road  map  draws  on  the  progress  achieved  under  ABMI  and  reforms \nundertaken  by  member  countries  to  promote  bond  market  development.  The  road  map \nexpanded from measures to build a basic and essential foundation for markets to the measures \nrequired for improving the efficiency, transparency, and liquidity of the markets. \n \n7.  The road map entails, among other things, ASEAN+3 and ADB support to (i) develop \nderivatives  and  swap  markets,  as  well  as  repo  markets;  (ii) broaden  the  investor  base; \n(iii) address  policy  impediments  to  cross-border  transactions;  (iv) strengthen  the  legal  and \nregulatory  framework  for  bond  markets;  (v) improve  transparency  in  the  markets;  and \n(vi) develop the professional services required for the development of bond markets. ASEAN+3 \nhas  also  agreed  to  take  concrete  steps  under  the  road  map  to  improve  cross-border \ntransactions with the establishment of a regional credit guarantee facility to improve access to \ndebt markets for issuers and undertake a feasibility study for the establishment of a regional \nsettlement intermediary for cross-border settlement and clearance. Activities under each key \narea are undertaken by a task force co-chaired by two member countries of ASEAN+3, with \nADB as the secretariat. The steering group has been established to monitor and coordinate the \nactivities of the task force. \n \n8.  To advance the development of the regional bond market in a concerted manner, each \nmember of ASEAN+3 periodically assesses its own progress in developing the bond market in \nits own country. Lastly, given the importance of the private sector in developing bond markets, \nASEAN+3 has welcomed and encouraged private sector participation in the policy discussion \nrelating to cross-border bond transactions and settlement issues. \n \nC.  Recent Developments in Local Currency Market in Emerging Asia \n \n9.  The domestic reforms and collective regional efforts are gradually having an impact on \nthe development of bond markets. Emerging East Asian local currency (LCY) markets have \nemerged as an important source of funding for both regional governments and companies \nduring the recent financial market turmoil. While it was difficult to raise long-term debt in US \ndollars during the recent financial turmoil, local companies have aggressively tapped domestic \nbond markets to raise new funds and refinance, pushing corporate LCY bond issuance to record \nlevels in some emerging East Asian markets. Governments in the region have also turned to \nLCY bond markets to finance fiscal stimulus to counter the impact of weak external demand. \nTotal bonds outstanding in emerging East Asian LCY bond markets grew by 14% year on year \non an LCY basis in the third quarter of 2009 to $4.2 trillion. This represents an average growth \nrate of 19% since 2002.  \n \n10.  The ratio of emerging East Asian LCY bonds outstanding to the region\u2019s gross domestic \nproduct rose to 62% at the end of the third quarter of 2009 from 58% in the previous quarter. \nThe three markets with the most significant increase in their ratio of total LCY bonds outstanding \nto gross domestic product were the Republic of Korea (12 percentage points); Singapore (8 \npercentage points); and Hong Kong, China (8 percentage points).  \n \n11.  Table A7.1 presents data on emerging East Asia\u2019s share of the world bond market, \nwhich  grew  to  6.2%  at  the  end  of  2008  from  2%  at  the  end  of  1996.  Table  A7.2 \n  ", "  Appendix 7  121 \nAppendix 4  121 \ndisaggregates  this  amount  by  bonds  issued  by  emerging  East  Asian  governments, \nfinancial institutions, and nonfinancial corporations. Governments in emerging East Asia \naccount for a proportionally larger amount of the region\u2019s LCY bonds outstanding\u2014that is, \n7.2% of global government bonds outstanding\u2014compared with 6.2% of total global bonds \noutstanding for emerging East Asian bond issuers. In this sense, emerging East Asia\u2019s \nfinancial institutions account for a smaller share (4.3%) of the global total of such bonds, \nwhile nonfinancial corporations\u2019 account for a much larger share (8.3%). \n \nTable A7.1.

The  principal  driver  behind  emerging  East  Asia\u2019s  proportionally  larger  share  of \ngovernment bonds is the PRC. The global shares of the PRC\u2019s financial institution and \ncorporate  bond  sectors  are  only  about  half  as  large  as  the  global  share  of  PRC \ngovernment securities. However, the global share of the financial institution and corporate \nbond sectors is rising rapidly and may become dominant players in coming years. \n \n13.  When looking at emerging East Asia excluding the PRC, the structural composition \nchanges dramatically. Emerging East Asian bonds outstanding excluding the PRC account \nfor 2.5% of global bonds outstanding. The government sector\u2019s share of global government \nbonds  outstanding  is  about  the  same,  at  2.4%,  while  the  financial  sector\u2019s  share  is \nproportionally  smaller  (1.7%)  and  the  corporate  sector\u2019s  share  is  proportionally  larger \n(5.5%). \n \n14.  The major factor behind this result is the Republic of Korea\u2019s bond market. Although \nits share of the global bond market is only 1.3%, or roughly about the same as Brazil\u2019s, its \nshare of the nonfinancial corporate sector is 3.3%. This reflects issuance by both the \nRepublic of Korea\u2019s nonfinancial private corporate sector and even larger bond issuance by ", "122  Appendix 7 \n \nthe  state-owned  corporate  sector  and  a  number  of  transportation  and  infrastructure \ncompanies. In fact, bonds issued by publicly owned, nonfinancial corporations account for \naround 55% of the bonds issued by nonfinancial corporations in the Republic of Korea. \n \n15.  One distinguishing feature of the emerging East Asian bond market\u2019s performance was \nstrong growth in bond markets outside of the PRC. The emerging East Asian bond market, \nexcluding the PRC, grew 16.0% year on year. Meanwhile, the PRC\u2019s bond market growth rate \nwas 13.9% year on year in the third quarter of 2009. \n \nTable 2: Corporate Bonds Outstanding (as of September 2009) \n \n   All  Government  Corporates \nLCY Bonds  LCY Bonds  LCY Bonds \nOutstanding  % of World  Outstanding  % of World  Outstanding  % of World \n   (USD Bln)  Total  (USD Bln)  Total  (USD Bln)  Total \nUnited States  25,105  40.0  9,152  27.1  15,953  60.7 \nJapan  9,831  15.7  8,829  26.1  1,001  3.8 \nFrance  3,188  5.1  1,692  5.0  1,497  5.7 \nGermany  2,927  4.7  1,561  4.6  1,366  5.2 \nUK  1,566  2.5  1,142  3.4  424  1.6 \nEmerging East \nAsia  4,209  6.7  2,998  8.9  1,211  4.6 \nof which: PRC  2,415  3.9  2,015  6.0  400  1.5 \nEmerging East \nAsia excl.

Structure of Emerging East Asian Corporate Bond Markets \n \n16.  State-owned  enterprises  remain  the  dominant  players  in  many  of  the  region\u2019s  LCY \ncorporate  bond  markets.  Although  the  overall  trend  is  toward  privatization,  state-owned \ncompanies are still dominant in many countries and are often the largest issuers in individual \ncorporate bond markets.  \n \n17.  Thus,  the  Asian  corporate  bond  market  primarily  consists  of  government-owned \ncompanies and financial institutions. This is different from the Western concept of a corporation \nas a privately owned, nonfinancial company. Such entities comprise a relatively small part of \nmost Asian corporate bond markets. \n \n18.  In the case of the Republic of Korea, privately owned nonfinancial corporations, as \ndefined above, account for only 23% of bonds classified as corporate when determining bond \nmarket size and composition. Banks and nonbank financial institutions account for more than \n50% of corporate bonds outstanding in the Republic of Korea. \n \n19.  The major share of corporate sector issuance in the PRC is from the public sector. \nGovernment-linked companies are also prominent issuers in Singapore and in the more liquid \n  ", "  Appendix 7  123 \nAppendix 4  123 \nportion of the Hong Kong, China corporate bond market, where the government-owned Hong \nKong Mortgage Corporation, Airport Authority, and Urban Renewal  Authority are important \nissuers. \n \n20.  Private  companies  account  for  a  larger  share  of  the  corporate  bond  market  in  the \nPhilippines, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, but state-owned power and energy companies \nare also important issuers in these markets. \n \n21.  Most of the outstanding corporate bond stock in Asia is concentrated in three major \nsectors: banking, infrastructure, and energy. A substantial portion of the region\u2019s bank bond \nissuance has been in the form of tier 2 (subordinated debt) securities, which are quasi-equity \ninstruments  that  can  be  counted  as  part  of  regulatory  capital.  Banks  have  been  issuing \nsubordinated debt bonds (sub debt) to maintain capital adequacy ratios (CARs) at acceptable \nlevels, as they have accelerated their lending activities in sync with government economic \nstimulus programs. In particular, banks in the PRC have been issuing very large amounts of \nsubordinated debt bonds to bolster their CARs. This is true in most other markets as well. In \naddition to issuing bonds to improve capital adequacy, banks have been issuing bonds for \nfunding purposes as well. \n \n22.  The importance of energy- and infrastructure-related issuers explains the continued \nsignificance of state-owned companies as issuers in the corporate bond market. The highest \nconcentration of infrastructure-related companies can be seen in the Malaysian market, where \nthe large volume of infrastructure companies\u2019 bonds outstanding reflects their role in overall \neconomic growth. \n \n23.  The domination of the corporate bond market by the infrastructure and energy sectors is \nprobably most pronounced in the PRC, where infrastructure and energy companies represent a \nsignificant portion of issuance in several categories of the corporate bond market (e.g., medium-\nterm notes, state-owned enterprise bonds, and commercial paper). \n \nE.  Maturity Profile \n \n24.  The maturity structure in most emerging East Asian bond markets\u2014defined as debt \nsecurities  with  maturities  exceeding  1  year\u2014favors  the  shorter  end  of  the  profile  in  most \nmarkets. In emerging East Asia\u2019s government bond markets, maturities have been concentrated \nat the shorter end of the curve (1\u20133 years), especially in Hong Kong, China; Viet Nam; and the \nRepublic of Korea. These three markets, as well as the Philippine bond market, have 10% or \nless of their bonds outstanding in maturities of more than 10 years. Indonesia, on the other \nhand, has the maturity structure with the heaviest concentration of maturities at the long end of \nthe curve (more than 10 years). Other markets have concentrated their maturities in the ranges \nof 3\u20135 and 5\u201310 years.  \n \n25.  The maturity structures of the PRC and Singapore markets are more balanced than in \nmost other markets at present, with a larger portion of their bonds in maturities of more than 10 \nyears and a substantial portion of maturities in the range of 5\u201310 years. The Philippine maturity \nprofile has the heaviest concentration of maturities in the range of 5\u201310 years, reflecting a \ntraditional preference for issuing 10-year maturities. More recently, however, the Government of \nthe Philippines has begun to issue more longer-dated maturities. Finally, Asian governments \nand central banks generally reduced their proportion of bills (maturities of less than 1 year) to \nbonds in the third quarter of 2009. Only Singapore; the PRC; and Hong Kong, China increased \ntheir ratios of bills to bonds in that quarter. ", "124  Appendix 7 \n \nF.  Issues \n \n26.  More needs to be done to give corporations better access to the region\u2019s bond markets \nand to offer a variety of maturities to meet issuers\u2019 financing needs. For example, regulators \nnormally prescribe minimum ratings for bond investments for the companies they supervise, \ngenerally A for banks and AA for insurance companies, or in some cases limit the portfolio \nexposure of the insurance companies to a certain percentage. Moreover, there is a deeper \naffinity for investment in equity markets among domestic investors than in bond markets as \ncorporate bonds are relatively new investment in emerging Asia.  \n \n27.  The spread between bonds rated AAA and BBB is used as an indicator of credit quality \nspread, because it indicates how much of a premium investors demand for holding riskier \ncorporate assets among the four markets analyzed (Figure 1). \n \nFigure A7: Credit Spreads \u2013 Local Currrency Corporates Rated BBB versus AAA \nNotes:  \n1.  For the People's Republic of China: credit spreads are obtained by subtracting the corporate indicative yields rates as AAA from corporate \nindicative yields rated as BBB \n2.  For Malaysia: credit spreads are obtained by subtracting the corporate indicative yields rated as AAA from corporate indicative yields rated as \nBBB \n3.  For the Republic of Korea: credit spreads are obtained by subtracting the corporate indicative yields rated as AAA from corporate indicative \nyields rated as BBB. \n4.  For Thailand: credit spreads are obtained by subtracting the corporate indicative yields rated as AAA from corporate indicative yields rated as A.  \nSources: People's Republic of China (ChinaBond); Republic of Korea (KoreaBondWeb); Malaysia (Bank Negara Malaysia); Thailand (ThaiBMA)   \n \n \n28.  The credit quality spreads for Malaysia are the highest among the four markets analyzed, \nand the short end of the curve rose above end-December levels at the end of June 2009. The \nshort end of the Malaysian curve at the end of June 2009 was, in fact, at its highest since \nSeptember 2008. \n \n29.  For the PRC, spreads are available dating back only to the beginning of the year, and \nthey have fallen along the entire length of the PRC credit quality curve but still range above 400 \nbasis points for most of the curve. \n \n \n  ", "  Appendix 7  125 \nAppendix 4  125 \n30.  In the Republic of Korea, the credit quality spread has risen significantly over the past \nyear by about 300 basis points at the long end of the curve and by about 250 basis points at the \nvery short end of the curve. It would appear that investors in the Republic of Korea are now \ndemanding a very significant premium for holding riskier bonds rated BBB. This is in contrast \nwith sharply reduced premiums they accept for holding bonds rated AAA. \n \n31.  In Thailand, the spreads for maturities of 2.5 to 3.0 years have widened. However, the \ncredit spread between bonds rated AAA and A is less than 100 basis points. \n \n32.  In Malaysia, a local bond guarantor, Danajamin, was recently established. More broadly, \nlocal bond guarantors are lacking to enhance investment-grade companies ratings from BBB to \nat least A, if not AA. Limited access to bond markets poses particular problems for corporations \nwith long-term financing needs, such as for infrastructure investments that generally have a life \nspan of 15\u201320 years and from which revenues are generally in local currency. One alternative \nhas been bank financing. But loans seldom extend beyond 3 years, posing refinancing risks \nthroughout the life of the project. A second alternative has been overseas financing. But this \ngives rise to foreign exchange risk. It is the policy goal of ASEAN+3 to establish CGIF to help \nimprove corporations\u2019 access to LCY bond markets. ", "126  Appendix 8 \n \nENVIRONMENT AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM \n \nA.  Guiding Principles \n \n1.  The Credit Guarantee and Investment Facility (CGIF) is required to formulate a corporate \npolicy for environmental and social management and establish an environmental and social \nmanagement system (ESMS). The guiding principles are: \n \n(i)  adherence to the applicable environmental and social safeguard policies of the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  the  governments  of  members  of  the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, the People\u2019s Republic of China, Japan, \nand the Republic of Korea (ASEAN+3); \n(ii)  adopting  a  risk-classification  system  taking  into  account  ADB's  classification \ncriteria;  \n(iii)  ensuring that no activities on the list of prohibited activities are guaranteed by \nCGIF; \n(iv)  integrating environmental and social safeguard compliance review procedures for \ninvestments into CGIF\u2019s due diligence process and independent credit risk review; \n(v)  establishing an environmental and social management system to identify, manage, \nand monitor adverse environmental and social impacts and risks associated with its \nbusiness activities; \n(vi)  identifying appropriate mitigation and compensation measures to minimize adverse \nimpacts in line with internationally recognized standards; \n(vii)  disclosing  information  related  to  the  environmental  and  social  impacts  of \ninvestments to be guaranteed in an early stage of investment preparation and \nreview; \n(viii) ensuring  client's  compliance  with  the  applicable  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard laws, regulations, requirements, and procedures of ASEAN+3 countries \nand  ADB's  environmental  and  social  safeguard  policies  through  due  diligence; \nreviewing  safeguard  plans;  reviewing  environment  clearances,  permits,  and \napprovals; and, as applicable, conducting site visits and reviewing corrective action \nplans, as required; \n(ix)  prompt interaction with the client in the case of laws and standards being breached \nto prepare a corrective action plan; \n(x)  monitoring and reporting on the environmental performance of CGIF's guaranteed \ninvestments; and \n(xi)  appropriate staffing of CGIF\u2019s risk-management unit and operational departments, \nas well as plans for continual improvement of the ESMS. \n \nB.  Environmental and Social Management System Policy \n \n2.  As part of the process of establishing and operationalizing the ESMS, CGIF will prepare \nand adopt an environmental and social safeguard policy statement to the effect that it will (i) \nactively encourage and require its clients to adhere to applicable environmental and social \nsafeguard  requirements  that  it  subscribes  to  and,  (ii)  where  the  client's  relevant  business \nactivities contravene applicable environmental and social safeguards, take action to understand \nthe reasons for noncompliance and discuss with the client corrective actions acceptable to ADB \nand government authorities.  \n \n  ", "  Appendix 8  127 \nAppendix 4  127 \nC.  Environmental and Social Management System Procedure \n \n3.  Before providing any guarantee to a client, the guarantee and investment committee will \nundertake the following steps to ensure that client's investment complies with the applicable \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples safeguard policies of ADB and \nthe government(s) of the concerned ASEAN+3 member country or countries. \n \n1.  Due Diligence and Review \n \n4.  Reviewers will do the following: \n \n(i)  Screen the proposed investment to ensure that it is not included in ADB\u2019s list of \nprohibited investment activities.   \n(ii)  Classify the investment according to the significance of potential environmental \nand social impacts using ADB's project classification criteria.1 \n(iii)  For investments classified as category A or B, or those with potentially adverse \nenvironmental  and  social  impacts,  review  the  environmental  and/or  social \nassessment  reports  including  safeguard  plans  (e.g.,  the  initial  environmental \nexamination or environmental impact assessment, including the environmental \nmanagement,  resettlement,  and/or  indigenous  people\u2019s  development  plans \nprepared for the proposed investment) to ensure they meet government and ADB \nrequirements.2  \n(iv)  Ensure that clients disclose information relevant to the environmental and social \nimpacts of investments and consult with project-affected people at an early stage \nof project preparation, so that their views are taken into account. The guarantee \nand investment committee will ensure that ADB and government information \ndisclosure and consultation requirements are complied with.   \n(v)  Visit the site as required to review the adequacy of safeguard plans as applicable \nand the estimate cost of plan implement. If there are gaps, discuss with the client \ntargeted and time-bound actions to address them.   \n(vi)  For investments involving an existing facility with potential adverse environmental \nand  social  impacts  (category  A  or  B  from  the  environmental,  involuntary \nresettlement, and indigenous people\u2019s perspectives), visit the site as required to \nconduct audits to identify compliance gaps. If any are found, agree with the client \non the preparation of a corrective action plan with a budget and timeline for \nimplementation. Also review the client's compliance with applicable government \nlaws, regulations, and requirements (e.g., receipt of environmental clearance, \npermits, and approvals; consent to establish; consent to operate; etc.) and verify \nthat the client has no claims pending against it in connection with a liability  \nrelated to an environmental or social safeguard. \n(vii)  For investments with potentially adverse environmental and/or social impacts \n(category  A  or  B  from  the  environmental,  involuntary  resettlement,  and \nindigenous people\u2019s perspectives), if CGIF is not able to reasonably satisfy itself \nthat the relevant business activities of the client comply with applicable ADB and \nnational  environmental  and  social  safeguards  (including  that  involuntary \nresettlements are not involved), CGIF will (a) decline to provide a guarantee to \nthe client; (b) offer a guarantee and associated services subject to the condition \n                                                 \n1 The environment and social safeguard categories determine the level and type of environmental and social \nassessment and safeguard reports and plans required.   \n2  For investments appraised after 20 January 2010, ADB's Safeguard Policy Statement (2009) applies.  ", "128  Appendix 8 \n \nthat  the  client  shall  implement  an agreed  corrective  action  plan,  including a \nbudget and specified timeframe; or, (c) if involuntary resettlement cannot be \navoided, or if the investment will have adverse impact on the environment or \nindigenous peoples, require the prospective client to prepare and submit, as \nrequired,  a  resettlement  plan,  environmental  impact  assessment,  or  initial \nenvironmental  examination  including  an  environmental  management  and/or \nindigenous  people\u2019s  development  plan  in  accordance  with  ADB's  safeguard \nrequirements on involuntary resettlement, environment, and indigenous peoples, \nand  in  accordance  with  applicable  national  environmental  and  social \nrequirements.  CGIF  will  need  to  be  satisfied  that  the  safeguard  plan(s)  are \nadequate to minimize and mitigate resettlement, or impacts on the environment \nand/or indigenous peoples, and that people affected by involuntary resettlement \nreceive appropriate compensation.  \n \n 2.  Implementation including Monitoring and Reporting \n \n5.  The following actions will be required: \n \n(i)  Monitor project safeguard performance on the basis of client\u2019s commitments in \nthe legal agreement. \n(ii)  Require the client to submit periodic monitoring report to CGIF.  \n(iii)  If  changing  investment  circumstances  would  result  in  adverse  environmental \nand/or  social  impacts,  revise  the  the  environmental,  involuntary  resettlement, \nand/or indigenous people\u2019s development plans as applicable and work with the \nclient to address any outstanding issues. \n(iv)  Require clients to notify CGIF immediately of any accidents and incidents that \nhave or are likely to have a material adverse effect on the environment, health, or \nsafety of workers or the community, including any remedial action planned or \ntaken by the investment company in response to the accident or incident.   \n(v)  If the client fails to comply with its environmental and social commitments \nas expressed in the legal agreement, work with the client to bring it back into \ncompliance  to  the  extent  feasible  and,  if  the  client  fails  to  re-establish \ncompliance, exercise remedies as appropriate. \n  \nD.  Environmental and Social Management System Capacity  \n \n6.  The  ESMS  will  be  established  and  made  operational  and  will  meet  the  following \nrequirements: \n(i)  integration  of  environmental  and  social  safeguard  review  procedures  in  the \nappraisal,  approval, and monitoring procedure of CGIF; \n(ii)  provision of staff with the necessary safeguard qualifications and experience in \nthe CGIF\u2019s risk-management unit; \n(iii)  designating the guarantee and investment committee as the decision-making and \nreviewing authority of the ESMS. \n \nE.  Reporting \n \n7.  CGIF will prepare an annual report in respect of guarantees extended under the facility, \nsummarizing the following: \n(i)  the  performance  of  investments  in  implementing  environmental,  involuntary \nresettlement, and/or indigenous people\u2019s development plans; \n  ", "  Appendix 8  129 \nAppendix 4  129 \n(ii)  areas  of  noncompliance  arising  from  safeguard  plan  implementation,  the \ncorrective measures adopted, and outstanding issues requiring follow-up, if any; \n(iii)  the  findings  from  periodic  reviews  of  the  ESMS  and  recommendations  for \ncontinuous improvement. \n \nF.
