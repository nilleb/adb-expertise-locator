INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will support continued \ntrade facilitation activities for the seven participating countries of the South Asia Subregional \nEconomic Cooperation (SASEC) program,1 focusing on modernizing and harmonizing customs, \nstrengthening standards and conformity assessment, facilitating cross-border transport, and \nbuilding institutional capacity. The TA will provide studies and analytical work needed to bring \ntrade facilitation initiatives closer to implementation and ensure effective knowledge sharing and \ncapacity development of SASEC trade-related agencies. \n \n2.  The TA is fully aligned with key strategic priorities laid out in the SASEC Operational Plan \n2016\u20132025, approved in June 2016, and the SASEC Trade Facilitation Strategic Framework \n2014\u20132018, approved in March 2014.2 The governments asked the SASEC secretariat to continue \nsupport for trade facilitation initiatives and activities at the sixth SASEC customs subgroup meeting \nin June 2017 in Thimphu, Bhutan; at the SASEC workshop on sanitary\u2013phytosanitary (SPS) and \ntechnical barriers to trade (TBT) national and regional diagnostic studies held 11\u201313 April 2018 \nin New Delhi, India; and at the meeting of SASEC nodal officials and working groups held in March \n2018 in Singapore.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The SASEC program recognizes that transport and trade facilitation are crucial for regional \neconomic integration and competitiveness. The subregion is one of the least-integrated regions \nin the world for trade,4 and studies have shown that inefficient, unpredictable, and opaque \ncustoms procedures are among the primary nontariff barriers in developing countries\u2014contributing \nto high trade costs, poor business climate, and inability to integrate into global value chains.5 By \nallowing goods and services to be traded on time and with low transaction costs, trade facilitation \ncould provide greater outsourcing potential for cost competitiveness, increase participation by \nSouth Asian business and trade in regional and global value chains, and enhance SASEC \ncountries' competitiveness. However, trade facilitation in South Asia faces major bottlenecks, \nincluding cumbersome customs procedures, inadequate trade- and border-related infrastructure, \nweak capacity to implement standards and technical regulations, and inadequate cross-border \ntransport arrangements.6 In line with efforts to improve their economies\u2019 competitiveness and \nease of doing business, government agencies related to trade facilitation in the seven participating \nSASEC countries recognize the value of working together under the SASEC framework to jointly \naddress the key bottlenecks to cross-border trade. \n \n                                                \n1  The SASEC program brings together Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka in a \nproject-based partnership to promote regional prosperity, improve economic opportunities, and build a better quality \nof life for the people of the subregion. The SASEC program started in 2001 with Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and \nNepal as participating countries. Maldives and Sri Lanka joined in 2014 and Myanmar in 2017. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) serves as main financier and secretariat. \n2  ADB. 2016. South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Program (SASEC) Operational Plan, 2016\u20132025.

Geneva. \n6  The SASEC Strategic Framework on Trade Facilitation, 2014\u20132018, which has been incorporated in the SASEC \nOperational Plan, 2016\u20132025, defines the strategic thrusts and operational priorities to overcome these obstacles. \n ", "2 \n4.  Since 2012, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has helped SASEC countries address \nthese bottlenecks to effective trade through technical and financial assistance for Bangladesh, \nBhutan, and Nepal to accede to the World Customs Organization Revised Kyoto Convention, \nformulate the required legal and regulatory reforms, and develop automated customs systems.7 \nIn these efforts to enhance customs modernization and reform, ADB has shared knowledge and \nexpertise  in  risk  management  and  audit-based  controls,  advance  rulings,  coordinated \ninterventions among border agencies, and optimizing automation. ADB is helping Maldives to \ndevelop a national single window system to link border agencies\u2019 processes through automation \nand assisting Nepal in modernizing customs procedures to comply with the provisions of the \nWorld Trade Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement (WTO TFA). In partnership with relevant \ninternational agencies, including the World Customs Organization, the Korea Customs Service, \nand India\u2019s National Academy of Customs and Indirect Taxes, ADB is helping build capacity \nregionally in customs, including international standards and best practice, based on SASEC \ncountries\u2019 priority needs. While significant policy actions in customs reform have been initiated, \nimplementation frameworks and systems are still evolving at different stages in the SASEC \ncountries and require practical, grounded steps to become fully operational. Constraints include \ninsufficient use of automated customs systems, lack of capacity in customs and other border \nagencies, and the inherent complexity of introducing and managing change. \n \n5.  The lack of effective compliance with SPS and technical standards is another major \nbottleneck to trade in South Asia. Technical regulations, standards, and conformity assessment \nprocedures  vary  among  SASEC  countries;  this  variation  is  compounded  by  the  lack  of  a \nharmonized approach to applying standards and conformity assessment procedures to ensure \ncompliance. Without harmonized approaches, the development and use of mutual recognition \nagreements is severely impaired. In 2016, following a series of national consultations and \nworkshops, ADB initiated national diagnostic studies on SPS and TBT that identified SPS- and \nTBT-sensitive products and commodities; legislative and institutional arrangements, capacities, \nand constraints; and specific SPS- and TBT-related nontariff measures. The studies also provided \nrecommendations to address these issues. Based on the findings of the national diagnostic \nstudies and in consultation with SASEC SPS- and TBT-related officials, a regional diagnostic \nstudy is underway to identify the common challenges and possible collaborative actions among \nSASEC  countries.  Moving  this  initiative  forward  will  require  upgrading  quality  standards, \nidentifying requisite laboratory equipment and instruments, and enhancing the capacity of border \nagencies involved in SPS and TBT implementation. The availability to traders of transparent up-\nto-date information on SPS and TBT measures at both national and regional levels will also be \ncrucial in effectively reducing the application of nontariff measures. \n \n6.  To fully achieve the subregion\u2019s trade potential, SASEC countries recognize that customs \nmodernization efforts should be accompanied by measures to expedite the movement of cargo, \nvehicles, and passengers within SASEC. In June 2015, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal \nsigned the Motor Vehicle Agreement (MVA), which provides a subregional framework on cross-\nborder traffic arrangements. Negotiations on the MVA protocols are making steady progress \namong countries that have ratified the MVA.8 In parallel, ADB has conducted feasibility studies \n                                                \n7  ADB approved the SASEC Trade Facilitation Program in November 2012 and provided a combination of loans and \ngrants totaling $48 million to Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. (ADB. 2012. Report and Recommendation of the \nPresident to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loans and Grants: South Asia Subregional Economic \nCooperation Trade Facilitation Program. Manila.) ADB approved a follow-on loan to Nepal in November 2017. (ADB. \n2017. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors: Proposed Policy-Based Loan to Nepal \nfor the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Customs Reform and Modernization for Trade Facilitation \nProgram. Manila.) \n8  Bangladesh, India, and Nepal have ratified the Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal MVA. \n ", "3 \non applying electronic cargo tracking systems (ECTS) under the SASEC framework, together with \nsuccessful trial runs on Bhutan\u2013India and India\u2013Nepal routes, including off-border clearances in \nIndia. The studies and trial runs have confirmed the viability of using ECTS in the subregion, as \nwell as its benefits  in reducing time and costs for trade and  improving regulatory control. \nEncouraged by these results, the SASEC countries have requested more trial runs and an \nexpansion of ECTS initiatives in other SASEC countries. \n \n7.  To optimize sustainable benefits, reform and modernization of trade procedures should \nbe linked to investments in transport infrastructure, information and communication technologies, \nand broader trade-supporting services. Trade-related border infrastructure in SASEC suffers from \ninadequate  facilities  for  warehousing,  parking,  and  storage.  Access  roads  and  last-mile \napproaches to border crossings are absent or need rehabilitation to facilitate access to customs \ncontrol zones. Improving cross-border facilities in the SASEC countries would include enhanced \naccess to e-commerce facilities and more efficient cargo handling and logistics services at the \nports. \n \n8.  Recognizing  the  governments\u2019  strong  commitment  to  trade  facilitation,  ADB  should \nprovide continuing support to sustain, deepen, and expand ongoing customs reform processes.9 \nMoreover, the conclusion in December 2013 of the groundbreaking WTO TFA has made trade \nfacilitation a binding global commitment and opened up new opportunities for ADB and other \ndevelopment  partners to  respond to  developing member countries\u2019  need for  technical  and \nfinancial support to meet their commitments under the WTO TFA. A survey conducted in 2017 by \nthe ADB SASEC secretariat identified areas where SASEC countries require capacity building \nand TA to meet their commitments under the WTO TFA. These include advance rulings, national \nsingle window, post-clearance audit, and establishment and publication of average release \ntimes.10 \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: international trade and transport for SASEC \ncountries made faster, cheaper, and more predictable, while maintaining the security of the supply \nchain and promoting the effectiveness and efficiency of the institutions involved. The TA will \nsupport the momentum and effective realization of SASEC countries\u2019 trade facilitation initiatives, \nthereby further promoting closer economic cooperation among them, as well as between South \nAsia, and Southeast and East Asia. The TA will have the following outcome: trade facilitation \nmeasures to address key bottlenecks adopted by SASEC countries.11 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output  1:  Implementation  frameworks,  blueprints,  and  road  maps  in  modern \ncustoms administration completed. The TA will support SASEC customs administrations by \nfacilitating the sharing of knowledge, experience, and expertise to help apply modern customs \nprocedures and develop necessary capacities to implement the provisions of the WTO TFA. The \n                                                \n9  ADB.  2017.  Program  Completion  Report:  Bangladesh,  Bhutan,  Nepal:  South  Asia  Subregional  Economic \nCooperation (SASEC) Trade Facilitation Program. Manila. The report recommended a follow-up program to maintain \na high degree of continuity of ADB support to Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Nepal. \n10 These areas are marked as needing capacity building assistance by at least four SASEC countries. These areas are \nincluded in categories B and C, as notified to the World Trade Organization. \n11 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \nTA  will  focus  on  areas  where  country-specific  follow-on  work  is  critical  and  will  provide \nimplementation frameworks, blueprints, and road maps in areas such as trusted traders or \nauthorized  economic  operators\u2019  schemes,  pre-arrival  processing,  advanced  rulings,  post-\nclearance audit, risk management, automation, and national single windows. ADB\u2019s value addition \nwill hinge on earlier initiatives it has supported in these areas at the national level, and its \nsponsorship since 2013 of the SASEC customs subgroup as the regional platform to promote \ndialogue, knowledge sharing, and concerted action on customs reforms and modernization. \n \n11.  Output 2: Tools to enhance transparency of standards in sanitary and phytosanitary \nand technical barrier to trade developed. Building on the completed national diagnostic studies \nand the ongoing regional study, the TA will carry out a detailed inventory of SPS- and TBT-related \ninfrastructure in priority locations in the SASEC subregion, including an assessment of quarantine, \nlaboratory, testing, and metrology facilities and standard operating procedures. This will help the \ngovernments  better  understand  critical  gaps  in  soft  and  hard  infrastructure  and  prioritize \ninfrastructure investments accordingly. The TA will assist in building a database of SPS and TBT \ninformation and making it available to the trading community for enhanced transparency and \npredictability through mechanisms such as trade portals.  \n \n12.  Output  3:  Cross-border  transport  facilitation  studies  along  key  South  Asia \nSubregional Economic Cooperation routes and border crossing points completed. The TA \nwill support an analytical study of a broad spectrum of trade and transport issues, including \nconcerns of regulatory authorities, along selected routes and border points. The issues could \ninclude customs, logistics, SPS and TBT measures, and facility improvement. The TA will also \nassist in a feasibility study on applying ECTS in India and Bangladesh to further develop SASEC \ntransport facilitation arrangements. This study will benefit from trial runs previously conducted on \nIndia\u2013Bhutan and India\u2013Nepal routes. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).12 The key expenditure items are in Appendix 2. A \nfuture increase in the TA amount is highly likely as new preparatory studies and analyses and \nknowledge-sharing opportunities are expected to be identified by the SASEC countries during \nnational and subregional meetings. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB  will  administer  the  TA  through  the  Regional  Cooperation  and  Operations \nCoordination Division, South Asia Department. ADB will engage individual consultants for the \nimplementation of TA activities. The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  September 2018\u2013August 2021 \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nImplementing agencies  ADB\u2019s South Asia Department \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nIndividual: Individual  International expertise  $310,200 \nselection  (27 person-months) \n                                                \n12 The TA will use ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund allocated to the South Asia Department. \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \n  Individual: Individual  National expertise   $110,000 \nselection  (25 person-months) \nProcurement  To be procured by ADB as the executing agency \nShopping  Computers and small      $1,000 \noffice equipment \nDisbursement  TA resources will be disbursed following ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time).  \nAsset turnover or disposal  Equipment will either be turned over to the governments or \narrangement upon technical  disposed as per national laws and/or regulations upon completion of \nassistance (TA) completion  the TA. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n15.
