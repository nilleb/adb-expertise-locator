The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide a concessional loan of $30 million from \nits ordinary capital resources for subprogram 2 of the Financial Market Development Program.1 \nThe  program  supports  key  policy  reforms  designed  to  address  identified  deficiencies, \nvulnerabilities and inadequate inclusiveness in the finance sector and is aimed to strengthen the \nfinance sector\u2019s resource mobilization to improve its allocation efficiency and to enhance stability \nand inclusiveness.   \n \n2.  Subprogram 2 will build on the reforms achieved under subprogram 1 through continued \n(i) development of nonbank financial systems, (ii) strengthening of the stability and integrity of the \nfinancial  system,  and  (iii)  promotion  of  financial  inclusion.  The  program\u2019s  impacts  are \nmacroeconomic stability achieved, economic diversity and productive capacity enhanced, and \npoverty eradicated and inequality reduced, following Bhutan\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, 2018\u2013\n2023.2 The effect of the reform under the program is the stability, efficiency, and inclusiveness of \nthe finance sector enhanced.  \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The economy remains vulnerable to economic volatility because of the country\u2019s small \nsize, narrow economic base, limited connectivity, and susceptibility to climate change and natural \ndisasters. While Bhutan averaged 7.0% of rapid economic growth from fiscal year (FY) 1988 to \nFY2018, hydropower was the economy\u2019s main driver, contributing 25.0% to its gross domestic \nproduct. The country\u2019s lack of diversification does not provide adequate job opportunities for the \ngrowing young population entering the labor market. The government\u2019s Twelfth Five Year Plan, \n2018\u20132023 aims to diversify the economy by creating jobs and promoting the private sector. \nHowever, private sector development is constrained by inadequate access to finance and the high \ncost of obtaining credit.  \n \n4.  Well-functioning financial markets with strong institutions, transparent legal structures, \nand rules and regulations with the ability to accommodate the latest requirements of electronic \ncommerce would assist in better financial inclusion. Subprogram 2 will continue to support the \ngovernment in its commitment to continue reforms to make the finance sector more responsive \nto the country\u2019s emerging priorities.  \n  \n5.  This technical assistance (TA) is necessary to undertake the reforms under the program \nby helping to make the finance sector more responsive to the government\u2019s emerging priorities, \nwhile remaining stable and inclusive. The proposed TA3 will help the government strengthen \nregulations and guidelines to implement the reforms under subprogram 3, build the capacity of \nthe government agencies and financial institutions to implement the reforms, provide training and \ncapacity building to entrepreneurs and the disadvantaged to promote financial inclusion, and \nconduct public awareness activities on the reforms for greater adaptability of the proposed \nreforms.   \n  \n \n1  ADB. 2019.
