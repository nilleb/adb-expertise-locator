It is estimated that one third of public investment in many Asia-Pacific countries is \nsquandered on corruption. Because of their greater reliance on public services, the poor suffer \nthe most. Corruption imposes a costly burden on businesses and has negative implications for \neconomic  growth  and  the  creation  of  jobs.  Because  bribery  and  other  unethical  behavior \nundermine development efforts, governments must act against corruption to promote prosperity. \nFighting corruption is no longer just a moral issue. It has become a major tool in the fight against \npoverty. \n \n2.  The launching of the Asian Development Bank (ADB)-Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Anticorruption Initiative for Asia and the Pacific in October \n1999 in Manila helped raise awareness of the seriousness of the corruption problem in the \nregion. The OECD has been a partner institution of the ADB in this Initiative since its launching. \nAt the ADB-OECD anticorruption conference in Seoul in December 2000, Asia-Pacific countries \nurged  taking  actions  to  put  in  place  efficient  and  effective  anticorruption  strategies. \nConsequently, experts from 13 countries in the region drafted an Anticorruption Action Plan. \nEndorsement of the Action Plan for Asia and the Pacific by 17 countries1 in Tokyo in 2001 \nsignaled the commitment of these countries to fight corruption in the region.  \n \n3.  The Action Plan is the Initiative\u2019s main instrument and has become the region\u2019s first tool \nto unite Asian and Pacific countries in the fight against corruption. An outcome of an intensive \nconsultation process involving subject experts, policy makers, civil society representatives, and \nbusiness and aid agency representatives from the region, the Action Plan\u2019s endorsement by 232 \ncountries as of this date is an indication of the region\u2019s commitment to combating corruption and \nenhancing accountability in the public sector.  \n \n4.  The Action Plan requires each country to identify a set of actions centering on three \npillars and to report on the reforms undertaken within 12 to 18 months. The three pillars are \ndeveloping  effective  and  transparent  systems  for  public  service,  strengthening  anti-bribery \nactions  and  promoting  integrity  in  business  operations,  and  supporting  active  public \ninvolvement. A secretariat from ADB and OECD helps each country finance, develop, and \nimplement the plan. The Initiative supports participating countries in building up the appropriate \nlegislation and efficient institutions for a sustained fight against corruption. By bringing together \nmajor stakeholders and by pooling efforts from several countries, the Initiative promotes country \nownership and regional cooperation.  \n \n5.  The steering group discusses which reforms to develop and how to create the capacity \nto meet reform targets. The steering group is composed of government representatives or \nnational contact persons of endorsing countries, the secretariat, and the advisory group. Each \nparticipating government has designated a national contact person with sufficient authority and \ncapacity to oversee the implementation of the Action Plan on behalf of his/her government. The \nsecretariat manages the daily tasks related to the Initiative and takes the lead in monitoring \nimplementation of the Action Plan. The advisory group is composed of concerned aid agencies \nand  international  organizations,  and  provides  support  to  the  developing  member  countries \n                                                 \n1  Bangladesh, Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, India, Indonesia, Japan, Republic of Korea, Kyrgyz Republic, Malaysia, \nMongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Samoa, Singapore, and Vanuatu. \n2  Kazakhstan endorsed the Action Plan in 2002; Cambodia in 2003; and Australia; Hong Kong, China; Palau; and \nViet Nam in 2004. \n ", "2  \n(DMCs)  through  technical  advice  on  prioritizing  reforms  and  mainstreaming  or  retargeting \nexisting relevant assistance programs. \n \n6.  During the Action Plan\u2019s initial implementation phase in 2002\u20132003, the majority of \nendorsing countries took steps to translate the Action Plan\u2019s pillars into national policies. The \nsteps involved selecting a number of priority reform projects through which the reform goals \nwere to be achieved. The countries\u2019 reform efforts were discussed in steering group meetings, \nthereby ensuring the quality and effectiveness of the implementation of the Action Plan. The \nsteering group in 2003 also engaged in a stocktaking exercise to provide endorsing countries \nwith an analytical tool that would help them in their fight against corruption. A new strategy and \nwork program for 2004\u20132006 was approved by the steering group in July 2004 (Appendix 1). \n \n7.  In support of countries\u2019 reform efforts and to assist in building capacity for effective \nimplementation  of  anticorruption  legislation  and  the  functioning  of  relevant  institutions,  the \nInitiative, as requested by the steering group, began a series of training seminars. A training \nseminar \u2013Prosecution of Corruption\u2013 was held in India in February 2003. A second master \ntraining seminar \u2013Curbing Corruption in Public Procurement\u2013 was held at ADB headquarters, \nManila, in July 2004.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n8.  Evaluation of initial reform projects under the Action Plan confirmed that, in many areas, \nanticorruption measures have not yet been implemented. For instance, in addition to specific \ninstitutional or legal shortcomings, weak political will and capacity were identified in many \nendorsing countries as the main reasons for lack of success in fighting corruption. These issues, \nas identified by the steering group, will be addressed in future efforts under the Initiative.  \n \n9.  The stocktaking exercise revealed a number of weaknesses in the region, such as \ninequalities and insufficiencies in relevant penal and criminal provisions, and noncriminalization \nof  certain  forms  of  corruption.  The  public\u2019s  ability  to  boost  the  fight  against  corruption  by \nparticipatory approaches has not been sufficiently acknowledged in most countries, and a weak \nregulatory environment does not sufficiently encourage the private sector to adopt measures to \nenhance transparency and accountability in business transactions with public officials. The \nstocktaking exercise also identified issues that are of particular concern to the region and \nrequire  increased  attention.  Identifying  these  issues  revealed  that  a  significant  lack  of \nspecialized capacity in many countries seriously hampers the implementation of anticorruption \nlegislation and the functioning of relevant institutions. .  \n \n10.  The  training  seminar  in  India  in  2003  highlighted  the  region\u2019s  need  to  improve \ninvestigative techniques, including forensic accounting; enhance understanding of procedures \nfor mutual legal assistance within relevant authorities; and develop prosecutors\u2019 capacity to deal \nwith cases of high-level political corruption. There is a growing realization among countries in \nthe region that for anticorruption strategy to be effective, there must be a collective and unified \neffort and this is shown in the growing number of countries that have endorsed the Action Plan.  \nSince  the  launch  of  the  Initiative,  a  number  of  countries  have  expressed  their  interest  in \nendorsing the Action Plan, and the Initiative will continue to dialogue and hold consultations with \nthe appropriate senior officials. \n \n11.  With the signing of the United Nations (UN) Convention against Corruption in December \n2003,  regional  programs  such  as  the  Initiative,  have  gained  importance,  as  they  provide \npractical frameworks through which signatory states and countries to the UN Convention can be \n   ", "3\nassisted in meeting their commitments. The Initiative collaborates with UN authorities to assist \ncountries in meeting such commitments under the UN Convention, i.e. through joint training \nseminars. The Initiative will also encourage endorsing countries to sign the UN Convention to \nseek coherence between their respective reform efforts undertaken under the two instruments. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n12.  The Initiative will start its second implementation phase in mid-2004. For the years \n2004\u20132006, the strategic objectives are to (i) consolidate the results of the preceding first \nimplementation  phase  of  priority  areas  of  reform  by  shifting  the  emphasis  toward \nimplementation of the second generation of anticorruption reform efforts (ii) collaborate with UN \nauthorities to assist endorsing countries in meeting their commitment under the UN Convention, \nand (iii) enhance capacity and knowledge for effective implementation of the Action Plan.  \n \n13.  The goal of the TA is to reduce corruption in the Asia-Pacific region. The TA will seek to \n(i)  encourage  more  countries  in  the  region  to  endorse  the  Action  Plan;  (ii)  increase  the \nimplementation of effective anticorruption initiatives by endorsing countries; and (iii) encourage \nendorsing countries and other DMCs to adopt the UN Convention and assist them in fulfilling \ntheir commitments and obligations. The main outputs of the TA will be reports by endorsing \ncountries on their Action Plan implementation obligations, stocktaking reviews, and publications \nrelated to capacity building seminars.  \n \n14.  To achieve these objectives, the TA will provide i) a venue for endorsing countries and \ninterested  DMCs  to  discuss  and  evaluate  progress  in  implementing  the  second  phase  of \nreforms under the Action Plan; ii) specifically designed capacity-building programs on areas \nidentified by endorsing countries; iii) wider dissemination of lessons learned and good practices \nin  endorsing  countries;  iv)  technical  advice,  management,  and  coordination  of  regional \nanticorruption  activities  and  network  of  bilateral  and  multilateral  aid  agencies  for  potential \nsupport; and v) a network of countries and interested institutions to promote the Action Plan and \nits implementation mechanisms (e.g., new regional initiatives under the Asia Pacific Economic \nCooperation (APEC). The TA framework is in Appendix 2.3 \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  Biannual Steering Group Meetings and Project Evaluation Reviews. To ensure the \neffective implementation of country reform projects under the Action Plan, the steering group will \nconduct policy dialogue and monitoring of progress made by endorsing countries in the second \nimplementation phase. The final project review, based on a midterm review and country self-\nevaluation reports, will allow countries to learn from each other and adopt good practices, tools, \nand approaches. The steering group will be assisted and supported by the secretariat, which, \ntogether with the endorsing countries, will call for joint government and aid agencies meetings, \nor Action Plan coordination meetings4 or both. To further foster learning in steering group \nmeetings, the secretariat, may, over the longer term, work to develop a set of generic indicators. \n \n                                                 \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 4 August 2004. \n4  It will not be possible to hold meetings in each endorsing country. Selection will be based on need and in dialogue \nwith country teams in ADB. \n ", "4  \n16.  Stocktaking Exercise and Thematic Country Reviews. The stocktaking exercise that \nwas established in 2003 reviewed the legislation and institutional anticorruption frameworks that \nare in place in endorsing countries. The initial report from this exercise will be regularly updated \nin 2004 and beyond to take account of new policies and measures implemented by endorsing \ncountries under the Action Plan. Thematic country reviews will be launched as practical tools \nand indicators to be used by endorsing countries to manage and track the effectiveness of their \nindividual reform measures. Themes to be addressed by these reviews include, for instance, \nlegal instruments for sanctioning bribery and corruption, prosecution of corruption, and integrity \nsystems or ethics codes. \n \n17.  Capacity-Building Training Seminars. The steering group has identified the need to \nimprove investigative techniques in forensic accounting; enhance understanding of procedures \nfor mutual legal assistance within relevant authorities; and develop prosecutors\u2019 capacity to deal \nwith  cases  of  high-level  political  corruption,  whistle-blower  protection,  public  procurement, \nmoney laundering, and UN Convention implementation issues, among others. The secretariat \nwill aim to provide at least two training seminars per year to further enhance capacity building. \nThe advisory group will also directly support country members. Such training events will be \nimplemented  mainly  at  the  country  level  and  will  be  organized  in  consultation  with  the \nsecretariat to avoid overlaps and duplication.5 \n \n18.  Close Coordination with International Community. Direct support by many bilateral \naid agencies and international organizations, channeled through technical assistance programs \nat the country level, is an important element in ensuring progress in the region\u2019s fight against \ncorruption. To avoid duplicating efforts and to develop synergies between the Initiative and such \nprograms, the secretariat will work closely with relevant international aid communities. Steering \ngroup meetings, where key aid agencies such as World Bank, United Nations Development \nProgramme (UNDP), and a number of bilateral agencies are represented (e.g., Department for \nInternational  Development  (DFID),  United  States  Agency  for  International  Development \n(USAID),  Australian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  will  give  endorsing \ncountries an excellent opportunity to establish bilateral contacts with potential development \npartners. Relations with the UN will also be strengthened.  \n \n19.  Promoting Regional Cooperation through a Regional Anticorruption Conference. \nRegional  cooperation  acts  as  a  catalyst  to  reinforce  bilateral  and  multilateral  cooperation, \npromotes the exchange of knowledge and experience, and helps build synergies among actors. \nThe Initiative\u2019s regional anticorruption conference that takes place at the end of each Action \nPlan implementation cycle allows participants to share with a wide range of interested parties \nexperiences  and  knowledge  accumulated  under  the  Action  Plan.  Furthermore,  A  regional \nconference will provide interested nonmember countries to learn more about the Initiative. \n \n20.  Enlarging Participation in the Action Plan. To strengthen regional cooperation, the \nInitiative  will  encourage  countries  in  the  region  to  endorse  the  Action  Plan.  A  number  of \ncountries have expressed their interest in endorsing the Action Plan, attended steering group \nmeetings as observers, and requested further consultation with the secretariat to clarify issues \nrelated to their future endorsement.  \n \n                                                 \n5 In Mongolia, a workshop to provide a forum for advocates to discuss legal ethics, a system of discipline, and the \nrole of advocates in the legal system was organized in June 2004 by the American Bar Association-Asia Law \nInitiative (ABA-ASIA), a member of the advisory group. \n   ", "5\n21.  Wider Dissemination of Information. The secretariat will continue to publish workshop \nproceedings of for guidance of countries in the Asia-Pacific region and for dissemination to ADB \nstaff and anticorruption agencies in the world. The Initiative\u2019s web site,6 which is linked to ADB\u2019s \nweb site, will be restructured, updated, and expanded to serve as a tool for capacity building, \nknowledge sharing, and networking. It will contain information on member countries\u2019 reform \nefforts under the Initiative. OECD\u2019s Anti-Corruption Unit is mandated to sustain the web site. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n22.  The total cost of the technical assistance (TA) is $800,000 equivalent for 2004\u20132006. \nThe  amount  will  cover  consulting  services,  subregional  meetings,  workshops,  airfare  and \nsubsistence costs of DMC participants,7 and other seminar-related costs. ADB will finance \n$250,000 equivalent on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. OECD will contribute \napproximately $540,000 equivalent, and the Government hosting the annual conference will \ncontribute  $10,000  equivalent.  Details  of  the  cost  estimates  are  in  Appendix  3.  OECD\u2019s \ncontribution will fund two full-time international staff consultants as well as contributions toward \ntraining events, steering group meetings, the biannual conference, web site maintenance, and \ndissemination of the Initiative\u2019s newsletter. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n23.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  by  ADB  (Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment) in consultation with OECD. ADB will also consult advisers from aid agencies, \nincluding appropriate senior staff from AusAID, DFID, Transparency International (TI), UNDP, \nand World Bank, among others.  \n \n24.

INTRODUCTION \n \nOver the past 10 years, in light of the Asian financial crisis and in parallel with the \nglobally growing awareness of the negative impacts of corruption on political stability, social \nwelfare, and economic growth, and of the central role that good governance plays in alleviating \npoverty, countries from the Asia and Pacific region have increasingly attached great importance \nto  fighting  corruption.  Twenty-three  of  the  region\u2019s  countries  reacted  to  this  concern  by \nendorsing and implementing the Anti-Corruption Action Plan for Asia-Pacific. \n \nThe call for developing this Action Plan was made by the region\u2019s countries in the \nframework of the ADB/OECD Anti-Corruption Initiative for Asia-Pacific, the region\u2019s forum for \npolicy dialogue and cooperation in the fight against corruption. The Action Plan was formally \nendorsed in Tokyo in November 2001 by 17 countries. Now endorsed by 23 countries1, this \nAction Plan enjoys political backing at the highest level and is regarded as the central anti-\ncorruption instrument for Asia-Pacific. \n \nCountries\u2019 reform efforts under the Action Plan, that are based on the results of in-depth \nstudies  of  their  legal  and  institutional  anti-corruption  frameworks,  are  supported  by  the \nSecretariat through capacity-building tools, regional policy dialogue, monitoring mechanisms, \nand technical advice and assistance. Finally, with the experience accumulated by the ADB \nthrough its technical assistance projects to improve governance, and by the OECD in the \nframework  of  implementing  the  OECD  Anti-Bribery  Initiative,  the  Initiative  provides  for  the \nexchange of a wide range of experiences accumulated by countries and experts from around \nthe world. \n \nOver the past three years, tangible results and progress have been observed in the \nSteering Group. At the same time, the stocktaking exercise and preliminary results from the \nAction Plan\u2019s implementation have also identified many areas in which additional efforts are \nrequired. As outlined in the present strategy and 2004-2006 work plan, the Initiative will help \naddress these critical issues through action on national and regional levels and with a view to \nassist countries in meeting their commitment under the UN-Convention against Corruption. \n \nII.  BUILDING A FOUNDATION FOR SUSTAINED ANTI-CORRUPTION MEASURES IN \nTHE ASIA AND PACIFIC REGION: PROGRESS TO DATE \n \nSignificant results were achieved after the Initiative\u2019s December 2000 launch in Seoul. \nAs a forum for regional policy dialogue, the Initiative fostered consensus in the region on the \nneed to combat corruption and to cooperate in this endeavor across borders and social groups. \nAs such, it clearly contributed to increased awareness of corruption\u2019s negative effects and to \ngrowing public demand for more transparency and accountability on the parts of governments \nand businesses. The Action Plan, as the Initiative\u2019s key instrument to combat corruption in the \nregion, united Asian and Pacific countries in their joint concern to combat corruption and set \nhigh  standards  in  this  effort.  The  Action  Plan\u2019s  unique  review  mechanisms  and  multilevel \napproach foster concrete reform and give practical tools to governments helping them to fulfill \ntheir commitment to step up the fight against corruption and make measurable progress in this \nregard. \n \n                                                 \n1  Australia;  Bangladesh;  Cambodia;  Cook  Islands;  Fiji  Islands;  Hong  Kong,  China;  India;  Indonesia;  Japan; \nKazakhstan; Korea (Republic of); Kyrgyz Republic; Malaysia; Mongolia; Nepal; Pakistan; Palau (Republic of), \nPapua New Guinea; Philippines; Samoa; Singapore; Vanuatu, and Viet Nam. \n ", " 8 Appendix 1 \nA.   Consensus Among Asian and Pacific Countries in the Fight Against Corruption \n \nADB, OECD, and Asian and Pacific government cooperation was initiated at an October \n1999 regional workshop on corruption in Asian and Pacific economies. This workshop brought \ntogether ADB\u2019s broad development agenda and mandate and OECD\u2019s long-standing expertise \nin building consensus on major issues in regional groups and combating corruption through \nmonitoring of the OECD\u2019s Anti-Bribery Convention. The key objective of the two organization\u2019s \ncooperation in support of the growing anti-corruption awareness trend in Asia-Pacific was to \nassist countries in building knowledge, fostering policy dialogue, and strengthening regional \ncooperation. \n \nThe  Action  Plan  is  the  outcome  of  an  intensive  consultation  process  involving \ngovernment experts and policy makers, and representatives from civil society, business and \ndonor  agencies.  It  assembles  the  region\u2019s  goals  and  standards  for  transparency  in  public \nservice, antibribery action, business integrity, and public involvement in fighting corruption. Its \nendorsement in December 2001 further strengthened the unity of Asia-Pacific countries and \ntestifies to the region\u2019s strong commitment to resisting corruption. \n \nB.   Country Leadership and Reform Commitment \n \nDuring the Action Plan\u2019s initial implementation phase, in 2002 and 2003, a majority of \nendorsing  countries,  by  selecting  priority  areas  for  reform  and  developing  corresponding \nimplementation projects, took concrete steps to translate into national policies their commitment \nto the Plan\u2019s standards and principles. These country reform efforts were regularly discussed in \nthe Steering Group so as to ensure their comprehensiveness and effectiveness. The Secretariat \nwith the support of the donor community representatives provided technical advice in support of \nthis process. \n \nCountries\u2019  reform  projects  in  this  initial  implementation  phase  included  for  example \namendments  to  anti-corruption  legislation  or  the  concurrent  strengthening,  through  training \nprograms, of law enforcement agencies\u2019 capacities. Other projects comprised the development \nof new codes of conduct for public officials or different types of awareness raising or public \neducation programs. Training programs on national level were sometimes carried out with \nAdvisory Group assistance. At the same time, the evaluation of these initial reform projects \nunder the Action Plan confirmed that in many areas important anti-corruption measures were \nyet  to  be  implemented.  For  instance,  in  addition  to  very  specific  institutional  or  legal \nshortcomings, weak capacity was identified in many participating countries as being of central \nconcern. These issues, as identified by the Steering Group, will be addressed in the group\u2019s \nfuture efforts under the Initiative. \n \nC.  Common Understanding of Existing Anti-Corruption Measures in the Asia and \nPacific Region \n \nParallel to this process, the Steering Group in 2003 engaged in a stocktaking exercise to \nprovide  participating  governments  with  an  analytical  tool  that  would  help  them  clearly \nunderstand the major challenges, identify gaps in anti-corruption strategies and assist them in \ndeveloping corresponding remedies. The discussion of results from this exercise by the Steering \nGroup in December 2003 confirmed that laudable efforts were made by a majority of countries \non legal and institutional levels. Preventive measures were found to have a tendency throughout \nthe  region  to  focus  on  human  resources  management,  public  officials\u2019  conduct,  and \ntransparency and scrutiny of public administration. On the enforcement side, many governments \n   ", "Appendix 1 9\nchose  to  complement  existing  law  enforcement  institutions  with  specialized  anti-corruption \nagencies  or  coordinating  units  and  stepped  up  the  fight  against  money  laundering.  The \nstocktaking exercise also confirmed that some institutional and legal environments are more \nconducive than others to collaborative relations between civil society and governments.  \n \nThe exercise also revealed a number of weaknesses of anti-corruption measures, such \nas  inequalities  and  insufficiencies  in  relevant  penal  and  criminal  provisions  and  a  lack  of \ncriminalization of certain forms of corruption. The public\u2019s ability to contribute to the fight against \ncorruption has not been acknowledged sufficiently in most countries, and a weak regulatory \nenvironment discourages the private sector from enhancing transparency and accountability in \nbusiness transactions with public officials. The results of this exercise also allowed identifying a \nnumber of issues of particular concern to the region, for instance the repatriation of corruption \nproceeds;  these  will  require  increased  attention  by  all  participants.  Finally,  the  exercise \nconfirmed  that  lack  of  specialized  capacity  continues  to  be  a  significant  constraint  to  the \neffective implementation of anti-corruption legislation and the functioning of relevant institutions. \n \nD.   Capacity-Building Support \n \nIn  support  of  countries\u2019  reform  efforts  and  to  assist  in  building  identified  capacity \ndeficiencies, the Initiative commenced a series of training seminars. A first seminar in February \n2003  focused  on  practices  and  techniques  for  improving  the  effectiveness  of  prosecuting \ncorruption,  an  area  repeatedly  identified  by  participating  countries  as  being  particularly \nhampered by a lack of knowledge. The seminar was lead by highly experienced and renowned \nprosecutors from India, Norway, Switzerland and the U.K. and attended by over 30 participants \nfrom 14 Asia-Pacific countries. A second master training seminar on curbing corruption in public \nprocurement was held at the ADB Headquarters in Manila on 7-9 July 2004. Held back-to-back \nwith the 5th steering group meeting, the seminar provided a clear understanding of the key areas \nof concerns in public procurement and how these can be addressed. The seminars reports are \navailable on the Initiative\u2019s website.2   \n   \nE.   Transparency and Outreach \n \nRelevant documents or publications resulting from the Initiative\u2019s activities, including the \nAction  Plan\u2019s  midterm  and  final  implementation  assessments,  country  stocktaking  self-\nassessments, and seminar reports are accessible on the Initiative\u2019s web site. The web site \nfurther becomes a far-reaching information center on corruption in Asia-Pacific by featuring an \nextensive list of relevant external resources and a database on key anti-corruption actors and \ntheir activities in the region. \n \nPolicy dialogue and cooperation among anti-corruption actors are particularly fostered by \nthe Initiative\u2019s biannual conferences. Activities undertaken by the Secretariat have also included \nbilateral and multilateral cooperation with external partners and countries that have not yet \nendorsed the Action Plan. As a result, four governments\u2014Australia; Cambodia; Hong Kong, \nChina; and Kazakhstan\u2014have endorsed the Action Plan since December 2001, followed by \nendorsement of Republic of Palau and Socialist Republic of Viet Nam in July 2004. Close \ncollaboration was further developed with the People\u2019s Republic of China, Sri Lanka, and Timor-\nLeste.  Finally,  the  Secretariat  has  cooperated  with  Transparency  International  for  the \norganization of the 11th International Anti-Corruption Conference in Korea in May 2003 and has \n                                                 \n2  http://www1.oecd.org/daf/asiacom/publications.htm  \n ", " 10 Appendix 1 \nactively contributed to other relevant regional activities, such as the Asia-Pacific Group on \nMoney Laundering. \n \nIII.  IMPLEMENTING THE ACTION PLAN: 2004\u20132006 WORK PLAN \n \nAsian and Pacific governments clearly recognize the social, political, and economic \ncosts of corruption. In endorsing the Action Plan, and through national reform efforts undertaken \nby a majority of participating countries since endorsement, governments have shown their \ncommitment  to  curbing  corruption  and  collaborating  with  neighboring  countries.  Since  its \nendorsement, the Action Plan has been widely regarded as setting high standards in fighting \ncorruption and bringing about concrete changes in the region\u2019s anti-corruption landscape. The \nAction Plan\u2019s endorsement by more countries in 2002, 2003 and 2004 further testifies to the \nperceived value of the Initiative. The Steering Group also acknowledges that constant and \nspecial efforts are required in many areas to ensure that anticorruption efforts are sustainable \nand effective. The priorities and corresponding program components outlined in the 2004\u20132006 \nwork plan are designed in direct response to the concerns voiced by participating countries and \ntheir experiences during the Action Plan\u2019s first 2 years of implementation. \n \nA.   Principles of Action \n \nThe Initiative\u2019s particular strengths lie in its multifaceted and country-specific approach \nand  its  capacity  through  the  Steering  Group\u2019s  review  procedure  to  assess  progress  and \nchallenges in the region\u2019s fight against corruption. The principles set out in the Initiative\u2019s initial \nstrategy  adopted  by  the  Steering  Group  in  May  2002  -country  ownership  and  regional \ncooperation- remain the basis of the Initiative\u2019s activities. The Initiative further recognizes the \ncentral role that the fight against corruption has in poverty reduction efforts in that it aims to \nmake governments more accountable and more responsive to the demands of their citizens, to \nmake public services -in particular the judiciary- more accessible, and to reduce the diversion of \nscarce government resources. \n \nThe Initiative\u2019s central goal is to assist interested countries in building sustainable legal \nand institutional frameworks to combat corruption by implementing the Action Plan\u2019s standards \nand principles. In this effort, governments continue to have core responsibility for implementing \nthe Action Plan through country-specific and targeted reform projects, as experience shows that \ncountry  ownership  is a  key  to  ensuring  national  commitment,  better  project  targeting,  and \ngreater implementation efficiency. Likewise, significant efficiency and enhanced impact gains \ncan be obtained by implementing certain anti-corruption reforms through regional programs \nrather than individual national programs. The Initiative consequently supports national anti-\ncorruption efforts through different regional and sub-regional tools and activities. \n \nIn light of the signature of the UN Convention and the advanced international anti-\ncorruption agenda that resulted from this, regional programs have gained in importance, as they \nprovide for practical and well established frameworks through which signatory states to the UN \nConvention can be assisted in meeting their related commitments. The ADB/OECD Initiative\u2019s \nAction Plan and the UN Convention have an ideal potential for synergy due to great similarities \nin terms of involved actors, thematic coverage and goals. Both instruments emphasize the \nimportance  of  transparency,  clear  rules  of  conduct  and  effective  supervision  to  prevent \ncorruption in public service and they both recognize the key role of civil society and the business \nsector in these efforts. The ADB/OECD Initiative will consequently seek close collaboration with \nUN authorities to assist countries in meeting their commitment under the UN Convention, i.e. \nthrough the organization of joint training seminars. The Initiative will encourage its participating \n   ", "Appendix 1 11\ncountries  that  have  not  signed  the  UN  Convention  to  consider  doing  so  soon,  and  the \nsignatories to the UN Convention to seek coherence between their respective reform efforts \nundertaken under the two instruments. \n \nThese  strategic  objectives  of  the  Initiative  are  implemented  through  the  work  plan \npresented in this document. Implementation of the work plan\u2019s different components depends \non adequate funding. The 2004\u20132006 budget for regional activities conducted by the Secretariat \nin support of countries\u2019 national reform efforts is financed from ADB and OECD core budgets \nand voluntary contributions to the Secretariat from involved donor institutions. Direct support \nfrom the international donor community, channeled through national programs, constitutes an \nimportant budgetary element. \n \nB.   Prioritizing Country Reform Areas under the Action Plan \n \nSince the Action Plan\u2019s endorsement, targeted reform projects were initiated in most \nparticipating countries. The Initiative\u2019s approach toward national anti-corruption reform thus \nproved to be effective in bringing about concrete changes in the context of countries\u2019 numerous \ncompeting priorities and challenges. For the selection and implementation of the countries\u2019 \nsecond set of Action Plan priority reforms in 2004-2006, the findings of the stocktaking exercise \nand countries\u2019 past achievements under the Action Plan will constitute important starting points.  \n \nTo ensure the effectiveness of Action Plan reform projects, the Steering Group will \nmaintain a policy dialogue on the progress made by participating countries in the second \nimplementation phase. The discussion by the group of each member\u2019s selected priorities and \ncorresponding reform projects, and its midterm review of project implementation are crucial to \nensuring that members can prevent or react, where necessary, to problems that countries may \nencounter during implementation. The final round of project review, based on self-evaluation \nreports, will allow Steering Group members to learn about other countries\u2019 experiences in \nimplementing  Action  Plan  reform  projects  and  to  collect  good  practices  and  examples  of \nparticularly innovative anti-corruption tools and approaches. The Secretariat will prepare and \nmoderate this review process, provide technical opinions on country projects, and plan the \nInitiative\u2019s regional program components in direct response to countries\u2019 reform efforts under the \nAction Plan. \n \nC.   Measuring Progress in the Region\u2019s Fight against Corruption \n \nMeasuring progress in implementing anti-corruption reform by means of assessment \ntools and indicators has proven crucial to ensure effectiveness of Action Plan implementation \nefforts, to assist countries in evaluating progress achieved in their struggle against corruption, \nand to identify weaknesses of existing anti-corruption measures and institutions. \n \nThe stocktaking report which was adopted during the 5th Steering Group meeting in \nManila in July 2004 will be regularly updated to take account of new anti-corruption policies and \nmeasures  implemented  by  participating  countries.  Information  for  these  updates  will  be \ncollected at the Steering Group meetings\u2019 reporting roundtables to be used as a benchmark to \nevaluate over time the overall progress of the region\u2019s commitment against corruption and to \nidentify areas in which its members still lag behind the standards set in the Action Plan. The \nstocktaking  exercise  is  a  key  source  of  information  for  about  the  region\u2019s  anti-corruption \nstrategies and thereby fosters exchange of experience and dissemination of knowledge. \n \n ", " 12 Appendix 1 \nIn  2004,  the  Steering  Group  will  develop  thematic  country  reviews.  Themes  to  be \naddressed by these reviews include for instance, legal instruments for sanctioning bribery and \ncorruption, prosecution of corruption, integrity systems or ethics codes. Based on participating \ncountries\u2019 replies to a questionnaire developed by the Secretariat, thematic country reviews will \nrecord countries\u2019 commitments to concrete reform steps and illustrate how these are in practice \nmatched  with  concrete  policy  actions.  Thematic  country  reviews  will  serve  as  a  tool  and \nindicator  that  can  be  used  to  manage  and  track  in  an  open  and  transparent  manner  the \neffectiveness of participating countries\u2019 individual anti-corruption reform measures. \n \nD.   Helping Build Capacity for Effective Implementation of Anti-Corruption Strategies \n \nCountries\u2019 past efforts to implement the Action Plan and results from the stocktaking \nexercise demonstrated a constant and extensive need for capacity building in a majority of \nparticipating countries. The Steering Group has in particular identified areas such as mutual \nlegal assistance, forensic accounting, whistle-blower protection, public procurement, money \nlaundering, and UN Convention implementation where capacity needs to be strengthened. \n \nIn reaction to this need, the Secretariat will aim to provide up to two targeted training \nseminars per year. Similar to the 2003 India seminar, these events will target senior public \nofficials who can report back and share the accumulated knowledge with their staff members \nand other public administrators responsible for implementing anti-corruption measures. The \nInitiative\u2019s  training  seminars  allow  experts  with  similar  responsibilities  to  establish  informal \ncontact networks that will facilitate future cooperation and information exchange, particularly in \nareas with distinct international characteristics. \n \nA second key element in reacting to the need for capacity building involves the training \ntools  provided  by  the  Initiative\u2019s  partners,  particularly  those  provided  by  Advisory  Group \nmembers. These tools are implemented mainly at the country level, and are organized in \nconsultation with the Secretariat so as to avoid overlaps and duplication. \n \nE.   Strengthening International Donor Community and Regional Organization Roles \n \nMany bilateral donor agencies and international organizations are actively supporting \nparticipating countries\u2019 anti-corruption efforts through technical assistance programs at national \nlevel. This direct support is an important element in ensuring progress in the region\u2019s fight \nagainst corruption under the Action Plan. To avoid duplicated efforts and to develop synergies \nbetween  the  Initiative  and  these  programs,  the  Secretariat  works  closely  with  relevant \ninternational donor community exponents. \n \nFrom 2004 to 2006, the Secretariat will concentrate on seeking increased support and \ndirect involvement by donor institutions in country\u2019s reform efforts under the Action Plan. The \nparticipation in Steering Group meetings of key donor agencies provides a first opportunity for \nparticipating  governments  to  establish  or  strengthen  bilateral  contacts  with  potential \ndevelopment partners. Participating countries will be strongly encouraged to consult with their \nlocal donor communities and other relevant local actors when initiating the Action Plan\u2019s second \nimplementation cycle. Where necessary, the Secretariat may provide assistance in establishing \nlocal donor consultation groups or ad hoc meetings, will circulate the countries\u2019 Action Plan \nrelated reform projects to interested institutions and may establish contact with experts that \ncould possibly assist in a country\u2019s reform efforts. To facilitate this process, countries should \nclearly identify and communicate to the Secretariat the type of external support that they may \nrequire for the implementation of reform projects under the Action Plan. \n   ", "Appendix 1 13\n \nAssistance from the international donor community, particularly those represented in the \nAdvisory  Group,  will  also  be  sought  for  the  overall  implementation  of  the  Initiative\u2019s  work \nprogram as outlined in this document. The type of support sought in this context will be in-kind \nand financial and can take the form of long-term partnerships and/or ad hoc arrangements \ninvolving, for example, training seminars or regional conferences. Finally, partnerships will be \nstrengthened with regional and international institutions that are currently not represented in the \nAdvisory Group but have specific programs dedicated to fighting corruption or closely related \nthemes (i.e., Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, Asia-Pacific Group on Money Laundering, \nInternational Monetary Fund, and UN agencies). \n \nF.   Catalyzing Policy Dialogue and Cooperation \n \nThe Initiative\u2019s biannual anticorruption conferences, taking place at the end of each \nAction Plan implementation cycle reach beyond the Steering Group and the region and attract a \nvariety of actors. These conferences allow participants to share with a wide range of interested \nparties experiences and knowledge accumulated under the Action Plan increasing the visibility \nof the region\u2019s fight against corruption and Initiative-related achievements and activities. \n \nRegional conferences are further excellent opportunities to invite interested countries to \nlearn  more  about  the  Initiative\u2019s  working  mechanism  and  policy  approach.  Upon  request, \ncountries may be granted, for a limited period of time, observer status by the Steering Group or \nbe invited by the group to participate in other activities (e.g., training seminars). The Secretariat \nassists the Steering Group in enlarging its field of members from the region by establishing or \nstrengthening bilateral contacts with relevant governmental institutions. The group of endorsing \ncountries decides on application of countries. \n \nG.   Bringing the Initiative Closer to the People \n \nFrom 2004 to 2006, increased attention will be paid to equipping the Initiative with a \ncomprehensive program for external communication. Modern tools, specifically the World Wide \nWeb, will play a particularly important role, as they allow for a wide outreach and provide \ninterested parties with easy and free-of-charge access to information. The Initiative\u2019s web site \nwill be restructured, updated, and expanded. The new web site will document participating \ncountries\u2019 efforts under the Action Plan and regional activities under the Initiative and will \nbecome a key tool for capacity building, knowledge sharing, and networking. \n ", " 14 Appendix 2 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \n  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nA.
