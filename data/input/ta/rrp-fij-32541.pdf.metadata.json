The  Project \nspecifically addresses the needs of household members rather \nthan  of  household  heads  alone,  taking  into  account  women\u2019s \nneeds in on- and off-farm livelihood activities. The Project will \ndevelop  beneficiaries\u2019  capacities  and  capabilities  to  secure \nalternative  livelihoods  from  diversified  agriculture,  off-farm \nemployment, microenterprises, and improved access to financial \nservices.  The  Project  will  help  individuals,  nongovernment \norganizations  (NGOs),  government,  and  private  sector  to  fulfill \ntheir  tasks  more  effectively.  The  Project  will  be  implemented \nthrough public-private partnerships. Project preparation involved \nextensive participation by stakeholders. \n   \nRationale  Sugarcane dominates the Fiji Islands\u2019 agriculture sector: in 2002, \nit accounted for 36% of agricultural gross domestic product. For \nmore than 20 years, the sugar industry has benefited from prices \nthat have been as much as triple world prices and has insulated \ngrowers from the need to improve their efficiency and productivity. \nIndications suggest that the price of sugar will move toward world \nprices  in  the  longer  term.  Furthermore,  the  poor  financial \nperformance of the Fiji Sugar Corporation has exacerbated the \nsituation, and urgent industry restructuring is needed to reverse \nthe  current  situation.  Without  assistance,  many  sugarcane \nfarmers will be unable to adjust. To face the challenge, efficiency \nmust improve and resources must be reallocated to new uses in \nviable  livelihoods  with  minimum  disruption.  This  situation \ncoincides with the expiry of some 10,300 government-regulated \nleases over the next 25 years, many of which will not be renewed \nas  landowners  seek  to  enter  farming  themselves,  resulting  in \nhardship for experienced farmers exiting farming. At the same \ntime, incoming farmers have limited capital and experience. The \nProject seeks to address the need of poor rural people, including \nexiting farmers, to access alternative livelihoods.  \n   \nObjectives  The goal of the Project is to protect and improve the standard of ", " ii \nliving of rural people put at risk because of the restructuring of the \nsugar  industry.  The  purpose  of  the  Project  is  to  increase \nsustainable livelihoods, on- and off-farm, to at least replace those \nlost during the course of sugar industry restructuring. To achieve \nthis, the Project seeks to (i) maintain a healthy agriculture sector \nwith  viable  alternatives  to  sugarcane  farming,  (ii)  generate \nsustainable off-farm and self-employment opportunities for people \nexiting  the  sugar  sector  and  for  other  rural  poor,  (iii)  provide \naccess  to savings  and  credit  services  in  rural  communities  to \nfacilitate livelihood activities and improve the quality of life, and \n(iv)  provide  critical  farm  access  infrastructure  for  rural \ncommunities. \n \nThe  Project  has  four  components:  (i)  promoting  agricultural \ndiversification, strengthening agricultural services, and developing \neffective  public-private  sector  partnerships  in  commercial \nagriculture;  (ii)  encouraging  people  to  engage  in  off-farm \nlivelihoods to create income-generating capacity in rural areas by \nstrengthening public and private sector vocational training and \nadvisory  capacity;  (iii)  strengthening  rural  financial  services \noffered  by  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  and  promoting \nsustainable MFIs in areas poorly served by commercial banks;  \nand (iv) project coordination.  \n   \nCost Estimates  The  total  cost  of  the  Project  is  estimated  at  US$49.8  million \nequivalent inclusive of physical and price contingencies, interest \nduring  construction,  taxes,  and  duties.  It  is  proposed  that  the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) provide a loan of US$25 million \nequivalent,  or  50.2%  of  the  estimated  total  project  cost.  The \nGovernment  will  contribute  US$8.7  million  or  17.5%,  the  Fiji \nDevelopment Bank will contribute US$8.8 million or 17.7%, and \nother beneficiaries will contribute the remaining US$7.3 million or \n14.6%. \n   \n(US$ '000)  \nFinancing Plan     Foreign     Local    Total  Percent \nSource  Exchange Currency    Cost   \n Asian Development Bank  10,673  14,328  25,000    50.2 \n Government of the Fiji Islands   0    8,690    8,690    17.5 \n Fiji Development Bank    0    8,823    8,823    17.7 \n Beneficiaries    0    7,262    7,262    14.6 \n         Total  10,673  39,104  49,778  100.0 \n   \nLoan Amount and Terms  A loan of US$25 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 25-year term including \na  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate  determined  in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  LIBOR-based  lending  facility,  a \ncommitment charge of 0.75% per annum, and such other terms \nand conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement. \n   \n  ", "  iii\nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2011 \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2010 \nCompletion Date \n   \nImplementation  The  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  Sugar,  and  Land  Resettlement \nArrangements  (MASLR), the Executing Agency, will be responsible for project \nimplementation. To strengthen the implementation capacity within \nMASLR,  a  project  coordination  unit  (PCU)  in  Suva,  and  two \ndivisional  project  implementation  units  will  be  established  in \nLautoka and Labasa under the Director Extension Services to \nsupport and coordinate project activities. The PCU shall also be \nresponsible for overseeing implementation activities in the six field \noffices in the relevant sugar milling centers. A national steering \ncommittee  will  be  established,  chaired  by  the  chief  executive \nofficer  of  MASLR,  with  representatives  of  each  of  the \nimplementing agencies; other relevant agencies; and civil society \nrepresentatives, including the private sector. The national steering \ncommittee will oversee, coordinate, and monitor agencies during \nimplementation and provide policy guidance. MASLR, through the \nPCU, will have overall responsibility for executing the Project. The \nPCU  will  coordinate  closely  with  the  implementing  agencies, \nincluding the Fiji Development Bank, MFIs, NGOs, and the private \nsector.  Two  divisional  steering  committees  for  project-level \nsupport will be formed in Lautoka and Labasa, respectively, to \nprovide overall guidance and direction for project implementation \nand to help resolve implementation issues.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Agriculture, Sugar, and Land Resettlement (MASLR) \n   \nProcurement  Goods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB \nloan will be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. Vehicles, equipment, and materials will be procured \nby  international  shopping  where  the  cost  is  valued  from \nUS$100,000 to US$500,000 equivalent, and contracts exceeding \nUS$500,000 will be procured by international competitive bidding. \nGoods  valued  at  less  than  US$100,000  equivalent  may  be \nprocured under direct purchase. Civil works to be financed from \nthe proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured in accordance with \nlocal competitive bidding procedures up to US$1 million and by \ninternational  competitive  bidding  over  US$1  million.  Given  the \nsmall and scattered nature of civil works to be constructed and/or \nrehabilitated under the Project, individual contracts are unlikely to \nattract  international  bidders.  Domestic  contractors  have  the \ncapacity  and  capability  to  undertake  the  required  civil  works \ncontracts. As far as possible, labor-based construction technology \nusing small contracts will be used to provide local employment. \n   \nConsulting Services  For  timely  implementation  of  the  Project,  individual  consulting \nservices are required for a number of technical areas. The Project \nwill  employ  two  key  international  specialists  (project \n  \n ", " iv \nimplementation and quarantine) for a combined total of 60 person-\nmonths. The Project will, in addition, provide about 46 person-\nmonths  of  international  and  27  person-months  of  domestic \nconsulting services. The consultants will be selected and engaged \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement \nof domestic consultants. The Government\u2019s attention will be called \nto ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy, particularly the section on fraud \nand corruption, as stated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement, \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants, and Guidelines on Money \nLaundering and the Financing of Terrorism. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project will directly benefit approximately 8,000 sugarcane \nBeneficiaries  farmers, as well as a significant number of other rural households. \nThe  Project  has  an  indicative,  overall,  base  case  economic \ninternal rate of return of 19.1%. The core of the quantified benefit \nstream is derived from the agricultural diversification component. \nAs beneficiaries, the Project targets (i) farmers whose leases are \nstill in effect or have been renewed and incoming farmers; (ii) farm \nlandowners,  by  continuing  commercial  use  of  their  land, \ndeveloping community-based rural MFIs, and supporting off-farm \nlivelihoods; (iii) exiting farmers whose leases are not renewed, \nwho will be helped by off-farm livelihoods, microenterprises, rural \nfinancial  services,  and  support  in  finding  new  farms;  and  (iv) \nsugarcane cutters and mill workers who lost their jobs, who will be \nhelped  by  off-farm  livelihoods,  microenterprises,  rural  financial \nservices, and new on-farm employment in diversified and high-\nvalue agriculture. The inclusive approach and the development of \ninstitutional capacity and processes will create benefits for the \npoor outside these target groups through better service delivery, \npublic-private  cooperation,  and  strengthened  NGOs  and \ncooperatives. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  mixed  success  of  past  ADB-  and  externally-supported \nagriculture projects was due to the limited institutional capacity of \nthe implementing agencies. To address this, the Project includes \ncapacity building measures, and outputs are often in the form of \nimproved institutional effectiveness. A strong PCU is envisaged, \nincluding field offices, to coordinate, support, and monitor at a \nlocal level. \n \nThe dominance of sugar, a commodity crop sold to a single buyer \nat  higher-than-world  prices,  has  left  farmers  dependent  on  a \nsingle,  regulated  buyer  and  with  little  incentive  or  capacity  to \ninnovate, market, or manage as needed in diversified, commercial \nfarming and off-farm livelihoods. Thus, the Project builds on the \ntraditional farm diversity, diversification, and adoption experience \nof  innovative  farmers  and  agribusinesses,  providing  technical \nsupport and skills development, including an emphasis on farm \nbusiness management services and support to strengthen farmer \ngroups and industry organizations.  \n  ", "  v\n \nAdequate land needs to be made available on terms agreeable to \nboth farmers and landowners. Land is communally owned, so \nalmost all farmers are tenants. Indigenous Fijian farmers usually \nfarm as tenants of a clan (mataqali) rather than as owners, even if \nthey are members of the clan. Positive trends are apparent in \nlease renewals, even though political disagreement remains about \nthe  legal  form  of  agricultural  leases.  Nevertheless,  the  Native \nLand Trust Board has provided assurance that it will support lease \nrenewals and, where landowners do not wish to renew leases, will \nseek alternative farms. \n \nThe  success  of  the  agriculture  diversification  component  will \ndepend  on  the  industry  organizations\u2019  ability  to  manage  and \nprovide the necessary support to farmers for a wider adoption \nrate,  and  the  mobilization  of  private  sector  participation  and \ninvestment. The lack of financial services and credit support to \nproject participants also poses a risk. \n \nThe Fiji Islands\u2019 horticultural exports would be at risk from the \narrival of a new, foreign fruit fly, but quarantine safeguards are not \nfully enforced because of budgetary constraints. The Project will \nstrengthen quarantine services and will require assurance that the \nGovernment will enforce safeguards. \n \nTypical agricultural risks due to weather and existing pest and \ndisease pressures are not expected to affect the Project, because \nfarmers  have  been  working  with  these  conditions  for  many \ndecades.  Rather,  by  diversifying  agriculture,  avoiding  the \nundermining of traditional household strategies in relation to food \nsecurity, and providing appropriate training opportunities (e.g., in \nintegrated pest management), the risk of drastic impacts on food \nand income from these pressures are expected to be lessened. \n  \nSuccessful implementation in Vanua Levu requires development \nof the port at Savusavu (under separate funding). \n   \nTechnical Assistance  Technical  assistance  (TA)  is  proposed  to  support  the \nstrengthening of commercial agriculture development to ensure \nthat appropriate policies, institutions, and capacities are in place \nat project completion to sustain the performance of the private \nagriculture sector. The TA will strengthen the private sector so \nthat  it  can  take  the  leading  role  in  developing  and  promoting \nagribusiness. In addition to developing the policy and legislative \nenvironment,  the  TA  will  facilitate  the  development  of  self-\nsustaining  industry  organizations  with  a  medium-  to  long-term \nstrategic and entrepreneurial vision that can raise funds, manage \ntheir  operations,  and  provide  effective  services  to  the  farming \ncommunity. The TA will (i) help the industry organizations apply \nfunding criteria to activity proposals; (ii) assist in establishing the \noperations,  linkages,  and  strategic  focus  of  farm  business \n  \n ", " vi \nadvisory services; (iii) assist in orienting trade- and market-related \nlegislation, information, services, protocols, and relationships; (iv) \nfacilitate institutional linkages and networks between the Fijian \nagriculture sector, private and public organizations, and programs \nactive in the region; (v) support training in agribusiness and agro-\nprocessing;  and  (vi)  raise  potential  local  entrepreneurs\u2019  and \nindustry organizations\u2019 awareness of business opportunities. \n \n \n  ", "  \n \n \nv\nii", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Fiji Islands for the Alternative Livelihoods Development Project. The report also describes \nproposed technical assistance (TA) for Strengthening Commercial Agriculture Development, \nand if the Board approves the proposed loan, I, acting under the authority delegated to me by \nthe Board, will approve the TA. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n \n2.  The Fiji Islands\u2019 rural economy is dominated by sugarcane and subsistence farming, \nwhich accounted for 36% and 35%, respectively, of agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) \nin 2002. However, these figures understate the importance of sugarcane production, a cash \ncrop that accounts for about 60% of farm incomes, with other cash crops and off-farm income \ncontributing about 20% each. Subsistence farming, forestry, and livestock provide noncash or \ndelayed benefits, but have traditionally provided farm households with a range of household \nneeds and with resilience to political upheavals, tropical cyclones, and other shocks. \n \n3.  Sugarcane farms in the project area are small, averaging about 4 hectares (ha). The \nestimated annual gross margin of a representative sugarcane farm is F$2,070 (US$1,063) at \ncurrent sugarcane prices of F$50 (US$25.70)/metric ton (t), compared with the household \npoverty threshold of F$6,500 (US$3,340)/year. A projected fall in sugarcane prices to F$37 \n(US$19)/t risks reducing annual gross margins to less than F$1,000 (US$514). About 17,000 \nseasonal  sugarcane  cutters  earn  an  average  of  F$900  (US$462)  per  season,  and  these \nincomes  are  at  risk  through  reductions  in  the  sugarcane  area  and  moves  to  mechanical \nharvesting. To protect the already poor groups from further income reductions as a result of the \nrestructuring of the sugar industry, diversified, higher-value farming systems must be promoted \nand off-farm livelihood opportunities to supplement or replace agricultural incomes must be \nprovided. \n \n4.  The expiry of some 10,300 farms leases over the next 25 years (about 2,800 leases will \nexpire by 2008) will result in experienced farmers leaving the sugar industry and new farmers \nentering  with  limited  capital  and  experience.  The  industry\u2019s  dominance  was  boosted  by \npreferential prices supported by the European Union (EU) at up to three times world market \nprices. These subsidies have distorted resource use toward sugar and allowed a formerly world-\nclass  industry  to  develop  inefficient  practices  and  standards.  However,  since  1995,  EU \npreferential prices have fallen from US$0.30/US pound (lb) to US$0.20/lb, and in 2002, world \nprices dropped from about US$0.12/lb to US$0.07/lb. In addition, the efficiency of the Fiji \nIslands\u2019 sugar sector has continued to decline and its costs to rise. Overall farm and mill \nperformance has decreased by 26%, as reflected in the tons of sugar produced per hectare, \nwhich deteriorated from a 1970s average of 6.74 t/ha to 5.89 t/ha in the 1990s, and has \nworsened to 4.96 t/ha since 2000. Sugarcane yields of about 45 t/ha have stagnated since the \n1970s, and mill recovery fell from 86.3% in the 1970s to 78% in 2002, while mill time efficiency \ndropped  from  94%  in  the  1970s  to  84%  in  2002.  These  figures  reflect  an  overall  and \naccelerating deterioration in farming, harvesting, transport, and mill performance at a time of \nfalling prices, clearly reflected in the Fiji Sugar Corporation\u2019s (FSC's) financial performance. In \nthe early 1990s, the FSC's sugar prices increased by 4% per year, but milling costs increased \nby 9% per year. In the 1980s, the FSC's 30% share of sugar proceeds yielded average profits of \n55% of mill costs, but these fell to an average loss of 3% in the late 1990s, a loss of 23% in \n2000,  and  accelerating  losses  thereafter.  This  situation  is  unsustainable,  requiring  urgent \nrestructuring to reverse past deterioration in mill and farm performance and improve yields. \n ", "2   \n5.  In  addition  to  this  immediate  need  to  restructure  the  sugar  sector,  the  prospective \nchanges in the EU sugar regime reinforce the need for the sector to become efficient and \ncompetitive. The EU countries, principally France and Germany, produce substantial surpluses \nof beet sugar and store or export some 6 million to 7 million t each year. They sell exports at \nworld prices depressed by oversupply, but some 3 million t of EU sugar exports attract a \nsubsidy funded by levies on EU consumers. Under World Trade Organization (WTO) ceilings, \nthe quantity of exports that the EU can subsidize is now limited to a volume equal to the \npreferential imports from African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries plus 1.27 million t. \nThis requires the EU to withdraw subsidies from exports at the expense of EU farmers. The \nWTO link to ACP imports limits the EU's ability to reduce exports at the expense of ACP \nimports. However, this and the internal market need to constrain the costs of agricultural policy, \nas agreed to by EU agriculture ministers in Berlin in 1999, mean that the price of EU sugar is \nlikely to be reduced to force reduced beet production. Studies indicate that to encourage EU \nfarmers to diversify, prices must fall by about 50%.  \n \n6.  In parallel with this probable reduction in prices, the Fiji Islands also faces the risk of a \nloss of EU quotas. Under the Everything But Arms initiative, from 2009 less developed countries \nwill be able to export sugar to the EU without quotas or tariffs. Conservative estimates suggest \nthat these countries will supply 0.9 million to 1.3 million t of sugarcane per year, about the same \nas current ACP supplies. Apart from an annual demand of some 0.3 million t of sugarcane for \nFrench refineries, which French overseas territories supply, the EU's demand for sugarcane is \neffectively limited to the United Kingdom (UK) company Tate & Lyle, which requires 1.4 million t \nof sugarcane per year for its EU refineries. Unless Tate & Lyle invests in increased sugarcane \ncapacity, in an EU market with excess beet sugar capacity, the risk exists that countries under \nthe Everything But Arms agreement will meet the entire demand for sugarcane in the EU, and \nthere will be no or minimal quotas for other ACP countries, such as the Fiji Islands. Thus in \naddition to the immediate financial crisis facing the FSC, restructuring would be a prudent move \nto enable the sector to compete in world markets by 2010. \n \n7.  The  survival  of  the  Fijian  sugar  industry  depends  on  improving  efficiency  and \nproductivity. Projections suggest that average yields must rise by 56%, from 45 t/ha to more \nthan 70 t/ha, to maintain farm incomes. Currently yields exceed 70 t/ha on more than 3,600 \nfarms, but this level is unlikely to be sustained on about 20% of the land, which is either steep \nwith poor soils or is cultivated by farmers unwilling to invest further in sugarcane farming. \nAssuming improved capacity utilization by 2008, at the projected higher yield from about 50,000 \nha would satisfy the projected mill demand. While doubts about whether the sugar industry \nrestructuring will be successful are considerable, some 19,200 ha of sugarcane areas are likely \nto be available for alternative activities. \n \n8.  Most farms are diversified to some extent, and restructuring will result in more small \nproducers leaving the industry and larger farms reducing their sugarcane areas in favor of other \nhigher-value cash crops. Some seasonal sugarcane cutters will exit the industry, but many will \nfind  work  in  the  diversified  farming  systems,  such  as  those  focusing  on  horticulture  and \nlivestock,  which  are  usually  more  labor  intensive.  In  addition,  political  leaders  are  making \nprogress in resolving land tenure issues. Overall, the rate of lease renewals is likely to increase, \nalthough a certain level of nonrenewals will persist, because of landowners\u2019 desire to enter into \nfarming to improve their own livelihoods. The Government and the Native Land Trust Board \n(NLTB) have assured that alternative lands will be made available for leasing for agricultural \npurposes. Appendix 1 provides an analysis of the rural sector and Appendix 2 summarizes the \nagricultural lease renewal situation. \n \n9.  While reliable data are scarce, the indicators in Table 1 illustrate the current situation of \nsugarcane farmers and the likelihood that they will be able to move into alternative livelihoods.  \n  ", "    3\n \n \nTable 1: Indicators of Rural Conditions  \nIndicator  Current Situation and Performance \nRural poverty  Current estimates indicate that more than 40% of about 300,000 people in the Western \nand Northern divisions subsist below the poverty line of US$60/household/week, \nUS$624/capita/year, or US$3,120/household/year. \nLivelihood Vulnerability \nReliance on sugarcane for the About 21,000 families rely directly on sugarcane farming. Average sugarcane farming \nbulk of farm household  households at or below the poverty line obtain cash income equivalent to about 60% of \nincome  their total income from sugarcane. Other cash crops contribute 20% and off-farm income \naccounts for another 20%.  \nLow sugarcane yields  Average current yield is 45 t/ha at a price of US$26.3/t in 2003. Projected farm budgets \nthreaten farm viability as the  using a price of US$18/t in 2008 suggest that farms must achieve yields of more than 70 \nprice of sugarcane falls  t/ha to sustain comparable net returns. \nExpiring leases are displacing Expiry of leases began in 1997, when landowners renewed 54% of leases to sitting \nfarm families and creating  tenants. Such renewals fell to 19% in 2000 at the time of a coup, but following resolution \ntenantless farms  of the conflict, renewals rose to 44% in 2001. Many farms with expired leases are vacant, \nresulting in a loss of incomes on the part of both farmers and landlords. Landowners now \nappear to be increasing the rate of renewals, but are reluctant to renew leases under the \nAgricultural Landlord and Tenant Act (Appendix 2).  \nReduction in number of  In January 2003, Fiji Islands had 21,371 registered farms totaling 79,200 ha, of which \nsugarcane farms and area  64,000 ha were planted with sugarcane. By 2008, with yield increases and milling \nplanted to sugarcane  capacity improvements, the required area will fall to 50,000 ha, and roughly 3,800 farms \n  could fully exit from sugarcane farming, although in practice, a much larger number of \nsugarcane farmers are expected to diversify from sugarcane and use some of their land \nto grow other crops (Appendix 2). \nAgricultural Diversification \nContribution of the agriculture If diversification is to be successfully achieved with the least overall hardship, agriculture\u2019s \nsector   contribution to GDP will need to be maintained despite a declining value of sugar. \nFarmers\u2019 limited commercial  Farms have not been managed as market-led enterprises.

Support could increase this to 6,000 to \n7,000 enterprises and create 4,000 new jobs. \nLimited Rural Finance  Agricultural lending outstanding as of June 2001 was US$48.7 million to 12,602 \nborrowers. Sugarcane farmers account for 92% of agricultural borrowers and \nnonsugarcane farm households account for just 8%. The Fiji Development Bank and \ncommercial banks have reduced rural lending, and the development of microfinance \ninstitutions has been hindered because of the lack of capacity and support to expand \noutreach. \nInadequate Infrastructure  Infrastructure in Vanua Levu is poor, constraining social and economic development. Bulk \nhandling port facilities exist for some commodities, but no general port facility\u2014serviced \nby international general cargo carriers\u2014is available to support diversified agriculture, off- \nfarm activities, and agro-industry development. Improved roads, electrification, and water \nsupply are highly desirable in support of project activities in Vanua Levu, and an \ninternational general cargo port in Vanua Levu is critical to support the Project and only \nSavusavu port is currently served by general cargo ships. \nGDP = gross domestic product, t/ha = tons/hectare. \na According to the 1996 census, Fiji Islands' industry employs 13% of the total labor force of about 187,689 \neconomically active people over the age of 15.

While sugar sector restructuring will cause some farmers to exit, most are expected to \ntake  the  opportunity  to  gradually  increase  the  scale,  intensity,  and  diversity  of  their  farm \nenterprises;  however,  their  ability  to  do  so  with  minimum  disruption  is  constrained  by  the \ndifficulties they face in accessing markets for nonsugar agricultural products, improved farming \ntechnologies,  off-farm  opportunities,  and  rural  finance.  While  Fiji  Islands\u2019  traditional \ncommodities\u2014sugar and copra\u2014are struggling, horticultural exports are performing better. To \nidentify  alternatives  to  sugar  and  copra,  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  undertook  a \ncomprehensive review of the agriculture sector in 1995.1 During project preparation, this study \nwas reviewed and market prospects were further investigated.  \n \n11.  The  agriculture  sector  has  the  potential  and  basic  capacity  to  diversify.  Market \nopportunities for which a marketing structure is already in place include (i) exporting to Indo-\nFijian, Asian, and Pacific island communities in Australia and New Zealand; and (ii) supplying \nthe expanding urban, agribusiness, and local tourism markets. The Fiji Islands exports fresh \nfruits, vegetables, taro, and other products to regular buyers in Auckland, Brisbane, Melbourne, \nand Sydney. For example, in 2001, under a fruit fly-host bilateral quarantine agreement (BQA), \nFiji Islands exported 475 t of papaya, mango, eggplant, and breadfruit valued at US$510,000 to \nAuckland via the Nature\u2019s Way Export Treatment Cooperative in Nadi.2 The scope exists to \nincrease the volume, diversity, and duration of supply to both domestic and export markets. The \nhousehold survey that was part of the project preparatory TA found that 21% of farms obtain \ncash income from nonsugar farm production and that stakeholders were extremely interested in \ndiversification, with successful examples existing in the project areas. Diversified farms and \nagribusinesses obtain at least 50% of their cash income from specialized or mixed farming of \nnonsugar products, including fruits and vegetables (500 farms), root crops (400 farms), grains \nand pulses (100 farms), livestock (500 farms), agro forestry (200 farms), and spices (30 farms).3 \nThese early adopters demonstrate the capacity to manage relatively sophisticated private sector \noperations including specialized cultivation, contract farming, quarantine treatments, quality-\noriented post harvest handling, and marketing chains.  \n \n12.  The Government\u2019s extension services and contracts with agribusiness exporters support \nexisting diversification activities; however, limited support services and marketing chain capacity \nconstrain the extent of diversification. Industry organizations could play a major role, but most \nare weak. The Sugar Cane Growers Council (SCGC) has strong institutional capacity, but other \nestablished industry organizations, e.g., the Ginger Council, are weak and ineffective. Emerging \nindustry organizations, including the Fruits and Vegetables Council and the Organic Farming \nAssociation, have limited capacity, but active participation by farmers, processors and traders \nwill improve the development of industry organizations and their ability to provide services. \nArrangements  with  partner  industry  organizations  in  the  region  are  possible  where  both \norganizations stand to benefit.4  \n_____________________________ \n1  ADB. 1995.

Off-Farm Livelihoods \n \n13.  The Government\u2019s Strategic Development Plan (SDP) 2003\u20132005 noted that formal \nemployment  in  2000  was  111,500,  and  that  the  formal  employment  sector  is  unable  to \naccommodate the roughly 17,000 new job seekers each year. Two reasons cited are (i) the \nweak investment situation following the serious political and social upheavals in recent years, \nwhich resulted in a lack of confidence by the private sector; and (ii) the limited human resource \nskills, which could be addressed by making more courses and training facilities available in the \nproject areas to remedy the lack of vocational training opportunities.  \n \n14.  Tourism  accounts  for  17%  of  GDP  and  employs  about  40,000  people  serving  an \nestimated 400,000 tourists in 2003. Overseas remittances from Fijians have been increasing \nsignificantly, and are soon likely to overtake sugar as the third highest foreign exchange earner, \nafter tourism and garment manufacturing. Events in 2000 affected tourism, but arrivals have \nnow  recovered  to  their  levels  before  the  coup.  This  recovery  is  expected  to  result  in  an \nexpansion and upgrading of Air Pacific\u2019s fleet, as well as of hotels and other tourism-related \nindustries. Manufacturing contributes 15% of GDP and employs about 28,000 people, many in \nthe clothing and footwear industry, which is dependent on preferential access to markets. \nRecently, Australia announced a 7-year phased restructuring of the garment industry, and Fiji \nIslands has to adjust to imminent loss of exports, and seek alternative livelihoods for displaced \ngarment workers. The SDP targets growth, particularly in food processing and wood-based \nindustries, with an emphasis on the development of infrastructure in the Western and Northern \ndivisions,  including  both  Labasa  and  Savusavu,  where  development  will  depend  on  the \nconstruction of the proposed Savusavu port for cost-effective access to markets, including by \nthe garment industry. Tourism and manufacturing will increase the demand for related services, \nincluding  small  businesses  and  microenterprises.  The  potential  exists  to  further  develop \nbusiness connections with Pacific rim countries, which would create a demand for internationally \ncertified training in on- and off- farm livelihood skills. \n \n    c.   The Rural Financial Sector \n \n15.  Rural households are largely denied access to basic financial services for savings and \ncredit. The formal financial market sector has increasingly focused on sugarcane farmers due to \nthe ability to deduct repayments from FSC payments for cane. The urban-based banking sector, \nwhich consists of the Government-owned Fiji Development Bank (FDB),5 six commercial banks, \nand three licensed credit institutions, has generally failed in rural areas, especially in remote \nareas in traditional, indigenous Fijian villages. These entities have turned away from agriculture \nlending, mainly because of small loan sizes, limited collateral, unsatisfactory repayment rates, \nand high transaction costs. This market failure constrains livelihood activities, and more than \nhalf the people surveyed cited lack of access to financial services as a principal constraint to \ndevelopment. The main issue in relation to the absence of rural financial services is the lack of \ncoverage by microfinance institutions (MFIs). \n \n16.  The Fiji Islands has 44 savings and credit unions (SCUs) with a total of 10,900 members \nand 9 savings clubs, all affiliated with the Fiji Savings and Credit Union League (FSCUL). The \n11 rural SCUs, which average 69 members each, include long-established groups within both \nIndo-Fijian and indigenous Fijian communities. The rural SCU in Volivoli has operated since \n1954, has 80 clan members, and has a current account balance with Westpac Bank of more \nthan US$5,000. The recently formed SCU in Korotasere, near Savusavu, has 65 members from \none clan and has accumulated more than US$3,000 in 2002.  \n \n_____________________________ \n5 Under its current license, FDB is allowed to provide credit for development but cannot accept deposits. \n  \n ", "6   \n17.  Some 104 thrift and credit cooperatives (TCCs) provide credit but not savings services. \nAt present, all TCCs\u2019 liabilities are in the form of member shares and they have little ability to \nbuild  up  savings.  Ninety-seven  TCCs  are  members  of  the  apex  body,  the  Canefarmers \nCooperative Savings and Loan Association (CCSLA), which on-lent CCSLA loans to some 560 \nTCC members in 2002. The usefulness of TCCs is now limited, because CCSLA can provide \nboth  credit  and  savings  services  directly  to  their  individual  members.  CCSLA  had  2,683 \nindividual members at the end of 2002, many of whom joined to access deposit services, and \nnonsugarcane farmers account for about half the savings accounts. In addition, the Sugar Cane \nGrowers Fund, which is neither a licensed financial institution nor an MFI, has a significant loan \nportfolio  that  could  be  used  to  support  sugarcane  farmers  in  diversification  and  livelihood \nactivities. The major issue facing the CCSLA and other cooperatives is the requirement that \n30% of annual surpluses be placed in the National Reserve Trust Fund. This has the adverse \neffect of reducing the ability of CCSLA and other cooperatives to retain earnings for asset \nexpansion.  \n \n18.  Currently, about 40% of rural loans come from informal sources that charge extremely \nhigh interest rates of 60\u2013100% per year. According to the findings of the project preparation \nsurvey, around 65% of rural households have the capacity to save about US$200 per year, and \nthe remaining 35% can save about US$30 per year. If the informal lending were financed by \nMFIs, the microfinance portfolio would increase to about US$20 million compared with US$7 \nmillion in 2001. In the case of sugar farms, the reason for limited lending is the lack of adequate \ncollateral resulting from the 30-year fixed term agricultural leases. By establishing new MFIs in \nrural areas, strengthening MFIs\u2019 capacity, and giving them access to wholesale borrowing \nfacilities  to  diversify  their  portfolios,  community-based  MFIs  will  help  increase  deposit \nmobilization and provide better access to financial services for the rural poor in a cost-effective \nmanner.  \n \n    d.  Rural Infrastructure \n \n19.  The SDP notes that rural villages have unequal access to basic infrastructure and \nservices. The development of opportunities in rural areas by tapping potential in all economic \nsectors depends on the availability of such infrastructure and services.6 Vanua Levu has much \npoorer infrastructure than Viti Levu. It has no international port for general container cargo and \nonly 11% of roads are paved and their maintenance is poor. As a result, land transport costs, \nincluding damage to produce transported, are high. This means that access to markets is \nexpensive, private sector investment and economic diversification are severely constrained, and \nout-migration is increasing. Poor aviation, electricity, telecommunications, and water supply \nfacilities also severely constrain development. Priority should be given to appropriate general \ncargo port and road development to permit cost-effective market access.7 \n \n    e.  Lessons Learned \n \n20.  Two projects prepared in the 1980s\u2014the Agriculture Diversification Programme and the \nSigatoka Valley Rural Development Project\u2014were completed in the early 1990s and evaluated \nin 1996 and 1997.8 Both were rated as partly successful. The reasons for this rating were similar \nfor both projects, namely: (i) the reliance placed on assumptions was excessive, and insufficient \nconsideration was given to such factors as road access, marketing, resource availability, and \nsocial  conditions;  (ii)  the  level  of  stakeholder  participation  was  inadequate,  leading  to \n_____________________________ \n \n6 Government of Fiji Islands. 2002.

Positive lessons learned include (i) the introduction of small-scale, on-farm technology \nthat  requires  limited  management  allowed  farm  intensification,  increased  crop  choices, \nimproved  the  quality  and  continuity  of  product  supply,  and  increased  incomes  and  farm \nemployment; (ii) the development of high\u2013value, smallholder agriculture that meets market, \nquality, and seasonal requirements by means of enhancing farmer groups and private sector \ncapacity has potential; and (iii) the private sector does respond to emerging rural business \nneeds. \n \n22.  Projects in other small island states have also led to the development of successful \nstrategies for agricultural diversification, including developing capacity for quality differentiation \nand for supplying seasonal niche markets.9 Lessons have also been drawn from programs and \ninstitutions in the region on the structure and function of industry organizations (e.g., the New \nZealand Fruitgrowers Federation, the Biological Farmers Australia Cooperative, the Meat and \nLivestock Council [Australia], the Landcare Association [Australia], and the Asia Pacific Seed \nAssociation), the management of competitive research and development funding (e.g., the Rural \nIndustries  Research  and  Development  Council,  Australia),  the  role  of  farm  business \nmanagement advisers (e.g., the Farm Management Society [Australia and New Zealand] and \nthe  Rural  Adjustment  Programme  [Australia]),  and  the  effectiveness  of  competency-based \ntraining (Industry Training Board Accreditation and Farm Cadet Scheme in Australia and New \nZealand). Efficient industry organizations have mitigated the risks of low diversification adoption \nrates in Southeast Asian countries.10 \n \n23.

For two decades, the EU's preferential prices have distorted Fiji Islands\u2019 resource use. \nAs a result, the agriculture sector suffers from a lack of diversification to other crops. Indications \nsuggest that Fiji Islands\u2019 sugar price will move to world market prices in the long term.15 To meet \nthe challenge, efficiency must improve, and resources must be reallocated to new uses with \nminimum  disruption.  The  Project  will  address  concerns  in  relation  to  the  reallocation  of \nresources to new uses in viable livelihoods. Project design is in accord with the Government\u2019s \nSDP (footnote 6). The Project seeks to alleviate poverty, primarily by providing income-earning \nopportunities, through close partnerships between the Government and the private sector. The \nSDP aims to create a social safety net for the poor, and the Project supports this objective. The \nSDP notes the great potential in rural areas, but recognizes the severe constraints resulting \nfrom inadequate market access, rural credit provision, and rural infrastructure and from poor \ndissemination  of  agricultural  knowledge,  particularly  in  relation  to  the  commercialization  of \nagriculture. The Project directly addresses each of these constraints. Its objectives are also \nconsistent with ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update 2005\u20132007 and are aligned with \nthe Millennium Development Goals. \n \n25.  In  the  past,  the  Government  and  external  funding  agencies  have  financed  several \nprojects and programs that directly target agriculture development; however, no major projects \nhave been implemented in the last 10 years except for some small bilateral assistance. To \ninsulate the country from internal and external shocks, Fiji Islands needs to diversify away from \nsugar. To date, lending to the agriculture sector has been inadequate, and the Government \nshould be helped with its agriculture restructuring initiatives to prepare farmers for the eventual \nremoval and/or reduction of the sugar price subsidy. Recently, in October 2004, the Indian \nGovernment  has  agreed  to  finance  about  US$40  million  for  the  sugar  mills  infrastructure \nupgrading. ADB coordinates closely with key development partners also involved in developing \nthe agriculture sector in Fiji Islands. These partners include Australia, the EU, India, New \nZealand, and United Nations agencies. Appendix 3 summarizes such external assistance. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Objectives \n \n26.  The proposed Project aims to offset the adverse effects of sugar industry restructuring \nand lease expiry and to create employment opportunities.16 The goal of the Project is to protect \nand improve the standard of living of rural people, which is at risk because of the restructuring of \nthe sugar sector. The project framework is in Appendix 4. \n \n27.  The purpose of the Project is to increase sustainable on- and off-farm livelihoods to at \nleast replace those lost during the course of sugar industry restructuring and to reduce rural \npoverty. To this end the Project seeks to (i) maintain a healthy agriculture sector with viable \nalternatives to sugarcane farming, (ii) generate sustainable off-farm work and self-employment \nopportunities for farmers exiting sugar and for other rural poor, (iii) provide access to savings \nand credit services in rural communities to facilitate livelihood activities and improve the quality \nof life, and (iv) provide critical farm access infrastructure for rural communities. \n \n28.  The Project covers the sugarcane belts and nearby rural and peri-urban areas of the \nWestern and Northern divisions on the main islands of Viti Levu and Vanua Levu, respectively. \n_____________________________ \n15 Eighth ACP Ministerial Conference, July 2003, Fiji Islands. \n16 ADB. 2000.

The Project includes poor people not involved in sugarcane \nfarming and will specifically address the needs of households rather than just of farmers, \nincluding the needs of women, in relation to on- and off-farm livelihood activities.  \n \n29.  The  Project\u2019s  target  groups  include  sugarcane  farmers,  cutters,  and  mill  workers; \nlandowners; and indigenous Fijians. It will help address the needs of continuing and incoming \nfarmers, exiting farmers whose leases are not renewed, and indigenous Fijians left out of the \neconomic mainstream. The target beneficiaries will be about 8,000 sugarcane farmers, as well \nas a significant number of other rural households. Rural communities will participate in the \ndesign and implementation of the field activities. A participatory approach will help develop trust \namong ethnic groups and is consistent with the Government\u2019s rural development policies and \nADB\u2019s poverty reduction strategies.  \n \n30.  The Project will comprise four components to be implemented in 6 years: (i) agricultural \ndiversification, (ii) off-farm livelihoods, (iii) rural financial services, and (iv) project coordination. \n \nB.  Components and Outputs \n \n1.  Agricultural Diversification \n \n31.  The  Project  will  establish  and  strengthen  related  industry  organizations,  strengthen \ncommercial  farming  capacity,  prioritize  adaptive  research,  and  support  private  extension \nservices to develop and adopt a strong commercialized agriculture sector.  \n \n    a.  Strengthening Industry Organizations and Market Access \n \n32.  To facilitate sustainable agriculture diversification led by the private sector, the formation \nand strengthening of industry organizations is crucial. Industry organizations are forums for \ndeveloping  policy  and  quality  standards,  networking,  disseminating  market  information  and \ntechnology, and providing negotiating strength. With the exception of the SCGC, both existing \nand emerging industry organizations have weak capacity. Some existing industry organizations, \nsuch as the Ginger Council, are mandated to collect levies, but provide insufficient services, \nwhile emerging industry organizations for fruits and vegetables, organic farming, and floriculture \nhave active interest groups but no funding arrangements. The Project will help strengthen at \nleast five existing and emerging industry organizations relevant to the Project by providing \nfunding for activities the industries consider to be of high priority. The Project will provide \nfunding for applied research, training, institutional development, and marketing proposals that \nmeet  specific  criteria,  objectives,  and  will  seek  about  25%  industry  contribution.  Industry \norganizations must be self-funding by the end of the Project. To improve adoption rates, the \nProject  will  support  early  access  to  skills  training,  strengthen  post  harvest  and  marketing \nactivities,  and  help  provide  better  quality  outreach  services  through  greater  private  sector \nparticipation. The proposed funding criteria are detailed in Appendix 5. \n \n33.  The Project will also support the strengthening of quarantine services to facilitate access \nto export markets through BQAs and access to imported seeds and planting materials while \nmaintaining bio security. The incursion of a new, foreign fruit fly would nullify existing BQAs, and \nthe high cost of developing new controls and new BQAs must be mitigated by strengthening bio \nsecurity.  The  Fiji  Islands  must  meet  WTO  quarantine  commitments  and  improve  linkages \nbetween the Fiji Quarantine Authority and the private sector. Quarantine inspection services will \nbe on a full cost-recovery basis, but until exports rise, anticipated revenues will not fully cover \ncosts. To strengthen quarantine services, the Project will provide funding (i) for a quarantine \nspecialist, (ii) for work attachments with the quarantine authorities of importing countries, and \n  \n ", "10  \n(iii) for office and laboratory equipment and utility vehicles for carrying out inspections. The main \noutputs  will  be  increased  sales  of  conventional  and  organic  foods,  awareness  of  market \nrequirements and export protocols, and secure access to improved planting materials and \nmarkets on the part of farmers. \n \n    b.  Strengthening Commercial Farming Capacity \n \n34.  To facilitate agriculture diversification, raising participants\u2019 competency in relation to \ncommercial agriculture is important. To this end, the Project will (i) strengthen the off-campus \nvocational training capacity of the Fiji College of Agriculture (FCA); (ii) develop the Ministry of \nAgriculture, Sugar, and Land Resettlement\u2019s (MASLR\u2019s) capacity for in-service staff training; (iii) \nestablish a farm business advisory service; and (iv) support two pilot market linkage activities in \nRakiraki and Seaqaqa. Accreditation of the courses will be conferred by an industry training \nboard  made  up  of  representatives  of  FCA,  industry  organizations,  and  the  Training  and \nProductivity  Authority  of  Fiji  (TPAF).  Good  potential  exists  for  commercial  partnering \narrangements with training providers outside the Fiji Islands to obtain competency standards \nand courses and within the Fiji Islands to deliver training. At project completion, by means of its \ncorporatization, the FCA will have viable revenue from training, and its training courses will be \naccredited. At least 500 farm business plans will be produced and farmers will have access to \nadvice  on  business  management.  The  Project  will  demonstrate  measures  to  support  farm \nenterprises,  post  harvest  handling,  and  marketing  from  remote  areas  and  disseminate \ninformation on prices, markets, buyers, and distributors. \n \n    c.  Developing and Transferring Technology \n \n35.  The Project will support priority, client-based, applied research and promote private \nextension services. Research proposals will be invited from public  and private institutions, \nincluding Government research centers, universities, and nongovernment organizations (NGOs) \nin the processes described in Appendix 5. The Project will also provide support to the Koronivia, \nSigatoka, Legalega, and Seaqaqa agricultural research stations to assist in field research. \nCurrently, private extension services are limited and will be introduced into the Project gradually. \nUntil private extension capacity is fully developed, MASLR\u2019s extension services will help support \nextension activities. NGOs will be recruited to help with extension activities and to facilitate the \nmobilization of farmer groups. Private service providers, including NGOs, will be selected in \nconsultation with steering committees. The project steering committees must approve research \nfunding and private extension intended for project funding based on specified criteria. The main \noutputs  include  at  least  eight  contractual  arrangements  with  private  service  providers, \nproduction  and  post  harvest  processing  of  crops  to  industry  specifications,  viable  model \norchards  and  farm  systems,  improved  research  and  extension  performance,  industry \norganization, and greater farm production and incomes. \n \n    d.  Rehabilitating Farm Access Roads \n \n36.  The Project will improve or rehabilitate about 600 kilometers of existing farm access \nroads to provide farming communities with access to markets. Farm to market roads will be \nidentified in a participatory process indicated in Appendix 5 whereby farmers contribute one-\nthird of maintenance costs to maintain such roads in good repair. Liaison with relevant agencies \nwill ensure complementarity with other on-going sugarcane farm access roads and rural road \nmaintenance and upgrading programs. \n \n    e.  Project Implementation Unit and Community Organization  \n \n37.  There is limited recent experience of major agriculture and rural development projects in \nFiji  Islands,  and  there  are  several  departments  within  MASLR  which  will  support \n  ", "    11\n \n \nimplementation.  To  facilitate  implementation  of  the  agricultural  diversification  component, \nproject implementation units (PIUs) will be established within MASLR's Department of Extension \nServices in Lautoka and Labasa to manage implementation and ensure effective coordination \nbetween MASLR departments. The field extension offices will coordinate activities at local \nlevels.  To  be  demand  driven,  participatory  processes  is  essential  to  inform  and  enable \nbeneficiaries to assess their needs and aspirations, and communicate with those implementing \nthe Project. National NGOs will be selected to lead project staff in assessing beneficiary needs. \n \n2.  Off-Farm Livelihoods \n     \na.  Development of Small and Micro-Enterprises  \n \n38.  The development of small businesses and micro-enterprises will promote employment in \nperi-urban and rural communities. By extending the outreach of the National Centre for Small \nand Micro Enterprise Development (NCSMED), the Project will promote income-generating \nactivities, such as handicrafts and small-scale agro-processing, in both farming and indigenous \nFijian communities. Beneficiaries will be provided with opportunities for training in the skills \nneeded for small businesses or employment. Particular attention will be given by the community \norganizing NGOs to participation by women and women's groups. The Project will also support \nsugar mill workers who may be laid off because of sugar industry restructuring. NCSMED will \nimplement  the  activity,  through  staff  located  in  the  six  project  field  offices  with  practical \nexperience  in  private  sector  business,  to  help  establish  about  1,200  small  and  micro-\nenterprises. \n \n    b.  Support for Vocational Training \n \n39.  To meet the target beneficiaries\u2019 need to acquire required skill levels for employment, \nthe Project will support the development of TPAF\u2019s vocational curriculum. A vocational training \nspecialist will help prepare business courses pertinent to self-employment in small businesses \nand micro-enterprises. The accreditation of TPAF vocational training courses will help ensure \nthe marketability of the qualifications.  \n \n40.  The Project will also support the improvement of TPAF\u2019s and the Sangam Institute\u2019s \nvocational training facilities in Lautoka and Labasa, respectively.17 In Lautoka, TPAF\u2019s existing \nbuilding will be refurbished to create workshops and three technical training rooms, and a new \nbuilding and facilities will be constructed to respond to training needs. In Labasa, the Sangam \nInstitute will establish additional training and accommodation facilities, largely for youths from \nremote areas. The Project and the Government will not fund any of the operational costs, \nbecause  both  organizations  operate  on  a  full  cost-recovery  basis.  Monitoring  reports  on \noperational activities will be part of the project monitoring system. The main project output will \nbe  the  establishment  of  additional  facilities  for  accredited  short-  and  long-term  vocational \ntraining. About 52 new and refurbished vocational training rooms and workshops will be in \noperation by the end of the project period. Courses will be offered on a full cost-recovery basis, \nwhich will place the emphasis on meeting the actual demands of target beneficiaries rather than \non the technical interests of the training institutions. Based on projected capacity and demand, \nthe institutions will train more than 1,000 people in vocational skills each year once courses \nhave been disseminated and the additional facilities are operational. \n_____________________________ \n17 In the SDP (footnote 6), the Government of the Fiji Islands stated that as its policy objective is \u201cto strengthen \npartnership with technical and vocational training establishments, the Government will provide grants support.\u201d \nTPAF and Sangam Institute have confirmed their participation and contributions to the Government in writing. \n  \n ", "12  \n3.  Rural Financial Services \n \n  a.  Institutional Strengthening of Microfinance Institutions \n \n41.  Proposals to strengthen MFIs have been based on a review of current conditions in the \ncontext of ADB\u2019s strategy.18 Specific lessons drawn from ADB\u2019s experience with microfinance \noperations  in  relation  to  establishing  an  enabling  policy  environment,  setting  up  financial \ninfrastructure,  and  developing  financial  intermediaries  to  achieve  financial  viability  and \nsustainability have been incorporated into the project design. The Project will strengthen MFIs\u2019 \nability  to  meet  beneficiaries\u2019  requirements.  SCUs  and  CCSLA  and  its  member  TCCs  are \ncommitted to providing appropriate retail financial services to poor rural communities. Unlike \ncommercial banks, MFIs will be community-based institutions that provide services more clearly \ntargeted to the needs of the poor. \n \n42.  The Project will focus on MFIs\u2019 financial systems by strengthening the apex institutions \nand their capacity to support their member institutions. The Project will strengthen and extend \nthe network of SCUs by supporting FSCUL as the apex institution responsible for establishing, \nsupervising, and monitoring SCUs. The expanded networks of SCUs will mobilize rural savings \nand increase the flow of funds to sustain on-going activities. The Project will support training, \nbusiness plans, improved governance and internal controls, upgraded systems, procedures and \ninformation technology, improved operating manuals, and promotion of new financial products. \nTwo  new  divisional  FSCUL  field  offices  will  receive  project  support  to  support  SCU \ndevelopment. Training will help strengthen FSCUL\u2019s management structures and individual \nSCUs.  \n \n43.  CCSLA is effectively the apex institution of the TCCs. The weakness of the TCCs in \ncomparison to the SCUs, is their lack of savings facilities. Thus they fail to meet the needs of \nbeneficiaries  and  are prevented  from  mobilizing  savings  to  support  rural  credit.  As  simple \ndistributors of CCSLA credit the TCCs, as currently constituted, have a limited role. The Project \nwill help strengthen TCCs\u2019 role. Two new CCSLA branches in Sigatoka and Rakiraki will receive \nproject support for their establishment and operating costs. CCSLA will also receive training \nsupport to strengthen its management and operational skills, and such training will include \nTCCs as appropriate. The Project will also facilitate improved resource use within the Sugar \nCane Growers Fund to support on- and off- farm livelihood development. \n \n    b.  Supporting Wholesale Credit Line \n \n44.  The  Fiji  Islands  has  adequate  liquidity,  but  the  use  of  credit  to  support  livelihood \ndevelopment in rural areas faces constraints. FSCUL and CCSLA will adopt proven MFI savings \nand credit models to mobilize rural savings to fund much of their new lending. However, this \nfaces the risk that MFIs\u2019 activities will be constrained if they have insufficient liquidity to promote \nlivelihood activities. This risk can be limited through the availability of wholesale funds. If the \nMFIs require such additional support, FDB has agreed to provide wholesale credit lines to \nFSCUL and CCSLA in a minimum amount of US$2 million and US$0.3 million equivalent, \nrespectively. FDB will make the wholesale funds available using its own funds for loans to \nCCSLA  and  FSCUL  at  a  2%  per  year  lending  margin  above  their  cost  of  funds.19  The \nperformance of the proposed MFIs was evaluated during project preparation, and the MFIs are \nrecognized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, including the Reserve Bank of Fiji and the \nDepartment of Cooperatives for CCSLA and the Ministry of Justice for FSCUL. The MFIs have \n_____________________________ \n18  ADB. 2000. Finance for the Poor: Microfinance Development Strategy. Manila. \n19  FDB has confirmed its interest in wholesaling loan funds to other MFIs in writing. The MFIs have also confirmed \ntheir interest in participating in the Project and have agreed to provide their contributions. \n  ", "    13\n \n \nmaintained a satisfactory operational history and are supported by adequate clientele and \nmanagement. \n \n45.  In  addition  to  providing  general  credit  for  individual  small  farmers  and  households, \nlivelihood development also needs to be supported through the maintenance of agricultural and \nrural lending to larger farmers and enterprises. FDB has agreed to increase its own agricultural \nand rural lending activities under existing credit programs for creditworthy borrowers. With the \nhelp of the farm business advisory service and NCSMED, the Project will seek to improve the \nsupply of bankable proposals for agricultural and rural enterprises. The Project will also help \nFDB strengthen its rural financial strategies and policies. \n \n4.  Project Coordination \n \n46.  The Project will involve a number of implementing agencies and lessons learned from \nprevious  projects  indicate  that  effective  coordination  will  be  essential  to  successful \nimplementation. The project coordination unit (PCU) in consultation with the divisional PIUs will \nsupport and coordinate activities of the implementing agencies in implementation planning, \nfinance, and monitoring. The PCU will also be the secretariat to the national steering committee \n(NSC), under which it will operate. The PCU will accommodate two international specialists \nproviding support to the whole project implementation: (i) the project implementation specialist \nwill support each implementing agency in planning and procedures for implementation; and (ii) \nthe project performance monitoring and evaluation (PPME) specialist will establish a PPME \nsystem covering the whole Project and support its use for reporting, particularly for the mid-term \nreview and project completion reports. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Responsiveness to the Changing Implementation Context \n \n47.  Post-project evaluations have noted excessive reliance on assumptions and insufficient \nfield data for project design. The processes proposed in the Project are less dependent on \nphysical  features  and  more  concerned  with  establishing  partnerships  with  stakeholders  for \nflexible implementation. The Project will mainly rely on the private sector for services, including \nextension, processing, and marketing. The project design includes a comprehensive market \nstudy  and  possible  cooperation  with  the  private  sector,  cooperatives,  farmer  groups,  and \nindividual farmers. During implementation, this cooperation will be a central feature of the \ndevelopment of industry organizations. The Project also defines a process and criteria for \nstakeholders to determine priorities and needs as implementation progresses. \n \n  2.  Beneficiaries\u2019 Needs \n \n48.  Earlier post-project evaluations concluded that inadequate stakeholder participation led \nto weakness in identifying beneficiaries\u2019 needs. The project design has involved extensive \ndiscussions  with  stakeholders,  including  the  Government,  the  private  sector,  NGOs,  and \nfarmers. Meetings were held with resettled farmers, squatters, and clan chiefs to ensure that the \nfull range of social and cultural groups was consulted. Findings were widely distributed and \nreported in the media, providing significant feedback. A series of eight stakeholder workshops \nwere conducted in Lautoka (four), Labasa (two), and Suva (two). More than 500 stakeholders \nattended  workshops  or  were  interviewed.  Beneficiaries  will  continue  to  be  involved  during \nimplementation  to  ensure  that  the  services  provided  are  demand  driven.  Participatory \nmonitoring and evaluation will be integrated into regular reporting to ensure that beneficiaries\u2019 \nconcerns and perceptions are incorporated into project implementation in a timely manner. \n  \n ", "14  \n   3.  Institutional Capacity for Implementation \n \n49.  Post-project  evaluations  have  noted  the  failure  of  project  design  to  recognize  and \naddress institutional weaknesses on the part of implementing agencies early on. The strength of \nthe  implementing  agencies  has  influenced  the  design  of  this  Project.  Several  established \nagencies with good track records have committed to participation with financial contributions, \nincluding TPAF and the Sangam Institute for vocational training, and CCSLA, FSCUL, and FDB \nfor rural finance. NCSMED is new and has yet to establish a track record, and the Project \nspecifically addresses its needs for institutional development in terms of skills and resources. \nThe Project recognizes the importance of the private sector for sustaining activities after project \ncompletion, and the project design has provided a significant role for the private sector in \nagricultural support services.  \n \nD.  Cost Estimates \n \n50.  The total project cost is estimated at US$49.8 million equivalent, inclusive of physical \nand price contingencies, interest during construction, commitment charges, taxes, and duties. \nThe project cost consists of a foreign exchange cost of US$10.7 million equivalent, or 21%, and \na local currency cost of US$39.1 million equivalent, or 79%. Table 2 summarizes the cost \nestimates and Appendix 6 presents details of the financing.  \n \nTable 2: Project Cost Summary \n(US$ \u2018000) \n \n   Local  Foreign   \nComponent  Currency  Exchange  Total Cost \nAgricultural Diversification  16,276  4,051  20,327 \nRural Finance  11,249  426  11,675 \nOff-Farm Livelihoods  6,639  1,593  8,232 \nProject Coordination  1,535  831  2,366 \n    Total Baseline Costs  35,699  6,650  42,349 \nPhysical Contingencies  2,299  573  2,871 \nPrice Contingencies  1,106  141  1,247 \n    Total Project Costs  39,104  7,364  46,468 \nInterest During Construction  0  2,755  2,755 \nCommitment Charges  0  305  305 \n    Total Costs to Be Financed  39,104  10,673  49,778 \nNote: Local currency costs include taxes and duties of US$4.7 million equivalent.  \nSource: Mission estimates. \n \nE.  Financing Plan \n \n51.  The Government requested a loan of US$25 million equivalent from ADB\u2019s ordinary \ncapital resources to help finance the Project. The loan will have a 25-year term, including a \ngrace period of 5 years; an interest rate to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London \ninterbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending facility; a commitment charge of 0.75% per year; \nand other terms and conditions as set out in the draft Loan Agreement. The Government has \nprovided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending \nfacility on the basis of these terms and conditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communications or advice \nfrom ADB. \n \n52.  ADB will finance a total of US$25 million equivalent, or 50.2% of the total project cost. \nADB financing will cover the foreign exchange cost of about US$10.7 million equivalent and a \nlocal currency cost of about US$14.3 million equivalent. The Government will contribute about \nUS$8.7 million equivalent or 17.5% of the total project cost, FDB will contribute about US$8.8 \nmillion equivalent or 17.7%, and the other beneficiaries will finance about US$7.3 million or \n  ", "    15\n \n \n14.6%.20 Table 3 summarizes financing plans and Appendix 6 provides details of the financing \nplan. \n \nTable 3: Financing Plan \n(US$ \u2018000) \n \n Source  Foreign Local  \nExchange Currency Total Cost  Percent\n Asian Development Bank  10,673 14,328 25,000  50.2\n Government of the Fiji Islands  0  8,690                8,690   a  17.5\n Fiji Development Bank  0  8,823 8,823  17.7\n Beneficiaries  0  7,262 7,262  14.6\n     Total   10,673 39,104 49,778  100.0\na Includes taxes and duties of US$4.7 million equivalent. \nSource: Mission estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Project Management \n \n53.  As  the  executing  agency,  MASLR  will  be  responsible  for  coordinating  the  overall \nimplementation  of  the  Project.  The  chief  executive  officer  of  MASLR  will  chair  an  NSC \ncomposed of representatives of the relevant national departments and implementing agencies \n(Ministry  of  Finance  and  National  Planning,  Department  of  Environment,  Public  Service \nCommission, Ministry of Commerce and Business Development, NCSMED, TPAF, FDB, private \nservice  providers)  and  relevant  civil  society  organizations.  The  NSC  will  oversee  project \nimplementation and provide policy guidance pertinent to the coordination of implementation. \nThe NSC will establish divisional steering committees in the western and northern divisions, \nwhich will be responsible for division-level coordination. The NSC will meet quarterly, and the \ndivisional steering committees will meet monthly (for the first year of the project and every other \nmonth thereafter), and together the committees will coordinate implementation and facilitate \nliaison between agencies. At field office level, a project implementation committee will meet \nmonthly to expedite project implementation. \n \n54.  A PCU will be established in Suva to support and coordinate activities and be the \nsecretariat to the NSC, under which it will operate. The PCU will be dedicated to the tasks of \ncoordinating  and  monitoring  the  implementing  agencies  and  supporting  their  planning  and \nfinancial  functions,  particularly  in  timely  and  accurate  preparation  of  documents  for \ndisbursements under the loan. With a single office in Suva, the effectiveness of the PCU \nrequires substantial funds for communication and travel to the project areas. The PCU will be \nled by a project coordinator. No separate person is proposed for a deputy project coordinator \nposition. One of the professional finance and monitoring staff will be selected as deputy, based \non  experience  and qualifications. High  caliber  staff  will be  recruited to  undertake  financial \nplanning and reporting, and PPME system will be developed project-wide. The PCU will be \nsupported by an international project implementation specialist, engaged for three years, funded \nby the loan; and an international PPME specialist making a series of short inputs over the \nproject period to establish a PPME system and support its use for regular reporting, particularly \nfor the mid-term review and project completion reports. \n \n55.  The agricultural diversification component will involve many units within MASLR and \nimplementation will require effective management and coordination. The western and northern \ndivisions' Department of Extension Services will establish a PIU and will work through the \n_____________________________ \n \n20  Other beneficiaries and their contributions are (i) farmers and the private sector, US$3.15 million; (ii) TPAF, \nUS$0.49 million; (iii) the Sangam Institute, US$1.08 million; (iv) FSCUL and SCUs, US$0.44 million; (v) CCSLA, \nUS$1.68 million; and (vi) the Fiji Sugar Corporation, US$0.42 million. \n  \n ", "16  \nextension offices throughout the project area. MASLR will re-orient existing posts to staff the \nPIUs with a project manager, deputy project manager/monitoring specialist and supporting staff \nwho will work exclusively for the Project. Other MASLR staff, particularly in field offices, will be \nresponsible for detailed implementation as part of their re-oriented job descriptions. The staff \ncosts will be funded by the Government within present budget provisions. PIUs consulting \nservices include support for the Young Farmer Training Study and market linkage pilot activities, \nas well as unspecified services that meet specialist needs identified during implementation. \nNational NGOs, with established record of implementing community-based projects in rural \nareas, as defined in Appendix 5, will be selected to lead project staff in assessing beneficiary \nneeds and aspirations. The NGOs will assign a full-time project manager to work with the PIUs \nto support implementation of the agricultural and other components. \n \n  2.   Implementation Period \n \n56.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  a  6-year  period.  Initial  activities  include  (i) \nestablishing  project  offices;  (ii)  recruiting  project  staff  and  consultants;  (iii)  holding  project \ninception seminars at the six field offices; (iv) establishing an imprest account; (v) procuring \nequipment and machinery, service vehicles, and preparation for civil works; and (vi) establishing \nthe project performance monitoring system. Potential private service providers will be identified \nearly on to commence privatized services wherever feasible. A more detailed implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n  3.  Procurement \n \n57.  Goods and services to be financed from the proceeds of the ADB loan will be procured \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. Equipment and machinery, materials, \nand  vehicles  valued  from  US$100,000  to  US$500,000  will  be  procured  by  means  of \ninternational  shopping,  and  contracts  exceeding  US$500,000  will  be  procured  following \ninternational competitive bidding procedures. Goods valued at less than US$100,000 may be \nprocured  using  direct  purchase.  Final  details  regarding  procurement  packages  will  be \ndetermined during implementation. The civil works proposed to be financed from the proceeds \nof  the  ADB  loan  will  be  procured  in  accordance  with  international  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  for  contracts  in  excess  of  US$1  million  and  with  local  competitive  bidding \nprocedures  for  contracts  worth  less  than  US$1  million  among  prequalified  contractors \nacceptable to ADB. Given the small and scattered nature of civil works to be constructed and/or \nrehabilitated under the Project, individual contracts are unlikely to attract international bidders. \nDomestic contractors have the capacity and capability to undertake the required contracts. An \nindicative procurement packages summary is in Appendix 8. \n \n  4.  Consulting Services \n \n58.  The Project will provide two key international specialists: (i) an implementation specialist \n(36 person-months), and (ii) a quarantine specialist (24 person-months). Advance action is \nproposed for recruitment for these two posts. Additional international and domestic consultants \nwill be engaged for a total of 73 person-months to support implementation during the early \nplanning phase and initial operations. The international experts (46 person-months) will consist \nof (i) a PPME specialist (12 person-months), (ii) a specialist in training young farmers (3 person-\nmonths),  (iii)  a  vocational  training  specialist  (4  person-months),  (iv)  an  MFI  specialist  (10 \nperson-months);  (v)  an  investment  specialist  (2  person-months),  and  (vi)  unallocated \nconsultants principally to support agricultural diversification (15 person-months). The domestic \nexperts (27 person-months) will include two post harvest and market linkage specialists and \nothers  as  required  during  implementation.  The  Project  will  also  recruit  NGOs  and  private \nextension service providers to help expedite implementation. Individual consultants and NGOs \nwill be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \n  ", "    17\n \n \nand  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  engagement  of  domestic  consultants. \nSelection criteria for NGOs are included in Appendix 5. The Government\u2019s attention will be \ncalled to ADB\u2019s recent anticorruption policy, particularly the section on fraud and corruption, as \nstated in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Details \nof specialists and their terms of reference are provided in Appendix 9.  \n \n  5.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n59.  All disbursements under the ADB loan will follow ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n(January 2001) and detailed arrangements agreed upon by the Government and ADB. To \nexpedite disbursements, the Government will channel part of the loan proceeds into an imprest \naccount with a ceiling of US$500,000 that could be revised depending on project performance. \nThe imprest account will be established at a bank acceptable to ADB immediately after loan \neffectiveness.  ADB\u2019s  statement  of  expenditures  procedure  will  be  followed  to  reimburse \nexpenditures  and  liquidate  imprest  account  expenses  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of \nUS$100,000. The Government\u2019s attention will be called to recent ADB\u2019s anti-money laundering \nand fighting terrorism policy.21 \n   \n6.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n60.  The PCU and MASLR will maintain separate records and accounts for the Project that, \ntogether with the related financial statements, imprest account, and statement of expenditures \nrecord, will be audited annually by independent private auditors acceptable to ADB. The finance \nofficers of the PCU will have experience in ADB\u2019s requirements for project accounting and \nauditing procedures. MASLR will provide ADB with copies of the Project\u2019s audited accounts and \nfinancial statements no later than six months after the end of the fiscal year to which they relate. \nThe PCU will also provide ADB with concise detailed monthly project performance reports, \nquarterly  progress  reports  and  comprehensive  annual  progress  reports  on  project \nimplementation within one month of the end of the reporting period that details physical and \nfinancial progress and summarize performance monitoring and evaluation results. Within 3 \nmonths of physical completion, the PCU will prepare a project completion report in standard \nADB format and submit it to ADB. \n \n  7.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n61.  Project performance monitoring and evaluation (PPME) will be undertaken for each \nproject component to ensure that project inputs are managed efficiently and that benefits are \nrealized. The PCU will have overall responsibility for PPME. Assisted by consultants, it will \ndesign, execute, and analyze baseline, midterm, and completion surveys, as well as any special \nstudies that may be required.22 PCU monitoring staff, assisted by consultants and working with \nmonitoring and field officers of each implementing agency, will monitor each activity. The PPME \nspecialist will help to (i) set up a computer-based, gender-disaggregated project performance \nmonitoring system in accordance with Government and ADB requirements; (ii) select a set of \nmonitorable development indicators; (iii) design the various surveys, including rapid results \ninitiatives;23 and (iv) organize workshops and on-the-job training for staff engaged in PPME \nwork, including implementing agencies.

ADB  will  carry  out  project  reviews  throughout  the  project  period  at  least  annually. \nReviews  will  address  both  the  effectiveness  of  the  implementation  arrangements  and  the \nProject\u2019s outputs and outcomes, and will propose adjustments where appropriate. During the \nthird year, ADB and the Government will carry out a comprehensive midterm review that will \nassess (i) the actual physical and financial progress; (ii) the performance of the implementation \narrangements, including that of the executing and implementing agencies, and the PIUs; (iii) the \nperformance  of  the  consultants  and  contractors;  (iv)  the  status  of  compliance  with  loan \ncovenants; and (v) the actual and potential outcomes of the Project in relation to its objectives. \nThe midterm review will provide a basis for ADB and the Government to identify and discuss \nany necessary changes in project design. \n \nIV.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \n63.  In conjunction with the Project, an advisory TA is proposed to support the strengthening \nof commercial agriculture development to ensure that appropriate policies, institutions, and \ncapacities are in place at project completion to sustain the performance of the private agriculture \nsector.  The  TA  will  strengthen  the  private  sector  so  that  it  can  take  the  leading  role  in \ndeveloping and promoting agribusiness. In addition to developing the policy and legislative \nenvironment, the TA will facilitate the development of self-sustaining industry organizations with \na medium- to long-term strategic and entrepreneurial vision that can raise funds, manage their \noperations, and provide effective services to the farming community. The TA will (i) help the \nindustry organizations apply funding criteria to activity proposals; (ii) assist in establishing the \noperations,  linkages,  and  strategic  focus  of  farm  business  advisory  services;  (iii)  assist  in \norienting  trade-  and  market-related  legislation,  information,  services,  protocols,  and \nrelationships; (iv) facilitate institutional linkages and networks between the Fijian agriculture \nsector, private and public organizations, and programs active in the region; (v) support training \nin agribusiness and agro-processing; and (vi) raise potential local entrepreneurs\u2019 and industry \norganizations\u2019 awareness of business opportunities. \n  \n64.  The total TA amount is US$875,000, of which ADB will finance US$600,000 on a grant \nbasis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan, and the Government \nwill provide the remainder in kind. Twenty person-months of international and about 7 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services are envisaged. The TA consultants will be engaged in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB with respect to the use of domestic consultants. Appendix 10 provides more \ndetails. \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, AND RISKS \n \n65.  Without the Project, the poverty situation will deteriorate significantly. The projected fall \nin the sugarcane price to F$40/t (US$20.5 equivalent) would give the typical 4 ha sugarcane \nfarm a gross margin of less than F$1,000 per year (US$500 equivalent) unless yields rise \n  ", "    19\n \n \nsignificantly.  At  this  level,  farmers  could  not  pay  wages  to  sugarcane  cutters  or  rents  to \nindigenous landowners. The result would be further acceleration in out-migration to urban and \nperi-urban squatter areas, thereby increasing the strain on social and physical infrastructure. \nFarm analyses show sufficient incentives for farmers to diversify in terms of increases in returns, \nlabor productivity, on-farm employment, and farm household cash income. The present gross \nmargin  for  a  representative  sugarcane  farm  is  F$2,070  per  year  (US$1,035  equivalent), \ncompared with a poverty threshold of F$6,500 (US$3,340 equivalent) per household per year, \nand as noted, without the Project, falling sugarcane prices will reduce this in the future to less \nthan F$1,000 per year (US$500 equivalent). Thus, without the Project, unless the price of sugar \nroughly triples, yields improve from 45 t/ha to more than 75 t/ha, production costs are reduced, \nor sugarcane farmers diversify their farms, most sugarcane farmers will continue to live below \nthe poverty line. Appendix 11 summarizes the poverty reduction and social strategy. \n \n66.  Diversified agriculture offers household incomes that are both well above the poverty \nlevel and substantially higher than current household incomes. Based on a variety of alternative \nagricultural products, the gross margin for a \"with project\" diversified farm is F$11,297 per year \n(US$5,650 equivalent), well above the poverty threshold, even if only 60% of the farm is used \nfor  diversified  agriculture  practices.  Diversified  farming  activities  are  expected  to  provide \nadditional employment in post harvest and processing activities equal to at least 25% of on-farm \nemployment. An adoption rate of 50% could fully replace the sugarcane employment lost with \nalternative  on-farm,  post  harvest  and  processing  employment  generated  by  agricultural \ndiversification. Off-farm livelihoods are expected to contribute to employment generation.  \n \n67.  Higher-value diversified agriculture will lead to changes in the nature of employment \ncompared with the current sugarcane-based situation. Jobs in diversified agriculture are less \nseasonal  in  nature  and  offer  significantly  more  employment  opportunities  for  women.  This \nprovides a greater degree of household stability. Experience in Fiji Islands has shown that \nmotivated  by  the  well-being  of  their  families,  women  will  take  advantage  of  rural  financial \nservices  and  micro-enterprise  opportunities  to  engage  in  off-farm  employment.  In  addition, \nproviding  decentralized  training  opportunities  will  contribute  to  household  and  community \nstability. \n \n68.  Benefits from the Project\u2019s agricultural diversification component are identified in terms \nof the expected increase in value added brought about by the project investment. Some of the \nrural financial services benefits are measurable in terms of increased agricultural output, but \nother rural financial services benefits and the off-farm livelihoods component are considered too \nspeculative for meaningful quantification, as the outcomes cannot be predicted accurately. \nBenefits  will  flow  beyond  the  project  area:  (i)  strengthening  NCSMED  will  enhance  the \ninstitution\u2019s capability throughout the Fiji Islands; (ii) improving access to and strengthening \nMFIs  will  benefit  households  outside  the  project  area,  thereby  enhancing  income-earning \nopportunities; (iii) strengthening quarantine services will provide access to international markets \nfor products grown throughout the Fiji Islands, and thus new income-earning opportunities; and \n(iv) enhancing extension and research will improve services, thereby increasing productivity and \nincomes. \n \n69.  Overall  project  costs  are  compared  with  the  projected  benefits  from  agricultural \ndiversification at an assumed 30% adoption rate, with provision for additional benefits from rural \nnon-agriculture  businesses  established  through  the  rural  financial  services  component.  No \nallowance is made for other benefits. The main quantified benefits are based on agricultural \ndiversification that exploits identified and readily available markets. However, adoption rates for \nindustry-targeted agricultural diversification programs implemented in other countries are known \nto vary (footnote 10). For example, during 1985\u20131995, adoption rates ranged from 36% for \nmixed horticulture in peninsular Malaysia to 70% for rubber in Sabah, Malaysia. Farmers in \n  \n ", "20  \nUdawalawe, Sri Lanka, faced with decreasing competitiveness in rice, diversified from 250 ha in \nother crops to more than 4,000 ha between 1986 and 1996. Factors affecting adoption rates in \nthese cases are similar to those in Fiji Islands and include (i) insufficient and diminishing returns \nfrom the traditional crop and way of farming; (ii) strength of farmer organizations, extension \nservices, and marketing networks; and (iii) access to rural microfinance. The most important \ndrivers of diversification adoption rates in Fiji Islands are expected to be the rate of decrease in \nsugar prices, the increase in sugarcane quality needed to compete without market protection, \nand  the  broad  dissemination  of  information  about  initial  successes.  If  the  adoption  of \ndiversification practices were 100%, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) would be 58%; \na 75% adoption rate gives an EIRR of 45%; and the base case adoption rate of 30% gives an \nEIRR of 19.1%. The EIRR falls below the 12% opportunity cost of capital, only when the \nadoption rate falls below 20%. These results suggest that returns are robust. The current trend \nindicates that farmers\u2019 incomes from sugar are inadequate, thus most farmers would need to \ndiversify, and an adoption rate above 30% is conservatively expected in the long run. Appendix \n12 presents detailed financial and economic analyses. \n \n70.  The adoption rates of diversified practices required for success are relatively modest, but \nthe Project does entail significant risks. These will be mitigated by the advisory TA, mainly by \nstrengthening the industry organizations. The Project\u2019s success also depends on sufficient land \nbeing available for diversified farming. Failure to implement a fair market valuation system will \nperpetuate the current system of illegal facilitative payments to landowners in an effort to \naddress the market distortions caused by the Agricultural Landlord and Tenant Act (Appendix \n2). The gross margins assumed are realistic, but their achievement depends on the attainment \nof quality standards that most farmers have not reached to date. The Project needs to oversee a \ntransformation  from  a  mentality  whereby  farmers  are  passively  dependent  on  a  single \nbuyer\u23afFSC\u23afto a business mindset favoring wider adoption of diversified crop production in a \nrelatively short period through private sector partnerships, focused extension services, and farm \nbusiness advisory services. Part of Fiji Island\u2019s comparative advantage is freedom from certain \npests.  Quarantine  risks,  especially  the  incursion  of  a  new,  exotic  fruit  fly,  would  see  the \ncessation of most fruits and vegetables exports for several years until effective control and \ndisinfestation treatments could be identified and demonstrated, and revised BQAs could be \nnegotiated for each affected product, a time-consuming and costly process. Market access for \nmany of the identified export products requires the negotiation of BQAs with the importing \ncountries. The willingness of importing countries to assign priority and resources to this process \nremains a risk. The strengthening of quarantine services is the Project\u2019s response directed at \nmitigating quarantine risks, and the Government has given assurances that all the necessary \nresources will be devoted to quarantine surveillance. The lack of financial services and credit to \nundertake income-generating and small off-farm livelihood activities under the Project pose a \nrisk  to  its  overall  success.  In  addition,  MASLR\u2019s  implementation  capability  needs  to  be \nenhanced,  and  the  Project  supports  such  strengthening.  Political  interference,  especially \npertaining to the allocation and use of resources, needs to be minimized if the Project is to \nsucceed in achieving its objectives. While there are substantial risks associated with the Project, \nadequate measures to minimize risks have been built into the Project. From the available \nevidence of the Project, benefits will outweigh the costs and the Project is sufficiently robust. \n \n71.  The risks are significant and the project activities seek to counter risks, such as on- and \noff-farm skill or credit deficiencies, as much as possible. The probable benefits are considered \nto outweigh the costs. The risks of social and economic disruption associated with dependence \non a single commodity crop\u23afsugar\u23afsold at distorted market prices are considered to be \ngreater.  An  initial  environmental  examination  was  undertaken,  and  the  Project  does  not \nanticipate major environmental risks. \n  \n  ", "    21\n \n \n \nVI.  ASSURANCES \n \nA.

RECOMMENDATION \n \n74.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of \nADB, and recommend that the Board approve the loan of US$25 million to the Fiji Islands for \nthe Alternative Livelihoods Development Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources with \ninterest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility; a term of 25 \nyears,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years;  and  such  other  terms  and  conditions  as  are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft Loan Agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n                    President \n1 March 2005 \n \n \n \n  ", "    Appendix 1  23\nRURAL SECTOR ANALYSIS \n \n1.  The Fiji Island\u2019s rural sector is dominated by agriculture, and within agriculture, by \nsugarcane and subsistence farming, which provided 36% and 35% respectively of agricultural \ngross domestic product in 2002. All other crops together were 15% of agricultural GDP, fisheries \n13%, livestock 5% and forestry 5%. However, these figures understate the importance of sugar \nfor Fiji Islands. Sugar contributes 60% of cash farm incomes, while other cash crops and off-\nfarm income contribute about 20% each. Subsistence farming, forestry, and livestock provide \nnon-cash or delayed benefits, but have traditionally provided farm households with a range of \nhousehold needs and resilience to political upheavals, tropical cyclones, and other shocks. \nSugarcane farms in the project area are small, averaging 4 hectares. The expiry of some 10,300 \nfarm leases over the next 25 years will result in experienced farmers leaving the sugar industry \nand the entry of landowners who may have limited capital and experience. Preferential prices \nhave distorted Fiji Islands\u2019 resource use with a bias toward sugar and allowed the industry, \nwhose performance was once world-class, to develop inefficient practices and standards. Over \nthe next few years, the European Union will reduce sugar prices to world price levels, requiring \na  restructuring  of  the  sugar  industry  most  probably  using  a  combination  of  improved \nperformance and reallocation of resources to other sectors. Recently, in October 2004, the \nIndian Government has agreed to finance about US$40 million for the Fiji Sugar Corporation's \nmill infrastructure upgrading. \n \n2.  The  Project  focuses  on  the  reallocation  of  resources  to  new  uses  in  viable  rural \nlivelihoods. Project design has been set in the context of Fiji Islands' Strategic Development \nPlan (SDP),1 which seeks to alleviate poverty by providing income-earning opportunities and \nbuilding capacity to enable the poor to take up such opportunities. The SDP also aims to create \na social safety net for those who cannot help themselves, and the Project indirectly supports this \nby seeking to minimize the number of people unable to help themselves. The SDP notes the \nlarge potential in rural areas, but recognizes the constraints, including poor access to markets; \nlow  availability  of  rural  credit;  inadequate  rural  infrastructure;  and  poor  dissemination  of \nagricultural  knowledge,  particularly  in  relation  to  the  commercialization  of  agriculture.  The \nProject will address these constraints. \n \nA.  Agriculture \n \n3.  While  some  farmers  will  continue to  have  to leave  or  enter  commercial  agriculture \nabruptly, others will make gradual changes, such as reducing their dependence on farming or \nrental incomes or increasing the scale, intensity, and diversity of their farm enterprises. Their \nability to do so with minimum disruption relies on enhanced access to markets for nonsugar \nagricultural  products  and  improved  farming  technologies,  off-farm  opportunities,  and  rural \nfinance. The Fiji Island\u2019s traditional commodity sectors, sugar and copra, are struggling, but \nhorticultural exports have performed better.  \n \n4.  Viable  scope  for  diversification  exists,  along  with  the  basic  capacity.  To  identify \nalternatives to sugar and copra, the Asian Development Bank undertook a comprehensive \nreview of the agriculture sector in 1995,2 and market prospects were revised during project \npreparation.3 Market opportunities for which a marketing structure is already in place include (i) \nexporting  to  the  Indo-Fijian,  Asian,  and  Pacific  island  communities  in  Australia  and  New \nZealand; (ii) enhancing traditional diversity in household self-sufficiency; and (iii) supplying the \n                                                 \n1  Government of the Fiji Islands. 2002.

", "24  Appendix 1 \nexpanding urban, agribusiness, and tourism markets. Fresh fruits, vegetables, taro, coconuts, \nspices, and other products are exported to regular buyers in Auckland, Sydney, Melbourne, and \nBrisbane.  Under  a  fruit  fly-host  bilateral  quarantine  agreement  (BQA),  475  metric  tons  of \npapaya, mango, eggplant, and breadfruit valued at US$510,000 were exported in 2001 to \nAuckland via the Nature\u2019s Way Export Treatment Cooperative in Nadi.4 Based on existing \ndemand, prices, and quality, scope exists to increase the volume, diversity, and duration of \nsupply to both domestic and export markets. Local agribusinesses are exploring options for \ntechnological and vertical integration to substitute local products for imported feed and food \ngrains, spices, and raw materials, thereby strengthening their control over supply and quality. \nThe incremental value from these markets is estimated at F$25 million per year (US$12.8 \nmillion equivalent). A number of other significant potential market opportunities are identified. \nExports from Fiji have been successful in Japan, the United States, and Europe over the past \ndecade, but have not kept up with demand or export quarantine requirements. Exploiting these \nopportunities requires increased supply, some promotion, and a sufficient marketing structure, \nand  for  some  products,  such  as  large-scale  pineapples  and  industrial  crops,  substantial \nagribusiness investment is required. \n \n5.  The quarantine services\u2019 weak capacity to develop and negotiate market access under \nBQAs, combined with limited extension capacity to help farmers seeking to comply with BQA \nrequirements, has constrained exports. While successful, Nadi\u2019s single facility for treating export \nproduce is operating below capacity. The use of post harvest handling equipment and practices \nat the farm level is limited, as are marketing skills. While the Fiji Islands does have a few \nestablished agribusinesses and emerging industry organizations, the nonsugar industries are \ngenerally fragmented. As a result, internal linkages within the sector, which could facilitate \nmarketing, information flow, and technology transfer, are inadequate. For example, domestic \ngrain  production  focuses  largely  on  regional  or  household  food  security,  while  domestic \nlivestock agribusinesses cannot obtain reliable local supplies of feed grains that meet basic \nspecifications, and therefore rely on imports.  \n \n6.  In more remote areas, such as Rakiraki and Vanua Levu, marketing networks are absent \nor weak, and physical access to markets is constrained and costly because of inadequate \ninfrastructure.  Poor  road  and  electricity  infrastructure  in  western  Vanua  Levu  has  limited \neconomic development and has been a critical factor in the demise of agribusiness projects \nthere in the past. Poor product handling practices and the absence of local cool-stores and \ngrading and packing facilities lead to severe quality deterioration during the passage from farm \nto market. Exporters and extension agents have worked with about ten pioneering small farm \nbusinesses to improve harvesting and handling, including by using stackable crates, basic \npacking sheds, and simple pre-coolers such as old refrigerated shipping containers.5 Once \nestablished, the owners of these facilities have become focal points for handling produce from \nother surrounding farmers, and managed commercially, the facilities provide benefits to all \nparties. Sustainability also requires improving business management skills and building up the \nsystems, marketing chains, service businesses, and relationships to support the transition. \nScaling up will require facilitating industry communication forums, promoting private sector \npartnering  relationships  between  businesses  and  industry  and  training  organizations,  and \ntraining  to  international  standards.  Appropriate  technology,  services  and  potential  business \npartners are accessible either within the Fiji Islands or in the region. Experience in the Fiji \nIslands and elsewhere is often of failure if the Government engages in trading, which is better \nleft to business and industry organizations that can play a crucial role in facilitation through \n                                                 \n4 TA No. 3887-FIJ Alternative Livelihoods Project: Mid Term Report.

Solving production and marketing constraints requires the Government to encourage \nindustry organizations to take the lead in industry development, improve product standards, and \nstrengthen organizations that provide services critical to agricultural exports and inputs. The \nQuarantine Authority must strengthen its focus on facilitating agricultural industry development \nthat allows some cost recovery, and not just focus on providing bio security as a strategy to \navoid costly incursions. Most of the existing industry organizations are weak. Only the Sugar \nCane  Growers  Council  is  long  established  and  has  strong  institutional  capacity,  including \ncompulsory levy legislation. Other established industry organizations with levy legislation, e.g., \nthe ginger, root crops, and coconut industry organizations, are weak and ineffective. Recently \nformed industry organizations, including the Fruits and Vegetables Council and the Organic \nFarming  Association,  have  little  capacity  as  yet,  but  do  have  strong  farmer  and  industry \nparticipation on a voluntary, commercial basis, which means that they can play an effective role \nin industry development and service provision, and also that they have good potential for self-\nfunding through voluntary membership fees and revenues from services, including providing \ntraining,  information,  marketing  support  (e.g.,  registered  brands,  promotions,  negotiation \nstrength),  and  selected  input  supplies  (e.g.,  packaging,  seeds,  pesticide).  Twinning \narrangements  with  partner  industry  organizations  in  the  region  are  possible  where  mutual \nbenefits exist. \n  \n8.  A key problem is the lack of a commercial ethic among farmers, a result of domination \nby a single, large sugar industry that is governed by a master award rather than by market \nforces. As a result, most of the smallholder farms have not been treated or operated as small \ncommercial enterprises. However, strong interest in diversification exists among stakeholders \nand successful examples exist in the project areas. The social survey that formed part of the \nproject preparatory technical assistance found that 21% of farms obtain cash income from \nnonsugar farm production, and that diversified farms and agribusinesses that generate at least \n50% of their cash income from specialized or mixed farming of nonsugar products include \nproducers  of  fruits  and  vegetables,  root  crops,  grains  and  pulses,  livestock,  agro  forestry, \nspices,  and  honey.  These  early  adopters  demonstrate  capacity  to  manage  relatively \nsophisticated  operations,  including  irrigation,  specialized  cultivation  and  export  treatments, \nquality-oriented post harvest and marketing chains, contract farming, and buyer relationships. \n  \n9.  Technology constraints can be addressed by equipment and practices that a small \nminority in the sector already use, and can also be adapted from designs and systems proven in \nsimilar  contexts  overseas.  Increasing  adoption  of  such  technologies  will,  however,  require \ntraining  to  acquire  new  skills,  some  adaptive  research,  and  focused  agricultural  extension \nsupport.  Farmers  have  adopted  diverse  technologies  and  skills  through  demonstrations, \nextension, exchanges between farmers, small-scale external training assistance, and industry \ngroup workshops. Tobacco and poultry agribusiness have also demonstrated the potential to \nimprove farmers\u2019 capacity through contract farming and in-house technical support. Fruit and \nvegetable exporters advise growers on harvesting, handling, and field measures to comply with \nexport BQAs and maintain cooling and packing facilities. \n \n10.   The  availability  of  training  in  practical,  commercial  farm  management  and  farming \ncompetencies is limited, although the Training and Productivity Authority of Fiji (TPAF) does \nprovide some training relevant to farm enterprises, such as business management, welding, and \nmechanics. The Fiji College of Agriculture (FCA) provides a three-year academic diploma in \ntropical agriculture funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Sugar and Land Resettlement to meet ", "26  Appendix 1 \nits ongoing staffing needs. The FCA could provide competency-based training in partnership \nwith local colleges by adapting course materials from training institutions registered with foreign \nnational agricultural industry training boards. \n \nB.  Off-Farm Livelihoods \n \n11.  The SDP 2003\u20132005 noted that formal employment in 2000 was recorded at 111,500 \nand that the formal sector is unable to accommodate about 17,000 new job seekers each year. \nTwo main reasons cited in the plan are the inadequacy of productive investment and the limited \nhuman  resource  skills.  Banks  and  investors  in  the  Fiji  Islands  suggest  that  finance  for \ninvestment in medium and large enterprises is not in short supply, but potential investors cite a \nlack of confidence. Although the Project cannot fully address the causes of low private sector \ninvestment, it can help people acquire new and improved skills to enter the formal workforce.  \n \n12.  The  informal  off-farm  sector,  which  is  so  prominent  and  is  often  dynamic  in  many \ncountries, is not yet well developed in Fiji. To enhance off-farm development, in 2002 the \nlegislature passed the Small and Micro Enterprises Development Act, under which the National \nCenter  for  Small  and  Micro  Enterprise  Development  (NCSMED)  was  established.  The \ninstitutional framework for small enterprise development has yet to be propagated, and existing \ncapacities in the NCSMED are limited. Urban and peri-urban areas have large numbers of \nnonagricultural small enterprises, but rural areas have only the occasional stores and micro \nenterprises, and most rural services are owned by urban proprietors. The Project will promote \nrural small enterprises for agricultural storage and cooling, input supply, and equipment. \n \n13.  The development of small businesses and micro-enterprises requires a leading sector to \ncreate a market. In the project areas, agriculture will act as such a leading sector. Some \nbeneficiaries, including farmers, agricultural laborers, and mill workers, have the capital and skill \nrequirements to set up small enterprises, and some have already done so. However, for more to \nbe  able  to  do  so  requires  technical  and  business  training,  orientation,  and  advice  about \navailable opportunities. While training providers, including the TPAF and the Fiji Institute of \nTechnology, tailor training courses to levy-paying larger enterprises, they also have the capacity \nto provide appropriate vocational and business management training relevant to the Project\u2019s \ntarget groups.  \n \nC.  Rural Financial Sector \n \n14.  Rural households, mainly nonsugarcane growers, are largely denied access to basic \nfinancial services, and even for sugarcane farmers, the formal finance sector has increasingly \nlimited its services to richer farmers. The urban-based banking sector has failed to serve rural \nareas in general, and has especially failed those in remoter areas in traditional, indigenous \nFijian villages. Even among sugarcane farmers, indigenous Fijian farmers are 60% more likely \nto  be  deprived  of  access  to  formal  banking  services.  This  market  failure  poses  a  major \nconstraint to livelihood activity based on agricultural diversification, off-farm livelihoods, or small \nand micro-enterprise development. More than half of Fijian farmers surveyed cited lack of \naccess to financial services\u2014credit and savings\u2014as a major constraint to development.  \n \n15.  The Fiji Islands is also facing the consequences of a Government policy of targeted \ncredits  and  grants  that  have  undermined  the  development  of  sustainable  rural  financial \ninstitutions. The widespread use of subsidized credits has reinforced a culture of financial \nindiscipline, contributing to poor repayment performance and preventing the development of \nrural  savings  and  credit  services  by  microfinance  institutions  (MFIs)  capable  of  providing \nefficient financial services to rural households. A major weakness of the Government programs \nis their emphasis on credit, as typified by the Fiji Development Bank offering only credit services ", "    Appendix 1  27\nwhile generally ignoring savings. As a result, most rural areas lack small savings and deposit \nfacilities. \n \n16.  Some MFIs do serve those sugarcane farmers who are richer and can repay through \ntheir sugarcane proceeds from the Fiji Sugar Corporation. Urban community groups are served \nby savings and credit unions. Much of the proposed agricultural diversification will take the form \nof sugarcane farmers developing and commercializing their farming systems. The Sugar Cane \nGrowers Fund and the Canefarmers Cooperative Savings and Loan Association (CCSLA) will \nsupport the Project by serving existing and incoming farmers. The Fiji Savings and Credit Union \nLeague and the CCSLA plan to extend their services to rural areas. \n \n17.  The  community-level  MFIs  have  demonstrated  that  they  can  provide  rural  financial \nservices in a cost-effective manner. As community-based entities, they are much better able to \nadapt to local community needs than commercial banks, and this is especially beneficial in \naddressing the social and cultural conditions in indigenous communities, which have previously \nbeen denied access to financial services and have not yet developed a culture of saving and \ntimely debt repayment. Such community-level institutions are needed to ensure that savings \nflow into sound investments and that the loans are repaid promptly. Their expansion depends \non the creation of and support for viable MFIs able to work in rural communities. Appropriate \ngovernment policy and strategy would include phasing out grant programs that interfere with the \ndevelopment  of  microfinance.  The  supervision  and  governance  of  MFIs  need  to  be \nstrengthened, and access to wholesale finance would leverage their deposit-taking ability and \nprofit retention. \n \nD.  Rural Infrastructure in Vanua Levu \n \n18.  The SDP notes that rural villages, rural settlements, and outlying islands still have \nunequal access to basic infrastructure and services. The development of opportunities in rural \nareas  by  tapping  potential  in  all  economic  sectors  (tourism,  agriculture,  forestry,  fisheries, \nmineral  resources,  and  manufacturing)  depends  on  the  availability  of  such  services  and \ninfrastructure. In relation to such infrastructure and services, Vanua Levu is an outer island by \ncomparison with the scale and quality of service provision in Viti Levu. The development needs \nof Vanua Levu have long been known and planned for, but funds have been used for better-off \nViti Levu, which has also received higher priority. \n \n19.  Past agricultural programs on Vanua Levu have had limited success because of a lack \nof market access opportunities. Development at Seaqaqa initially foresaw a farming system \nbased half on sugarcane and half on diversified crops, but ended up focusing predominantly on \nsugarcane because of the lack of market access. The Project will fail in Vanua Levu if efficient \nand effective market access and supporting infrastructure are not provided. \n \n  1.  Ports \n \n20.  Currently only bulk sugar, logs, and coconut oil are exported directly from Vanua Levu. \nWithout an international port for general container-based cargo to provide cost\u2013effective, direct \naccess to markets, private sector investment and export diversification will be constrained and \nhigh rates of inter-island migration will continue. Development of a new timber port at Bua in \nwestern Vanua Levu will be another specialized port un-served by general cargo vessels.  Most \ngoods must be transshipped through Suva or Lautoka, substantially increasing the costs of \nexports and imports, hindering investment, and increasing costs to consumers by 10% to 20% \nmore than in Viti Levu. International, general cargo ships already serve Savusavu to pipe \naboard oil from the copra mill, but they cannot load and unload general cargo due to the \nabsence of port facilities. A new port in Savusavu would benefit all of Vanua Levu and nearby ", "28  Appendix 1 \nislands such as Taveuni, Rabi, and Kioa as a general cargo port already served by international \nshipping, unlike any other location on the island. \n \n  2.  Other Infrastructure \n \n21.  At 1,690 kilometers, Vanua Levu has about half the length of roads of Viti Levu, but only \n188 kilometers (11%) are paved.6 The lack of paved roads, the high vehicle operating costs \n(including damage to transported produce, and the long travel times have contributed to the lack \nof development, thereby reducing opportunities and encouraging inter-island migration by both \nindigenous  Fijians  and  Indo-Fijians.  The  airports  at  Labasa  and  Savusavu  do  not  have \ninternational status, and current runway lengths and facilities limit domestic services to day-time \nflights by 10- to 17-seat aircraft, which is inadequate for significant tourism and excludes air \nfreight.  Domestic  services  urgently  need  to  be  improved  to  support  diversified  economic \ndevelopment.7  Labasa  does  have  electricity  generating  capacity,  but  the  Fiji  Electricity \nAuthority\u2019s grid serves only 25% of the island, concentrating on urban areas, but neglecting rural \nareas and villages. A reliable supply is needed for sustainable agro-processing and handling, as \nwell as for nonagricultural enterprises.8  \n \n22.  Almost half of Vanua Levu has no accessible telecommunications links, so even mobile \nphones  cannot  be  used.  Improved  communication  is  vital  for  market  access  and  for  the \nsustainability of commercial rural development.9 \n \n23.  Most rural communities on Vanua Levu do not have access to potable water or an efficient \nwater supply. Waterborne diseases are prevalent, and the health authorities have identified the \npresence of some potentially fatal diseases. \n                                                 \n6 ADB. 2002.

Status of Agricultural Lease Renewals \n \n1.  With the exception of Crown and freehold areas, land in the Fiji Islands is communally \nowned by Fijians as native land that cannot be bought or sold. The Native Lands Trust Board \n(NLTB) is a statutory body empowered to administer, develop, and manage native land for the \nbenefit of its Fijian owners. The NLTB identifies which areas are required for use by traditional \nFijian communities and makes the remainder of the land available for leasing. NLTB, not the \nactual landowners, issues the legally binding lease for agricultural, commercial, residential, and \nother uses. Leases of native land can only be issued by NLTB, so all farmers of native land are \ntenants whether they are Indo-Fijian or indigenous Fijian, including members of local clan, \nwhich owns the land, as well as Fijians from other areas of the Fiji Islands. No distinctions are \nmade on the basis of race or community membership, and the concept of owner-farmer does \nnot apply to any farmers of native land. \n \n2.  Laws to govern relations between landlords and agricultural tenants were enacted in \n1966 and became effective in 1967. The Agricultural Landlord and Tenant Act (ALTA) governs \nall agricultural leases of more than 2.5 acres, or about 1 hectare (ha), and cannot be amended \nunless  passed  by  two  thirds  of  the  members  of  both  the  lower  and  upper  houses.  The \nGovernment is currently debating whether ALTA should be supported in its present form, as it \nsees the legislation as too rigid. ALTA gives no right of automatic renewal of leases, and \ntenants can be required to vacate the land once the fixed lease and grace period expire. This \nhas created an impasse in which lease terms acceptable to all parties cannot be negotiated \nunder ALTA. \n \n3.  NLTB has proposed an alternative lease arrangement under the Native Land Trust Act. \nTable A2.1 summarizes the key differences between the current and proposed legislation. \n \nTable A2.1: Differences Between the Agricultural Landlord and Tenant Act and the \nProposed Native Land Trust Act \n \nAgricultural Landlord and Tenant Act  Native Land Trust Act \nLease Period \nA  minimum  30  years  to  a  maximum  of  99  years  is  A 50-year rolling lease is proposed with review after 25 \nallowed with no right of renewal, and the tenant must  years to consider extension for a further 25 years, thus \nvacate the land after a grace period in the event of  the tenant farmer is always given a minimum 25 years \nnonrenewal.

Political debate surrounds the issue of whether or not leases are renewed and whether \nthe  ensuing  terms  and  conditions  of  the  lease  are  fair  and  equitable.  Because  the  fixed \nschedule of lease rental rates under ALTA has not been updated since 1997, the rental rates \nare out of date.  In an effort to limit this distortion, NLTB has introduced a lump sum payment, \nthe new lease consideration, to induce landowners to lease out their land for an additional 30-\nyear period. However, the new lease consideration has been applied discriminately, being ", "30  Appendix 2 \napplicable to Indo-Fijian farmers but not to indigenous Fijians. The Asian Development Bank's \ninternational consultant has pointed out that if the new lease consideration is to be applied, it \nshould  be  applied  to  all  farmers  indiscriminately  and  without  reference  to  their  ethnic \nbackground. The practice of selectively applying the new lease consideration encouraged more \nindigenous Fijians to enter into farming, as without the inclusion of a new lease consideration \nthey can obtain leases on more favorable terms than Indo-Fijians. The banks lend to farmers to \nfinance the new lease consideration. \n \n4.  The first ALTA leases began to expire in 1997, 30 years after the legislation became \neffective (Table A2.2). In many cases, incoming indigenous Fijian farmers have commenced \nfarming. However, much land with expired leases remains unused, and NLTB\u2019s 2002 annual \nreport notes that this is partly due to disputes within the landowning groups.  \n \nTable A2.2: Expiry and Renewal of Agricultural Leases, 1997\u20132001 \n \nLeases to New \nNo. of \nRenewed to Sitting Tenants  Tenants/Landowner  Not Resolved \nYear  Expiring  \nCane  Other  Resi- Total  Cane  Other  Reside    \nLeases \nFarms  Farms  dential No.  Total % Farms  Farms  ntial  No.  % \n1997  94  36  9  6 51 54.3 34 30 17  2 2.1\n1998  204  44  9  7 60 29.4 111 56 54  11 5.4\n1999  1,541  345  86  56 487 31.6 496 138 241  322 20.9\n2000  1,940  317  30  25 372 19.2 473 105 115  735 37.9\n2001  442  142  51  1 194 43.9 17 12 14  193 43.7\n    Total  4,221  884  185  95 1,164 27.6 1,131 341 441  1,263 29.9\nSource: Native Land Trust Board.  \n \n5.  Of a total of 13,141 ALTA leases, the largest number of leases expired in 1999 and \n2000. In 2000, 1,940 leases expired but only 19% were renewed to sitting tenants. The large \nnumber  of  not  resolved  leases  can  be  attributed  to  uncertainties  about  renewals,  with \nlandowners reluctant to renew leases under ALTA when better terms could become available \nunder the Native Land Trust Act. The economic pressure on tenants and landlords to renew has \ncaused a substantial increase in the rate of renewal, and NLTB\u2019s 2002 annual report notes that \nthe clarification of legal uncertainties resulted in the renewal of some 400 expired leases in \nSeaqaqa.  The  rate  of  renewal  is  expected  to  increase,  although  a  continuing  level  of \nnonrenewals will occur to meet demand by members of the landowning communities to enter \ninto farming to improve their livelihoods. \n \n6.  During the 6-year project implementation period, some 2,800 ALTA leases will expire, \nbut most of the leases will probably be renewed as uncertainties are resolved and market forces \nencourage agreements. This trend is consistent with current political dialogue to resolve issues \nand Government policy:  \nFinding an amicable solution for land issues will facilitate purposeful development \nof land ...... Government realizes that as a \u201cfactor of production\u201d, land plays an \nimportant role in the production of goods and services that can be traded in a \nhighly  globalized  international  economy.

Strategic Development Plan 2003-2005. (Parliamentary Paper no. 72). ", "  Appendix 2  31 \nB.  Land Availability \n8.  The system of farming for the past 30 years has been based on farm areas of about 4 ha \nwith a modicum of mechanization. While high prices yielded good returns to farmers, they also \nallowed a change from family farming to widespread use of imported labor. Sugarcane cutting \ngangs are now mostly formed from outside the farming community, generally from traditional \nvillages and often from the outer islands. The Fijian sugar industry includes 17,000 sugarcane \ncutters, 13,000 from outside sugarcane farming, and under the off-farm and rural financial \nservices components of the Project many of these will lose seasonal sugar employment, but will \ngain from the more labor-intensive needs of diversified farming.  \n \n9.  In 1993, the sugarcane area peaked at just below 80,000 ha, but by 2001 this had fallen \nto 65,000 ha out of 96,000 ha registered. In the expansion phase up to 1993, some land was \nregistered  to  sugarcane  growers  on  steep  slopes  with  shallow  soils,  and  such  use  is \nenvironmentally unsound. Table A2.3 shows the distribution of registered sugarcane land in \nterms of topography. \n \nTable A2.3: Registered Sugarcane Land Topography  \n \nMill Area  Flat  Rolling  Steep  Very Steep  Total \nLautoka  Hectares  11,162 19,624 4,156 239  35,181\n  Percentage of Total   31.73 55.78 11.81 0.68  100\nRarawai   Hectares                    6,412 15,200 4,283 2,424  28,319\n  Percentage of Total  22.64 53.67 15.12 8.56  100\nPenang  Hectares  1,607 3,749 1,050 46  6,452\n  Percentage of Total  24.91 58.11 16.27 0.71  100\nLabasa   Hectares  13,359 19,583 7,385 3,743  44,070\n  Percentage of Total  30.31 44.44 16.76 8.49  100\nTotal Industry   Hectares  32,540 58,156 16,874 6,452  114,022\n  Percentage of Total  28.54 51 14.8 5.66  100\nSource:  Fiji Sugar Commission. \n \n10.  Most of the land, some 80%, is flat or rolling and is satisfactory for growing sugarcane \nand other arable crops. Current practices using bullocks, horses, and manual labor also allow \nsugarcane to be grown on steep and very steep slopes, and satisfactory yields are often \nobtained on this terrain. However, evidence indicates that soil conservation measures are not \nalways practiced, for example, with furrows running down the slopes. \n \n1.  Sugarcane Growing Potential \n \n11.  Some discussions of restructuring suggest that sugarcane yields will increase from 50 \nmetric tons/hectare (t/ha) to 55 t/ha and that the 64,000 ha under sugarcane would yield a sugar \nharvest of 3.5 million t. However, farms are unlikely to be able to survive on such low yields as \nsugarcane prices fall. Suitable flat and rolling land available within milling zones totals some \n90,000 ha, so even with modest yield improvements sufficient land appears to be available to \nmeet production requirements. Sugarcane yields have been relatively static at about 52 t/ha, but \nthe Sugarcane Research Centre reports much higher potential yields, as shown in Table A2.4. ", "32  Appendix 2 \nTable A2.4: Potential Sugarcane Yields \n \nSoil Type  Crop  Yield (t/ha)  Ave. P+3R \nGood deep soils normally found on flat land and  Plant  125   \neminently suitable for growing sugarcane  Ratoon    95  102.5 \nMedium soils normally found on flat and rolling  Plant    95   \nland and suitable for growing sugarcane.

The  potential  yield  of  land  suitable  for  sugarcane  is  92  t/ha  and Fiji  Islands could \nproduce 6.4 million t of sugarcane per year. These results are obtained in closely supervised \nagronomy trials and farmers cannot generally achieve such yields. Nevertheless, an average \nyield  in  excess  of  70  t/ha  should  be  achievable,  and  an  average  of  3,643  farmers  have \nexceeded this yield over the past 7 years. At this yield, 50,000 ha would satisfy projected mill \ndemand. \n \n2.  Sugarcane Price Projections \n \n13.   Land availability and potential yields suggest substantial scope for a continuing, viable \nsugarcane farming sector after restructuring to respond to changes in the European Union \nprices and the need to supply sugarcane competitively at world market prices. However, the \nprice structure after restructuring remains uncertain, with stakeholders unable to agree on \npricing. In this situation, estimates have been based on the range of low price projections made \nby millers. \n \n14.  The Fiji Sugar Corporation (FSC) has not made a single projection but a number of \nprojections at varying degrees of formality. An early proposal suggested a price of F$32/t \n(US$16.4/t) of sugarcane paid on delivery, but a number of other suggestions have been \nfloated. Projections presented to the Sugar Restructure Steering Committee combine a cash \nprice  with savings  on  lease  rental  and  transport,  while  other  projections  supplied  by  FSC \nindicate other prices. Table A2.5 gives the projected sugarcane price as presented to the \nRestructure Committee and FSC\u2019s latest estimates. \n \nTable A2.5: Projected Sugarcane Prices, 2003\u20132009  \n(F$/t) \nCategory   2003  2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009\nPrices Presented to Restructuring Committee  51.4 52.9 53.0 46.5 47.2 47.3 47.1\nFiji Sugar Corporation Price  51.3 41.5 49.0 43.8 42.5 39.8 37.4\nNote: Sugarcane prices include the costs of land rental and transport. \nSources: Ministry of Agriculture, Sugar, and Land Resettlement; Fiji Sugar Corporation. \n \n15.   The price paid for sugarcane will ultimately be determined by the price of sugar, so the \nprojected  sugarcane  prices  are  indicative  rather  than  definitive.  A  review  of  current  farm \noperations  suggests  that  marginal  farmers\u2019  income  starts  to  become  negative  at  F$45/t \n(US$23.1/t), and that some farms remain profitable at F$31.5/t (US$16.2/t), although at much \nlower net incomes. ", "  Appendix 2  33 \n  3.  Farmer Numbers and Production \n \n16.   The response to reductions in EU prices for sugar will include some farmers leaving the \nindustry either because returns are too low for their farms to be viable or because sugar ceases \nto be a viable use of farm resources, and some farmers may use good land to grow higher-\nvalue crops. The Project design assumes that farmers who remain in sugar and prosper will \nimprove yields to sustain viability. \n  \n17.   As  with  prices,  uncertainty  about  the  amount  of  sugarcane  required  by  millers  is \nconsiderable until restructuring has been agreed on. Once again, projections given to the \nRestructure Committee based on FSC data differ from other models being used by FSC. The \nformer calls for 3.4 million t by 2007, while the latter assumes 2.8 million t throughout. FSC \naccepts that the mills\u2019 capacity will be 3.6 million t after rehabilitation and does not explain how \nleaving 0.8 million t of capacity unutilized would produce either financial or economic benefits \nwhen all sugar is produced at world prices.  \n \n18.   This study uses the figures presented to the Restructure Committee and extends that \nprojection from 2007 to reach full capacity utilization in 2008. The projection in Table A2.6 also \nassumes an average yield of 72 t/ha, some 20 t/ha less than the Sugarcane Research Centre\u2019s \naverages on the same land types.  \n \nTable A2.6: Projections and Farmer Numbers, 2003\u20132008  \n \nCategory   2003  2004  2005  2006  2007 2008\nHectares Harvested (\u2018000)  64,000 61,500 59,500 56,000 53,000 50,000\nYield (t/ha)  43.8 47.2 53.8 60.7 64.2 72.0\nTotal Tons of Cane (\u2018000)  2,800 2,900 3,200 3,400 3,400 3,600\nOverall Time Efficiency (%)  73.0 75.0 75.0 75.0 82.5 84.0\nOverall Recovery (%)  81.0 81.0 85.0 85.0 85.0 85.0\nTC/TS (t cane/t sugar)   9.58 8.67 8.69 8.22 8.0 2 8.15\nTotal Tons of Sugar 94NT (\u2018000)   293.2 303.7 371.7 394.9 394.9 441.7\nTotal Number of Farms  21,371\nTotal Number of Productive Farms  17,297 16,622 15,658 14,000 13,250 12,500\nAverage Farm Size (ha)  3.7 3.7 3.8 4.0 4.0 4.0\nNumber of Farmers Exiting  4,074 676 964 1,658 750 750\nha = hectare, t/ha = metric tons/hectare. \nNote: 4,074 non-productive farms, in the 21,371 total registered in 2003, are excluded from the projections \nSource: Project preparatory technical assistance estimates. \n   \n19.   In this projection, to meet the mill requirement of 3.6 million t of sugarcane by 2008 at \nyields of 72 t/ha, 12,500 farmers would be required with an average harvest area of 4 ha per \nfarm. This means that an estimated 4,798 farmers would exit sugarcane farming activities. \n \n20. The numbers are indicative at this stage and are considered as a worst case scenario. The \nreduction in harvested area is dictated by decisions on the capacity of the mills, reflecting a mill-\nconstrained scenario, and is not in response to either the availability or productivity of land. \nAlternative scenarios are possible by projecting investments in increased mill capacity to better \nmatch land availability and potential yields. Given that either scenario requires viability at world \nmarket prices, no credible sugar market volume constraint exists. \n ", "34  Appendix 3 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FIJIAN AGRICULTURE SECTOR \n \nAmount (US$ \nFunding    million)  Year   \nSource  Project Title  Grant        Loan  Approved  Activities \n           \nADB  Sigatoka Valley  0  4.4  1986  Rural infrastructure, agribusiness, \nDevelopment Project  and agricultural support services \n           \n  Agricultural Development  0  20.0  1986  Sector restructuring, policy reform, \nProject  and institutional development \n           \nAusAID  Beef Farming  10.0  0  1978  Small beef farm development \n           \n  Rice Development  5.0  0  1985  Irrigated rice development \n           \n  Soil and Crop Evaluation  2.0  0  1980  Research development support \nProject \n           \nEuropean  Micro Pineapple  1.2  0  1992  Small farmers pineapple \nUnion  Development Project  development for export  \n           \nFAO  Small-Scale Dairy Unit  4.0  0  2003  Small dairy farm development \nDevelopment \n           \n  Telefood Programme  0.1  0  2003  Strengthening of the subsistence \nfarming sector \n           \nNZAID  Beef Farming  5.0  0  1978  Group/community-based beef \nDevelopment  farming support \n           \nADB = Asian Development Bank, AusAID = Australian Agency for International Development, FAO = Food and \nAgriculture Organization, NZAID = New Zealand Agency for International Development. \nSource: ADB estimates. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  35\nPROJECT FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign    Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal       \n     \nProtect and improve the  \u2022  At completion, rural families  \u2022  Household statistics \nstandard of living of rural  currently deriving livelihoods from  \u2022  Economic reports \npeople at risk because of   sugar sector activities at least  \u2022  PPMS \nsugar sector restructuring  maintain their total real incomes  \u2022  PCR and PPAR \nPurpose       \n      Assumption: \nIncrease sustainable  \u2022  Agriculture continues to account   \u2022  Agricultural statistics  \u2022  No major social or \nlivelihoods, on- and off-  at least 15% of GDP  \u2022  Employment  economic crisis limits \nfarm, to at least replace  \u2022  By 2010, nonsugar cash crops  statistics  the time available to \nthose lost during the  increase from 15% to 25% of  \u2022  Annual NCSMED  develop alternative \ncourse of sugar sector  agricultural GDP  survey of SMEs  livelihoods \nrestructuring  \u2022  At least 50% of farmers obtain at  \u2022  PPMS   \nleast 50% of farm incomes from  \u2022  PCR  Risk: \nnonsugar crops and livestock  \u2022  Restructuring results \n\u2022  By 2010, 4,000 new off-farm jobs   in a still substantial, \nhave been created in existing  viable sugar industry \nenterprises \n\u2022  By 2010, 1,200 new small and \nmicro enterprises have been \nestablished \nOutputs       \n       \n1.

", "  Appendix 10  51 \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO STRENGTHEN  \nCOMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE DEVELOPMENT \nA.  Justification \n1.  The  Fiji  Islands\u2019  agriculture  sector  is  highly  polarized  between  a  small  number  of \nagribusinesses and a large number of small farmers who have limited commercial experience. \nMost investment is in projects with short-term capital recovery, such as in tourism, timber \nextraction, and garment making, whereas under normal conditions agribusinesses require a \nminimum of 5 years for investment recovery. The country\u2019s political instability, the land tenure \nsituation, and the sugar industry\u2019s dominance without quality incentives have contributed to the \nlimited  development  of  commercial  agriculture,  private  sector  support  services,  and \nagribusiness investment. \n \n2.  Business models relevant to the agriculture sector include joint ventures between large \ncorporations and indigenous clan (mataqali) landowners (e.g., in forestry and mining), contract \nfarming  between  agribusiness  and  farmers  (e.g.,  the  tobacco  and  sugar  industries),  and \nindividual farm enterprises managing marketing. Agribusiness and marketing development are \ncritical  for  commercial  development.  Strengthening  marketing  chains  and  marketing \nperformance  both  in  sugarcane  areas  and  beyond,  including  the  outer  islands,  requires \nimproving  agribusiness  skills  and  capacity  to  promote  profitable  enterprises  in  the  sector. \nPrivate sector support services are critical to achieving this objective.  \n  \n3.  The development of commercial agriculture, including agribusinesses, farm enterprises, \nand marketing and other commercial agricultural services, is constrained by (i) the shortage of \nspecific technical skills; (ii) the limited commercial knowledge and the difficulties of enforcing \ncontracts; (iii) the shortage and unreliability of local raw material supplies and the resultant \ndependence on imports; (iv) the limited capacity to supply high-quality exports and to cater to \ndomestic  tourist  markets;  (vi)  the  lack  of  production,  trade,  management,  and  marketing \nexperience; (vi) the limited local processing facilities; (vii) the weakness of commercial networks \nthroughout the country; (viii) the inadequacies of policy and legislation; and (ix) the absence of \npolicy and fiscal instruments to stimulate investment in the sector, especially in private research \nand development, and in advisory information services.    \n \n4.  The  project  preparatory  technical  assistance  (TA)  field  findings  and  the  workshop \ndiscussions with stakeholders identified a number of areas of agribusiness for development. \nThose with potential include small and medium feed processing and drying facilities, livestock \nfinishing feedlots, year-round supply and marketing of pineapples, aquaculture hatcheries and \noutgrowing facilities, neem organic pesticide and textile manufacture, Stevia artificial sweetener \nproduction, and joint ventures in smallholder eucalyptus  agro forestry. Investment opportunities \nin services include small and medium post harvest grading, packing, and cool-storage linked to \ncollection and distribution facilities; contract machinery services, especially for harvesting field \ncrops; product development and marketing services (e.g., based on indigenous fruit, nuts, \nnutraceuticals,  oils,  essences,  and  spices);  and  advisory  information  services.  The  major \nconstraint cited in most cases is not lack of access to capital, but limited human and institutional \ncapacity. The TA would facilitate the development of proposed agribusiness opportunities and \ncapacity. \n \n5.  State-owned agribusinesses have failed to sustain or stimulate the sector because of \nlimited accountability, lack of performance-based management, and limited sophistication of \ncommercial  practices.  The  Government  has  an  important  role  in  facilitating  and  providing \nservices to the private sector. The TA would provide assistance to identify potential policy \noptions, structures, and processes to improve private sector performance. In terms of services, ", "52  Appendix 10 \nthe Ministry of Agriculture, Sugar and Land Resettlement (MASLR) divisions and agencies \nresponsible for commerce, market information, import and export regulation, research, and \nextension services do not have forums and processes whereby the needs and priorities of the \nprivate  agriculture  sector  are  periodically  identified  and  addressed.  To  stimulate  both  the \ndemand for and the supply of services, industry organizations must have a role in setting \npriorities and contributing to their achievement. The TA would help to institutionalize interaction \nwith industry advisory forums to support the development of private agricultural services. \n \nB.  Scope \n6.  The  TA  would  strengthen  commercial  agriculture  development  by  (i)  supporting \nagribusinesses, industry organizations, farmer groups, and farm landowners; (ii) helping to \nstrengthen  the  capacity,  linkages,  strategy,  and  commercial  operations  of  farm  business \nadvisory services; (iii) assisting the Government, industry organizations, and agribusinesses to \nimplement their strategic goals of becoming performance-oriented, customer-focused entities; \n(iv) facilitating marketing development by helping to orient trade- and market-related legislation, \ninformation,  services,  protocols,  standards,  and  commercial  relationships;  (v)  facilitating \ninstitutional linkages and the formation of commercial networks between the Fijian agriculture \nsector and agricultural industries, organizations, and programs active in the region and target \nmarkets;  (vi)  supporting  training  in  agribusiness  and  agro-processing;  and  (vii)  raising \nawareness of regional business opportunities for local entrepreneurs and industry organizations. \n \n7.  In conjunction with the loan, the TA will provide advisory assistance to the private sector \nfor developing agribusiness opportunities through studies, workshops, and training; identifying \nappropriate technologies and quality systems; and developing linkages with markets. Support \nfrom the TA will include facilitating agribusiness study tours and trade missions. The TA will \nfacilitate institutionalizing interaction between and among industry organizations and MASLR\u2019s \nresearch and advisory information services to ensure that the private sector takes a leading role \nin prioritizing objectives for support services and can help achieve those objectives. Policy \npapers and programming studies would be prepared to help the Government review trade- and \nmarket-related legislative obstacles and identify appropriate policy instruments and fiscal tools \n(e.g., tax incentives for research and development) to stimulate the development of commercial \nagriculture  and  support  services.  Advisory  assistance  would  be  provided  to  MASLR  to \ncorporatize  the  Fiji  College  of  Agriculture  (FCA),  develop  accreditation  for  farm  business \nadvisers,  and  develop  fee-for-service  packages  that  could  be  transferred  to  private  sector \nproviders.  \n \n8.  The TA would also strengthen and expand commercial information services for farmers \nand  agribusinesses.  This  would  involve  support  to  MASLR,  agribusinesses,  industry \norganizations, and other agencies to develop media for providing relevant information to farmers \nand  agribusinesses.  Content  will  include  information  about  products  and  markets,  farm \nmanagement issues, production and post harvest techniques, industry activities and events, \nresearch and extension activities and reports, sources of expertise and contractors, and other \ninstitutional  sources  of  information.  The  TA  would  help  develop  web  sites,  online  access \ncenters,  newsletters,  radio  programs,  visual  media,  and  mobile  information  units.  The  TA \nFramework is given in Table A10.1. \n \nC.  Estimated Costs and Financing \n9.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at US$875,000 equivalent, of which US$423,000 is \nthe foreign exchange cost and US$452,000 is the local currency cost. The Government has \nasked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to provide $600,000 on a grant basis from Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan to finance the total foreign exchange cost ", "  Appendix 10  53 \n \n \nand US$177,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The Government will finance the balance \nof the local currency cost, equivalent to US$275,000, by providing office accommodation and \ncounterpart agency staff as appropriate. Detailed costs are given in Table A10.2. MASLR will be \nthe executing agency for the TA. The national steering committee and the divisional steering \ncommittees will review the progress of the TA and will provide the necessary guidance. The TA \nwill be implemented over a period of 24 months. It envisages that an estimated total of 20 \nperson-months of international and 7 person-months of domestic consulting services will be \nrequired. This will cover an international agribusiness and agricultural institutions consultant for \n10 person-months, and for unspecified support, 10 person-months of international consulting, \nand 7 person-months of domestic consulting (e.g., trade legislation, media, marketing, and \nagribusiness research/development). Terms of reference for these specialized areas will be \ndrafted during project implementation. Individual consultants will be selected according to ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n \n10.  Procurement of equipment and supplies will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement. During the implementation period, the consultants will submit an inception report, \nregular monthly updates, a draft final report at least one month prior to completion, and a final \nreport  upon  completion  that  incorporates  the  comments  provided  by  both  ADB  and  the \nGovernment. The TA is expected to commence in April 2005 and is expected to be completed \nby March 2007. \n \nD.  Terms of Reference for the International Consultant \n11.  The agribusiness and agricultural institutions specialist (10 person-months) will: \n  \n(i)  help the project coordination unit strengthen agriculture sector organizations and \nMASLR to ensure participation by and representation of agribusinesses, farmers, \nand other key stakeholders in structures and processes;  \n(ii)  facilitate  the  development  of  industry  commodity  and  food  handling  quality \nstandards, certification, and trade legislation to international levels, including for \norganic  products,  in  collaboration  with  industry  councils,  exporters,  and \nquarantine experts;  \n(iii)  advise the private sector on the development of agribusiness opportunities by \nmeans  of  studies,  workshops,  and  training  and  by  identifying  appropriate \ntechnologies and quality systems;  \n(iv)  facilitate domestic and international market linkages by arranging technical study \ntours, trade missions, and trade fairs;  \n(v)  assist industry and the Government to identify potential policy options, structures, \nand  processes  to  stimulate  and  sustain  the  development  of  commercial \nagriculture;

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national policy in   Sector identified as a national priority in  \ncountry poverty analysis?  Yes.  country poverty partnership agreement? Yes. \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in the Fiji Islands: \n \nMore than half the people live in rural areas and agriculture is the mainstay of the economy in terms of \nproduction value, employment and income generation, and subsistence. Some 76,555 (56%) households, or \nabout 385,000 people, live in rural areas. Within the five sugarcane belt provinces of Ba, Nadroga, Ra, Macuata, \nand Cakaudrove, an estimated 90,000 Indo-Fijian family members rely in whole or in part on sugarcane farming \nand/or sugarcane cutting for their household incomes. In addition, some 104,000 indigenous Fijian family \nmembers rely on sugarcane farming in whole or in part for their communal rental income, with perhaps 13,500 \nworking as seasonal sugarcane cutters and an increasing number engaging in farming as incoming tenants. In \ntotal, about 300,000 people depend directly or indirectly on agriculture, especially on activities related to \nsugarcane farming. Current estimates indicate that more than 50% of the people in the Northern and Western \ndivisions subsist below the household poverty threshold of F$6,500/year (US$3,340 equivalent). A recent \npoverty assessment of hardship by the Asian Development Bank indicated that 35% to 40% of the population is \nlikely to have incomes below the poverty line. \n \nReductions in EU preferential prices for sugar will substantially reduce sugarcane prices and incomes for \ncontinuing and incoming farmers, sugarcane cutters, and landowners. Their poverty will increase without \ndiversification of the rural economy away from sugar to higher-value crops and off-farm employment, both to \nsupport farm family incomes and to provide alternative incomes for exiting farmers unable to find new leasehold \nfarms. The agricultural diversification and off-farm livelihood components directly address these needs, while the \nrural financial services activity allows communities on- and off-farm, as well as in traditional villages, to manage \ntheir financial resources to support livelihood activities. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis      Targeting Classification: Targeted intervention \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed? \n \nThe latest official poverty analysis for Fiji Islands was undertaken by UNDP and published in 1997. The analysis \nwas based on the 1990/91 HIES. New HIES were undertaken by the Fiji Bureau of Statistics for the urban \ncenters in 2002/03 and the rural areas in 2003/04. The data from these two household surveys is now being \nanalyzed by the Government with assistance from ADB. Revised estimates of urban poverty have been \ncomplied and are now being reviewed by the Government, whereas estimates of rural poverty are expected to \nbe completed by mid-2005. In 2003, a participatory assessment of hardship was undertaken by means of \nconsultative workshops and focus-group discussions with around twenty communities spread throughout the \ncountry. These consultations included communities from all ethnic backgrounds in both urban and rural areas, \nand involved women, church and youth groups, as well as traditional leaders and nongovernment organizations. \nThese participatory assessments provided qualitative information on the people's perceptions of the causes and \ncharacteristics of poverty and hardship in there respective situations, as well as their needs and priorities for \npoverty alleviation interventions.  \n \nC.   Participation Process \nThe  consultative  process  covered  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders,  including  central  government  and local \ngovernment staff; international agencies; nongovernment organization (NGO) staff; state-owned enterprise and \nparastatal staff; and private sector individuals, including farmers, clan landowners, traditional leaders, small \nbusiness operators, and displaced tenants. The process of consultation with stakeholders will be important \nduring implementation, and community-organizing NGOs will help ensure high beneficiary participation in project \nimplementation. Stakeholders will be represented on the national and divisional steering committees. \n \nD.   Gender and Development \nGender issues have been integrated with the project design. Women have generally played little part in \ntraditional sugarcane farming, but will play an increased role in diversified agriculture, including in such areas as \nhorticulture, floriculture, and small livestock; in the development of a business approach to farming; and in the \ndevelopment of off-farm livelihoods, including handicrafts, small-scale processing, and micro-enterprises. The \ncommunity-organizing NGOs, which will include a substantial percentage of women organizers, will seek to \nensure effective participation by women in project activities. Vocational training will involve women in training \ncourses  and  include  course  specifically  targeting  women\u2019s  income-generating  skills.  Community-based \nmicrofinance institutions will also seek to include women in savings and credit activities. \n ", "  Appendix 11  57 \n \n \n \nE.

Quantification of Benefits \n \n1.  A  significant  proportion  of  the  benefits  arising  from  the  agricultural  diversification \ncomponent are directly quantifiable in terms of the increase in value added expected to result \nfrom the investment. A proportion of the benefits derived from the rural financial services (RFS) \ncomponent can be measured in terms of increased agricultural output. However, other benefits \nof this component and the off-farm livelihoods (OFL) component are considered too speculative \nfor  meaningful  quantification,  as  the  outcomes  cannot  be  predicted  with  accuracy.  The \nstrengthening of the National Center for Small and Micro Enterprise Development (NCSMED) to \nmeet the requirements of the Project will enhance this fledgling institution\u2019s capability to serve \nthe small and micro-enterprise sector throughout Fiji Islands. Households in and outside the \nproject area will benefit from a stronger microfinance institutional structure that better meets \ntheir  financial  service  needs.  The  strengthening  of  the  quarantine  services,  vital  for  the \nagricultural  diversification  of  the  sugarcane  growing  areas,  will  provide  market  access  for \nproducts grown throughout Fiji Islands. Agricultural extension and research, strengthened to \nmeet the needs of farmers in the project area, will be better able to serve agricultural industries \nthroughout Fiji Islands. However, none of these flow-on benefits are included in the economic \nanalysis. It is envisaged that substantial benefits will arise from impacts and replication of \nproject activities outside the project area. \n \nB.   Economic Analysis \n \n  1.  Agricultural Diversification \n \n2.  A diversified 4-hectare (ha) farm is modeled for the future with project case. The land \ncapability of this model farm mirrors the land capability distribution of the industry as a whole. \nThe model farm grows a combination of field and horticulture crops on 80% of the area, uses \nsome of its marginal land for agro forestry and livestock (6%), and uses the remainder (14%) for \na house site and home garden. Such a diversified farm would be the product of the successful \nimplementation of the agricultural diversification component. \n \n3.  The  estimated  annual  gross  margin  from  the  diversified  farm  model  is  F$11,297 \n(US$5,793 equivalent). Thus if all the 19,200 ha available for diversified farming adopted similar \ndiversified farming systems,1 the economic farm gate value added in the future with project case \nis estimated at F$57.2 million per year (US$29.4 million equivalent). The estimated annual \ngross margin for the existing representative sugarcane farm is F$2,070 (US$1,062 equivalent). \nThe economic farm gate value added from the 19,200 ha under the present case is F$11.9 \nmillion per year (US$6.1 million equivalent). Thus the incremental economic farm gate value \nadded from complete diversification is estimated at F$45.3 million per year (US$23.3 million \nequivalent), i.e. the full 19,200 ha is developed from the present case use to the future with \nproject case use. \n \n4.  The  existing  representative  sugar  farm  model  is  based  on  a  sugarcane  price  of \nF$50/metric ton (t) (US$25.7/t equivalent). However at the projected sugarcane price of only \nF$37/t (US$19.0 equivalent), the annual gross margin of the farm falls to less than F$1,000 \n(US$514  equivalent)  unless  sugarcane  yields  can  be  significantly  improved.  In  these \ncircumstances, the value added if the 19,200 ha remain under sugarcane is F$5.2 million per \n                                                 \n1 Appendix 2, Table A2.6 projects a reduction in the number of productive farms from 17,297 to 12,500 so the \nequivalent of 4,797 farms are projected to be available for diversified agriculture. At a 4ha average farm size this is \nabout 19,200ha (4,797 x 4 = 19,188ha).

Thus the future \nincremental  economic  value  added  from  complete  diversification  is  F$52  million  per  year \n(US$27 million equivalent) at the farm gate level, i.e. the full 19,200 ha is developed from the \nfuture without project case use to the future with project case use. \n \n5.  Value-added benefits will accrue from marketing the produce from the farm gate to the \nfree on board level for exports or to the wholesale level for import substitution products. The \nmarketing value added is approximated at 20% of the farm gate value added. Thus adding the \nmarketing value, the estimated total incremental economic value is F$62.5 million per year \n(US$32.1 million equivalent). \n \n6.  If all 19,200 ha are converted to intensive diversified agriculture as described in the \nrepresentative farm model, the value of production would be well in excess of the estimated \nvalue of the additional readily obtainable markets. However, the analysis shows that markets \nare unlikely to constrain the diversified farm output.  \n \n7.  Different  adoption  rates  for  diversified  agriculture  are  analyzed  in  terms  of  their \neconomic  impact.  These  are  compared  with  the  economic  costs  of  the  agricultural \ndiversification, RFS, OFL, and project coordination components. The analysis assumes that \ndiversification practices represented in the farm model will be adopted over a 10-year period, \ncommencing in year 2. Rates of adoption ranging from 15% to 100% are analyzed. In the future, \nsome farms will be fully diversified along the lines of the representative farm model, others will \npartially adopt the proposed diversification practices, while others will not adopt the practices at \nall. The sum of these various permutations will represent the overall rate of adoption.  \n \n8.  Given the unlikely scenario of 100% adoption of the diversification practices, the Project \ngenerates an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 58% and an economic net present value \n(ENPV) of F$170 million at a 12% opportunity cost of capital. At 30% adoption of the indicative \nfarm model, the EIRR is 19.1%. Table A12.1 shows the impact of different adoption rates. It is \nonly when the adoption rate falls below about 20% that the Project is no longer considered \neconomically viable (EIRR < 12%; ENPV < 0). The achievement of the minimum diversification \nadoption rate required for economic viability is well within the capability of the Project. \n \nTable A12.1: Economic Rate of Return for Alternative Diversification Adoption Rates \n \nRate of Adoption After 10 Years (%)  EIRR (%)  ENPV discounted at 12% (F$ m) \n100  58.2  170.4   \n  75  44.9  117.1   \n  50  31.2  63.8   \n  30  19.1  21.2   \n  25  15.6  10.5   \n  20  12.0  (0.1)   \n  15  7.9  (10.8)   \n  10  3.2  (21.5)   \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return; ENPV = economic net present value. \nSource: Mission estimates. \n  \n9.  The  key  factors  that  will  determine  the  rate  of  adoption  are  (i)  sufficient  farmer \nconfidence in the land tenure system to make the required investments; (ii) availability of RFS \nfor project participants; (iii) success of the adaptive research and focused extension programs; \n(iv) transformation of farms into commercial businesses; (v) development of a cadre of young \ncommercial farmers; and (vi) future sugar prices, yields, and production costs. ", "60  Appendix 12 \n  2.  Rural Financial Services \n   \n10.  The availability of seasonal finance is a particular need for high-value diversification. \nThus all the costs of the RFS component have been attributed to the benefits of agricultural \ndiversification. It is projected that lending to rural households will increase from 8% of farming \nhouseholds to 20% over the project period. However, the benefits of the RFS component extend \nwell beyond diversified agriculture. New ventures created as a result of RFS are projected to \ncontribute at least F$3.4 million (US$1.8 million equivalent) in value added each year.  \n \n3.  Off-Farm Livelihoods \n \n11.  The OFL component involves two subcomponents. The first subcomponent focuses on \npromoting small and micro-enterprises and the second is directed at developing vocational \ntraining.  The  benefits  are  expected  to  be  considerable,  but  are  difficult  to  predict  with  a \nmeaningful degree of accuracy. However, an indication of the magnitude of these potential \nbenefits is that the projected 1,200 small and micro enterprises established by beneficiaries \nwould generate annual income of about F$7.5 million (US$3.9 million equivalent). \n \n4.  Overall Project \n \n12.  Table A12.2 compares overall project costs with the projected benefits derived from \nagricultural diversification. Provision is also made for the benefits from rural nonagricultural \nbusinesses established as a result of the RFS component. No allowance is made for the \nbenefits  accruing  from  the  OFL  component.  In  determining  the  benefits  from  agricultural \ndiversification, a 30% rate of adoption is assumed.  \n \nTable A12.2: Indicative Costs and Benefits of Project Components, 2006\u20132020  \n(US$ million) \n  Agric.

As  the  core  of  the  quantified  benefit  stream  is  derived  from  the  agricultural \ndiversification, the sensitivity analysis focuses on this component. The analysis assesses the \nimpact of adverse changes in costs, benefits, and diversification adoption rates. Various rates of \nadoption, a 10% increase in the development costs, and a 10% decline in diversified farm gross \nmargins are simulated. The results of this sensitivity analysis are given in Table A12.3. It shows \nthat in the base case, a diversification adoption rate in excess of 20% is required for the Project \nto be viable (EIRR > 12%).  If project costs increase by 10% or the gross margins decrease by \n10%, then the minimum rate of adoption required for viability increases, but remains below 25%.  \n \nTable A12.3: Sensitivity Analysis  \n(percent) \nCombined Cost \nRate of Diversification  10% Increase in  10% Decrease in \nBase Case  Increase and Benefit \nAdoption After 10 Years  Project Costs  Gross Margins \nDecrease \n100  58.2  53.0  52.5  47.8 \n75  44.9  40.9  40.5  36.8 \n50  31.2  28.2  27.9  25.1 \n30  19.1  16.8  16.6  14.4 \n25  15.6  13.6  13.3  11.4 \n20  12.0  10.0  9.8  8.0 \n15  7.9  6.1  5.9  4.3 \n10  3.2  1.6  1.4  (0.1) \nSource: Mission estimates. \n \n14.  At a 30% adoption rate, a 10% increase in costs sees the EIRR fall from 19.1% to \n16.8%, yielding a sensitivity index (SI) of 1.20. A 10% fall in gross margins at the same rate of \nadoption sees the EIRR fall to 16.6% (SI = 1.32). If both costs rise and gross margins fall by \n10%, the EIRR falls to 14.4%. These results suggest robust viability against cost and gross \nmargin variances provided a reasonable rate of adoption is achieved. \n \nC.    Financial Analysis \n \n  1.  Income of Farm Households \n \n15.  Representative farm analyses show that farmers have sufficient incentives in the form of \nhigher  net  returns,  increased  labor  productivity  and  on-farm  productive  employment,  and \nincreased cash portion of farm household incomes from diversification to move away from \nsugarcane into vegetables, fruits, and double-cropped grains and pulses with appropriate post \nharvest processes.

", "62  Appendix 12 \n   2.  Employment \n \n16.  On-farm employment for various rates of diversification adoption is presented in Table \nA12.5.  These  estimates  are  derived  from  representative  farm  models  and  compared  with \nrepresentative existing sugarcane farms. The achievement of a 30% adoption rate is considered \nto be a realistic target. This would generate an estimated 630,000 person-days of employment, \nor  approximately  745,000  person-days  of  labor  less  than  the  current  sugarcane  farming \nsituation.  Part  of  this  shortfall  will  be  compensated  for  by  rural  off-farm  work  linked  to \ndiversification efforts. Post harvest handling, transportation, and input supply and maintenance \nactivities  for  diversified  agriculture  are  relatively  labor  intensive,  and  these  activities  are \nexpected to provide at least 25% of on-farm labor absorption of diversified farming. Thus about \n600,000 person-days of employment will need to be found outside diversified agriculture. This \ntranslates  to  around  2,400  full-time  job  equivalents  that  the  OFL  component  will  need  to \ngenerate to achieve parity with the current situation. This is seen as a reasonably modest target. \n \nTable A12.5: On-Farm Employment Generated by Agricultural Diversification \n  \nArea  Labor used  Total labor  Total payment to \nItem  (ha)  (person day/ha/yr)   (person days)  labor (F$) \nRepresentative existing cane farms  19,200 71.7  1,376,640  13,766,400\n75% adoption of diversification  14,400 109.3  1,573,200  15,732,000\n65% adoption   12,480 109.3  1,363,440  13,634,400\n60% adoption   11,520 109.3  1,258,560  12,585,600\n50% adoption   9,600 109.3  1,049,280  10,492,800\n30% adoption  5,760 109.3  629,568  6,295,700\nSource: Mission estimates \n \n17.  The nature of employment in diversified agriculture is also qualitatively different from the \ncurrent sugarcane-based employment, in that diversified agriculture jobs are less seasonal in \nnature and offer many more employment opportunities for women. In addition, the efficiency of \nlabor utilization is also likely to improve. Households are also provided with off-farm livelihood \nopportunities through the OFL and RFS components. The RFS component provides households \nwith the opportunity to save and provides access to microfinance, which was not previously \navailable. Thus households will be able to mobilize resources for income generation, education, \nand prudential needs more efficiently. Training opportunities will be made more accessible to \ncommunities, reducing the need for households to migrate to Suva to meet their education \nrequirements.  Overall  the  Project  is  expected  to  substantially  improve  the  well-being  of \nhouseholds and communities compared with the current situation.  \n \n  3.  Impact on Consumers \n \n18.  The benefits accruing to consumers are as follows: (i) increased availability and lower \nprices of staples (root crops, pulses, and vegetables); (ii) higher-quality fruits and vegetables \navailable because of the expansion of exports and tourism sales and improved post harvest \nhandling; and (iii) improved nutrition resulting from increased consumption of fresh fruits and \nvegetables, pulses, and root crops. \n \nD.    Risks \n \n19.  The Project is economically, financially, and socially viable. The main benefits imputed \ninto the analysis are based on agricultural diversification. These diversification benefits are \nbased on identified and readily obtained markets. The adoption rates of diversified practices \nrequired for success are relatively modest. Yet the Project does entail significant risks. The \nestablishment and sustainable operations of efficient, self-financed industry organizations is ", "                           Appendix 12          63 \n \n \ncrucial for long-term sustainability and for increased adoption of crop diversification by farmers. \nIn addition, sufficient land must be available for diversified farming. While the gross margins \nupon which the benefits are derived are seen as realistic, the achievement of these returns \ndepends on the attainment of quality standards that most farmers in Fiji have not hitherto \nachieved. The Project needs to oversee a transformation from the dependency on sugarcane \nmentality to the business mentality of diversified crop production in a relatively short period. The \nProject will focus on this transformation, which is essential for the Project\u2019s success. \n \n20.  The Project also faces quarantine risks. The incursion of a new, exotic fruit fly would see \nthe cessation of most fruit and vegetable exports for several years. Market access for many of \nthe identified export products requires the negotiation of BQA with the importing countries, and \ntheir  willingness  to  assign  priority  and  resources  to  this  process  remains  a  risk.  The \nstrengthening  of  the  quarantine  service  is  the  Project\u2019s  response  directed  at  mitigating \nquarantine risks; however, assurances are required from the Government that it will devote \nadequate resources to quarantine surveillance. The strengthening of quarantine activities will \nmitigate the risk. \n \n21.  The lack of financial services to undertake income-generating and small farm livelihood \nactivities  under  the  Project  poses  a  risk  to  its  overall  success.  MASLR\u2019s  implementation \ncapability also needs to be strengthened through the Project Implementation Unit. Political \ninterference in the allocation and use of resources needs to be minimized if the Project is to \nsucceed in achieving its objectives. The Project will endeavor to secure privatized service \nproviders  to  ensure  long-term  sustainability.  Greater  skills  development  and  transfer  are \npriorities. The Project will mainly focus on individuals\u2019 skills development and empowerment.
