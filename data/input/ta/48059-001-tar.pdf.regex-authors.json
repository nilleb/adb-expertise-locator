INTRODUCTION \n1.  During  the  2013  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic of China (PRC), through the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP), requested \npolicy and advisory technical assistance (TA) from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a \nstudy on the national control of the important air pollutant\u2014volatile organic compounds (VOCs). \nThe TA was included in ADB\u2019s country operations business plan, 2014\u20132016.1 During the \nreconnaissance mission fielded on 11 April 2014, understanding and agreement were reached \non the project\u2019s impact, outcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, cost and financing \narrangements,  and  terms  of  reference  for  consultants  as  recorded  in  a  memorandum  of \nunderstanding. The design and monitoring framework (DMF) is in Appendix 1.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Air pollution emergencies are now a frequent occurrence in many cities throughout the \nPRC, leading to heightened concerns over public health. In response to the problem, the State \nCouncil promulgated the new Ambient Air Quality Standards in February 2012, which tightened \nthe limits on the concentration of nitrogen dioxide, PM , and other pollutants, and included new \n10\nstandards for PM  and ground-level ozone (O ).3 The Air Pollution Prevention and Control \n2.5 3\nAction Plan (the action plan) was issued in September 2013 and outlines the most stringent air \npollution control measure in the PRC\u2019s history. The action plan, along with the accountability \ndocuments  that  MEP  signed  with  each  provincial  government,  calls  for  5%\u201325%  cuts  in \nemissions of PM  and PM . Most recently, at the opening of the National People\u2019s Congress \n10 2.5\non 5 March 2014, Prime Minister Li Keqiang noted that \u201cwe will declare war against pollution \nand fight it with the same determination we battled poverty.\u201d4 This indicates the government\u2019s \nstrong commitment to tackling environmental pollution. \n \n3.  This TA supports the prevention and control of VOCs in the PRC. VOCs are recognized \nas precursors for the formation of O  and contribute to the formation of fine particles along with \n3\nother aerosols.5 O  and fine particles are important causes of photochemical smog and particle \n3\npollution. Further, many varieties of VOCs inflict direct harm on public health, such as benzene \nand methylene chloride. The prevention and control of VOCs has been a priority for MEP since \nthe issuance and implementation of the action plan. \n \n4.  Compared with other major pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and PM , \n10\nthe regulatory framework for the control of VOCs is lacking and scientific understanding of \nVOCs is far from meeting the requirements of policy makers. Major gaps to be filled are the \nneed for (i) a VOC emission inventory; (ii) a legal and regulatory framework, with clearly defined \nroles for national and subnational government departments in setting and implementing air \nquality and emission standards, permitting, and monitoring and enforcing; and (iii) approaches \nto reduce VOC emissions, including mandating best available control technologies and adopting \nnon-technology-based measures such as economic instruments and voluntary control measures. \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2014. Country Operations Business Plan: People\u2019s Republic of China, 2014\u20132016. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 June 2014. \n3  PM stands for particulate matter. PM includes both solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Many artificial \nand natural sources emit PM directly or emit other pollutants that react in the atmosphere to form PM. These solid \nand liquid particles come in a wide range of sizes (e.g. PM , PM ). \n2.5 10\nhttp://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/pm/pm25_index.html. \n4  Financial Times. Asia Pacific. China. http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5c9b4d18-a437-11e3-b915-00144feab7de.html \n5  Fine particles include PM , which causes significant health damages in the PRC. In the PRC, semivolatile organic \n2.5\ncompounds (along with primary organic aerosols) play an important role in aerosol formation. \n ", "2   \n \n5.  Understanding  the  emission  sources  is  a  basic  step  toward  providing  a  regulatory \nframework. An emission inventory provides (i) estimates of the contributions of various source \ncategories  to  overall  pollution  levels,  (ii)  a  basis  for  determining  control  measures  to  be \nimplemented, and (iii) a means to monitor progress in reducing emissions and to measure the \neffectiveness of chosen control strategies. Past and ongoing research efforts have been made \nin establishing national, city, and regional level emission inventories for VOCs, using various \nestimation methodologies. Results from these inventories are inconsistent, due to large and \ninherent uncertainties in modeling and inaccurate and incomplete knowledge about source \nprofiles, emission factors, and source activities. To have a basis for regulation, it is important to \nclarify the needs for and selection of methodologies for national and subnational emission \ninventories, taking into account priority of source categories, desired accuracy, and resource \nrequirements. \n \n6.  Although there are large discrepancies in estimates, existing inventories show that the \npetrochemical industry, motor vehicles, and surface coating are among the major sources of \nVOC emissions in the PRC. Among these sources, the petrochemical industry can account for \n10%\u201323% of VOC emissions and these emissions are fast growing as a result of increasing \ncapacity  expansion.6 The  action  plan  also  calls  for  improving  VOC  control  measures  by \ntargeting stationary sources, which makes the petrochemical industry a top priority. With regard \nto mobile sources, the action plan sets clear targets for phasing out high-polluting vehicles (the \nso called \u201cyellow label vehicles\u201d) in the three key regions \u2014 Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Pearl River \nDelta, and Yangtzi River Delta\u2014and provides a clear road map for upgrading fuel quality. These \nmeasures will help reduce emission of VOCs as well as other pollutants from motor vehicles. \n \n7.  ADB has provided a range of support to improve air quality in developing member \ncountries, including the PRC. In the PRC, ADB supported (i) the establishment of regional \nenvironmental supervision centers in 2007,7 which will be important in enforcing the regional \ncollaboration  mechanisms  of  the  action  plan;  (ii)  the  design  of  the  national  sulfur  dioxide \nemissions trading system in 2009;8 and (iii) sustainable transport and clean energy projects to \nreduce air pollution, including low-carbon transport, and piloting cutting-edge renewable energy \nand  clean  coal technologies.9 Regionally,  ADB,  along  with the World Bank, supported  the \nestablishment of Clean Air Asia, which is committed to promoting better air quality in Asian cities \nthrough sharing knowledge and experiences among stakeholders. ADB is currently preparing a \nregional TA on Rolling Out the Clean Air Scorecard in Asian Cities to help cities improve their \ncapacity for air quality management.  \n \n8.  The proposed TA is the first initiative on VOC pollution control in the PRC. Based on the \nPRC\u2019s needs regarding pollution control, and building on past ADB initiatives, the TA will help \ndevelop a road map for improving the control of VOC emissions from industrial sources in the \nPRC,  including  requirements  for  a  legislative  framework,  institutional  arrangements,  and \nregulations.  In  addition,  the  TA  will  help  prepare  an  outline  management  plan  for  the \npetrochemical industry for the control and prevention of VOC emissions. \n                                                \n6  Estimates provided by Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division, Pollution Prevention and Control Department, \nMinistry of Environmental Protection. \n7  ADB. 2005.

The national 12th Five-Year Plan includes the government\u2019s long-term goal of building a \nharmonious  and  prosperous  society  through  environmentally  sustainable  growth.  The \nsubsequent  12th  Five-Year  Plan  on  the  Environment  calls  for  strengthened  control  and \nmonitoring of VOCs, among other air pollutants. In parallel with the government\u2019s strategy, the \nTA is also in line with ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy, 2011\u20132015 for the PRC, which \nsupports the government\u2019s goal of building a harmonious society by promoting environmentally \nsustainable development.10 The TA will contribute to a cleaner and more sustainable growth \nprocess by strengthening the capacity for environmental management. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact will be improved air quality through effective VOC emission control in the \nPRC. Comprehensive VOC control measures will be implemented in key industries by 2017. \nThe outcome will be improved management of VOC emissions through introducing a new policy \nand regulatory framework in the PRC. A proposed strategy to improve the policy and regulatory \nframework will be endorsed by the TA consultative committee and submitted to higher-level \ndecision makers at MEP for consideration by the first quarter of 2016. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The TA will produce the following outputs: (i) a review of the current status in the PRC \nand international experience in VOC management, (ii) a strategy to improve the policy and \nregulatory framework for the prevention and reduction of VOC emissions, and (iii) a knowledge \nproduct summarizing the key findings. \n \n12.  Output 1: A review of the current status in the People\u2019s Republic of China and \ninternational experience in VOC management. This output will involve the following: \n \n(i)  A review of existing national and subnational VOC emission inventories in the \nPRC  will  be  conducted,  to  identify  key  industrial  sources  and  evaluate \nmethodologies used by existing national, regional, and city level inventories. Key \nchallenges in establishing national and subnational inventories will be identified, \nand  recommendations  will  be  provided  on  standardized  emission  inventory \nstructures for the selected key sources.  Further, current VOC control efforts in \nthe PRC will be reviewed, including policies, legislations, standards, institutional \narrangements, and control technologies. \n(ii)  A review of international experience will also be conducted in the prevention and \ncontrol of VOC emissions. Based on challenges identified in the current status \nreview  of  the  PRC  situation,  review  relevant  international  experience  in \nestablishing  VOC  emission  inventories,  data  and  information  management,   \nreview reporting and documentation requirements, and key steps and options in \npolicy, administrative, and legal aspects of rule making related to prevention and \nreduction of VOC emissions. \n \n13.  Output  2:  A  strategy  to  improve  the  policy  and  regulatory  framework  for  the \nprevention and reduction of volatile organic compound emissions. A road map will be \n                                                \n10  ADB. 2012. People\u2019s Republic of China: Country Partnership Strategy, 2011\u20132015. Manila. \n ", "4   \nprepared for establishing a management framework for the prevention and reduction of VOC \nemissions in the PRC. Drawing on relevant international experience, the road map will outline \nmain categories of VOC emissions and policy options to prevent and reduce these emissions, in \nterms  of  defining  roles  and  responsibilities  of  key  stakeholders,  introducing  necessary \nlegislations  or  amendments,  management  plans,  regulations,  and  technical  guidelines.  To \ndemonstrate how to implement the road map, an outline management plan will be prepared for \nthe prevention and reduction of VOC emissions from the petrochemical industry in the PRC. \nThe outline management plan will include total pollution load control target, regulations, and \ntechnical guidelines. \n \n14.  Output  3:  A  knowledge  product  summarizing  the  key  findings. The knowledge \nproduct will be published in English and Chinese, and a dissemination plan will be prepared. \n \n15.  There  are  no  major  risks  associated  with  the  TA,  but  restructuring  of  government \ndepartments concerned and coordination challenges are possible. The main assumptions are \nthat  relevant  central  government  departments  will  adopt  the  policy  and  regulatory \nrecommendations  developed  under  the  TA  and  allocate  funds  accordingly.  A  secondary \nassumption  is  that  international  experience  can  be  adapted  to  the  institutional  and \nsocioeconomic situation in the PRC. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $450,000, of which $400,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources). The government will \nprovide counterpart support in the form of remuneration and per diems for counterpart staff, \nincluding  counterpart  staff\u2019s  time,  remuneration,  and  travel  expenses;  logistics  support  in \narrangement of workshops and conferences; and a fully functional office space for consultants, \nwith free water and utility supply, and free access to internet and photocopying machine, and \nother in-kind contributions. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  MEP  will  be  the  executing  agency.  A  TA  consultative  committee,  led  by  MEP\u2019s \nDepartment of Pollution Prevention and Control, will be established to provide guidance on \nproject implementation. The committee will comprise the deputy director general and a director \nof  the  Department  of  Pollution  Prevention  and  Control,  and  a  director  of  the  Project \nManagement Division 1 of the Foreign Economic Cooperation Office (FECO) of MEP. FECO will \nbe the implementing agency, and a TA management office will be established in FECO to carry \nout day-to-day TA operations. The director of the Project Management Division 1 of FECO will \nserve as the executive director of the TA management office responsible for coordinating day-\nto-day operational matters between ADB, consultants, and government agencies. \n \n18.  A  consulting  firm  will  be  engaged  to  assist  ADB  and  the  executing  agency  in  the \nimplementation of the TA. The firm will provide a total of 32 person-months of consulting \nservices, which will involve two international consultants (6 person-months) and four national \nconsultants (26 person-months). The consultants will be engaged following ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), using the quality- and cost-based \nselection  method,  with  a  quality\u2013cost  ratio  of  90:10,  and  by  inviting  a  simplified  technical \nproposal. The quality of the consulting services is of overriding importance for the outcome of \nthe project, as the TA undertakes an urgent and high-priority task of the government with large \ndownstream impacts. In addition, the services require highly specialized knowledge about the \n ", "  5 \nindustries  that  are  important  sources  of  VOC  emissions.  The  TA  funds  will  be  disbursed \nfollowing ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to \ntime). Resource persons may be recruited to provide specific advice on the strategic framework \nor management plan as needed. \n \n19.  The TA will be implemented tentatively from 1  December 2014 to 30 March 2016. \nInception, interim, and final review missions will be fielded. Tripartite discussions will be held \nduring the missions to review the consultants\u2019 performance, overall TA implementation, and \nstatus  of  deliverables  based  on  the  DMF  of  the  TA.  The  missions  will  also  monitor  the \ngovernment\u2019s inputs and contributions. The performance of the TA, including its outcome and \noutputs, will be evaluated during the final review mission based on the DMF. Good practices \nand lessons learned will be disseminated through workshops and publication of a knowledge \nproduct. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n20.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Study on the National Control of the \nImportant Air Pollutant\u2014Volatile Organic Compounds, and hereby reports this action to the \nBoard. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  Performance Targets  Data Sources and   \n  and Indicators with  Reporting   \nDesign Summary  Baselines  Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved air quality  Compared to 2012,  MEP annual  The government continues to \nthrough effective VOC  concentration of PM environmental reports  support prevention and control \n10 \nemission control in the  reduced by at least 10%,    of VOC emissions \nPRC  and PM  reduced by  13th Five-Year Plan   \n2.5\nabout 25% in Beijing- Relevant central government \nTianjin-Hebei region, by  departments will adopt the \n20% in the Yangtze River  policy and regulatory \nDelta region, and 15% in  recommendations developed \nthe Pearl River Delta  under the TA, and allocate \nregion by 2017  funds accordingly \nOutcome      Assumption \nImproved management  Proposed regulatory  TA reports  A secondary assumption is \nof VOC emissions  framework is endorsed by    that government officials are \nthrough introducing a  MEP management by  Relevant government  receptive to adapting \nnew policy and  2016  agencies\u2019 comments  international best practices to \nregulatory framework in  on the strategic  PRC circumstances \nthe PRC  framework during the \nfinal review workshop \n \nGovernment policy \nannouncements, \nnotices, or public \nspeeches of officials \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
