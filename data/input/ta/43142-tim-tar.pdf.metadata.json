INTRODUCTION \n1.  Timor-Leste  is  a  young  nation  that  faces  significant  challenges  in  rebuilding  its \ninfrastructure,  strengthening  the  civil  administration,  and  generating  jobs  for  young  people \nentering the workforce. In late 2007, the new government announced plans aimed at increasing \nspending, reducing poverty, and improving the country's infrastructure. These plans will require \nbetter statistical capability for national policy formulation and to help measure the impact of \ngovernment development policies on society and the economy. \n \n2.  The  Timor-Leste  country  operations  business  plan  2008\u20132010 1  of  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) aims to build the government's capacity to manage and deliver \nquality  basic  social  services.  A  country  partnership  strategy  for  2009\u20132012  is  now  being \nfinalized.2 This includes a focus on building state capacity, particularly in core areas of public \nadministration (including statistics). The Government of Timor-Leste has reaffirmed its desire for \nADB  to  assist  in  this  area,  including  in  statistics  capacity  building  and  macroeconomic \nmanagement within the Ministry of Finance. \n \n3.  The technical assistance (TA) will support the National Directorate of Statistics (NDS) to \nmanage Timor-Leste's statistical system and enhance the capacity of the National Directorate of \nMacro-economy to provide macroeconomic advice and analysis. Both directorates are part of \nthe General Directorate of Policy Analysis and Research within the Ministry of Finance. The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n4.  In conceptualizing the assistance, extensive consultations were conducted during the \npreparation of a long-term statistical capacity building TA program for Timor-Leste.3 A country \nconsultation  mission  took  place  in  June  2009  and  held  preliminary  discussions  with  the \ngovernment on the TA. Further consultations were conducted in September 2009.4 The major \nagreements  with  the  government  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, cost, financing arrangements, and terms of reference are reflected in this TA \npaper. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n5.  In addition to the increasing demand for statistics for national policy formulation and to \nhelp measure the impact of development policies on society and the economy, increasing \ninternational cooperation and globalization have created a demand for statistics that will allow \nTimor-Leste to compare its national economic and social indicators against other countries. A \nprimary  requirement  for  national  benchmarking  is  that  the  national  statistical  system  can \nproduce  high-quality  information  that  is  consistent  with  that  gathered  for  other  developing \ncountries. The production of Timor-Leste statistics must be as timely as that of other countries in \nAsia and the Pacific so that the country can measure its economic and social performance \nrelative to them. Timor-Leste, despite its small size and relatively limited capacity, must develop \nand maintain a statistical system that supports economic monitoring and policy analysis and \nfacilitates international comparison. \n \n6.  In addition, the requirement for diverse information has created many new demands and \nresponsibilities for national statistical agencies. In the past, much statistical work focused on \nmeeting the needs of key domestic users and international organizations. Now many see a key \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2007. Country Operations Business Plan: Timor-Leste, 2008\u20132010. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2009.

Report on Long-Term \nStatistical Capacity Building for Timor-Leste. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 6 October 2009. \n ", "2   \nrole for statistics in the evolution of a more open civil society. The role of statistical agencies is \ngradually changing from the basic tasks of collecting statistics to assisting users to make \nappropriate use of them. This means providing more analysis and interpretation of key trends. \nTraditional paper publications are being replaced by more detailed data in electronic form. \n \n7.  The statistical system in Timor-Leste is not currently capable of responding to these \ndemands. The system lags behind in terms of relevance, periodicity and timeliness, except for \nthe production of the consumer price index (CPI) and trade statistics. Only the CPI, trade, fiscal, \nmonetary and banking statistics are published regularly. National accounts, labor statistics, \npoverty statistics and others are not produced regularly. The NDS lacks funding and its staff are \nnot well trained, especially in survey design, data processing, and analysis. On-the-job training \nhas been successfully implemented for CPI and trade statistics and needs to be extended to \nother areas. \n \n8.  Under  a  TA  on  Statistical  Capacity  Building  in  the  Asia  and  Pacific  Region,5 ADB \nassessed  the  statistical  capacity,  constraints,  and  needs  of  developing  member  countries \n(DMCs); identified DMCs that were statistically very weak; and developed separate long-term \nstatistical capacity building TA programs for some of them. Timor-Leste was one of four DMCs \nidentified as requiring technical assistance in the first phase.6 In Mongolia, Nepal, and Timor-\nLeste,  a  diagnostic  study  of  the  countries'  statistical  systems  was  undertaken  in  close \nconsultation with the national statistics offices, and other major stakeholders, and a long-term \nstatistical  capacity  building  TA  program  was  developed.  More  recently,  the  Timor-Leste \ngovernment, with the assistance of the World Bank and other donors, initiated a project to \ndevelop a statistical work plan. The resulting report reinforces the approach identified in the \nlong-term statistical capacity building TA program.7 \n \n9.  The  statistical  capacity  building  TA  program  for  Timor-Leste  (footnote  3)  has  the \nfollowing components: (i) build the management capacity of the management of the NDS and \nthe national statistical system, (ii) define and develop a statistical work program for the NDS, (iii) \nimprove national accounts statistics,8 (iv) undertake a labor force survey, (v) establish new \nstatistics legislation, (vi) undertake staff development, (vii) improve dissemination of statistical \ndata, and (viii) establish a basic information technology infrastructure. Each of the components \nin the program is described below.  \n \n10.  Build  management  capacity.  Building  the  managerial  capacity  of  the  NDS \nmanagement and the line ministries is a priority. This will improve coordination across the \nnational statistical system and encourage data sharing. Under the statistical capacity building \nTA program, this component has three subcomponents: (i) provide professional management \ntraining to the director of NDS, (ii) conduct basic management training for senior statistical \nofficials, and (iii) organize study visits for senior management of NDS. The World Bank intends \nto  recruit  a  consultant  under  its  Public  Financial  Management  Capacity  Building  Program \n(PFMCBP) to strengthen the institutional capacity of the NDS. \n \n11.  Define and develop a statistical work program. At the time the statistical capacity \nbuilding TA program was being prepared, there was a requirement to specify what statistical \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2008. Technical Assistance for Statistical Capacity Building in the Asia and Pacific Region. Manila. \n6  Afghanistan, Mongolia, and Nepal were the other three. ADB has also recently prepared diagnostic studies of the \nnational statistical system with action plans for statistical capacity building for Cambodia (2008) and Lao People's \nDemocratic Republic (2008). A diagnostic study of the national statistical system for the Maldives is in progress \nand a statistical capacity building TA program for Nepal has been initiated. \n7  Ministry of Finance. 2009. A Statistical Work Plan (2010\u20132019). Dili. \n8  Defined as statistics measuring the performance of the economy as a whole (and various sectors of the economy), \nsuch as gross domestic product (GDP).  \n ", "  3\nwork was being undertaken and what was planned over the next 3 years. Further, there was an \nurgent  need  to  determine  the  statistical  system's  users'  priority  needs,  including  the \nrequirements needed from such sources as the national development plan and the general data \ndissemination system. While further work remains to be undertaken under this component \nthrough the completion of the statistical work plan (2010\u20132019)9 and other similar reports, \nprogress is being made. \n \n12.  Improve  national  accounts.  Timor-Leste  does  not  have  any  system  of  compiling \nregular national accounts statistics. Only ad hoc estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) are \navailable.  There  is  a  need  to  provide  updated  estimates  for  recent  years  and  build  a \ncomprehensive program for establishing a system of national accounts in the medium and long \nterms. Existing donor support has been provided to various initiatives under this component. \nThis includes ongoing support by a national accounts advisor to the NDS under the World \nBank's PFMCBP. The support started in April 2009 and will last for 1 year with a possibility of \nfurther extension. The government has sought ADB assistance to enhance data collection on \nbusiness enterprises and agriculture to improve national accounts statistics. \n \n13.  Undertake a labor force survey. The high unemployment rate in Timor-Leste poses \nsignificant challenges for development in the country. Therefore, it is important to have accurate \nand reliable data on the labor force in Timor-Leste to devise strategies to reduce unemployment. \nThe International Labour Organization is currently providing assistance in this area.10 \n \n14.  Establish new statistics legislation. The present law governing statistics in Timor-\nLeste is weak and incomplete. There is an urgent and high-priority need for new legislation that \ncan safeguard statistical independence, the secrecy of the information collected, and the rights \nand obligations of statistical officers. The World Bank proposes to provide assistance for the \ndrafting of statistics legislation.11 \n \n15.  Undertake staff development. The staff of NDS have limited capacity in areas such as \nsurvey design, survey management, data processing and analysis, and there is considerable \nneed for capacity building in all these areas. The English language skills of the staff need to be \nsignificantly improved because most statistical documentation and international meetings are \nconducted in English. Only a few staff have appropriate tertiary education.  \n \n16.  Improve  dissemination  of  statistical  data. Data dissemination is very limited and \nrudimentary. There is a significant need to ensure that statistics are released in a usable form \nand  in  a  timely  fashion  to  users.  Ongoing  support  is  being  provided  by  a  long-term \ndissemination advisor and a local publications officer under the sponsorship of Portuguese \nCooperation and the United Nations Population Fund respectively. \n \n17.  Establish  a  basic  information  technology  infrastructure. The use of information \ntechnology in statistical work in Timor-Leste is very rudimentary, and it needs to be established \nin an effective and efficient way. \n \n18.  In addition to requesting support for implementation of the statistical capacity building TA \nprogram, the Ministry of Finance has requested ADB support to improve macroeconomic advice \n                                                 \n9  Ministry of Finance. 2009.

This  will  help  to  enhance  the  robustness  and  timeliness  of  analysis  that  is \nundertaken. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n19.  The TA is intended to enhance the statistical system in Timor-Leste to enable relevant, \nreliable, regular, and timely statistics to be produced for analysis and dissemination by building \non  the  long-term  statistical  capacity  building  TA  program.  This  is  to  be  achieved  through \ntargeted interventions in priority areas, building on previous work by ADB and other donors. The \nselection of priority areas was based on discussions with the government. In addition, the TA is \ndesigned to enhance the capacity of the National Directorate of Macro-economy to provide \nmacroeconomic advice and analysis. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n20.  The TA will focus on building the capacity of the staff of the NDS by supporting them to \ndesign  and  conduct  a  business  activity  survey  (which  will  include  the  development  of  a \nstatistical business register) and an agricultural production survey.12 The TA will support the \ncollection, validation, processing, analysis, use, and dissemination of the survey data by the \nNDS. Training covering basic statistical skills such as data collection, validation, processing, \nanalysis, dissemination, and decision-making as well as computer skills including the use of MS \nOffice and specialized statistical software packages will be provided. \n \n21.  The key data to be collected or calculated as part of the surveys will be those largely \nrequired for computing GDP.13 A key component of the surveys will involve the provision of \nhands-on training and mentoring to NDS staff so they have the capacity to conduct subsequent \nsurveys without the assistance of development partners. The government has indicated that it is \nincreasing the budget for NDS to enable it to fund future annual surveys. To support these \nefforts, it will be recruiting three or four more permanent staff for the Department of Economic \nStatistics (part of the NDS) in 2010. This will help in the development of a system to compile \nregular national accounts statistics. \n \n22.  In addition, the TA will (i) establish a twinning arrangement with an appropriate nearby \ngovernment statistical agency that can provide ongoing support and expertise to enhance the \ncapacity of the management of the NDS through activities such as at least one study visit, and \n(ii) support English language skills training for staff of the NDS by utilizing a local training \nprovider to provide in-house tailored English language classes and by supporting the acquisition \nof relevant English language training software. The study visit and twinning arrangement will be \npart of a long-term partnering arrangement with a nearby government statistical agency that will \nensure the long-term sustainability of the TA. \n \n23.  The TA will also support the Ministry of Finance to provide macroeconomic advice and \nanalysis. This resource will be available to provide rapid analysis on key economic issues as \nthey arise and as opportunities for effective engagement present themselves. \n \n                                                 \n12 Should it be necessary to focus on particular business sectors (e.g., hotels, transportation, education, and health) \nor agriculture sectors, these will be determined jointly by ADB and NDS. For the agriculture production survey, \nwhere appropriate, inputs will also be sought from the Ministry of Agriculture. \n13 This will include gross output, sales, intermediate inputs, changes in inventories, value-added taxes, gross \noperating surplus, gross fixed capital formation, and number and compensation of employees. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing \n24.  The TA is estimated to cost $630,000 equivalent. The government has requested ADB \nfinancing of $560,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB's Technical \nAssistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will finance the balance of the cost, \nequivalent to $70,000, through provision of office accommodation, counterpart staff, logistical \nand publishing support for the surveys, and other in-kind contributions. Appendix 2 provides \ndetails of the cost estimates and financing plan. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in line \nwith the Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook.14 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n25.  The NDS will be the executing agency for the TA and will implement the statistical \ncomponents, while ADB's Special Office in Timor-Leste will be the implementing agency for the \nmacroeconomic  component.  Where  appropriate,  ADB's  Special  Office  in  Timor-Leste  will \ncoordinate with the NDS in implementing the statistical component. The government will appoint \na TA focal point who will be responsible for coordinating with and providing progress reports to \nADB. The government will also provide partial funding for surveys to be conducted under the TA \nand to provide ADB with the data and results of these surveys.15 \n \n26.  The TA will be implemented over 30 months, starting in February 2010. The TA will \nfinance  up  to  19  person-months  of  international  consulting  services.  The  international \nconsultants will comprise: (i) statistics expert and team leader (international, 6 person-months, \nintermittent); (ii) business activity survey advisor (international, 5 person-months, intermittent); \n(iii) agricultural production activity survey advisor (international, 4 person-months, intermittent); \nand  (iv)  economist  (international,  4  person-months,  intermittent).  The  expected  financial \ncompletion date of the TA is December 2012. \n \n27.  ADB will engage all consultants as individuals in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on \nthe Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The terms of reference for \nconsultants are in Appendix 3. Individual consultants are needed, as a single firm may be \nunable to provide consultants with all the required expertise and experience. Procurement will \nbe undertaken in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time \nto time). Any equipment that is purchased using the TA budget will be handed over to the \ngovernment after the completion of the TA. \n \n28.  The  TA  will  be  implemented  in  close  cooperation  with  other  agencies  involved  in \nstatistics collection. In addition, the TA will work closely with the World Bank's PFMCBP in the \nMinistry  of  Finance,  as  well  as  with  other  development  partners.  The  World  Bank  will \ncomplement ADB's assistance by supporting the drafting of new statistics legislation and by \nfunding  an  advisory  position  within  the  NDS,  along  with  its  broader  efforts  to  improve \nexpenditure and revenue management under its PFMCBP. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n29.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $560,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste for Statistical and Macroeconomic \nCapacity Building, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n                                                 \n14 ADB. 2008.

The work under this technical assistance (TA) will be implemented in a phased manner \nover the period 2010\u20132012. \n \n2.  All consultants will be briefed by staff from the Government of Timor-Leste and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) prior to commencing work. Consultants will be required to review all \nrelevant  literature  prior  to  beginning  work,  including  the  Report  on  Long-Term  Statistical \nCapacity Building for Timor-Leste,1 A Statistical Work Plan,2 and Review and Action Plan for the \nStatistical System in Timor-Leste.3 When carrying out their assignments, they will report to the \nappropriate agencies (i.e., the National Directorate of Statistics (NDS) or National Directorate of \nMacro-economy) within the Ministry of Finance and ADB. \n \nA.  Statistics Expert and Team Leader (international, 6-person months, intermittent) \n3.  The statistics expert and team leader should have extensive experience gained from \nworking  in  a  senior  management  role  in  a  national  statistics  agency  (or  equivalent)  and \nextensive knowledge of the capacity of national statistical systems around the region. He or she \nshould have a strong theoretical background, wide expertise, and sufficient practical experience \nin such areas as national accounts, undertaking of surveys, and dissemination of statistics. \nExperience in leading a team of consultants in implementing statistical capacity building TA \nprojects will be an advantage. \n \n4.  Working under the guidance of ADB and the NDS within the Ministry of Finance, and \nworking closely with NDS staff, the statistics expert will have overall responsibility for developing \nand  implementing  the statistical components  of the  TA by  supporting  the  completion  of  a \nbusiness activity survey and agricultural production survey.
