The Government of India ratified the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework \nConvention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  in  August  2002,  before  the  Eighth  Annual \nConference of Parties (COP-8) to the UNFCCC, held in New Delhi in October-November 2002 \nand subsequently approved the establishment of the National Clean Development Mechanism \nAuthority (NCDMA) on 2 December 2003. The Government requested the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) to provide technical assistance (TA) for capacity building for the clean development \nmechanism (CDM) in India.1 The Fact-Finding mission2 visited India on 28 July\u20133 August 2004 \nto formulate the proposed TA project and reached an understanding with the Government on \nthe  goals,  purpose,  scope,  implementation  arrangements,  cost  estimates,  financing \narrangements, and terms of reference for consultants. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.3  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  The increasing level of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere is becoming a \nsignificant international environmental challenge, causing global warming and resultant climate \nchanges. Recognizing this potential risk, UNFCCC adopted the Kyoto Protocol in 1997. CDM is \none of the three project-based flexible mechanisms that enable a developed country4 entity to \nacquire emission reduction credits from GHG-reducing activities implemented in a developing \ncountry at a relatively lower cost. CDM is thus a market-based instrument that allows developed \ncountries  to  meet  their  emission  reduction  commitments  while  bringing  additional  financial \nresources to developing countries to achieve sustainable development.  \n \n3.  UNFCCC  has  established  elaborate  and  complex  procedures  to  ensure  the \nenvironmental integrity of projects that have CDM benefits. Important milestones of these multi-\nstakeholder procedures include preparation of a CDM project design document (PDD). This \nneeds to be endorsed first by the host country government, indicating that the project will meet \nthe sustainable development criteria. The PDD then needs to be validated by internationally \naccredited external organizations, called operational entities, to ensure that the project meets \nthe additionality requirements, using baseline information and a methodology for estimating \nexpected  GHG  emission  reduction.  The  operational  entity,  acting  on  behalf  of  the  project \ndeveloper, submits the PDD to UNFCCC's CDM executive board for registration of the CDM \nproject and approval of proposed emission reduction into certified emission reduction (CER) \ncredits. \n \n4.  India is the sixth largest emitter of global GHGs, contributing annually about 1 billion tons \nof carbon dioxide emissions equivalent (tCO e), even though it accounts for only 3% of the total \n2\nemissions. India's per capita GHG emission (about 1.2 tCO e) is one fifth of the global average.  \n2\nAn ADB study5 shows that, of India\u2019s total GHG emissions, carbon dioxide (CO ) accounts for \n2\n35%; methane, for 39%; and nitrous oxide, for 8%. The energy sector is the main emitter of CO  \n2\n(87%); the remainder comes mainly from the cement industry (4%) and land conversion (9%). \nLivestock accounts for 42% and paddy cultivation for 23% of methane emissions. As significant \n                                                 \n1  The TA concept paper was approved by ADB Vice President, Operations 1, on 23 July 2004.  \n2  The Mission consisted of A. Sarkar, energy specialist, Regional and Sustainable Development Department, \nFinance and Infrastructure Division (RSFI)  (mission leader); and G. Mahajan, environmental specialist, India \nResident Mission. R. Nangia, director, RSFI; and S. Tumiwa, energy specialist, South Asia Energy Division, \nsupported the mission from the ADB headquarters.  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 27 July 2004.  \n4  Also referred to as Annex I country under the Kyoto Protocol. \n5  ADB. 1998. Asia Least-cost Greenhouse Gas Abatement Strategy (ALGAS) Report. Manila.  \n ", "2  \npotential  for  GHG  reduction  at  low  marginal  abatement  costs  is  available  across  energy, \ntransport, forestry, agriculture, and other sectors, India has the potential to play a major role in \nthe global CDM market. The Government has completed major steps after ratification of the \nKyoto Protocol and established NCDMA in December 2003,6 comprising an interministerial \ncommittee, headed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF). \n \n5.  NCDMA has policy development, regulatory, and promotional roles to create an enabling \nenvironment for a competitive CDM market. The authority has set up an efficient, streamlined \nprocess for consideration and approval of PDDs within 60 days of submission.7 However, CDM \nis a new field with limited internal capacity within the Government. Although the required central \ninstitutional framework is in place, India, like many other developing member countries (DMCs), \nlacks broad-based capacity for CDM support at all critical levels beyond NCDMA. CDM project \nidentification, evaluation, assessment, and support have not been mainstreamed into other \ncentral,  state,  and  local  regulatory  agencies  and  ministries.  Substantial  external  effort  is \nrequired to build their capacity. \n \n6.  India has an estimated 200 CDM projects in various phases of preparation. About 30 \nprojects, mostly large-volume energy projects from the industry sector, have been endorsed by \nNCDMA for further processing by the CDM executive board. Many GHG reduction projects with \nthe potential for becoming high-quality CDM projects are in the nonenergy sectors, at the small-\nscale  rural  and  municipality  levels.8  Knowledge  of  best-practice  guidelines  for  establishing \nbaselines and methodologies for developing PDDs in many such sectors (rural, small-scale \nindustry, coal bed and coal mine methane, municipal landfill gas, forestry, etc.) remain limited. \nThis is exacerbated by the risks perceived by, and lack of awareness among, potential project \npromoters and local and state-level regulatory bodies.  \n \n7.  Domestic financial and risk insurance sectors do not understand CDM projects well; \nthus, few CDM projects have been able to obtain financing, even after approval by NCDMA. \nTransaction  costs,  though  declining,  still  remain  significant.  The  CDM  market  remains \ndominated by a few entities such as the Prototype Carbon Fund and the Government of the \nNetherlands\u2019 ERUPT/CERUPT9 programs, and Indian project developers (sellers of emission \nreduction credits) have little leverage to influence emission reduction prices.10 \n \n8.  The CDM is emerging as a key vehicle of multilateral cooperation to tackle the potential \nrisks of global climate change.11  The CDM is consistent with the objectives of environmental \n                                                 \n6  The Seventh Annual Conference of Parties to UNFCCC in Marrakech in 2001 decided that parties participating in \nthe CDM should designate a national authority to evaluate, approve, and endorse projects that help achieve \nsustainable development. NCDMA was established through Cabinet approval on 2 December 2003. \n7  The interministerial NCDMA meets regularly to evaluate and endorse CDM project proposals. \n8  At current carbon prices, the impact on the internal rates of return of sales of carbon credits for \u201ctraditional\u201d energy \nprojects is minimal (2\u20134%), making them less attractive to investors than projects that reduce other GHGs (e.g., \nmethane, which is 21 times more potent, in global warming terms, than CO ).  \n2\n9  ERUPT = emission reduction unit purchasing procurement tender; CERUPT = certified emission reduction unit \npurchasing procurement tender \n10  Few domestic financial players or market intermediaries provide the debt and/or equity finance to enable CDM \nprojects to be developed and generate emission reduction, particularly for small-scale rural and municipality \nprojects. The possibility of banking the CER credits for later trading cycles and carryovers, even beyond the first \ncommitment period, has been contemplated but not addressed. \n11 ADB has been involved in capacity building in CDM in several DMCs since 2002, through its Renewable Energy, \nEnergy Efficiency, and Climate Change (REACH) Program. ADB established a CDM facility in August 2003, which \nprovides risk-free assistance to prepare and process CDM components of ADB's loan projects in DMCs. The \nfacility does not purchase emission reduction credits but helps identify potential buyers of such credits generated \nby CDM projects, and facilitates their transactions with the DMCs.  \n ", "  3\nprotection,  which  is  one  of  the  main  elements  of  ADB's  overall  operational  strategy  for \nassistance to India, described in its Country Strategy and Program (2003-2006). CDM gives \nIndia an opportunity to follow the path of sustainable development by providing access to \nadditional  resources  for  adopting  technologies  that  reduce  GHG  emissions.  A  developed \ndomestic CDM capacity could ensure India's effective participation in the global carbon market. \n \n9.  The Government, in collaboration with multilateral and bilateral development partners,12 \nhas launched a national CDM strategy. The capacity-building initiatives are creating a local base \nof CDM expertise, primarily among energy-sector project developers and promoters. The TA \ninterventions will complement the capacity-building initiatives of the Government. Nonenergy \ncomponents of the CDM market will also be covered, and capacity-building needs of the state, \nmunicipality, local, and rural stakeholders and of the financial and risk insurance industry will be \naddressed. MoEF will establish a CDM development coordination committee to coordinate the \nactivities of various development partners, including ADB.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Purpose and Output \n \n10.  The TA\u2019s goal is to reduce GHGs efficiently by implementing CDM projects. The TA\u2019s \npurpose is to provide broad-based capacity-building support to various stakeholders in specific \nCDM sectors and selected areas to strengthen India's overall position as one of the key players \nin the evolving international carbon market. The TA will follow a \"learning-by-doing\" approach: \nalongside  the  training  activities,  real  CDM  projects  will be  developed  to  demonstrate  best \npractices and guidelines. The TA framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \n11.  The TA will have the following outputs: (i) staff of NCDMA and other relevant central-\nlevel stakeholders, and urban local bodies (and municipalities) in selected states, and project \ndevelopers and promoters trained to assess and evaluate CDM projects using GHG-reducing \ntechnologies such as landfill gas capture, waste to energy, etc.; (ii) two best-practice CDM \nmethodologies  and  PDDs  prepared13  for  these  sectors;  (iii)  an  action  plan  and  strategy \ndocument developed to replicate CDM projects in municipalities and urban local bodies; (iv) two \nbest-practice  CDM  methodologies  and  PDDs  prepared,  and  associated  project  bundling \nmechanisms and financial structuring options formulated (in close cooperation with suitable \nbanks) for selected small-scale CDM sectors such as rural (decentralized) energy supply, small-\nindustry clusters, etc.; (v) an operational toolkit and handbook prepared for small-scale CDM \nprojects; (vi) a CDM project appraisal and risk-management toolkit developed for the domestic \nfinancial and insurance sector; (vii) staff of selected institutions from the financial and insurance \nsectors trained in appraisal, risk management, and structuring of CDM projects; and (viii) the \nfeasibility of a dedicated fund for CDM projects assessed and the fund design developed.  \n \n12.  The capacity-building experience from this TA will be disseminated among stakeholders \nin other DMCs, which face similar challenges in their CDM markets. The outputs of this TA will \nbe made available on ADB's REACH Program Web site (www.adb.org/reach) and NCDMA's \nCDM Web site. The toolkits and handbook will be disseminated to project developers, regulatory \n                                                 \n12 These include the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), United Nations Development Programme, \nWorld Bank, and the governments of Canada and Switzerland. The programs mainly focus on the large-scale \nindustry and forestry. Many bilateral support initiatives have been tied to project CERs being offered exclusively to \nthe funding countries.  \n13 The PDDs prepared under this TA will be ready to be validated by operational entities and thereafter be submitted \nfor approval and registration by the CDM executive board. \n ", "4  \nbodies, and financial and insurance organizations in India and other DMCs through the REACH \nProgram network. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n13.  The TA will be implemented in close coordination with the MoEF and other stakeholders \nand interested parties, including the private sector, financial institutions, insurance companies, \nand civil-society organizations. The TA consultant, in close coordination with MoEF, will select  \nfocus states, municipalities, and financial and insurance organizations. All training workshops \nand seminars will be targeted to focus groups and will include a comprehensive evaluation \nframework to determine their effectiveness. The TA is divided into two components. \n \n14.  Component 1. This will focus on governmental and regulatory entities (NCDMA and \nstakeholders at state, urban local body, municipality, and rural levels) and project developers \nand  promoters.  Four  regional  workshops  will  be  conducted  in  India.  The  capacity-building \napproach will include the development of projects, such as landfill methane gas capture; waste \nto energy; and small-scale activities such as rural decentralized energy supply projects, industry \nclusters, rural energy plantations, etc. The best-practice CDM projects developed under this TA \nwill address risks and costs of institutionalizing various elements of the CDM cycle (additionality, \nbaselines, monitoring and verification modalities, sustainable development objectives, etc.).  \n \n15.  Component 2. This will help mainstream CDM into the domestic financial and insurance \nsector.  The  CDM  project  appraisal  and  risk-management  toolkit  from  this  TA  will  help \nmainstream carbon finance and associated revenue streams into project finance appraisals. \nFour regional training workshops in India will help build capacity of selected financial institutions \n(commercial  banks,  nonbanking  financial  institutions,  rural  cooperative  banks,  etc.)  and \ninsurance companies in the area of CDM. One international seminar on carbon markets and \nfinancing  will  be  organized.14  The  feasibility  of  a  dedicated  fund  for  CDM  projects  will  be \nassessed,  and  its  conceptual  framework,  organizational  structure,  business  plan,  and \noperational guidelines designed.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The total cost of this TA is estimated at $900,000 equivalent, with a foreign exchange \ncost of $425,000 and a local currency cost of $475,000 equivalent. The Government of Canada \nwill provide $700,000, consisting of the entire foreign exchange cost of $425,000 and $275,000 \nequivalent of local currency cost from the Canadian Cooperation Fund for Climate Change. The \nTA will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Canada, and will be administered by \nADB. The Government of India will finance the remaining $200,000 equivalent of local currency \ncosts, in kind. The TA cost estimate and financing plan are in Appendix 2.    \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  MoEF will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA and will provide office space and \nlocal telephone access. The EA will help the TA consultant identify specific counterparts and \nfacilitate data gathering in urban local bodies, municipalities, and rural areas. The TA consultant \n                                                 \n14 At the international seminar, selected participants from other DMCs in the region will be invited to share the lessons \nlearned and best practices developed under this TA and other similar ADB TAs (e.g., ADB. 2004.  Opportunities for \nthe CDM in the Energy Sector. Manila [TA-3840 PRC, also cofinanced by the Government of Canada and \ncompleted in 2004]).  \n ", "  5\nwill organize the workshops and international seminar, which will be designed in coordination \nwith  the  EA  and  other  multilateral  and  bilateral  development  partners.  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented over 18 months, from 1 February 2005 to 31 July 2006.  \n \n18.  A project implementation unit will be located in the office of the EA, which will assign a \nsenior staff member as the project manager and a counterpart team from NCDMA to work with \nthe TA consultant. The project manager will regularly monitor the consultant's work, in close \ncoordination with ADB. The EA will establish a steering committee comprising senior officials \nfrom the Government, and representatives from the NCDMA interministerial committee, private \nsector, and civil-society organizations. The steering committee\u2014the apex body that will convey \nand interpret the Government's views and generally oversee TA implementation\u2014will meet at \nleast  quarterly.  Meeting  minutes  will  be  recorded  and  circulated  to  ADB  and  members  of \nNCDMA. The EA will nominate the project manager and establish the steering committee before \nthe TA consultants are mobilized and fielded. The team leader of the TA consultants will be \nresponsible  for  overall  coordination  between  consultants,  the  Government,  ADB,  and  the \nsteering committee. \n \n19.  The TA will require a consulting team of international and domestic consultants. About \n12 person-months of international and 39 person-months of domestic consulting services are \nenvisaged. The international consultants should have extensive experience in CDM policy, \nregulatory, and market development. They should have demonstrated expertise in areas of (i) \nclimate change policy formulation and international negotiations, (ii) multisector CDM project \ndevelopment and processing, (iii) project-level financial and economic analysis, (iv) institutional \ndevelopment, and (v) financial risk management and fund structuring. International consultants \nwill collaborate with and supplement the skills of domestic consultants, who will have similar \nexpertise and be familiar with Indian conditions and institutional structures. The outline terms of \nreference for consulting services are in Appendix 3. ADB will engage a consulting firm or a \nconsortium of firms in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Consultants will \nbe recruited following the submission of full technical proposals under the quality- and cost-\nbased  selection  method.    Procurement  of  any  equipment  under  the  TA  will  follow  ADB's \nGuidelines on Procurement. \n \n20.  The consultants will submit their inception report (a detailed work program with specific \ntimetable for important tasks), interim report, and a draft final report by the end of month 1, 6, \nand 14, respectively, after their services start. Other deliverable reports will be submitted in \naccordance with milestones to be confirmed when the TA starts. The consultants will prepare \nmonthly status and progress reports for the specific scopes of work. Tripartite meetings among \nrepresentatives from the EA, ADB, and TA consultants will be held in India to discuss the \ninception, interim, and draft final reports. Within 1 month of the tripartite meeting for the draft \nfinal report, the consultants will submit a final report, incorporating comments received from the \nGovernment and ADB.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $700,000 to the Government \nof India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Canada for Capacity Building for \nClean Development Mechanism, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6 Appendix 1 \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK \n \n \nDesign Summary  Performance  Monitoring  Assumptions \nIndicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nGoal \nEfficient reduction of GHGs through  Reduction in rate of growth  Annual statistical reports \nimplementation of CDM projects in India   of GHG emissions at  of NCDMA and MoEF \nnational level and in focal \nstates \n \nSpecific reduction of GHG  UNFCCC's CDM \nemissions in CDM projects   executive board \nstatistics and monitoring \ndata \nPurpose \n  Assumptions \nProvide broad-based institutional  Increased number of CDM  Data from workshop  Stakeholders\u2019 and \ndevelopment, technical, and training  projects developed and  reports on number of  participants\u2019 ability to \nsupport for capacity building of various  implemented, targeting  stakeholders trained in  absorb the skill set \nstakeholders in specific CDM sectors  municipality, urban local  target sectors and  offered by the training \nand selected areas, through a \"learning-  bodies, rural, and small- areas, from NCDMA, \nby-doing\" approach.  scale sectors  state, urban,  Counterpart interest \n  municipality, and rural  and willingness to \n  level entities, and  participate at the \n  financial and insurance  local, municipality, \n  organizations  and rural levels \n \nIncreased number of CDM  NCDMA statistics on   Counterpart interest in \nprojects assessed and  number of PDDs  the financial and \nevaluated by policy and  developed, approved,  insurance sectors \nregulatory institutions in the  and implemented in \nfocal states, at the  target sectors and  Risks \nmunicipality, urban local  states, and their  Lack of adequate \nbody, and rural levels  financing and risk-  participation from \nmitigation sources  financial and \n  insurance sectors  \nIncreased number (and  UNFCCC's CDM   \nshare) of CDM projects in  executive board  Inadequate capacity \ntarget sectors, which are  statistics  to absorb training at \napproved by NCDMA and  the level of all \nCDM executive board and  stakeholders  \nimplemented   \nRegime of low prices \nIncreased number of CDM  being offered for \nprojects appraised,  emissions reduction \nprocessed, and financed by  from CDM projects \ndomestic financial sector \n \nIncreased number of CDM \nprojects where domestic risk \ninsurance sector is involved \nin mitigating project risks \nOutputs     \n      \n1.
