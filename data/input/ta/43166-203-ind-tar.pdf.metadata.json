Introduction  \n \n1.  On 31 August 2009, ADB approved the provision of a Technical Assistance Cluster (C-\nTA) to India for Advanced Project Preparedness for Poverty Reduction to the Government of \nIndia.  The  C-TA  is  financed  on  a  grant  basis  through  the  Department  of  International \nDevelopment (DFID), funded by the Government of the United Kingdom, under the DFID and \nADB Partnership for India, 2009\u20132013. The C-TA is implemented until 31 December 2013 in \ntwo phases:  The first phase (Phase 1), in the amount of $14 million equivalent, covers 17 \ncomponent TA projects with completion by 31 August 2012. The second phase (Phase 2), \napproved through a major change in scope and implementation arrangements by the ADB \nBoard on 4 October 2011, entails an increase of $8 million equivalent and the addition of 9 new \ncomponent TA projects to be completed by 31 December 2013. \n \n2.  The TA component-subproject 17 \u2018Supporting Clean Village Environments for MDGs\u2019 is \nincluded in Phase 2 of the C-TA for 2011. The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  finance \n$600,000 equivalent on a grant basis under the TA Cluster for Advanced Project Preparedness \nfor  Poverty  Reduction,  funded  by  the  Government  of  United  Kingdom  through  DFID.  The \nsubproject was initially requested vide letter to ADB dated 9 February 2011 by the Department \nof Economic Affairs (DEA), Ministry of Finance, through the Ministry of Drinking Water and \nSanitation  (MDWS).  Subsequent  details  of  the  subproject  was  discussed  and  agreed  with \nMDWS through an ADB Mission conducted during 23-26 August 2011.1 \n \nB.  Issues \n \n3.  Despite being one the fastest growing economies, access to adequate sanitation (MDG \n7) remains far lower in India compared to many other countries with similar or lower Gross \nDomestic Product (GDP). Nearly 60% of India\u2019s 1.1 billion people still practice open defecation.2 \nThe problem of poor sanitation is particularly daunting in rural areas, where the vast majority still \n                                                \n1  The Mission comprised Ms. Hayman Win, Social Sector Specialist/Mission Leader, SAHS/ SARD.

", "2 \n \npractices open-defecation as the norm.  The impacts on human health of poor sanitation and \nunhygienic practices are significant, with links to spread of diarrheal diseases and intestinal \ninfections that are among leading causes of malnutrition, illness and death especially among \nIndia\u2019s children (MDGs 1 and 4). It is estimated that one in every ten deaths in India is linked to \npoor sanitation and hygiene, and diarrhea accounts for every twentieth death, mostly among \nchildren  under-five.3  Poor  health  affects  not  only  productive  labor  but  also  regular  school \nattendance among children (MDG 2). Women and girls are especially affected by lack of privacy \nfrom limited access to toilet facilities in schools and households. According to a study by the \nWater and Sanitation Program (WSP), the economic tolls of inadequate sanitation in India \naccounted  for  about  6.4%  of  GDP  in  the  year  2006,  mostly  from  adverse  health-related \nimpacts.4 \n \n4.  India recognizes that its sanitation problems lie not just on the lack of facilities or funding \nbut on peoples\u2019 traditional attitudes and behavior. Beginning 1999, the GOI restructured its \nCentral Rural Sanitation Program (CRSP) with a paradigm shift in approach to people-centered \nand community-led total sanitation under banner of Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC). Despite \nthe  huge  investments  made  by  GOI  for  the  flagship  program,  and  impressive  successes \nattained  in  many  states,  the  results  have  generally  not  been  commensurate  with  GOI\u2019s \nexpectations. There are significant disparities among states and districts and also slippages \nonce villages attain open defection free (ODF) status. At the present rate of coverage, it is \nexpected that ODF India will be reached only by 2017 at the national level, while sustainability \nmay still remain an issue.  GOI recognizes that for sustainable rural sanitation and for the \nprogram  to  gain  full  momentum,  innovative  programmatic  solutions  are  needed  to  bridge \nfollowing gaps in TSC implementation:  \n \ni.  Access. Current toilet coverage in rural areas is only about 30% of households. To \naccelerate coverage, commensurate with population increases, there is a need to \nfurther explore and scale-up affordable, appropriate household sanitation options. \n \nii.  Quality and usage. Poor quality of existing toilets also often ends up in their disuse \nor misuse. There is a need for expanding household financing options for building \nhigher quality toilets and scaling up supply chain and services in toilet construction \nand maintenance.  \n \niii.  Behavior change. Open-defecation in rural areas continues to be a socially and \nculturally accepted behavior at large. Large-scale and consistent efforts are still \nneeded to create and sustain community demand for hygiene and sanitation.  \n \niv.  Poverty and targeting. The Government provides incentives to below-poverty line \n(BPL) households, but studies show that uptake of toilets among the poor is still \ndrastically low. There is a need to evolve strategies and review incentive structures \nto motivate both BPL, as well as those above the poverty line (APL) with low uptake, \nto construct and use toilets.

Integrating total sanitation.  While the present focus is largely on creating open \ndefecation free (ODF) communities, there is need to also explore and scale-up \ninnovations in effective solid and liquid waste management for rural communities.  \n \nvii.  Enabling  environment.   There  is  a  need  to  review  and  systematically  support \nenabling environment for effective program implementation at all levels, including \nleadership and advocacy, administrative capacities, provisions for monitoring and \nsupervision, and cross-sector coordination across relevant programs. \n \n5.  External assistance. Sanitation in rural areas has received relatively little focus from \nexternal agencies and private sector compared to in urban areas. Despite the scale of need in \nrural areas for innovations and effective approaches, there are only a handful of development \npartners working in the field. Although a multitude of very good assessments, surveys, and \npilots have taken place, there is a lack of systematic coordination and forum for knowledge \nsharing among key players in rural sanitation, which have hampered comprehensive diagnostics \nand programmatic solutions to addressing the broad challenges around TSC implementation. \n \n6.  Government Strategy. The MDWS recently promulgated the Ten Year Rural Sanitation \nand Hygiene Strategy (2012-2022).5 Aligning with the Government Planning Commission\u2019s next \n12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017), the MDWS plans to incrementally shift from the present \nproject-based approach of TSC to a more comprehensive National Total Sanitation Mission \n(NTSM).6  However,  the  operational  modality,  supporting  structures,  and  other  practical \nimplementation  aspects  of  NTSM  need  to  be  further  developed  and  refined.  Effective \noperational tools and models in rural sanitation, especially for lagging states, need to be further \nsought based on TSC implementation experience, as well as global and regional best practices. \nThus, the need for the component TA was identified to enhance knowledge and capacity of \nMWDS to assess program support and adjustment requirements for strengthening the execution \nof the TSC, and to help design the program\u2019s evolution to NTSM as envisaged under the long-\nterm Rural Sanitation and Hygiene Strategy. The TA is also required to assist MWDS and \nselected state and local governments in assessing effective and scalable operational models in \nselected areas of TSC and the MDWS long-term Strategy.7  \n \nC.  The Proposed TA Cluster Subproject  \n \n1.  Impact and Outcome \n \n                                                \n5  The Strategy adopts a phased approach to implementation with three time-bound goals: (i) end of open defecation \nby 2017; (ii) sustained behavior change and communities\u2019 adoption safe hygiene practices by 2020; and (iii) \neffective management of solid and liquid waste management in rural areas by 2022. The long-term strategy is \nroughly costed at Rs. 47,665 crores (about US$10.4 billion). \n6  The 10-Year Rural Sanitation and Hygiene Strategy (2012-2022) shows the evolution of GoI program framework on \nrural sanitation, including comparison on basic strategy and elements of Central Rural Sanitation Program (1986-\n99), Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) (1999-present), and the planned NTSM (2012-2022). \n7  The  scope  of  the  subproject  assistance  is  national,  as  it  will  primarily  benefit  MDWS  with  strengthening \nimplementation of a national program (i.e. Total Sanitation Campaign). However, lessons will be drawn from \nexperiences and pilot implementation in selected states (indicatively Bihar, Orissa, Uttar Pradesh, Assam), which \nwill also directly benefit them. \n \n ", "4 \n \n7.  Through its support for improved sanitation and clean village environments, the impact \nof the subproject will contribute to India achieving targets related to MDG 4 (child mortality) and \nMDG 7 (environmental sustainability). The subproject outcome will be increased knowledge and \ncapacity of MWDS and state and local government officials to strengthen implementation of \nTSC. The subproject design and monitoring framework (DMF) is shown in Appendix 1. \n \n2.  Methodology and Key Activities.  \n \na.  Component 1: Operations Diagnostics  \n \n8.  Building on analysis of existing relevant assessments, surveys, and pilots by various \nagencies, a rapid assessment will be carried out of TSC implementation experiences at state \nand local government level in 3 selected states.8 This includes review of TSC strategy and \nprocesses,  governance  and  institutional  structures,  technology  options,  financing  and \nincentives,  monitoring  and  supervision  mechanisms,  entrepreneurial  capacity,  and \ncomprehensive  capacity  development  needs  on  both  supply  and  demand-creation  sides. \nAnalysis of social and gender dimensions and roles and impacts related to sanitation will be \nincluded in the assessments. This conduct of the assessments will build on close coordination \nand collaboration with other development partners and stakeholders. \n \nb.  Component 2: Tools and Pilots  \n \n9.  Based  on  findings  of  the  above  diagnostics,  socially  and  locally  responsive  tools, \nmodels, and/or processes related to key relevant areas of TSC and the MDWS long-term \nSanitation Strategy will be developed.9 These may relate to (i) supply chain: technology options, \nbusiness models to ensure adequate supply chain and services, and approaches to catalyze \nprivate entrepreneurial capacity in rural sanitation; (ii) demand-creation: elements of a strategic \nprogram for behavior change with consistent messages, including focus on women and children \nas change agents; and (iii) enabling environment: recommendations on monitoring system, \nincentive structures, financing options, and building local administrative capacities (including \nPanchayati Raj Institutions10), and exploring innovative uses of Information, Communication and \nTechnology (ICT). The development of tool-kits and materials would be tailored to address any \ngender differences in the behavior of males and females specific to sanitation. \n \n10.  The aforementioned tools and approaches will be selectively piloted in at least 2 districts \nof different geographical areas11 to test their applicability to local contexts, and for further \nrefinement. Sound monitoring and evaluation would be incorporated in the design of the pilot \nprojects to demonstrate results. In addition to existing TSC monitoring structures and available \nsecondary  sources,  supplementary  baseline  and  end-line  assessments  will  be  included  in \ndeveloping the pilot projects to assess changes in areas of key interest. \n \nc.  Component 3: Plan of Operations to Strengthen TSC Implementation  \n \n                                                \n8 The 3 selected states for rapid assessment will be confirmed at inception stage in consultation with stakeholders. \nThese would include lagging, as well as well-performing (indicatively Gujarat), states for comparison. \n9  The indicative areas for tools development and pilot implementation will be confirmed following the diagnostics and \nassessment of complementarities and comparative advantages with other partners.  \n10 Panchayati Raj Institutions or PRIs comprise a system of local governance in which the Gram Panchayat is the \nbasic unit of administration.  It has 3 levels: village, block and district.  \n11  Pilots will be confirmed at inception stage, and building on findings of component 1. Potential states discussed with \nMWDS are Orissa, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Assam.  \n ", "5 \n \n11.  With  experience  from  the  assessments  and  piloted  interventions,  a  report  will  be \nprepared for MWDS on plan of operations or recommendations to bridge implementation gaps \nat national TSC program level and/ or state levels to scale-up and strengthen India\u2019s rural \nsanitation agenda. The report will also include program support and adjustment requirements to \nsupport the MDWS with the shift to NTSM over the next 5-10 years. A national-level workshop \nwill be organized to share and agree on  acceptability of the report\u2019s recommendations to \nstakeholders, as well as to support TSC policy enhancement. The workshop will also serve as \nplatform for sharing best practices in state and local level TSC implementation. \n \n3.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  ADB will provide technical assistance in the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis \nfrom the Government of the United Kingdom financing through DFID, under the C-TA Advanced \nProject  Preparedness  for  Poverty  Reduction,  administered  by  ADB.  The  Government  will \nprovide contributions in-kind through parallel support from TSC funds for pilot implementation, \nsupplementary  research,  data  collection  services,  meetings,  counterpart  staff,  and  office \naccommodation and transport. Appendix 2 summarizes the cost estimated and financing plan. \nDisbursements under the TA will be made in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (May 2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n4.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The Department of Drinking Water and Sanitation (DWS), MDWS, will be the executing \nagency for the TA subproject. The TA will be guided by a small committee of 4 to 6 local experts \nand stakeholders, chaired by the Joint Secretary, DWS, with regular reporting to the Secretary, \nMDWS.  The  Joint  Secretary,  DWS  will  be  the  focal  person  to  select  and  invite  key \nknowledgeable persons in the country to participate in the committee and its working-group \nsessions  to  vet  findings  at  key  stages  of  subproject.  The  EA  and  ADB  will  review \nimplementation  progress  at  six  month  intervals  at  mutually  agreed  time  and  venue.  The \nsubproject will provide semi-annual inputs to the C-TA project officer at the ADB India Resident \nMission  (INRM)  and  will  receive  additional  guidance  as  needed  from  the  joint  cluster  TA \nadvisory committee (JTAC), chaired by Joint Secretary, DEA and Country Director, INRM. \n \n14.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 18 months including initial months for start-\nup and consultant mobilization. Consultancy inputs will be a mix of international and national \nexperts, dovetailing national and international experiences, and adding a new perspective to \naddressing challenges around rural sanitation in India. The following consultancies totaling 6 \ninternational person-months and 22 national person-months are envisaged: (i) Team Leader/ \nSanitation  Expert  (international,  6  person  months,  intermittent);  (ii)  Deputy  Team  Leader/ \nSanitation Expert (national, 11 person months, intermittent); (iii) Local Governance/ Institutional \nExpert (national, 3 person months, intermittent); (iv) Capacity Development Expert (national, 3 \nperson  months,  intermittent);  (v)  Behavior  Change  Expert  (national,  2  person  months, \nintermittent); and (vi) Private Sector/ PPP Expert (national, 3 person months, intermittent). ADB \nwill engage the consultants through an international firm,12 using Quality-Cost Based Selection \n(QCBS) method with 80:20 weighting, and Simplified Technical Proposal (STP), in accordance \nwith ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). All \n                                                \n12 From consultations, the Mission believes the pool of highly-qualified consultants for the role of Team Leader on \nrural sanitation issues may be limited nationally, especially as DWS is seeking new perspectives on the issues. \nEngagement of an international firm/ think-tank would also allow the TA to tap institutional technical knowledge on \nsanitation.  \n ", "6 \n \nnecessary procurement will be done in accordance with ADB's Procurement Guidelines (2010, \nas amended from time to time), and handed over to the EA upon TA completion. The outline \nterms of reference for consultancy requirements under the TA is in Appendix 3. Consultants will \nwork under the day-to-day guidance of Director, DWS and under the overall guidance of the Joint \nSecretary, DWS. Limited office accommodation and work space for consultants will be provided \nat the MWDS based on availability.  \n \nD.  Recommendation \n \n15.  Relevant  department/  offices  have  been  consulted  and  comments  received  were \nincorporated as appropriate (see Attachment 3). \n \n16.  Pursuant to para. 27 of OM Section D12/OP, and para. 19 of the C-TA0003 paper, your \napproval  is  requested  for  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  Cluster  TA  Subproject  on \n\u2018Supporting Clean Village Environments for MDGs\u2019 in an amount of $600,000 equivalent to be \nfinanced under the TA Cluster for Advanced Project Preparedness for Poverty Reduction, on a \ngrant basis, from the Department of International Development, funded by the Government of \nUnited Kingdom. \n \n17.
