At the request of His Majesty's Government of Nepal and in support of Bank and other\nexternal assistance to develop adequate and sustainable water supplies, this technical assistance\n(TA) has been prepared for the formulation and implementation of urban water supply reforms in\nKathmandu Valley.1 A Bank mission undertook fact-finding for the TA from 24 November to 10\nDecember 1997. The Mission held discussions with representatives of the Government, external aid\nagencies, and other stakeholders including beneficiaries and nongovernment organizations (NGOs),\nand reached an understanding with the Government on the objectives, scope, cost estimates,\nfinancing plan, and implementation arrangements for the TA.2\nII.\t BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2. Nepal, with its more than 6,000 rivers flowing over 45,000 kilometers (km) is endowed\nwith one of the world's largest per capita supplies of water resources (11,200 cubic meters [rn 3] per\nannum). Entirely located within the Ganges Basin, but accounting for only 13.2 percent of the\nBasin's vast area, Nepal contributes 41 percent of the total runoff of the Ganges Basin and 71\npercent of its dry season flow. Nepal's economically viable power potential is estimated at 41,000\nmegawatts (MW). However, less than 1 percent of the economic potential has been developed, and\npower shortages have been common over the last decade. Of about 1.8 million hectares of land with\npotential for irrigation, 1.1 million hectares have been developed, although only 35 percent of\nirrigated areas receive water year-round due to seasonality of supply. Overall 61 percent of the\nnation's population has access to some form of water supply system. Although the target was for 72\npercent of the population to have access by 1997, recent estimates indicate that only 60 percent of\nthe rural and 67 percent of the urban population is adequately covered. The seasonality of river\nflows, particularly in Kathmandu Valley, has continued to impede the availability of safe and reliable\nwater supplies, and economic and population growth has resulted in the overexploitation and\npollution of surface and groundwater sources. Only recently (in 1994) has the Government taken\nsteps to integrate all water resources development in Nepal, with the formation of a National Water\nResources Development Council. The National Water Resources Strategy Study, commenced in\n1996 under World Bank assistance, is currently about to enter its second phase: recommending\nactions.\n3. There are two major institutions operating in the water supply sector in Nepal. The\nDepartment of Water Supply and Sewerage (DWSS) is responsible for rural and small town water supply\nand sanitation. The Nepal Water Supply Corporation (NWSC) is responsible for larger urban water\nsupplies and sewerage, including those for the capital city, Kathmandu. DWSS is performing well in\ndevelopment and as a facilitator of community water supply management However, NWSC has not been\neffective in managing urban water supplies due to a lack of autonomy, lack of staff motivation, lack of\npublic awareness about water use, and lack of sufficient revenues from tariffs to maintain the existing\nsystem and become financially viable. As a condition for future financial support in urban water supplies\nby the Bank and the World Bank, the Government agreed in 1997 to introduce private sector\nmanagement of the urban water supplies within Kathmandu Valley. The terms and conditions of a private\nsector management contract are currently under preparation with World Bank assistance. 4 One\ncomponent of this TA will provide the necessary public awareness and policy and regulatory framework to\nsupport the private sector management contract. This support has been formulated in close cooperation\nwith the World Bank.\nA Bank-funded engineering loan is also being prepared for the Melamchi Water Supply Project, which will provide\n170,000 cubic meters per day of water for Kathmandu Valley.\n2\t The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in November 1 997.\nKathmandu Municipality is responsible for drainage within Kathmandu City.\nThe contract is expected to be let alter competitive bidding, for an initial period of 5-8 years, and will probably include a\nfixed fee to cover costs plus a fee based on the contractors performance against agreed upon efficiency criteria.", "2\n4. Kathmandu Valley is home to about 1.3 million people mostly living in urban\nenvironments, of which Kathmandu (population 800000) is the largest. The water supply situation in\nKathmandu Valley is critical, especially during the dry season, when most households receive water\nfor only 1-2 hours per day, and many people have to rely on small quantities of water brought by\ntankers. Rapid urbanization is occurring, with an annual growth rate of about 4.5 percent in\nKathmandu, yet the prospect of significant relief from this situation (with the commissioning of the\nproposed Melamchi Water Supply Project) is 5-6 years away.\n5. Water supplies to Kathmandu Valley are a combination of both surface water and\ngroundwater. Surface water supplies are inadequate due to deforestation and the sharp seasonality of\nrainfall and runoff. Rivers in Kathmandu Valley become nothing more than open sewers in the dry\nseason, due to inadequate sewerage and wastewater management.\n6. Groundwater in Kathmandu Valley is being mined both by the private sector and\nNWSC for the public supplies, and there is little potential for increasing extraction. Due to a number\nof clay layers between the surface and the aquifer, the natural recharge of this groundwater is so\nslow that it scarcely makes any difference to the future potential groundwater supplies. On the other\nhand, the private sector (carpet industries in particular) exploit the groundwater free of charge. No\none knows for sure how much water is being extracted, how quickly the groundwater level is falling, or\nhow the groundwater quality is being affected, because no financial resources, human resources, nor\ninstitutional responsibility have been devoted to monitoring groundwater.\n7. Water resources management in Kathmandu Valley will need to be based on an\nintegrated and sustainable regimen involving (I) rehabilitation of water supply distribution to reduce losses\n(current World Bank-funded project), (ii) additional surface water supplies (the Melamchi Water Supply\nProject), (iii) artificial recharge of groundwater (to be investigated under a Bank-funded engineering loan\nfor the Melamchi Water Supply Project), (iv) licensing and control of groundwater (under this TA), (v)\nprivate sector management of water supply delivery (to be provided through the World Bank) and (vi)\nwastewater management (planning under this TA).\n8. The National Water Supply Policy recently developed for Nepal spells out urban and rural\nwater supply policy in general terms. This TA will build on that policy and prepare a specific urban water\nsupply policy document with particular relevance to Kathmandu Valley and its exceptional situation vis-a-\nvis private sector management.\n9. Since 1984 the Bank has provided four loans totaling $64 million equivalent to the\nrural water supply and sanitation sector, and these have been more and more successful,\nparticularly in terms of community management. The Bank's first investment in the urban water\nsupply sector in Nepal is proposed for the Melanichi Water Supply Project. The Bank is also\nproviding ongoing assistance for Kathmandu urban development.1\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n10. This TA is first to prepare for and support the private sector management of piped\nwater supplies in Kathmandu Valley, and second to enhance the sustainable development and\nmanagement of water resources within the Valley. These reforms will be formulated and\nLoan No. 1240-NEP(SF):Kathmandu Urban Development, br $12.0 million equivalent, approved on 29 June\n1993.", "3\nimplemented to be compatible with the findings of the National Water Resources Strategy Study. A\nTA framework is provided in Appendix 1.\nB.\t Scope\n11. Urban water supply policy in Kathmandu Valley will be formulated within the overall\ncontext of the National Water Supply Policy. It will (i) define levels of service and equitability\nrequirements based on population density and land use planning; (ii) define minimum requirements\nfor water resource management in terms of water metering, water losses, and water conservation\nthrough demand management; (iii) set operational performance criteria for the water utility; (iv)\naddress service to the urban poor who live in slums or squatter settlements; (v) stipulate public\nawareness requirements; (vi) provide coverage targets; (vii) define policy on 24-hour supply of water;\nand (viii) ensure that financial management is in accordance with the cost recovery and tariff\npolicies.\n12. Appropriate cost recovery and tariff policies will be developed, and the TA will help in\nthe early stages of implementation. The policies will cover surface water and groundwater use. They\nwill address the funding terms, the operation and maintenance (O&M) cost recovery, debt-service\ncost recovery, and contributions to capital investment. An appropriate definition of O&M will be\nprovided. The mechanism for revision of tariffs will be spelled out. All types of subsidies will be\ndefined as to their objective, who will benefit, and what schedule is proposed for phasing them out.\n13. A regulatory framework will be created to monitor and control water supply and\nwastewater tariffs, and the private sector management of urban water supplies within Kathmandu\nValley. The indicators under which the performance of the private sector contractor can be\nevaluated will be clearly established.\n14. The wastewater management plan for Kathmandu Valley (originally prepared in 1988)\nwill be reviewed and updated after consultation with concerned stakeholders. This will be approved\nfor implementation by the appropriate city and Government authorities. It will cover institutional\ndevelopment, legislation, water pollution control, sewerage and sewage treatment, land use\nplanning, industrial effluent treatment, and water reuse. Potential funding for implementation of the\nplan will be identified.\n15. A public awareness campaign will be prepared and implemented. It will include special\nattention on water conservation, hygiene education, and the understanding of tariffs. A variety of\nmedia will be used to ensure maximum coverage of all potential consumers.\n16. Groundwater licensing will be introduced in Kathmandu Valley for all bores using\nmotor-driven pumps. Groundwater extraction charges for private users will be legislated and then\nimplemented. These funds will be set aside for the future artificial recharge of groundwater. The\nproposed new regulatory authority will determine tariffs based on an agreed upon Government\npolicy.\n17. Groundwater monitoring will be introduced in Kathmandu Valley. This will cover water\nlevels, water extraction rates, and water quality. Institutional reforms will ensure that the proposed\nprogram of groundwater monitoring receives the necessary human and financial resources to be\nsustained in the long term.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n18. The estimated cost of the TA is $1.0 million equivalent comprising a foreign exchange\ncost of $600,000 and a local currency cost of $400,000 equivalent. The Bank will finance the", "4\nequivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of\nJapan, and the Government will finance the equivalent of $200,000. Of the Bank's contribution,\napproximately $660,000 equivalent will be for consultant inputs, and the remainder for surveys,\ntransport, office equipment, and communications. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan\nare given in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n19. The Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning. The\nProject Director has already been appointed. The international and domestic consultants will be\nsupported by at least ten professionally qualified Government counterparts in the fields of\ngroundwater engineering, financial accounting, water supply engineering, administration, sanitary\nengineering, sociology, hygiene education, and workshop facilitation. Public hearings and workshops\nwill be conducted for concerned stakeholders to express their views about draft proposals for the\nlicensing and charging for groundwater, tariff policy, the regulatory framework for private sector\nmanagement, and water and wastewater tariffs. NGOs will be involved in the preparation and\nimplementation of the public awareness campaign.\n20. The TA will start in June 1998 and finish in December 1999. The consultants will\nproduce an inception report in July 1998; interim reports in September 1998, December 1998, and\nJune 1999; and a completion report in December 1999. Monthly progress reports will also be\nprovided beginning in August 1998. At the consultant contract negotiations a schedule for\nparticipatory workshops will be agreed upon.\n21. A total of 18 person-months of international consulting services is proposed consisting\nof a hydrogeologist (2 person-months), a financial analyst (6 person-months), a water supply\nengineer (3 person-months), a private sector regulator (4 person-months), and a wastewater/sanitary\nengineer (3 person-months). Inputs from domestic consultants, totaling 38 person-months, include a\nfinancial analyst (6 person-months), a water supply engineer (20 person-months), a sanitary\nengineer (6 person-months), and a hydrogeologist (6 person-months). The outline terms of\nreference for the consulting services are provided in Appendix 3. The consultants will be recruited in\naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Most of the consultant inputs will\nbe required before the end of 1998, but intermittent inputs will continue until the end of 1999. The\nteam leader of the consultants is envisaged to be the international financial analyst. The domestic\nwater supply engineer will be the deputy team leader.\n22. The Government will provide appropriate furnished accommodation. Other\nGovernment contributions to the Project will comprise (I) per diems and remuneration for counterpart\nstaff, (ii) socioeconomic surveys and organization of public hearings and workshops, (iii) water\nquality testing and river flow monitoring, (iv) survey and registration of private groundwater extraction\nin Kathmandu Valley, and (v) implementation of a public awareness campaign through various\nmedia including NGOs.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n23. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to His Majesty's Government of Nepal in an\namount not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 for the purpose of Urban Water Supply Reforms\nin Kathmandu Valley, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "Appendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDESIGN SUMMARY\t PROJECT TARGETS\t MONITORING MECHANISMS ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS\nSectorlArea Goals\n1.Sustainable water\t Institutional responsibility Annual report of Water and\t Liaison with Bank\nresource management for KV water resources\t Energy Commission Secretariat\t engineering loan (Melamchi)\n2.Piped water supplies in management\nKathmandu Valley\t Annual report of water utility\t World Bank continued\nMelamchi Water Supply\t support to urban water supply\nProject implementation\t rehabilitation and private\nsector management\nPrivate sector\nmanagement of\t Government commitment to\nKathmandu Valley water\t reforms\nsupply_________________________________ _____________________________\nPurpose\n1.Create foundation for\t Private sector\t Water utility performance\t Government commitment to\nprivate sector\t management contract\t parameters monitored by\t reforms\nmanagement of KV\t awarded by February\t regulator\nwater supply\t 1999\t Good progress by World\nBank-funded consultants for\n2.Plan for control of GW Institutional responsibility Groundwater and wastewater\t private sector management\nand wastewater in KV\t for GW and wastewater quarterly monitoring reports\nmonitoring in KV with\t (NWSC)\nappropriate budget\n________________________ allocation\t ______________________________ __________________________\nComponents\n1.Urban water supply\t By Sep 1998 regulatory\t Bank mission BTORs and\t Project director remains in\npolicy\t framework, tariff, and\t project director correspondence\t place for duration of TA\ncost recovery policies to\n2.Cost recovery & tariff\t be endorsed by the\t Consultant competency\npolicy\t Government\t demonstrated\n3.Regulatory framework\t By Feb 1999\ngroundwater monitoring\n4.Wastewater\t and groundwater\nmanagement plan\t licensing introduced and\nregulatory framework\n5.Public awareness\t established\ncampaign\nBy Nov 1999 wastewater\n6.Groundwater licensing plan and urban water\nsupply sector policy\n7.Groundwater\t endorsed by the\nmonitoring\t Government, and public\nawareness campaign\ncompleted\n(Reference in text: page 2, para. 10)", "Appendix 1 page 2\nDESIGN SUMMARY\t PROJECT TARGETS\t MONITORING\t ASSUMPTIONS\n_________________ _____________________________ MECHANISMS\t AND RISKS\nActivities\n1.Hold public hearings $800000 equivalent financing by Bank\t Consultant monthly Timely\nand workshops with\t progress reports as consultant\nstakeholders for\t well as interim\t recruitment\npreparation of policy\t reports:\t and timely\nand regulatory\t July 1998\t implementation\nframework\t September 1998\t of consultant\nDecember 1998\t inputs\nJune 1999\nNovember 1999\n2.

General\n1. The consultants are expected to liaise closely with those for the Melamchi\nWater Supply Project and the World Bank-funded Private Sector Management Contract\nPreparation. Timing of the sector reforms is critical to both the proposed investments\nas well as operational changes for water supplies within Kathmandu Valley. The\nreforms are to be developed through a participatory and consultative process involving\nworkshops for stakeholders, public hearings, and a public awareness program.\nB. Urban Water Supply Policy\n\t2.\t The policy to be formulated will be unique to the Kathmandu Valley but will be\nincorporated within the National Water Supply Policy. The consultants will address:\n(i) urban water supply within the context of comprehensive water resource\nmanagement,\n(ii) institutional and sector administration responsibilities,\n(iii) operation and maintenance including unaccounted-for water reduction and\nother performance indicators,\n(iv) levels of service including those to the urban poor,\n(v) capital investment mechanisms and development plans,\n(vi) private sector participation,\n(vii) subsidies and cost recovery objectives,\n(viii) human resources development, and\n(ix) public awareness and hygiene education.\nC. Financial AnalysislCost Recovery/Tariff Policy\n3.\t The consultants will undertake the following tasks.\n(i) Review the past five years financial performance of the Nepal Water\nSupply Corporation (NWSC); describe sources of funding and terms of\nfunding made available to the sector and to NWSC, and comment on\ncompliance with World Bank covenants, level of cost recovery, adequacy\nof current levels of tariffs to meet operation and maintenance costs, debt\nservicing, and contributions to capital investment financing.\n(ii) Calculate the cost of water supply in economic and financial prices,\naverage incremental economic cost, and average incremental financial\ncost; comment on their appropriateness for guiding current and future\n(Reference in text: page 4, para. 21)", "Appendix 3, page 2\n10\ntariff policy and tariff structures; quantify current subsidies, determining\nwhom they benefit and a schedule for phasing them out.\n(iii) Review existing tariff policies and tariff structures for the urban water\nsupply sector in Kathmandu Valley; examine and comment on existing\neconomic, financial, social, and environmental policies used to formulate\ntariff policies and structures.\n(iv) Review institutional, regulatory, and legal frameworks in which tariff\npolicies and tariff structures are formulated and revise.\n(v) Develop cost recovery policies for water and wastewater services that\nallow proper levels of operation and maintenance, debt service, and a\nproportion of the sector's future capital expenditure to be met; on the\nbasis of cost recovery policies, formulate financial objectives for NWSC.\n(vi) Develop a licensing and tariff structure to be established for private\ngroundwater extraction that reflects the opportunity cost of water and\nNWSC water tariffs.\n(vii) Formulate onlending policies for project financing for both foreign and\nlocal sources.\n(viii) Make recommendations on the performance indicators necessary to\ndetermine technical and financial performance and incentive/\nremuneration structures applicable to a private sector management-type\ncontract.\nD.\t Regulatory Framework\n4. The objective is to provide a regulatory function for water tariffs including\ngroundwater extraction, water quality and service levels, wastewater pollution control, and\nprivate sector management of water supplies. For this purpose, it will be necessary to\nidentify precisely what will be regulated, when and by whom it will be done, and what\nresources are needed. Operational budgets will be prepared for each regulatory function. A\nphased approach is envisaged, whereby only simple regulation is introduced at the start,\nbut more comprehensive regulation follows with time. Appropriate performance indicators\nwill be identified and, to the extent possible, measured for benchmarking purposes. Short-,\nmedium-, and long-term performance targets will be defined. Considerable liaison and\ncoordination with other consultants, agencies, and concerned stakeholders will be required.\nE. Public Awareness Campaign\n5. The objective of this campaign is to provide transparency and understanding of\nthe sector and its reforms to the public in general and concerned stakeholders in particular.\nThe campaign will be designed to be sustainable in the long term and thus institutionalized.\nIt will address tariffs, water conservation, water pollution, and hygiene education and will\nrelate these to ongoing development plans and operations. Special attention will be given to\nschool programs and to utilizing all types of media for conveying the messages to the\npeople. The design and implementation of the campaign will be based on a participatory\napproach.", "Appendix 3, page 3\n11\nF. Groundwater Monitoring and Licensing\n6.\t The consultants will:\n(i) ascertain the extent of groundwater extraction through a comprehensive\nregistration survey of all groundwater use in Kathmandu Valley;\n(ii) design a system for accurate monitoring of groundwater levels, groundwater\nquality, and groundwater extraction volumes using existing and new bores;\n(iii) identify major groundwater users and introduce measurement of water\nextracted;\n(iv) procure and install all necessary monitoring equipment, making due\nprovision for repairs and breakdowns;\n(v) set up a simple computerized database and mapping system for\ngroundwater monitoring;\n(vi) marshal sufficient human and financial resources for continued groundwater\nmonitoring;\n(vii) through legislation and supported by the regulatory framework, introduce\nappropriate licensing and charging for groundwater use; and\n(viii) train the nominated personnel for future monitoring of groundwater and for\npreparation of annual groundwater monitoring reports.\nG. Wastewater Management Plan\n7. The consultants will review the wastewater management plan that was\nprepared in 1988 for Kathmandu Valley. They will investigate what has been implemented\nand what has not, and will determine what were the implementation constraints. New water\nquality data will be collected over a period of 12 months, and new developments affecting\nwastewater management will be identified. The consultants will update the master plan in a\nbrief report and prepare a priority list of investments and regulatory controls needed to\nimprove wastewater management in the Kathmandu Valley.

Rapid urbanization is occurring, with an annual growth rate of about 4.5 percent in\nKathmandu, yet the prospect of significant relief from this situation (with the commissioning of the\nproposed Melamchi Water Supply Project) is 5-6 years away.\n5. Water supplies to Kathmandu Valley are a combination of both surface water and\ngroundwater. Surface water supplies are inadequate due to deforestation and the sharp seasonality of\nrainfall and runoff. Rivers in Kathmandu Valley become nothing more than open sewers in the dry\nseason, due to inadequate sewerage and wastewater management.\n6. Groundwater in Kathmandu Valley is being mined both by the private sector and\nNWSC for the public supplies, and there is little potential for increasing extraction. Due to a number\nof clay layers between the surface and the aquifer, the natural recharge of this groundwater is so\nslow that it scarcely makes any difference to the future potential groundwater supplies. On the other\nhand, the private sector (carpet industries in particular) exploit the groundwater free of charge. No\none knows for sure how much water is being extracted, how quickly the groundwater level is falling, or\nhow the groundwater quality is being affected, because no financial resources, human resources, nor\ninstitutional responsibility have been devoted to monitoring groundwater.\n7. Water resources management in Kathmandu Valley will need to be based on an\nintegrated and sustainable regimen involving (I) rehabilitation of water supply distribution to reduce losses\n(current World Bank-funded project), (ii) additional surface water supplies (the Melamchi Water Supply\nProject), (iii) artificial recharge of groundwater (to be investigated under a Bank-funded engineering loan\nfor the Melamchi Water Supply Project), (iv) licensing and control of groundwater (under this TA), (v)\nprivate sector management of water supply delivery (to be provided through the World Bank) and (vi)\nwastewater management (planning under this TA).\n8. The National Water Supply Policy recently developed for Nepal spells out urban and rural\nwater supply policy in general terms. This TA will build on that policy and prepare a specific urban water\nsupply policy document with particular relevance to Kathmandu Valley and its exceptional situation vis-a-\nvis private sector management.\n9. Since 1984 the Bank has provided four loans totaling $64 million equivalent to the\nrural water supply and sanitation sector, and these have been more and more successful,\nparticularly in terms of community management. The Bank's first investment in the urban water\nsupply sector in Nepal is proposed for the Melanichi Water Supply Project. The Bank is also\nproviding ongoing assistance for Kathmandu urban development.1\nIII.\t THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA.\t Objective\n10. This TA is first to prepare for and support the private sector management of piped\nwater supplies in Kathmandu Valley, and second to enhance the sustainable development and\nmanagement of water resources within the Valley. These reforms will be formulated and\nLoan No. 1240-NEP(SF):Kathmandu Urban Development, br $12.0 million equivalent, approved on 29 June\n1993.", "3\nimplemented to be compatible with the findings of the National Water Resources Strategy Study. A\nTA framework is provided in Appendix 1.\nB.\t Scope\n11. Urban water supply policy in Kathmandu Valley will be formulated within the overall\ncontext of the National Water Supply Policy. It will (i) define levels of service and equitability\nrequirements based on population density and land use planning; (ii) define minimum requirements\nfor water resource management in terms of water metering, water losses, and water conservation\nthrough demand management; (iii) set operational performance criteria for the water utility; (iv)\naddress service to the urban poor who live in slums or squatter settlements; (v) stipulate public\nawareness requirements; (vi) provide coverage targets; (vii) define policy on 24-hour supply of water;\nand (viii) ensure that financial management is in accordance with the cost recovery and tariff\npolicies.\n12. Appropriate cost recovery and tariff policies will be developed, and the TA will help in\nthe early stages of implementation. The policies will cover surface water and groundwater use. They\nwill address the funding terms, the operation and maintenance (O&M) cost recovery, debt-service\ncost recovery, and contributions to capital investment. An appropriate definition of O&M will be\nprovided. The mechanism for revision of tariffs will be spelled out. All types of subsidies will be\ndefined as to their objective, who will benefit, and what schedule is proposed for phasing them out.\n13. A regulatory framework will be created to monitor and control water supply and\nwastewater tariffs, and the private sector management of urban water supplies within Kathmandu\nValley. The indicators under which the performance of the private sector contractor can be\nevaluated will be clearly established.\n14. The wastewater management plan for Kathmandu Valley (originally prepared in 1988)\nwill be reviewed and updated after consultation with concerned stakeholders. This will be approved\nfor implementation by the appropriate city and Government authorities. It will cover institutional\ndevelopment, legislation, water pollution control, sewerage and sewage treatment, land use\nplanning, industrial effluent treatment, and water reuse. Potential funding for implementation of the\nplan will be identified.\n15. A public awareness campaign will be prepared and implemented. It will include special\nattention on water conservation, hygiene education, and the understanding of tariffs. A variety of\nmedia will be used to ensure maximum coverage of all potential consumers.\n16. Groundwater licensing will be introduced in Kathmandu Valley for all bores using\nmotor-driven pumps. Groundwater extraction charges for private users will be legislated and then\nimplemented. These funds will be set aside for the future artificial recharge of groundwater. The\nproposed new regulatory authority will determine tariffs based on an agreed upon Government\npolicy.\n17. Groundwater monitoring will be introduced in Kathmandu Valley. This will cover water\nlevels, water extraction rates, and water quality. Institutional reforms will ensure that the proposed\nprogram of groundwater monitoring receives the necessary human and financial resources to be\nsustained in the long term.\nC.\t Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n18. The estimated cost of the TA is $1.0 million equivalent comprising a foreign exchange\ncost of $600,000 and a local currency cost of $400,000 equivalent. The Bank will finance the", "4\nequivalent of $800,000 on a grant basis from the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of\nJapan, and the Government will finance the equivalent of $200,000. Of the Bank's contribution,\napproximately $660,000 equivalent will be for consultant inputs, and the remainder for surveys,\ntransport, office equipment, and communications. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan\nare given in Appendix 2.\nD.\t Implementation Arrangements\n19. The Executing Agency will be the Ministry of Housing and Physical Planning. The\nProject Director has already been appointed. The international and domestic consultants will be\nsupported by at least ten professionally qualified Government counterparts in the fields of\ngroundwater engineering, financial accounting, water supply engineering, administration, sanitary\nengineering, sociology, hygiene education, and workshop facilitation. Public hearings and workshops\nwill be conducted for concerned stakeholders to express their views about draft proposals for the\nlicensing and charging for groundwater, tariff policy, the regulatory framework for private sector\nmanagement, and water and wastewater tariffs. NGOs will be involved in the preparation and\nimplementation of the public awareness campaign.\n20. The TA will start in June 1998 and finish in December 1999. The consultants will\nproduce an inception report in July 1998; interim reports in September 1998, December 1998, and\nJune 1999; and a completion report in December 1999. Monthly progress reports will also be\nprovided beginning in August 1998. At the consultant contract negotiations a schedule for\nparticipatory workshops will be agreed upon.\n21. A total of 18 person-months of international consulting services is proposed consisting\nof a hydrogeologist (2 person-months), a financial analyst (6 person-months), a water supply\nengineer (3 person-months), a private sector regulator (4 person-months), and a wastewater/sanitary\nengineer (3 person-months). Inputs from domestic consultants, totaling 38 person-months, include a\nfinancial analyst (6 person-months), a water supply engineer (20 person-months), a sanitary\nengineer (6 person-months), and a hydrogeologist (6 person-months). The outline terms of\nreference for the consulting services are provided in Appendix 3. The consultants will be recruited in\naccordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Most of the consultant inputs will\nbe required before the end of 1998, but intermittent inputs will continue until the end of 1999. The\nteam leader of the consultants is envisaged to be the international financial analyst. The domestic\nwater supply engineer will be the deputy team leader.\n22. The Government will provide appropriate furnished accommodation. Other\nGovernment contributions to the Project will comprise (I) per diems and remuneration for counterpart\nstaff, (ii) socioeconomic surveys and organization of public hearings and workshops, (iii) water\nquality testing and river flow monitoring, (iv) survey and registration of private groundwater extraction\nin Kathmandu Valley, and (v) implementation of a public awareness campaign through various\nmedia including NGOs.\nIV.\t THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION\n23. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, to His Majesty's Government of Nepal in an\namount not exceeding the equivalent of $800,000 for the purpose of Urban Water Supply Reforms\nin Kathmandu Valley, and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "Appendix 1, page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDESIGN SUMMARY\t PROJECT TARGETS\t MONITORING MECHANISMS ASSUMPTIONS AND RISKS\nSectorlArea Goals\n1.Sustainable water\t Institutional responsibility Annual report of Water and\t Liaison with Bank\nresource management for KV water resources\t Energy Commission Secretariat\t engineering loan (Melamchi)\n2.Piped water supplies in management\nKathmandu Valley\t Annual report of water utility\t World Bank continued\nMelamchi Water Supply\t support to urban water supply\nProject implementation\t rehabilitation and private\nsector management\nPrivate sector\nmanagement of\t Government commitment to\nKathmandu Valley water\t reforms\nsupply_________________________________ _____________________________\nPurpose\n1.Create foundation for\t Private sector\t Water utility performance\t Government commitment to\nprivate sector\t management contract\t parameters monitored by\t reforms\nmanagement of KV\t awarded by February\t regulator\nwater supply\t 1999\t Good progress by World\nBank-funded consultants for\n2.Plan for control of GW Institutional responsibility Groundwater and wastewater\t private sector management\nand wastewater in KV\t for GW and wastewater quarterly monitoring reports\nmonitoring in KV with\t (NWSC)\nappropriate budget\n________________________ allocation\t ______________________________ __________________________\nComponents\n1.Urban water supply\t By Sep 1998 regulatory\t Bank mission BTORs and\t Project director remains in\npolicy\t framework, tariff, and\t project director correspondence\t place for duration of TA\ncost recovery policies to\n2.Cost recovery & tariff\t be endorsed by the\t Consultant competency\npolicy\t Government\t demonstrated\n3.Regulatory framework\t By Feb 1999\ngroundwater monitoring\n4.Wastewater\t and groundwater\nmanagement plan\t licensing introduced and\nregulatory framework\n5.Public awareness\t established\ncampaign\nBy Nov 1999 wastewater\n6.Groundwater licensing plan and urban water\nsupply sector policy\n7.Groundwater\t endorsed by the\nmonitoring\t Government, and public\nawareness campaign\ncompleted\n(Reference in text: page 2, para. 10)", "Appendix 1 page 2\nDESIGN SUMMARY\t PROJECT TARGETS\t MONITORING\t ASSUMPTIONS\n_________________ _____________________________ MECHANISMS\t AND RISKS\nActivities\n1.Hold public hearings $800000 equivalent financing by Bank\t Consultant monthly Timely\nand workshops with\t progress reports as consultant\nstakeholders for\t well as interim\t recruitment\npreparation of policy\t reports:\t and timely\nand regulatory\t July 1998\t implementation\nframework\t September 1998\t of consultant\nDecember 1998\t inputs\nJune 1999\nNovember 1999\n2.

General\n1. The consultants are expected to liaise closely with those for the Melamchi\nWater Supply Project and the World Bank-funded Private Sector Management Contract\nPreparation. Timing of the sector reforms is critical to both the proposed investments\nas well as operational changes for water supplies within Kathmandu Valley. The\nreforms are to be developed through a participatory and consultative process involving\nworkshops for stakeholders, public hearings, and a public awareness program.\nB. Urban Water Supply Policy\n\t2.\t The policy to be formulated will be unique to the Kathmandu Valley but will be\nincorporated within the National Water Supply Policy. The consultants will address:\n(i) urban water supply within the context of comprehensive water resource\nmanagement,\n(ii) institutional and sector administration responsibilities,\n(iii) operation and maintenance including unaccounted-for water reduction and\nother performance indicators,\n(iv) levels of service including those to the urban poor,\n(v) capital investment mechanisms and development plans,\n(vi) private sector participation,\n(vii) subsidies and cost recovery objectives,\n(viii) human resources development, and\n(ix) public awareness and hygiene education.\nC. Financial AnalysislCost Recovery/Tariff Policy\n3.\t The consultants will undertake the following tasks.\n(i) Review the past five years financial performance of the Nepal Water\nSupply Corporation (NWSC); describe sources of funding and terms of\nfunding made available to the sector and to NWSC, and comment on\ncompliance with World Bank covenants, level of cost recovery, adequacy\nof current levels of tariffs to meet operation and maintenance costs, debt\nservicing, and contributions to capital investment financing.\n(ii) Calculate the cost of water supply in economic and financial prices,\naverage incremental economic cost, and average incremental financial\ncost; comment on their appropriateness for guiding current and future\n(Reference in text: page 4, para. 21)", "Appendix 3, page 2\n10\ntariff policy and tariff structures; quantify current subsidies, determining\nwhom they benefit and a schedule for phasing them out.\n(iii) Review existing tariff policies and tariff structures for the urban water\nsupply sector in Kathmandu Valley; examine and comment on existing\neconomic, financial, social, and environmental policies used to formulate\ntariff policies and structures.\n(iv) Review institutional, regulatory, and legal frameworks in which tariff\npolicies and tariff structures are formulated and revise.\n(v) Develop cost recovery policies for water and wastewater services that\nallow proper levels of operation and maintenance, debt service, and a\nproportion of the sector's future capital expenditure to be met; on the\nbasis of cost recovery policies, formulate financial objectives for NWSC.\n(vi) Develop a licensing and tariff structure to be established for private\ngroundwater extraction that reflects the opportunity cost of water and\nNWSC water tariffs.\n(vii) Formulate onlending policies for project financing for both foreign and\nlocal sources.\n(viii) Make recommendations on the performance indicators necessary to\ndetermine technical and financial performance and incentive/\nremuneration structures applicable to a private sector management-type\ncontract.\nD.\t Regulatory Framework\n4. The objective is to provide a regulatory function for water tariffs including\ngroundwater extraction, water quality and service levels, wastewater pollution control, and\nprivate sector management of water supplies. For this purpose, it will be necessary to\nidentify precisely what will be regulated, when and by whom it will be done, and what\nresources are needed. Operational budgets will be prepared for each regulatory function. A\nphased approach is envisaged, whereby only simple regulation is introduced at the start,\nbut more comprehensive regulation follows with time. Appropriate performance indicators\nwill be identified and, to the extent possible, measured for benchmarking purposes. Short-,\nmedium-, and long-term performance targets will be defined. Considerable liaison and\ncoordination with other consultants, agencies, and concerned stakeholders will be required.\nE. Public Awareness Campaign\n5. The objective of this campaign is to provide transparency and understanding of\nthe sector and its reforms to the public in general and concerned stakeholders in particular.\nThe campaign will be designed to be sustainable in the long term and thus institutionalized.\nIt will address tariffs, water conservation, water pollution, and hygiene education and will\nrelate these to ongoing development plans and operations. Special attention will be given to\nschool programs and to utilizing all types of media for conveying the messages to the\npeople. The design and implementation of the campaign will be based on a participatory\napproach.", "Appendix 3, page 3\n11\nF. Groundwater Monitoring and Licensing\n6.\t The consultants will:\n(i) ascertain the extent of groundwater extraction through a comprehensive\nregistration survey of all groundwater use in Kathmandu Valley;\n(ii) design a system for accurate monitoring of groundwater levels, groundwater\nquality, and groundwater extraction volumes using existing and new bores;\n(iii) identify major groundwater users and introduce measurement of water\nextracted;\n(iv) procure and install all necessary monitoring equipment, making due\nprovision for repairs and breakdowns;\n(v) set up a simple computerized database and mapping system for\ngroundwater monitoring;\n(vi) marshal sufficient human and financial resources for continued groundwater\nmonitoring;\n(vii) through legislation and supported by the regulatory framework, introduce\nappropriate licensing and charging for groundwater use; and\n(viii) train the nominated personnel for future monitoring of groundwater and for\npreparation of annual groundwater monitoring reports.\nG. Wastewater Management Plan\n7. The consultants will review the wastewater management plan that was\nprepared in 1988 for Kathmandu Valley. They will investigate what has been implemented\nand what has not, and will determine what were the implementation constraints. New water\nquality data will be collected over a period of 12 months, and new developments affecting\nwastewater management will be identified. The consultants will update the master plan in a\nbrief report and prepare a priority list of investments and regulatory controls needed to\nimprove wastewater management in the Kathmandu Valley. The means of implementation\nwill be clearly spelled out."], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20080229191654+08'00'", "Creator": "Envision OCR", "Keywords": "tar: 31620 nep, urban water supply, water resources management, kathmandu urban development, private sector management\r\n\r\n", "Producer": "www.adlibsoftware.com:EXS3185-Windows 2003:TNG", "ModDate": "D:20080410112546+08'00'", "Title": "Urban Water Supply Reforms in Kathmandu Valley"}}
