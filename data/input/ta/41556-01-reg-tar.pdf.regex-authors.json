INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The research and development technical assistance (TA) project was included in the \n2007 TA program of the Regional and Sustainable Development Department (RSDD) of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) to support the establishment of the Cities Development Initiative \nfor Asia (CDIA).1 ADB and the German Development Cooperation Ministry have established the \nmultidonor CDIA to contribute to improving the living conditions of people in Asian cities by \nimproving the process of formulating and financing public services delivery in urban areas. The \ngovernments of Sweden and Spain have also agreed to participate in the initiative and to \nprovide approximately $7 million in support.2 However, project identification and preparation \nactivities\u2014which are core to the operation of CDIA\u2014are not adequately funded, given the huge \ndemand  (i)  identified  under  the  regional  TA  on  Managing  the  Cities  in  Asia;3  and  (ii) \ndemonstrated by 2 years of CDIA operations, which identified some 16 cities and $5 billion of \ninfrastructure projects. The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT) is \nthe \u201ccity and shelter agency\u201d of the United Nations system and has been involved in CDIA from \nits launch. UN-HABITAT is seeking to work with ADB and its CDIA partners to assist with project \nformulation; UN-Habitat has identified a significant pipeline of projects as a result of its ongoing \nprograms in the sector. In addition, CityNet, a network of local governments in Asia, has agreed \nto join the initiative to strengthen the networking aspects of CDIA. The project is consistent with \nADB\u2019s Long-Term Strategic Framework 2008\u20132020 (Strategy 2020).4 Strategy 2020 focuses \nADB operations in three areas: inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, \nand regional integration. This TA supports CDIA in better responding to both demands of \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) and ADB\u2019s operational needs by providing assistance for \npreparation of projects that respond to Strategy 2020 priorities and networking among cities as \na basis for scaling up infrastructure investment. The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Urban economies play a central role in Asia\u2019s economic growth and development, but \nAsian urban areas have had difficulty in coping with the rapid growth: 44 million people are \nadded to city populations every year, equivalent to 120,000 people each day. This requires the \nconstruction each day of more than 20,000 new dwellings, 250 km of new roads and additional \ninfrastructure to supply more than 6 megalitres of potable water.5 In order to be relevant to the \nneeds of its DMCs, ADB operations need to maximize the opportunities of urbanization and \naddress its negative impacts. Institutions that manage urbanization often lack coordination, \ncapacity, and finance. The struggle to address global environmental problems and meet the \nMillennium Development Goals will be most difficult in Asia\u2019s urban areas. \n \n3.  Concerns about the social and environmental impact of urban development are growing. \nUnderserviced urban growth often leads to declining environmental quality, congestion, and \npollution, which is detrimental to the residents\u2019 quality of life, even as incomes rise. About 70% \nof the world\u2019s poor live in Asia. Nearly one third of the urban poor do not have access to safe \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 September 2007. \n2   This support will be channeled to the CDIA through a change of scope to ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for \nManaging the Cities in Asia. Manila (TA 6293-REG). \n3   ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Managing the Cities in Asia. Manila (TA 6293-REG, approved on 19 \nDecember). \n4   ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila.  \n5   ADB. 2006.

About the same number live in \nenvironmentally  dangerous  areas  and/or  slums  and  lack  secure  tenure.  High  levels  of \nenvironmental stress compound poverty. The economic impact of pollution in Asian urban \nareas,  in  terms  of  loss  of  productivity  and  health  costs,  is  estimated  at  1%\u20135%  of  gross \ndomestic product. \n \n4.  In this context, urban development is increasingly difficult for many governments to \nmanage. In many countries, ADB also has difficulty assisting governments in improving urban \nservices, both because of shortfalls in the capacity of counterpart institutions and ADB\u2019s own \nconstraints.6 In addition, the private sector (at both national and local levels) is increasingly able \nand willing to participate in urban service delivery. ADB recognizes these strategic shifts and is \nplanning  to  increase  both  the  quantity  and  quality  of  urban  lending  by  (i)  leveraging  and \nconsolidating cofinancing under longer-term programmatic interventions, (ii) bolstering sector \nknowledge and the quality of strategic sector analyses and/or diagnostics, and (iii) supporting \nurban networking and outreach as a means of demonstrating ADB\u2019s value-addition. ADB\u2019s \nurban initiatives focus on actions that will mobilize resources for priority investments under \nStrategy 2020. Specifically, the Urban Financing Partnership Facility7 will act as the umbrella for \nfunds mobilization, with CDIA constituting a framework agreement under the Urban Financing \nPartnership Facility. \n \n5.  ADB  and  its  CDIA  partners  play  an  important  role  in  supporting  Asian  cities  and \nbolstering urban lending. As a financier, ADB can help deliver and leverage needed investment \nin infrastructure services, in particular under the Innovation and Efficiency Initiative,8 and other \napproaches  as  appropriate  to  clients\u2019  needs.  As  a  development  institution  with  extensive \nexperience in urban planning, infrastructure services reform, and poverty reduction, ADB is well \nplaced to deliver knowledge products and finance for sustainable and inclusive development of \nthe region\u2019s cities and towns. Additionally, ADB can act as a strong partner in policy dialogue, \nwork at multiple levels of government, and foster partnerships with the private sector. By linking \nto CDIA partners, ADB can leverage its assistance, extending the impact of its TA and engaging \nin new areas. \n \n6.  The mandate of UN-HABITAT is to assist countries and cities achieve the goals of \n\u201csustainable human settlements\u201d and \u201cshelter for all\u201d. UN-HABITAT\u2019s Regional Office for Asia \nand the Pacific, located in Fukuoka, Japan, has been providing technical support to national and \nlocal governments in Asia to address their human settlements needs. UN-HABITAT seeks to \nlink  its  Sustainable  Cities  Program  (SCP)  network  of  cities  to  CDIA  to  assist  them  in \nimplementing  investments  identified  through  SCP  and  other  activities.  In  addition,  CityNet, \nbased in the city of Yokohama, has offered to support the program, adding its network and \nbuilding on its Smart Cities Program, which links developing countries with expertise needed to \ndevelop environmental infrastructure. \n \n                                                 \n6  A 2006 study (ADB. 2006. Special Evaluation Study on Urban Sector Strategy and Operations. Manila.) rated the \nurban sector strategy as relevant and effective, but only partly efficient and less sustainable due mainly to staffing \nand lending modality constraints on ADB urban operations. \n7  ADB. 2009.

THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n7.  ADB proposes the present TA as a core activity in its response to the changing context \nof urbanization in Asia and to the issues raised in the Special Evaluation Study on Urban Sector \nStrategy and Operations (footnote 6) and in response to the infrastructure focus of Strategy \n2020  (footnote  4).  This  response  is  focused  on  more  effective  support  to  ADB's  urban \noperations through the community of practice (COP), and on more effective partnerships. The \nproposed TA addresses these issues, providing resources for more flexible approaches to \nproject formulation and capacity development by operations departments. \n \n8.  The TA will contribute to improved management of cities of all sizes in ADB\u2019s DMCs by \nincreasing the number of urban infrastructure projects ready for detailed assessment (project \npreparatory TA) and subsequent funding by ADB and CDIA partners. The TA will support \nproject identification and knowledge management activities for an initial period of 14 months. \nThe TA will also examine ways of making CDIA activities sustainable over a longer term \ntimeframe. The TA activities will provide: \n \n(i)  technical support for prefeasibility studies, and \n(ii)  support to cities in knowledge and capacity development through networking \nactivities in order to strengthen the capacity of cities to prepare and implement \ninfrastructure projects. \n \n9.  The TA will support DMCs in undertaking more effective project due diligence, project \nstructuring, and project implementation for urban development projects. This will (i) enable  \n(a)  improved  technical,  legal,  and  financial  design  of  projects;  and  (b)  better  project \nadministration; and (ii) lower the transaction costs of structuring responsive urban projects. The \nTA will provide demand-driven assistance to DMCs9 through ADB's operations departments.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The activities set out in para. 8 define the two components of the TA, as detailed below. \n \n11.  Project preparation support.  RSDD will make a pool of funds available to operations \ndepartments for formulating projects and/or programs in waste management, urban transport, \nurban subsovereign finance, and urban economic (cluster) development that can be financed \nby ADB for selected cities. The projects and/or programs will be identified, prioritized, and \nreviewed in close collaboration with operations departments, based on (i) the outputs of the \nknowledge activities of the urban COP,  and (ii) relevant projects identified by operations \ndepartments. Once projects and/or programs are selected, suitable consultants will be engaged \nto meet the specific needs of each project or program. These consultants will be engaged by \nRSDD in consultation with operations departments. RSDD will manage the consultants in close \ncollaboration with the clients and operations departments as they conduct prefeasibility studies, \ninitial implementation activities, etc. The urban COP will play a key role in providing guidance to \nconsultants. Priority will be given to subsovereign and public\u2013private partnership projects. A \nlocal consultant will be engaged to help RSDD manage TA activities. From consultations with \noperations departments, these projects are expected to focus on one city from each of the \nfollowing DMCs: India, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, and Viet Nam. \n                                                 \n9  ADB would obtain government \"no objection\" prior to undertaking activities in a country.  \n ", "4  \n \n12.  Support to knowledge networks and capacity development. It was intended that \nCDIA would form a network of cities interested in improving their capacity to plan for, finance, \nand implement urban infrastructure projects, but this aspect of the initiative was not pursued \nwhile  initial  prefeasibility  activities  were  underway.  This  component  of  the  TA  will  provide \nconsultant support and systems to scale up CDIA networking activities, which will link cities in \ndeveloping countries to expertise\u2014both from companies and from other \u201cmentor\u201d cities\u2014that \ncan  provide  successful  practical  examples  of  infrastructure  planning,  financing,  and \nimplementation. Such activities will both increase the quality of project formulation and provide \nADB with quality funding opportunities in line with the priorities of Strategy 2020. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,000,000. The TA will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Special Fund funded by the Government of Japan. The cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency for the TA, with RSDD as the nodal department for \nimplementation.  RSDD  will  undertake  the  TA  activities  as  directed  by  the  urban  COP  in \ncollaboration with operations departments. The TA implementation team will be comprised of a \nteam leader in RSDD reporting to a subcommittee of the COP. Implementation will be supported \nby international and national consultants. RSDD will undertake TA activities in collaboration with \nrelevant operations departments. A no-objection letter from the relevant DMCs will be obtained \nbefore commencing any activities in the territory of these DMCs. The TA implementation team \nwill  comprise  a  team  leader  from  RSDD  supported  by  a  subcommittee  of  the  urban  COP. \nImplementation will take place over 18 months from June 2010. For both components, ADB will \nengage consultants in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as \namended from time to time). \n \n15.  Implementing  component  1  of  the  TA  will  require  about  30  person-months  of \ninternational  consultant  and  100  person-months  of  national  consultant  services,  contracted \nusing the consultants\u2019 qualification selection or single source selection, as appropriate.10 This \nmodality  is  appropriate  as  the  projects  in  this  component  are  to  be  chosen  during \nimplementation  through  consultation  between  the  urban  COP  and  governments.  As  such, \nflexibility in team formation is required. The projects will typically be undertaken by small teams \nof consultants highly specialized in the sector and country. The project formulation consultants \nwill  undertake  technical  studies  and  specialized  analytical  studies  to  support  project \ndevelopment  under  the  guidance  of  the  urban  COP  and  the  supervision  of  operations \ndepartments. Outline terms of reference are set out in Appendix 3. Operations departments will \nuse the established one-page application format for urban COP support, to be approved at \nmonthly meetings. The terms of reference and project formulation milestones will be determined \nby operations department supervising offices. The consultants will be engaged by ADB in \naccordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. \n                                                 \n10  The consultants\u2019 qualifications selection method may be used for small assignments where highly specialized \nexpertise is required for the assignment and recruitment of \u201cboutique\u201d consulting firms that provide depth of \nexpertise in specific areas is contemplated. For single source selection, indicatively, half will be by cost and quality \nselection, which is the preferred method if the assignment requires joint efforts from various experts. Where a \ncompetitive tender among firms qualified for the assignment is not possible, the consultants will be engaged \nthrough individual consultant selection. \n ", "    5 \n         \n     \n \n16.  Implementing component 2 of the TA will require technical inputs to the CDIA, and \nsupport of CDIA networking activities. These activities will require about 5 person-months of \ninternational consultant and 40 person-months of national consultant services. It is proposed \nthat  UN-HABITAT  be  contracted  on  a  single-source  basis  to  provide  specialized  inputs  to \ncoordinate CityNet and consultants\u2019 inputs for networking activities. By providing access to the \nCityNet and SCP networks, UN-HABITAT will help ADB identify the potential investment needs \nand priorities of its network cities. The UN-HABITAT Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific (in \nFukuoka, Japan) has developed a network of cities in Asia and Pacific region, and assisted \nthem  in  developing  city-level  strategies,  through  structured  participatory  and  consultative \nprocesses, to identify potential development projects related to water supply, sanitation, waste \nmanagement, urban environment, slum upgrading, and socioeconomic development. Adequate \nsupport to capacity development for infrastructure financing in these cities, particularly involving \npublic\u2013private partnerships, will open opportunities for city governments to tap funding from \nADB, other CDIA partners and the private sector in order to address their urban investment \nneeds.  This  support  will  be  provided  through  the  development  and  dissemination\u2014via \nestablished SCP and CityNet processes\u2014of appropriate learning materials, which will be based \nat least in part on the outcomes of component 1. Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \nThe consultants will be engaged by UN-Habitat in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants.  UN-Habitat  consultants will  include  a  local consultant  provided  to  the \nsecretariat of CDIA to assist in coordination, and to liaise between ADB and UN-Habitat. \n \n17.  The  TA  implementation  team  will  closely  collaborate  and  regularly  consult  with  the \noperations departments. The team will organize focused discussions, workshops, and seminars \nas  appropriate.  RSDD  will  coordinate  input  as  required  from  other  initiatives  in  water, \nsustainable transport, energy efficiency, etc. Staff will be supported under the TA to participate \nas resource persons in workshops where appropriate. The TA will be implemented over 18 \nmonths, starting in June 2010 and ending in December 2011. The TA outcome will be evaluated \nwith  a  view  toward  contributing  to  ADB\u2019s  policy  dialogue  with  DMCs,  demand  for  CDIA \nassistance, and developments in DMCs related to the management of cities in the region.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n18.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  the  provision  of  technical \nassistance  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $2,000,000  on  a  grant  basis  for  the  Project \nPreparation Support for the Cities Development Initiative for Asia. \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1   \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved management of  The infrastructure, service  Urban sector and sector  There is greater commitment \ncities of all sizes in  delivery, and  and/or thematic reports of  by stakeholders and \ndeveloping member  environmental parameters  DMC governments and  policymakers in DMCs to \ncountries (DMCs)  in these cities, along with  international organizations  improve management of cities \nfinancial management of   \nmunicipalities   \n   \nAchievement of  Asian Development Bank  Improved knowledge and policy \nMillennium Development  (ADB) and international  dialogue translates into \nGoals (MDGs), in  progress reports on the  improved management of cities \nparticular to improve the  MDGs   \nlives of at least 100 million   \nslum dwellers by 2020 \n(target 4 of MDG 7)\nOutcome  Assumptions \nImproved design of ADB  Better sector  DMC reports and ADB  DMC policy makers and \noperations in Asian  diagnostics and project  CPSs and programs  stakeholders have a continued \ncities  development processes    interest in improving \n    CPS and DMC feedback  management of cities \n    received through various \n  Increased demand for  formal and informal channels  Key regional experts engage \n  ADB assistance    effectively in this analytical work \n  related to  Project processing   \n  management and  information systems  ADB capacity to respond to \n  development of cities  and CPSs  increased demand for \n      assistance increases \n       \n     \nEnhancement of ADB\u2019s  Improved inputs to country  Country assistance \nability to resource these  partnership strategies  program evaluation \nimprovements in  (CPSs) based on ADB\u2019s  (CAPEs) \noperations and its  policy dialogue with DMCs   \nknowledge base     \n     \nEnhanced capacity of  Funding commitments  Project Processing \nAsian cities to fund  Information System \ninfrastructure investments  (PPIS) \nOutputs      Risks \n1.

General \n \n1.  The technical assistance (TA) project will require inputs from international and national \nconsultants drawn from a range of experts, institutions, and organizations. The consultants will \ninclude urban and infrastructure experts in the areas of planning, energy, transport, water \nsupply  and  sanitation,  environment,  municipal  management,  urban  finance  and  urban \neconomics. The national consultants will provide technical and research assistance support for \nthe TA project implementation team and should have strong backgrounds and experience in \ndata collection and analysis, and relevant experience in the urban sector. A small secretariat will \nmanage  the  TA  project  and  respond  to  requests  by  the  operations  departments.1Other \nconsultants will be engaged on short-term assignments as required by operations departments. \nThe  detailed  terms  of  reference  for  the  consultants  and  their  engagement  periods  will  be \nfinalized based on requests of operations departments in consultation with the managing task \nforce during TA implementation. \n \nB.  Component 1 Consultants \n \n1.  Urban and Infrastructure Consultants (international, 30 person-months) \n \nThe task of the urban and infrastructure consultants will be to: (i) undertake research in the \nareas of waste management, urban transport, cluster development, and municipal finance; and \n(ii) provide technical recommendations for enhancing project design operations, and analyze the \nimpact of that support. This analysis will provide support to the urban community of practice \n(COP) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and to the establishment of a partnership facility \nfor the sector that will fund enhanced urban operations.
