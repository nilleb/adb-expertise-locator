Madhya Pradesh (MP) Transco and distribution companies (DISCOMs) have prepared \ndetail project proposal (DPR), outlining the requirements of new transmission and distribution \nassets, and their cost estimates. The DPR has been approved by the MP Energy Department \nand submitted for approval of the Ministry of Power of the Central government and Department \nof Economic Affairs (DEA). However, the depth and coverage of technical justification, and \nfinancial, and economic analyses of the DPR is inadequate to meet the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) standards of project due diligence. The analyses presented by the transmission \nand distribution companies need to be critically reviewed and updated.  Moreover, social and \nenvironmental  safeguards  are  not  covered  in the  DPR,  and  additionally,  a  detailed  sector \nanalysis is required to meet the ADB requirements. The project preparatory technical assistance \n(PPTA) resources will be used to conduct these additional analyses and prepare the project \ndocuments for ADB approval. \n \nB.  Major Outputs and Activities \n2.  The main output of the PPTA will be a project feasibility report which include: (i) MP \npower sector assessment (ii) updated problem tree analysis and DMF; (iii) project description \nand detailed cost estimates; (iv) economic and financial analyses; and (v) initial environmental \nexaminations (IEEs), environmental management plans (EMPs), and resettlement plans (RPs). \nOutputs also include a feasibility report on solar irrigation in MP and a presentation on solar \nirrigation to Ministry of Power and DEA.1  \n \n3.

Currently the Government of India spends an \nestimated $20 billion power subsidy for irrigation. Agricultural water pumping is a major cause of system instability \nand power subsidies for agriculture is a major reason for poor financial performance of DISCOMs. Replacing the \ngrid connected and diesel pumps with solar powered pumps improve system stability and cost recovery, and help \nmitigating climate change. It also avoids local air pollution.  Therefore solar irrigation is an integral part of the longe \nterm solution to power sector problems in India.  Small amount of resources of the PPTA is allocated to \nsystematically examine the feasibility of solar irrigation in India with the view to engage government on a dialogue \nto open up future ADB interventions.
