The Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) has requested technical \nassistance  (TA)  from  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  to  help  prepare  the  Kunming \nQingshuihai Water Supply Project. The TA is included in the 2006\u20132008 country strategy and \nprogram update.1 The Fact-Finding Mission visited the PRC in March 2006, and reached an \nunderstanding with the Government on the impact and outcome, scope, cost and financing, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Kunming is the capital of Yunnan Province, which is in southwestern PRC. Yunnan \nProvince is bordered to the south by Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic and Viet Nam, to the \nwest by Myanmar, to the east by Guangxi and Guizhou provinces, PRC, and to the north by \nSichuan and Tibet provinces. As the PRC seeks to forge closer trading links with its neighbors \nin the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Yunnan Province\u2014and consequently Kunming\u2014\nassumes  greater  strategic  significance  as  a  regional  center.  Centrally  located  within  the \nprovince, Kunming is a city of 5.78 million people, including approximately 2.46 million who \nreside within the main urban area. As the provincial capital, Kunming is the political, commercial, \nand cultural center of the province, as well as an important transportation hub. \n \n3.  Kunming comprises 1 county-level city, 5 districts, and 8 counties. As in many large PRC \ncities,  rapid  economic  growth  over  the  past  20  years  has  increased  the  stress  on  the \nenvironment. In particular, the quality of water in Lake Dianchi has fallen to class V2 or below, \nwhich means it is no longer suitable as a water source for urban needs. Based on United \nNations criteria, Kunming is classified as a city with a severe shortage of water resources. The \nloss of Lake Dianchi as a useable water resource has made the shortage worse.  \n \n4.  Kunming has a well-prepared and thorough development plan, with a principal planning \nhorizon of 2020. The city\u2019s main development objectives are to sustain a high rate of economic \ngrowth as the main means for improving the quality of residents\u2019 lives, and to reduce the poverty \nthat still exists for some urban and rural residents. Further, rapid gross domestic product growth \nis needed to create jobs for the continuing migration of people from rural areas to the urban \nareas.  \n \n5.  The proposed project will address the projected water shortages in the fast-developing \nNew Airport Economic Zone and the Eastern Development Zone of Kunming City. These are \nidentified  as  newly  urbanized  areas  under  the  Kunming  City  master  plan.  The  Kunming \nmunicipal government (KMG) has included the proposed project in its 11th City Five-Year Plan \nfor 2006\u20132010, which was approved recently. In July 2005, the Yunnan Water Conservancy and \nHydropower Survey, Design and Research Institute prepared a draft feasibility study report \n(FSR). The Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) is financing a separate water \nsupply project (Kunming Water Supply Project), which is under construction. The JBIC Project \nwill  provide  additional water  to  the  northern part  of  the  main  urban  area.  ADB  previously \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. People\u2019s Republic of China: Country Strategy and Program Update (2006\u20132008). Manila. The TA first \nappeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 6 April 2006. \n2 The PRC environmental quality standards have five classes for surface water quality based on their use. Class I is \nthe best in quality and class V is the worst. Class I is for water resources and nationally protected water bodies. \nClass II is for high-value fish protection areas, class A protection areas, and spawning habitats for fish. Class III is \nfor potable water resources, class B protection areas, general fish protection areas, and swimming areas. Class IV \nis for general industrial water sources and noncontact recreational areas. Class V is suitable only for industrial use. \n ", "2   \nprovided  support  for  the  development  of  urban  water  resources  in  the  PRC.  The  project \nobjectives are similar to the Harbin Water Supply Project,3 which is being implemented, and the \nearlier Dalian Water Supply Project.4 \n \n6.  One of ADB\u2019s strategic objectives in the PRC is to improve the environment and protect \nnatural resources. The proposed project is consistent with ADB\u2019s strategy. In support of the \nstrategy,  policy  dialogue  will  continue  on  (i)  integrated  urban  development  planning,  (ii) \nintegrated water resources management, (iii) water sector institutional arrangements, (iv) water \npricing as a demand management tool, (v) private sector involvement, and (vi) tariffs and \nfinancial sustainability. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA will prepare a project to improve the living and health conditions of Kunming, as \nwell as facilitate economic development in the city, through the provision of reliable water \nsupplies. The project will assist the Government in providing 104 million cubic meters (m3) of \nwater annually from Qingshuihai Lake, some 100 kilometers (km) north of the main urban area \nof Kunming. The new water resources will benefit the New Airport Economic Zone (62 million m3 \na year), the Eastern Development Zone (35 million m3 a year), and Xundian County (7 million \nm3 a year). About 6.4 million residents in these areas are expected to benefit from 24-hour \nwater supply assured by the project. Further, the project will help the Government achieve the \nMillennium  Development  Goal  for  environmental  sustainability  (Goal  7),  and  to  halve  the \nproportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation by \n2015 (Target 10).The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA will review and analyze the medium- and long-term sector plans for water supply \nand wastewater management in Kunming Municipality. This review will be conducted within the \ncontext of the principles of integrated water resources management and the Kunming City \nmaster plan. The TA will recommend improvements in the sector plans to make them more \nresponsive to the development objectives of Kunming, and to improve water services to all \nresidents, including vulnerable groups. The scope of works included in the project proposal and \ndraft FSR prepared by KMG will be analyzed in the context of the Kunming City Masterplan, and \nthe sector plans and policies. The TA will focus on (i) integrated water resources management; \n(ii) urban poverty reduction, social protection, and resettlement policies; (iii) tariff reform to \nrecover full costs of operation and maintenance, as well as depreciation; (iv) use of tariffs as a \nwater demand management tool; (v) enterprise reform and corporate governance; (vi) urban \nand industrial water conservation; (vii) effluent recycling and introduction of clean production \ntechniques; and (viii) private sector involvement.  \n \n9.  The TA also will review the feasibility of the proposed project, covering (i) preparation of \npreliminary engineering designs and cost estimates, (ii) assessment of financial and economic \nviability  and  sustainability,  (iii)  assessment  of  environmental  and  social  soundness,  and \n(iv) development of a design and monitoring framework and implementation arrangements.

Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan to the \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China for the Dalian Water Supply Project. Manila. \n ", "  3\naddition, the TA will (i) review the proposed project implementation arrangements, (ii) assess \nthe need for the Executing Agency and implementing agencies to strengthen financial and \nmanagerial capacity, (iii) prepare an effective operation and maintenance plan for the project \nfacilities, and (iv) develop project-specific education and training programs. The TA also will \nreview potential environmental impacts, including (i) water balance, and the pattern of water use \nin the catchments whose water will be diverted to Qingshuihai Lake; (ii) effects on downstream \nareas that will have less water; and (iii) secondary pollution resulting from additional wastewater \nin the urban areas. KMG\u2019s assessment on alternatives will be reviewed in view of technical \nappropriateness; cost effectiveness; and social, environmental, and resettlement impacts. The \nlocations  of  proposed  reservoir  and  construction  sites  will  be  determined  carefully,  and \nmeasures  to  mitigate  harm  to  the  environment  will  be  planned.  The  proposed  project  is \nexpected to affect about 1,800 persons, including about 800 who will be permanently resettled. \nThe TA will confirm the extent of resettlement required, assess other impacts on the livelihoods \nof  affected  persons,  and  prepare  compensation  and  rehabilitation  options  and  livelihood \nrehabilitation programs. An initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \n10.  The scope of the project will be determined during implementation of the TA. The project \nis expected to comprise the following:  \n(i)  Part A. The development of additional water resources in Xundian County, some \n100 km north of the main urban area of Kunming. This will increase the water \nstorage capacity of Qingshuihai Lake by diverting water from the surrounding \ncatchments of Banqiao River, Shiqiao River, Xintian River, and Tabizi River. \n(ii)  Part B. The conveyance of those water resources south to make them available \nas  an  urban  water  resource.  This  will  take  water  from  Qingshuihai  Lake  to \nTongxin Gate, and then divert the water to the New Airport Economic Zone \nthrough the planned Jinzhongshan Reservoir, and to the Eastern Development \nZone through the Songhuaba Reservoir.  \n(iii)  Part C. Institutional development. This part will aim to strengthen the financial \nand managerial capacity of KMG in implementing the project, and operating and \nmanaging the facilities to be constructed under the project.  \n \n11.  Complementary  investments  are  required  to  make  effective  use  of  the  new  water \nresource, and to prevent secondary pollution from increased wastewater. The Kunming Water \nSupply Company will construct water treatment plants and distribution networks for water supply \nin  the  New  Airport  Economic  Zone  and  the Eastern  Development  Zone.  This company  is \nexpected to purchase raw water produced under the project. The Kunming Drainage Company \nwill build wastewater treatment plants in the New Airport Economic Zone and the Eastern \nDevelopment Zone to treat sewage generated under the project. A water treatment plant was \nconstructed in 2005, and a wastewater treatment plant is planned for Xundian County. These \ncomplementary investments are included in relevant local development plans for 2006\u20132010, \nwhich  the  concerned  local  governments  have  prepared.  The  local  people\u2019s  congress  has \nconsidered and approved the investments. The preliminary cost of the proposed project is \nCNY1,386 million ($173 million equivalent). The proposed ADB loan for $80 million will cover \n46% of project costs. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n12.  The cost of the TA is estimated to be $800,000 equivalent. The Government has asked \nADB to finance $600,000 equivalent. ADB\u2019s TA funding program will provide a grant to finance \nthe TA. The Government will finance the balance of $200,000 by providing counterpart staff, \n ", "4   \noffice  space,  furniture,  administrative  support  services  and  logistics,  preparation  of  the \nenvironmental impact assessment and resettlement plans, and necessary data (and translation \nof  such  data  into  English,  as  needed).  Detailed  cost  estimates  are  in  Appendix  3.  The \nGovernment has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any \nensuing project. \n   \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n13.  KMG will be the Executing Agency for the TA and the subsequent project. A project \nleading group, chaired by the vice mayor of Kunming, has been formed to provide guidance and \nsupport to project preparation. The project leading group includes the directors of the Kunming \nDevelopment  and  Reform  Commission,  the Kunming  Finance  Bureau,  the  Kunming  Water \nBureau  (KWB),  the  Kunming  Planning  Bureau,  the  Kunming  Water  Supply  Company,  the \nKunming Environmental Protection Bureau, the Kunming Land and Resources Bureau, the Lake \nDianchi Administration Bureau, the Administration Committee of Kunming Air Harbor Economic \nZone, Xundian County, Songming County, and Guandu District.  \n \n14.  A project management office (PMO) has been established within the KWB. The director \nof KWB has been appointed as the director of the PMO, which includes representatives at the \nvice director level from the Kunming Development and Reform Commission and the Kunming \nFinance  Bureau.  Representatives  from  other  relevant  bureaus,  including  the  Kunming \nEnvironmental  Protection  Bureau  and  the  Kunming  Land  and  Resources  Bureau,  will  be \nseconded to the PMO when the need arises. The PMO will ensure interagency coordination, as \nwell as access by the consultants to reports, information, and data needed to implement the TA \neffectively.  This  will  include  assistance  in  organizing  environmental,  socioeconomic, \nresettlement, and other required surveys and consultations. The PMO also will be responsible \nfor liaison with ADB during TA implementation, including making local arrangements for ADB \nmissions to review TA progress. KMG will provide one experienced and qualified member of the \nPMO staff to work full time with the TA, in close coordination with the TA consultants.  \n \n15.  The TA will require 14 person-months of international consulting services and 37 person-\nmonths of domestic consulting services. The international consultants will provide expertise in \nwater  resources  management  (6  person-months),  social  analysis  (2  person-months),  dam \nengineering  (1.5  person-months),  environmental  impact  assessment  (1.5  person-months), \nfinancial  analysis  and  financial  management  assessment  (1  person-month),  institutional \nanalysis (1 person-month), and project economic analysis (1 person-month). The domestic \nconsultants will have expertise in civil engineering (6 person-months), resettlement (5 person-\nmonths), water resources (5 person-months), community participation and poverty (4 person-\nmonths), environmental impact assessment (4 person-months), financial analysis (4 person-\nmonths), economic analysis (3 person-months), institutional development (3 person-months), \ncost engineering (2 person-months), and mechanical engineering (1 person-month). ADB will \nselect and engage consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on Use of Consultants and \nother  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  the  selection  and  engagement  of  domestic \nconsultants. The quality- and cost-based selection method, using simplified technical proposal \nprocedures, will be followed. The consultants may procure equipment through shopping in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines.  Upon  completion  of  the  TA,  equipment \nprocured  under  the  TA  will  be  transferred  to  the  EA.  The  outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 4.  \n  \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months, from October 2006 to March 2007. The \nmajor reports required from the consultants are (i) an inception report describing the detailed \n ", "  5\nwork program within 1 month of TA commencement, (ii) an interim report within 3 months of TA \ncommencement, (iii) a draft final report within 5 months of TA commencement, and (iv) a final \nreport 4 weeks after receiving comments from the Government and ADB on the draft final report. \nTripartite meetings will be held with the Government, ADB, and the consultants to discuss the \nTA reports, which will be prepared in English and translated into Chinese. Workshops for a \nbroad group of stakeholders will be held at TA inception, as well as following the presentation \nand Government review of the draft final report. \n \nIV.

Review of Medium- and Long-Term Plans \n \n1.  The project consultants will review and analyze the medium- and long-term sector plans for \nwater supply and wastewater management within Kunming municipality. This will be carried out in \nthe  context  of  broader  integrated  water  resources  management  and  the  Kunming  urban \ndevelopment plan. Based on the review of these plans, the consultants will assess the Kunming \nmunicipal  government  (KMG)  policies  and  strategies  for  water  resources  management  and \npollution control to ensure that a comprehensive approach has been adopted, and all appropriate \noptions have been considered on a least-cost basis. The consultants will recommend changes in \nthe sector plans to make them more responsive to the development objectives of Kunming, and to \nprovide an improved water environment to all its residents, including vulnerable groups.   \n \n2.  The scope of work included in the proposed project, as detailed in the domestic feasibility \nstudy report (FSR), will be analyzed in the context of the Kunming urban development plan and the \nsector plans (para. 1). Reference will be made, as appropriate, to national and provincial sector \npolicies and guidelines on planning, management, and financing of water supply projects. Value-\nadded  recommendations  will  be  made  on  the  suitability  of  the  proposed  project  to  fulfill  the \nobjectives of the medium- and long-term sector plans. Where necessary, the consultants will \nrecommend changes to the scope of the project.  \n \nB.  Policy Dialogue-Related Activities \n \n3.  In relation to the continuing policy dialogue between the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nand the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), in conjunction with ADB\u2019s lending program for the \nurban  development  sector,  the  consultants  will  prepare  notes  for  policy  dialogue,  based  on \ndiscussions with the Yunnan provincial government and KMG. These notes, which will help define \nthe  policy  framework  for  project  implementation,  will  cover  (i)  integrated  water  resources \nmanagement,  (ii)  water  sector  institutional  arrangements,  (iii)  water  pricing  as  a  demand \nmanagement tool, and (iv) private sector involvement. The consultants will review ADB\u2019s water \npolicy1 and Urban Sector Strategy,2 and relevant review reports.3 Further, they will ensure that the \nproposed project design covers the key action items indicated in these strategic documents. The \nconsultants  also  will  identify  any  other  policy  issues  that  should  be  included  in  future  policy \ndialogue between ADB and the PRC, or that are potentially significant to project implementation. \nPolicy notes will be included in the interim, draft final and final reports, as appropriate. \n \nC.  Technical Aspects \n \n4.  The consultants will review the project proposals, FSR, environmental impact assessment \n(EIA), and resettlement plans (RP) prepared by the Executing Agency (EA) for the proposed \nproject, and other related reports used to substantiate the analyses of the FSR. The consultants \nwill review the alternative assessment conducted by KMG and confirm that the best alternative has \nbeen proposed in terms of (i) technical appropriateness; (ii) cost effectiveness; and (iii) social, \nenvironmental, and resettlement impacts. Particular attention will be given to the water demand \nforecasts used in the domestic FSR, as well as the methods and assumptions used in their \nderivation. Based on the reviews, the findings of the domestic FSR will be confirmed and/or \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001. Water for All.

The consultants will review and build on the environmental assessments completed in \nthe  domestic  EIA.  In  addition,  they  will  help  the  Government  prepare  and  undertake  public \nconsultations  required  by  ADB  and  the  Government.  The  consultants  will  coordinate  the \nenvironmental and social analysis to ensure the best use of resources and the effectiveness of \nplanned consultations. The environmental issues to be considered will include  \n(i)  impact of increasing the area of submerged land resulting from reservoir expansion \nand construction;  \n(ii)  water balance and the pattern of water use in the catchments whose water will be \ndiverted to Qingshuihai Lake;  \n(iii)  impact on the downstream areas that will have less water;  \n(iv)  secondary pollution resulting from additional wastewater in the urban areas;  \n(v)  potential nuisance from the construction and operation of proposed facilities;  \n(vi)  soil conservation in farming practices in conjunction with water sources protection, \nand  recommend  an  approach  for  environmental  sustainable  farming  practices, \ntraining, and design to integrate water and soil conservation;  \n(vii)  resettlement;  \n(viii)  construction techniques; and  \n(ix)  material impacts on water quality.          \n \nE.  Financial Analysis and Financial Management Assessment \n \n7.  The consultants will extend the financial analysis presented in the domestic FSR. The \npurpose is to assess the financial and fiscal sustainability of the ensuing project, and financial \nviability  of  the  IA.  The  financial  analysis  and  the  financial  management  assessment  will  be \nundertaken  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Financial  Management  and  Analysis  of \nProjects.  \n \n8.  The financial management assessment will be completed by the interim report. For this \nassessment, the consultants will  \n(i)  use the Standard Project Cost Table (COSTAB) or similar models to analyze and \nsummarize project costs;  \n(ii)  conduct a financial management assessment of the EA and IA, including review of \naccounting and administrative capabilities, the internal control systems, and internal and \nexternal  auditing  procedures;  and  develop  an  action  plan  to  rectify  gaps  and \nweaknesses identified using ADB\u2019s Financial Management Assessment Questionnaire;  \n(iii)  establish financial objectives and targets for the IA and prepare financing plans and \nprojections, including income statements, balance sheets, cash-flow statements, and \nother relevant financial statements in normal terms, for operations for the 15 years after \nproject completion;  \n(iv)  examine the availability of local counterpart funds, and assess the liquidity of KMG for \ndifferent levels of borrowing;  \n(v)  compute in real terms the financial internal rate of return and the average incremental \ncost in financial terms for the project; and  \n(vi)  propose commercial cofinancing and private sector involvement in the financing plan as \nappropriate.  \n \n \n ", "14  Appendix 4 \n \nF.  Economic Analysis \n \n9.  The consultants will work with economic analysts in the appointed design institutes to \ndesign  and  appraise  each  component  of  the  project  according  to  PRC\u2019s  standards  for  the \neconomic analysis of projects. The analysis should be consistent with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for the \nEconomic Analysis of Projects, recent retrospective reports on economic analysis, and relevant \ntechnical notes published by ADB\u2019s Economics and Research Department. \n \n10.  The consultants will review the investment program under the long- and medium-term \nsector development plans. The justification of the investment program should be based on meeting \nbroad social goals at least cost. Analysis of the goals should include a review of the process of \nestablishing them, the role of public participation and input, and public support for the resulting \ngoals. Given the goals, the analysis then should consider how to achieve them at least economic \ncost.  The  analysis  should  aim  to  identify  enhancements  or  improvements  to  policies  and \ninstitutions to attain the goals. Policy analysis also should cover user charges, though they should \nbe considered as a general policy tool, not merely for raising revenue. Further, the consultants will \nreview and evaluate sources of funds for the investment program, including revenue, use charges, \ncommercial credit, concession credit, and external assistance. \n \n11.  The economic analysis will include  \n(i)  review and evaluate the standards or targets for ensuring the reliability of water \nresources; determine if existing standards or targets are economically and socially \njustified;  and  recommend  changes  as  needed  (e.g.,  should  more  efforts  be \ndedicated to demand management rather than provision of increased supplies);  \n(ii)  conduct least-cost analysis covering policy and investment options; and identify the \nleast-cost option to meet the standards or targets, as well as any recommended \nchanges;  \n(iii)  review tariffs for water and wastewater in accordance with ADB\u2019s position on tariffs, \nas described in Technical Note #94 published by ADB\u2019s Economics and Research \nDepartment, and elaborated in other related technical notes, covering, among other \nthings, the extent and justification of any subsidies, helping the poor satisfy their \nbasis  needs,  and  using  charges  to  encourage  efficient  use  of  resources;  and \nrecommend changes to tariffs, as needed;  \n(iv)  forecast demand for water based on projected tariffs, and use those forecasts and \nother relevant information to reassess the scale of the project; and recommend \nchanges to tariffs based on the forecasts of existing tariffs and recommended tariffs, \nif any;  \n(v)  use the forecasts of water demand to estimate the scale of investment in the project \nthat minimizes the expected present value of current and future capacity costs, \nensuring that the scale for the proposed project should balance the cost of present \nand future capacity expansions, as needed; and estimate the cost of any proposed \ndeviations from the least-cost expansion plan; and \n(vi)  evaluate identified investments relative to other opportunities for public investments, \nbased on standard benefit-cost analysis, to the extent feasible, as described in \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on Economic Analysis of Projects, recent retrospective reports on \neconomic analysis, relevant technical notes published by ADB\u2019s Economics and \nResearch Department, and an analysis of poverty in the project\u2019s areas; identify \npriorities for public investments and estimate of public support for the project, based \nsocial surveys; and evaluate how other priorities are being addressed. \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2004.
