The Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise (SME) Development Program Cluster (SDPL) \nwas approved by the Board of Directors of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in October \n2004.1 Its  main  objective  is  to  support  the  Vietnamese  Government\u2019s  efforts  to  create  an \nenvironment that is conducive to SME development. It addresses (i) a policy framework for SME \ndevelopment,  including  institutional  coordination  mechanisms;  (ii)  reforms  of  business \nregistration  and  licensing  systems;  and  (iii)  specific  reforms  to  enhance  SMEs\u2019  access  to \nresources\u2014for both land use and finance. The Government\u2019s Social-Economic Development \nPlans for 2001\u20132005 2 and 2006\u20132010 recognize that the SME sector is a core component for \nthe country\u2019s development.   \n \n2.  As  outlined  in  the  design  and  monitoring  framework  (Appendix  1),  this  project \npreparatory technical assistance (TA) will prepare for SDPL subprogram II, which is included in \nthe country strategy and program update (CSPU), 2006\u20132008, for Viet Nam.3 Like the CSPU, \nthe SDPL reflects ADB\u2019s support for SME development as a means of continuing the country's \npath toward economic growth and poverty reduction (the initial poverty and social analysis is in \nAppendix 2). This TA project will support the strategy by formulating subprogram II, which aims \nto (i) continue reforms to the business environment for SMEs, and (ii) develop alternative \nchannels  of  financial  intermediation  to  banks,  particularly  through  the  development  of  the \nleasing industry.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Viet Nam has made substantial progress in recent years in improving its regulatory and \nbusiness  environment,  as  evidenced  by  the  increase  in  the  number  of  newly  registered \nenterprises.  However,  although  reduced,  business  entry  costs  are  still  excessive  and \ncumbersome licensing requirements continue to constrain business operations. In addition, the \nbasic  economic  and  business  infrastructure  is  not  sufficiently  developed  to  ensure  proper \nfunctioning of a market-based economy. For example, accounting standards and an integrated \nland registry are lacking. The rest of this section analyzes the major challenges facing SMEs, \nthe achievements of subprogram I and the previous TA, and the remaining tasks. \n \nA.  Lack of a National SME Development Plan and Coordination Framework \n4.  The many and varied constraints facing SMEs mean that their development requires \nvision, strategic direction, and effective coordination between the different stakeholders in policy \ndelivery,  both  horizontally  and  vertically.  There  has  in  the  past  been  no  overall  national \n                                                 \n1  The SDPL (ADB. 2004. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed \nLoan to the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam for the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Program. \nManila.) Loan no. 2095-VIE is a cluster loan with two subprograms. The first subprogram was approved for $60 \nmillion (Asian Development Fund [ADF]), and the concept for the second subprogram was approved for $40 million \n($20 million ADF for the program component and $20 million ordinary capital resources for the investment \ncomponent). The SDPL has been further supported by the Agence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) and \nGerman development assistance through KfW Development Bank (KfW) for a combined amount of about $70 \nmillion. Along with the SDPL, the Board also approved TA-4418 (ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the Socialist \nRepublic of Viet Nam for Capacity Building for SME Development. Manila for $1.4 million [cofinanced by Denmark \nand Switzerland]).  \n2  Minstry of Planning and Investment. 2000. The Five-Year Socio-economic Development Plan 2001\u20132005. Hanoi.  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities  on 7 February 2006. \n4  A fact-finding mission fielded in October 2005 reached an understanding with the Government on the purpose, \napproach, and implementation arrangements of the TA.  \n ", "2   \ndevelopment plan that could fulfill these functions. Support programs remain uncoordinated and \noften overlap, reducing their impact.  \n \n5.  Under subprogram I, the Government formulated an SME development action plan, but \nits  implementation  requires  further  assistance.  In  particular,  the  action  plan  needs  to  be \ndisseminated to major stakeholders and SMEs and an assessment made of its overall impact. \nThe Government needs support for the coordinated implementation of its policy and institutional \nframework for the development of the SME sector, including more active involvement by the \nprivate sector. The Government is also keen to have ADB play an important role in stakeholder \ncoordination and has asked ADB to be the co-chair of the SME partnership group (made up of \nfunding agencies, government agencies, and private sector representatives).  \n \nB.  Incomplete Business Registration and Licensing Systems \n6.  Although the Enterprise Law, 1999, simplified business registration by reducing time, \ncost,  and  documentation  requirements,  recent  guidelines  and  their  interpretation  by  local \nauthorities have not been consistent with the law, resulting in further complications for SMEs. \nSimilarly, while the number of licenses required decreased after the Enterprise Law was passed, \nnew licenses have emerged, imposing an additional burden on both SMEs and the government \nadministration. There is a clear need to rationalize existing licenses and to apply standard \napproaches to limit the number of new licenses. With the passage of the Unified Enterprise Law \n(UEL) in 2005, there is momentum for further reform. This includes an expansion of the National \nBusiness Information System (NBIN)\u2014the business registration system\u2014to cover all provinces \nand to provide information to the private sector on licensing requirements and procedures.  \n \n7.  Under subprogram I, the NBIN expansion and business licensing plans were drafted, but \ntheir implementation will require significant capacity building within Government. It is envisioned \nthat the expansion plans will be piloted in a number of districts, and then expanded throughout \nthe country. The business licensing reform plan, a decree under the UEL, was drafted under \nsubprogram I. However, the institutional capacity to implement it effectively, incorporating the \nspecific features and overall spirit of the new UEL, is yet to be established.  \n \nC.  Limited Access to Financial and Physical Resources \n8.  Access to finance remains one of the most critical issues for the SMEs. The costs and \nrisks related to lending to SMEs need to be addressed. Limited access to land use rights \ncertificates  (LURCs)  reduces  their  use  for  collateral  purposes.  The  legal  and  regulatory \nframework under which LURCs are issued needs to be formalized and registration procedures \nfor subsequent transactions need to be streamlined and unified. SMEs\u2019 access to finance would \nalso be improved by an effective secured transactions registry that clearly prioritizes creditors\u2019 \nand  lien  holders\u2019  rights  upon  registration.  Lack  of  collateral  is  compounded  by  unreliable \nfinancial information on SMEs. Financial reporting requirements are felt to be complex and \ndifficult  to  comply  with.  A  simplified  SME  accounting  system  that  adheres  to  International \nAccounting Standards (IAS) needs to be introduced.   \n \n9.  Under subprogram I, the Government drafted SME accounting guidelines. However, \nconsiderable  training  is  needed  to  ensure  that  SMEs  are  fully  familiar  with  the  existing \naccounting system and guidelines. The Government improved the LURC issuance process in a \ngroup of pilot provinces under subprogram I and a plan for a full nationwide expansion of the \nprocess is needed.  \n ", "3 \n \nD.  Limited Financial Resource Availability for Leasing Industry Development \n10.  Leasing is a vital part of a healthy financial sector in emerging economies. It is an \nimportant financial instrument with the potential to play a prominent role in the development of \nthe  financial  sector  in  Viet  Nam.  The  leasing  industry  is  strategically  important  as  it  can \nstimulate investment activity, increase the availability of different financing mechanisms, and \nstimulate economic growth. It is a convenient way for SMEs to acquire capital goods, especially \nin developing countries such as Viet Nam with scarce medium- to long-term capital. Leasing has \nbeen used to modernize industrial facilities and increase capital and labor productivity in many \ncountries.  \n \n11.  However, leasing remains a small segment of the financial sector in Viet Nam, with \nleased assets amounting to D5.4 trillion in 2004\u20132005. The sector has not been able to meet \nthe funding demands of the growing private sector. This can be ascribed to an inadequate \nregulatory framework (especially with regard to registering leased contracts and assets), limited \nfunding sources, the small range of products offered, and low public awareness of leasing \noperations. Some of these regulatory impediments are being addressed under the Second \nFinancial Program Loan Cluster (FSPL II5) and the SDPL.  The TA project Preparing the \nFinancial Sector Development Program III will help identify mechanisms for promoting and \nimplementing financial and operating leases, including accounting and tax aspects; recommend \nlegal remedies for recourse on default lease assets; strengthen the State Bank of Viet Nam \n(SBV) as the industry regulator in its monitoring of leasing operations; and develop a framework \non the operations of finance companies. However, access to long-term funds will remain an \nissue. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The main objective of the TA is to further support the SME development program in \nViet Nam through the effective design and implementation of subprogram II of the SDPL. An \nindicative policy framework for subprogram II was agreed with the Government while the SDPL \nwas being formulated. That framework needs to be refined following recent developments \naffecting the SME sector. The TA will therefore be implemented in two phases. In the first \nphase, a diagnostic assessment of the progress made so far under SDPL will be made. The \nmajor  challenges  and  the  most  effective  policies  will  be  identified.  In  the  second  phase, \nimplementation of subprogram II will be supported through the provision of (i) technical support, \n(ii) capacity building activities, and (iii) support for consensus building (include donor agency \ncoordination). The major outcomes are outlined below. \n \n                                                 \n5  FSPL II was approved by the ADB Board of Directors on November 2002 for $75 million. Under FSPL II, the SBV, \nin cooperation with related ministries and agencies, issued guidelines for establishing a regulatory environment \nconducive  to  business  development.  FSPL  II  also  proposed  that  SBV  issue  a  regulation  allowing  leasing \ncompanies to provide both finance and operating leases. Guidelines were also issued on registration of and \ninformation on finance-leased assets. These provide details of procedures for registration at the National Office for \nRegistration of Secured Transactions by financial leasing companies. \n ", "4   \n1.  Preparing Subprogram II \na.  Refining the SDPL Framework for Subprogram II \n13.  Subprogram  II  will  be  refined  by  (i)  assessing  the  progress  of  subprogram  I \nimplementation and the lessons learned; (ii) reflecting the changes in the policy environment of \nthe  SME  sector  since  the  initiation  of  the  SDPL;  and  (iii)  forging  consensus  with  the \nGovernment and stakeholders on the design of subprogram II. Major changes that may need \nto be reflected include the Unified Commercial Enterprise Law and the Common Investment \nLaw, which were promulgated by the National Assembly in 2005. Considerable efforts will be \nneeded by the Government to implement these laws effectively.   \n \nb.  Designing an Investment Component for Leasing Industry \nDevelopment \n14.  Although the leasing industry in Viet Nam is still underdeveloped, demand for medium-\nterm financing (of which leasing is an attractive part, especially for smaller companies) is \nexpected to grow. Subprogram II originally contained a provision for an investment component \nto provide long-term funding to leasing companies in Viet Nam to help them meet strong \ndemand  for  longer-term  leasing  products  from  SMEs  and  to  help  the  leasing  companies \ndiversify their funding base and target more clients. To facilitate this process, this TA will identify \nthe best design for the investment component and build on current activities of the SBV and \nothers.  \n \n2.  Capacity Building for Subprogram II Implementation \n15.  The second phase of the TA will support the implementation of subprogram II. The TA is \nbased on the policy framework of the program cluster, as approved in 2004. The major areas \ninclude (i) implementation of the business registration and licensing plans; (ii) implementation of \nthe  SME  development  action  program  through  stakeholder  coordination;  (iii)  training  and \nmaintenance of financial infrastructure, including accounting, land use access, and secured \ntransactions;  and  (iv) improvements  to  the  institutional  and  legal  framework  for  technical \nstandards. The TA also adds components to subprogram II, related to the new UEL and CIL for \nthe program component, and to the leasing industry development for the project component. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n16.  The TA will fund consultants with expertise in the SME sector and related areas. They \nwill conduct in-depth consultations with the Government and private sector stakeholders. A \nconsultative approach will include a number of round table discussions and workshops on skill \nand knowledge transfer. ADB will monitor the process closely to ensure the quality of outputs, \nincluding training. \n \n17.  The consultants will prepare a detailed work plan before their services start. The plan will \ninclude a timetable for deliverables defined under each component of the TA. All reports will be \nreviewed  by  the  Executing  Agency,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  Investment  (MPI);  the \nimplementing agencies (IAs); and ADB. Tripartite meetings will be held before the draft final \nreports are finalized. The final report, incorporating comments from MPI, IAs, and ADB, will be \nsubmitted when they complete their services.  \n \n ", "5 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The TA is estimated to cost a total of $750,000 equivalent, comprising $528,000 in \nforeign exchange and $222,000 equivalent in local currency. The Government has asked ADB \nto  finance  $528,000  equivalent  to  cover  the  entire  foreign  exchange  cost  and  $72,000 \nequivalent of the local currency costs ($600,000 in total). ADB will provide $600,000 to finance \nthe TA on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the \nremaining $150,000 equivalent of the local currency costs, including provision of counterpart \nstaff, office space, administrative services, and physical facilities. The Government has been \nadvised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. The cost \nestimates and financing plan is in Appendix 3.6 \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  To facilitate implementation of the TA, the SDPL\u2019s program steering committee will \noversee its implementation. The committee is headed by the vice minister of MPI, the Executing \nAgency. The IAs include the Ministry of Finance, SBV (which will be the lead IA on the leasing \ncomponent),  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology,  Ministry  of  Natural  Resources  and \nEnvironment (General Department of Land Management). The TA will be implemented over 12 \nmonths from May 2006 to May 2007 and will require seven international consultants (19 person-\nmonths total) and seven domestic consultants (26 person-months total) on an intermittent basis. \nThe consultant team will produce an inception report, two interim reports, and a draft final report, \neach of which will be discussed during the tripartite meetings.   \n \n20.  Because of the diverse skill requirements of the TA, the consultants will be recruited as \nindividuals,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other \narrangements satisfactory to ADB for the selection and engagement of domestic consultants. \nProcurement  under  the  TA  will  be  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement. \nEquipment to be purchased under the TA includes a computer and other office equipment, \nwhich will be disposed of according to ADB guidelines after completion of the TA.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Viet Nam for preparing the SME Development Program\u2014Subprogram II, \nand hereby reports this action to the Board. \n                                                 \n6  The project cost estimates and their presentation in this paper were negotiated with the Government and finally \nagreed in the TA memorandum of understanding with the Government prior to the issuance of the staff instructions \non \u201cCost Sharing and Eligibility of Expenditures for Asian Development Bank Financing\u201d.

The TA is \nexpected to formulate a program which will contribute towards increasing private enterprises\u2019 contribution to economic \ngrowth, employment generation, and poverty reduction. This will be achieved by creating a more conducive business \nenvironment  by  (i)  improving  the  commercial  sector  legal  framework,  (ii)  minimizing  regulatory  requirements, \n(iii) enhancing access to finance, and (iv) liberalizing trade and investment regimes. It is expected that the TA and the \nensuing program will, in the medium to long term, have significant impact on increasing opportunities for employment, \nand reduce the incidence of poverty. To the extent possible, the TA will ensure that the process of policy formulation \nand implementation follow the Government\u2019s goal to foster participation, and promote social inclusion and gender-\nresponsiveness in pursuing its poverty reduction efforts.  \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe  Government\u2019s  Socio-Economic  Plan  and  other  documents  stress  the  reduction  of  poverty  through  strong \neconomic growth. ADB has played an active role in the strategy formulation process through various initiatives, and \nemphasizes regional economic integration, market-based development initiatives, human resource development, and \nsustainable social and environmental management. In line with the priorities set forth in the strategy, the technical \nassistance (TA) aims to address some of the structural policy and legal and regulatory impediments to SME and \nprivate  sector  development.  Identified  priorities  include  the  following:  (i)  enhancing  the  legal  and  regulatory \nenvironment for SMEs; (ii) enhancing private enterprises\u2019 access to finance; (iii) facilitating foreign investment and \ntrade; and (iv) promoting public\u2013private partnership. \n  \nThe establishment of transparent, market-friendly, socially inclusive and, to the extent possible, gender-responsive \nbusiness practices is also likely to promote private sector confidence and contribute to the establishment of pro-poor \ngovernance structures. The impacts of the TA on economic growth and employment generation are assessed to be \nsignificantly positive. No adverse impact requiring mitigating measures was identified.  \n \nC.
