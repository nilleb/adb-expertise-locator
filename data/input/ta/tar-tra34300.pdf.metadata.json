INTRODUCTION\n1.  The Asian Development Bank has conducted an orientation program for government\nofficials from selected developing member countries (DMCs) annually since 1989, except in\n1996.1 The program has provided the participants with carefully designed in-house training\ninvolving (i) exposure to ADB policies and procedures, (ii) introduction to selected aspects of\ndevelopment planning, (iii) discussion of project management skills, and (iv) awareness of\nADB's  changing  role.  The  participants  were  generally  midlevel  government  officials  with\nexperience in managing development work.. This technical assistance (TA) will meet the costs\nof continuing the program for the three years from 2000 to 2002.2  The TA framework is\npresented in Appendix 1.\nII.  BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE\n2.  The program helps participants upgrade their skills, particularly in development planning,\nand manage development activities in their countries. It provides an opportunity for participants\nto become more familiar with ADB policies and procedures, and ADB\u2019s activities in the DMCs.\nThe program also promotes goodwill between ADB and participating DMCs.  A total of 168\nparticipants  from  32  DMCs  have  benefited  from  the  Program:  (Appendix  2  presents  the\ndistribution of participants by year and country).\n3.  Other programs available for officials of DMCs and staff of executing agencies are\nscheduled to impart skills related to economic analysis and project management. The scope,\ncoverage, and duration of such programs are different from that proposed in this report.\n4.  Participants in the 1999 program were surveyed regarding the program's merits. They\nnoted that the concept was fundamentally sound, and that they returned to their countries with a\nbetter understanding of ADB\u2019s operations and policies. They also interacted closely with ADB\nstaff who are working with their countries. A parallel and useful outcome of the program was\nthat participants learned about other countries and culture; an experience that is of value\nparticularly  to  participants  engaged  in  regional  economic  cooperation  activities.  An  alumni\nprogram has been established to strengthen the network of participants and ADB. The program\nparticipants will regularly receive the ADB Review and an updated alumni directory.\n5.  The  survey  suggested  several  areas  that  can  be  improved.  To  maximize  the\nunderstanding of the participants, learning will be more interactive and more opportunities will\nbe available to meet with ADB staff. To assure that the program is tailored to the needs of the\nparticipants, they may be involved in program design at an earlier stage than was the case in\nthe past.\n                                                \n1  The title Orientation Program replaced the title Special Secondment Scheme, which was used from 1990 to 1995.\n2 The TA was listed in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 May 2000.", "2\nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Objectives\n6. The objectives of the 2000-2002 program are to :\n(i)  increase familiarity of counterpart officials with ADB\u2019s policies, procedures, and\noperations;\n(ii)  improve participants\u2019 skills in planning and managing development activities;\n(iii)  enhance the relationship between ADB and the DMC counterpart agencies; and\n(iv)  enhance the DMCs\u2019 understanding of ADB's changing role.\nB. Scope\n7.  The program, which will be held annually over the three years from 2000 to 2002, will\nsupport approximately 25 participants each year from selected DMCs for up to three weeks at\nADB headquarters.  Participants will be from organizations in DMCs that borrow from ADB\nand/or are acting as counterparts to ADB in implementing ADB-financed projects and programs.\nEach of the selected DMCs will be invited to send one official for the Orientation Program. The\nnominees should be government officials at the level of director or deputy director of a division\n(or equivalent), preferably from planning agencies, the ministry of finance, or other central\nministries. All participants must have a working knowledge of English.\n8.  Based on previous success, the current program will have several sets of learning\nopportunities taking into account the needs of the participants and the accommodative capacity\nof the various ADB departments and offices.\n9.  Briefing sessions on ADB\u2019s major operational policies and procedures will include (i) an\nintroduction to ADB strategies and the new role for ADB (6 days), (ii) procurement operations\n(1.5  days),  (iii)  consulting  services  (1  day),  (iv)  disbursement  operations  (1.5  days),  (v)\nconsultation with departments (3 days), and (vi) visits to an international organization and ADB\nproject sites.\n10.  The sessions will include several case studies dealing with such issues as consultant\nselection and will be based on ADB\u2019s day-to-day experiences.  The Capacity Building Unit of the\nStrategy and Policy Department will be closely consulted in designing the program to contribute\nto the capacity- building component.\n11.  In addition to the regular sessions, the participants may visit counterpart divisions so\nthey can discuss issues and deepen their understanding of ADB\u2019s operations. The Human\nResources Division (BPHR) will arrange meetings in cooperation with the divisions concerned.\n12.  To increase the learning impact, the participants will be encouraged to become involved\nin the program before the meetings start.  Issues of interest in ADB\u2019s operations and the\nexpectations  of  the  participants  will  be  incorporated  into  the  course  content,  design,  and\ndelivery.  Operational  departments  are  expected  to  play  an  important  role  in  disseminating\ninformation about the latest policy developments to the participants.", "3\n13.  During  the  program,  ADB  will  organize  study  tours  so  participants  can  visit  other\ninternational organizations operating in the Philippines, such as the International Rice Research\nInstitute, and ADB-financed projects being implemented in the Philippines.\nC. Cost Estimates and Financing Plan\n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $750,000 (Appendix 3). The TA will be financed\nby ADB on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program and will provide round-trip airfare\n(economy class), accommodation, and per diem for each participant. The participating DMC\ngovernments will grant leaves of absence to their participants in the training program and\ncontinue to pay their salaries during the program.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n15.  ADB will be assisted in implementing the TA by an international consultant for six\nperson-weeks  for  each  orientation  program.  The  consultant  must  be  knowledgeable  about\nADB\u2019s operations, procedures, and organization, and will organize the briefing sessions in\ncoordination with the departments/offices concerned (with proper balance between the projects\nand  programs  departments),  prepare  the  case  studies,  and  arrange  the  details  of  the\nparticipants\u2019 assignments with their counterpart divisions. Outline terms of reference for the\nconsultant are attached as Appendix 4. The consultant will be selected in accordance with\nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.  The administrative, secretarial services, and\nlogistical arrangements will be provided by a seminar assistant (locally recruited consultant) who\nwill be hired for 2 person-months.\n16.  The  Orientation  Program  will  commence  in  November  each  year.  ADB  will  be  the\nExecuting  Agency  and  BPHR  will  administer  the  TA  in  close  consultation  with  concerned\noperational departments/offices within ADB. Participants will be selected by BPHR in close\nconsultation with the counterpart divisions mainly in operational departments. The estimated\ncompletion date is December 2002.\n17. At the end of the program, participants will evaluate the usefulness of the course, and\nthe logistical and administrative arrangements. Their feedback will help BPHR improve the\nprogram for the following year.\nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION\n18. The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the\nprovision of technical assistance, on a grant basis, in an amount not exceeding the equivalent of\n$750,000 for the purpose of 2000-2002 Orientation Program for Officials of ADB\u2019s Developing\nMember Countries and hereby reports such action to the Board.", "4\nAppendix 1, Page 1\nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FRAMEWORK\nDesign Summary Project Targets Project Monitoring Risks/Assumptions\nMechanisms\n1.
