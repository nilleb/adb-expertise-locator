Justification \n1.  The Government of Indonesia requested for ADB\u2019s assistance to prepare the Periodic \nFinancing  Request  2  (PFR  2)  of  the  Integrated  Citarum  Water  Resources  Management \nInvestment  Program,  for  addressing  the  shortage  of  water  supply  in  Bandung  and  its \nsurrounding areas and conserving the upper watershed.  \n \n2.  The  Citarum  river  basin  located  in  the  province  of  West  Java  is  socially  and \neconomically the most important river basin in Indonesia. The basin provides around 80% of the \nsurface water supply to the capital city of Jakarta and surrounding areas supporting a population \nof about 30 million and contributing 20% of the country\u2019s industrial outputs. In addition, the river \nfed irrigation schemes produce 5% of the country\u2019s rice production. Sustainable management of \nthe surface and ground water in the river basin is, therefore, critical to the country\u2019s economic \ndevelopment and food security. Furthermore, water quality degradation is compromising public \nhealth and livelihoods, particularly of the rural and urban poor, and incurs additional economic \nand financial costs related to the delivery of clean and reliable water supplies. \n \n3.  Following  the  enactment  of  the  Water  Law  in  2004,  the  Government  adopted  an \nintegrated approach to improving land and water management in the Citarum river basin, for \nwhich it requested ADB\u2019s technical assistance (TA) in 2006. The TA helped develop a strategic \nintegrated water resources management (IWRM) roadmap for the basin management with a \nshared vision, which is \u201cthe government and communities working together for clean, healthy \nand productive watersheds and rivers, bringing sustainable benefits to all people of the Citarum \nRiver Basin across Citarum basin stakeholders\u201d.  \n \n4.  In 2008, ADB approved a Multitranche Financing Facility (MFF) not exceeding $500 \nmillion equivalent for the Integrated Citarum Water Resources Investment Program (Investment \nProgram).1 The expected outcome of the Investment Program is improved and integrated water \nresources management in the Citarum river basin. The Investment Program comprises of the \nfollowing interventions, namely: (i) establishing good IWRM institutions and effective planning \nwith stakeholder participation; (ii) introducing effective planning, implementation and operation \nand maintenance of water resource infrastructure; (iii) establishing and protecting water rights \nand water allocation among competing uses and users; (iv) introducing environmental protection \nand  environmental  enhancement;  (v)  improving  disaster  management;  (vi)  empowering \ncommunities in water management; and (vii) enhancing data collection and decision support for \nwater resources management. \n \n5.  ADB also approved in 2008 the PFR 1 under the MFF for (i) effective stakeholder \ncoordination for IWRM roadmap management in the Citarum river basin; (ii) water resources \ndevelopment  and  management,  including  (a)  rehabilitation  of  the  West  Tarum  canal,  (b) \nimproved land and water management, (c) support community driven initiatives for improved \nwater supply and sanitation, and (d) detailed engineering design for upgrading Bandung water \n                                                 \n1  $470 million equivalent from ADB's ordinary capital resources (OCR) and Special Drawing Rights 20.162 million \nequivalent to $30 million from Asian Development Fund (ADF). ", "2 \n \nsources;  and  (iii)  environment  protection.2 ADB  subsequently  approved  administration  of  a \n$3.75 million Global Environmental Facility (GEF) grant3 to support the PFR 1 activities.4  \n \n6.  Although there were initial delays in PFR 1 implementation because of late mobilization \nof  the  consultants,  project  implementation  is currently  on  track  for most  components.  The \nprogress has been satisfactory in the establishment of Project Implementation Units (PIUs) and \nthe  fielding  of  TA  and  loan  consultants.  This  has  been  facilitated  by  strong  support  from \nIndonesia Resident Mission and ADB water sector team. The lessons learned include that the \nproject administration in the country office could expedite project implementation and promptly \naddress critical implementation issues including resettlement.     \n \n7.  While PFR 1 implementation is progressing to strengthen basin wide water governance \nand management capacity, demand and competition for Citarum water resources has increased \nsignificantly  over  the  past  20  years.  Watershed  degradation,  rapid  urbanization  and \nindustrialization in the area and slow development of surface water sources have created an \noverdependence on groundwater as a primary source of water. Consequently, the rate of water \nextraction from local aquifers significantly exceeds recharge rates, with water tables declining at \nmore than 1 meter a year in some places. This has led to acute water stress and depletion of \naquifers in major urban areas such as Bandung. Current water supply capacity in the Bandung \nand its surrounding area is only 3,800 liters per second (lps) compared to the requirements of \n5,100 lps in 2010.5 Due to rapid urbanization, its population is expected to increase from 8.0 \nmillion in 2010 to 9.5 million and water supply demand to 9,200 lps by 2018. Therefore, the \ncurrent  and  emerging  acute  water  supply  shortage  in  the  area  needs  to  be  addressed \nexpeditiously.   \n \n8.  Moreover, the hydrologic flow regime in the Citarum river basin on which Bandung water \nsupply depends has been also adversely affected by land degradation, notably the loss of forest \ncover  and  unsustainable  farming  practices  on  steep  slopes  in  the  upper  catchments.  The \ndegraded catchments have reduced capacity to capture rainwater, resulting in high peak flows \nduring the rainy season causing downstream flooding and high soil erosion rates. It is estimated \nthat 25% of the basin area has erosion rates in excess of 210 tons per ha per year.  \n \n9.  To effectively address the problems of degrading watershed and acute water stress and \ndepletion of aquifers in Bandung and its surrounding areas, the Government requested ADB in \n2010 to support the preparation of PFR 2 for financing under the Investment Program. PFR 2 \nwill  improve  Bandung  water  supply  by  developing  adequate  surface  water  resources  and \nproviding raw water to the provincial water supply companies (PDAMs), thereby reducing the \ndependence and overexploitation of groundwater. It will also address the upper watershed \ndegradation. The basic project information is presented in Appendix 1.  \n \n10.  PFR 2 will complement, and coordinate with, the World Bank support to the Directorate \nGeneral  of  Human  Settlement  (DGHS),  Ministry  of  Public  Works  and  related  government \nagencies. ADB and the World Bank have agreed on collaboration mechanisms for (i) solid \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2008.

POVERTY ISSUES\nA.  Links to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy \nThe Government of Indonesia supports the water resources sector as a priority in the Medium-term Development Plan \n(RPJMN) for 2010-2014 and the project as a priority in the Country Partnership Strategy and Indonesia Country \nOperations Business Plan for 2011-2013. The sector analysis in the RPJMN indicates that the water resources are \nunder serious threat because of declining availability of water resources due to high land conversion, water pollution, \nexcessive exploitation of ground water, and climate change impact. Raw water supply service is neither optimal nor \nequitable due to the declining flow of water sources and high rate of sedimentation in the river basin. On the other \nhand, the demand of raw water supply is higher due to rapid population growth, and inefficient pattern of water \nutilization. The development of irrigation management has not yet been optimized. So far only 11% of irrigated area \nrelies on the availability of water from reservoir, the rest relies on river.  \n \nThe country\u2019s water resources development strategy aims to improving the welfare of society and contributes to \npoverty reduction efforts. The number of poor people in Indonesia is 31 million (13%) and most of them (20 million, \n64%) live in rural area. The target of poverty reduction in the RPJMN is to reduce the poverty to 10% by 2014. The \nGovernment\u2019s strategy of the poverty reduction is to improve the economic growth in the sectors that have significant \nimpact in achieving MDGs. These include improvement of agricultural productivity and increased access of poor \npeople to water supply for domestic and agriculture needs, which can be possible in the Citarum river basin. \n   \nThe project focusing on Bandung and its surrounding area is in line with the Government of Indonesia\u2019s strategies for \nwater resources development and poverty reduction.  It is also in line with ADB Country Partnership Strategy (2011-\n2013 scheduled for approval in 2011) which focuses on ADB\u2019s role in advancing the social development agenda to \nempower the poor in order to benefit from growth. The Project is also supporting ADB Water for All policy. The project \nwill benefit general population in the project area including many of those who are under the poverty line. \n \nB.

How do the poor and the socially excluded benefit \nfrom the project? \nPFR 2 will focus on Bandung and its surrounding areas. Total current population is 8.0 million, and it is projected as \n9.5 million in 2018, and 11.8 million in 2030. In parallel with the population increase, the needs for raw water are \nexpected to increase significantly up to 9,200 liters/second by 2018. The project will improve health and livelihoods of \n8 million people in Bandung and its surrounding area, including the poor and the socially excluded due to better water \nsupply for domestic need.
