The plan covered a broad range of areas in formal and informal \neducation including skills development. In April 2004, the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum in \ntheir Auckland Declaration endorsed the development of a Pacific Plan for \u201cdeeper and broader\u201d \nregional cooperation. The Pacific Plan emphasizes the importance of strengthening vocational and \ntechnical training and its links with the labor market.1 Similarly, one of the strategic objectives of the \nAsian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  education and  training  sector strategy  in  the  Pacific2  is to \nformulate education strategies that are relevant and responsive to national development objectives \nand client needs. Under this objective, ADB identified the need for implementing regional technical \nassistance (TA) for the Pacific developing member countries (PDMCs) in collaboration with Pacific \nIslands Forum Secretariat (PIFS).3 The TA is conceptualized in the context of the FBEAP, the \nPacific Plan, and ADB\u2019s education and training sector strategies for the Pacific. ADB and PIFS \nreached an understanding on the TA justification, objectives, scope, cost estimates, financing plan, \nimplementation arrangements, and terms of reference for consultants to implement the TA in \npartnership. The TA was approved by the Ministers of Education of the Pacific Islands Forum \nduring a meeting on 23\u201324 May, in Apia, Samoa. The TA design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  A nation\u2019s economy runs on the knowledge and skills of its people. The requirements for \nskills evolve with external investment, technological advances, and globalization. To keep pace \nwith  changes,  people  need  to  acquire  skills  to  be  productive  and  earn  a  living.  Education \ndevelopment in the Pacific, as in other developing countries, cannot be limited to basic education. \nAs countries develop and the demand for people with more advanced skills expands, the returns to \nhigher levels of education increase. Students that complete basic education will want to continue \ntheir general education in upper secondary schools. Others want to enter technical and vocational \nprograms.  But  all  should  be  prepared  to  pursue  education  throughout  their  working  life, and \ncountries need to facilitate skills formation through a variety of ways so as to raise productivity and \nincomes. \n3.  The Pacific region boasts some skills training exemplars, graduates of which are in high \nnational and international demand. However, much of the public investment in skills development4 \nhas been through pre-employment programs for youth who completed basic education and did not \ncontinue their general education, or through the introduction of vocational subjects in general \nsecondary education programs.5 The results of such programs have been generally disappointing. \nThey have in many cases been driven by supply rather than demand, costly, difficult to implement, \nand unresponsive to changing labor market demands. Neither have they helped reduce youth \nunemployment. They are often inappropriate in a rapidly changing economic environment that is \ntechnology driven and places a premium on higher order cognitive skills. In fact, the content of \nskills  training  is  evolving  dramatically.  Some  skills,  such  as  typing  and  information  and \ncommunication technology (ICT) literacy, have become part of general education. Other general \n                                                 \n1  Pacific Islands Forum. 2004. Auckland Declaration. \n2  ADB. 2005. Better Learning, Better Future: Education and Training Sector Strategy for the Pacific.  Manila.  \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 4 July 2005. \n4  It should be noted that the terms, technical and vocational training (TVET) and skills development in this report are \ndefined as follows: \u201cSkills development\u201d is the acquisition of the practical competencies, know-how, and attitudes \nnecessary to perform a trade or occupation in the labor market. \u201cTVET\u201d is technical, vocational education, and training, \ni.e., training supply. These terms are used interchangeably in this paper. \n5  Comprehensive statistics are lacking on the scope of skills provision. According to UNESCO, data on the proportion of \nsecondary students enrolled in vocational courses are available only for four countries: Fiji (3%), Papua New Guinea \n(PNG, 15%), Tonga (14%), and Vanuatu (10%).  No data are available on enrollments in nonformal skills development. \nOne of the purposes of the proposed TA is to assemble such statistics. ", "2   \nskills, such as mastery of English, have become an entry requirement for specific jobs (e.g., in call \ncenters). Communication skills, problem-solving ability, learning capacity, and personal attributes \nsuch as willingness to adapt and accept change are often at a premium in modern job markets. \nThey are crucial for those PDMCs where emigration to industrialized countries is a realistic option \nfor many. In addition, skills training for self-employment and the informal economy will be important \nfor  future  human  resources  development.  Skills  development,  therefore,  suffers  from  five \nfundamental problems: supply-demand imbalances, inequity, low quality of training, management \nweaknesses, and inefficient use of resources. \n4.  Supply and Demand Imbalance. The challenge for technical-vocational education and \ntraining (TVET) is to adjust continuously to changes in the external economic environment. Taken \nas a whole, provision of TVET in the region has been supply\u2013 rather than demand-driven, resulting \nin a mismatch between available human resources and employment opportunities. Training often \ntends to perpetuate itself in isolation of market forces, leading to market saturation. Graduate \nunemployment manifests this imbalance. Moreover, skills shortages have occurred as a result of \nrapid changes in technology and the requirements of globalization. Emigration has exacerbated \nshortages in critical occupations in the Pacific region, as countries lose some of their most skilled \npeople to more developed countries. The greatest potential for employment generation in the \nPacific tends to be in small manufacturing, tourism, agriculture, and fisheries, but training systems \nhave been slow to respond with relevant programs. In view of these issues, the regional study will \nanalyze ways to build greater flexibility into training systems, to bring training supply into closer \nbalance with changing market demands, and to gear up training outputs to replace critical skills lost \nthrough emigration.  \n5.  Youth unemployment is a major concern for Pacific governments. Thousands of youth enter \nthe job market annually, without skills needed for work in the labor market. Most of them will have \nto find work in the informal or semisubsistence sector. However, few have entrepreneurship skills \nor the opportunity for mentoring, microcredit, and marketing assistance. The study will examine \nhow training for self-employment and entrepreneurship can be promoted. More broadly, the study \nwill review lessons from earlier efforts at training for the informal sector and will recommend ways \nto  improve  incomes  in  the  informal  sector.  It  will  evaluate  past  attempts  at  reducing  youth \nunemployment through training, many of which have failed, and draw lessons for good practice. \n6.  A perennial issue in TVET is the attempt to add vocational classes to general secondary \neducation as a means to make the graduates better prepared to join the labor force. A common \nsolution proposed is the provision of vocational subjects at the secondary level. International \nexperience suggests, however, that\u2014especially when done too early in development when the \nmodern industrial sector is small\u2014the provision is often costly and ineffective and diverts time from \npreparation in fundamental skills, like language and mathematics. The study will review current \npolicies and experiences in the region on diversification of general education, and will recommend \nalternative, low-cost ways to make secondary education better linked to job markets.  \n7.  Inequity in Training Provision. Access to skills tends to be skewed for three groups: the \npoor, girls, and people with disabilities. The poorest segments of the population often are unable to \nparticipate in skills development because they drop out of general education early and cannot \nafford the direct and indirect costs. Females lack access to training in terms of enrollments6 and, as \na result of gender stereotyping, in choice of vocation once enrolled. The lack of access to training \nis also a major factor explaining high poverty levels among Pacific people with disabilities. In view \nof the importance of equitable access, the TA will (i) examine the socioeconomic barriers to \ntraining, (ii) incorporate systematic gender analysis to ensure gender-responsive outcomes, and \n(iii) make explicit reference to the training needs of people with disabilities. \n                                                 \n6  For example, females comprise only 26% of students enrolled in secondary vocational institutions in PNG and only \n38% in Fiji (UNESCO \u2013 EFA Global Monitoring Report 2005). ", "      3\n8.  Low  Quality  of  Training.  Quality  of  training  stems  from  well-defined  occupational \nstandards, emphasis on competencies, well-trained instructors, and well-equipped institutions. The \nPacific region already boasts of several institutions with highly- regarded quality. However, training \nquality varies and generally suffers a lack of critical inputs. Supplies of well-trained instructors are \noften  missing.  The  study  will,  among  others,  examine  output  quality,  analyze  the  causes  of \nweaknesses, and recommend strategies to build training quality within existing constraints.  \n9.  Management Weaknesses. Management of skills development must be sufficiently nimble \nto respond to frequent changes in the job market. Long decision-making circuits in centralized \nsystems  militate  against  dynamic  relations  with  the  labor  market  at  the  institution  level.  The \nregional study will investigate the degree of devolution of authority to training institutions so they \ncan link their programs to local markets and raise needed resources. One of the clear lessons from \nTVET worldwide is that governments cannot do it alone. Partnerships must be forged with the \nprivate sector, with nongovernment organizations and with private training providers. Coordination \nof efforts is required to ensure that gaps are filled and duplication avoided. The regional study will \nassess  to  what  extent  such  collaborative  arrangements  have  been  established  and  used \neffectively. \n10.  Inefficient Use of Resources. A final challenge is to find extra resources to finance \nneeded skills development. Training is costly, on average 10 times as expensive as general \neducation  of  the  same  duration.  Smaller  teaching  groups  and  the  costs  of  equipment  and \nconsumable supplies account for most of the difference. Costs per trainee make it difficult to \nexpand skills provision when not all age-eligible children are yet enrolled in basic education and \nwhen  budgetary  expenditures  are  pushing  against  a  ceiling.  These  issues  underscore  the \nimportance of making efficient use of current expenditures on skills development. Unfortunately, \nthe geography of the region, including such factors as low population density and vast distances, \noften prevents efficiency. One way to achieve economies of scale in small countries can be the \njudicious use of ICT. The study will examine experiences to date (e.g., open and distance learning \nprovided  by  the  Fiji  and  Vanuatu  institutes  of  technology)  and  recommend  ways  that  ICT, \nfranchising, and other methods can provide quality skills training at reasonable costs. In addition, \ncountries  face  the  additional  challenge  of  mobilizing  funds  for  needed  expansion  and  quality \nimprovements.  The  study  will  assess  various  means  to  raise  additional  income  for  skills \ndevelopment  based  on  world-wide  experiences.  The  international  knowledge  base  in  skills \ndevelopment and TVET is much weaker than that for other areas of education. Therefore, regional \nanalysis  is  needed  to  identify  options  that  countries  can  consider  as  they  formulate  national \npolicies and investment programs.  \n11.  Regional Interest in Skills Development. Skills development is becoming a priority for the \nPacific countries as they progress toward meeting the millennium development goals for basic \neducation. The concern for skills formation is fueled partly by the surging numbers of youth who \nhave completed formal schooling yet lack skills that are useful in the labor market. Making TVET \nwork requires a realistic understanding of labor markets and the population to be trained and the \ngeneration of new approaches. In 2001, PIFS education ministers adopted an action plan designed \nto refocus education and TVET to support private sector needs for trained workers. The plan \nemphasizes, among others, the need to develop appropriate strategies for skills development. \nMore recently, Pacific leaders called for a plan that emphasizes the importance of strengthening \nvocational training and its links to the labor market, through the April 2004 Auckland Declaration. In \nMay 2005, the ministers endorsed ADB\u2019s proposed regional review of skills development. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE  \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The objective of the TA is to establish a more effective public and private investment in \nskills  development.  The  outcomes  will  be  a  set  of  strategies  for  skills  development  that  are ", "4   \nresponsive to emerging market demands of both the formal and informal sectors. The TA will \nsupport all 13 PDMC that are PIFS members.7 \n13.  The  outputs  of  the  TA  will  be  (i)  an  assessment  of  the  relationship  between  skills \ndevelopment and economic development, labor market demand and outward migration within the \nsample countries; (ii) policy options for skills development that governments of the PDMCs may \nwish to consider based on an in-depth analysis of issues and alternatives; (iii) an integrated, \nprioritized, and costed project design for regional skills development; and (iv) national-level project \nproposals encompassing pre-employment training, skills upgrading, and adult retraining. The TA \nwill include provision for consultation and dissemination workshops.   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.  The TA will be implemented through desk reviews, workshops, country studies, and special \nsurveys. First, literature and project impact (if available) reviews will be conducted for the region to \nassess the situation of skills and the TVET subsector of education. The aim is to consolidate and \nsummarize TVET activities and initiatives in the region. Examples of international good practices \nfrom other developing countries will also be reviewed. Second, a regional workshop will be held to \nagree on a common agenda of issues to be addressed and questions to be answered, and to \ndetermine the scope of the study. A second regional training workshop will be convened for all \ndomestic consultants to train them on data collection and situation analysis of the TVET. Third, the \nheart of the analysis will be country reviews and evaluations of the supply and demand for skills at \nvarious levels. Thirteen country desk studies will be prepared, followed by in-depth studies of up to \nsix representative countries that will result in project concept papers for future interventions.8 \nFourth, a few key surveys of original research on critical issues will be undertaken. They may \ninclude surveys of employers\u2019 views on training, tracer studies of graduates, and cost-effectiveness \nof different modes of skills formation. Fifth, analytical work will be synthesized in a report on issues \nand options for skills development. Sixth, a regional fully costed project design will be prepared.9 \nSeventh, a final regional workshop to discuss the results will be held after completing the analyses. \nFinally, the report, incorporating workshop outcomes, will be finalized and disseminated to policy \nmakers  as  they  formulate  national  policies  and  investment  programs  for  skills  development. \nDissemination will include a website incorporating thematic studies produced under the regional \nTA. \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $975,000 to be entirely financed on a grant basis by the Japan \nSpecial Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan \nare in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  PIFS will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will be responsible for overall study \nexecution and implementation. The TA will be implemented over 18 months from February 2006 to \nAugust 2007 under the leadership of the Social Policy Adviser of PIFS. PIFS capacity will be \nstrengthened by establishing a TA management unit (TAMU) under PIFS and appointing a project \nmanager and an administrative assistant in the TAMU. An advisory steering committee (SC) will be \nestablished, composed of members from the Secretariat of the Pacific Community (SPC), Pacific \nAssociation  of  Technical  and  Vocational  Education,  South  Pacific  Board  for  Educational \nAssessment,  Council  of  Pacific  Education,  University  of  the  South  Pacific,  Fiji  Institute  of \n                                                 \n7  Cook Islands, Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Papua New \nGuinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.  \n8  To be decided during implementation, but tentatively include Fiji Islands, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Papua New Guinea, \nSolomon Islands, Vanuatu,  and a consolidated analysis and/or  proposal for small island countries. \n9  The national-level project concept papers and regional project design will be considered for funding by national \ngovernments and external funding agencies.   ", "      5\nTechnology, Pacific Business Council, International Labor Organization, private sector, PIFS and \nADB. The TA team will be guided by the SC. The SC will oversee the work of the study, and \nprovide policy and strategic guidance, and inter-ministerial, inter-country, and inter-institutional \ncoordination. The SC will meet whenever necessary, but not less than once every quarter. It will (i) \nadvise on operational plans, as well as support budgets; (ii) provide overall policy and operational \nguidance in implementing the TA and advice on corrective action if needed; and (iii) suggest \nresolutions to pressing issues and conflicts that may emerge during TA implementation.  \n17.  The  TAMU,  headed  by  a  manager,  will  have  overall  responsibility  for  day-to-day \ncoordination and management of TA implementation, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of \nprogress.  The  manager  will  be  the  focal  point  of  contact  and  coordinate  all  implementation \nactivities. Specifically, the TAMU will (i) prepare operational plans; (ii) undertake procurement \nactivities;  (iii)  prepare  and  maintain  financial  records,  accounts,  and  statements;  (iv)  prepare \nquarterly progress reports including the midterm review report as well as the TA completion report; \n(v) organize Project M&E activities; (vi) help PIFS and ADB recruit consultants and coordinate the \nwork of the consultants; and (vii) liaise on project implementation matters through PIFS and ADB. \nThe project manager will directly report to and be supervised by PIFS social policy adviser. A team \nof four international consultants (19 person-months) and 14 domestic consultants including the \nproject manager (34.5 person-months)10 will be engaged by ADB to provide 53.5 person-months of \nconsulting services. The consultants will be individually selected in consultation with the PIFS and \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic and international consultants, and approved by ADB \nand PIFS. The domestic consultants will include 13 TVET experts. The international consultants \nwill  consist  of  a  team  leader  (8.5  person-months  who  will  be  selected  from  among  the  four \ninternational  experts),  economist/labor  market  analyst  and  costs  and  financing  (3.5  person-\nmonths); TVET specialist (3.5 person-months), informal sector and rural training specialist (3.5 \nperson-months.), and survey design and analysis expert (1.5 person-months). The team leader will \nsupervise the work of all consultants. Appendix 3 includes the draft terms of references for expert \nservices.    \n18.  PIFS will be responsible for supervision, coordinating, and guiding roles and will assist the \nProject Manager and international consultants with all aspects, including establishing liaison with \nconcerned agencies and institutions, and obtaining necessary data and information. The PIFS will \nprovide office space for the consultants. The study budget provides for a small amount of computer \nand communications equipment for PIFS. The equipment will be procured in accordance with \nADB\u2019s  Guidelines  for  Procurement,  and  will  be  kept  by  PIFS  on  project  completion.  The \nconsultants are expected to provide their own computers.   \nIII.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n19.  The  President,  acting  under  the  authority  delegated  by  the  Board,  has  approved  the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $975,000 on a grant basis for the \nImplementation of Pacific Education Strategy: Skills Development, and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board. \n                                                 \n10 They include a project manager and an administrative assistant.
