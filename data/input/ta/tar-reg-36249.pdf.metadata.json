INTRODUCTION \n1.  The Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) was established in July 1999 \nby the World Bank and the governments of Japan and the United Kingdom, with a mandate to \nassist developing countries to improve the quality of their infrastructure through private sector \ninvolvement. Assistance from PPIAF can facilitate private involvement in financing, ownership, \noperation,  rehabilitation,  maintenance,  or  management  of  eligible  infrastructure  services. \nEligible  infrastructure  services  are  roads,  ports,  airports,  railways,  electricity, \ntelecommunications,  solid  waste,  water  supply  and  sewerage,  and  gas  transmission  and \ndistribution.  \n \n2.  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) joined PPIAF in 2001 by donating funds to the trust \nfund  supporting  PPIAF  activities  (according  to  the  terms  of  the  agreement  between  ADB, \nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and International Development \nAssociation (IDA) for PPIAF Trust Fund, the PPIAF Program Charter, and the Implementation \nProcedures Governing Contributions from the Asian Development Bank for the Public-Private \nInfrastructure  Advisory  Facility,  all  entered  into  on  5  September  2001  [the  PPIAF  Trust \nDocuments]. The initial ADB contribution was $250,000. The proposed technical assitance (TA) \nof $500,000 represents a second cash contribution to the PPIAF Trust Fund. Through this Fund, \nADB can enhance its role in mobilizing private resources for infrastructure development in the \nregion.1 The TA framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Objectives and Organization. PPIAF has two objectives: (i) to channel to governments \nin developing countries technical assistance for strategies and measures to tap the full potential \nof  private  involvement  in  infrastructure;  and (ii)  to identify,  disseminate,  and  promote  best \npractices  on  matters  related  to  private  sector  involvement  in  infrastructure  in  developing \ncountries. \n \n4.  As a member, ADB is represented on the PPIAF Program Council (PC), which is made \nup of representatives of agencies that contribute resources. An independent Technical Advisory \nPanel, made up of leading international experts in different aspects of private provision of \ninfrastructure,  supports  the  PC.  A  Program  Management  Unit    (PMU)  manages  PPIAF  in \naccordance with a general strategy and the annual work programs approved by the PC. This \ngovernance structure is designed to ensure the quality of PPIAF activities and its accountability \nto participating agencies. As of June 2002, there were 12 members including ADB. The PC \nmeets once a year to review the strategic direction of the PPIAF program, its achievements, and \nits financing requirements. The World Bank acts as the PPIAF Trust Fund administrator. PPIAF \nhas established three field-based regional coordination offices (RCOs) to assist in executing the \nPPIAF work program in Nairobi, Kenya; Pretoria, South Africa; and Singapore. \n \n5.  Resources and Projects Approved. PPIAF\u2019s available resources are estimated at $18 \nmillion annually for the next 3 years. The main contributors are Canada, France, Germany, \nJapan,  Netherlands,  Norway,  Sweden,  Switzerland,  United  Kingdom,  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, and World Bank. From its inception in July 1999 to 30 June 2002, \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in June 2002. ", "2 \nPPIAF  had  received  422  requests  for  assistance  totaling  over  $122  million,  of  which  207 \namounting to $47.5 million had been approved. PPIAF was able to secure cofinancing of $19.6 \nmillion for the approved proposals. An earlier review of its activities showed that PPIAF was \nable to facilitate 29 private infrastructure investment transactions, drafting of 16 laws (including \nregulatory  legislation)  of  which  8  have  been  enacted,  establishment  of  nine  institutional \narrangements to facilitate pro-poor infrastructure, training of 1,200 government officials and \nregulators, and dissemination of best practices to about 6,000 people through attendance at \ninternational and regional conferences.  \n \n6.  PPIAF\u2019s FY2002 Program. Key features of the work trends in FY2002, which ended on \n30 June 2002, included (i) demand-driven approach to applications with interest generated via \nthe PC members\u2019 networks and proactive efforts of PPIAF\u2019s management team; (ii) sustained \nhigh demand for PPIAF funding, with PPIAF receiving 104 applications for a total amount of $25 \nmillion; (iii) uneven quality of applications with only 39% of the total value of applications or 45% \nof the total number of applications meeting the rigorous evaluation criteria set out in the PPIAF \nCharter; (iv) reasonable balance across sectors and regions notwithstanding the demand-driven \napproach; and (v) multisectoral and multicountry emphasis of applications, signaling a greater \nemphasis on adopting systematic approaches that allow the transfer of lessons and experience \nacross both sectors and regions. \n \n7.  Emerging Best-Practice Outputs. PPIAF has been proactive in pursuing the wide \ndissemination of frontier issues and best practices, including best practices for sector-based as \nwell as customized regional approaches.  Possible themes for emerging best practice outputs \ninclude  (i)  improving  infrastructure  provision  through  regional  integration  (ii)  ensuring \nenvironmentally  sustainable  public  private  infrastructure  (PPI)  development  (iii)  designing \neffective bidding procedures for PPI development (iv) supporting PPI in postconflict situations \nand (v) managing the transition to markets (Appendix 2). The best practices developed from \ncountry- or region-specific activities (e.g., Port and Highways Toolkits or Advisors Toolkit) are \navailable in the tools kits on the PPIAF web site. \n \n8.  Rationale for Continued ADB Membership in PPIAF. The TA will provide for ADB\u2019s \ncontinued involvement in PPIAF in FY2003. Through continued membership, ADB can further \nenhance  its  role  in  promoting  private  sector  development  of  infrastructure  in  the  region. \nMembership in PPIAF will allow ADB to leverage its resources to carry out critical studies on \nprivate sector and infrastructure development.  PPIAF funding for the following four projects was \napproved in FY2002: \n \n(i)  Indonesia.  Pekanbaru  Water  Regulatory  Study  ($75,000)  to  develop  the \nregulatory framework for water concessions in the province of Sumatra, which is \na precondition for the signing of the water concession agreement with the private \nsector. Project completed. \n(ii)  Regional. Framework for Financing Merchant Power Plants in Asia ($450,000). \nThe regional study will develop a framework for financing merchant power plants, \nwhich  are  power  facilities  without  fully  committed  long-term  power  purchase \nagreements. Project ongoing, consultants being selected. \n(iii)  Philippines.  Electricity  Regulatory  Statement  and  Capacity  Building  for  the \nEnergy Regulatory Commission ($320,000). Project approved/ongoing. \n(iv)  Private Sector Participation in the Solid Waste Management Sector in Metro \nManila ($75,000), which will provide support on solid waste management projects ", "    3 \nto the Office of the Presidential Adviser for Strategic Projects of the Government. \nProject approved/ ongoing.  \n(v)  Also approved was a regional workshop: Infrastructure Development \u2013 Private \nSolutions for the Poor: An Asian Perspective. The workshop was held at ADB \nheadquarters on 28\u201330 October 2002 with the aim of promoting PPI. \n \n9.  PPIAF activities in Asia are as follows: South Asia, $5.4 million or 11%; East Asia, $9.5 \nor 20%. Activities in Asia during 1 July 1999 \u2013 30 June 2002 totaled $47.5 million. \n \n10.  Other proposals that PPIAF is now considering follow: (i) development of a forward-\nlooking aviation sector policy and regulatory framework in Mongolia; (ii) the promotion of private \nsector investment in railways in Asia; (iii) the development of proforma licenses and regulatory \nstatements for the electricity market in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC); and (iv) private \nsector participation (PSP) in Indonesia Ports. \n \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n11.  In pursuit of ADB\u2019s overarching objective to reduce poverty in the developing member \ncountries (DMCs) through sustainable economic development, the TA aims to support PPIAF in \nfacilitating greater PSP in infrastructure, which is in accordance with ADB\u2019s private sector \ndevelopment strategy (PSDS). The TA will allow ADB to continue to be an active member of \nPPIAF and to undertake and access studies on PSP in infrastructure projects conducted under \nPPIAF. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA contribution will enable ADB to initiate and carry out important studies and \nsponsor workshops and other activities that will promote private sector development in its \nDMCs. Among the outputs and specific deliverables are studies and activities that will involve (i) \nframing infrastructure development strategies that will guide DMC governments on options for \nexpanding private sector involvement in infrastructure; (ii) building consensus for appropriate \npolicy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms  through  seminars,  workshops,  study  tours,  and \npublic awareness campaigns; (iii) designing and implementing specific policy, regulatory, and \ninstitutional reforms to promote private sector involvement in infrastructure; (iv) supporting the \ndesign  and  implementation  of  pioneering  projects  and  transactions;  (v) building  the \ngovernment\u2019s  capacity  to  design  and  execute  private  infrastructure  arrangements  and  to \nregulate  private  service  providers;  and  (vi)  knowledge-building:  documentation  and \ndissemination of best practices in infrastructure development.  \n \n13.  ADB\u2019s  continued  membership  in  PPIAF  will  provide  additional  benefits  from  ADB\u2019s \nresources to implement activities that will promote private sector development in DMCs. Among \nthese benefits are (i) infrastructure development studies and best practices for use by ADB staff \nin their work to promote private involvement in public infrastructure; (ii) consensus building in \nDMC  line  agencies  to  institute  policy,  regulatory,  and  institutional  reforms  in  infrastructure \nsectors that will facilitate private sector involvement; (iii) building up the government\u2019s capacity \nto promote private sector development and implement private sector infrastructure projects in ", "4 \nDMCs; and (iv) identifying barriers to private sector involvement in infrastructure and providing \nsolutions to eliminate those barriers. \n \n14.   The TA will help meet the cost of consulting services recruited by PPIAF in undertaking \nTA  activities  designed  to  encourage  PSP  in  infrastructure,  and  creation  of  the  enabling \nenvironment for public-private partnerships. Through its membership in the PC, ADB will have \nsubstantial influence over the selection of project activities it wants to finance. In most cases \nthese project activities will further the poverty reduction objectives of ADB and will generally \ncomplement the studies proposed by ADB in its PSDS. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  ADB  will  contribute  $500,000  to  PPIAF,  which  will  be  used  to  finance  consulting \nservices. The TA will be financed on a grant basis from the ADB-funded TA Program. The \nincrease from the $250,000 grant in FY2002 to $500,000 in FY2003 reflects the increase in the \nnumber and volume of projects funded under PPIAF. Disbursements against the trust fund \naccount will have the prior approval of the ADB-designated task manager. The TA will be \nimplemented from December 2002 to June 2003. The contribution to the PPIAF Trust Fund will \ncover the period 1 July 2002 \u2013 30 June 2003. ADB\u2019s contributions will be provided only after \nsuccessful  discussion  and  signing  of  the  letter  of  agreement  between  the  trust  fund \nadministrator (The World Bank) and ADB for the period covered. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  The implementation arrangements for ADB\u2019s involvement in PPIAF are set forth in and \ngoverned  by  the  PPIAF  Trust  Documents.  These  arrangements  are  summarized  here  for \nconvenience (Appendix 3). \n \n17.  Governance and Organizational Structure. The PC consists of one representative \nfrom each contributor to PPIAF and is responsible for defining PPIAF policies and strategies, \napproving  the  indicative  annual  work  program  and  financial  plan,  and  reviewing  PPIAF \nperformance. The PC generally meets once a year. The Technical Advisory Panel, composed of \nup to six independent experts in matters related to private involvement in infrastructure in \ndeveloping countries, ensures the quality and relevance of PPIAF-financed activities. The PMU \nis responsible for the day-to-day operations of PPIAF in the pursuit of its mandate. The PMU \nreports to PC at least quarterly through the PC chair. The Vice-President for Private Sector \nDevelopment and Infrastructure of the World Bank chairs the PC. \n \n18.  PPIAF Products, Eligibility, and Approval Criteria. While countries eligible to receive \nPPIAF assistance in general are those in the List of Aid Recipients of the Organization for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee, only \nmember countries of ADB in the Asia and Pacific region will be eligible to receive assistance \nfrom  the  ADB  TA  grant  as  required  by  the  PPIAF  Trust  Documents  and  ADB\u2019s  normal \narrangements for TAs to the extent they are consistent. Project activities submitted for approval \nmust  be  consistent  with  the  PPIAF  mission,  have  government  commitment,  provide \nadditionality, have quality assurances, and meet regional, sectoral, environmental, and social \nresponsibilities.  Under  the  PPIAF  Trust  Documents,  ADB  together  with  the  other  PPIAF  \nmembers will determine particular priorities through the approval of an annual work program. \n \n19.   Financial Arrangements. To maximize flexibility for contributors, PPIAF has a two-tier \nfinancial structure: a core fund and noncore funds. The core fund comprises a pool of resources ", "    5 \nthat can be used for any activity falling within the work program approved by PC. The funds may \nbe applied to governance costs, country-specific activities, and multicountry activities. Noncore \nfunds are those that include aid agency restrictions relating to specific themes or activities. As \neach contributor will enter into an agreement for its contributions to PPIAF, ADB will follow \nsimilar arrangements, as for other ADB-financed funds.2  \n \n20.   Consulting Services Arrangements. The PMU, in joint consultation with ADB, will \ndesignate a task manager for each PPIAF-funded, ADB-proposed activity. The task manager \nwill generally initiate the hiring of consultants. In selecting consultants for project activities the \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants will apply.   \n \n21.   Past Performance. To date all projects submitted to PPIAF have been granted funding. \nFor the period 1 July 2001\u201330 June 2002, a total of $870,000 was granted to ADB TA projects, \nof which $464,500 was contributed to the Joint ADB-PPIAF conference on PSP in infrastructure, \nand the poor with focus on Asia (Appendix 4).  \n \n22.   Reporting and Auditing Requirements. In general, PC members receive a quarterly \nfinancial  statement  (unaudited)  and  a  quarterly  progress  report  on  the  status  of  approved \nactivities. They also receive an annual report on all PPIAF activities and summary financial \nstatements, no later than 6 months following the end of PPIAF\u2019s fiscal year (1 July\u201330 June of \neach  calendar  year).  ADB  will  provide  PPIAF  a  quarterly  report  of  activities  and \naccomplishments for the projects, which ADB has been assigned as task manager. The World \nBank, as trust fund administrator, will provide members a management statement, annually, \ntogether  with  attestation  from  the  external  auditor  of  the  satisfactory  performance  of  the \nprocedures and controls used in administering PPIAF funds. External reviews and financial \naudits of PPIAF activities may be performed at the request of the PC and contributors with \nrespect to their contributions. ADB will request an annual review and financial audit of its \ncontributions and expenditures incurred. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 on a grant basis for \nthe Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n \n \n                                                 \n2   TA 5951-REG: Small and Medium-Size Enterprise Growth and Development in the Mekong Region, for $750,000, \napproved on 17 November 2000; TA 5683 REG: South Pacific Project Facility, for $300,000 approved on 26 April \n1996; and TA 5891-REG: South Pacific Project Facility II: Private Sector Development Support, for $300,000, \napproved on 23 December 1999.

Improving Infrastructure Provision Through Regional Integration. The provision of \ncost-effective and affordable infrastructure services to consumers in many developing countries \nmay  be  best  achieved  by  fostering  integration  in  providing  infrastructure  services.  This \napproach, which consists of providing infrastructure services across the geographic boundaries \nof neighboring countries, allows for economies of scale that could not be obtained when a given \ninfrastructure  service  is  provided  within  the  geographic  boundaries  of  a  country.  This  is \nparticularly the case when the country has a small population that is scattered and has a low per \ncapita income.  \n \n2.  Ensuring  Environmentally  Sustainable  Pro-Poor  Infrastructure.  Done  correctly, \nprivatization of infrastructure enterprises can yield positive environmental changes in addition to \nfiscal and economic benefits. These benefits can come from, for example, reduced emissions \nand  pollution  levels  resulting  from  more  efficient  resource  use  in  an  economy,  and  more \neffective, arms-length regulation of private firms. Private firms also bring in newer, and hence \ncleaner technologies. Attention to the environmental benefits of public private infrastructure \n(PPI) is increasingly seen to be a critical aspect of sustainable development, particularly in the \nenvironmentally relevant infrastructure sectors of power, water, and sanitation, However, PPI \nonly  offers  the  opportunity  to  make  strategic  decisions  with  medium-term  and  long-term \nenvironmental  benefits.  What  conditions  should  be  in  place  for  capturing  the  potential \nenvironmental benefits of PPI? What is the role of international standards/guidelines such as the \nOrganization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development  (OECD)  guidelines,  International \nOrganization  for  Standardization  (ISO)  9000,  and  14001  certification  programs  in  a  PPI \ntransaction? More generally, how should environmental considerations both at an upstream, \npolicy, regulatory, and institutional level, and at a downstream transaction level be integrated \ninto the infrastructure privatization process? \n \n3.  Designing Effective Bidding Procedures for PPI Transactions. The last decade in \nparticular has shown a growing body of experience on designing bidding procedures for PPI \nprojects  (both  greenfield  cases  and  divestiture  of  existing  companies).  However,  not  all \ntransactions have been undertaken in a transparent manner, or in an environment that benefited \nfrom set standards and processes for conducting these transactions. What approaches can be \nused to apply some transparency in the event of unsolicited proposals? And more generally, \nhow can bidding procedures for PPI projects be made more consistent and transparent? \n \n4.  Supporting PPI in Postconflict Situations. Governments are increasingly looking to \nthe private sector to help them rebuild infrastructure in a postconflict situation. However, those \ngovernments may not be taking full advantage of the effectiveness and sustainability of PPI. To \nthat end, it would be useful to devise strategies that would help governments go beyond using \nthe private sector to build infrastructure in a postconflict setting. In fact, the government may be \nable to also use the private sector as the means for financing and operating some of the \ninfrastructure as well as rebuilding it.  \n \n ", "10  Appendix 2 \n5.    Making the Transition to Markets. The establishment of competitive markets for \nmany  segments  of  infrastructure  services  offers  great  potential  for  improved  efficiency. \nHowever,  managing  the  transition  from  monopoly  to  competition  poses  many  practical \nchallenges  for  policy  makers  and  regulators.  Tariffs  may  need  to  be  rebalanced.  Subsidy \nsystems may need to be redesigned. Long-term contracts may need to be renegotiated and \nassets may become \u201cstranded,\u201d giving rise to possible compensation issues. Utility regulators \nalso need to define new roles vis-\u00e0-vis competition authorities.  \n ", "  Appendix 3  11 \n \n \nGOVERNANCE AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE \nPUBLIC-PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE ADVISORY FACILITY (PPIAF) \n \n \nA.  Program Council (PC) \n1.  The PC is responsible for (i) defining the policies and strategies of the Public-Private \nInfrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), (ii) approving the indicative annual work program and \nfinancial plan, and (iii) reviewing PPIAF performance. The PC generally meets once a year but \napproves PPIAF proposals throughout the year on a \u201cno-objection\u201d basis. As a member of the \nPC, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has the authority to approve or object to each PPIAF \nproposal. Regional coordination offices (RCOs) have been established in Asia (Singapore), \nstaffed by two full-time professionals and a small support unit, and in Africa to act as PPIAF\u2019s \nrepresentative offices in those regions. \n \nB.  Project Management Unit \n2.  The Project Management Unit (PMU) is responsible for PPIAF\u2019s day-to-day operations. \nThe  PMU  reports  to  the  PC  at  least  quarterly  through  the  PC  chair.  Among  the  main \nresponsibilities of the PMU, whose staff is recruited internationally for their relevant expertise, is \nto (i) review proposals for PPIAF assistance; (ii) recommend approval to the PC; (iii) maintain \neffective relationships with (a) contributors, (b) recipient governments, (c) the private sector, and \n(d) stakeholders; (iv) propose and administer the PPIAF work plan and budget; (v) manage the \ndisbursement of funds; and (vi) oversee the RCOs\u2019 operations. The RCOs assist the PMU in \nexecuting the PPIAF work program in their respective jurisdictions. \n \nC.  Technical Advisory Panel \n3.  The Technical Advisory Panel is composed of up to six independent experts in matters \nrelated to private involvement in infrastructure in developing countries, and ensures the quality \nand relevance of PPIAF-financed activities. \n \nD.  PPIAF Governing Structure \n4.  PPIAF is a multi-agency technical assistance facility that is governed by a PC made up \nof contributing agencies. Each and every agency contributing to PPIAF has an equal seat on the \nPC\u2014regardless of that agency\u2019s level of contribution. In practice, this means the agencies all \nreceive the same information about PPIAF\u2019s activities, the management of funds, and the \nimpact of PPIAF activities. Moreover, every contributor on the PC receives every application \nvalued at more than $75,000, along with a summary sheet describing the proposed activity, and \nmay approve or reject that project. A rejection from any one contributor will mean a rejection of \nthe application. These rights and responsibilities are set out in PPIAF's Charter, which can be \nfound on PPIAF\u2019s web site: http://www.ppiaf.org/files/charterjuly2000am.pdf. \n \n5.  The PMU of PPIAF is tasked with the day-to-day management of the facility, monitoring \nof funds and activities, coordination of the PC and the Technical Advisory Panel, and the \nsummary and presentation of applications for agency approval. The Program Manager was \nhired by the PC, which conducted interviews and ranked candidates in joint session. \n ", "12  Appendix 3 \nCRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF ACTIVITIES OF PUBLIC-PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE \nADVISORY FACILITY (PPIAF)  \n \n \n1.  As stated in PPIAF\u2019s Charter (Article 17), activities must meet strict criteria before they \ncan  be  approved.  The  criteria  include  demonstrated  commitment  from  the  beneficiary \ngovernment in the case of country-specific activities, and proof of aid coordination. Specifically, \nthe activity must \u201cnot conflict with programs of activities being undertaken\u201c by any of PPIAF\u2019s \ncontributors. This article also restricts PPIAF funding to those activities that require a \u201cnet \nadditional flow of resources,\u201c meaning that PPIAF does not fund projects that could receive \nfunding from any other source. For example, if an application that involves the preparation of a \nproject that will eventually be funded from loans from the World Bank or the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), PPIAF will not accept the application. It would be assumed that project preparation \nbudget should be available from the lending institution. To be clear, this means PPIAF does not \ncontribute grant funds to World Bank projects, and would not for any other aid agency. One of \nthe main reasons why the Project Management Unit (PMU) rejects an application is when due \ndiligence shows that there were other more suitable sources of funding including credit lines \nfrom aid agencies. \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  13 \nPUBLIC-PRIVATE INFRASTRUCTURE ADVISORY FACILITY (PPIAF) \nAs of 11 December 2002  \n \n \n  Title  Amount \nNew for FY2003  1.
