The Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan has requested technical assistance (TA) \nfrom the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to help prepare the Social Infrastructure for Internally \nDisplaced Persons (IDPs) and Vulnerable Population Project. The Fact-Finding Mission visited \nthe  country  in  August  2004  and  held  discussions  with  officials  from  Ministry  of  Economic \nDevelopment, State Committee for Refugees and IDPs (SCRI), State Program for Poverty \nReduction and Economic Development (SPPRED) Secretariat, Ministry of Finance, Azerbaijan \nRehabilitation and Reconstruction Agency, Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit, and \nWorld Vision. The mission visited IDP settlements in Sabirabad and Bilasuvar districts and the \ntown of Mingechevir. \n \n2.  This paper is based on the understandings reached by the mission with the Government \non the objectives, scope, terms of reference, cost estimates, financing plan, and implementation \narrangements of the TA. The TA is included in ADB\u2019s Country Strategy and Program Update for \n2004\u20132006.1 It supports ADB\u2019s strategy of strengthening the provision of public services to \nthose in greatest need, and strengthening governance and accountability. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Despite the country\u2019s relatively rapid growth in gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, \nmany people lack access to adequate social infrastructure services such as drinking water and \nsanitation, education, and quality health care. Water supply, wastewater, sanitation, education, \nand health services have all significantly deteriorated since independence in 1991. At the same \ntime, demand for these is increasing, particularly in urban and peri-urban areas. IDPs constitute \none of the most vulnerable segments of the population. Though progress has been made to \nimprove their living conditions in recent years, about 382,000 IDPs are reported to live in \ntemporary shelters and lack access to basic services. \n \n4.  Reducing the hardships facing IDPs remains a top priority of the Government. The State \nProgram for the Improvement of Living Conditions and Increasing of Employment for Refugees \nand IDPs was approved in July 2004 and sets out a program of specific measures that includes \nthe construction of improved housing and infrastructure, increasing employment, and subsidies \nfor basic services. Significant investments in housing and supporting infrastructure, funded by \nthe State Oil Fund, are being overseen by the SCRI. Under the aforementioned State Program, \nbetween 2004 and 2007 the Government aims to construct housing for about 15,300 families \nliving in specific areas, and for an unspecified number of families currently living in school \nbuildings in various cities and districts. \n \n5.  Other  vulnerable  groups,  including  the  unemployed,  female-headed  households, \npensioners, and the disabled, also lack access to adequate social infrastructure. Addressing \ntheir needs depends on the ability of municipalities and community groups to identify priorities \nand foster local initiatives. The creation of municipalities in 1999, followed by the adoption of \nlaws  on  the  financial  basis  and  functions  of  municipalities,  were  important  steps  toward \nstrengthening  local  self-governance  and  devolving  responsibilities  for  service  delivery  to \nauthorities who are directly accountable to local residents. These authorities are well placed to \nunderstand and respond to the needs of the local population, to plan strategically for the future \neconomic development of their areas, and to help define the most vulnerable segments of the \n                                                 \n1 The TA first appeared in the Internet edition of ADB Business Opportunities on 15 July 2004.  \n ", "2  \npopulation. In practice, however, municipalities remain weak, are unable to raise resources \nneeded to fulfill their mandate, and lack capacity for effective delivery of basic services. \n \n6.  The development community has been engaged in efforts to assist the IDPs. In 2002, \nthe Government and ADB launched a Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction-funded project to \nresettle IDPs in Mingechevir,2 and to provide them with housing, basic infrastructure services, \nand  microcredit.  A  new  settlement  for  over  400  families  was  recently  completed  and \ncommissioned. The experience has shown that efforts to address the specific needs of IDPs \nrequires  the  involvement  of  beneficiaries  and  ongoing  consultation  with  local  government3 \nauthorities, and that residents and community groups are willing and able to discuss and identify \ntheir own needs. The Social Infrastructure for IDPs and Vulnerable Population project was \nincluded in the Country Strategy and Program Update for 2004\u20132006 as a means of improving \nsocial infrastructure services for IDPs and other poor segments of the population. \n \n7.  Several outstanding issues pose a challenge to the sustainability of new settlements, \nincluding land titling, institutional and financial arrangements for maintenance and operation of \ninfrastructure  facilities  (including  user  charges),  and  prospects  for  economic  activities  and \nemployment. Furthermore, the exact number of IDPs living in inadequate housing is difficult to \nascertain,  since  many  registered  IDPs  are  thought  to  have  settled  among  the  general \npopulation.  The  TA  will  carefully  consider  these  issues  together  with  lessons  from  the \nMingechevir project. \n \n8.  In  2002,  the  Government  gave  prominence  to  the  Millennium  Development  Goals \n(MDGs) in the context of the country\u2019s first poverty reduction strategy, culminating in the launch \nof the SPPRED. The SPPRED places the MDGs as the ultimate long-term goals, and reflects a \nreorientation  from  humanitarian  aid  toward  sustained  poverty  reduction  and  economic \ndevelopment.  The  SPPRED  recommends  improving  the  institutional  framework  for  poverty \nreduction by strengthening professionalism and transparency, among others, and promoting \ndecentralization  and  local  self-governance.  At  the  request  of  the  Government,  ADB  has \nresponded with an integrated multiyear program of TA and loans that addresses key priorities. \nThis TA will address shortcomings in social infrastructure services in the context of long-term \ninstitutional and policy needs, and the priorities of vulnerable groups. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The TA will help prepare an economically and institutionally viable investment project \nthat will improve access to basic social infrastructure for vulnerable segments of the population, \nincluding IDPs, while simultaneously building the capacity of local governments and community \ngroups to identify priorities, plan strategically, and strengthen service quality and coverage. This \nwill help provide a sustainable foundation for economic development in the country\u2019s secondary \ntowns. \n \n10.  The TA will be conducted in two stages, beginning with an assessment of (i) priority \nsocial infrastructure needs in three secondary towns, (ii) capacity-building needs related to the \nstrengthening  and  delivery  of  infrastructure  services  for  IDPs  and  vulnerable  groups,  and \n                                                 \n2  ADB. 2002.

In the second stage, the TA will develop a project to \naddress priorities and needs identified in the assessment. The preliminary project framework is \nin Appendix 1. \n \n11.  The  ensuing  loan  project  will  include  support  for  newly  constructed,  upgraded,  or \nrehabilitated social infrastructure in selected sectors (e.g., public schools, housing for IDPs, \nsanitation  facilities)  or  the  extension  of  existing  facilities  (water  supply  and  other  urban \ninfrastructure). The TA will pay particular attention to policy and institutional arrangements \nneeded to sustain the impact of the project, including strengthened local decision making, \naffordable user fees, cost recovery, and more secure tenure. The TA will take into account \nlessons learned from related programs including those supported by the Government, ADB, and \nother development partners. The initial poverty and social analysis is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n12.  The TA will be conducted in two stages, as described below.  \n \n13.  Part  A:  Assessment  of  Social  Infrastructure  Priorities  and  Capacity-Building \nNeeds in Selected Towns. The TA will recommend three secondary towns for participation in \nthe  loan  project,  taking  into  account:  (i) the  Government\u2019s  strategy  for  regional  economic \ndevelopment, (ii) the Government\u2019s program to assist IDPs, (iii) local government commitment \nto  decentralization,  and  (iv) other  development  partner  and  government  investments.  The \nselection will then be made in close consultation with the Government, on the basis of these \ncriteria: strong municipal leadership, local government commitment to decentralization, and the \npotential for the proposed loan project to achieve its objectives. \n \n14.  In the selected towns, the TA will assess (i) infrastructure needs of IDPs and other \nvulnerable groups based on interviews with residents and leaders; and (ii) capacity-building \nneeds of municipalities, Local Executive Committees, and community groups, especially as \nthese  relate  to  their  ability  to  assess  priorities,  plan strategically,  and  adopt  inclusive  and \ntransparent decision-making mechanisms. \n \n15.  The TA will assess progress toward decentralization, paying particular attention to the \ndevolution of functional and fiscal responsibilities to municipalities in secondary towns, and \nshortcomings in institutional capacity. It will review and assess the formal and actual delineation \nof functions between local self-government (the municipalities) and the state (rayon and Local \nExecutive Committees), and assess the fiscal basis of municipalities and related decision-\nmaking processes. \n \n16.  Part B: Preparation of the Investment Project. Based on findings from Part A, the TA \nwill prepare a loan project to address priority needs in the three selected towns. This will include \n(i) subproject  investments  in  new,  rehabilitated,  or  upgraded  housing  and/or  municipal \ninfrastructure (e.g., public schools, water supply, and sanitation) for IDPs; (ii) a scheme to \nsupport  local  initiatives  to  improve  social  infrastructure  services;  (iii) capacity  building  for \nmunicipalities, local executive committees, community groups, and other project partners; and \n(iv) support for project management. \n \n17.  Social Infrastructure for IDPs. The TA will prepare feasibility studies for multisector \ninvestments in each selected town aimed at improving housing and services for the most needy \nIDPs. These subprojects will be developed in partnership with local executive committees, \nmunicipalities, and beneficiaries. \n ", "4  \n \n18.  Social Infrastructure for Municipal Development. The TA will develop a component to \nhelp  municipalities  and  community  groups  identify,  design,  and  implement  subprojects  to \nimprove social infrastructure services over a multiyear period. Municipalities, beneficiaries, and \nother stakeholders will be involved in priority setting and selection of subprojects, and will be \nheld accountable for results.  \n \n19.  Capacity Building. The TA will prepare a capacity-building component to strengthen \nlocal  level  skills  and  practices  for  planning  and  managing  social  infrastructure  service  in \nparticipating municipalities. Target groups include staff of municipalities and local executive \ncommittees,  and  members  of  community  groups.  Focal  areas  include  strategic  planning, \nbudgeting, and tools for strengthening transparency and accountability for service delivery.  \n \n20.  Project  Management.  The  TA  will  make  recommendations  for  appropriate \nimplementation arrangements for the loan project, taking into account the emphasis on local \ninitiative  and  capacity  building,  and  the  Government\u2019s  objective  of  strengthening  the \nmunicipalities. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n21.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $625,000 equivalent, of which $360,000 is the \nforeign exchange cost and $265,000 equivalent is the local currency cost. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $500,000 equivalent, covering the entire foreign exchange cost and \n$140,000 equivalent of the local currency cost. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by the \nJapan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government will provide the \nbalance of the local currency cost, equivalent to $125,000, for counterpart staff, office space, \nadministrative support, and logistics. The Government has been informed that approval of the \nTA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. Details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan are in Appendix 3.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n22.  The SCRI will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and is responsible for liaising with \ncentral and municipal government authorities, nongovernment organizations, and community \ngroups. SCRI will appoint a senior official as the TA coordinator to direct the TA in cooperation \nwith ADB. The Government will form a steering committee to direct and coordinate TA activities; \nthe committee will be cochaired by the SCRI and SPPRED secretariat, and will include a \nrepresentative  from  each  of  the  following:  Ministry  of  Economic  Development,  Ministry  of \nFinance, Ministry of Justice, and the Permanent Commission for Regional Issues of the Milli \nMejlis (National Assembly). \n \n23.  The  TA  will  require  about  56  person-months  of  consulting  services,  including  16 \ninternational and 40 local. The international consultants will have expertise in engineering for \ninfrastructure services (schools, water, sanitation, roads, etc.); economic and financial analysis; \ndecentralization  and  its  implications  for  the  management  and  financing  of  municipal  and \ncommunity  services;  community-driven  development  approaches  to  poverty  reduction, \nprocurement,  and  financial  management;  and  environmental  analysis.  The  domestic \nconsultants, associated with international consultants, will have expertise in engineering for \ninfrastructure  services,  local  government  administration,  beneficiary  consultation  and \nparticipation, contracting and procurement, financial management, and training. The terms of \nreference for consultants are in Appendix 4. \n ", "  5\n \n24.  The consultants will be engaged through an international consulting firm and individuals \nin  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. A simplified technical proposal \nand  the  quality-  and  cost-based  selection  method  will  be  used  to  select  and  engage  the \nconsultants.  In  addition  to  staff,  the  Government  will  provide  an  office  with  utilities  and \ntelecommunications access, as well as materials, data, maps, and related documents required \nby the TA. All procurement under the TA will be in accordance with ADB's Guidelines for \nProcurement. \n \n25.  The TA will be implemented over a period of 4 months commencing in February 2005 \nwith expected completion in June 2005. The consultants will submit an inception report 3 weeks \nfrom the commencement of the TA. An interim report assessing priority investment needs, \ncapacity-building needs, and institutional and policy issues will be submitted after 6 weeks. A \nworkshop  will  be  held  with  stakeholders  from  the  Government,  municipalities,  and \nnongovernment organizations 2 months after the commencement of the TA, who will discuss \nthe interim report and providing guidance to the project design. An annotated outline of the \nproject design will be submitted after 12 weeks, and a draft final report will be submitted after 16 \nweeks. Two tripartite meetings will be held, the first immediately following the stakeholder \nworkshop, and the second following the submission of the draft final report. A final report \nincorporating comments will be submitted 2 weeks after the second tripartite meeting. \n \n26.  The following equipment is needed for the TA: three desktop computers and software, \none  printer,  one  scanner,  accessories,  one  facsimile  machine,  and  one  photocopier.  The \nequipment is for use by consultants, and will be procured by them in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines for Procurement. The equipment will be turned over to the Executing Agency upon \ncompletion of the TA. \n \nIV.

Overview \n \n1.  The  objective  of  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  is  to  assess  priorities  in  social \ninfrastructure  for  internally  displaced  persons  (IDPs)  and  other  vulnerable  groups  living  in \nsecondary towns, together with related policy and institutional needs, and to develop a loan \nproject to address these.  \n \n2.  The consultants\u2019 work will be conducted in two stages, beginning with an assessment of \npriority social infrastructure needs in three secondary towns, capacity-building needs related to \nthe  strengthening  and  delivery  of  infrastructure  services  for  these  groups,  and  related \ninstitutional and policy issues. In the second stage, the TA will develop a loan project to address \npriorities and needs identified in the assessment.  \n \nB.  Part  A:  Assessment  of  Social  Infrastructure  Priorities  and  Capacity-Building \nNeeds in Selected Towns (approximately 2 months) \n \n3.  The consultants will recommend three secondary towns for participation in the loan \nproject, taking into account (i) the Government\u2019s strategy for regional economic development; \n(ii) the  Government\u2019s  program  to  assist  IDPs;  (iii) local  government  commitment  to \ndecentralization; and (iv) other development partner and government investments.  \n \n4.
