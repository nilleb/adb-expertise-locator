During the Country Programming Mission in 2000, the Government of India confirmed the \nselection of the State of Kerala to receive support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for \ncomprehensive economic and structural reforms. Following further discussions, the Government \nand ADB agreed that technical assistance (TA) would be provided for the Kerala Sustainable \nUrban Development Project in 2003 and the proposed loan in 20041.  An ADB mission visited the \nstate from 26 February to 3 March 2003 to undertake fact-finding for the TA to prepare the Kerala \nSustainable Urban Development Project.2 The mission held discussions with state and central \ngovernment officials as well as elected representatives of selected municipalities,3 and reached an \nunderstanding  on  the  objectives,  scope,  cost,  and  implementation  arrangements  of  the  TA.  \nAppendix 1 provides the summary initial poverty and social analysis. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n2.  The  previous  operational  strategy  for  India,  launched  in  1996,  introduced  state-level \noperations in a few reform-oriented states to fully exploit complementarities and synergies between \ninterventions to maximize the development impact in those states. Based on a set of criteria \nagreed with the Government, and consultation with other developmental partners, ADB adopted \nGujarat, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh as its focal states. Typically, ADB\u2019s state-level operations \nhave consisted of a public resource management program to support fiscal consolidation with \nprograms of sectoral reforms and investment in infrastructure sectors like power, transportation, \nand urban social infrastructure. Kerala was the third focal state selected for such state-level \nassistance,  with  a  cluster  loan  for  Modernizing  Government  and  Fiscal  Reform  approved  in \nDecember 20024 and a TA for Kerala Power Sector Development Program in October 2001.5 \n \n3.  Kerala is a small state of 32 million inhabitants but has the third highest population density \nin India (819 people per square kilometer), after West Bengal and Bihar. Kerala has India\u2019s best \nsocial indicators in literacy, life expectancy, and infant mortality. Kerala is also remarkable for its \nhigh rate of participation in political life and high indicators of social capital.  Despite the state\u2019s \noutstanding social accomplishments, Kerala\u2019s prospects for prosperity are threatened by chronic \nmismanagement of the economy, manifested in the growing fiscal deficits and inadequate funding \nfor new infrastructure development. The impact is also felt with regard to accessibility to and \naffordability of basic urban services such as water supply, sanitation, primary health care, shelter, \nand social protection. The problem is aggravated by suboptimal use of public funds at all levels of \nthe state machinery.   \n \n4.  Responding to its growing economic problems and worsening social conditions, the state \nlaunched a reform program in the mid-1990s, referred to as the \u201cAgenda for Change.\u201d One of the \nimportant features of the Agenda for Change is a strong commitment to decentralization in line with \nthe 73rd  and  74th  amendments  to  India\u2019s  Constitution.  Pursuant  to  the  1996  Decentralization \nPlanning Campaign, almost 40% of the state's development expenditures are currently transferred \nto local governments and most urban functions are now delegated to municipalities. However, due \nto poor planning, weak implementation capacity, and mismanagement of scarce resources by local \ngovernments,  the  gap  between  demand  and  supply  in  basic  urban  services  has  not  been \n                                                 \n1 The country strategy and program for India 2004\u20132007 is scheduled for Board discussion in April 2003. \n2 The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet version) on 29 November 2001. \n3 In 2001, a mission visited Kerala on 17\u201321 December to hold discussions with concerned municipal governments.  \n4 ADB. 2002.

Instead,  the  quality  of  existing  urban  infrastructure  is  rapidly  deteriorating  with \ninadequate  operation  and  maintenance  while  the  fast  pace  of  urbanization  continues.  ADB \nassistance is therefore timely and crucial to sustain the momentum of reform; introduce necessary \nchanges in the administrative, legal, and institutional framework; and meet the urgent investment \nrequirements for basic urban infrastructure. \n \n5.  Urban Kerala comprises five municipal corporations and 53 municipalities.  More than one \nfourth of the population live in urban areas, and this is a little less than the national average.6 \nHowever, unlike the other parts of the  county, the urbanization in Kerala is not limited to the \ndesignated cities and towns. Except for a few isolated villages in the hills, the entire state is an \nurban-rural continuum. Thus, Kerala society by and large can be termed as urbanized.7 The \ndispersed settlement pattern, however, reduces the effectiveness of investments in infrastructure \ndevelopment and social services. Because scarce resources are spread too thinly throughout \nKerala, the accruing benefit is only marginal in each city.  \n \n6.  High population density of urban areas of Kerala has resulted in urban poverty. This is \nmanifest  in  many  forms,  such  as  urban  slums,  unemployment,  lack  of  social  services,  and \nincreasing violence and crime. Despite a sharp decline in the incidence of poverty in Kerala in the \n1990s, urban poverty in Kerala remains significant (20.3%), and is much higher than rural poverty \n(9.4%). The magnitude of urban unemployment is also increasing due to the weak economy. In \nparticular,  due  to  stagnation  in  manufacturing  industry  in  Kerala,  sufficient  employment \nopportunities are not available for the urban dwellers. National Sample Survey data show that \nurban unemployment in Kerala is the second highest in India, at 10% in 2000 (only after Goa).8 \nDue to the high unemployment in the urban areas for the last two decades, Kerala has the highest \nnumber  of  people  who  committed  suicide\u2014most  of  them  being  young  and  educated  but \nunemployed. Further, due to the rapid increase in land values and construction costs about 18% of \nthe urban population in Kerala live in slum areas.9 The living conditions of slum dwellers are very \npoor. Drinking water and sanitary facilities are grossly inadequate. Only one-fourth of households \nin slums have electricity. The number of public latrines is far short of the need\u2014roughly one for \n1,000 slum dwellers.  \n \n7.  The involvement of other external agencies in the urban sector is very limited in Kerala. At \npresent, only two bilateral agencies are active, i.e., Japan Bank for International Cooperation \n(JBIC) and Department for International Development (DFID) of United Kingdom. JBIC is involved \nin water supply and sanitation and DFID is involved in slum improvement in Cochin. The ADB \nmission met with the representatives of both agencies to learn from their experience. Lessons \nlearned from urban projects in India will be fully incorporated in the project design during the TA \nimplementation.  \n \n8.  Some of the key recommendations of the recently completed urban sector10 review include: \n(i) project design can be made simpler by focusing on large capital investments for basic services \nsuch as water supply, sewerage, and roads, and limiting the number of towns participating in a \nproject, while the smaller revenue generating schemes such as market places, sites and services, \nand commercial complexes can be done by the local bodies using their own funds and through \nshort-term commercial borrowings; (ii) since the sustainability of the assets created under a project \n                                                 \n6 Based on the Census of India 2001. \n7 Government of Kerala. 2002.

THE  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n9.  The objective of the TA is to prepare a project that is suitable for ADB financing and  will \nprovide sustainable growth and poverty reduction in the five project cities in Kerala, and thereafter \nin the other cities in the state.  The project will assist the selected municipalities to (i) promote good \nurban governance in municipal management, and (ii) develop and expand urban infrastructure to \nincrease economic opportunities and to reduce vulnerability to environmental degradation and \nurban poverty.  The project will also formulate a support program for improving urban social \nservices  in  a  sustainable  manner  for  the  elderly,  destitute  women,  and  street  children. \nSustainability of the project investments will be ensured through improving management and \nfinancial performance of participating municipalities. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  project  will  primarily  cover  five  municipal  corporations/agglomerations  (Calicut,11 \nCochin, Quilon, Trissur, and Trivandrum) for urban governance and infrastructure improvement. \nOther smaller municipalities can benefit from the project through the Kerala municipal challenge \nfund, which will be created under the project, based on their willingness to adopt reform measures.   \n \n11.  While the exact scope of the ensuing project will be determined after the completion of the \nTA, the project is expected to have  four  parts:  (i)  part  A:  urban  services  and  infrastructure \nimprovement; (ii) part B: urban management reform and institutional development; (iii) part C: \nKerala municipal challenge fund; and (iv) part D: project implementation assistance (including \nconsulting services for project management, design, construction, and supervision). Part A, for \nurban services and infrastructure improvement, will include investments in physical infrastructure \n(limited to sewerage and drains, solid waste management, cleaning of inner city canals, and urban \n                                                 \n11 Calicut is also participating in TA 6026: Promoting Urban Poverty Reduction Through Participation in the Cities \nAlliance (ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance for Promoting Urban Poverty Reduction Through Participation in the Cities \nAlliance. Manila). Through the TA, Calicut is preparing its city development strategy and cities without slums initiatives. \nThese documents will form a good basis for identifying and preparing the Calicut subproject and investment \ncomponents. ", "4 \ntransport12) as well as urban social services (e.g., urban primary health care, social protection for \nthe weaker section of the society, and urban poverty reduction initiatives).  \n \n12.  For successful preparation of the project, the key activities of the TA will cover the following: \n(i)  sharing  of  the  lessons  learned  from  the  other  ADB-assisted  urban  projects  in  India;  (ii) \nassessment of the minimum requirements for the five project municipalities to be eligible for \nfinancing under the proposed ADB assistance (e.g., preparation of a participatory vision paper for \ncity development, formation of a municipal coordination committee consisting of different citizen \ngroups,  and  adoption  of  financial  management  plan);  (iii)  review  of  city  information  through \nsocioeconomic surveys, engineering field surveys and mapping, and secondary sources; (iv) \npreparation of an indicative investment program (including the specific project components to meet \nthe priority needs) for each selected city; (v) assessment of the feasibility (technical, economic, \nfinancial,  social,  environmental,  and  institutional)  of  the  proposed  investment  packages;  (vi) \ndevelopment of a comprehensive capacity-building program for urban governance and institutional \ndevelopment by integrating separate initiatives under three ongoing programs, i.e., Kudumbashree \n(state poverty eradication program), Information Kerala Mission, and ADB-sponsored Modernizing \nGovernment Program;13 (vii) formulation of the Kerala municipal challenge fund, which will be \nmanaged by a professional fund management company to promote urban sector reform in five \nmunicipal corporations and other district towns; (viii) recommendation of measures to improve \naccess to commercial financing for municipal development (e.g., pooled municipal banking, and \nrestructuring of Kerala Urban Development Finance Corporation); (xi) participatory workshops and \nstakeholder consultation in the project cities to assess needs, possibilities, and priorities of groups \nof urban people, including the urban poor and other vulnerable groups; and (x) recommendation of \nkey municipal reform measures that will be adopted under the project.   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1.255 million equivalent, comprising a foreign \nexchange cost of $480,000 and local currency cost of $775,000 equivalent. The entire foreign \nexchange cost and $520,000 equivalent in local currency will be financed on a grant basis by the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom. The state government will contribute the remaining local \ncurrency cost of $255,000 equivalent for office accommodation, counterpart staff support, facilities \nfor seminars and meetings, and other administrative expenses. The government will also provide \nall information required for the TA activities. Details of the cost estimate and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. The government has been advised that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to \nfinance any ensuing project.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The local self government urban (LSGU) of the state government will be the Executing \nAgency of the TA and will be responsible for overall coordination with ADB. It will also provide full \nadministrative and technical support to the consultants and will coordinate all activities under the \nTA with the project municipalities. LSGU will provide adequate office space for the consultants with \nsufficient communication means. \n \n                                                 \n12  Urban water supply is not included due to the earlier commitment of JBIC to provide a large loan to the urban water \nsupply sector in the state. However, for the cities that are not covered under the proposed JBIC assistance, a water \nsupply component may be considered on a full cost-recovery basis.  \n13  The additional resource requirements for integration and gap-filling will be assessed during the TA, for financing by a \nbilateral grant. ", "    5 \n15.  Before the fielding of the consultants, the state government will establish a TA steering \ncommittee, chaired by the secretary of LSGU, consisting of the secretaries of all concerned state \ndepartments as well as the municipal commissioners and mayors of the participating cities. The \nsteering committee will meet at least three times during TA implementation to discuss the reports \nof the consultants after the inception, midterm, and final workshops.  \n \n16.  The TA will be implemented over 8 months from September 2003 to April 2004. The \nconsulting services for the TA total 78 person-months (18 international and 60 domestic), excluding \nthe inputs of a local institution that will conduct a baseline socioeconomic survey. An international \nfirm will be engaged to organize the TA activities and produce the intermediate and final outputs for \nreview  and  approval  by  LSGU  and  ADB.  The  international  experts  (with  person-months  in \nparenthesis) to be provided by the firm will include an urban development specialist as team leader \n(7),  municipal  finance  expert/financial  analyst  (3.5),  municipal  engineer  and  environmental \nspecialist (3.5), project economist (2), and social development and resettlement specialist (2). The \ndomestic consultants will include a deputy team leader with expertise in drainage and solid waste \nmanagement (8), urban governance and institutional development specialist (6), environmental \nspecialist (6), financial analyst (6), municipal engineers and sector specialists (15), urban transport \nengineer (6), social and gender development specialist (4), resettlement specialist (3), and public \nawareness consultant (6). The outline terms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. In \naddition, international and domestic experts will be supported by (up to) 30 person months of \nservices from technical/support staff and 16 person months of counterpart professional staff. LSGU \nwill provide 2 counterpart staff to work with the consultants during TA implementation. The team \nleader will recruit and engage the subprofessional staff as required.    \n \n17.  The TA will provide equipment such as computers and other office equipment that the \nconsultant will purchase in accordance with ADB\u2019s guidelines for procurement. The equipment will \nbe handed over to LSGU on completion of the TA. The TA will also provide funds for workshops, \nworking  group  studies,  and  surveys  (socioeconomic  and  technical)  to  be  conducted  by  the \nconsultants in accordance with arrangements acceptable to ADB.  \n \n18.  A full technical proposal with the quality- and cost-based selection method will be used to \nselect the consulting firm. The consultants\u2019 reporting requirements will include (i) an inception \nreport,  within  1  month  of  TA  commencement;  (ii)  an  interim  report,  within  4  months  of  TA \ncommencement; (iii) a draft final report, within 7 months; and (iv) a  final report, on completion of \nthe TA study. During implementation, the consultants will organize three workshops in Trivandrum \nto  discuss  the  inception,  interim,  and  draft  final  reports.  The  consultants  will  also  organize \nparticipatory  meetings  in  all  selected  cities  throughout  TA  implementation,  to  disseminate \ninformation on the project and incorporate the feedback from local stakeholders in the project \ndesign. The interim workshop will include a program for gender and development to discuss \ngender-related issues and the gender action plan under the project. Tripartite meetings will be held \nimmediately after the workshops for the inception, interim, and draft final reports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 to the Government \nof India to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of the United Kingdom for preparing the \nKerala Sustainable Urban Development Project, and hereby reports this action to the Board.   \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUMMARY INITIAL POVERTY AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS REPORT FORM  \n \nA.  Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \nSector identified as a national priority in country poverty  Sector identified as a national priority in country poverty \nanalysis?      Yes  partnership agreement?      Yes \n \nContribution of the sector/subsector to reduce poverty in Kerala: As in the rest of India, the data from the national \nsample survey (undertaken every 5 years) have been used to identify the percentage of people below the poverty line. \nBased on this assessment, central Government funds for poverty reduction are released to the state. The figures span \ntwo decades between 1974 and 1994 show that among India\u2019s state, Kerala has achieved the second highest decline in \npoverty levels, from 40.42% to 25.43%. Further, the 2000 survey shows that Kerala\u2019s poverty is only 12.72% against the \nnational average of 26.30%, improving its position to fifth among all Indian states despite low economic growth. The \nachievement is partly explained by the large inflow of remittances from the overseas workers in the Middle East.  \n \nHowever, Kerala shows the uneven sectoral performance in poverty reduction between rural and urban sectors. While the \ndecline of poverty between 1994 and 2000 is close to 50% in the state (from 25.43% to 12.72%), the reduction is almost \nentirely due to the remarkable reduction in poverty in the rural areas, from 25.76% to 9.40%. The decline was only \nmarginal in urban areas, from 25.43% to 20.3%. As a result, the level of urban poverty is now more than twice the level of \nthe rural poverty, while in 1994 the incidence of poverty was higher in rural areas. This points to a persistent problem of \nurban poverty particularly due to unemployment and underemployment resulting from lack of economic opportunities.   \n \nA well-coordinated approach is necessary to reduce urban poverty. First, employment opportunities of a permanent \nnature need to made available to the poor both by macro strategies aimed at labor intensive growth and micro strategies \nto enable the poor to attain the skills needed by the formal and semi formal sectors. Second, self-employment through \nurban microenterprises can be promoted through a package of credit subsidy, skills development, product development, \nand marketing. Third, with the support of urban local bodies and state government, basic urban infrastructure relating to \nhousing, water supply, sanitation, electricity, and roads has to be provided to a minimum standard. Fourth, the access of \nthe poor to quality health and education facilities needs to be ensured, which again calls for improving the services \navailable through hospitals and schools. Finally, the most vulnerable groups need to be identified through a transparent \nindex. A robust social protection system has to be set up for them, with a much higher level of support than at present. \nMany of these issues will be addressed through the proposed project in the urban sector. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Proposed Classification: Poverty intervention                      \n \nWhat Type of Poverty Analysis is Needed? For proper planning, a detailed and multidimensional poverty analysis will \nbe required. The national sample survey data does not contain detailed data at the local level. Hence, the technical \nassistance will be required to collect in-depth socioeconomic and poverty-related data for each of the five municipal \ncorporations. The data will include income and expenditure, demographic trends, gender issues, health, water and \nsanitation, child labor, and urban environment. The findings of the socioeconomic baseline survey will be used to improve \nthe access of the poor to the existing and newly created infrastructure facilities under the proposed project.  Furthermore, \na review of the existing initiatives of the state government and other partners in development will be undertaken. \nParticular attention will be paid to the innovative initiatives in assessment of poverty, introduced in the early 1990s, under \na pilot Urban Basic Services Program in Alleppey towns. The Alleppey methodology is believed to be superior to the \nconventional head count ratio since it captures multi-dimensional characteristics of poverty (beyond the simple income \npoverty) and leads to identification of the most vulnerable families. The poverty index developed under the Alleppey pilot \nprogram consists of nine nonmonetary indicators, each reflecting a different kind of deprivation (e.g., access to drinking \nwater, access to sanitary latrines, illiterate adult in the family, family getting barely two meals a day or less, alcoholic or \ndrug addict in the family, scheduled caste or scheduled tribe family). The Alleppey method has been tried out all the \nurban local bodies and is under continuing revision and refinement. Using this methodology, a transparent participatory \nassessment of poverty is possible. \n \n \nC.  Participation Process \n \nParticipation Strategy Required: The TA will use participatory methods of consultation and information gathering. Using \nthe appreciative inquiry approach and participatory and rapid assessment methods, the involvement of all concerned \nstakeholders, including the disadvantaged and women, will be ensured to identify the required support and possible \nmeans to ensure their participation at all stages of the project cycle. The TA will identify the need for and types of special \nprovisions required into the project design to enable full participation of women and the marginalized and/or minority and \nindigenous people (if any come within the ambit of the proposed project). The socioeconomic baseline survey will be \nconducted by an experienced local nongovernment organization or institution. To highlight issues at micro and macro ", "  Appendix 1  7 \nconducted by an experienced local nongovernment organization or institution. To highlight issues at micro and macro \nlevels, the degree of poverty among women and men and the existing labor market will be assessed through consultation \nwith stakeholders (all categories and levels). Both primary and secondary stakeholders (state government, local \nadministration, nongovernment organizations, citizens, aid and international agencies) along with their interests and \ncapabilities will be assessed. By organizing a gender workshop at the central level, the TA will ensure the involvement \nand participation of women in all stages of the proposed project. To ensure ownership and sustainability of the project, \nworkshops to flag milestones of the project will be organized at the state and local levels in each of the five proposed \nproject  cities.  The  workshops  will  be  for  information  sharing,  consultation,  shared  decision-making,  and  shared \nresponsibility, and foridentification of the roles and functions of the stakeholders. Participatory planning meetings with the \nmunicipalities and relevant stakeholders (ensuring that the needs of women are given positive consideration) will be held \nduring the TA implementation.   \n \nD.

Data Collection, and Preparation of Indicative Investment Program (2\u20133 months) \n   \n3.  Socioeconomic Survey. Engage a local institution or nongovernment organization to \nconduct a socioeconomic survey of the selected towns; collect baseline data on income and \nexpenditures,  demographic  trends,  gender  issues,  health,  welfare,  sanitation  and  urban \nenvironmental situations, and other related social circumstances; and analyze the poverty \nincidence in each town, including the projected growth in the incidence of urban poverty, and \ndescribe the nature and characteristics of poverty in selected towns. In the survey, develop an \nunderstanding of the size, nature, needs, possibilities, and priorities of urban groups. Pay \nparticular attention to collecting data on rural-urban migration (and urban to outside the state \nand country), as rural migrants tend to be excluded from surveys. Conduct demand surveys; \nassess capacity and willingness to pay for selected municipal services willingness to charge, \nand cost-sharing arrangements; and suggest alternative technical options and means of service \ndelivery suitable for urban groups to make essential improvements at the city and local level \nviable. \n   \n4.  Data on Infrastructure and Municipal Services Delivery. Collect and assess data \ncovering the towns' assets (e.g., infrastructure system, land uses, economic infrastructure, \nresidential, and other superstructure and essential planning data). Pay particular attention to the \nlevels of environmental infrastructure in the selected towns (sewerage and drains, solid waste \n                                                 \n1 Review the lessons from (i) ADB\u2019s Operations Evaluations Department\u2019s impact evaluation study on water supply \nand sanitation projects and (ii) TAs on water tariff reforms in the People\u2019s Republic of China and Viet Nam (ADB. \n1997.

For each urban \nsubsector, undertake the following assessments: \n   \n(i)  Examine water supply augmentation proposals (including assistance from Japan \nBank for International Cooperation) in conjunction with the existing distribution \nsystem. Review options for reducing leakages and wastes and promoting 24 \nhour  water  supply.  Assess  whether  the  water  supply  scheme  in  each  city \n(existing and planned) is adequate for developing a sewerage system. \n \n(ii)  Examine the sewerage and drainage systems with reference to their adequacy. \nIdentify needs for augmentation of discharge capacities, and possible locations \nfor sewage treatment plants and outlets for treated sewage discharge. Review \nthe state\u2019s environmental procedures. Provide benefit-cost analysis of individual \nsewage management versus a piped sewage system for low-income groups of \nurban population, and conversion of dry latrines into pour flush toilets; and \ncompare the options of various sewage treatment facilities. \n \n(iii)  Analyze existing facilities and managerial arrangements for handling solid waste \nand suggest improvements. Base the technical recommendations on physical \nand chemical analysis of solid waste, quantity generated, locations of pickup \npoints, design of collection system, transfer points, and methods and locations of \ndisposal. Examine the option of producing compost. \n \n(iv)  Examine  the  efficiency  and  equity  of  urban  transport  models  to  reduce \ncongestion  and  improve  road  safety,  including  by-passes,  mass  parking \nterminals at the city entrance, traffic management, and street lighting. \n \n(v)  Examine  urban  poverty  initiatives  under  Kudumbashree  (the  state  poverty \neradication program) and develop an investment program to support the program \nunder the proposed ADB assistance. Instead of creating a new poverty reduction \nprogram, the project will support and expand the ongoing initiatives for urban \npoverty  reduction.  To  promote  women\u2019s  participation  in  project  activities, \nsuccessful Kudumbashree experience will be reviewed and supported, especially \nfor the women in distress.2  \n \n(vi)  Examine the efficiency and equity of other urban social services (e.g., urban \nprimary  health  care,  and  social  safety  net  for  the  disadvantaged  groups)  to \nimprove sustainability of such services for the poor. \n   \n5.  Investment Program and Project Framework. Based on the assessment made and \noverall financial capability of each municipality to provide counterpart financing and service the \ndebt, identify subsectors in each city that require integrated upgrading. Estimate the subsector-\nspecific demand for basic urban infrastructure and services.

Identify a distinct opportunity for utilizing financing \nfrom the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction. \n   \n6.  Kerala Municipal Challenge Fund. Design a fund to promote urban management \nreform in the state. Five project cities and all other district towns will be eligible for loans (or \npartial grants depending the state government\u2019s policy) after meeting predetermined eligibility \nconditions. Two sets of criteria will be developed to (i) assess the city\u2019s commitment to urban \nmanagement reform; and (ii) then, to determine the technical, economic, financial, social, and \nenvironmental viability of individual investment proposals. The consultants will also develop a \ndetailed  management  plan  and  general  investment  guidelines  (e.g.,  maximum  size  of  an \nindividual loan/grant, subsectors to be supported, and a credit ceiling for each city) for the fund. \nAt least five sample subprojects will be identified and assessed to demonstrate the viability of \nthe fund. In addition, the consultants will prepare a plan for restructuring the Kerala Urban \nDevelopment Finance Corporation to assume an increased role in urban infrastructure financing \nfor municipal infrastructure development.  \n \nC.  Detailed Feasibility Study (4\u20135 months) \n7.  Project Design. Prepare a preliminary engineering design of the proposed project \ncomponents, and detailed cost estimates in ADB\u2019s format using the COSTAB software. Include \nthe  costs  for  consulting  services  (for  detailed  design,  implementation  of  the  project,  and \ninstitutional support), studies and training programs, interest charges on loan financing, and \nphysical and price contingencies at rates used by ADB. Examine the flow of funds under the \nproject and the requirements for and availability of counterpart fund. Propose procurement \nmodes and packages based on cost-effective bid packages.  \n   \n8.  Minimum Eligibility Conditions. Five municipal corporations are expected to enter into \na performance contract with the state government in exchange for ADB\u2019s financial assistance. \nThe consultants will develop a set of minimum requirements that the project cities will meet to \nbe eligible for ADB financing of the investments they prioritize. The requirements will mainly \nfocus on participatory planning, inclusive municipal management, and financial management \nplan.  \n \n9.  Implementation Arrangements. Assess the options for implementation arrangements \nfor financial, accounting, technical, and managerial capabilities of the executing agency and the \nmunicipalities. Recommend appropriate measures to facilitate project implementation, including \nstaffing and training of staff of project implementation units, supervision of construction works, \nmonitoring  and  reporting  of  the  subprojects,  and  provision  of  consulting  services  during \nimplementation. Propose appropriate financial, accounting, and managerial arrangements for \nproper O&M of all project facilities and estimate the costs and human resources requirements. \nPropose cost recovery mechanisms (including necessary institutional arrangements) through \ntaxes,  user  charges,  and  innovative  land  management  techniques  (e.g.,  advance  land \nacquisition,  land  readjustment)  for  O&M  and  recovery  of  initial  investments.  Prepare  an \nimplementation  schedule  for  detailed  engineering,  tendering,  and  construction  of  project \ncomponents.  Identify  the  requirements  for  key  advance  actions  to  avoid  the  delay  in \nimplementation.  In  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  requirements  for  the  project  performance \nmanagement system, develop the project monitoring and evaluation arrangements for executing \nand implementing agencies including the content and format of the progress reports. \n   ", "  Appendix 3  13 \n10.  Capacity Building and Institutional Strengthening. To ensure the sustainability of the \ninvestments under the project, develop a carefully designed capacity-building program for all \nparticipating urban local bodies, especially in collecting, updating, organizing, and managing \nfinancial and other information for routine work of municipality. Capacity building efforts are \nmost  effective  when  they  are  provided  as  on-the-job  support  over  3\u20135  years.  The  key \ncomponents of the capacity building program will include (i) computerizing a municipal data \nbase for tax billing, collection, and reassessment; (ii) setting up a modern municipal accounting \nsystem based on computerized operation of financial accounts for daily entry and reporting; (iii) \ntraining local staff to operate the municipal information system; (iv) inventing and reassessing \nproperty (conducting a property enumeration and preparing property tax maps); (v) surveying \nbasic infrastructure conditions, preparing digitized maps, and linking property and infrastructure \ndatabases and maps for infrastructure investment planning; and (vi) training elected officials \nabout their responsibilities and roles. Develop comprehensive 5-year program to cover all \ndistrict towns. Recommend a proper institutional structure to implement a large-scale capacity \nbuilding program during and after the implementation of the project. However, in developing \nsuch  a  program,  first  review  similar  capacity-building  programs  under  the  ongoing  state-\nsponsored schemes, including Kudumbashree, Information Kerala Mission, and Modernizing \nGovernment Program. Instead of creating a new program, develop options to integrate the three \nongoing programs under one umbrella with a shared timetable for implementing capacity-\nbuilding in project and other municipalities. \n   \n11.  Financial  and  Economic  Analyses.  (i)  Review  the  financial  performance  of  the \nselected municipalities. (ii) Prepare financial projections for operations 10 years after project \ncompletion. (iii) Compute relevant financial indicators of each town to assess its financial \nviability. (iv) Review cost-recovery policies and user charges in each town. (v) Assess the \nfinancial sustainability of the proposed project components. (vi) Assess the affordability of \ncurrent services and the ability to increase the user charges in the short and medium term, \ngiving  special  attention  to  the  potential  impact  on  low-income  households  and  marginal \nbusiness activities, and develop specific measures to reduce the impact of the increase in user \ncharges where necessary. (vii) Evaluate the need for subsidies to ensure affordability to the \npoor. Present justifications for any such subsidies based on ADB\u2019s criteria for subsidies, and \ndiscuss how such subsidies might be financed.  (viii) Quantify the subsidy element and identify \nthe targets of the subsidy. (ix) Examine feasible cost-recovery approaches to ensure full O&M \nand sustainability of the initial investments. (x) Carry out a least-cost analysis of alternatives to \nmeet the project\u2019s goal. Consider alternatives well beyond the current proposal, and include \nalternatives that are not directly related to the currently envisioned project. (xi) Estimate the \nfinancial and economic internal rates of return for the components, as relevant, following ADB's \nguidelines. (xii) Carry out sensitivity analyses, including the computation of sensitivity indicators \nand  switching  values.  The  sensitivity  analysis  should  reflect  changes  in  individual  key \nparameters and assumptions, and not be limited to changes in aggregate costs and benefits. \n(xiii) Study and recommend mechanisms for initial contributions from the beneficiaries as well as \nthe local and central governments for financing a reasonable share (i.e., 30% in India) of \ninvestment costs for urban infrastructure and services. In conducting economic and financial \nanalyses, refer to ADB's  Framework  for  the  Economic  and  Financial  Appraisal  of  Urban \nDevelopment Sector Projects and Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. \n   \n12.  Environmental Assessment. Prepare an initial environmental examination (lEE) or \nenvironmental impact assessment (EIA) for each city, and a summary lEE or EIA for the whole \nproject  in  accordance  with  ADB's  environmental  guidelines.  Prepare  IEEs  for  the  sample \nsubprojects under the proposed Kerala municipal challenge fund. Environmental assessments \nwill be prepared in accordance with ADB\u2019s environmental policy and relevant guidelines, and \n ", "14  Appendix 3 \nrules and requirements in India.

Conduct detailed poverty and social analysis as required; in particular, \nconduct gender analysis, and identify constraints on women\u2019s participation in project design, \nO&M, and training. Based on the socioeconomic survey, assess the socioeconomic benefits of \nthe  project  and  its  possible  negative  impact.  Prepare  an  overall  framework  for  people\u2019s \nparticipation in project preparation, implementation, and postproject O&M activities.  \n   \n14.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. At an early stage of TA implementation, apply \nADB\u2019s resettlement checklists to identify resettlement issues and ascertain the nature and \ndegree of the project\u2019s impacts on affected households and people. If the expected resettlement \nimpacts  are  significant,  prepare  an  appropriate  resettlement  plan  based  on  the  identified \nsubproject design in each town, in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on involuntary resettlement \nand Handbook on Resettlement, including the following; (i) review and assess the key policies, \nlaws, and guidelines regarding land acquisition, resettlement, and compensation; (ii) identify and \nenumerate the people likely to be affected through a survey and asset inventory that identifies \nall  types  of  loss;  consult  the  affected  people  to  ascertain  their  preference  for  relocation, \ncompensation, and livelihood restoration; establish an entitlement cutoff date supplementing the \nrecords with video taping (if necessary); and estimate  the requirements for financial resources \nand compare the amount with resources available from the national and state governments; (iii) \nidentify and establish options for relocating housing and other structures, including measures \nrequired  to  assist  with  transfer  and  establish  new  sites,  options  to  restore  or  enhance \nlivelihoods, and mechanisms for redressing grievances; and (iv) specify the main responsibilities \nfor  approving,  implementing,  managing,  financing,  and  monitoring  the  resettlement  plan, \ncapacity-building  programs  as  required,  implementation  schedule,  financial  plan  including \nresettlement budget, annual financing plan, and plan for internal and external monitoring and \nevaluation of the resettlement plan. Prepare a resettlement framework for the Kerala municipal \nchallenge fund to address the resettlement issues that may arise out of the subloans. The \nresettlement framework will specify the resettlement policy that will be adopted to provide \nsafeguards for resettlement effects, together with the applicable procedures for identifying the \naffected  people,  preparing  resettlement  plans,  approving  plans,  and  implementing  and \nmonitoring them. \n   \n15.  Indigenous People. Apply the Indigenous People\u2019s Checklist in Handbook on Poverty \nand Social Analysis in order to ascertain the number of indigenous people and their socio-\neconomic status and anticipated project impacts on them. Also use the checklist Categorization \nof Indigenous People, if necessary. Prepare indigenous people development plans if necessary \nin accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on indigenous people. \n \n16.  Implementation Assistance. Estimate requirements of the project to improve skills in \nengineering, planning, project management and other essential disciplines. Based on available \nskills,  recommend  additional  recruitment/upgrading  and  expertise.  Assess  the  institutional \nstrengths  and  weakness  of  the  executing  and  implementing  agencies  and  recommend \nstrengthening of institutional capabilities through organizational changes, new implementation \narrangements,  and  staff  recruitment  and  training;  and  use  domestic  and  international \nconsultants for specialized requirements. \n   \n "], "metadata": {"Creator": "R86-03 - Microsoft Word", "CreationDate": "D:20030520160041Z", "Title": "R86-03", "Author": "rsa", "Producer": "Acrobat PDFWriter 5.0 for Windows NT", "ModDate": "D:20030521092926+08'00'"}}
