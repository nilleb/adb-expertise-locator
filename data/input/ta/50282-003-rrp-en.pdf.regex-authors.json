THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on proposed grants \nto the Independent State of Samoa, the Kingdom of Tonga, Tuvalu, and the Republic of Vanuatu \nfor the additional financing of the Systems Strengthening for Effective Coverage of New Vaccines \nin the Pacific Project under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX).1 \n \n2.  The original project adopts a regional approach to improving immunization outcomes by \nintroducing three vaccines in Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. It supports the countries in \n(i) pooling the procurement of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, the pneumococcal \nconjugate vaccine (PCV), and the rotavirus vaccine through the United Nations Children's Fund \n(UNICEF); (ii) strengthening primary health care and the capacity to deliver vaccination programs; \nand (iii) increasing community awareness and the population's knowledge of and attitude toward \nvaccines.  The  project  will  reduce  the  burden  and  minimize  outbreaks  related  to  vaccine-\npreventable diseases, integrate immunization programs into broader health systems, and improve \naccess  to  primary  health  services.  As  a  response  to  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19) \npandemic, the governments of Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu have been preparing for the \nimminent arrival of COVID-19 vaccines, and have requested additional financing from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to further strengthen immunization programs and prepare for the \nvaccine rollout.2 The additional financing will build on the original project to support the four \ngovernments in meeting their urgent needs. \n \nII.  THE PROJECT \n \nA.  Rationale \n \n3.  Original project. ADB approved the original project for $25.1 million on 8 November 2018 \n(footnote 1). It comprises a loan of $2.25 million (Vanuatu) from ADB\u2019s concessional ordinary \ncapital resources, and grants of $7.50 million (Samoa), $3.85 million (Tonga), $2.50 million \n(Tuvalu), and $9.00 million (Vanuatu) from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources. The governments are \nproviding combined counterpart funding of $4.56 million. The loan and grant agreements for \nVanuatu were signed on 28 February 2019 and became effective on 1 July 2019. The grant \nagreement for Samoa was signed on 21 January 2019 and became effective on 1 July 2019; the \ngrant agreement for Tonga was signed on 29 November 2018 and became effective on 14 August \n2019; and the grant agreement for Tuvalu was signed on 12 December 2018 and became \neffective on 29 August 2019. The closing date for the loan and grants is 31 May 2024. The \nministries of finance in Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu are the executing agencies, and the \nrespective ministries of health (MOHs) are the implementing agencies for the project. All four \ndeveloping member countries (DMC) have signed agreements with UNICEF to procure new \nvaccines and strengthen immunization. They share a regional project management unit with \nseparate contracts and local consultants in each country to support the project's implementation.  \n \n4.  Project performance. The original project is rated for attention as of the fourth quarter of \n2020,3 primarily because of initial delays in contract awards and disbursements, which are being \naddressed. The performance of the project is considered satisfactory in other aspects.  \n \n1   ADB. Systems Strengthening for Effective Coverage of New Vaccines in the Pacific Project.  \n2  This lending proposal was not included in ADB. 2019. Regional Operations Business Plan, Pacific, 2020\u20132022. \nManila. The COVID-19 outbreak occurred in 2020. The Pacific Department confirmed that the 2020 resource \nenvelope can accommodate such financial assistance. A revised design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nNo transaction technical assistance is required. \n3  As per ADB. 2018. Additional Financing. Operations Manual. OM H5. Manila, the concept paper for the additional \nfinancing was approved on 23 September 2020, since the original project was rated for attention.  \n ", "2 \n(i)  Delivery of expected outputs. The implementation is rated on track to deliver all \nexpected outputs (para. 13). For output 1, the UNICEF Vaccine Independence \nInitiative (VII) agreements have been amended, and the VII credit line increased \nin all four countries to procure three new vaccines, i.e., the HPV vaccine, the PCV, \nand the rotavirus vaccine (para. 14). For output 2, UNICEF output agreements \nhave been signed, and initial activities for health system strengthening have taken \nplace in all four countries, including forecasting vaccine procurement, updating \nnational immunization policies with gender considerations, updating child health \nimmunization cards, and supporting integrated outreach programs. Delays in \nimplementation are expected, however, because of the ongoing response to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic and associated travel restrictions (para. 15). For output 3, \ncommunity engagement activities commenced in the first quarter of 2021. UNICEF \nis seeking to integrate these with ongoing risk communication activities (para. 16).  \n(ii)  Contract awards and disbursements. Actual contract awards total $12.0 million \n(47.9% of the project amount) and disbursements are $6.9 million (27.4%).4 \nThe delays in contract awards (76% against 2020 projections) and disbursements \n(65% against 2020 projections) are attributable to the relative inexperience of the \nimplementing agencies with ADB-financed projects. The situation improved when \na  project  management  firm  was  recruited  in  February  2020  to  assist  the \nimplementing agencies on procurement, multiple withdrawal applications, and \ndisbursements. There are currently no cost overruns. \n(iii)  Financial management covenants. The original project is on track on compliance \nwith financial management covenants.  \n(iv)  Safeguard policy requirements. All safeguards covenants under the original \nproject are being complied with.  \n(v)  Management of risks. Project risks are being managed successfully through \n(a) the recruitment of a project management firm to support the implementing \nagencies in financial reporting and procurement; and (b) the update of the UNICEF \nvaccine  agreements  by  all  four  countries  early  in  project  implementation, \nhighlighting their continued commitment to the partnership with UNICEF and to \nimproving immunization.  \n \n5.  Additional financing. The governments of Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu have \nincurred considerable costs to prevent the entry of COVID-19 through travel restrictions, 5 while \nmitigating the pandemic\u2019s effects on their economies. Additional financing is proposed to expand \nthe scope of the original project, i.e., to include the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, which will \nenable the gradual reopening of borders and economies, and reestablish the free movement of \npeople both nationally and internationally. Since the regulatory approvals and supply of COVID-\n19 vaccines to eligible countries under the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) and \nAdvance Market Commitment (AMC) mechanisms\u2014are still in progress, the exact vaccine type \nand delivery timeline remains to be confirmed. The additional financing will further strengthen the \nhealth systems\u2019 routine immunization programs and community engagement activities. With \nCOVID-19 vaccines expected to be available from Q2 2021 through COVAX, Pacific countries \nneed to prepare their health systems to safely introduce any such vaccine.6 The additional scope \nis a high priority for the governments as they plan to open their borders to travel, and is consistent \nwith the original project in strengthening health systems and increasing immunization coverage.  \n \n \n4  As of 31 December 2020. \n5  As of 16 March 2021, Samoa had reported four imported cases of COVID-19 and Vanuatu three cases, all of which \nhave recovered. Tonga and Tuvalu remain free of COVID-19. Cumulatively across Pacific DMCs, 2,364 confirmed \ncases and 28 deaths have been reported. \n6  COVAX is co-led by Gavi, the vaccine alliance; the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations; and the World \nHealth Organization (WHO). It was established in April 2020 to accelerate global access to COVID-19 vaccines. \n ", "3 \n6.  The additional financing will benefit from the established regional project management unit \nand a stronger partnership with UNICEF on immunization systems and vaccine procurement. The \nintroduction of COVID-19 vaccines through the additional financing will rely on procurement \narrangements established under the ongoing project, supported by measures to strengthen \nimmunization  systems  and  community  engagement.  Initial  delays  in  contract  awards  and \ndisbursements  can  also  be  minimized  by  using  the  original  project\u2019s  implementation \narrangements. The additional financing will support the overall project in achieving the outcome \nof increased national immunization coverage. No cost overruns exist at present. No new major or \ncomplex contracts are proposed. The COVID-19 vaccines will be procured through UNICEF, the \nlead procurement agency under COVAX.7 \n \n7.  Impact of the pandemic. Growth with COVID-19 is expected to be lower than pre-\nCOVID-19 projections in all four countries, and fiscal balances are set to worsen in FY2021 \n(Table 1).8 COVID-19-related border restrictions have severely hurt local commercial activities, \nespecially tourism and construction, and many businesses are facing financial difficulties and \nlaying off workers. The pandemic, coupled with the impacts of cyclones Harold and Tino in 2020, \nhas led to supply chain bottlenecks and disruptions in production, and lowered tax revenues.   \n \nTable 1: Growth and Fiscal Impacts  \nPre-COVID-19  With COVID-19 \nCountry  Indicator \nFY2020  FY2021  FY2020e  FY2021p \nGrowth (%)  3.5  2.7  (3.3)  (9.2) \nSamoa \nFiscal balance (% of GDP)  (1.2)  (2.0)  6.2  (9.8) \nGrowth (%)  2.0  2.7  (0.5)  (5.3) \nTonga \nFiscal balance (% of GDP)  0.9  (1.5)  3.1  (4.7) \nGrowth (%)  4.4  4.0  0.5  2.5 \nTuvalu \nFiscal balance (% of GDP)  1.8  2.5  9.1  0.0 \nGrowth (%)  3.1  3.2  (9.8)  2.0 \nVanuatu \nFiscal balance (% of GDP)  (1.0)  0.8  2.5  (2.0) \n( ) = negative, e = estimates, COVID-19 = coronavirus disease, FY = fiscal year, GDP = \ngross domestic product, p = projections. \nNote: The fiscal year ends on 30 June in Samoa and Tonga, and on 31 December in \nTuvalu and Vanuatu. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n8.  All four governments have declared and remain in states of emergency in connection with \nthe pandemic as of March 2021, and introduced measures to control the potential spread of the \ndisease, such as (i) implementing border and travel restrictions, local lockdowns, and social \ndistancing rules for mass gatherings; and (ii) strengthening health systems to prepare for and \nrespond  to  COVID-19  through  a  national  COVID-19  response  plan,  or  equivalent.  The \ngovernments are now looking at the introduction of a COVID-19 vaccine as another key measure \nto limit and control the pandemic. \n \n9.  Government response (needs assessment and vaccination allocation plan). The four \nDMCs conducted needs assessments of their immunization systems for the introduction of \nCOVID-19 vaccines through the Vaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment Tool. The World \nHealth Organization (WHO) and UNICEF, as well as ADB, supported these assessments in the \nareas of planning and coordination, vaccine procurement and financing, service delivery, training \nand supervision, cold chain, supply chain logistics, monitoring and evaluation, safety surveillance, \n \n7  More information on UNICEF\u2019s procurement mechanism is in Sector Assessment (Summary): Health (accessible \nfrom the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n8  All four countries benefited from development partner grant financing to support their COVID-19 responses in FY2020, \nwhich contributed to estimated surpluses. Fiscal deficits are projected to widen in FY2021.  \n ", "4 \nand demand generation.9 Country needs identified in the assessments\u2014e.g., strengthening of \ncold  chains,  monitoring  and  surveillance  systems,  integrated  outreach,  and  community \nengagement\u2014are aligned to the support proposed under the additional financing, and indicative \nsupport from other development partners. The DMCs have also committed to prioritizing COVID-\n19  vaccines  access  for  vulnerable  groups  and  managing  medical  waste  from  vaccines \ndeployment in accordance with WHO guidelines. All four DMCs demonstrate compliance with the \naccess criteria of APVAX (Table 2).10 \n \nTable 2: Compliance with Access Criteria of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility  \nAccess Criteria  ADB Assessment \n1. Demonstrated adverse  The COVID-19 pandemic has had adverse impacts in all four countries (para. 7). It \nimpact of COVID-19  is estimated to have increased poverty by 16%\u201345% in the four countries in 2020, \ncompared with pre-COVID-19 estimates.  Unemployment has risen and remittances \nhave dropped in 2020. The pandemic has impacted women through other channels \nas well, e.g., infection risk, gender-based violence, and increased burden of care. \n2. Completed needs  All four countries have used WHO\u2019s Vaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment \nassessments  Tool to complete a needs assessment that identified gaps in its immunization \n      systems. The government will address these through their National Deployment and \n  Vaccination  Plans,  which  are  deemed  operationally  acceptable  for  needs \n  assessments, readiness, and preparedness by the WHO. \n    National vaccination      All four countries are prioritizing vaccine access for frontline workers, high-risk \nallocation plan  populations  with  elevated  risk  factors  (e.g.,  the  elderly,  and  those  with  co-\n  morbidities, disabilities, or special needs), in accordance with the values framework \n  for COVID-19 vaccine allocation of WHO\u2019s SAGE. \n    Incremental medical waste  All four countries have detailed an incremental medical waste management plan in \nmanagement plan   accordance with WHO\u2019s Water, Sanitation, Hygiene and Waste for COVID-19 \n  guidelines to manage waste management from COVID-19 vaccine deployment. \n    Governor\u2019s letter  All four countries have submitted to ADB a Governor\u2019s letter reaffirming their \ncommitment to implement their National Deployment and Vaccination Plans and \ncompliance with the APVAX vaccine eligibility criteria. \n3. Established effective  All four  governments have  established a national coordinating committee, or \ndevelopment partner  equivalent,  to  coordinate  the  roll  out  of  COVID-19  vaccines  and  integrating \ncoordination mechanism  development partner\u2019s contribution and support into the operational plan.

Development  partner  coordination.  ADB  is  an  active  member  of  several  partner \ncoordination platforms. Development partners acted swiftly to support Pacific islands in mitigating \nCOVID-19  impacts.  Since  the  outbreak  of  the  pandemic,  development  support  has  been \ncoordinated through weekly meetings of the Joint Incident Management Team, chaired by WHO \nPacific, with subgroups to coordinate on specific technical areas of support, such as the vaccines \npillar to coordinate the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine. Discussions around readiness \nassessments and technical support enabled Pacific DMCs to identify priority gaps, needs, and \nissues in planning for COVID-19 vaccine procurement, access, and delivery. Development \npartners are also part of the partner coordination pillar to share opportunities for collaboration and \nfinancial support for vaccines, and for information sharing on COVID-19 vaccine initiatives.11 \nUnder the operational support and logistics pillar, partners such as ADB provided support for \nmedical and personal protective equipment, supplies for testing through GeneXpert distribution, \n \n9 Vaccines Needs Assessments for Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu (accessible from the list of linked documents \nin Appendix 2). \n10 ADB. 2020.

In addition, ADB coordinates through regular \nparticipation in health partners\u2019 meetings led by WHO and the Government of Australia, and is \nrepresented at Pacific Health Ministers\u2019 meetings hosted by WHO and the Pacific Heads of Health \nmeetings convened by the Pacific Community.  \n \n11.  Promoting procurement of safe and effective vaccines. The additional financing \napplies the eligibility criteria for ADB\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine support.12 The COVID-19 vaccines will \nbe procured under the project by UNICEF. They will be selected through COVAX on behalf of \nSamoa,  Tonga,  Tuvalu,  and  Vanuatu,  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  vaccine  eligibility  criteria \n(footnote 12). This will ensure that vaccines being procured promote public health safety, reduce \ndeaths and disease burdens, and minimize societal and economic disruption from the pandemic. \nLetters from the four DMC governors are attached, confirming commitment to the implementation \nof each DMC\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination allocation plan and adherence to ADB\u2019s criteria for vaccine \nsupport.13  \n \n12.  Strategic alignment and modality. The overall project continues to be aligned with \nnational health strategies in all four DMCs, through its commitment to improving public health and \ninfection prevention control.14 It is in line with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030 priorities of reducing poverty \nand inequalities; accelerating progress in gender equality; tackling climate change, building \nclimate  and  disaster  resilience,  and  enhancing  environmental  sustainability;  strengthening \ngovernance and institutional capacity; and fostering regional cooperation and integration.15 It is \nalso consistent with the Pacific Approach, 2016\u20132020 priority of managing risks through stronger \nhealth systems.16 The design of the additional financing follows the project investment component \nof the APVAX policy, and the project applies the diligence, access, and vaccine eligibility \nrequirements, as well as the policy variations applicable to APVAX projects (Table 2). The project \nwill support the procurement of eligible COVID-19 vaccines, and help strengthen health systems \nand increase community awareness. Procurement will be through UNICEF, the lead procurement \nagency under COVAX. All vaccines procured by UNICEF should conform to WHO standards, \nsuch as prequalification, or be granted WHO's Emergency Use Listing.17 \n \nB.  Project Description \n \n13.  With the additional financing, the overall project will have the impact of (i) incidence and \nprevalence  of  cervical  cancer  in  the  Pacific  region  reduced  (Healthy  Islands  Monitoring \nFramework); (ii) healthy lives ensured and well-being for all at all ages promoted (Sustainable \nDevelopment Goal 3);18 and (iii) SARS-Cov2 virus\u2019 spread, morbidity and mortality reduced, and \nconfidence  of  citizens  restored.  It  will  adopt  the  same  outcome  (increased  immunization \n \n12 Eligibility of vaccines for APVAX financing will adhere to the criteria stated in paragraph 29 (including footnotes 28, \n29 and 30) of the APVAX policy (ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Support to Enhance COVID-19 Vaccine Access). As noted within \nthe APVAX policy. DMCs with no national regulatory authority\u2014as is the case for Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and \nVanuatu\u2014are not required to have the national vaccine authorization, but must have accepted responsibility for \nvaccine selection, distribution, and administration in the DMC, and are still required to strengthen vaccine surveillance \nand monitoring. \n13 Governor's letters (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n14 Kingdom of Tonga, Ministry of Health (MOH). 2014.

It will continue its community \nengagement to ensure gender mainstreaming. The performance indicator is revised to include a \ntarget of COVID-19 vaccine coverage for 20% of the population.20 This aligns with the allocation-\nper-population doses under COVAX.21 \n \n14.  Output 1: Regional vaccine procurement strengthened. ADB will continue to support \nSamoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu in procuring the HPV and rotavirus vaccines as well as the \nPCV through UNICEF\u2019s VII. In Tonga, it will also finance the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine \nfrom year 2 through phased counterpart financing, replacing the current measles and rubella \nvaccine.22 The original project is also supporting the procurement of cold chain equipment and \nassociated supplies, with performance, quality, and safety certification recommended by WHO \nand UNICEF; microplanning in at least 90% of health facilities; and national vaccine forecasting, \nwhich  includes  emergency  preparedness  planning  and  maintenance  of  a  buffer  stock. \nProcurement capacity building will contribute to more effective planning and procurement of \nhealth commodities. Under the additional financing, this output will be expanded to include \n(i) procurement through UNICEF\u2014the lead procurement agency of COVAX-allocated COVID-19 \nvaccines for Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu\u2014when one of the APVAX-eligible vaccines \nbecomes available through COVAX allocations;23 and (ii) the upgrade of cold chain capacities, as \nrequired, to accommodate the introduction of the COVID-19 vaccine. The additional financing \nproposed is to target the financing of any cost-shared COVID-19 vaccines to up to 20% of the \npopulation at the onset, in alignment with the 20% allocation under COVAX, with budget for up to \n70% of the population as COVAX-allocated doses are made available in the future. ADB has been \none of the leading financiers of routine vaccines in the four DMCs, and will aim to further expand \nthis support for the roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccines. \n \n15.  Output 2: Health systems strengthened. The overall project will continue to strengthen \nprimary health care and reduce inequities in access to health services. The original project \nsupports  (i)  the  updating  of  immunization  and  cold  chain  policies, guidelines, and  training \nmaterials; (ii) the training of health workers through workshops and on-the-job practice in vaccine \nadministration,  routine  and  adverse-event  reporting,  waste  management,  preventive \nmaintenance, supportive supervision, and supply chain management with the aim of achieving \nless than 10% stockout nationally; (iii) capacity building of health staff in evidence-based planning \nand  bottom-up  budgeting  for  routine  integrated  outreach  with  an  equity  focus;  (iv)  sex-\ndisaggregated immunization reporting that is integrated in the broader health information system; \nand (v) evidence generation through nationwide immunization coverage surveys and other \nsurveys to assess the quality and equity of vaccine management. The additional financing will \nsupport the rollout of the national vaccine deployment plans, including the revision of national \nimmunization policies and guidelines to include the COVID-19 vaccine; expanded training for \nvaccinators on the COVID-19 vaccine; microplanning to identify and target population segments \nfor the COVID-19 vaccine rollout; and supplementary immunization activities for rapid catch-up \ncampaigns.

Output 3: Community awareness improved. Leveraging existing community structures \nand communication channels, the project team will continue to assist the ministries of health in \nimproving the population\u2019s knowledge of and attitude toward vaccines, and promoting better \nhealth-seeking behavior and vaccine acceptance. In doing so, the team is building partnerships \nwith other ministries (e.g., education and women\u2019s affairs), nongovernment and civil society \norganizations, community and church leaders, and other local community groups. The additional \nfinancing  will  strengthen  community  engagement,  through  UNICEF,  in  the  rollout  of \ncommunication  campaigns  on  infection  prevention  control,  demand  generation,  vaccine \nacceptance, as well as targeted risk communication on the national COVID-19 vaccine strategy \nto minimize potential vaccine hesitancy or misinformation.  \n \nC.  Value Added by ADB \n \n17.  Several development partners have committed to support Pacific island countries\u2019 access \nto COVID-19 vaccines. where UNICEF, WHO, the World Bank, and the governments of Australia \nand New Zealand are represented in COVAX, and supported the pooling of resources toward the \nAMC for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine.24 ADB\u2019s project provides an established \nplatform to introduce the COVID-19 vaccine in the four DMCs, which the additional financing can \nhelp secure. A COVID-19 vaccine will contribute to immunization as a regional public good and \npromote collaboration through pooled procurement. ADB is coordinating regional knowledge \nsharing on the development of COVID-19 vaccines and, as of 16 March 2021, had approved \nabout $756 million, including in cofinancing and technical assistance, to support Pacific countries' \nresponse to the pandemic.25 These initiatives\u2014including the emergency procurement of essential \nmedical supplies and equipment, and direct support to multisector COVID-19 preparedness and \nresponse plans\u2014will complement the proposed introduction of a COVID-19 vaccine in mitigating \nand containing the spread of COVID-19 and accelerating recovery from the pandemic.26  \n  \nD.

Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  The implementation arrangements under the additional financing will remain the same as \nin the original project, i.e., the ministries of finance in Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu will be \nthe executing agencies, and the respective MOHs will be the implementing agencies. Project \nmanagement support will be provided by the already-appointed integrated project management \n(IPM) team, which will be expanded to provide additional support. UNICEF will continue to provide \nvaccine and cold chain procurement and expert services.  \n \n22.  Under the additional financing, UNICEF will support COVID-19 vaccine procurement, \nnational immunization planning, training, and risk communication, while WHO will be engaged to \nsupport monitoring and safety surveillance. The procurement of vaccines, cold chain equipment, \nand associated services will be carried out in accordance with UNICEF\u2019s Supply Manual and its \nHuman Resources Manual.30 The additional financing will support the countries in strengthening \ntheir vaccine coverage monitoring, reporting, and surveillance by recruiting consultants provided \nthrough the IPM firm.  \n \n23.  For  goods  and  consulting  services  not  procured  or  recruited  through  UNICEF, \nprocurement will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2015, as amended from \ntime to time) and Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time), in \nalignment with the original project.31 The contracting arrangements put into place under the \nn\ncurrent financing are fully adequate and will be maintained for the proposed activities under the \nadditional financing. As the project follows the access criteria, vaccine eligibility and due diligence \nrequirements established under the APVAX policy, the project also adopts the policy variations \napproved under the APVAX policy, including those for universal procurement and retroactive \nfinancing. The continued engagement with UNICEF represents value for money due to their \norganization\u2019s strategic position for immunization support in the Pacific. \n \n24.  The implementation arrangements are summarized in Table 5 and described in detail in \nthe PAM (footnote 30). Vaccines and cold chain equipment will be procured through UNICEF by \nexpanding the scope of the current agreements between the governments and UNICEF, and the \ncontracts of the implementation consultant and individual consultants will be varied to cover the \nextension in time and scope related to the additional financing. \n \nTable 5: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nImplementation period  March 2021\u2013November 2023 \nEstimated completion date  30 November 2023 \nEstimated grants closing date  31 May 2024 \nManagement \n(i)  Oversight body  Samoa: Health Program Advisory Committee \nTonga: National Health Development Committee \nTuvalu: HIV/Tuberculosis Steering Committee \nVanuatu: Ministry of Health Executive Committee \n(ii)  Executing agency  Samoa: Ministry of Finance \nTonga: Ministry of Finance  \n \n30 ADB. 2010.

DUE DILIGENCE  \n \n25.  Through strategic investments in both vaccine procurement and activities to strengthen \nhealth systems in the overall project, the expected outcome of broader immunization coverage \nand greater efficiency of primary health care will benefit more than 583,700 people across Samoa, \nTonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Neighboring Pacific countries are likely to benefit from increased \nregional immunization coverage, fewer transboundary infections, and improved surveillance, \nwhich are all expected to contribute to regional cooperation and integration. \n \nA.  Technical \n \n26.  The additional financing will strengthen the countries\u2019 responses to health emergencies, \nsuch as the COVID-19 pandemic, by helping supply a vaccine that will reduce the risk of getting \nthe life-threatening disease by disrupting the transmission chain and preventing its spread, and \nbuild a resilient health system to provide rapid access to vaccines. Investments in vaccines and \nimmunization programs are established as being a most cost-effective health measure, and are \ntimely given that many Pacific countries have remained free of confirmed COVID-19 cases. \n \n27.  UNICEF and WHO will continue to support the four DMCs in (i) updating or revising \nnational immunization programs and public health policies; (ii) upgrading cold chain capacities \nand supply chain networks, procurement capacity, information systems, and fiscal management \ncapacity in the health sector; and (iii) strengthening the capacity of the respective MOHs. UNICEF \nand WHO have advised that each MOH has sufficient staff and logistics capacity to manage the \nintroduction of COVID-19 vaccines.  \n \n28.  ADB is closely coordinating with development partners (para. 10) to ensure that financing \nand technical support for the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines are aligned.32  \n \n \n32Health coordination meetings include the participation of ADB, Australia, New Zealand, the Pacific Community, \n  \nUNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank. The Pacific Community, formerly the South Pacific Commission, is an \ninternational development organization owned and governed by 26 country and territory members, including Samoa, \nTonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. \n ", "11 \nB.  Economic and Financial Viability \n \n29.  Economic analysis. Most project resources will be allocated to the procurement of \nvaccines and health infrastructure upgrades (cold chain, health facility assets, and staff training). \nThese will translate into better health outcomes by reducing the burden of disease, and into long-\nterm cost savings and potential economic growth. The project has a pro-poor and equity focus by \nstrengthening health services in remote areas. The economic benefits accrue from (i) savings for \nhouseholds from less out-of-pocket spending on health care, and (ii) benefits from disability-\nadjusted life years saved. Given that the health-related nature of the project makes it difficult to \nquantify the monetary value of project benefits, a cost-effectiveness analysis was carried out. An \nincremental  cost-effectiveness  ratio  (dollars  per  disability-adjusted  life  year  averted)  was \ncalculated for each vaccine in each country. The addition of the COVID-19 vaccines to the rollout \nof the other three vaccines (para. 13) remains cost-effective for all four countries.33 \n \n30.  Financial analysis. An updated project financial analysis was conducted in accordance \nwith ADB guidelines, and the project remains financially sustainable.34 A financial viability analysis \nis not required for projects that do not include revenue-generating activities.  \n \nC.  Sustainability \n \n31.  The fiscal conditions in all four DMCs could worsen because of the COVID-19 pandemic, \nbut  in  a  review  mission  conducted  in  October  2020  the  governments  confirmed that  their \ncounterpart funding remains manageable. The financial sustainability of the project will be sought \nthrough measures such as factoring in forecast needs for routine vaccines and cold chain \nreplenishment in national health budgets, and phasing the financing of vaccine procurement. By \nexpanding preventive health care, the project will reduce future health costs. \n \nD.  Governance \n \n32.  Project-related governance risks were assessed in accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement \nand financial management requirements.35 The recruitment of the IPM team with in-country and \nregional procurement specialists will mitigate the risk of MOH staff having limited procurement \ncapacity. Complex procurement actions under the project will be undertaken by UNICEF, which \nhas extensive experience in global vaccine procurement. The financial management risk rating is \nmoderate for Samoa and Tonga, substantial for Tuvalu, and high for Vanuatu. Detailed financial \nmanagement action plans have been developed to manage identified risks and ensure effective \nimplementation with the support of the IPM. The IPM will also help conduct independent biannual \nfiduciary reviews, provide targeted technical assistance to develop capacity for ADB procedures \nand financial monitoring, and establish separate project accounts. \n \n33.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the ministries of finance and the ministries of health of Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. \nThe policy requirements and supplementary measures are described in the PAM (footnote 30). \n \n \n33  Financial Analysis and Economic Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). Results show \nan incremental cost\u2013effectiveness ratio of between 1\u20133 times gross domestic product per capita across all four \ncountries, indicating that the vaccination program as a whole will remain cost-effective. \n34  ADB. 2019.

Poverty, Social, and Gender \n \n34.  The project is classified gender equity. The additional financing will support the safe \nintroduction of a COVID-19 vaccine. This will particularly benefit women who are at increased risk \nof infection because of their roles as health workers (who will be prioritized for the vaccine), other \nfrontline workers, and carers. A reduction in mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases will bring \nsignificant socioeconomic benefits. A revised gender action plan was agreed with the respective \ngovernments to support the overall project outcome of increasing HPV vaccine coverage for girls \naged 9\u201314 years, PCV and rotavirus vaccine coverage for birth cohorts of both sexes, and \nCOVID-19 vaccine population coverage targets.36 Other targets include (i) gender-responsive \nmicroplans, (ii) training for at least 50% of female health providers on introducing and managing \nnew vaccines, (iii) gender-responsive community mobilization strategies, (iv) activities to promote \nadolescent  reproductive  health  with  gender  equity  considerations,  and  (v)  nationwide  sex-\ndisaggregated  immunization  reporting.37  The  additional  financing  will  also  support  sex-\ndisaggregated vaccine surveillance data and gender-sensitive health promotion activities with a \nfocus on hand hygiene and infection control.38 \n \nF.  Safeguards \n \n35.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the additional financing will \nretain its original project\u2019s categorization of C for environment, involuntary resettlement, and \nindigenous peoples.39 No physical works will be undertaken, so the additional financing will not \ncreate adverse environmental impacts. The overall project (i) will fund the management of waste \nfrom cold chain equipment and biomedical supplies, and support training on waste management; \nand (ii) will not introduce any additional risk to the occupational health and safety of health care \nworkers. The overall project will not cause any physical and economic displacement, or affect any \ndistinct and vulnerable group of indigenous peoples as defined by ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy \nStatement. An assessment matrix was prepared, and no mitigation measure is required.40 \nF\n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n36.  The overall risk assessment is moderate for Samoa and Vanuatu, and low for Tonga and \nTuvalu. Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 6 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan (footnote 36). \n \nTable 6: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Ratings  Mitigation Measures \nWeak financial  Substantial: Tuvalu  The  IPM  team  will  assist  each  MOH  in  financial  reporting, \nmanagement  High: Vanuatu  procurement, and budget planning.
