INTRODUCTION \n1.   In October 2011, the Government of Thailand asked the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nto help prepare an international forum for countries to share experience and knowledge on flood \nmanagement  and  response.  ADB,  in  cooperation  with  the  National  Economic  and  Social \nDevelopment Board (NESDB), organized the forum during 19\u201320 January 2012. Subsequently, \nNESDB requested ADB to provide technical support for select key areas of the government\u2019s \nMaster Plan on Water Resources Management, approved in January 2012. In response, ADB \nincluded the proposed technical assistance (TA) in its country operations business plan, 2013\u2013\n2015 for Thailand.1 ADB fielded a reconnaissance mission in March and a fact-finding mission in \nJune 2012, and reached agreements with NESDB, the Office of the National Water and Flood \nManagement Policy (ONWF), and the Royal Irrigation Department (RID) on the scope, impact, \noutcome, outputs, implementation arrangements, costs, and financial arrangements for the TA.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  During the last quarter of 2011, Thailand experienced its worst flooding since 1942. The \nfloods affected almost 14 million people in 65 of Thailand\u2019s 77 provinces, with widespread \ndamage and loss to homes, factories, businesses, transport and energy infrastructure, social \nservice facilities, and crops and livestock. The Ministry of Finance estimates the total economic \ndamage and loss caused by the floods at approximately $45 billion. Manufacturing experienced \nthe most damage and loss, which is estimated at $32 billion.  \n \n3.  The  government  responded  to  the  2011  floods  with  measures  to  strengthen  flood \nmanagement in the overall context of water resources management. In January 2012, it passed \nthe Master Plan on Water Resources Management and an emergency decree for the borrowing \nof B350 billion3 for investment in flood and water management projects. It set up the National \nWater Resources and Flood Policy Committee (NWFPC), chaired by the Prime Minister, to \nformulate policies in accordance with the master plan; and the Water and Flood Management \nCommission (WFMC), which reports to the NWFPC. The WFMC, chaired by the minister of \nsciences  and  technology,  is  responsible  for  formulating  action  plans  and  approving  water \nmanagement investment projects, monitoring their implementation, and evaluating their impact. \nThe NWFPC and the WFMC include representatives from all relevant line agencies. The Office \nof the National Water and Flood Management Policy (ONWF) was established under the Prime \nMinister\u2019s Office to serve as an operating arm and secretariat to the NWFPC and the WFMC.   \n \n4.  The government recognizes that flood management must be closely linked with broader \nissues of water resources management. The master plan calls for an integrated approach to \ninvestment  in  projects  related  to  water  management.  It  includes  action  plans  for  urgent \nmeasures to be implemented by 2012 and for activities beyond 2012. Activities are organized \nunder  eight  major  themes:  (i)  restoration  and  conservation  of  forests  and  ecosystems;  \n(ii)  management  of  major  water  reservoirs  and  formulation  of  a  national  annual  water \nmanagement plan; (iii) restoration and efficiency improvement of current and planned physical \nstructures; (iv) development of an information warehouse, forecasting, and disaster warning \nsystem; (v) response to specific geographical areas; (vi) designation of water retention areas \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Country Operations Business Plan: Thailand, 2013\u20132015. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 27 November 2012.  \n3  According to the emergency decree, the borrowing must be completed by 30 June 2013; the investment can be \ncompleted after that date. \n ", "2   \nand recovery measures; (vii) improvement of water management institutions; and (viii) creation \nof stakeholder awareness, acceptance, and participation in flood management. \n \n5.  Guided by the master plan, the government is inviting submission of a conceptual plan \nfor  the  design  of  infrastructure  for  sustainable  water  resources  management  and  flood \nprevention from international communities. The WFMC chair is responsible for evaluating bids \nand supervising implementation of the subsequent investment projects. ONWF, as the WFMC \nsecretariat, is responsible for preparing the groundwork for bid evaluation, coordinating with the \nwinning bidder and all relevant line agencies in implementing projects, and monitoring and \nevaluating output and outcome of all water management projects.  \n \n6.  To ensure overall project relevance and feasibility in the context of the master plan, each \ninvestment project must be prepared, appraised, implemented, monitored, and evaluated in \nrelation to integrated water resources and flood management principles, following a standard \nset of project guidelines.4 Water and flood management projects that focus only on localized \nconditions fail to take account of the downstream impact; therefore, basin wide impacts need to \nbe identified prior to any project approval. Plans must also be adjusted to fully integrate with the \noverall master plan for water and flood management. ONWF must be able to identify and \nmanage these issues. The government recognizes that appraisal, monitoring, and evaluation of \nwater and flood management projects need to be carried out with oversight from senior national \nbodies, including NESDB, ONWF, and the Public Debt Management Office (PDMO).5 With \nimproved project proposal screening, monitoring, and evaluation, the cabinet will be able to \nmake more informed decisions on integrated water resources and flood management based on \nsystematic analysis and reporting from NESDB and ONWF. \n \n7.  The  Yom  River  basin  is  an  important  upper  Chao  Phraya  watershed  needing \nstrengthened regulation, as well as structural and nonstructural water management and flood \ncontrol measures. Currently, the main stream of the Yom River has no structure to regulate \nwater. Many studies have been prepared on options for structural measures  in the basin. \nHowever, relevant agencies acknowledge that the studies do not address several aspects, such \nas adequate assessment of the social, ecological, and economic impacts of the proposed \ninvestment  alternatives.  Proposed  construction  of  reservoirs  in  the  Yom  River  basin  has \nresulted in protests by communities that may be affected. For effective implementation of water \nmanagement  projects  within  the  basin,  additional  reviews,  studies,  and  consultations  are \nneeded to enable selection of the most technically, economically, and socially feasible options. \nThe  2011  floods  brought  new  recognition  among  Yom  River  communities  of  the  need  to \nconsider better management of the basin. In addition, both the community and the government \nmust realize that any structural measures in the Yom River basin should be considered in the \ncontext  of  overall  water  resources  management.  In  2008,  ADB  supported  pilot  and \ndemonstration activities in the Yom River basin, which developed a network of communities and \na  stakeholder  participation  process.6  The  proposed  TA  is  well  placed  to  build  on  recent \ndevelopments in integrated water resources management and to ensure that stakeholders are \neffectively engaged in developing the Yom River basin road map and assessing development \noptions.   \n                                                \n4  Integrated water resources and flood management principles are the step-by-step process of managing water \nresources to achieve water security-for-all, and managing the risks of too much or too little water, including \npreventing and mitigating water-related disasters. \n5  The Public Debt Management Office is responsible for borrowing under the emergency decree to finance water and \nflood management projects. The office will use the disbursement benchmark to monitor project progress. \n6  ADB. 2008. Piloting an Adaptive Approach to Implement Integrated Water Resources Management in the Yom \nRiver Basin.

The outcome will be an \nimproved decision-making process for integrated water resources management, focusing on \nflood management.   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA has two components.  \n \n10.  Component  1:  Develop  planning  and  implementation  guidelines  for  water \nmanagement project assessment, monitoring, and evaluation. The TA will help ONWF \ndevelop  guidelines,  checklists,  and  a  management  information  system  for  assessing, \nmonitoring,  and  evaluating  proposed  national,  provincial,  and  local  government  flood \nmanagement projects in the context of the Master Plan for Water Resources Management. This \nis to ensure that proposals are consistent with the principles and context of the integrated water \nresources and flood management approach and plans. The component has two outputs. \n  \n11.  Output 1: Guidelines and checklist for water management programs and projects. \nThe TA team will (i) undertake a review of current water resources and flood management \npolicy  and  planning  procedures  in  Thailand,  including  relevant  legislation  and  regulations;  \n(ii) study the current strategy for reducing flood risk and the proposed program of works and \nmeasures ready for implementation under the master plan; (iii) prepare guidelines for good \npractice for water management project planning; and (iv) develop a checklist for ONWF to \nassess project implementation readiness, taking into consideration integration with the Master \nPlan for Water Resources Management and broader aspects of water resources management, \nincluding water conservation and water supply; and with safeguards necessary to secure social \nand environmental outcomes. Training workshops will be conducted to introduce the guidelines \nfor good practice in water management to key government and nongovernment stakeholders in \nwater resources management. \n \n12.  Output  2:  Guidelines  and  management  information  system  for  monitoring \nimplementation and evaluating impacts of water management programs and projects. \nThe TA team will (i) develop a set of guidelines for monitoring implementation and evaluating \nimpacts  of  post-implementation  phases  of  water  management  projects  to  ensure  effective \nintegration and management, assess how well the intended benefits of projects and programs \nare being realized, identify associated problems and/or issues, and propose remedial measures \nwhere required; (ii) develop a management information system for monitoring implementation \nand evaluating impacts that will integrate data and information available from existing platforms \nand  systems  of  relevant  agencies,  analyze  data  according  to  specifications  using  data \nvisualization  techniques,  and  generate  required  reports  and  executive  summaries;  and  \n(iii) conduct workshops on the use of the guidelines and management information system. \n \n13.  Component 2: Review water management options and strengthen the participation \nprocess for the Yom River basin. The TA will (i) demonstrate an integrated approach to flood \nand water management through a pilot study of the Yom River basin; (ii) provide frameworks for \nwater assessments and system analysis, and update existing information; and (iii) build on \nearlier  stakeholder  consultations  and  institutional  development  work  to  develop  innovative \napproaches and sustainable mechanisms for participation. The component has three outputs. \n ", "4   \n14.  Output 3: Water resources assessment and systems analysis guidance for the \nYom River basin. To update the assessment of basin water resources, the TA will (i) review \nprevious  studies  on  water  storage  in  the  basin,  considering  flood  management  and \nstrengthening  of  water  supply  security,  and  (ii)  identify  information  gaps  and  recommend \nappropriate methodology to updating assessments of current and future demand for water in the \nbasin. \n \n15.  Output 4: Framework for systems analysis of surface and groundwater in the Yom \nRiver basin. The TA will recommend (i) appropriate methodology and approaches for analysis \nof  alternative  storage  and/or  a  combination  of  storage  for  mitigation  of  flood  and  drought \nimpacts, and (ii) an appropriate evaluation technique for the potential role of upland water \nconservation,  soil  and  run-off  management,  and  reforestation  to  improve  flood  and  water \nresources management.  \n \n16.  Output 5: Yom River basin consultative process and participation mechanism. The \nTA will facilitate a revived consultation process between communities in the river basin and \nrelevant government agencies, academia, and civil society. It will support the design of a \nconsultation process and train government agencies, academia, and civil society to engage \nstakeholders  in  identifying  and  defining  basin  management  objectives,  water  management \nstrategies,  and  investment  alternatives.  The  findings  of  earlier  economic,  social,  and \nenvironmental impact studies will be communicated to communities and relevant agencies to \ncreate a shared understanding. Through lessons from the consultative process, appropriate \nsocial and environmental safeguards and monitoring and evaluation programs will be proposed. \nThe TA will document the consultative process and lessons to serve as examples for other river \nbasins.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, of which $1,500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction and administered by ADB. The Government of \nThailand will provide counterpart support in the form of office accommodation, communication \nfacilities,  information  technology  platform  and  server,  counterpart  staff,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing plan are presented in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  NESDB will be the executing agency. For component 1, ONWF will be the implementing \nagency. The TA will also work closely with the Public Debt Management Office to develop \nmonitoring and evaluation guidelines and the information technology-based system. The WFMC \nwill  provide  strategic  guidance  for  TA  implementation.  For  component  2,  RID  will  be  the \nimplementing agency. TA implementation offices will be established in ONWF and RID. A TA \nproject steering committee will be established and chaired by NESDB, with all relevant agencies, \nincluding Department of Water Resources, ONWF, PDMO, and RID, represented as members.  \n \n19.  The TA is tentatively scheduled for implementation from December 2012 to December \n2014. A consulting firm and two individual consultants will be recruited to undertake the TA \nactivities; about 73 person-months of consulting services will be required, comprising 19 person-\nmonths of international and 54 person-months of national consulting services.
