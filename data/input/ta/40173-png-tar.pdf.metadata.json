The Government of Papua New Guinea (PNG) has requested Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) technical assistance (TA) for preparing the Highlands Highway (Southern Highlands and \nEnga  Network)  Rehabilitation  Project1 for  possible  ADB  financing.  Discussions  with  the \nDepartment of National Planning and Monitoring (DNPM), Department of Works (DOW), and \nDepartment of Transport (DOT) on the scope, implementation arrangements, cost estimates, \nand outline terms of reference were conducted during the Fact-Finding Mission on 6\u201315 March \n2007. The TA is included in the nonlending program for 2007 in the 2006\u20132010 PNG country \nstrategy and program (CSP).2 The proposed ensuing project is included in the lending program \nfor 2008 in the CSP. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  PNG is an archipelago consisting of rugged mountain ranges, fertile upland valleys, \ncoastal plains, and extensive swamps. It has a coastline of over 17,000 kilometers (km) and 17 \nmillion hectares of reef-covered coastal waters. Of 19 mainland provinces, 13 are coastal \nprovinces. Due to PNG\u2019s geography, the population lives in widely dispersed pockets, limiting \nmobility  and  opportunities  to  develop  the  domestic  markets.  For  example,  its  capital  Port \nMoresby is not connected by road to any other major city. \n \n3.  Infrastructure in all three subsectors (land, air and water) of PNG\u2019s multimodal transport \nsystem has fallen steadily into a state of disrepair in the past two decades. The resulting poor \ncondition of facilities hinders access to markets and social services for much of the population, \nimposes high costs on business activities, and constrains both labor employment and expansion \nin investment in the country. \n \n4.  In the roads subsector, thousands of kilometers of minor rural roads built between 1950 \nand 1970, roads connecting rural areas with the main road networks, are now in an advanced \nstage of deterioration. About half of all feeder roads in the country are impassable to vehicles \ncarrying significant loads. Sealed roads have degenerated to poor gravel roads; gravel roads \nhave been reduced to earth tracks; and some routes have closed altogether. Only about 37% of \nthe national road network (about 8,400 km) is in a maintainable condition (i.e., can receive \nroutine maintenance attention). About half the network requires some significant rehabilitation, \nrestoration, or reconstruction to make the roads trafficable. Much of the past investment in road \nrehabilitation and upgrading has been lost through neglect of subsequent maintenance.3 \n \n5.  The major factors contributing to the poor state of the road infrastructure have been (i) \nlarge shortfalls in the funding provided for maintenance, and (ii) weaknesses in managing and \ndelivering  maintenance  services.  To  reverse  these  impediments  to  the  development  of  a \nsoundly functioning road subsector, a program of financing, structural, and institutional reforms \nneed to be adopted and successfully implemented. \n \n6.  The Government recognizes that the decline in the quality of the country\u2019s transport \ninfrastructure has had \u201ca major adverse impact on service delivery and the capacity of Papua \n                                                 \n1   The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 26 March 2007. \n2   ADB. 2006. Country Strategy and Program (2006-2010): Papua New Guinea. Manila. \n3  ADB. Midterm Report, Technical Assistance to Papua New Guinea for Road Authority Development. Manila (TA \n3716-PNG para. 24). \n ", "2   \nNew  Guineans  to  earn  cash  incomes.\u201d 4  Accordingly,  in  its  2005\u20132010  Medium-Term \nDevelopment Strategy (MTDS),5 the Government states that maintenance and rehabilitation \nprograms for roads, wharves, and airstrips, particularly in rural areas, will be a powerful force for \neconomic growth and development by linking markets and reducing costs.6 Consistent with this \nanalysis, the rehabilitation and maintenance of transport infrastructure are identified in the \nMTDS as the first-listed sectoral expenditure priority for 2005\u22122010.   \n \n7.  Building  on  this  theme,  PNG\u2019s  National  Transport  Development  Plan  (NTDP)7 for \n2001\u22122010 was revised in 2005, and approved by the Government in 2006, to \u201censure [that] it \nappropriately reflects and articulates MTDS direction and priorities.\u201d8  Hence, the first of the \nNTDP\u2019s  four  major  strategies  is  \u201cto  maintain  and  improve  the  existing  infrastructure  and \nservices.\u201d9 Moreover,  the  NTDP  recognizes  the  importance  of  and  need  for  institutional \nstrengthening  to  enable  the  realization  of  its strategies.10 Thus,  the NTDP  (i)  provides  for \nexpenditure on maintenance works in each of the three modes, and (ii) anticipates progress with \nthe structural reforms. The NTDP specifies particular parts of the transport infrastructure for \nrehabilitation and reconstruction, and lists 15 roads of national importance for improvement. The \nHighlands Highway is the first.  \n \n8.  The approval of the revised NTDP provides a significant opportunity to enhance the \neffectiveness of partnerships between the Government and its main development partners, \nmany  of  whom  are  currently  working  on  developing  new  programs.  Opportunities  exist  to \nharmonize  or  better  coordinate  program  planning,  project  and  program  management \narrangements and processes and procedures such as financial management, reporting, and \nprocurement.  Particular  opportunities  exist  as  the  Australian  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment (AusAID) shifts from stand-alone project-based assistance to a Transport Sector \nSupport Program (TSSP), which will operate through DOW\u2015a transition is under way. Ideally, \nprogress on these issues should be led by the Government. As an initial step, the Government, \nAusAID, ADB, and World Bank are conducting a transport sector harmonization study that is \nexpected to be completed by mid-2007. \n \n9.  The Highlands Region is strategically important for the country, as it is richly endowed \nwith natural and tourism resources, ecological conditions for farming, and is home to almost half \nof the population. Developing the infrastructure network in this region will have a significant \nimpact on PNG\u2019s overall economic and social performance. The country\u2019s most significant road, \nthe Highlands Highway, runs through the region, bringing to Lae Port copper, coffee, and tea \n(the country\u2019s major export items) and distributing in the region imports ranging from heavy \n                                                 \n4   Ministry  of  National  Planning  and  Monitoring,  Government  of  Papua  New  Guinea.  2004.

All major gas and oil fields, and gold mines are located in the western areas \nof  Southern  Highlands  and  Enga  provinces.  The  NTDP  is  proposing  the  upgrading  and \nrehabilitation of the road to restore it to transit condition. \n \n10.  There are ongoing maintenance and rehabilitation efforts on the Highlands Highway \nfrom Lae Port in Morobe Province to Magarima in Southern Highlands Province. In 2005, the \nGovernment through DOW set aside K225 million for multiyear maintenance contracts until   \n2009. It is currently working on sections from the Chimbu-Eastern Highlands provinces\u2019 border \nto Mendi, capital of Southern Highlands Province. ADB is assisting the Government in improving \nthe section from Mendi to Magarima.11 With the support of AusAID, DOW is conducting routine \nmaintenance on sections from the Chimbu-Eastern Highlands provinces\u2019 border to the port city \nof  Lae,  capital  of  Morobe  Province.  The  Government  has  requested  ADB  to  assist  in \nrehabilitating the sections from Magarima to Koroba in Southern Highlands Province, along with \nother important links to the Highlands Highway in Enga Province. The proposed improvements \nwill complete the missing sections of the main road network of the two provinces that are \ncurrently being rehabilitated with funding from ADB loans.12 \n \n11.  The  rehabilitation  of  the  Highlands  Highway,  given  its  importance,  is  a  unique \nopportunity  for  the  Government  and  the  funding  partners  to  work  together  to  achieve \ndevelopment results. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  TA  aims  to  prepare  the  Highlands  Highway  (Southern  Highlands  and  Enga \nProvinces  Network)  Rehabilitation  Project  to  support  economic  growth  through  increased \nexports and integration of the Highlands Region subsistence population into the mainstream \neconomy by improving rural access to market centers. The TA outcome will be the agreed-upon \ndesign and feasibility study for a road improvement project suitable for ADB financing. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n13.  The TA will prepare (i) a feasibility study that includes the project rationale and scope, \ntechnical and economic appraisal, assessment of environmental and social impacts; and (ii) \nproject implementation arrangements, and costing and financing plan for ADB assistance. Road \nsections of about 250 km to be considered for improvement under the proposed project, are all \nlocated on the existing alignment. Land acquisition and resettlement are expected to be non- \nsignificant. No issues involving indigenous people are expected. The environmental impact of \nthe project is expected to be minimal. The initial poverty and social analysis is presented in \nAppendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n11    ADB. 1999.

The  key  activities  will  include  (i)  developing  the  project  rationale;  (ii)  assessing \ninstitutional,  engineering,  economic,  social,  and  environmental  aspects;  (iii)  consulting  with \nstakeholders to ensure community participation; (iv) preparing a preliminary engineering design \nand project cost estimates; (v) assessing economic viability and compliance with safeguards; \n(vi)  preparing  the  financing  plan;  (vii)  defining  the  project  scope;  and  (viii)  preparing  the \nprocurement plan and implementation arrangements. A team of consultants will be recruited to \ncarry out the tasks. They will complete project documentation for further ADB loan processing \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $500,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. The Government \nwill finance the balance of the cost, equivalent to $185,000, by providing office accommodation, \nsupport facilities, counterpart staff, surveys, local transportation, and other logistical support. \nThe Government has been informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance \nany ensuing project. The detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  DOW will be the Executing Agency for the TA and will provide counterpart staff to \ncoordinate TA activities and work with the consultants on a daily basis. A steering committee \nwith members from DNPM, DOW, and DOT will be established to oversee TA implementation. \nDOW will ensure that the services and facilities that the Government is committed to contribute, \nincluding counterpart staff, office accommodation, and administrative resources, are provided \non time to the consultants. DOW through its Road Asset Management Systems (RAMS)13 Unit \nwill  also  provide  the  consultant  with  prefeasibility  information  on  the  road  sections  to  be \nconsidered for the study, including traffic counts, geometric and geotechnical survey data, \npreliminary costs. All equipment to be used under the TA will be procured by the consultants \naccording to ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time) and will be \nturned over to DOW upon completion of the TA. \n \n17.  The TA will require 15 person-months of international consulting services to carry out the \ntasks as described in the outline terms of reference (Appendix 4). The consultants will include a \nteam  leader/institutional/transport  specialist  (6  person-months),  a  road  engineer  (4  person-\nmonths), a social development specialist with experience in consultation and participation (3 \nperson-months),  and  an  environmental  specialist  (2  person-months).  The  TA  will  be \nimplemented  over  12 months,  starting  October  2007  and  ending  in  September  2008.  The \nconsultants will work on an intermittent basis. The international consulting firm will be recruited \nby ADB in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time), using its fixed budget selection method. A simplified technical proposal will \nbe used to invite and evaluate proposals from the international consulting firm.  \n \n                                                 \n13     ADB. 1998.

No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in Papua New Guinea: \n \nPapua New Guinea (PNG) ranks 68th in the United Nations Development Programme poverty index. \nWorld Bank projections in 2005 showed that the proportion of the poor living under the national poverty \nline was 53% in 2003. PNG\u2019s main social indicators, such as life expectancy and maternal and child \nmortality rates, are still well below averages for lower middle-income countries. PNG has limited health \ncare and there are serious public health risks from endemic diseases such as malaria and a generalized \nHIV/AIDS epidemic. Participation in primary schooling has been improving, but the rate is still lower than \nthat in other countries in the region. \n \nAlthough PNG has abundant natural resources including (i) mineral reserves, (ii) forestry and fishery \nassets, (iii) vast agricultural lands with potential for expansion, and (iv) several potential ecological and \ncultural tourism locations, its economic performance has remained below expected levels. Economic \ngrowth has not kept pace with population growth. Most of the population depends on subsistence farming \nsupplemented by cash crops. Only 15\u201320% live in the main urban areas of Port Moresby, Lae, Madang, \nMt. Hagan, and Goroka.  \n \nThe impact of road construction on poverty reduction can be measured by the (i) increased access of rural \ncommunities to basic social services such as education, health care, and local markets; (ii) increased \nemployment opportunities for unskilled workers in the project area; (iii) indirect and induced economic \ngrowth in the project-affected regions and the nation as a whole; and (iv) anticipated reductions in \ntransportation costs to road passengers, freight users, and vehicle operators. The poor condition of the \nroads has led to a decline in the availability of both public and private means of transport along them such \nthat most people can no longer regularly access services and markets in urban centers. Rehabilitating the \nHighlands Highway and nearby corridors would significantly ease access to a wider range of services and \nstimulate economic activity, especially cash cropping. This, in turn, will directly contribute to reducing \npoverty in the target populations. \n \nThe proposed Highlands Highway (Southern Highlands and Enga Provinces Network) Rehabilitation \nProject  is  in  line  with  the  Government\u2019s  Medium-Term  Development  Strategy,  which  highlights  the \nimportance of export-driven economic growth, rural development, and poverty reduction, including the \npromotion of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \n \nThe project will reduce poverty in the short term by creating jobs for skilled and unskilled construction workers. The \nproject will essentially improve access to markets for cash crops and other agricultural products. \n \nThe consultant for the project preparatory technical assistance will conduct a socioeconomic and poverty assessment \namong stakeholders and prepare poverty profiles for project stakeholders. Information to be gathered will include \nemployment status, asset and resource ownership, income data, degree of skills and knowledge base, social \ncohesion, and community organization. The assessment will also identify vital needs and constraints faced by local \ncommunities in fully benefiting from the employment and business opportunities associated with the anticipated \nincrease in road traffic and connectivity, as well as their ability to respond to the inherent health and/or HIV/AIDS risks \nassociated with the road rehabilitation. \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nC.
