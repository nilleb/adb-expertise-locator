INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  During  the  2010  country  programming  mission,  the  Government  of  the  People\u2019s \nRepublic  of  China  (PRC)  requested  that  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  provide \nGuangdong  Province  (Guangdong)  with  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  help  formulate  a \nsustainable provincial development strategy. The policy advisory technical assistance project for \nGuangdong continues a series of similar projects in diverse provinces in the PRC. ADB first \napproved a TA project of this kind for Hebei Province in 2003. Encouraged by the success of \nthat project, the government requested that ADB develop a systematic approach to support \nprovincial development strategies. Since then, seven TA projects have been approved covering \nAnhui Province, Chongqing Municipality, Gansu Province, Guizhou Province, Hebei Province, \nHeilongjiang Province, Hubei Province, Hunan Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, \nJiangxi Province, Jilin Province, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.1  \n \n2.  An analysis as to the effectiveness of the provincial development strategies concluded \nthat the previous TA successfully supported development of provincial strategies.2 Major factors \ncontributing to its success included adequate identification of the main development priorities in \neach province, engagement and full ownership of senior provincial officers, and reliance on the \ncombined expertise of national and international consultants. Several of the resulting policy \nrecommendations have been reflected in socioeconomic development plans at both the central \nand local government levels and implemented in different provinces. For example, several \npolicy recommendations under the Hebei provincial development strategy were adopted by \nHebei  Province,  Beijing  Municipality,  and  Tianjin  Municipality  in  connection  with  plans  to \nimprove environmental standards and further boost socioeconomic development.  \n \n3.  Dialogue  with  the  Guangdong  provincial  authorities  and  representatives  from  the \nMinistry of Finance clarified the policy and institutional context, as well as priorities for ADB \nsupport.  Agreement  was  reached  on  the  impact,  outcome,  outputs,  implementation \narrangements, costs and financing arrangements, and terms of reference for the TA.3 The \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Guangdong has progressed remarkably since the start of the PRC\u2019s economic reform in \n1978,  successfully  transforming  itself  from  an  agriculture  producer  into  a  dynamic \nmanufacturing-based economy. The largest economy and most populous province in the PRC \n(with 104 million residents), Guangdong grew at an annual average rate of 13.4% from 1978 to \n2010. The province is also the most urbanized in the PRC, with an urbanization rate of 63.4% in \n2010  against  a  national  average  of  47.5%.  However,  robust  economic  growth  and  rapid \nurbanization have been achieved at the cost of considerable environmental degradation. The \nprovince  faces  mounting  challenges  in  terms  of  ecological  protection  standards  and \nenvironmental  safeguards,  which  are  compounded  by  an  accelerating  industrialization  and \nurbanization process unfolding in the northern, western, and eastern areas of the province. \n \n                                                \n1\n  Xinjiang and Gansu, Hunan and Jiangxi, Heilongjiang and Jilin, Chongqing and Guizhou, and Anhui and Hubei, \neach were combined into single TA projects. \n2  ADB, People\u2019s Republic of China Resident Mission. 2011. Effects and Impacts of ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance on \nProvincial Development Strategies. Beijing.  \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 31 August 2011. \n ", "2   \n5.  The environmental challenges in Guangdong have been aggravated by rapid expansion \nof emissions and pollutants, as well as the appearance of new pollution sources. For instance, \npolluted soil has become a new source of pollution in the northern, western, and eastern areas \nof  Guangdong.  Such  pollutants,  including  persistent  organic  pollutants,  radioactive  and \nhazardous waste, electronics waste, and sludge, significantly affect people\u2019s daily lives. In \naddition, rural nonpoint source pollution4 has become a major concern after industrial pollution \nand increased household waste. Moreover, environmental degradation and its harmful impact \non people\u2019s health have increased social tensions in some areas of Guangdong since the \nexisting and potential environmental threats have emerged as public concerns and cannot be \neliminated quickly.  \n \n6.  Another challenge relates to the weakness of environmental monitoring mechanisms. A \nnumber of heavy chemical industries in the province are located in environmentally sensitive \nareas, including densely populated areas and large river basins. Further, most of the operating \nand highly polluting small and medium-sized enterprises are not effectively covered by the \nenvironmental monitoring system due to inadequate monitoring capacity.  \n \n7.  Environmental challenges are particularly pressing in rural areas and small cities,5 due to \nthe lack or weakness of basic environmental infrastructure, including solid waste and sewage \ntreatment facilities, and lack of adequate regulations for environmental protection. While the \ngovernment\u2019s policy reform agenda is progressively prioritizing and addressing environmental \nissues, the response to date is insufficient to tackle the existing and emerging issues deriving \nfrom industrial pollution, waste treatment, and nonpoint source pollution in rural areas and small \ncities. To illustrate the point, at present only five counties and cities out of 67 in the province \nhave established treatment facilities for solid waste, and merely 44 villages out of 22,105 have \nsewage systems.  \n \n8.  As a result, spreading pollution is threatening sustainable socioeconomic development in \nthe province. Potential environmental risks call for a more forceful policy and legal framework \nplus better monitoring mechanisms. The TA will focus on improving the ecological environment \nin Guangdong\u2019s rural areas and small cities. Geographically, it will cover the Pearl River Delta, \nthe northern region of the province, and its eastern and western counties. Thematically, it will \naddress  issues  related  to  improving  energy  efficiency,  reducing  water  and  air  pollution, \ncontrolling agricultural nonpoint source pollution, managing human and farm livestock wastes, \nprotecting rural ecological environments, and improving rural infrastructure.  \n \n9.  The TA directly supports ADB\u2019s country partnership strategy for the PRC (2008\u20132010) \nand the anticipated priorities of the new partnership strategy now under preparation. Under the \nstrategies, ADB seeks, among other objectives, to support government\u2019s efforts to foster a \ncleaner and more sustainable growth process by pilot testing cutting-edge clean energy and \nenergy efficiency technologies; developing low-carbon transport systems, particularly in public \ntransport; encouraging protection and sustainable use of land, water, and forest resources; \ndeveloping  model  livable  and  low-carbon  cities;  and  promoting  the  development  and \ninstitutionalization of green financing instruments. \n  \n                                                \n4\n  Nonpoint source pollution refers to both water and air pollution from diffuse sources. Nonpoint source water \npollution includes such sources as polluted runoff from agricultural areas that drain into a river or wind-borne debris \nblowing  out  to  sea.  Examples  of  nonpoint  source  air  pollution  include  such  sources  as  smokestacks  and \nautomobiles.  \n5\n  Small city refers to towns at or below township administrative level. \n    ", "3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The expected impact of the TA is an improved environment in the rural areas and small \ncities  of  Guangdong.  The  expected  outcome  is  a  strengthened  policy  framework  for \nenvironmental protection and environment safeguards in Guangdong\u2019s rural areas and small \ncities.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  The  TA  will  have  two  main  outputs:  a  comprehensive  report  on  improving  the \nenvironment in rural areas and small cities in Guangdong completed, as well as at least eight \npolicy notes based on the findings and conclusions of the main report prepared. \n \n12.  The comprehensive report will discuss issues related to energy efficiency improvement, \nwater  and  air  pollution  reduction,  agricultural  nonpoint  source  pollution  control,  household \ngarbage  management,  rural  ecological  environment  protection,  and  rural  infrastructure \nimprovement. The report will have at least five chapters covering the following themes: (i) the \ngeneral situation and development trends in the ecological environment in rural areas and small \ncities;  (ii)  common  and  special  environmental  issues  in  the  various  subregions  and  their \nunderlying causes; (iii) international good practices and lessons learned in dealing with such \nchallenges; (iv) policy recommendations to address the environmental issues in rural areas and \nsmall cities, including capacity building, environmental awareness, and environmental protection \nincentives; and (v) project concept papers for potential key interventions to strengthen the \neffectiveness of the policy recommendations.  \n \n13.  The TA will disseminate research findings and policy suggestions through workshops \nand publications. Key activities include three workshops (inception, midterm review, and final \ndraft report review) plus a dissemination conference by June 2013. The final report and policy \nnotes will be published for wide distribution.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The Government has requested ADB to finance $400,000 equivalent.  The TA will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).  \nThe  Guangdong  provincial  government  will  provide  counterpart  support  in  the  form  of \ncounterpart  staff,  office  facilities,  resource  persons,  logistical  support,  and  other  in-kind \ncontributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \n15.  The cost estimate is based on engaging expert inputs totaling 32.5 person-months of \nindividual consulting services,6 including 1.5 person-months for an international consultant and \nfive national consultants for a total of 31 person-months. The international consultant will be a \nrural environment specialist. The national consultants will be (i) a public policy management \nspecialist; (ii) an environment specialist; (iii) an agricultural economist; (iv) a rural development \nspecialist; and (v) an industrial economist. The consultant team will be responsible for producing \nThe views expressed herein are those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \nmembers, Board of Directors, Management, or staff, and may be preliminary in nature.  \n                                                \n6\n  The Guangdong provincial government will hire several consultants through its counterpart financing and plans to \nmobilize them shortly. To ensure all consultants work as a team and produce outputs in a timely manner, the \nexecuting agency has requested ADB to facilitate efficient consultant recruitment by using individual consultants. \n ", "4   \nthe TA outputs and deliverables in a timely and effective manner, as well as for organizing and \ncarrying out all TA activities. The consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in Appendix 3.  \n \n16.  The TA\u2019s support for workshops may include costs related to the venue, equipment \nrental, translation,  printing  and  copying,  transportation,  lodging,  logistics  and  administrative \nsupport, and other expenditures with prior agreement from ADB. In line with standard ADB \nprocedures, the TA will not support implementing agency management fees or related costs \nsuch as staff salaries and allowances or the use of implementing agency resources (such as \noffice accommodation), which will be provided as part of the counterpart contribution.  The \nexecuting and implementing agencies will conduct the workshops and administer the costs. \nADB  will  establish  an  advance  payment  facility  to  facilitate  efficient  disbursements  of  the \nworkshops upon request. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  The TA will be implemented over 20 months, from February 2012 to September 2013. \nThe  Guangdong  Provincial  Finance  Department  will  be  the  executing  agency.  The  Policy \nResearch Office in Guangdong will be the implementing agency. To guide and monitor TA \nimplementation, a steering committee, led by the Policy Research Office in Guangdong, will be \nestablished comprising members from Guangdong Provincial Finance Department, Guangdong \nProvincial  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  Guangdong  Provincial  Environment \nProtection Department, Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Department, Guangdong Provincial \nHousing  and  Construction  Department,  Guangdong  Provincial  Economy  and  Information \nDepartment,  Guangdong  Provincial  Land  Department,  government  think  tanks,  and  other \ngovernment agencies concerned.  \n \n18.  The provincial government will set up a project management office, supported by the \nFiscal Science Research Institute under the Guangdong Provincial Finance Department, to \nadminister the TA project and provide logistical support to the consultants. The counterpart staff \nof Guangdong will assist the consultants in carrying out their assignments by providing basic \nstatistical  data,  updating  policy  information,  arranging  consultation  meetings  with  local \ngovernment officials, and providing local transportation and office facilities.  \n \n19.  The executing agency will provide a suitably furnished office with computers, utilities, and \ntelecommunications access (including broadband internet connection), materials, maps, data, \nand documents as required under the TA, and it will cover the cost of office utilities for the \nconsultants. The executing agency will also cover remuneration and per diem for counterpart \nstaff, designate a TA focal point with strong English speaking and writing skills, and facilitate all \nTA activities to ensure effective implementation of the TA. \n \n20.  In consultation with the executing agency, ADB will recruit national and international \nexperts to provide inputs as formal consultants, short-term resource persons, and task-specific \nexperts.  The  international  and  national  consultants  (including  resource  persons  and  task-\nspecific experts) will be selected and engaged on an individual basis by ADB in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time).
