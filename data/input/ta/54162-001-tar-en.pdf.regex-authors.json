INTRODUCTION \n1.  Strategy 2030 focuses on seven operational priorities necessary to achieve the Asian \nDevelopment Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) vision of a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and \nthe  Pacific.1 Operational  Priority  6  (OP6)  concentrates  on  strengthening  governance  and \ninstitutional capacity, and the related operational plan commits to strengthening country systems \nand standards as a strategic priority.2 In alignment with this operational plan, this knowledge and \nsupport  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  help  strengthen  the  fiduciary  systems3 of  selected \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) by (i) developing a methodology for conducting integrated \nfiduciary risk assessments (IFRAs)4 at the country, sector, and agency levels that can contribute \nto ADB\u2019s country partnership strategies (CPSs); (ii) testing the methodology in selected DMC CPS \nprocesses  and  financing  DMC  and/or  donor-led  fiduciary  assessments;  and (iii)  supporting \nspecific strengthening activities in response to identified weaknesses.  \n2.  This TA is included in the Technical Assistance Special Fund corporate priority list for \n2020.  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Global declarations on aid effectiveness (e.g., Paris, Accra, Busan, and Mexico) and other \nrelated literature make a strong case for the use of country systems by development finance \nproviders.5 ADB has endorsed these international declarations and is committed to their agenda. \nThe main argument for using country systems is to shift the focus of ADB, other development \npartners, and DMC governments toward strengthening countries\u2019 own systems and institutional \ncapacity (as opposed to using parallel systems), and thus improve the impact and sustainability \nof development initiatives.  \n4.  Strategy 2030 recognizes that robust governance and institutional capacity foster public \nand private sector confidence, providing an environment conducive to increased economic \ninvestment and growth. By prioritizing DMCs\u2019 governance and institutional capacity through OP6, \nADB is aligning its aspirations for Asia and the Pacific with the global commitments in the 2030 \nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs).6 SDG 16 acknowledges the unfinished governance \nagenda worldwide and calls on countries to build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions \nat all levels, promote the rule of law, enhance government transparency, and reduce corruption.  \n \n1 ADB. 2018.

The delivery of efficient and effective services by state institutions to its citizens requires \nrobust country fiduciary systems.7 Ensuring that ADB projects utilize such country systems \neffectively is one of the three strategic pillars of the OP6 operational plan, which notes the need \nto help DMCs identify issues constraining their country systems and commits ADB to accelerate \nits  support  to  strengthen  them.  Helping  to  improve  governance  standards  increases  the \nsustainability  of  ADB-financed  activities,  while  also  having  a  multiplier  effect  of  improving \ntransparency and accountability in the use of public funds, including those of other development \npartners. \n6.  ADB\u2019s commitment to strengthen country systems reinforces its earlier initiatives. In 2006, \nADB developed the Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II), a diagnostic \ntool for carrying out governance risk assessments (GRAs) in financial management, procurement, \nand anticorruption. The GACAP II informs, through risk assessment and management plans \n(RAMPs), the governance risk section of ADB\u2019s CPSs, sector strategies, and project designs; \nprovides guidance on the use of country systems; and identifies areas for strengthening.8  \n7.  To complement the GACAP II and increase focus on fiduciary risks, ADB in 2014 and \n2015 enhanced its level of fiduciary due diligence by developing country and sector/agency \nprocurement  risk  assessments  (CSPRAs)  and  updating  project-level  financial  management \nassessments guidance. The CSPRA predominantly covers country and sector/agency risks \nwhereas  the  financial  management  assessment  focuses  on  project-level  risks.  A  more \ncomprehensive methodology to inform financial management risk and mitigating measures at the \ncountry and sector levels is still needed. \n8.  In 2019, ADB evaluated past CPSs and related RAMPs completed in the last 10 years, \nand identified limitations and areas for change.9 For example, while GRAs were performed for \neach of the eight CPSs approved in 2019, options for strengthening and using DMC systems for \nfinancial management and procurement were not effectively pursued.10 In addition, different \napproaches used for procurement and financial management RAMPs in CPSs and projects made \nit challenging to obtain an integrated view of country fiduciary systems.  \n9.  Across ADB\u2019s DMCs, completed CSPRAs have highlighted weaknesses in governments\u2019 \nsystems and processes, including existing legislation which, in some cases, does not follow best \ninternational practices. Past ADB GRAs have also underlined limitations in country and sector \npublic financial management systems. These issues are often compounded by capacity deficits \nat the implementation level and together they undermine the performance of country systems and \nADB\u2019s ability to permit their use on projects. \n10.  The Procurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department (PPFD) also noted in \nits operational reviews that DMCs\u2019 weak institutions and governance and the inadequate capacity \nof executing and implementing agency staff affect project financial sustainability and impact \n \n7 For this purpose, \u201cinstitutions\u201d mean the organizations that implement and/or oversee the implementation of public \nprojects and programs. They extend from the central government agencies responsible for budget planning, \nexecution, and reporting (e.g., finance, planning, and sector ministries) to the institutions responsible for budget \nmonitoring and oversight (e.g., supreme audit agencies), and include both national and subnational institutions, \nsectoral and program-level institutions, and public sector and quasi-private sector institutions, such as state-owned \nenterprises. For the purposes of this paper, \u201cfiduciary\u201d refers to procurement and financial management systems. \n8 ADB. 2006. Second Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan (GACAP II).

Recognizing DMC capacity issues and limitations, regional departments within ADB have \nbeen processing TA projects with a focus on strengthening the capacity of executing and \nimplementing agencies.14 These TA projects focus on the agencies\u2019 capacity and arrangements \nto procure, account, report, and audit project funds; and would benefit from a streamlined \napproach to assessing country, sector, and agency fiduciary systems. \n12.  Given these observations and in line with the targets in OP6, ADB should further augment \nits approach to conducting assessments and helping strengthen country systems. An improved \napproach  that  combines  financial  management  and  procurement  assessments  will  enable \ndiagnostic and subsequent strengthening activities to be delivered in a more integrated, efficient, \nand holistic manner. This will also enable ADB to better support DMCs in strengthening their \nfiduciary systems and institutional capacity. \n13.  The  TA  will  help  strengthen  DMCs\u2019  fiduciary  systems  and  capacity,  increasing  the \npossibility that ADB and other development partners will be able to utilize country systems in their \noperations. Strengthened country systems will increase the probability of successful outcomes \nfor  ADB-financed  projects  and  programs  and,  more  generally,  improve  relevant  DMCs\u2019 \nperformance in public procurement and financial management. The results of both the ADB IFRA \nand  complementary  country-led  fiduciary  assessments  will  inform  this  support. 15  These \nassessments will establish a baseline from which subsequent activities for strengthening country \nfiduciary systems may be agreed and developed. \n14.  This TA aims to strengthen DMCs\u2019 capacity and knowledge in procurement and financial \nmanagement, including by supporting (i) executing and implementing agencies responsible for \nthe delivery of ADB-financed projects; (ii) procurement institutions with a mandate to develop and \ndisseminate normative guidance, oversee procurement, and undertake capacity building activities; \n(iii) comptroller generals responsible for government financial accounts and public internal control \nsystems; and (iv) supreme audit institutions responsible for providing assurance on the efficient \n \n11 ADB (Procurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department). 2020.

Where available, development partner led assessments will serve as the baseline from which an \nIFRA will be prepared, and the focus will be on the sector and agency levels, reflecting the specific emphasis on CPS \nactivities in a DMC and identifying, in a more targeted manner, risks that could negatively impact the implementation \nof ADB projects during the CPS term. The IFRA outputs will complement the findings of country-led assessments \nand inform the dialogue between the government and development partners on strengthening activities. \n ", "4 \nuse of public funds. Where applicable, this TA will promote knowledge sharing and capacity \nbuilding through local and regional professional organizations to create a strong and reliable \naccounting and audit profession in Asia and the Pacific. \n15.  Besides the IFRAs, which will follow ADB\u2019s CPS processing schedule, other interventions \nwill be demand driven at the request of the DMCs with the endorsement of ADB regional \ndepartments.  ADB  will  engage  with  other  development  partners  and  regional  bodies  and \ncomplement ongoing initiatives in both procurement and financial management. The TA will \nprioritize support to low-income countries; countries in fragile, conflict-affected situations; and \nsmall island developing states. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n16.   The  TA  is  aligned  with  the  following  impact:  governance  and  institutional  enabling \nenvironment  for  sustainable  growth  improved.16 The  TA  will  have  the  following  outcome: \nperformance of fiduciary systems and institutions in selected DMCs strengthened.17 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n17.  The TA will have three outputs:  \nOutput 1. Fiduciary assessments conducted in selected developing member countries. A \ncountry and sector/agency financial management assessment will be developed and merged with \nthe existing CSPRA to create a single IFRA covering both financial management and procurement. \nFollowing testing of the IFRA in two selected DMCs, its use will be mainstreamed to allow the \ncompletion of comprehensive fiduciary risk assessments at the country and sector/agency level \nprior to CPS preparation, ensuring that the IFRA results flow through to project design and \nimplementation.18 The IFRA will be accompanied by a suite of guidance materials and embedded \nin ADB staff instructions to ensure that a consistent and comprehensive approach is undertaken. \nOutput 2. Country-led fiduciary assessments and developing member country systems\u2019 \nstrengthening initiatives supported. ADB will finance country-led fiduciary assessments and \nenhance its engagement with development partners to better contribute to the development of \ncountry-level  fiduciary  systems.  ADB  will  also  support  the  implementation  of strengthening \nmeasures to address weaknesses identified during fiduciary assessments. This may include the \nengagement of technical experts to help the government develop and implement a strengthening \naction plan, or more targeted interventions, such as technical support for policy development.  \nOutput 3. Developing member country institutional capacity on financial management and \nprocurement strengthened. In its role as a knowledge provider, ADB will work with governments \nto strengthen the capacity of the procurement and financial management function through the \ndissemination of knowledge products and delivery of workshops, seminars, and targeted training. \n \n16 ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n17 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n18 In advance of the finalization of the IFRA, the TA will support CPS processing activities in DMCs through the \nidentification and mitigation of fiduciary risks using existing assessment modalities. \n ", "5 \n18.  The TA approach is adopted due to the broad coverage of the activities across all DMCs, \nthe technical nature of the outputs and related activities proposed, and the ability to transfer \nlessons learned on suitable strengthening activities across multiple DMCs. These activities can \nbe more efficiently delivered through ADB directly managing consultants. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6: $1,000,000 and TASF-other sources: $1,000,000). \nKey expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  ADB will administer the TA. The PPFD will select, supervise, and evaluate consultants; \norganize workshops; and provide staff to act as resource persons in the workshops. \n21.  Noting the potential impact of travel restrictions on access to DMCs due to the coronavirus \ndisease pandemic, the TA period has been extended by 1 additional year to 2024. The terms of \nreference for consultants additionally require the development of contingency plans to mitigate \nthe risks posed by coronavirus disease restrictions on the delivery of contract outputs. The PPFD \nwill work closely with ADB regional departments to adapt implementation arrangements to \nindividual  country  situations,  including  an  enhanced  role  for  resident  mission  staff  in  TA \nimplementation, prioritization of activities that can be more effectively delivered remotely or \nthrough available in-country expertise, and leveraging of activities being undertaken by other \ndonor partners within the scope of this TA. \n22.
