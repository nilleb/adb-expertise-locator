This  includes  evaluation  of  the \nperformance of completed projects, programs, and technical assistance (TA). It also includes   \n(i) reviewing and selectively validating the self-evaluation activities of operational departments; \n(ii) providing feedback for the design and evaluability of new operations; (iii) evaluating the \neffectiveness of ADB\u2019s policies, practices, and procedures; (iv) monitoring and reporting on \nactions  taken  by  ADB  and  its  executing  agencies  in  response  to  OED  evaluation  report \nrecommendations; (v) building evaluation capacity within developing member countries (DMCs), \n(vi) and coordinating evaluation practices and activities with other multilateral development \nbanks through the Evaluation Cooperation Group (ECG), and with other multilateral and bilateral \nassistance agencies. To enhance its contribution to ADB\u2019s development effectiveness, OED \ncarries out a series of thematic evaluation studies in the form of impact, special, and country \nassistance program evaluations. \n2.  The primary aims of all ADB\u2019s evaluation activities are to provide lessons for future \noperations, accountability for use of resources, and follow-up recommendations for sustaining \nthe  benefits  of  activities  supported  by  ADB.  Completed  projects,  programs,  and  TAs  are \nselected independently by OED for purpose of performance audits, which allow an assessment \nof how well resources have been used and provide lessons for incorporation in new operations. \nHarmonization  of  evaluation  activities  through  the  ECG  up  to  now  has  focused  on  good \npractices  for  the  evaluation  of  individual  operations.  The  current  agenda  of  the  ECG \nemphasizes higher level evaluations, involving evaluation of several operations within a sector, \nor a country, or for a particular topic or policy. Such thematic evaluation studies are multi-activity \nand often multicountry in scope. The topics for thematic evaluation studies are selected in \ncoordination with operational and other departments. \n3.  The  program  of  evaluation  reports  and  publications  identified  for  2003  has  been \nreviewed by the Development Effectiveness Committee of the Board of Directors. It includes 17 \nproject and 9 program performance audits, and 9 TA performance audits (Appendix 1). It \nincludes several other outputs of a recurring nature such as an annual review of evaluation \nactivities, and an annual evaluation of portfolio performance. It also includes eight thematic \nevaluation studies. Consulting and other services and materials necessary for carrying out the \nthematic evaluation studies are resourced through regional technical assistance (RETA) funding \nunder ADB\u2019s knowledge products and services program. A RETA framework relating to the \nthematic evaluation studies for 2003 is in Appendix 2.1 \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Impact  evaluation  studies  seek  to  assess  the  results  of  a  group  of  activities  in  a \nparticular sector, or to compare the results of similar activities in different DMCs. The emphasis \nis on the broader institutional and development impacts of ADB-assisted activities. Recent \nstudies of this type have included evaluations of the impact of rural roads on poverty reduction, \nthe impact of ADB\u2019s investment funds operations, and the impact of selected water supply and \nsanitation projects. One impact evaluation study is included in the 2003 work program. \n5.  Special  evaluation  studies  are  undertaken  in  relation  to  a  wide  range  of  topics. \nFrequently they relate to the policies or strategic concerns of ADB. Recent special evaluation \n                                                 \n1  The RETA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities in November 2002. ", " \n2  \n \nstudies have included a study of the poverty reduction effect of selected agriculture and social \ninfrastructure projects, a study of the public and private provision of primary education in \nselected countries, and a study of Asian Development Fund VI and VII operations. Six special \nevaluation studies are included in the 2003 work program. \n6.  Country assistance program evaluations (CAPEs) assess the full range of ADB activities \nwithin a particular DMC over a substantial period of a decade or more. They seek to address \nissues, and make recommendations, relating to the focus of ADB activities, including the sector \nmix and use of assistance modalities. They therefore contribute to assessing current, and \nformulating new, country strategies and programs. Given the greater country focus of future \nADB operations, country level evaluations will play a larger role in evaluation activities. CAPEs \nhave been completed recently for Bangladesh, Mongolia, and Philippines. One new CAPE is \nincluded in the 2003 work program. \n7.  Thematic evaluation studies generally require a longer time and a larger budget than \nevaluations of individual operations. It is expected that three or four of these thematic evaluation \nstudies will be completed in 2004 rather than 2003. In terms of OED staff time, thematic \nevaluation studies account for more than 20% of the total. From operational departments, and \nfrom other departments and the Development Effectiveness Committee of the Board, there is a \ndemand for these broader studies of the development effectiveness of ADB operations to \nprovide lessons for all the DMCs in the region and for ADB.  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n8.  The purpose of this RETA is to assess the effectiveness of ADB operations and policies \nthrough eight thematic evaluation studies designed to (i) assess their relevance, efficacy, \nsustainability, impacts, and, where appropriate, efficiency; and (ii) provide timely feedback on \noperational and policy issues to the DMCs and ADB. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The scope of each thematic evaluation study is as follows. \n10.  Impact Evaluation Study of Asian Development Bank Assistance in the Power \nSector in Bangladesh.  Bangladesh has the third lowest level of energy consumption per \ncapita in Asia. Only about 30% of the country\u2019s 130 million people have access to electricity; low \ncoverage has been a key constraint to economic development and poverty reduction. Since the \ncountry\u2019s  independence  in  1971,  ADB  has  provided  extensive  support  for  power  sector \ndevelopment through power generation, transmission, and distribution projects, including 16 in \nthe public sector and 1 in the private sector, plus 18 TA grants. In the 1990s, ADB was the lead \nfunding agency, accounting for about one third of all financial assistance from development \nagencies in the sector. ADB has adopted a strategy of continued physical investment in system \nrehabilitation and expansion combined with a focus on reform, including greater private sector \nparticipation, and cost recovery by key public utilities. Despite some progress, the power sector \nin Bangladesh still suffers from severe undercapacity and poor financial performance.  \n11.  The  objectives  of  the  proposed  study  are  to  (i)  provide  a  comprehensive  and \nindependent assessment of the impact of ADB\u2019s assistance on the sector\u2019s development and \nfinancial performance, as well as its wider impacts on economic development and poverty \n   ", "  \n    3\n \nreduction; (ii) identify the key factors behind the undercapacity and poor financial performance; \nand (iii) identify critical areas for improvement of ADB\u2019s assistance and the power sector as a \nwhole. Recommendations are anticipated on the direction and specific modalities of ADB\u2019s \ncontinued assistance in the power sector. \n12.  Special  Evaluation  Study  of  Participatory  Forest  and  Water  Resources \nManagement.  Experience  from  ADB-financed  projects  points  to  the  need  for  greater \ninvolvement of stakeholders in all stages of the project cycle. There is a growing emphasis on \nthe  involvement  of  individual  and  community  beneficiaries  as  well  as  nongovernment \norganizations.  ADB  has  provided  substantial  assistance  for  participatory  forest  and  water \nresource  management  projects  with  an  increasing  focus  on  participatory  project \nformulation/implementation  and  household/community-based  resource  management. \nExperience in water resources management indicates that a firm institutional basis should be \ndeveloped, with the inclusion of a majority of the intended beneficiaries, from whom financial \ncontributions  are  sometimes  expected,  prior  to  initiating  project  implementation.  However, \ninsufficient information is available about the impact of this participatory approach, specifically in \nterms of conservation, efficiency, equity in benefit sharing, poverty reduction, and sustainability.  \n 13.  This study will undertake a cross-country assessment of ADB-financed participatory \nforest  and  water  resource  management  projects  involving  four  DMCs:  Bangladesh,  Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam. The study will (i) review \nADB\u2019s portfolio related to water and forest resources management, with particular emphasis on \nparticipatory  resource  management  operations;  (ii)  assess  relevant  policy  and  institutional \nconditions, including the capacity and performance of concerned organizations as well as the \nlegal framework; (iii) assess the impact of the participatory approach to planning and managing \nnatural resources; (iv) assess the effectiveness of procedures and arrangements, including \nmanagement information systems and external audit, contributing to the level of achievement of \noutput and outcome indicators; and (v) identify key factors responsible for the success or failure \nof such projects. \n14.  Special  Evaluation  Study  of  Rural  Development  Projects  in  Poor  Regions. \nIntegrated rural development (IRD) projects have been widely used by ADB to address the dual \nobjectives of poverty reduction and balanced regional development. An IRD project typically \nincludes multiple components covering rural infrastructure, agricultural production, and social \nservices. Evaluation of a set of early IRD projects found that a top-down and supply-driven \napproach in the design of these projects resulted in less relevant project interventions, lack of \nbeneficiary ownership, inefficiency, poor sustainability, and insignificant impact on rural poverty. \nSince the mid-1990s, a community-based approach with strong ownership of local communities \nand their active participation in subproject design and implementation has been used in a new \ngeneration of IRD projects, with some encouraging initial results. \n \n15.  The study will examine a set of recently completed and approved IRD projects that have \nused  the  community-based  approach  in  a  number  of  DMCs  that  may  include  Indonesia, \nPakistan,  and  Philippines.  It  will  summarize  their  positive  experience,  analyze  problems \nencountered,  investigate  underlying  factors,  and  develop  recommendations  for  future \nimprovement. The major scope of the study will include (i) a comparison of the old and new IRD \nprojects in terms of design, implementation, beneficiary ownership, and performance; (ii)  an \ninvestigation  of  the  conditions  required  for  success;  and  (iii)  recommendations  for \nimprovements. \n \n ", " \n4  \n \n16.  Special Evaluation Study of Small and Medium Enterprise Activities. Almost 90% of \nthe jobs created in ADB\u2019s DMCs are in small businesses. ADB has provided support to  small \nand medium enterprises (SMEs) through both public and private sector operations. Frequently, \nthis has involved lines of credit through government-owned development finance institutions \n(DFIs), often at subsidized interest rates. Many earlier DFI loans failed due to a poor regulatory \nand business environment. More recently, the emphasis has been to help improve the overall \ninvestment climate and the provision of assistance to SME support networks, clusters, linkages, \nand business development services. The instruments used have included DFI loans, program \nloans, TA, and investments directly in companies and venture capital funds. Support has been \nundertaken by a variety of operational departments, including those responsible for ADB\u2019s \nactivities in industry, finance, education, agriculture, and the private sector. \n17.  There  appears  to  be  no  ADB-wide  SME  policy  or  even  a  central  depository  of \nexperiences, lessons identified, and standard operating policies and procedures; it is difficult to \ngauge the extent of ADB\u2019s SME activities and key success factors. The study will review ADB\u2019s \ninvolvement in the SME sector. The scope will include an examination of a selection of SME \nprojects in three or four DMCs, which may include Sri Lanka, Thailand, Uzbekistan, and Viet \nNam, to determine the success or failure of the projects, identify key lessons, and make \nrecommendations for future operations in the sector. In its formulation and conclusions, the \nstudy  will  draw  on  the  experience  of  other  assistance  agencies,  and  on  cooperation \nmechanisms at the country level. The study will feed into the development of a framework for \nSME support.  \n18.  Special Evaluation Study of Capacity\u2013Building Technical Assistance in the Lao \nPeople\u2019s Democratic Republic. ADB has provided advisory TA to Lao PDR over the past 30 \nyears totaling more than $60 million in grant funds. Many of the TAs were designed to build the  \ncapacities of local institutions. Such continuing cooperation with some of the line ministries and \ncentral  agencies  should  have  resulted  in  an  improvement  in  public  resource  and  sector \nmanagement. However, a common perception is that there is a need to continue assistance for \ncapacity building. It is necessary to take stock of experience so far, to assess the approaches \nthat have been taken, and to identify changes that could be introduced. \n19.  The objective of the evaluation is to assess how effective ADB assistance has been in \nbuilding the capacities of central ministries and agencies for public resource management, and   \nline  agencies  at  the  central  and  provincial  levels  for  sector  management  and  for  project \nimplementation. The evaluation scope will include a review of (i) ownership and commitment to \ninstitutional  change;  (ii)  approaches  and  modalities  used  for  identifying,  designing,  and \nimplementing  capacity  building;  (iii)  effects  of  ADB-funded  operations  on  institutional \nperformance, using key performance indicators; and (iv) impact of institutional change on public \nresource management practices and on sector performance, including service delivery. The \nfindings of the evaluation are expected to be useful in planning the future TA program for Lao \nPDR and to provide an input into country strategy and program updates. \n20.  Special Evaluation Study of Project Cost Estimates.  Accurate and reliable project \ncost estimates are a key ingredient of effective development assistance. The large number of \nprojects  that  have  experienced  either  significant  cost  underruns  or  overruns  has  been  a \npersistent issue in ADB operations. Of all projects with project completion reports circulated \nfrom 1965 through 2002, about 58% (484 projects) reported an average cost underrun of 26% \nof total project cost, while 39% (325 projects) reported an average cost overrun of 40%.2 More \nrecently  (1998-2002),  72%  of  all  projects  had  cost  underruns  and  25%  experienced  cost \n                                                 \n2 Figures exclude DFI projects and program loans, which will both be excluded from the special evaluation study.  \n   ", "  \n    5\n \noverruns. A trend towards cost underruns has thus emerged, while cost overrun problems have \nattenuated but remain substantive. For the DMCs, loan savings could have financed additional \nprojects and avoided financial charges; cost overruns result in uneconomic or lower than \nprojected returns. For ADB, both underruns and overruns indicate an inefficient allocation of \nresources and reduced development impact. \n \n21.  The reasons for the variations in project costs may include cost estimation procedures of \nthe  DMCs,  and  project  preparation  and  lending  procedures  of  ADB,  apart  from  inherent \nuncertainty. The major objectives of the study are to (i) determine the major causes of project \ncost underruns and overruns in ADB-assisted projects in the context of their implementation \nschedules; (ii) quantify the contribution of each major factor to nonrobust cost estimation at \nproject  appraisal;  (iii)  quantify  the  resulting  financial  impact  on  DMCs;  and  (iv)  make \nrecommendations on required changes in guidelines, systems, and procedures to improve cost \nestimation reliability, and to share the risk of unpredictable changes in  project costs. The study \nwill use primary data from project feasibility and detailed design studies, and secondary data \nfrom ADB and government sources in selected DMCs, which may include India, Indonesia, \nPakistan, and Viet Nam. A survey of relevant DMC officials and ADB staff will also be carried \nout. \n \n22.  Special  Evaluation  Study  of  the  Role  of  Project  Implementation  Units. \nAdministration  of  projects  funded  by  ADB  has  typically  been  conducted  by  project \nimplementation units (PIUs) created specifically for each project.  Although PIUs are intended to \nenhance administrative capacity and promote technology transfer, some evidence indicates that \ntheir use can undermine the long-term capacity-building process of government and executing \nagencies (EAs). This may be because the PIU typically dissolves once project implementation is \ncomplete, with much of the experience gained during the project lost, or because it reflects an \nexternally  driven,  project-based  approach,  and  does  not  adhere  to  organizational  lines  of \nauthority.  An  alternative method of project administration, in which the government agency \nconcerned  utilizes  its  existing  mainstream  operations  and  personnel  resources  for \nimplementation, may increase opportunities for institutional learning and capacity building as \nwell as promote greater project responsibility.  \n \n23.   The proposed study will (i) assess the positive and negative features of the PIU system; \n(ii) compare the use of PIUs with the positive and negative features of project administration by \nthe  permanent  administrative  structure  of  EAs;  (iii)  separately  assess  the  situation  for \nmultisector projects involving several EAs or implementing agencies; (iv) determine if there are \ndifferences  between  administration  by  a  central  public  sector  agency  and  other  entities, \nincluding  local  governments;  and  (v)  consider  special  situations  such  as  post-conflict \nreconstruction. The methodology will include quantitative assessments through surveys, and \ncase studies, in about four DMCs. Case study projects will include active and completed \nprojects.  \n \n24.  Country  Assistance  Program  Evaluation  for  Cambodia.  ADB  has  been  a  major \nsupporter of Cambodia\u2019s rehabilitation efforts since its operations resumed there in 1992. It has \napproved 23 projects with a total loan amount of $640 million. The assistance program has also \nincluded advisory TA; RETA; economic, sector, and thematic work; and policy dialogue. A key \naspect of the assistance program has been the resources devoted to capacity building in the \ncontext of a shortage of skills and a reliance on external resources. \n ", " \n6  \n \n25.  The overall objective of the CAPE is to assess the development effectiveness of ADB \nassistance to Cambodia since 1992. The evaluation will (i) review Cambodia\u2019s macroeconomic \ndevelopment plans and goals; (ii) assess the country strategy and assistance program in terms \nof relevance and responsiveness to the country\u2019s needs; (iii) assess the forms of coordination \nwith other development partners; and (iv) assess the country assistance program in terms of \ncomposition, effectiveness, sustainability, and impacts. Lessons identified will be used to assist \nin the design of ADB\u2019s future country strategy and program, and in improving coordination \namong development partners.  \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n26.  The RETA is estimated to cost $1.4 million (Appendix 3). It will be financed by ADB on a \ngrant basis from the ADB-funded TA program.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n27.  OED will implement the RETA. An evaluation report will be prepared for each of the \neight  thematic  evaluation  studies.  The  studies  will  be  carried  out  by  OED  staff  with  the \nassistance of international and domestic consultants. Altogether, about 37 person-months of \ninternational  consulting  and  about  53  person-months of domestic consulting inputs will be \nrequired. The individual areas of expertise, duration of engagement of consultants, and outline \nterms of reference are given in Appendix 4. In keeping with OED\u2019s practice, a position paper for \neach  study  outlining  the  detailed  approach,  methodology,  and  terms  of  reference  will  be \nprepared prior to engaging consultants and commencement of the studies. Consultants will be \nengaged according to ADB\u2019s  Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB on the engagement of domestic consultants. Operational departments and \nDMC governments will be consulted at all stages of formulation and implementation, and \ninvolved in the discussion of results. The RETA will commence in February 2003 and will be \ncompleted by the end of 2004. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n28.
