The 11th meeting of the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) Working Group on Human \nResource Development (WGHRD), held in Yangon, Myanmar in November 2012, discussed the \ndraft GMS Human Resource Development (HRD) Strategic Framework and Action Plan (SFAP), \n2013\u20132017. At the meeting the Asian Development Bank (ADB) was also requested to provide \nregional  technical  assistance  (TA)  to  support  the  implementation  of  the  action  plan\u2019s  key \nactivities.  The  SFAP,  2013\u20132017  was  endorsed  by  the  GMS  ministers  at  the  18th  GMS \nMinisterial Conference in December 2012.1 The TA will contribute to achieving the objectives of \nADB\u2019s  Regional  Cooperation  and  Integration  Strategy 2  as  well  as  the  GMS  Strategic \nFramework,  2012\u20132022. 3 The  TA  will  take  into  account  emerging  regional  issues  and \nmultisector links, priorities, and initiatives in the HRD sector that support and reinforce the focus \non the economic corridor development approach in the GMS. The TA will focus on three of the \nseven  strategic  thrusts  of  the  SFAP,  2013\u20132017  (para.  7).  The  design  and  monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.4   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Economic growth in the GMS has been rapid, averaging 6% per annum in recent years, \ndespite economic shocks in 2008. However, growth has been unbalanced within the subregion \nand may possibly slowdown in the future. There are also substantial differences in the levels of \nincome  among  the  GMS  countries  and  in  the  degrees  of  social  sector  development. \nCooperation  in  HRD  can  contribute  to  broad  economic  growth  and  sustainable  social \ndevelopment within the GMS. It can also address problems and needs arising from increased \nregional  connectivity  and  integration  in  other  sectors,  and  facilitate  the  process  of  further \nintegration by harmonizing HRD policies, procedures, and regulations in critical areas. The TA \nwill address selected priority HRD issues and challenges identified in the SFAP, 2013\u20132017,5 \nwhich include (i) the absence of harmonized frameworks in GMS countries for promoting the \nfree  flow  of  skilled  labor  and  student  mobility  across  borders,  and  (ii)  a  further  need  to \nstrengthen an HRD cooperation mechanism in the GMS. Cross-border skilled labor will help fill \nskill gaps, and has the potential to yield substantial economic benefits to GMS countries while \npromoting poverty reduction by providing income-earning opportunities to the poor.   \n \n3.  GMS cooperation and integration in many sectors creates a need for increased human \nresource capacity in many areas. This need is echoed in the Association of Southeast Asian \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2013. Strategic Framework and Action Plan for Human Resource Development in the Greater Mekong \nSubregion, 2013\u20132017. Manila. The six GMS countries are Cambodia, the People\u2019s Republic of China (Yunnan \nProvince and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region), the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, \nThailand, and Viet Nam.  \n2   ADB. 2006. Regional Cooperation and Integration Strategy. Manila.  \n3  ADB. 2011. The Greater Mekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework, 2012\u20132022. \n \nManila.  \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 14 November 2013.  \n5   ADB addresses cross-border and regional health issues such as communicable disease control under the ongoing \nGMS Communicable Disease Control Project (Phase 2). In collaboration with the GMS Working Group on \nAgriculture, the World Health Organization tackled the issue of cross-border trade in contaminated food and fake \nand/or substandard drugs. Concerns regarding the social impact of rapid growth and subregional integration in the \nGMS economic corridors are being addressed by ADB and development partners. HIV prevention components are \nincluded in ADB infrastructure projects and TA. Other development partners\u2014such as the United Nations Inter-\nAgency Project on Human Trafficking in the GMS, the International Organization for Migration, the United Nations \nChildren\u2019s Fund, and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime\u2014address concerns related to the prevention of \nhuman trafficking, particularly cross-border trafficking of women and children, due to increased labor migration \nacross borders in the GMS. \n ", "2   \nNations (ASEAN) Economic Community blueprint, which calls for the free flow of skilled labor \nacross borders. 6 However, a significant barrier to cross-border labor mobility is the absence of \nharmonized frameworks in GMS countries for technical and vocational education and training \n(TVET) and higher education. Subregional harmonization can facilitate the cross-border flow of \nworkers and students. While making use of opportunities for HRD cooperation in the subregion, \nGMS HRD harmonization activities should build on ASEAN agreements such as the ASEAN \nmutual recognition arrangement framework. Under TA for Implementing the GMS HRD Strategic \nFramework  and  Action  Plan  (Phase  1),7 a  framework  of  mutual  recognition  of  skills  and \nqualifications  in three  skill  areas (welding,  automotive  technology,  and  housekeeping)  was \ntested and validated in some TVET institutions in the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR), Thailand, and Viet Nam. However, there is a need to further develop such a framework, \nto be agreed upon by the six GMS countries.   \n \n4.  Increasing student mobility among reputable universities in the GMS would facilitate the \nfree flow of skilled labor. Harmonization of higher education in the GMS in the area of internal \nuniversity quality assurance and the development of a common credit transfer system (CTS) \nhas been initiated in collaboration with the ASEAN University Network (AUN) and the Southeast \nAsian  Ministers  of  Education  Organization\u2013Regional  Center  for  Higher  Education  and \nDevelopment (SEAMEO\u2013RIHED) under Phase 1. The internal quality assurance capacity of \nuniversities  needs to  be further  strengthened by  providing  training  to  university  personnel, \nincluding management and administration staff and faculty members who will be trainers of \nuniversity  quality  assurance  personnel  in  Cambodia,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  Myanmar.  The \nuniversity quality assurance system will use the AUN Quality Assurance system as a regional \nplatform. While existing systems and schemes of credit transfer were surveyed under Phase 1, \na common CTS needs to be developed, piloted, and assessed. Promoting the networking of \nGMS universities, with facilitation by SEAMEO\u2013RIHED, can help achieve this.   \n \n5.  A key lesson from the implementation of the SFAP, 2009\u20132012 and Phase 1 is that \nmore effective monitoring and implementation is needed at the country level to ensure the \nsuccessful  implementation  of  the  SFAP,  2013\u20132017. 8  Phase  1  has  helped  strengthen \ncooperation and coordination of GMS HRD initiatives by supporting the WGHRD and subsector \nworking group meetings. At this point, national HRD working groups need to be established, \ncoordinated by finance or planning ministries and agencies of GMS countries. Developing, \nimplementing, and monitoring national HRD action plans will also help advance GMS HRD \ninitiatives  at  the  country  level.  Another  important  lesson  is  that  the  involvement  of  key \ndevelopment partners in GMS HRD initiatives needs to be strengthened and deepened in order \nto make significant impact at the regional policy level. For example, GMS higher education \nharmonization and networking requires closer collaboration with the AUN and SEAMEO\u2013RIHED.  \n                                                \n6   ASEAN. 2008. ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint. Jakarta: ASEAN Secretariat.  \n7   ADB. 2009. Technical Assistance for Implementing the GMS HRD Strategic Framework and Action Plan (Phase \n1). Manila (TA 7275-REG, $1.25 million, approved on 29 April).  \n \n8 The SFAP, 2009\u20132012 was supported by Phase 1. The TA has four outputs: (i) strengthened subregional \ninstitutional arrangements for HRD cooperation; (ii) an agreed framework for mutual recognition of skills and \nqualifications; (iii) improved labor market information system and labor migration management programs; and (iv) \ncompleted social impact assessments along GMS economic corridors. Under (i), the TA supported the four \nWGHRD meetings, and subsector working group meetings. Under (ii), a framework for mutual recognition of three \nskills and qualifications in the GMS was piloted. Under (iii), the labor migration awareness campaign for migrant \nworkers and communities in Cambodia and the Lao PDR was conducted by the International Organization for \nMigration. Under (iv), the TA conducted an HRD assessment in Myanmar and filled information and data gaps on \nHIV and migrant workers in the GMS. Achievements and lessons from Phase 1 are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n ", "  3 \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The impact of the TA will be the increased flow of skilled labor in the GMS. The TA \noutcome will be strengthened HRD cooperation in the GMS.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  Building on the gains of past initiatives and recognizing the lessons learned, the TA will \nintensify support to the GMS HRD program while working more closely with GMS countries and \ndevelopment partners. The TA outputs will address three strategic thrusts of the SFAP, 2013\u2013\n2017: (i) improved cooperation in TVET, (ii) improved cooperation in higher education, and (iii) \nstrengthened national implementation and monitoring of the SFAP. A major assumption is \nstrong commitment by GMS governments to achieve subregional cooperation in HRD, while a \nmajor risk is negative economic, political, and social impacts of economic slowdown.  \n \n8.  Output  1:  Improved  cooperation  in  technical  and  vocational  education  and \ntraining. A regional framework for the mutual recognition of skills and qualifications in the GMS \n(phase 2) will be developed and piloted. This activity will build on earlier work to develop a skills \nand qualifications recognition framework for three skills (welding, automotive technology, and \ndomestic housekeeping) in the Lao PDR, Thailand, and Viet Nam (phase 1). Under the TA, a \nframework will be developed for recognizing three additional skills and qualifications that are \nmost critical in the development of the economic corridors, and at least one of these skill areas \nwill focus on the poor and maximize opportunities for female employment and participation. \nSecond, a system for the mutual recognition of training standards for TVET teachers and \ntrainers will be developed in the three key skill areas (the same as the three additional skill \nareas in the mutual recognition framework) of greatest importance for the development of the \neconomic corridors.9  \n \n9.  Output  2:  Improved  cooperation  in  higher  education.  GMS  higher  education \nharmonization and networking (phase 2) will be implemented. Based on the achievements in \nphase 1 and lessons and experience from other regions and subregions in Europe and Central \nAsia,10 this activity will collaborate with the AUN in further strengthening the university (internal) \nquality assurance capacity in Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Myanmar,11 and with SEAMEO\u2013\nRIHED in (i) developing the Academic Credit Transfer System Framework for Asia (ACTFA) in \nGMS universities by providing options for harmonizing existing CTSs in selected fields to ensure \napplicability  throughout  Southeast  Asia,  and  (ii)  promoting  GMS  university  networking  by \nsupporting the start-up of the GMS University Consortium.12   \n                                                \n9  The regional frameworks for the mutual recognition of skills and qualifications and training standards for TVET \nteachers and trainers will draw lessons from countries with relevant experience, such as the People\u2019s Republic of \nChina, through knowledge sharing and will be utilized in a proposed GMS TVET project listed in the Regional \nInvestment Framework  HRD sector pipeline.   \n10 Activities under phase 1 included support for conducting initial workshops for capacity development of university \n(internal) quality assurance in collaboration with the AUN, and mapping the existing credit transfer systems and \nschemes involving universities in the GMS in collaboration with SEAMEO\u2013RIHED.  \n11 Viet Nam will be excluded from the activity on strengthening university (internal) quality assurance capacity since it \nhas a relatively well-developed quality assurance system, which was supported by the World Bank. \n12 The AUN comprises 30 leading and/or first-tier universities in ASEAN. At present, a systematic mechanism to build \nsynergy among universities in the GMS is lacking. The GMS University Consortium will complement the AUN by \ninvolving  second-tier  universities  strategically  located  in  GMS  economic  corridors.  The  GMS  University \nConsortium can benefit from strengthened quality assurance capacity and student and faculty exchange with AUN \n ", "4   \n10.  Output 3: Strengthened national implementation and monitoring of the strategic \nframework and action plan. This activity will support country-level implementation of the SFAP, \n2013\u20132017 by national HRD working groups and subgroups, including developing national HRD \naction  plans,  monitoring,  and  annual  reporting  to  the  WGHRD  meetings  on  progress  in \nimplementation. Annual WGHRD meetings will also be held tentatively in Viet Nam (2014), \nCambodia (2015), the People\u2019s Republic of China (2016), and the Lao PDR (2017).   \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The TA is estimated to cost $2,050,000, of which (i) $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V), (ii) $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Regional Cooperation and Integration Fund,13 and (iii) $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction Fund administered by ADB. The six GMS governments will provide counterpart \nsupport in the form of office accommodation, remuneration of counterpart staff, utilities, and \nother in-kind contributions. The cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2.   \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  The executing agency will be ADB. The implementing agencies will be GMS government \nministries responsible for education (TVET and higher education), health, labor and migration, \nand social development, and selected development partners (AUN and SEAMEO\u2013RIHED). ADB \nHRD focal point staff will serve as the secretariat to the GMS WGHRD by (i) assuming their \nresponsibility for overseeing the implementation of activities under the TA, and (ii) liaising with \nGMS  government  ministries  that  comprise  the  WGHRD  and  its  subgroups.  Government \nministries, as implementing agencies, will coordinate activities of national HRD working groups \nand host annual WGHRD meetings. The annual WGHRD meetings will be a mechanism for \nmonitoring the implementation of TA activities and setting an overall direction of the GMS HRD \nwork,  which  will  be  guided  by  the  GMS  senior  official  meetings  and  the  GMS  ministerial \nconferences.  ADB  will  also  collaborate  with  selected  development  partners\u2014the  AUN  and \nSEAMEO\u2013RIHED\u2014as  implementing  agencies.  The  structure  of  the  GMS  WGHRD  and \nimplementation arrangements are in Supplementary Appendix B.     \n \n13.  For output 1, the United Nations or other specialized agency, firm, or research institute will \nbe engaged as a consultant to develop (i) a framework for the mutual recognition of skills and \nqualifications, which are critical to the development of the economic corridors, and (ii) a system for \nthe mutual recognition of training standards for TVET teachers and trainers in the GMS.14 \n \n14.  For output 2, the AUN will continue to be engaged as an implementing agency with \nadvance payment facility to strengthen the university (internal) quality assurance capacity. The \nAUN  is  a  legitimate  regional  partner  to  be  an  implementing  agency  given  that  it  (i)  was \nestablished by ASEAN to help strengthen the network of 30 leading universities in ASEAN, \nincluding the quality assurance system; (ii) offers a regional platform in the university (internal) \nquality assurance system called AUN-Quality Assurance with ASEAN standards; and (iii) was \nengaged  as  an  implementing  agency  to  implement  university  quality  assurance  capacity \nbuilding under Phase 1.   \n                                                \nuniversities. This will help accelerate the harmonization process in higher education in the GMS in quality \nassurance and credit transfer systems and help universities in the GMS to reach ASEAN or Southeast Asian \nregional standards.   \n13 Established by the Asian Development Bank. \n \n14 It is envisaged that the amount to be contracted would be $0.50 million for output 1, comprising two subprojects. \n ", "  5 \n15.  SEAMEO\u2013RIHED will also continue to be engaged as an implementing agency with \nadvance  payment  facility  to  pilot  and  assess  the  ACTFA  in  universities  in  the  GMS,  and \nestablish  the  GMS  University  Consortium  as  a  GMS  university  networking  mechanism. \nSEAMEO\u2013RIHED is also a legitimate regional partner in administering a common CTS and \npromoting university networking given that it (i) is one of the SEAMEO regional centers, which \nspecialize  in  higher  education  harmonization  and  networking;  (ii)  has  the  experience  and \nrespect of governments and higher education institutions in the area of CTS; (iii) was engaged \nas an implementing agency to implement policy action research on a common CTS under \nPhase 1; and (iv) offers a neutral position to serve as a secretariat for the GMS University \nConsortium.  \n \n16.  For  output  3,  an  individual  international  consultant  will  be  engaged  to  assess  the \nimplementation progress of the SFAP, 2013\u20132017. Individual national consultants will also be \nengaged to support (i) country-level implementation of the SFAP, 2013\u20132017, including the \ndevelopment  of  national  HRD  action  plans,  monitoring,  and  annual  reporting  to  WGHRD \nmeetings  on  progress  on  implementation;  and  (ii)  the  preparation  and  delivery  of  annual \nWGHRD meetings, tentatively to be held in Viet Nam in 2014, Cambodia in 2015, the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China in 2016, and the Lao PDR in 2017. Relevant GMS government ministries and \nagencies as implementing agencies will coordinate activities of national HRD working groups \nand host annual WGHRD meetings.    \n \n17.  ADB  will  recruit  the  United  Nations  or  other  specialized  agency,  firm,  or  research \ninstitute to be engaged as a consultant under output 1 using quality-based selection, and an \ninternational consultant (3 person-months) and national consultants (about 90 person-months \nfor 7 positions) as individual consultants under output 3, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2013, as amended from time to time). For the workshops, training, \nseminars, conferences, surveys, and miscellaneous administration and support costs under the \nTA, an advance payment facility will be established at the AUN and SEAMEO\u2013RIHED as \nimplementing agencies.15 TA proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). It is expected that \nthe TA will commence on 1 January 2014 and be completed on 31 December 2017. The outline \nterms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3. ADB will obtain a no-objection letter from \nthe developing member country government before starting any activity financed under this TA \nin the territory of that country. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n18.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction Fund, and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,250,000 \non  a  grant  basis,  for  Implementing  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  Human  Resource \nDevelopment Strategic Framework and Action Plan (Phase 2), and hereby reports this action to \nthe Board.  \n                                                \n15 It is envisaged that the amount to be included in an advance payment facility would be $0.50 million ($0.25 million \nfor the AUN and $0.25 million for SEAMEO\u2013RIHED). Both the AUN and SEAMEO\u2013RIHED have experience and \ncapacity in efficiently using an advance payment facility under Phase 1 and successfully completed the activities \nand liquidated all the advances on time.    \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nPerformance Targets \nDesign  and Indicators with  Data Sources and  Assumptions and \nSummary  Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nImpact  By 2022:    Risk \nIncreased flow of  10% increase in skilled  Migration and  Negative economic, \nskilled labor in the  labor mobility in the GMS  Remittances Fact book  political, and social \nGMS  compared to the    impact of economic \n2013 baseline1  Labor Force Surveys  slowdown \nOutcome  By 2017:    Assumption \nStrengthened HRD  Framework on labor  Labor ministry records  Strong commitment by \ncooperation in the  mobility developed for    GMS governments to \nGMS  consideration by GMS    achieving subregional \ncountries     cooperation and \n    integration in HRD \nFrameworks for university  GMS university records   \nquality assurance and     \ncommon credit transfer  AUN reports \nsystems developed for   \nconsideration by  SEAMEO\u2013RIHED \nuniversities in GMS  reports \ncountries \nOutputs   By 2017:    Assumptions \n1.

To facilitate student mobility across borders in the GMS, the region\u2019s diverse higher \neducation systems need to be harmonized through a permeable and transparent credit transfer \nsystem among universities in the GMS. Encouraging and supporting students to study abroad is \na major strategy to develop a well-trained international workforce. ADB has provided SEAMEO\u2013\nRIHED with funding support under Phase 1 to undertake policy action research to create a \nregional credit transfer system framework. The action research comprised four phases: explore, \nexperiment,  experience,  and  expand.  In  the  explore  phase  (Phase  1),  SEAMEO\u2013RIHED \nproposed a regional credit transfer system framework, referred to as the ACTFA. The ACTFA \naims to boost student mobility in the region by enhancing the effectiveness and applicability of \nexisting credit transfer systems or schemes. More specifically, SEAMEO\u2013RIHED will  \n(i)  recruit universities to participate in the pilot project, and coordinate with a focal \npoint  of  each  selected  university  to  discuss  the  ACTFA  and  a  pilot \nimplementation plan; \n(ii)  pilot the ACTFA in the GMS for one to two academic terms (experiment phase); \n(iii)  evaluate and share lessons from the pilot project including data and synthesis of \nlessons learned (experience phase); and \n(iv)  disseminate the research results and make the ACTFA available for adoption by \nuniversities (expand phase).   \n \nc.  Greater Mekong Subregion University Networking \n \n9.  SEAMEO\u2013RIHED will promote university networking in the GMS which complements the \nexisting AUN with 30 leading (first-tier) universities in Southeast Asia.
