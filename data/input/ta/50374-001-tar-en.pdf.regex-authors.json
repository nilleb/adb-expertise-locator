INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The  proposed  knowledge  and  support  technical  assistance  (TA)  will  assist  the \noperations  departments  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  in  expanding  investment \nopportunities for developing member countries (DMCs) in finance sector development, inclusive \nfinance, and infrastructure finance by demonstrating new solutions with financial innovation, \nincluding in emerging finance areas (such as digital, green, disaster risk, Islamic, municipal, and \nagriculture  finance)  that  can  be  pilot  tested,  scaled  up,  and  replicated.  It  will  support \nimplementation of the action plan and recommendations approved in the midterm review of the \nFinancial Sector Operational Plan (FSOP) and Finance Sector Group (FSG) work plan.1 It will \nenable knowledge sharing in emerging finance areas with cross-sector impact for sustainable \nfinance sector development in DMCs, and enable them to strengthen finance sector resilience. \nThe TA will support current and future DMC initiatives related to finance sector development, \ninclusive finance, and infrastructure finance. The selection of participating DMCs in the TA will \nbe done in consultation with ADB operations departments and confirmed following government \nclearance and TA approval. \n \n2.  Strategy  2020,  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework,  addresses  the  importance  of \nfinance sector development as a core specialization.2 The 2014 Midterm Review of Strategy \n2020 reconfirmed the focus areas of ADB\u2019s strategic support, including finance.3 The FSOP \narticulated  the  finance  agendas  of  Strategy  2020.  Its  midterm  review,  completed  in  2016, \nexamined the implementation of its action plan, related assistance, and its adequacy for the \nchallenges ahead. The proposed TA is included in the management-approved FSG work plan.4 \nWhile the TA is not included in ADB\u2019s regional cooperation operations business plans, it has \nbeen prepared in consultation with operations departments. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Developing Asia faces a challenging global environment. Since the global financial crisis \nof 2008\u20132009, global economic expansion has consistently fallen below expectations.5 Growth \nhas slowed because of the continued weak recovery in major industrial economies and softer \ngrowth prospects for the People\u2019s Republic of China. Volatility in global financial markets, which \nstems from weaknesses in emerging markets and monetary tightening in the United States, is \ndeepening the uncertainty stirred by the global slowdown. Uncertainties abound in the global \neconomic environment, and risks to developing Asia\u2019s growth are mostly increasing. \n \n4.  Despite achievements so far, many of Asia\u2019s developing countries face challenging and \noften volatile macroeconomic environments for finance sector development, which typically lags \ndeveloped economies. Most countries in the region also face declining potential economic \ngrowth, aging populations, rising risks from climate change and disasters resulting from natural \nhazards, and a growing need to maintain financial stability in a more volatile world. Differences \nin per capita income, growth rates, and populations generate widely different levels of finance \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2017.

Midterm Review of Strategy 2020: Meeting the Challenges of a Transforming Asia and Pacific. Manila. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 4 July 2017. \n5  In the comparison between 2005 and 2015, 26 out of 31 countries from Central, West, East, South, and Southeast \nAsia largely decelerated the pace of economic growth (ADB.2016. Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific2016. \nManila. p.141).  \n ", "2 \nsector development that must be paid attention to when customizing solutions in the finance \nsector\u2014and hence the potential to replicate solutions from other country contexts. \n \n5.  Finance is a critical component driving national economies, and  governments need \nrobust  financial  systems  to  ensure  a  timely  and  adequate  response  to  uncertainties  and \nchanges in the financial architecture. ADB\u2019s DMC governments need to enhance their capacity \nto strengthen finance sector resilience against unexpected events, including financial crises, to \nensure sustainable economic growth and social welfare enhancement at the national level. \n \n6.  Finance has a cross-cutting impact on all sectors, industries, and economic activities. It \nalso  affects  global  development  agendas,  which  can  directly  or  indirectly  contribute  to \nmacroeconomic and social goals, including economic growth, poverty reduction, and inequality \nmitigation; and solve development issues such as health, education, gender, infrastructure, and \nclimate change, as stated in the Sustainable Development Goals.6 Given its multidimensional \nimpact, the finance sector should equip a sophisticated system with innovative solutions that \nmake the best use of digital technology, which is an urgent need for DMCs. The use of digital \ntechnology will help develop financial products and services with low-cost and fast transactions \nto promote finance sector development, inclusive finance, and infrastructure finance. \n \n7.  ADB has attached importance to finance sector development in Strategy 2020, and set \nup the FSOP in 2011 to articulate its implementation.7 In 2016, ADB conducted a midterm \nreview of the FSOP to assess finance sector operational performance, extract key constraints \nand challenges, and recommend scaling up quality finance sector operations. Key findings of \nthe review include retaining focus on three key themes: finance sector development, inclusive \nfinance, and infrastructure finance. It also identified the need to develop capacities and project \nportfolio development in emerging finance areas that have a cross-cutting sector impact. \n \n8.  Finance sector development, inclusive finance, and infrastructure finance are key policy \npriorities in most DMCs. Empirical evidence suggests strong links among sound finance sector \ndevelopment, real sector economic growth, employment, and poverty alleviation.8 DMCs such \nas Indonesia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Pakistan, and the Philippines have established national \nfinancial inclusion strategies to enhance access to finance for the unbanked or underserved \npopulation, including low-income households; and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises.9 \nAsia shows strong demand for infrastructure development and finance, estimated at $26 trillion \nfrom 2016 to 2030, or $1.7 trillion per year, if the region is to maintain its growth momentum, \neradicate poverty, and respond to climate change (climate-adjusted estimate).10 \n \n9.  Developing emerging finance areas with cross-sector impact will provide new solutions \nfor promoting the three key themes. Given the advent of financial technology, financial services \nthrough digital channels\u2014such as mobile banking and internet banking\u2014and agent banking can \nprovide cost-effective ways to scale-up access to finance for the traditionally unbanked or \nunderserved segments, help them move out of poverty, and ensure financial security efficiently. \n                                                \n6  United  Nations.

This  TA  will  build  on  TA  projects  such  as  the  TA  on  Unlocking  Innovation  for \nDevelopment12 and Establishing the Future Cities Program in the Asia and Pacific Region.13 It \nsupports core themes addressed in the midterm review of the FSOP and the FSG work plan\u2014\nfinance  sector  development,  inclusive  finance,  and  infrastructure  finance.  Under  these  TA \nprojects, ADB has explored pilot projects that promote financial inclusion through digital financial \nservices. These include replicable and scalable solutions\u2014such as cloud technology for core \nbanking in the Philippines,14 a cloud-based digital platform for nonbank financial institutions in \nMongolia, and digitization of field-based processes for loan processing in Georgia15\u2014that are \nlinked to ongoing or pipeline projects in operations departments. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA will be aligned with the following impact: enabling environment for investment \nopportunities in domestic financial markets of DMCs improved (footnote 9). The TA will have the \nfollowing outcome: capacity of DMCs to promote finance sector development enhanced at the \nnational level.16 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n12.  The TA  has  two  outputs: (i)  pilot  projects for  investment  opportunities  in  emerging \nfinance  areas  identified,  and  (ii)  cross-sector  knowledge  on  financial  solutions  delivered. \nThrough pilot testing and knowledge sharing, the TA will help DMCs (i) develop a holistic policy \nframework that responds to the needs of emerging finance areas, (ii) fill the supply\u2013demand gap \nin infrastructure development and finance, and (iii) facilitate collaboration between finance and \nreal sectors in business development. \n \n13.  Output 1: Pilot projects for investment opportunities in emerging finance areas \nidentified. In close collaboration with operations departments and sector and thematic groups, \nthe TA will (i) develop at least three feasibility studies for pilot projects in emerging business \nareas  in  emerging  areas  identified  in  the  review  of  the  FSOP;  (ii)  identify  investment \nopportunities for pilot projects and programs supporting finance sector development in at least \none DMC using digital technology and innovative solutions. It will support the implementation of \nthe ongoing pilot project in the Philippines using cloud technology for core banking.  \n \n14.  Output  2:  Cross-sector  knowledge  on  financial  solutions  delivered.  In  close \ncollaboration  with  operational  departments  and  Economic  and  Regional  Cooperation \nDepartment, the TA will deliver knowledge solutions for DMCs to develop resilient finance \n                                                \n11  McKinsey & Company. 2016.
