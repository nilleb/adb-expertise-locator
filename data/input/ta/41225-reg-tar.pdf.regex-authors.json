At that time, overdependence on bank financing forced borrowers to \ntake on excessive short-term foreign exchange exposure to finance long-term projects that \ncould generate only local currency revenue, resulting in mismatches with respect to both loan \nmaturity and exchange rates.1 When international confidence in one local currency caused a \nrapid depreciation against the United States (US) dollar, a payment crisis ensued, exacerbating \na loss in confidence across the region (the \u201ccontagion\u201d effect). This led to banking and currency \ncrises in several countries. Structural reforms were implemented throughout the region, and \nmost crisis-affected economies have recovered and returned to robust growth. However, the \nabsence of alternative sources 2 of long-term local-currency financing and the region\u2019s lack of \nefficient bond markets continue to be a source of potential financial vulnerability. \n \n2.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)+33 finance ministers established \nthe Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI) in August 2003 to boost development of local currency \nbond markets to help mitigate the double mismatch problem, and channel Asian savings to the \nregion. Currently, the ABMI Focal Groupand four working groups4 (WGs) focus on (i) expanding \n \nthe number and diversifying the makeup of issuers on local currency bond markets, and (ii) \ndeveloping an environment conducive and attractive to bond market participants. The Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) has supported the ABMI since its inception, particularly through the \nprovision of technical assistance (TA).The ABMI also complements work done by other regional \n \nforums on bond market development, including the Executives\u2019 Meeting of the East Asia-Pacific \nCentral Banks (EMEAP) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC).5 \n \n3.  In March 2007, at the ASEAN+3 Finance Ministers' Meeting in Japan, the ABMI Working \nGroup on Creating New Securitized Debt Instruments (WG1) requested ADB to undertake a \nstudy on financing infrastructure projects with bond issues, particularly ASEAN+3 local currency \nbonds, and to identify available or possible debt instruments for financing domestic and cross-\nborder  infrastructure  projects  in  the  region.  The  concept  paper  was  approved  by  ADB \nmanagement on 17 July 2007.6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  A  major  priority  for  ASEAN+3  is  finding  a  way  to  finance  the  region\u2019s  massive \ninfrastructure  demand.  This  is  of  particular  concern  in  rapidly  urbanizing  areas.  Various \n                                                 \n1  Loan maturities became too divergent, to the detriment of both local creditors and borrowers, and the currencies in \nwhich the loans were made became vulnerable to exchange rate volatility or, worse, local currency exchange rate \ndepreciation. \n2   Bank loans have, in most cases, 5-10 years tenor. \n3  ASEAN+3  comprise  the  10  members  of  ASEAN  (Brunei  Darussalam,  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  Lao  People\u2019s \nDemocratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam) and People\u2019s Republic \nof China (PRC), Japan, and Republic of Korea. \n4  The four WGs are: WG1\u2014New Securitized Debt Instruments (chaired by Thailand); WG2\u2014Regional Credit \nGuarantee  and  Investment  Mechanism  (the  PRC  and  the  Republic  of  Korea);  WG3\u2014Foreign  Exchange \nTransaction and Settlement Issues (Malaysia); WG4\u2014Rating Systems and Dissemination of Information (Japan \nand Singapore). In addition to the four WGs are: (i) the TA Coordination (Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines) \nand (ii) the Ad-Hoc Support Team to the Focal Group, an apex body that oversees overall ABMI progress. \n5  EMEAP initiatives include enhancing the demand-side for bond market development through the Asian Bond \nFunds 1 and 2. APEC initiatives include diversifying of bond products. \n6  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 July 2007.  \n ", "2   \nestimates7 indicate that East Asia needs approximately $162 billion per year from 2005 to 2010 \n(equal to about 6.2% of the region\u2019s aggregate gross domestic product) for basic infrastructure \nspending (for electricity, telecommunications, water and sanitation and transportation). About \n65%  is  for  new  investments  and  35%  for  maintenance  of  existing  facilities.8 When  other \ninfrastructure needs (such as airports, ports, bridges, and urban transport) are included, the \noverall estimate rises to $200 billion per year (footnote 7).  \n \n5.  Given  the  globalization  of  financial  markets  and  the  growing  array  of  sophisticated \ninstruments available, infrastructure finance can now include a mix of local and international \nfunding (e.g., syndicated bank loans, structured finance equipment leasing, and bonds). Private \ninvestment  in  East  Asian  infrastructure  has  totaled  about  $190  billion  since  1990;  such \ninvestment peaked in the mid-1990s, and comprised a minor share (about 20% to 25%) of total \ninfrastructure investment in the developing world, as well as in much of the developed world \n(footnote 7). The severe resource constraints make financing needed infrastructure a huge \nchallenge for most of ASEAN+3.  \n \n6.  Reasons for the recent slowdown in private sector investment in infrastructure projects \ninclude  inefficient  pricing  policies,  ineffective  delivery  systems,  and  inconsistent  regulatory \nframeworks (bankruptcy proceedings and bureaucratic inefficiencies) (footnote 7). From 2001 to \n2005,  East  Asia  and  the  Pacific  accounted  for  about  18%  of  total  private  investment  in \ninfrastructure in all developing countries, down from 27% for 1990\u20132000. This was despite \nconsistently strong economic growth as the region recovered from the Asian financial crisis.  \n \n7.  There are various types of bonds (government bonds, corporate bonds, revenue bonds \nand project bonds) that can be issued to finance infrastructure projects. Infrastructure bonds can \nbe a more efficient form of financing as it meets the long term nature of infrastructure financing \nwhich is often not available from the banking system. It also brings more transparency to the \ntransaction and the financial market as a whole. To convince the private sector to increase its \nparticipation  in  infrastructure  financing,  ASEAN+3  governments  need  to  continue  financial \nmarket reforms, and foster an investment environment conducive to private contractual activities \nto develop efficient market for infrastructure bond financing. Contractual, political, and regulatory \nrisks  and  investor  protection  provisions  have  to  be  re-examined  and  adequate  measures \nadopted  to  stimulate  local,  regional,  and  international  investment  in  infrastructure  bonds. \nFurthermore,  given  the  considerable  savings  and  accumulated  foreign  exchange  reserves \navailable in the region, the ASEAN+3 countries are looking to tap regional bond markets for \nlong-term infrastructure investment. Infrastructure financing diversification\u2014by adding bonds to \nexisting sources, which include governments, external official development assistance, and \nloans\u2014will  benefit  the  region.  Regional  bond  markets  face  several  constraints,  however, \nincluding their size, relative illiquidity, and regulatory environments, and these do not foster \ninvestor confidence. In addition, the lack of adequate investor protection measures and poor \nenforcement of securities laws by regulators can discourage investment in infrastructure bonds.   \n \n8.  Improvements in the creditworthiness of potential bond issuers will be needed to attract \nlocal, regional, and international investors. The recent turbulence in the credit market9 requires \nimproving the transparency of the rating process for structured transactions through (i) better \nvaluation and accounting of off-balance sheet risks, and (ii) strengthening of risk management \n                                                 \n7  Such as the study jointly conducted by ADB, Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and World Bank, \n2005, and United Nations Economic and Social Committee for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) study in 2006. \n8  ADB, JBIC, and World Bank. 2005. Connecting East Asia: A New Framework for Infrastructure. Manila, Tokyo, and \nWashington, DC. \n9 The proposed RETA Developing Securitization Market in ASEAN+3 is expected to examine this issue in detail. \n ", "  3\ntechniques  employed  by  financial  institutions  and  credit  rating  agencies.10 To  minimize \nregulatory risk, reforms in the regulatory and supervisory frameworks in most member country \nfinancial  sectors  will  also  be  needed.  To  meet  developing  countries\u2019  infrastructure  project \nfinancing needs in the region, the role of multilateral development banks (MDBs) in helping \nASEAN+3 countries develop the regional infrastructure bond market should also be explored.11  \n \n9.     ADB has undertaken studies on infrastructure financing for developing member countries \nin the region, including a study on the development of bond markets for infrastructure financing \nin Asia.12 Studies on infrastructure finance in the ASEAN+3 region13  have also been undertaken \nby external parties such as JBIC and Fitch Ratings. This project will build on the studies and \nlessons  learned  from  the  ADB,  JBIC  and  other  projects  on  infrastructure  bond  financing.  \nPrevious studies will be reviewed and consolidated to avoid any duplication of previous efforts. \n \n10.  The size of the infrastructure financing gap for the ASEAN+3 region highlights the need \nfor cooperative efforts to bring new sources of capital into the region. ASEAN+3 member \ncountries  need  to  work  together  to  find  effective  financing  mechanisms  to  stimulate \ninfrastructure project investment; this would be more efficient than individual countries seeking \nto independently access the limited available funds to finance their own infrastructure needs.14  \n \nIII.  TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n11.  The TA aims to promote the development of infrastructure bonds denominated in local \ncurrency, facilitate the issuances of such bonds, and encourage investment in and trading of \ncross-border infrastructure bonds. Efficient local currency bond markets will help channel the \nregion\u2019s substantial savings to fund long-term development needs, and could partially fill the \nhuge demand for infrastructure financing. The TA will cover ASEAN+3 countries, focusing on \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Viet Nam. The \nexpected outcome is that the ASEAN+3 officials will be provided with the basis to make an \ninformed decision on the development of bond market for infrastructure projects.  \n \n12.  The TA supports ADB's Office of Regional Economic Integration (OREI) strategy and the \nRegional Cooperation and Integration Strategy, including (i) Pillar 2 (Trade and Investment \nCooperation), which supports cross-border infrastructure development as a means of fostering \nregional cooperation to facilitate trade and investment; and (ii) Pillar 3 (Monetary and Financial \nCooperation), which supports the development of bond financing for infrastructure projects to (a) \nsupport  regional  financial  cooperation  and  integration  through  increased  cross-border  \ntransactions, and (b) promote greater financial stability in the region. The TA will complement \nactivities to promote infrastructure projects by ADB's Regional and Sustainable Development \nDepartment, Private Sector Operations Department, and regional departments. \n \n                                                 \n10 ADB. 2008.

All stages of the study will be done in consultation with market participants through \nmeetings and/or conferences and will increase existing dialogue with other stakeholders and \npolicy makers. The design will be relatively flexible to accommodate views from the private \nsector and from government officials obtained throughout implementation. ADB and the TA \nconsultants will communicate regularly with the WG1 chair and members to discuss output and \nto  develop  appropriate  policy  recommendations.  The  scope  of  the  study,  with  preliminary \nagreement from WG1 members, includes the following components. \n \n14.  Debt Market Analysis for Infrastructure Projects. The study will (i) provide a short \nbackground on the infrastructure demands of the region, (ii) describe the existing sources of \nfunding  and  mechanisms  employed  by  the  ASEAN+3  countries  in  funding  infrastructure \nprojects, and (iii) identify the benefits of bond financing. The study will first discuss the different \ntypes of bonds that can be issued to finance infrastructure. It will then identify legal, regulatory, \nand market constraints to issuing bonds to finance infrastructure projects in the region, including \nconstraints that hinder private sector participation in infrastructure investment. Where bond \nmarkets  are  relatively  developed,  it  will  analyze  the  readiness  of  such  markets  to  issue \ninfrastructure bonds, define market conditions for available bond products, and identify risk \nmitigation instruments (including hedging instruments and guarantee mechanisms) that are \navailable or in use. Taking into consideration the differences in the stages of bond market \ndevelopment in these countries, the study will identify particular issues relating to structured \nfinance that hinder, or even prevent, the use of bond financing to fund infrastructure projects. \nPotential  investors  in  and  issuers  of  infrastructure  bonds  from  the  local,  regional,  and \ninternational markets will be identified. Country studies in nascent markets such as Viet Nam \nwill focus on basic information about their bond markets. The study will also examine existing \npolicy and regulatory frameworks for bond issuance and the role of governments in promoting \nprivate sector participation in infrastructure financing.  \n \n15.  Lessons. Innovative infrastructure bond financing schemes are thriving in developed \nmarkets in countries outside the region, including the US and Europe. Firms in the US are even \nbeginning to market infrastructure as a separate asset class, one with risks similar to those of \nbonds, but with returns similar to those in the stock market.  \n \n16.  Only a few countries in the region have successfully and actively issued infrastructure \nproject bonds. The study will include a review of the policy framework that helped foster a \nfavorable  environment  for  infrastructure  bond  financing  in  these  countries.  Successful \ngovernment incentive schemes, such as those employed by Singapore,15 will be analyzed. \nADB's extensive experience and perspective in financing infrastructure projects and providing \nassistance in bond market development efforts in the region will also be reviewed and relevant \nlessons taken into account, where these can assist ASEAN+3 governments formulate their own \ninfrastructure  financing  incentives  and  schemes.  The  study  will  also  identify  the  types  of \ninfrastructure projects and project schemes most suitable for bond financing. \n \n17.  Role of Government and Infrastructure Bond Development Strategies. The study \nwill examine the government\u2019s role in promoting infrastructure bond financing, and in particular \nthe provision of incentives to encourage private sector participation. The findings of the debt \nmarket review and the experiences of both developed and developing markets will be presented \n                                                 \n15 Singapore facilitates infrastructure bond financing through incentives such as tax exemptions on interest income \nand favorable tax rates for services such as arranging, underwriting, and distributing projects. \n ", "  5\nto the ASEAN+3 governments. Based on the results of the review, the study will develop a \nregional action plan to create an environment conducive to infrastructure bond development; \nthis may also include a list of infrastructure projects eligible for bond financing. \n \n18.  Case Studies and Best Practices. The study will identify the conditions necessary for \ninfrastructure project bond financing. Based on a review of financing schemes used in more \ndeveloped economies, five case studies and a set of best practices for infrastructure bond \nfinancing will be prepared to guide ASEAN+3 authorities in reviewing their financing strategies \nto determine the adjustments needed to attract local, regional, and international investors to \ninvest in their infrastructure bonds.  \n \n19.  Recommendations.  A  set  of  recommendations  will  be  submitted  to  WG1  on  an \nappropriate strategy and policies that may be adopted by individual ASEAN+3 countries to \nachieve the objective of increasing bond financing for infrastructure projects across the region. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n20.  The  total  cost  of  the study  is  estimated  at  $700,000  equivalent.  The  study  will  be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Japan Special Fund, funded by the Government of Japan. \nDetailed cost estimates and a financing plan are in Appendix 2. ASEAN+3 members will finance \nthe costs of individual WG1 activities and of participation in WG1 activities. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  ADB  will  be  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  TA,  which  will  be  administered  and \nimplemented by OREI in close consultation with WG1 member countries, particularly Thailand \n(the WG1 chair). ADB will supervise the work of the TA consultants. \n \n22.  Three international consultants and one national consultant will be engaged for a total of \n17  person-months  of  international  consultancy  services  and  12  person-months  of  national \nconsultancy  services.  The  consultants  will  be  hired  and  engaged  by  ADB  as  individual \nconsultants in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). The outline of the terms of reference for the consultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n23.  The study will be implemented over a 14-month period, and is expected to start in May \n2008 and to end by June 2009. A series of market consultations with market players and \ngovernment officials will be held within 5 months after commencement. With these inputs, as \nwell as those from government officials, the interim report will be submitted to WG1 within 6 \nmonths. A final presentation to WG1 is expected in June 2009. The outline of the final report is \nin Appendix 4. Upon completion, the report will be disseminated within ADB and on appropriate \nwebsites,16 with external publication of the report subject to approval by WG1 members. \n \nIV.
