INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will deliver assistance to operations \ndepartments and developing member countries (DMCs) through knowledge products and project \nidentification to enable the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to strengthen innovation in its \ntransport assistance and meet the emerging requests from its DMCs. The TA will focus on \ntechnical  and  information  innovation.  Technical  innovation  will  focus  on  electric mobility to \ndecarbonize transport, artificial intelligence, and shared mobility. Information innovation will focus \non  transport  system  management  such  as  intelligent  transport  systems  (ITS),  transport \ninformation systems, passenger information system, travel demand management, and freight and \nlogistics information services. The TA will help prepare an innovative future lending pipeline and \nembed the latest technical and operations innovation in sector assistance. The TA will raise \nawareness of emerging technologies and use of data and information to provide more efficient \ntransport sector support for ADB\u2019s clients. The TA is aligned with Strategy 2030 operational \npriorities 1, 2, 3, and 4; relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDG); and the Paris Agreement \non climate change.  \n \n2.  The TA is included in the 2021 Management-approved results-based work plan of the \nSustainable Development and Climate Change Department and in the transport sector work plan, \n2021\u20132022.1 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Transport is at a crossroad in its development. Not since the mechanical innovations of \nthe steam train or the internal combustion engine has transport been on the cusp of innovations \nthat can revolutionize the sector. The information age can transform accessibility and mobility. \nThe TA will ensure ADB remains at the forefront of any sector innovations, and thus able to \nsupport  DMC  and  private  sector  clients  with  the  latest  technical,  policy,  and  operational \nknowledge and solutions. Given the range of needs and capacity of DMCs a differentiated \napproach will be taken in terms of assessing and applying transport sector innovations to \ncountries with different transport needs and requirements. \n \n4.  Since the 1960s, the focus has been on building transport infrastructure networks, which \nhas ensured that transport has been able to largely fulfill its role as an enabler of development. \nThe emerging requirements are for improved accessibility and operations of transport systems to \nenhance efficiencies. ADB\u2019s client DMCs, through the large number of engineer graduates and \nincreasingly competent contracting entities, are capable of designing and building much of the \ntransport infrastructure. However, DMCs are increasingly seeking help in the policy, planning, \noperations,  management,  monitoring,  and  reporting  of  more  complex  multimodal  transport \nsystems and services. ADB requires the TA to ensure it can continue to support its clients and \nprovide a detailed understanding of the latest innovations and operational efficiencies. \n \n5.  The transport sector has traditionally been a large part of ADB assistance, accounting for \n25% of project approvals with an average of $4.4 billion investment per year between 2010 and \n2019.2 To ensure ADB continues to offer relevant and value-added support in this important sector, \nADB must strengthen its knowledge and use of innovations that are influencing the future of \ntransport. The sector support is expected to maintain current lending levels while shifting to more \nprogrammatic support, as well as in addressing the externalities such as congestion, road crashes, \n \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 22 June 2021. \n2  ADB. 2021. ADB Annual Report 2020. Manila.  \n ", "2 \nair quality, and carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions. The TA will ensure the sector maintains its large \n2\nportfolio while embracing new technical and information innovations. \n \n6.  Strategy 2030 and the seven operational priorities have given a thematic focus to ADB \ncorporate  objectives  and  focus  areas.3 ADB  is  committed  to  support  DMCs  meet  their \ncommitments to the SDG and the Paris Agreement. While infrastructure sectors remain a focus \nfor ADB, sector assistance must align with these strategic objectives and fully support sustainable \ndevelopment while addressing the negative externalities. This will require a shift in the type and \nscope of ADB\u2019s transport sector assistance, which has traditionally been dominated by large \ninfrastructure that was required to meet physical gaps in the transport network, to one that \nsupports operational efficiencies and embraces new innovations. The TA will ensure ADB remains \nrelevant and able to offer value-added support to its clients and do so in focus areas such as \npoverty,  climate  change,  and  gender,  with  information  innovations  providing  more  robust \nassessment of the sector\u2019s role and impact. \n \n7.  Strategy 2030 includes the need for a differentiated approach for clients at different stages \nof development. The more traditional road construction support is still relevant in many of ADB\u2019s \nlower income DMCs, as well as in small island developing states and fragile and conflict-affected \nsituation countries. This type of support should and will continue. In those DMCs reaching or \nalready in middle-income levels, the demands for assistance focus on new technologies and \ninnovations in operational practices. DMC clients are dealing with complex transport issues. They \nare facilitating the increased travel demand resulting from continued and growing economic \ndevelopment, and at the same time dealing with the negative externalities such as congestion, \nvehicle emissions, road safety, and inefficient transport systems. \n \n8.  The TA will enable ADB transport operations to address the recommendations from the \nrecent Independent Evaluation Department\u2019s sector assessment and achieve greater impact at \nthe scale required.4 The report highlighted the need to focus in key areas of road maintenance, \nroad safety, climate change, and urban transport using suitable lending modalities. Information \ninnovations can allow suitable policy and programs to transform the type of support ADB can \nprovide. The TA will enable ADB to build on other activities such as the Asian Transport Outlook \nto undertake policy dialogue with DMCs based on improved transport information databases, \nusing data to drive innovation in areas such as road asset management, road safety, urban \ntransport (including non-motorized transport), rail system operations, and water-borne transport. \nThe TA will allow ADB to measure the externalities and report back on the sector\u2019s impacts on \ngrowth, emissions, and operational efficiencies, many of which are aligned with the SDGs, such \nas 3.6 on road safety, 3.9 on air quality, 7.3 on energy efficiency and e-mobility, 9.1 on rural \naccessibility, 11.2 on urban accessibility, and 13 on climate change. For ADB to provide support \non SDGs and the Paris Agreement, we need to move beyond infrastructure projects to system \ntransformation and operational reform. \n \n9.  International travel expediated the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The \nsubsequent travel restrictions and lockdowns have had significant impact on the sector, notably \nin passenger-based air travel and public transport systems. ADB prepared an assessment of the \nCOVID-19  impacts  to  assist  our  DMCs  in  the  various  stages  of  lockdown  and  recovery.5 \nCOVID-19 also demonstrated the need to pandemic-proof our transport systems and, in the \n \n3  ADB. 2018.

The use of technical and information innovations has the ability to align future transport \noperations with  Strategy 2030. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n11.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Investments in green, sustainable, resilient, \nand inclusive quality infrastructure promoted (footnote 3). The TA will have the following outcome: \ninnovation in transport sector assistance in selected DMCs increased.6 This will be achieved \nthrough two outputs: (i) technical innovation initiatives in DMCs developed and implemented, and \n(ii) information innovation initiatives in DMCs developed and implemented. \n \n12.  Innovation for decarbonizing the transport sector is a key focus of the TA. Building on the \nADB report on e-mobility options for developing member countries, ADB, through the TA, will \nmainstream the support into its technical and financial assistance in those DMCs and private \nsector clients that the report identified as priorities.7 There is great scope for the rapid uptake of \ninnovative e-mobility technologies and for the wholesale decarbonization, initial support will focus \non those DMCs that are more advanced in terms of enabling policy and with lower carbon power \ngeneration grid factors. The growth in electric and plug-in hybrid cars is rapid: in 2017, there were \n3 million vehicles; in 2020, there were 4.5 million, or 5% of global passenger car sales; by 2030s, \nthis is expected to reach 20% of global vehicles sales.8 How can this transformative innovation \nfor decarbonization be rolled out to all DMCs and help mitigate CO  emissions in the transport \n2\nsector? \n \n13.  However,  electric  passenger  cars  are  only  part  of  the  solution.  With  Asia\u2019s  heavy \ndependence on two- and three-wheelers, as well as public transport in urban areas, there is a \nrange of e-mobility solutions. The People\u2019s Republic of China dominates the electric two-wheeler \nmarket with a vehicle stock estimated at 200 million to 230 million units.9 In 2017, there were \nnearly 400,000 electric buses operating worldwide, with 99% of the total in the People\u2019s Republic \nof China.10 In freight vehicles, electric trucks circulate in small numbers; it is expected that after \n2025, light- and medium-duty electric trucks could start to penetrate and transform the market \n(with heavy-duty trucks to follow later).11 With Asia a leading area for e-mobility, ADB must \nembrace this innovative technology and support all DMCs in its widescale uptake and work with \nprivate sector clients in system development. \n \n14.  ADB DMCs and private sector clients are increasingly seeking help from ADB in areas of \ntransport operational efficiencies such as in urban transport system management, ITS, rail system \noperations, and road asset management, as well as in the broader institutional governance, policy, \nand  planning  of  transport  systems.  Innovations  in  the  use  of  data  and  technologies  can \nsignificantly impact how ADB provides support and support operations departments in due \n \n6  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n7  J.

Road  network  asset \nmanagement programs can be monitored via satellite imagery and coupled with accelerometers \nto measure road condition to prioritize maintenance activities, monitor, and report on work carried \nout. The improved governance that data innovations can provide can revolutionize the road asset \nmanagement program in many DMCs. Urban transport systems can utilize data and information \ninnovations to increase operational efficiencies and throughput on space constrained transport \nsystems. Passenger information apps can provide real time information on route options, travel \ntimes, and links to payment systems. Rail transport can be transformed using  information \nmanagement systems to better plan services and monitor costs and operations. The logistics and \nfreight  operations  at  both  local  and  international  levels  also  can  benefit  significantly  from \ninformation innovations to better match demand to supply. Selected DMCs will be used as \ndemonstration pilots for information innovations. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n15.  Output  1:  Technical  innovation  initiatives  in  developing  member  countries \ndeveloped and implemented. Technical innovations will allow the transport sector to address \nlarge and rapidly growing emissions. The uptake of and transition to e-mobility can dramatically \nreduce CO  emissions from the sector, as well as address local emissions such as particulate \n2\nmatter, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide. The TA will provide policy support, project design \nsupport, and program development in selected DMCs on e-mobility solutions to transition to zero \nemission transport systems, including e-vehicle road maps.12 The TA will also explore possible \nsupport in artificial intelligence, shared mobility, and emerging areas of technical innovation in \ntransport, including non-motorized and water-borne transport. \n \n16.  Output  2:  Information  innovation  initiatives  in  developing  member  countries \ndeveloped and implemented. The TA will prepare various forms of information innovations that \nwill  help  operations  departments  strengthen  assistance  to  selected  DMCs.  Improved  data \ncollection and analysis will be used to facilitate enhanced dialogue with client DMCs. The data \nwill be used to identify and develop focus areas of support that address the broader externalities, \nin addition to infrastructure project support. The information innovations will be used to support \nthe development of sector action plans and programs that address SDGs and Paris Agreement \nrelating to the transport sector. The TA will use innovative information systems to develop a \npipeline  of  technically-advanced  assistance  in  intelligent  urban  transport  system,  traffic \nmanagement,  rail  network  operations,  passenger  information  systems,  transport  system \nmonitoring, travel demand management, and reporting systems. \n \n17.  This TA will support focus areas of Strategy 2030 through improved data, policy dialogue, \nenhanced country partnership strategy, and assistance pipeline development. The main direction \nof the information innovation activities will be supporting operations departments operations \ntowards Strategy 2030 through knowledge support, project development, and implementation \nsupport. The new TA will support technical and information innovation in all transport subsectors \nin policy advice and program and project development and implementation: urban transport, \nrailways (urban and regional), roads (regional and rural), aviation and port, and new technologies \nfor e-mobility and smart transport. \n \n18.  The TA will provide direct support to operations departments in the following subsectors: \nintelligent urban transport, e-mobility, data collection and analysis, and new technology. The TA \nwill also include capacity-building activities and knowledge support of staff and clients. \n \n12 DMCs will be selected by the enabling environment and the electric grid factor. \n ", "5 \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n19.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,750,000 of which (i) $750,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF) ($250,000 from TASF 7 and $500,000 \nfrom TASF-other sources), and (ii) $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the High-Level \nTechnology Fund13 and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. \n \n20.  The use of the High-Level Technology Fund will follow the plan submitted and approved by \nthe fund\u2019s steering committee, following the fund\u2019s implementation guidelines.
