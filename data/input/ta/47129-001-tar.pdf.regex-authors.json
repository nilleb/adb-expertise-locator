INTRODUCTION \n1.  This regional technical assistance (TA) is designed to support the continued work of the \nRegional Power Trade Coordination Committee (RPTCC), the Working Group on Performance \nStandards and Grid Codes (WGPG), and the Working Group on Regulatory Issues (WGRI) to \nfacilitate  regional  power  trade  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion  (GMS).1 Through  these \ninstitutions, much more will be done by the GMS members themselves in developing a full-\nfledged GMS  power  market  where  all  countries  can  realize  and  share  the full  benefits  of \nsynchronous  operations.  Interventions  include  (i)  establishment  of  the  Regional  Power \nCoordination  Center  (RPCC);  (ii)  harmonizing  performance  standards  and  grid  codes  that \ndictate the technical rules for the coordinated planning and operation of the regional electricity \nmarket; and (iii) harmonizing the regulatory framework, pricing, legal framework for third-party \ngrid access, and wheeling obligations, all of which contribute to development of a unified, fair, \nand transparent regional electricity market. This TA is aligned with ADB\u2019s Strategy 2020\u2014and \nespecially  the  regional  integration  development  agenda\u2014and  ADB\u2019s  Energy  Policy.2 It  is \nlikewise aligned with the GMS Regional Cooperation Operation Business Plan, 2013\u20132014 \n(which implements the Regional Cooperation Strategy and Program), as well as the GMS \nEconomic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework, 2012\u20132022.3 The design and monitoring \nframework is in Appendix 1.4 \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The GMS is well endowed with energy resources, including 229 gigawatts of potential \nhydropower, about 1.2 billion cubic meters of proven reserves of natural gas, 28 billion tons of \ncoal, and 0.8 billion tons of oil. But these energy resources are unevenly distributed throughout \nthe GMS. Thus, since the launch of the GMS Economic Cooperation Program in 1992, energy \nwas identified as one of the nine areas for subregional cooperation, focusing on the regional \npower trade and grid interconnection. Starting with the 1999 Policy Statement on Regional \nPower  Trade,  GMS  members  have  consistently  affirmed  the  principles  of  cooperation, \ngradualism, and respect for the environment.5 They concur that the regional power trade will \ndevelop in phases, and that a regional market will evolve through institutional strengthening and \nreforms, as well as infrastructure development, influenced by sustainable energy, environment, \nand social factors.6  \n \n3.  A regional TA for Facilitating Regional Power Trading and Environmentally Sustainable \nDevelopment of Electricity Infrastructure in the Greater Mekong Subregion, completed in June \n2012,  was  implemented  by  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  and  financed  by  the \nGovernment of Sweden through the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency.7 \nThe  TA  helped  foster  and  address  the  environmental  aspects  of  regional  power \n                                                \n1  The Regional Power Trade Coordination Committee has been operating since 2003 to implement regional power \ntrade in accordance with the Intergovernmental Agreement in Regional Power Trade. The two working groups were \nformed in 2011 (para 4). \n2  ADB. 2008. Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila; ADB. 2009.

Manila.  \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 5 September 2014. \n5  The 1999 Policy Statement on Regional Power Trade in the Greater Mekong Subregion was signed in October \n1999 (during the Sixth Electric Power Forum meeting in Phnom Penh). \n6  ADB. 2012.

Manila (RETA 6440). \n ", "2   \ninterconnections and trading in the GMS, from October 2008 to June 2012.8  It also facilitated an \nintergovernmental memorandum of understanding (IGM) for establishing an RPCC in the GMS \ndedicated to subregional power trade, replacing current efforts that are undertaken on an ad hoc \nbasis, and constituting a major step toward realizing a GMS regional power market. The IGM \nwas signed by four GMS members during the 19th GMS Ministerial Conference in December \n2012. The Government of Myanmar signed it in June 2013 and the Government of Thailand in \nDecember 2013. GMS members also agreed, at the 11th Meeting of the RPTCC in November \n2011, to set up two working groups\u2014the WGPG and WGRI\u2014to help facilitate a GMS regional \npower market and execute the activities prescribed in the Memorandum of Understanding on \nthe Road Map for Implementing the Greater Mekong Subregion Cross-Border Power Trading. \nThe working group terms of reference were adopted at the 12th Meeting of the RPTCC in May \n2012 and their first meetings were held in June 2012. \n \n4.  The energy endowments of the GMS countries are limited and spread across the region \nwith large hydropower potential in some countries and increasing dependence on fossil fuels in \nothers. Plugging the gap between supply and demand through the development and utilization \nof additional energy resources efficiently will make electricity more affordable and the subregion \nsecured  and  self-sustainable.  Power  trade  will  enable  members  to  (i)  reduce  national \ninvestments in the power reserves maintained to meet peak demand; (ii) provide a more reliable \nsupply of electricity, including power supply from an interconnected network in case of power \nfailure; (iii) reduce operational costs; (iv) reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants; \nand (v) increase consumer access to the subregion\u2019s lowest-cost and most environmentally \nsustainable source of electricity.  \n \n5.  Confirming that the subregional power trade will develop in phases, the RPTCC will be \nsystematically  anchored  on  four  development  stages:  (i)  stage  1:  bilateral  cross-border \nconnections through power purchase agreements (PPAs); (ii) stage 2: grid-to-grid power trading \nbetween  any  pair  of  GMS  countries,  eventually  using  the  transmission  facilities  of  a  third \nregional country; (iii) stage 3: development of transmission links dedicated to cross-border \ntrading; and (iv) stage 4: involving most GMS countries, with multiple seller\u2013buyer regulatory \nframeworks, towards implementation of a wholly competitive regional market. \n \n6.  To date, the GMS power market has built on cross-border interconnections associated \nwith power exports and bilateral PPAs, as described in stage 1. This was achieved through a \ntwo-pronged approach to develop the GMS power market\u2014focusing on a policy and institutional \nframework for promoting the power trade, and physical interconnections to facilitate cross-\nborder power transmission. Before 1992, the only significant cross-border power transmission in \nthe subregion existed to export hydropower from the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao \nPDR) to Thailand. Some low-voltage lines also connected certain areas in the Lao PDR to \nThailand and separately to Cambodia, distributing power to remote border regions. By 2010, the \ntotal electricity trade in the GMS was approximately 34,139 gigawatt-hours. Thailand is the \nlargest importer at 6,938 gigawatt-hours, comprising hydropower purchases from the Lao PDR. \nMyanmar,  the  Lao  PDR,  and  the  People\u2019s  Republic  of  China  (PRC)  are  the  region\u2019s  net \nexporters, with the Lao PDR exporting the largest electricity volume and offering the most \ncompetitive supply price. Competitively-priced electricity from the PRC and Lao PDR has helped \nThailand and Viet Nam meet their large and rapidly growing demand. Likewise, Cambodia can \naccess more affordable electric power from its GMS neighbors than it can produce domestically. \n                                                \n8  ADB. 2012. Final Narrative and Financial Report on the Implementation of RETA 6440: Facilitating Regional Power \nTrading  and  Environmentally  Sustainable  Development  of  Electricity  Infrastructure  in  the  Greater  Mekong \nSubregion. Manila.  \n ", "  3 \nMoreover, remote border regions of Cambodia, the Lao PDR, and Viet Nam have benefitted \nfrom accessing cross-border power supplies based in neighboring countries. Overall, electricity \naccess has roughly doubled, from about 37% on average in 1994 to around 69% in 2009, \nmostly benefiting remote rural populations. \n \n7.  Completed power projects in the GMS with subregional impacts that were implemented \nafter 1992 with ADB assistance include the 200-megawatt capacity, 230 kilovolt transmission \nline connecting Cambodia to Viet Nam (completed in 2008), and 1,358 megawatts (total) of new \ncapacity from three hydropower plants in the Lao PDR, built primarily for electricity exports.9 The \n115 kilovolt transmission lines comprising the northwest grid of the Cambodian system and \nenabling access to more affordable power imports from Thailand was energized in 2007. A \nhydropower  plant  of  Xe  Kamen  3  in  the  Lao  PDR  that  exports  power  to  Viet  Nam  was \ncompleted in 2013. \n \n8.  To make further progress on the regional power trade and help accelerate graduation \ninto stage 2 (para. 6), GMS members should do much more to realize and share the full benefits \nof  synchronous  operations.  In  this  regard,  the  establishment  of  the  RPCC  will  tangibly \ndemonstrate the ownership and leadership by members of the regional power trade and market \ndevelopment  process.  The  institution  will  have  a  legal  identity  and  be  fully  dedicated  to \nmanaging cross-border power infrastructure and trade in the GMS. All six members of the GMS \nsigned the IGM for the establishment of the RPCC as of December 2013. A host country will be \nselected in the RPTCC meeting. Subsequently, the RPCC\u2019s articles of association should be \nfinalized for approval at the first RPCC board meeting.  \n \n9.  Regional power trade necessitates regionally integrated power systems, which require a \nhigh degree of technical compatibility, and careful system planning and operational coordination \nto minimize the threat of voltage collapse, dynamic and transient instability, or supply disruption. \nIn  the  absence  of  such  coordination  and  compatibility,  multiple  systems  across  member \ncountries may be downed by cascading outages arising from technical (or other) faults that \noriginate in a single country. The presence of varying organizational frameworks, technical \ncapabilities, and even cultural distinctions can all contribute significantly to supply interruption.10 \nThe WGPG and WGRI will help bridge gaps between GMS country technical standards and the \nregulatory  framework  to  enable  a  regional  trade  in  power  by  harmonizing  (i)  performance \nstandards  and  grid  codes  that  establish  technical  rules  for  the  coordinated  planning  and \noperation  of  the  regional  electricity  market;  and  (ii)  regulatory  frameworks,  pricing,  legal \nframeworks  for  third  party  grid  access,  and  wheeling  obligations.  These  prerequisites  are \nfundamental in the construction of a unified, fair, and transparent regional electricity market. \n \nIII.  THE POLICY AND ADVISORY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n10.  The impact of the TA will be to improve energy security through enhanced cross-border \nregional  power  trade.  The  outcome  will  be  GMS  performance  standards,  grid  codes,  and \nregulatory framework developed and harmonized at a regional level. \n \n                                                \n9  These hydropower plants are Theun-Hinboun completed in 1998, Nam Leuk in 2000, and Nam Theun 2 in 2010. \n10 ADB. 2010.

Building on the achievements and recognizing the lessons of past initiatives, the TA will \nintensify support to the GMS power systems while working more closely with GMS countries \nand development partners. This TA aims to deliver the following outputs: (i) RPCC established \nand operations commenced through continued guidance by the RPTCC; (ii) GMS performance \nstandards and grid codes considered by the WGPG; and (iii) guidelines for GMS regulatory \nframework improvement proposed by the WGRI. \n \n12.  The key activity for output 1 is continued support to RPTCC activities, including the \nestablishment and start of operations of the RPCC. The key activity for output 2 is support to \nWGPG activities, including (i) consolidating identified gaps and proposed remedies from each \nGMS member country, and making recommendations regarding an implementation plan to meet \nregional  performance  standards  and  grid  codes;  (ii)  completing  the  study  on  transmission \nregulations  and  making  recommendations  regarding  a  three-tiered  protocol  for  technical \ncoordination; and (iii) completing the study and making recommendations on standard regional \nmeeting arrangements. Output 3 includes support to WGRI activities, such as (i) providing \nstrategic guidance to WGRI in setting up a system of power trading in the GMS; (ii) completing \nand making recommendations regarding the guidelines for regulatory framework improvement \nfor midterm GMS cross-border power trading; and (iii) completing the study on, and making \nrecommendations regarding GMS transmission market and pricing mechanisms. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,800,000, of which $1,000,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) and $500,000 will be financed on \na grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty Reduction \nFund and administered by ADB.11 The six GMS governments will provide counterpart support in \nthe  form  of  counterpart  salaries,  office  space,  local  administration,  knowledge  generation, \nmonitoring and reporting services, and other in-kind contributions. The utilities in GMS member \ncountries will continue to finance their own participation in the working groups. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will be the executing agency and the Energy Division within the Southeast Asia \nDepartment will serve as the focal point, in full consultation with other divisions and departments \ninvolved  in  GMS  countries  and  related  program  activities.  The  Energy  Division  will  be \nresponsible for coordination with counterpart institutions, recruitment of consultants, preparation \nand  management  of  implementation  schedules,  and  coordination  amongst  participating \ncountries and other development partners. \n \n15.   Each  country\u2019s  chief  representative  to  the  RPTCC  will  serve  as  a  focal  point  and \ntogether with the working groups\u2019 chairs they will liaise directly with the regional TA secretariat. \nThe WGPG is chaired by Thailand and co-chaired by the PRC. The WGRI is chaired by the \nPRC and co-chaired by Viet Nam. Each working group will prepare their workplan and identify \nthe  tasks,  inputs,  and  deliverables  that  will  guide  the  implementation  of  the  regional  TA. \nCounterpart agencies will provide all necessary data, information, support, and facilitate the \nwork of the secretariat and consultants by providing in-country services for the regional TA. \n                                                \n11 The ADB Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-V) will finance outputs 1 and 3, and the PRC Regional \nCooperation and Poverty Reduction Fund will finance output 2. \n ", "  5 \n16.  The TA will require 32 person-months of international consulting inputs and 24 person-\nmonths of national consulting inputs. The outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. ADB will \nadminister the TA and recruit the consultants, manage the contract administration, and be \nresponsible for ensuring the consultants deliver the TA reports and contribute meaningfully to \nthe RPTCC and working group meetings. GMS members will actively participate by delivering \nthe studies and contributing significantly to data gathering and analysis.   \n \n17.  The consultants will be hired on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants by Asian Development Bank and its Borrowers (2013, as amended \nfrom time to time). All procurement under the regional TA will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nProcurement Guidelines (2013, as amended from time to time). All disbursements under the TA \nwill be done in accordance with ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as \namended from time to time). The TA will be implemented over a period of 36 months starting \nfrom 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017. Consulting inputs are to be delivered on an \nintermittent basis. \n \n18.  Monitoring, consultation, and reporting will be done through the regular meetings of the \nRPTCC, working groups, and eventually the RPCC. Progress and agreements will be recorded \nin  official  documentation  including  summaries  of  proceedings.  Technical  study  reports  will \nlikewise be available for progress monitoring and to inform on collaboration between GMS \nmembers and adaptive management in project implementation. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n19.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $500,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the People\u2019s Republic of China Regional Cooperation and Poverty \nReduction Fund; and (ii) ADB providing the balance not exceeding the equivalent of $1,000,000 \non a grant basis for Harmonizing the Greater Mekong Subregion Power Systems to Facilitate \nRegional Power Trade, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n \n \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  Assumptions and Risks  \nImpact  By 2022    Assumption \nImproved energy  Power traded among GMS  Power trade  GMS member countries \nsecurity through  countries: 70,000 gigawatt- agreements  remain politically committed \nenhanced cross- hours (baseline: 34,139  to regional energy \nborder regional  gigawatt-hours in 2010)   cooperation and the vision of \npower trade    power trading in a full-fledged \n    regional power market \n       \nOutcome  By 2017    Assumption \nGMS performance  A standing institution  Various technical  GMS member countries \nstandards, grid  dedicated to GMS power trade  study reports and  remain committed to new \ncodes, and  and managing cross-border  resulting  institutional and legal \nregulatory  power infrastructure  recommendations  arrangements for the energy \nframework  operationalized    sector. \ndeveloped and    Meeting minutes of   \nharmonized at a  Milestones set on performance  RPTCC and  Risk \nregional level   standards and grid codes,  working groups  Disparities between GMS \n  transmission regulations, and  country member economies \na regulatory framework  and capacities may lead to \ndelivered in the Memorandum  inconsistent advantages and \nof Understanding on the Road  disadvantages assessed \nMap for Implementing the  among and between \nGreater Mekong Subregion  members that could constrain \nCross-Border Power Trading   or compromise \nharmonization. \nOutputs  By 2017    Assumption \n1.

Finally, for output 3, there may be a risk that GMS members will have difficulty in agreeing to a regional \nmarket design and structure, but this will be mitigated by obtaining administrative and technical expertise to help manage \nthe issues.  \nb  Stage 2 of regional power trade development is when trading is possible between any pair of GMS countries, eventually \nusing transmission facilities of a third regional country, but constrained by available cross-border capacity (i.e., limited to \nthe surplus capacity of lines linked to power purchase agreements). \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n ", "8  Appendix 2 \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \nItem  Amount \nA.
