INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The Operations Evaluation Department (OED) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) \nevaluates  independently  the  effectiveness  of  ADB's  operations  for  development.  OED's \nfunctions are to (i) assess the performance of completed projects and programs; (ii) review and \nvalidate  self-evaluation  activities  of  operational  departments;  (iii) provide  feedback  for  the \ndesign and review of strategies, policies, and operations; (iv) monitor and report on responses \nof ADB departments and executing agencies to evaluation findings and recommendations; (v) \nbuild  evaluation  capacity  in  developing  member  countries  (DMCs);  and  (vi)  harmonize \nevaluation practices and share evaluation experience with other multilateral development banks \n(MDBs) through the Evaluation Cooperation Group (ECG).1 Lately, OED has increased the \nnumber  of  broad  evaluations  of  groups  of  sector  or  country  operations  and  institutional \ndevelopment issues, themes, approaches, and policies.2 Topics are selected in consultation \nwith the ADB Board of Directors' Development Effectiveness Committee (DEC), former DEC \nmembers, Management, and operations departments.3 DEC, which provides overall guidance to \nOED, approved the latter's work program for 2007\u20132009 in November 2006. \n \n2.  In 2007\u20132009, OED will (i) undertake fewer evaluations of individual operations but will \nvalidate ratings in all project completion reports; (ii) increase the number of broad evaluations \nsuch as corporate and policy evaluations, country and sector assistance evaluations, thematic \nevaluations, and impact evaluations; (iii) improve the evaluative content of OED annual reports \non portfolio management and evaluation results; (iv) prepare or revise evaluation guidelines; (v) \nsequence evaluations so that those done early in the 3-year period feed those planned for later \nyears;  and  (vi)  promote  knowledge  management,  including  dissemination  of  findings  and \nrecommendations in accessible and digestible ways. The evaluation work program for 2007\u2013\n2009 is in Appendix 1. In 2007, it includes (i) one sector assistance program evaluation (SAPE) \nand 10 special evaluation studies (SESs), (ii) 10 selected individual performance evaluations of \ncompleted ADB-assisted operations in the public sector and 3 in the private sector, (iii) one real-\ntime evaluation of the design and monitoring framework, and (iv) 3 recurring outputs of OED. \nOED will intensify ADB's contributions to the activities of the ECG. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Given ADB's country focus, country-level evaluations are important. As reported in the \n2006 Annual Evaluation Review, country assistance program evaluations (CAPEs) influence the \nformulation of country partnership strategies (CPSs). CAPEs evaluate the CPSs, analyzing the \ndevelopment impact of ADB's assistance over a decade or more, and making recommendations \non ADB's activities, including the sector mix and use of assistance modalities. In 2006, DEC \ntook steps to ensure that its findings and recommendations are taken into account. SAPEs \nassess  the  relevance,  effectiveness,  and  sustainability  of  ADB's  assistance  to  a  sector's \ndevelopment  and  financial  performance,  as  well  as  impact  on  economic  development  and \npoverty reduction. SAPEs are programmed to feed into the corresponding CAPEs. SESs focus \non selected thematic issues across sectors or countries, or evaluate an ADB policy or process. \n \n                                                 \n1  The ECG was established in 1995 to foster collaboration and harmonization of evaluation work among the \nevaluation units of MDBs. ADB chaired the ECG from 1 June 2005 to 31 May 2006. \n2  The  types  of  evaluation  reports  include  project/program  performance  evaluation  reports,  assessments  of \ndevelopment  impact,  special  evaluation  studies,  impact  evaluation  studies,  country  assistance  program \nevaluations, and annual evaluation reports. \n3  OED's work program is available at http://www.adb.org/Evaluation/work_prog.asp \n ", "                   \n2     \n4.  Of the 15 studies, 7 will be delivered in 2007. Work on others will begin in 2007 and end \nin  2008.  Advance  work  toward  the  2008  work  program  may  also  begin  in  2007.  Broad \nevaluations  and  other  elements  of  the  evaluation  work  program  are  complex  and  require \nconsulting and other services to complement OED's inputs. They have historically been funded \nprimarily  through  technical  assistance  (TA).  Other  components  of  OED's  work  program, \nincluding the preparation of project or program performance evaluation reports, have been \nfunded from ADB's budget. This pattern of resource use will continue in 2007. An allocation of \n$1.485 million for the TA is included in the indicative planning figures for 2007.4\n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n5.  The impact of the TA5 will be improved effectiveness of ADB for development. The \noutcome will be useful and practical findings and recommendations to support the formulation \nand implementation of new CPSs, sector strategies, policies, and operations. The design and \nmonitoring framework is in Appendix 2. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n6.  For each evaluation, a paper on the evaluation approach will specify the background, \nrationale, purpose, scope, research questions, and resource requirements. The views of ADB \nstaff  and  government  agencies  will  be  sought  and  reflected  as  appropriate.  Existing  ADB \nknowledge products and services will be sought and leveraged. From 2007, each paper will \ncontain  a  dissemination  plan  to  build  meaning  and  understanding,  develop  support,  and \ngenerate  learning  opportunities.  Evaluation  reports  will  include  a  bibliography  of  reviewed \nknowledge products and services as a quality check. The following key activities are envisaged. \n \n7.  SES  on  Achievements  of  ADB's  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework,  2001\u20132015. \nADB's  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework  (LTSF),  2001\u20132015,  moves  the  poverty  reduction \nagenda  forward  over  15  years.  Three  medium-term  strategies  (MTS)  will  be  required  to \nimplement  the  LTSF.  MTS-I  (2001\u20132005)  defined  operational  priorities  for  medium-term \nchallenges and identified the organizational and other changes needed to address them. In \n2007,  the  LTSF  will  be  reviewed  by  the  Strategy  and  Policy  Department  (SPD)  against \nemerging challenges, opportunities, and risks. An important input will be a forward-looking \nstrategic  report  prepared  by  an  independent  panel  of  eminent  persons.  The  SES  will \ncomplement the work of SPD and the panel by identifying lessons from operations implemented \nunder MTS-I and (i) take stock of relevant literature, ADB documents, and ongoing or planned \nstudies; (ii) review and assess the achievements of MTS-I, and recent initiatives relating to the \nLTSF; and (iii) formulate options for addressing the findings and recommendations. The breadth \nof OED's work will be limited by the tight schedule for the overall review of the LTSF.  \n \n8.  SES on ADF VIII and IX Replenishments. The Asian Development Fund (ADF) is \nADB's main concessionary financing mechanism. Its effectiveness can be assessed by studying \nresource  allocation  and  changes  over  the  years  and  the  performance  of  ADF  projects, \nparticularly those funded under ADF VIII (2001\u20132004). If a sufficient sample of completed ADF \nVIII projects is not available, the SES  may also draw on the performance of  earlier ADF \nprojects. Projects funded under ADF IX (2005\u20132008) are at the early stages of their cycles and \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006. Budget of the Asian Development Bank for 2007. Manila. \n5  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 25 November 2006. ", "3 \nno  meaningful  assessment  can  be  made  of  their  performance.  Notwithstanding,  some \noperational  aspects  could  be  examined.  The  SES  will  examine  outcomes  to  help  answer \nquestions as to what works and what does not. It will evaluate (i) initial experiences under ADF \nIX, (ii) the role and effectiveness of ADB's operations in weakly performing states (and perhaps \nin the Pacific), (iii) improvements in project preparation (quality at entry), (iv) effectiveness of \nperformance-based  allocation  of  ADF  resources,  and  (v)  effectiveness  of  direct  poverty \ninterventions. The SES will use a combination of desk study, macroeconomic analysis, selected \ncase  studies  in  recipient  DMCs,  and  discussions  with  stakeholders.  Findings  and \nrecommendations will be made available in time to support the work that SPD will undertake in \nparallel related to ADF replenishment. \n \n9.  SES on Linking Quality at Entry and the Project Cycle. Investment projects and \nprograms are among the main products of ADB and continuous efforts to improve their quality \nare necessary. The SES will focus on the mechanics of ensuring quality at entry under current \nbusiness practices. It will provide a window on (i) factors that limit the effectiveness of ADB's \nproject preparatory TA supervision and loan processing system, (ii) the efficacy of business \npractices in screening proposals and incorporating the lessons of experience in these, and (iii) \nsimple measures that can be taken to raise the effectiveness and efficiency of staff responsible \nfor quality at entry. The SES will be conducted through research at ADB headquarters and field \nstudies in selected ADB Resident Missions (RMs) and DMCs. \n \n10.  SES  on  ADB's  Operations  in  Support  of  Law  and  Justice  Reform.  ADB's \nGovernance: Sound Development Management (1997) identifies the elements of governance to \nbe accountability, participation, predictability, and transparency. ADB's policy on Anticorruption \n(1998,  as  amended  to  date)  refined  issues  associated  with  corruption  identified  in  the \ngovernance  policy.  ADB  has  provided  over  400  advisory  and  regional  TAs  to  strengthen \ngovernance.  Some  loan  and  grant  projects  have  had  related  components.  The  Access  to \nJustice Program in Pakistan, approved for $350 million in 2001, was the first related loan from \nany MDB. The SES will (i) assess the impact of ADB's law and justice priorities and investments \nat the country partnership and medium-term strategy levels; (ii) evaluate the impact of law and \njustice reform initiatives on fostering governance, strengthening the environment for economic \ngrowth, promoting legal empowerment, access to justice, and regional cooperation; and (iii) \nmark out appropriate institutional and financing modalities at country and regional levels. \n \n11.  SES on the Effectiveness of ADB's Resident Missions. Pursuant to the Resident \nMission Policy (2000), the number of RMs grew from 13 in 2000 to 23 in 2006. RMs have also \nbeen given greater responsibility and authority to undertake their work. Some RMs play a role in \nresponding  to  emergency  situations.  Others  have  helped  establish  and  operate  extended \nmissions. Meanwhile, the challenges faced by ADB and DMCs have evolved. They are reflected \nin (i) the greater attention given to middle-income countries, (ii) an increasing demand for ADB's \nprivate  sector  operations,  (iii)  stronger  support  for  disaster  management  and  postconflict \nmanagement, (iv) the priorities of MTS-II (2006\u20132008), and (v) ADB's comparative advantage \nvis-\u00e0-vis other MDBs. Recent evaluation reports have suggested that (i) an adequate number of \nstaff should be stationed in RMs to cover the areas selected in CPSs, (ii) institutional flexibility is \nneeded to reduce staff in areas that are not selected as priorities in CPSs, and (iii) more \nexperienced staff should be posted to RMs. The SES will evaluate the accomplishments of RMs \nand make recommendations for improvement. It will feed the work that SPD and the Budget, \nPersonnel, and Management Systems Department are undertaking to review the policy. \n \n12.  SES on Private Sector Regional Funds. ADB initiated investment funds operations \n(IFOs) in 1983. As of 31 December 2006, they accounted for 12% of ADB's Private Sector ", "                   \n4     \nOperations Department's portfolio. IFOs fall into four categories: infrastructure funds, venture \ncapital funds, portfolio investment funds, and special purpose funds. They focus on regions, \ncountries, or individual sectors. Historically, ADB has supported IFOs to mobilize private capital \nto support the development of infrastructure and small and medium-sized enterprises and to \nencourage  infrastructure  capital  markets.  The  SES  will  (i)  examine  the  success  of  ADB's \ninvestments in terms of achieving development objectives and profitability, and (ii) review ADB's \nfund management operations to identify ways to strengthen their management. \n \n13.  SES on Infrastructure Development and Trade in Central Asia. The Central Asia \nRegional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Program was initiated in 1997. CAREC's goal is to \nimprove living standards and to reduce poverty in CAREC countries through more efficient and \neffective  regional  economic  cooperation.  To  date,  the  Program  has  financed  infrastructure \nprojects and improved the region's policy environment in the areas of transport, energy, trade \npolicy,  and  trade  facilitation.  The  SES  will  (i)  evaluate  ADB's  performance  in  relation  to \nCAREC's goal and ADB's mandate and strategy for subregional cooperation; (ii) contribute to \nthe making of strategic choices and setting of priorities in the formulation of the new CAREC \nregional country strategy and program in 2008, and (iii) to assess the quality of the past regional \nstrategy and its preparation, the link between the strategy and associated operational programs, \nand  coordination  and  cooperation  with  development  partners.  It  will  reflect  the  views  of \nstakeholders on the processes involved and assess the performance of selected interventions. \n \n14.  SES  on  the  Effectiveness  of  ADB's  Operations  in  Support  of  Capacity \nDevelopment. The Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness called for capacity building to be an \nexplicit objective of national development and poverty reduction strategies. The SES will (i) \ndevelop an evaluation methodology for assessing the performance of ADB's assistance for \ncapacity development; (ii) evaluate the performance of ADB's assistance in priority sectors \nidentified as Group I in MTS-II (2006\u20132008) in three countries, viz., Cambodia, Nepal, and \nPhilippines; (iii) identify the quality-at-entry and implementation factors within and beyond ADB's \ncontrol that affect the success and failure of ADB's assistance for capacity development; and \n(iv)  draw  lessons  for  improving  the  performance  of  ADB's  future  assistance  for  capacity \ndevelopment. Findings and recommendations will feed the 2007 Annual Evaluation Review. \n \n15.  SES  on  Special  Purpose  Funds  (Non-Japanese).  OED  is  evaluating  the  Japan \nSpecial Purpose Fund, the Japan Fund for Poverty Reduction, and the Japan Scholarship \nProgram.  Besides  these,  ADB  administers  28  trust  funds  with  a  commitment  of  just  over \n$1 billion. Although more than half of the funds are bilateral, multifunding agency trust funds \naccount for almost 80% of the total, of which the two biggest are the Asian Tsunami Fund \n(around  60%  of  the  total)  and  the  Pakistan  Earthquake  Fund  (8.4%  of  the  total).  Other \nsignificant funds are (i) the Cooperation Fund for Technical Assistance with the Government of \nthe United Kingdom and Northern Ireland amounting to $85.0 million (or 8.4% of the total), and \n(ii) the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund amounting to $55.0 million (or 5.4% of the total). \nOthers cover e-knowledge, climate change, managing for development results, governance, the \nwater sector, gender and development, poverty and environment, and HIV/AIDS. The criteria for \nincluding funds in the SES are not yet developed. \n \n16.  SAPE in Bangladesh. In 1996\u20132006, ADB provided 42 loans amounting to $3.35 billion \nto  Bangladesh,  accompanied  by  120  TAs  for  $64.54  million.  The  sectors  included  energy \n(32.2%), transport and communications (21.7%), multisector (14.8%), agriculture and natural \nresources  (12.2%),  and  education  (11.8%).  OED  will  participate  with  the  Department  for \nInternational  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Japan  Bank  for  International \nCooperation, and the World Bank in a joint evaluation of overseas development assistance to ", "5 \nBangladesh. The sector that OED will cover will be determined jointly. Specifically, the SAPE \nwill (i) provide a comprehensive assessment of impacts of the assistance of ADB and other \nfunding agencies, on an aggregate basis, in the designated sector; (ii) identify lessons from the \npast 20 years; and (iii) distinguish challenges facing the sector and strategies for the future. \n \n17.  CAPE Updates and CPS Completion Report Validations. A new knowledge product, \nthe CAPE update, will be presented in 2007 because (i) CPS completion reports are being \nprepared, which will provide a better basis for preparation of CAPEs; (ii) some country portfolios \nare relatively small, and do not merit the depth of analysis of past CAPEs; and (iii) OED will \nundertake second CAPEs for several countries. In the main, CAPE updates will be conducted in \ncountries with small portfolios for which production of a full CAPE would not be an efficient use \nof resources. OED will prepare CAPE updates for Mongolia and the Philippines to support the \npreparation of new CPSs. It is also piloting a CPS completion report validation in the Maldives. \n \n18.  Support  to  ECG.6  OED  contributes  to  the  work  of  the  ECG.  It  (i)  takes  part  in \nbenchmarking studies, e.g., for public sector investments and other modalities for which good \npractice  standards  are  available;  (ii)  develops  good-practice  standards  to  promote \nharmonization; (iii) helps build the ECG database; and (iv) undertakes joint papers that draw \ntogether the evaluation functions of ECG members. Such work is cofinanced by ECG members. \n \n19.  Knowledge Management. Evaluation reports that are placed on a shelf provide no \nreturn on investment. The highest value will be realized when what is learned impacts decision \nmaking and improves practice. The TA will support use of knowledge management tools in OED \nand its interfaces with other departments, DMCs, and the international evaluation community. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n20.  The TA is estimated to cost $1.485 million. It will be financed on a grant basis from \nADB's TA funding program. Details of the cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n21.  OED will implement the TA and supervise the preparation of reports for each evaluation. \nBased on experience with similar studies in the past, about 55 person-months of international \nand about 60 person-months of national consulting services will be required. Outline terms of \nreference are in Appendix 4. Detailed terms of reference will be developed in the proposed \nevaluation approach papers before action is taken to engage consultants. Consultants will be \nengaged according to ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from \ntime to time) and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging national consultants. The \nTA  will  start  in  April  2007  and  will  be  completed  in  December  2009.  Implementation \narrangements will be flexible enough to allow changes should OED's work program be altered. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n \n22.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,485,000 on a grant basis for Selected Evaluation Studies for \n2007. \n                                                 \n6  The members of the ECG are the African Development Bank, ADB, the European Bank for Reconstruction and \nDevelopment, the European Investment Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the International Monetary \nFund, and the World Bank Group.
