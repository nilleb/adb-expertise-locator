INTRODUCTION \n1.  Two key findings of the 2005 Country Poverty Assessment for Indonesia are that (i) \nimproved quality social services and infrastructure access is central to poverty reduction and \nachievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), but that (ii) the population remains \nhighly vulnerable to shocks.1 Poverty reduction is a major concern of the Government of the \nRepublic of Indonesia, which has incorporated the national poverty reduction strategy paper \n(PRSP)  in  its  Medium-Term  Development  Plan  (MTDP)  2005\u20132009.  The  Government  has \nrequested Asian Development Bank (ADB) support for developing local government-level poverty \nreduction strategies linked to pro-poor resource allocation, and for designing social assistance \nprograms to mitigate the impact of shocks on the poor. Reconnaissance missions took place in \nFebruary and April 2005 to identify broad issues. Staff undertook fact-finding in July 2005, with \nfollow-up in August and October 2005, to reach broad understanding with the Government on the \nproject's design and scope. The impact, outcomes, and outputs of the technical assistance (TA) \nare summarized in the design and monitoring framework (Appendix 1).2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The  National  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  Paper.  The  Government  finalized  and \npublished the PRSP in September 2005, but a prior draft version was incorporated in the MTDP in \nJanuary 2005.  Poverty reduction is conceptualized in terms of fulfilling 10 basic rights: the right to \nfood, health, education, employment, housing, clean water, land, natural resources and a clean \nenvironment, security, and participation.  The 10 basic rights are reflected in 10 targets, and it is \nevident from the list that service delivery is key to achieving them. The Government's challenge \nnow is how to operationalize the PRSP in the context of decentralization. This task forms the core \nof the work program of the National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) Deputy Minister \nfor Poverty Reduction, a position created in September 2005, underscoring the Government's \ncommitment to addressing these issues.  \n \n3.  Decentralization  and  Poverty  Reduction.  Indonesia  embarked  on  an  ambitious \ndecentralization  program  in  January  2001.  Vast  responsibilities  were  devolved  to  the  local \ngovernments, now comprising 32 provinces and some 440 districts and cities. Decentralization \nwas carried out with a \u201cbig bang,\u201d often without adequate preparation or capacity development at \neither the local or central level and many gaps remain. The country governance assessment \nshows  considerable  variation  across  provinces  and  districts  in  their  capacity  to  implement \ndecentralized responsibilities, and a discrepancy between the standards for public services and \nthe  resources  allocated  to  them.3  One  of  the  objectives  of  decentralization  is  for  local \ngovernments to become more responsive to the needs of their constituents. In Indonesia this goal \nis hampered by a number of constraints. At the local government level, the capacity to implement \nnew responsibilities is often low. Furthermore, local responsibilities are not always clear.   \n \n4.  The  process  of  decentralization  has  the  potential  to  greatly  improve  welfare  through \nprompt service delivery to the people, especially the poor. In October 2002 the interministerial \nPoverty Reduction Committee (KPK) circulated an instruction to all subnational governments to \nestablish local poverty reduction committees (KPKD).4 The instruction stipulated that each KPKD \nshould develop a local poverty reduction strategy (SPKD), but it lacked clear guidance on what a \npoverty reduction strategy is, why it is important, and how to go about preparing one. As a result, \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005. From Poverty to Prosperity: A Country Poverty Assessment for Indonesia (draft). Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 3 August 2005. \n3  ADB. 2004. Country Governance Assessment Report, Indonesia. Manila. \n4  Ministry of Home Affairs (MOHA) letter no. 412.6/2489/SJ. 30 October 2002. \n ", " 2   \nthe directive is being implemented in some districts but not in others, and the quality of the SPKDs \nvaries dramatically. As of May 2005, 316 of some 440 districts had established a KPKD, but only \n99 of those had prepared an SPKD.  Only 14 of 32 provinces had prepared a provincial SPKD.    \n \n5.  Pro-Poor and Participatory Budgets.  While most local governments in Indonesia are \ncommitted to improving service delivery, there remains a gap between such statements and the \nway in which local governments plan, raise, and spend their resources. Budgets are the central \ntool for planning and managing resources.  Integrating a pro-poor, participatory perspective can \nhave profound implications for service delivery and poverty reduction outcomes. The requirement \nto produce an SPKD provides an opportunity for districts and provinces to ensure that budgets \nfund investments with poverty-reducing outcomes. It supports the MTDP 2004\u20132009 call \"to \nmainstream poverty reduction efforts in the national economic agenda.\"  Experiences in Brazil, \nSouth  Africa,  and  elsewhere  demonstrate  that  budgets  based  on  increased  participation, \ntransparency,  and  accountability  have  real  development  results.5  Indonesia  has  begun  to \nintroduce participatory planning at various local levels through the musrenbang6 process, but the \nmeetings focus more on local leaders' priorities than on enabling debate between community \nmembers and local governments. It is important to be realistic; when project affordability is not \ntaken into account, the process results in little more than unrealistic, unfunded wish lists. SPKDs \nshould be seen as action plans that are guided by national-level and provincial-level strategies, \nand budgets are a way to operationalize the plans.   \n   \n6.  Socialization of poverty and service delivery issues and broad participation in the SPKD \nand  budget  processes  are  key.  Women's  participation  in  budget  planning  and  negotiating \nprocesses, often lacking, should be particularly encouraged.7 Local communities tend to lack \ninformation about development plans, budget allocations, and their entitlement to social services. \nA 2004 survey revealed that three quarters of poor respondents were unaware that there were \nchannels for expressing concerns regarding service delivery.8 Local governments in turn should \nhave access to examples of best practices in pro-poor service delivery, so as to learn from \nexperiences elsewhere.9 Local governments also require citizen feedback mechanisms to assess \ntheir performance and to refine their targeting methods.  \n \n7.  Social Safety Nets.  While local planning and pro-poor budgeting are key steps for \npoverty reduction, national-level support for poverty reduction is also required. The Government \nrecognizes that a large segment of the population remains vulnerable to shocks of all kinds, and \nparticularly to price shocks. Anticipating that the October 2005 removal of fuel subsidies and \nsubsequent  price  increases  would  have  a  major  impact  on  lower  income  households,  the \nGovernment rapidly designed and implemented a short-term unconditional cash transfer program \nfor 15.5 million poor and near-poor households. It now seeks assistance in designing a medium-\nterm conditional cash transfer (CCT) program. CCTs are an innovative form of social assistance \nthat provides money to poor families contingent upon certain behavior, usually investments in \nhuman capital (such as sending children to school or regular visits to health centers). CCT \n                                                 \n5  See papers and case study materials prepared for the ADB/IADB conference on Citizen Participation in the Context \nof Fiscal Decentralization: Best Practices in Municipal Management in Latin America and Asia. Kobe, Japan. \nSeptember 2002. \n6  Musyawarah Perencanaan Pembangunan (Development Planning Meeting).   \n7 The TA will incorporate lessons from ongoing TA 4479-INO (ADB. 2004. Gender Responsive Public Policy and \nAdministration. Manila).   \n8 The governance and decentralization survey (undertaken in 32 districts of 8 provinces) is part of the Indonesian \nDecentralization Empirical Analysis (IDEA) Project, conducted by the World Bank together with the Centre for Public \nand Policy Studies at Gajah Mada University (see www.gdsonline.org). \n9 The lessons from RETA 6072 (ADB. 2002. Good Practice on Pro-Poor Service Delivery by Local Governments. \nManila) will be brought to bear here. ", "      3\nprograms  have  dual  objectives\u2014immediate  income  support  coupled  with  longer-term \naccumulation of human capital\u2014and serve as a demand-side complement to the supply of health \nand education services. There is clear evidence of success from CCT programs in Latin America, \nwhere implementation has been centralized, bypassing local governments.10  How to design and \nimplement an effective and efficient program in decentralized Indonesia will be a significant \ncomponent of this TA. \n  \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The  TA  impact  will  be  improved  access  of  the  poor  to  quality  social  services  and \ninfrastructure in decentralized Indonesia. The outcomes are (i) local poverty reduction strategies \nthat  are  operationalized,  linked  to  a  pro-poor  and  participatory  budget  process,  and \ninstitutionalized in pilot districts; and (ii) a nationwide CCT program that provides income support \nto the poor while building human capital. The TA will build on lessons learned in work done to \ndate, such as under the TA for Managing Regional Disparity in Economic and Poverty Reduction \nPrograms under Decentralization,11 and will closely coordinate with ongoing initiatives of ADB, \nincluding the planned Community and Local Government Services (CLGS) II. Other relevant \nactivities include two regional TA projects: Institutionalizing Civil-Society Participation to Create \nLocal Pro-Poor Budgets,12 and Decentralization in Social Sectors.13 The TA will also liaise closely \nwith  other  development  partners,  particularly  through  the  Decentralization  Support  Facility \n(DSF).14   \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities  \n9.  The  TA  will  have  four  outputs:  (i)  SPKD  development;  (ii)  pro-poor  budgeting;  (iii) \nInstitutional development for poverty reduction, and (iv) design and implementation of a national \nCCT program. The first two components are designed both to build on and to complement one \nanother, and will be sequenced to allow lead time as well as overlap.  They will be on a pilot basis \nin at least 12 district governments in two provinces. Lessons from the pilots will be disseminated \nwidely. The district selection method will be developed at TA inception, considering (i) districts \ntargeted for assistance under other ADB initiatives, (ii) a mix of districts that demonstrate strong \ncommitment and some that have weaker capacity, (iii) clustering, and (iv) Government priorities. \nThe guiding principle will be to maximize synergies and avoid duplication with ADB and other \ndevelopment partners' initiatives.  \n \n                                                 \n10 Morley and Coady. 2003.

This  list  is  not \nexhaustive, and a stocktaking exercise will be part of the TA inception period. \n14 DSF is a multidonor initiative of Department for International Development (United Kingdom), World Bank, ADB, and \nothers to promote aid coordination and harmonization in activities related to decentralization.  \n ", " 4   \n10.  Component 1: SPKD Development. Indonesia's local governments are instructed to \nproduce local poverty reduction strategies. The TA will develop a capacity development program \nto assist at least 12 local governments to produce a useful SPKD that informs resource planning \nand allocation. Activities will be undertaken in accordance with the KPK instructions and will \ninclude (i) detailed poverty analysis and mapping of the extent of deprivation, service levels and \nshortfalls, incomes, access, employment, and so on; (ii) consultations with the poor to prioritize \nlocal needs by geographic area, by sector, by sex, by social group, and so on; and (iii) training of \ntrainers and on-the-job capacity development to allow for the annual preparation of SPKD in the \nfuture. Based on the pilot activities, this component will develop detailed guidance manuals, \nchecklists,  and  useful  tools  to  support  other  local  governments  in  the  SPKD  preparation \nprocess.15  \n \n11.  Component  2:  Pro-Poor  Budgeting.    This  component  will  operationalize  the  SPKD \nprepared for each pilot district by developing mechanisms to link it to the budget. The TA team will \nfirst define the scope and process for pro-poor budgeting\u2014the likely financial space for such \nactivity in regional (provincial/district/city) governments, and any potential central government \ncontributions. The work program will include (i) reviewing the legal and regulatory framework for \nplanning and budgeting at the local government level, (ii) assessing the financial implications of \nthe needs identified in the SPKD (taking into consideration minimum service standards and \ntargeting mechanisms), (iii) deriving options for improved service delivery, (iv) designing and \nimplementing training for consultative and participatory budget processes that involve men and \nwomen,  (v)  institutionalizing  the  participatory  processes  (e.g.,  developing  local  pro-poor \nregulations),  and  (vi)  obtaining  legislative  endorsement  of  the  results  of  the  process.    The \nemphasis in component 2 will be on enhancing the interface between district, provincial, and \nnational governments.  As in component 1, activities in the pilot districts will result in guidance \nmanuals, tool kits, etc. \n \n12.  Component 3: Institutional Development for Poverty Reduction. To support the other \nTA components, the TA team will implement a program of institutional development and advisory \nwork under two broad themes: (i) operationalizing the national poverty reduction strategy, and (ii) \nbest  practices  in  pro-poor  service  delivery.  Theme  (i)  will  support  the  work  program  of  the \nBAPPENAS Deputy Minister for Poverty Reduction.  Theme (ii) will examine best practices in pro-\npoor service delivery, with both international and Indonesian case studies and lessons learned. \nThis  component  will  also  involve  designing  and  piloting  methods  for  citizen  feedback  and \nmonitoring of service delivery (such as report cards) in the 12 districts of components 1 and 2. \nFindings in component 3 will be distilled in a series of seminars and workshops, and publications \nand tool kits for wide dissemination and replication.  \n \n13.  Component 4: Designing a CCT program. The TA team will work with the BAPPENAS \nDeputy Minister for Poverty Reduction to design options for a comprehensive, efficient, and \neffective CCT program to cushion the impact of fuel price increases on the ultrapoor, the poor, \nand  the  near-poor.  Component  4  will  begin  with  an  in-depth  review  and  evaluation  of  (i) \nIndonesia's unconditional cash transfer program (launched in October 2005);16 (ii) CCT programs \nin other countries, with a focus on the Latin American experience and their built-in monitoring and \nevaluation mechanisms; and (iii) Indonesia's past social assistance programs. Targeting and \ndelivery should be particularly emphasized. The review will inform new program design options for \npossible implementation on a pilot basis. The design options will consider the replicability of CCT \n                                                 \n15 Coordination with United Nations Development Programme, World Bank, and the Government\u2019s initiatives is key. \n16 Unconditional cash transfers are distributed to the poor with no attached conditionality: 15.5 million poor and near-\npoor households are now receiving quarterly payments of Rp300,000 through the post office.  ", "      5\nprogram  successes  under  different  conditions\u2014particularly  in  the  Indonesian  context  of \ndecentralization. \n  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total TA cost is estimated at $2,625,000 equivalent, comprising $1,285,000 in foreign \nexchange and $1,340,000 in local currency.  The TA will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTA funding program ($1,800,000) with cofinancing from the Government of the United Kingdom \n(DFID)  in  the  amount  of  $300,000,  administered  by  ADB.  The  Government  will  contribute \n$525,000  equivalent  to  fund  counterpart  staff  salaries  and  travel,  office  facilities,  and \nadministrative services.  Detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be the Deputy Minister for Poverty Reduction, \nBAPPENAS, working closely with the Deputy for the Coordination of Poverty Reduction of the \nMenkokesra. A project management unit will be established within BAPPENAS. The TA steering \ncommittee will comprise officials from BAPPENAS, Menkokesra, KPK, Ministry of Home Affairs, \nand Ministry of Finance. Inclusion of representatives from the Central Bureau of Statistics (BPS) \nand from associations of regional governments is also encouraged.  The steering committee will \nmeet regularly to guide TA implementation. The consultants will coordinate closely with the efforts \nof other development partners, particularly in CCT issues.  \n \n16.  ADB will use the full technical proposal and quality-based selection to engage a firm (or \nconsortium) of international and domestic consultants in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements  satisfactory  to  ADB  for  engaging  domestic \nconsultants. A total of 48 person-months of international and 96 person-months of domestic \nconsulting services are anticipated to be required to implement the TA. Draft outline terms of \nreference (TOR) for the consultants are in Appendix 3.  The work is expected to start in March \n2006  and  continue  for  18  months.    The  TORs  will  be  fine-tuned  during  TA  inception.  The \nconsultants will submit an inception report by the end of month 1, outlining a clear work program \nand schedule of the deliverables for the TA. The consultants will submit a midterm report by the \nend of month 9, a draft final report by the beginning of month 18, and a final report by the end of \nMonth 18. All major reports will be produced and disseminated in both Bahasa Indonesia and \nEnglish. The TA will implement comprehensive dissemination and outreach activities, including \nworkshops and seminars, tool kits, manuals, and other publications. The TA will explore electronic \nmeans of dissemination, possibly through existing websites, and will contribute to sustainable \ncapacity building through training of trainers who will serve as resource persons once the TA is \ncompleted.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION AND DECISION \n17.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \n(TA) not exceeding the equivalent of $1,800,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Indonesia \nfor Pro-Poor Planning and Budgeting. If the Board approves ADB providing the TA, the President, \nacting under the authority delegated by the Board, will approve ADB administering the balance of \nthe  TA  not  exceeding  the  equivalent  of  $300,000  to  be  financed  on  a  grant  basis  by  the \nGovernment of the United Kingdom for Pro-Poor Planning and Budgeting, and hereby reports this \naction to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumption \nImproved access of the  There are improved MDG  Annual socioeconomic  Central and local \npoor to key social  indicators in health,  surveys, including the  governments remain \nservices and small-scale  education, and water and  SUSENAS.  fully committed to \ninfrastructure in  sanitation, and in  poverty reduction, and \nRegular MDG reports \ndecentralized Indonesia  women\u2019s empowerment.  pro-poor budgeting \nprepared by the \nmethods are rolled out \n  Government \nto all local governments. \nOutcomes      Assumptions \n(i) Local poverty  (i) An Administrative  National government  National Government \nreduction strategies are  Order issued,  budget documents   commitment to a \noperationalized, linked to  encouraging local  participatory resource \nRecord of Government \na pro-poor, gender- governments to adopt a  allocation process \nadministrative orders \nsensitive and  pro-poor and gender  continues. \nparticipatory budget  sensitive planning and  Local government budget \nThe LGFGR-SDP \nprocess, and  budgeting process.  documents \nproject supports and \ninstitutionalized in \nselected districts.

The technical assistance (TA) will have four components: (i) support for local poverty \nreduction  strategies;  (ii)  support  for  pro-poor  budgeting;  (iii)  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building with two main themes (poverty reduction strategies, and improving service \ndelivery); and (iv) development of a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program. Work will be \nundertaken at all levels of government (national, provincial, district) and special emphasis will be \ngiven  to  enhancing  the  interface  between  various  levels  of  government.  Work  with  local \nresearch institutes, think tanks, and civil society is strongly encouraged.  \n \nB.  Staffing \n \n2.  A  consulting  firm  will  provide  at  least  48  person-months  of  international  consulting \nservices.  All international consultants will have relevant regional experience (particularly in \nworking with local governments in a decentralized context) and a working command of Bahasa \nIndonesia. The team (person-months are in parenthesis) will comprise a poverty reduction \nspecialist/team leader (15), a pro-poor budgeting advisor (14), a social safety nets specialist (8), \na local government capacity development expert (6), and an institutional development specialist \n(5).    \n \n3.  The consulting firm will further provide at least 96 person-months of domestic expert \ninputs, with a local government budgeting expert/deputy team leader engaged for the duration \nof the TA (18).  All experts will have broad practical experience, drawn from the fields of poverty \nreduction  planning,  social  assistance/social  protection,  local/regional  development  planning, \ndecentralization and governance, institutional development, local government finance, pro-poor \nand  participatory  budgeting,  capacity  development,  poverty  assessment  and  targeting,  and \nmonitoring and evaluation.  The deputy team leader and other long-term domestic experts will \nhave a fluent command of both written and spoken English.   \n \n4.   The consultant team's tasks in each component are as follows: \n \n1.  Local  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (SPKD)  Component  (international,  14 \nperson-months; and domestic, 26 person-months) \n \n(i)  Assess  existing  SPKD  requirements,  guidelines,  and  the  state  of \ncompliance by local governments. \n(ii)  Review a sample of existing SPKDs (both provincial and district level) \nlooking at issues such as their overall quality, the processes under which \nthey  were  prepared,  whether  they  are  being  used  as  planning  or \nbudgeting  documents,  and  what  recommendations  may  be  made  to \nimprove the final product. \n(iii)  Work at the central level with National Development Planning Agency \n(BAPPENAS), Coordinating Ministry for People's Welfare (Menkokesra), \nand  national  poverty  reduction  committee  (KPK)  to  refine  SPKD \nguidelines and develop a comprehensive hands-on training program for \ntproducing  SPKD  in  the  selected  districts.  Coordinate  with  other \ndevelopment partners' projects that may have an SPKD component (e.g., \nCanadian  International  Development  Agency,  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme, World Bank).   \n ", "10  Appendix 3 \n(iv)  Select local governments for SPKD assistance using selection criteria \nacceptable to both the Government and the Asian Development Bank.   \n(v)  Conduct  an  institutional  analysis  of  the  groups  involved  in  SPKD \ndevelopment at the local level, with recommendations for improvement. \n(vi)  On the basis of the institutional analysis, carry out a program of capacity \nbuilding for participatory SPKD development. \n(vii)  Support the development of SPKDs in selected districts (including poverty \nanalysis  and  poverty  mapping,  assessment  of  service  levels  and \nshortfalls,  analysis  of  incomes,  access,  employment,  etc.).  Facilitate \nparticipatory consultations with the poor and with civil society groups to \nprioritize local needs by geographic area, by sector, by social group.   \n(viii)  Support the approval of SPKDs by local parliaments. \n(ix)  Publish and disseminate best practice SPKDs in hard copy and using \nelectronic methods (e.g., websites). \n \n2.  Local Pro-Poor Budgeting Component (international, 14 person-months; and \ndomestic, 26 person-months) \n \n(i)  Review the legal and regulatory framework for planning and budgeting by \nlocal governments, and prepare a policy brief.  Define the scope and \nprocess for pro-poor and participatory budgeting: the likely financial space \nfor  such  activity  in  regional  governments,  any  potential  central \ncontributions, and the process for endorsing such a document.   \n(ii)  Assess the financial implications of satisfying needs identified in SPKD \n(taking  into  consideration  minimum  service  standards  and  targeting \nmechanisms). \n(iii)  Conduct  an  institutional  analysis  of  the  groups  involved  in  budget \ndevelopment at the local levels.  \n(iv)  Develop pro-poor and participatory budgeting guidelines and tool kits, \nespecially  linking  budgeting  to  SPKD.  Coordinate  with  other  ADB \nactivities that may be working on related issues.   \n(v)  On  the  basis  of  the  institutional  analysis,  implement  capacity-building \ndevelopment  for  pro-poor  and  participatory  budgeting  in  the  selected \ndistricts. \n(vi)  Support the development and approval of pro-poor and participatory local \nbudgets with consensus-building mechanisms. \n \n3.  Institutional Development Component (international, 10 person-months; and \ndomestic, 24 person-months) \n \n(i)  Develop  and  implement  an  institutional  and  capacity  development \nprogram  on  poverty  reduction  strategies  for  Indonesia.  This  program \nshould support the work program of the BAPPENAS Deputy Minister for \nPoverty Reduction, who is tasked with devising short-term and medium-\nterm poverty reduction plans. Begin with a review of the national Poverty \nReduction Strategy Paper (finalized September 2005) and past poverty \nreduction programs in Indonesia.  \n(ii)  Develop  and  implement  an  institutional  and  capacity  development \nprogram on improving pro-poor service delivery, with two streams: (a) \nbest practices, and (b) citizen feedback/monitoring mechanisms. Under \n(a) the emphasis should be replicable best practices, and the work should ", "  Appendix  3  11 \nbe  coordinated  with  other  ADB  projects  and  similar  efforts  by  other \ndevelopment partners (e.g., World Bank) so as to avoid overlap. This \nresearch program will begin with a literature review and identification of \nissues in service delivery for the poor.  Best practices should be drawn \nfrom Indonesia wherever possible.  International best practices will come \nfrom  similarly  decentralized  or  decentralizing  countries.  Under  (b) \nmethods for assessing client satisfaction (especially poor clients) will be \ndesigned and tested in the target districts.  \n(iii)  Carry  out  institutional  and  capacity  development  through  a  series  of \nworkshops, seminars, training programs, consultations, publications, and \nuse of electronic methods (e.g., websites). \n \n4.
