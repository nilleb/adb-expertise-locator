INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The regional knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) supports the vision of the \nStrategy 2030 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), to achieve a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, \nand sustainable Asia and the Pacific while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty.1 \nThe TA does this by mobilizing youth from ADB\u2019s developing member countries (DMCs) to \nmaximize  regional  youth  productivity  through  innovating  and  upscaling  youth  employment \nsolutions (YES). The TA supports ADB\u2019s education sector program by engaging with civil society \norganizations  and  nongovernment  organizations  (NGOs)  working  with  youth  and  who  can \ncontribute and add value to youth employability programs.2 The TA builds on lessons from ADB\u2019s \nNGO and Civil Society Center\u2019s Youth for Asia initiative launched under ADB\u2019s TA for Civil Society \nParticipation  for  Development  Effectiveness,  and  supports  ADB\u2019s  proposed  Education \nPartnership Platform by seeking to achieve the following objectives: (i) develop a road map of \ndemonstration projects that increase youth employability; (ii) demonstrate increased youth skills \nand employability; and (iii) expand YES among ADB DMCs, development partners, and youth in \nsupport of poverty reduction and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).3 \n \n2.  The TA is included in the 2018 work plan of ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange Department.4 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Youth in the region are not as productive as they can be. Youth unemployment in Asia \nand the Pacific remains one of the biggest challenges in the region. The International Labour \nOrganization in 2017 indicated that youth unemployment is nearly three times that of adult \nunemployment.5 A closer look at employment trends and the quality of jobs youth have access to \nillustrates that nearly 50% of employed youth in South Asia, more than 25% in Southeast Asia, \nand almost 15% in East Asia are living below the poverty threshold.6 Gender is a clear underlying \nissue, with women often facing barriers that are deeply rooted in culture and prevailing norms that \nprevent access to education and employment opportunities.7 \n \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive, Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. \nManila. \n2  ADB uses the term \u201cyouth\u201d to include individual young people aged 18\u201330 years and youth-led and youth-focused \ncivil society organizations. Such youth organizations generally operate as NGOs. \n3  Youth for Asia is an ADB initiative that was launched in early 2013 to support the participation of youth as important \nstakeholders in development by building their capacity to be engaged meaningfully in ADB operations in the \ncontinuing development of Asia and the Pacific; ADB. 2013. Technical Assistance for Civil Society Participation for \nDevelopment Effectiveness. Manila (TA 8595-REG); and ADB. 2018. Technical Completion Report: Civil Society \nParticipation for Development Effectiveness. Manila (recommendation to \u201csupport the Youth for Asia initiative, \nsupport youth contribution to project operations, increase support to youth employability in the region, and further \nsupport SDG initiatives such as the Youth for Global Goals (Y4GG)\u201d); ADB. 2017. Technical Assistance on Innovation \nin Education Sector Development in Asia and the Pacific. Manila (TA 9415-REG). The TA will be implemented closely \nwith the Education Partnership Platform to leverage opportunities for youth engagement. \n4  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 17 May 2018. \n5  International Labour Organization. 2017. Asia-Pacific Labour Market Update, January 2017. Bangkok, Thailand. \nRegional average youth unemployment is 11.8% (Sri Lanka = 22.2%, Indonesia = 19.5%, and the Philippines = \n14.4%.) \n6  Footnote 5. Defined as $3.10 per day.  \n7  Footnote 5. Average female youth unemployment rate is nearly 20% compared with the 12% average; and wage \npremium of a young male worker is over 17% compared with female employees. \n \n ", "2 \n4.  Maximizing youth productivity requires strategic prioritization of and investments \nin youth employment solutions and youth engagement mechanisms by ADB and DMCs. \nThere are 2.2 billion individuals under the age of 30 living in Asia and the Pacific, comprising 60% \nof the global youth population and making Asia and the Pacific the most youthful region.8  \nStrikingly, the segment aged below 30 represents some 50% of Asia and the Pacific\u2019s total \npopulation.9 Favorable demographics or demographic dividends are often correlated to strong \neconomic development and social progress, but this is contingent on the ability of DMCs to offer \nquality jobs and maximize the productivity of its workers (footnote 1). Among ADB\u2019s regional \nmember countries, 58% of youth live in low middle-income countries and low-income countries;10 \nwithout good education and training, these countries may not be poised to maximize youth \nproductivity. The body of literature shows that youth who live in lower socioeconomic status \nenvironments are disadvantaged when it comes to education, health, employment, and exposure \nto (and at times participation in) nefarious activities, which negatively impact their long-term \nproductivity, exacerbating political conflicts and instability.11 \n \n5.  Youth\u2019s contributions to the implementation of development programs and projects \nadd value to the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. Experience from ADB\u2019s \nTA for Civil Society Participation for Development Effectiveness shows that youth have much to \ncontribute to sustainable development.12 National and regional efforts are needed to create \nenabling environments for wider youth engagement in DMCs supported by development partners. \nMany DMCs do not have adequate engagement mechanisms that facilitate youth participation.13 \nBy enhancing direct engagement with local DMC youth on productivity and employability, ADB \ncan further advance the SDGs. \n \n6.  Youth\u2019s catalytic role in innovating programs and projects is critical for poverty \nreduction. An inclusive approach to development allows DMCs to tap into the creativity of youth. \nFor  example,  youth  often  lead  the  way  in  creating  and  implementing  information  and \ncommunication  technology  for  development  (ICT4D)  and  are  the  primary  users  of  digital \ntechnology. The concept of ICT4D is not new. Some 110 ADB projects (loans and grants) from \n2010 to 2017 have included information and communication technology (ICT). ADB typically uses \nICT to improve (i) project delivery and (ii) for direct use by the beneficiaries. There is evidence in \nthe development literature that youth catalyze ICT4D innovations. YES in the region are not \nkeeping up with innovations in ICT (e.g., internet of things). They are unable to adequately apply \n                                                \n8  United Nations. 2015. World Population Prospects: The 2015 Revision.

While several private sector companies possess the capacity to integrate, teach, and \nimplement digital tools within YES, only a handful of DMCs have digital interventions. \n \n7.  Regional cooperation plays a crucial role in addressing the regional jobs challenge \nand reducing poverty. Regional cooperation is important to maximize youth productivity in \nDMCs  effectively.  For  instance,  the  Association  of  Southeast  Asian  Nations  has  been \nemphasizing and promoting mutual recognition of knowledge and skills, given the high labor \nmobility of youth in the region. Countries are competing to attract talent, and regional cooperation \nand collaboration are necessary to recognize different academic certificates and degrees. There \nis a lack of regional programs that bring about YES and inadequate collaborative mechanisms to \nfacilitate the development of regional YES initiatives. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: employability and productivity of youth in \nselect DMCs increased.14 The TA will have the following outcome: youth skills for employment \nenhanced.15 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Road map of demonstration projects that increase youth employability \ndeveloped.16 Output 1 focuses on identifying, planning, and designing innovative and scalable \ndemonstration activities. The TA will (i) work closely with ADB\u2019s Education Partnership Platform \nand build on outputs from the Solutions for Youth Employment initiative,17 and (ii) identify scalable \nYES preparing a road map of demonstrations to support ADB\u2019s operations in the Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations DMCs, including investment opportunities across Asia and the Pacific. \n \n10.  Output 2: Increased youth skills and employability demonstrated. The TA will (i) \nthrough \u201cWired for Work\u201d ICT tools and expertise: increase capacity of Indonesian government \nagencies to monitor and evaluate JobStart pilots to improve learning and labor market outcomes \nfor young people in Indonesia;18 (ii) support the design of JobStart in Indonesia to capacitate youth \nto gain market-relevant skills through e-learning and blended approaches;19 (iii) support ADB \ninitiatives promoting entrepreneurship and innovation by increasing participation of youth in these \n                                                \n14 United Nations Development Programme. SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth. \n15 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n16 The TA is designed with expansion planned and will respond to support young people, programs and projects, DMCs, \nand capacity building and events from across the Asia and Pacific region. The TA will initially focus on demonstration \nimplementation activities in Indonesia and prepare a road map of demonstrations to develop skills and enhance \nyouth employability for future funding. Demonstration projects will be identified on a demand-driven basis working \nclosely with DMCs and ADB\u2019s regional departments. \n17  Solutions for Youth Employment is a multistakeholder coalition among public and private sectors, civil society actors, \ngovernment officials, foundations, think tanks, and young people that aims to increase the number of young people \nin productive work.  \n18  JobStart is a training pilot project assisting at-risk youth to become job-ready and is being assisted by ADB SERD in \nIndonesia. The TA will provide independent evaluation, ex-post and ex-ante.  \n19 \u201cWired for Work\u201d is the youth employment initiative being implemented by Plan International and Accenture, which \ncreates digital tools to help young people gain the skills required to find employment and entrepreneurship \nopportunities. \n \n ", "4 \ninitiatives and scaling up young entrepreneurs\u2019 financial and business skills, leadership, and \nresilience, among others; (iv) support operational initiatives empowering, mobilizing, and skills-\nbuilding of DMC youth into ADB operations,20 and (v) support youth activities in the Pacific \nregion.21 \n \n11.  Output 3: Youth employment solutions among ADB DMCs, development partners, \nand youth expanded.22 Partnerships with locally based youth organizations are essential to \ncollaborate with DMCs and source, conceptualize, and develop youth-led or youth-focused \nactivities that can be implemented by mobilizing local youth in selected ADB projects that support \nthe  SDGs  and  create  decent  jobs  for  local  youth.  The  TA  will  (i)  support  Youth  for  Asia \npartnerships and regional working groups and networks, activities of ADB\u2019s resident missions with \nDMC youth groups, youth communications through social media channels, and partnering and \nnetworking with universities;23 (ii) mobilize local DMC youth partners to build soft skills through \nparticipating in SDGs-related activities; and (iii) support implementation of employability and skills-\nfocused youth-led events and workshops, including ADB\u2019s flagship Asian Youth Forum. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $300,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources).24 The key expenditure items are listed \nin Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. Individual consultants will be recruited through individual \nconsultant selection to provide international and national consulting inputs. A firm will also be \nrecruited using consultant qualification selection to manage and facilitate youth support.25 ADB \nwill engage the consultants and carry out procurement following the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions and/or \nstaff instructions. The TA will be implemented in close coordination with the Education Sector \nGroup, and civil society organization focal staff in ADB\u2019s regional departments and resident \nmissions.
