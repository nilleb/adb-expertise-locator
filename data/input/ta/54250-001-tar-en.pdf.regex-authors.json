Two-thirds \nof this population have a mobile phone.1 Advances in information and communication technology \n(ICT), especially mobile phones and telecommunication infrastructure, have opened opportunities \nbeyond the traditional bank branch to reach previously underserved populations. Digitalization \nand new distribution channels have the potential to transform the financial industry to make it \nmore inclusive, transparent, and efficient. In addition, digitalization will help the financial industry \nbecome more resilient in coping with an unprecedented situation like the spread of COVID-19 as \nit reduces  person-to-person  contact,  helping to curb contagion  and promoting more resilient \nbusinesses. Financial inclusion through financial institutions (FIs) has proven to have positive \nimpacts on economic growth, poverty reduction, and inequality in the Asia-Pacific region.2 \n \n2.  ADB  is  supporting  the  development  of  sound  digital  finance  ecosystems  through \npublications  and conferences,  as well as assisting  governments  to enable fair and effective \nregulations. ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department (PSOD) has also worked with its FI \nclients through technical assistance (TA) to develop or further enhance digital finance strategies \nand purchase tablets to enable credit officers to reach borrowers, including women, in remote \nareas, for instance. To complement the aforementioned enabling business environment activities \nand the sovereign work to pilot specific untested technologies with smaller non-bank financial \ninstitutions and fintechs,3 the proposed regional capacity TA will support capacity building and \nknowledge sharing among partner FIs ready for ADB funding through nonsovereign operations to \nadopt specific digital finance  solutions for financial inclusion in the context of their strategy, \noperations, and markets. In addition, digitalization would help the FI partner become more resilient \nin coping  with an unprecedented  situation  like the  spread  of COVID-19.  Firsthand  findings \ngathered from partner FIs adopting digital solutions will also help expand the industry knowledge \non practical experiences about challenges and solutions adapted to the different local contexts of \nthe Asia Pacific region. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Digital finance potential. Digital finance, especially supported by mobile technology, has \nthe potential to provide access to financial services for one billion people in Asia, more than half \nof them women. It could increase the volume of loans extended to individuals and businesses by \n$1.2 trillion and allow governments to save $78 billion per year by reducing leakage in spending \nand tax revenue.4 FIs are expected to also benefit through the reduction of more than 50% in \ndirect costs annually while sustainably increasing their balance sheets by as much as $2.85 trillion. \nThe deep impact that digitalization is having and will have in the financial sector is becoming more \nevident. New players are emerging, tapping into these opportunities- younger, more flexible, and \ntargeted financial technology companies (\u201cfintechs\u201d) that specialize in developing highly effective \ntechnology and which are creating alternative finance modalities for customers5 and, on the other \n \n1  Global Findex Database. https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/. \n2  International Monetary Fund. 2018.

Covid-19 Digital Transformation:  COVID-19  has accelerated  FIs\u2019 strategic plans to \nadopt digital  channels  as the mainstream choice. As COVID-19 has spread, FIs have been \nencouraging people to use alternative options to local branches. Early adoption of digital solutions \nlike remote on-boarding of new account holders, acceptance of digital currency, etc. would not \nonly help increase financial inclusion but would also help deal with the impact of COVID-19 and \nfuture public health crises. Individuals at the bottom of the economic pyramid and micro, small \nand medium enterprises (MSMEs)  will be the hardest  hit by the crisis, and digitalization  will \nbecome an essential tool in providing financial assistance to the segment.  \n \n5.  Role for traditional FIs. As fintech innovators and MNOs become more mainstream, their \nshare  of  financial  services  is increasing.  However,  these  new  competitors  are  unlikely  to \ncompletely disintermediate traditional FIs in the near term. Money transfers and payments are the \nfintech technology most adopted (75% of adoption rate in 2019), followed by insurance (48%) \nsavings and investments (34%), financial planning (29%) and borrowings (27%).7 In that context, \nfintech players are increasingly seeking to collaborate with other FIs, and not necessarily bypass \nthem (in the retail space, the share of fintechs with B2B (business to business) offerings has \nincreased from 34% in 2011 to 47% in 2016, while in corporate and investment banking, the share \nis as high as 66%.8 With established networks and already consolidated brands which enhance \nthe trust factor identified as one of the key elements for success rolling-out digital financial \ninnovations,9 traditional FIs have a role to play in the new digital landscape, to the extent they \nadopt technology-driven innovation to differentiate themselves and operate their business more \nefficiently. For financial services providers, the cost of offering customers digital services can be \n80% to 90% percent lower than using physical branches.10 This enables providers to serve many \nmore customers profitably, with a broader set of products and at lower prices.  Women are \nexpected to particularly benefit from the digitalization trend. A growing body of literature suggests \nthat well designed digital finance products can accelerate women\u2019s economic empowerment, give \nwomen  greater  control  over their  finances  and  financial  decision-making,  and  improve  the \nperformance of women-owned businesses.11 Big data and alternative credit models, driven by \ntech adoption, can also open up new markets such as lower income segments for the traditional \nFIs.12 \n \n6.  Challenges. While some countries in the Asia-Pacific region are leaders in ICT and digital \nfinance, on average the region lags behind others in several important areas such as online \npurchases, electronic payments, mobile money, and mobile government transfers.13 Many FIs in \nthe region have adopted new digital and mobile channels, but most of them are still not fully \n \n6  Ernst & Young. 2014.

New credit-risk models for the underbanked. \n13 Ibid. IMF. 2018.  \n \n ", "3 \n \ntapping into the digital finance opportunity to reduce costs and create operational efficiencies. \nTwo-thirds of total budgets for emerging-market  banks are still spent on \u201crunning the bank\u201d, \ninstead of on the effort needed to digitalize banks.14 This data illustrates that the adoption of \ntechnology  in the finance  industry  is not challenge-free.  Challenges  are both  related to the \nbusiness environment (i.e. lack of infrastructure and interoperability, regulatory issues, cultural \nand trust factors, lack of data connectivity, etc.) and bank specific (i.e. legacy issues, IT obsolete \nsystems, etc.). Collaboration between traditional FIs and fintechs can also be a challenge. Big \nbanks don\u2019t always understand new technology and how to implement it; small fintech firms don\u2019t \nunderstand how banks make their investment decisions and find the organizational hierarchies \nconfusing and bureaucratic. With the proliferation of digital finance opportunities on offer, FIs need \nto make strategic decisions on where to focus their investments to deliver a stronger customer \nproposition  to reach more customers  at a lower cost.15 Furthermore,  the digital  gender gap \nremains evident, with an estimated 1.1 billion unconnected women in low- and middle-income \neconomies in Asia Pacific. Digital literacy among many women is lower than among men as their \naccess to training is limited in science, technology, and mathematics that could equip them for \nthe industries that will thrive in the automation age.  Gender stereotypes  about women and \ntechnology are persistent, for instance in Jakarta, more than one-third of male respondents said \nthat it was \u201ctheir responsibility to restrict what women access on the Internet\u201c16 and in India, one \nvillage in Uttar Pradesh implemented a 2,100-rupee fine for any girl using a mobile phone outside \nthe home.17 \n \n7.  Need for customization. While the digitalization trend is global, the key success factors \nto adopt financial technology are not. Each market has its own challenges, cultural nuances, \ninfrastructure, regulation, and customer needs. For FIs to capture the opportunities from digital \nbanking solutions without adding needless complexity and cost, they need to craft digital finance \nstrategies adapted to their specific markets and needs. These strategies will have to consider \nfactors such as: \n \na.  A country\u2019s existing infrastructure, for instance, in countries where a digital ID \nhas already been rolled-out such as India, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan, financial \ninstitutions could leverage technologies such as biometrics, to overcome the lower levels \nof  literacy  among  excluded  groups  like  women.  In  countries  without  this  type  of \ninfrastructure,  FIs  operating  in  remote  areas  should  still  rely  on  traditional  client \nidentification  processes,  but enabled  with technology  such  as  cloud-based  solutions \ninstead of paper-based client origination activities; \n \nb.  Local digital finance ecosystems, for instance, in countries where MNOs are \nwilling to create partnerships and policy integration between the banking and telecom \nsectors, financial institutions can develop alternative credit scoring models using data \nderived from mobile phone use or utilizing alternative methods designed for women who \ndo not have access to traditional credit assets or a credit history; \n \nc.  Customer segments, for instance, financial institutions operating in rural areas \nwith  exposure  to  agriculture  could  partner  with  fintechs  specialized  in  weather  risk \ninsurance  based on satellite  data, to ease climate change  resiliency and adaptation \n \n14 Ibid.

Existing  legacy IT infrastructure, where FIs with old core banking systems, \nwhich do not allow inter-operability with other digital finance applications and need to first \nupgrade  their  IT  operating  models  to  be  strategically  aligned  to  enhance  business \nperformance; \n \ne.  Digital literacy and financial health, foundational to the success of any financial \ninstitution and their customers. While digitization can expand reach, new products and \nservices and account ownership, it is important to ensure that users are able to understand, \ntrust and use digitally delivered services; and \n \nf.  Cybersecurity,  integral  to  any  institution  which  is  undergoing  digital \ntransformation or operating its business on IT infrastructure. As the global economy is \nbecoming more and more digitized, cybersecurity, consumer protection, and data privacy \nand protection will need to fundamentally be at the forefront, especially in the financial \nservices industry.  \n \nIII.  THE CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The  overall  impact  of the TA  is aligned  with  Strategy  2030  which aims  to address \nremaining poverty and reduce inequalities, promote rural development, strengthen governance \nand  institutional  capacity,  and  accelerate  gender  equality  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  through \ninnovation, knowledge sharing and digital transformation. The main impact will be an increase in \nfinancial  services to excluded  segments  that can access efficiently priced, relevant financial \nservices that they would not have otherwise accessed through traditional distribution channels.  \n \n9.  The outcome will be for ADB\u2019s non-sovereign partner FIs adopting specialized digital \nfinance solutions and technology to develop or enhance  and scale innovative products and \nmodels to reach financially excluded segments, and for other industry practitioners to have access \nto in-depth knowledge from first-hand experiences from FIs adopting technology. The TA also \naims to improve the overall efficiency of the partner FIs by providing them options to not only \nautomate the customer outreach but also automate supporting functions like risk management \nand financial reporting, for instance. In addition, digitalization will help the FI partner become more \nresilient in coping with an unprecedented situation like the spread of COVID-19. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Methodology \n \n10.  The goal of this TA is to help PSOD\u2019s partner FIs identify effective digital finance strategies \nthat would allow them to enhance their business to reach more financially excluded customers, \nespecially  women,  in  a more  efficient  way,  and  to  disseminate  practical  knowledge  about \nsuccessful models and practices. To do so, the TA will have two complementary components. \nFor both the components, PSOD will prioritize FIs directly impacted by COVID-19. \n \n11.  Output 1: Digital finance assessments and roadmaps. The TA will fund digital finance \ndiagnoses in up to five selected partner FIs, either at the time of investments or FIs in the existing \n \n18 McKinsey&Company. 2017. Digital disruption in insurance: Cutting through the noise. \n \n ", "5 \n \nportfolio.  This  component  will  include  a  high-level  assessment  of  the  potential  digital \nenhancements that the FI could implement in the context of the existing infrastructure, customer \nsegment and market environment. This component will also include the definition of a roadmap \nfor implementation with timelines, budget, and identification  of the alternatives to source the \ntechnology (either in-house development or partnerships with fintechs or software providers). For \nthat purpose, the consultant and project team will closely coordinate with ADB Ventures to source \nspecific fintech technologies from the network and investee companies ADB Ventures is working \nwith.  Under  this Output, the team  will also explore  ways that technology  can help  women \novercome or circumvent some of the social and cultural barriers to women's financial inclusion.  \nThe assessments  for specific partner FIs will be complemented by the expertise of a gender \nspecialist  who  will  accompany  the  IT  consultants  to identify  opportunities  to  enhance  FIs\u2019 \nmanagement information systems with the identification of existing gender digital financial gaps, \ncollection  of  sex-disaggregated  data  and  recommendation  of  digital  finance  solutions  that \nparticularly target their female clients.19 These assessments and roadmaps will serve three main \nobjectives: i) allow FIs to take informed decisions on the investment needed to enhance their \ncapabilities to reach more customers in a more technology efficient way; ii) serve as the basis for \nfurther discussions on potential use of ADB\u2019s funding in technology enhancements; and iii) gather \nmarket in-depth knowledge on challenges and opportunities faced by FIs adopting and scaling-\nup digital finance solutions.  \n \n12.  The selection of partner FIs will follow the same criteria PSOD currently applies to its FI \nclients when providing debt, equity, or guarantees. These criteria include sound financial health, \nhigh integrity standards, strategic alignment with ADB\u2019s financial inclusion development goals, \nproven track record of effectively delivering financial services to financially underserved segments \nof the population, and a plan to enhance their outreach through technology. The TA resources \nwill only be available to partner FIs for which ADB is processing a funding proposal or are already \npart of PSOD\u2019s portfolio, with priority for equity investees. Incentives  for successful follow-up \nimplementation of the identified solutions will be aligned. The TA will be available for countries \nand partner FIs across the Asia-Pacific region that meet the above-described criteria. The partner \nFIs\u2019 pipelines will be built from two main sources:  \n \na.  Under the \u201cOne-ADB\u201d approach, FIs with which other departments at ADB already \nhave an established relationship under digital finance complementary TAs. For instance, \nunder the Mekong Business Initiative, SDCC\u2019s launched a fintech challenge for Vietnam\u2019s \ncommercial banks to engage with fintechs.20 Under that initiative, banks such as BIDV, \nwere able to develop relationships with fintechs. BIDV received a $300 million A/B loan \nfrom PSFI for SME financing with a focus on underserved rural areas and women-owned \nSMEs,21 which  will  be  further  complemented  with  the  digital  finance  assessments \nproposed under this TA to define the roadmap for implementation of such technology. \nSimilarly,  leads  could also come from the pilot projects implemented  under  SDCC\u2019s \nFinance Sector Group; and \n \nb.  PSFI\u2019s  2020-2021  current  investment  pipeline in strategic  sectors  in inclusive \nfinance that could be enhanced with digital technology in countries such as but not limited \nto Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Papua New Guinea, Bangladesh and India. \n \n19 ADB. 2018.

The TA will also support \nup  to  three  selected  FI  partners  in  sourcing  and  implementing  the  digital  solution.  The \nimplementation support will be on a need basis and it will be evaluated based on management\u2019s \nability and willingness to implement the solution.  \n \n14.  While literature on the benefits of digital finance for financial inclusion is abundant, there \nis still  a gap  on  practical  lessons  learned  adopting  digital  solutions  for  financial  inclusion. \nCombining the copious publicly available studies on digital finance solutions with original content \nfrom  the above exercise, the TA will support  the production  and dissemination  of practical, \napplicable and candid knowledge for practitioners on the challenges and solutions available to \nFIs to adopt digital finance technology depending on their context of operations. The TA will fund \nup to three stories to showcase the actual need, implemented solution, challenges faced and \nbenefits to the selected FI partners. The format of such stories will be multi-media (i.e. write-up, \nvideo, podcast) to increase the dissemination and outreach through different channels including \nsocial media. These knowledge products will also aim to help PSOD promote digital finance and \nsolicit new partners.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing  \n \n15.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, of which (i) $300,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-donor contribution), (ii) $200,000 will \nbe financed  on a grant  basis  by ADB\u2019s Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-income \ntransfer) and (iii) $500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Financial Sector Development \nPartnership Special Fund (FSDPSF22). Additionally, a total of $500,000 will be financed by partner \nFIs, by providing management time and in-kind resources to complement the TA consultants\u2019 \nwork.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n16.  Execution and implementation of the TA will be undertaken by ADB, with PSOD as the \nfocal point or by the selected partner FI. The TA can be delegated to a partner FI if they have \nadequate management capabilities and processes in place to successfully execute the TA. Each \npartner FI will provide ADB with a semi-annual report on all financial activity and milestones of \nthe TA.  \n \n17.  ADB will disburse the TA funds directly to each partner FI through an advance payment \nfacility (APF), following ADB's Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended \nfrom time to time). A financial management assessment will be conducted to determine if the \npartner  FI has adequate financial management  capacity and records keeping capabilities to \nmanage APF.  \n \n18.  The execution of the TA requires the selection of consultants.  ADB will monitor the \nselection and procurement steps, check that the use of funds complies with relevant ADB policies, \nand check that outputs for development effectiveness are on track. \n \n19.  Each partner FI and ADB will enter into a TA agreement that sets out the terms and \nconditions for the TA, including  the partner FI's responsibilities  in selecting, contracting, and \n \n22 Established by ADB.

The TA \nagreement will (i) refer to the relevant agreed selection and contracting frameworks to be used,  \n(ii) confirm ADB's concurrence at each relevant stage of the selection process, and (iii) require \ndocumentation  of the execution of the TA; procurement (including consulting services) to be \nfinanced by ADB TA Funds will follow ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to \ntime) and Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time).  \n \n20.  For Output 1 and 2, the TA deliverable will be implemented with the help of an international \nconsulting firm or individual consultant (on a case by case basis depending on the specific country \nexpertise) with proven experience in digital finance in the private sector of emerging markets. The \nconsultant will also have specific experience in IT due diligence, strategies, product marketing \nand development, roadmaps, project management and solution implementation. The expertise of \nthe international consultant will also be coupled with the work of a local consultant firm that would \ndo  the  research  work  in  relation  to  the  market  environment,  local  ecosystem,  existing \ninfrastructure, etc. Output 1 will require 18 person-months of international consultant services and \n18 person-months of local consultant services. Output 1 will be implemented over 24 months from \nthe start date. Output 2 will require 24 person-months of international consultant services and  \n24 person-months of local consultant services. Output 2 will be implemented over 36 months from \nthe start date. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  July 2020\u2013December 2025 \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by Asian Development  \nQBS / SSS  Output 1 & 2   $1,000,000 \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical \nAssistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time \nto time).
