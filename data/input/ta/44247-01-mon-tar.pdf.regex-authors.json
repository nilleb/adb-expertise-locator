INTRODUCTION \n1.  The  technical  assistance  (TA)  builds  on  achievements  under  a  previous  TA  which \nintroduced managing for development results (MfDR) principles to investment planning, and \ndeveloped  options  for  improved  public  funds  management.1 The  earlier  MfDR  TA  was \nsuccessful in demonstrating how public investment planning and monitoring can be linked with \nstrategic sector objectives, and piloted the approach in key sectors.  \n \n2.  The Government of Mongolia has requested further assistance in applying MfDR in \nnational  planning,  investment  planning  in  selected  line  ministries,  and  related  capacity \ndevelopment. The goal of the proposed TA is to contribute to a stronger results orientation in \nnational development planning and implementation processes, and to better management of \npublic resources. The proposed TA is included in the Mongolia country operations business plan, \n2009\u20132012.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  The proposed TA will support integration of MfDR in the public sector management cycle \n(i.e.  planning,  budgeting,  monitoring  and  evaluation),  strengthen  the  results  orientation  in \nnational development planning and implementation processes, and improve the management of \npublic resources.  \n \n4.  The government is a signatory to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. It has \nformed  seven  technical  working  groups  to  foster  harmonization,  and  has  established  the \nNational Development and Innovation Committee (NDIC) which reports to the Prime Minister \nand is responsible for strengthening prioritization and improving the effectiveness of public \ninvestments. While the Ministry of Finance has retained its oversight responsibilities for public \nsector financing, the NDIC is playing an increasing role in public investment planning.  \n \n5.  The previous MfDR TA has been at the center of the government and ADB's sector \nstrategy  work  aimed  at  mainstreaming  the  MfDR  approach  in  investment  planning  and \nmeasurement of development outcomes. It has supported assessments of performance based \nmonitoring  systems  in  the  urban  and  education  sectors,  development  of  sector-specific \ninvestment  roadmaps,  and  mechanisms  for  improved  targeting  of  social  expenditures. \nAssistance under the TA has been timely in light of the fiscal impact of the global financial crisis, \nand has achieved strengthened capacity development through ongoing engagement of the \nMinistry of Finance and line ministries in dialogue on investment planning. \n \n6.  Establishment of the NDIC in December 2008 was an important step toward integrating \nMfDR principles into national processes for planning, budgeting, monitoring and evaluation of \npublic investments, and the new agency is making steady progress. In its first 18 months, NDIC \nhas  (i)  developed  a  draft  medium-term  development  strategy,  2010\u20132015  Development \nPriorities, together with a medium-term investment plan, Midterm Development Priorities; (ii) \nprepared an annual development plan, Socio Economic Development Guidelines, that is based \non the medium-term development strategy; (iii) developed a socioeconomic development index \nto monitor progress on the medium-term development strategy; (iv) prepared a database to \ncollect and organize data on public investment from government agencies, and a survey to \n                                                 \n1   ADB.  2007.

The TA first appeared in the business \nopportunities section of ADB's website on 16 June 2010. \n ", "2 \ncollect data on private investment; and (v) prepared a draft law on planning in collaboration with \nthe Ministry of Finance to ensure compatibility with the draft budget law, which is also expected \nto be considered by Parliament in 2010. \n \n7.  Additional work is needed to turn these plans and processes into a successful public \ninvestment  planning  process,  particularly  in  an  environment  in  which  a  greater  range  of \nfinancing options are being considered by the government. Currently, projects are taken directly \nto the cabinet for approval without screening them to ensure consistency with the National \nDevelopment Strategy (NDS). The public investment program focuses on domestically-financed \nprojects,  and  foreign-funded  projects  are  planned  and  presented  outside  this  framework. \nMongolia's budget classification system generally complies with international norms and the \nannual government budget document discusses progress made in the projects, although without \ndiscussing their strategic rationale, consistency with the domestic public investment program, \nand overall prioritization. While line ministries undertake strategic planning exercises, these are \nnot effectively costed, adequately scrutinized, or coordinated with the government\u2019s overall \npriorities.  \n \n8.  The effectiveness of assistance from Mongolia's development partners is inextricably \nlinked  with  the  application  of  MfDR  principles  to  national  investment  planning  and  public \nexpenditure management. A joint review of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World \nBank  portfolios  in  Mongolia  in  2009  revealed  a  common  set  of  priority  issues.  However, \ninvestments are slow to start up because of a lack of readiness at project inception, which \ndelays benefits and increases administrative costs. Procurement delays are pervasive due to \nweak  capacity  and  an  excessive  number  of  small  contracts.  Frameworks  for  monitoring \ninvestment performance are mostly focused on inputs and outputs rather than on impacts and \noutcomes. Addressing these shortcomings will help to link investments with national priorities \nand deliver more effective and relevant outcomes.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The  impact  of  the  proposed  TA  will  be  results-based  public  investment  planning, \nimplementation,  and  monitoring  at  the  national  level.  The  outcome  of  the  TA  will  be  the \napplication of MfDR principles in planning and management by the Ministry of Finance, NDIC \nand line ministries and agencies concerned. The TA will: (i) develop sector-specific results \nframework in priority sectors; (ii) improve the results focus in project design, implementation, \nmonitoring, and evaluation; (iii) strengthen results-based public sector financial management; (iv) \nlink public sector investment planning to the NDS and to a multi-year budget; (v) improve \nintegrity  and  accountability  in  the  management  of  public  resources;  (vi)  strengthen  aid \ncoordination,  harmonization,  and  effectiveness;  (vii)  develop  risk  assessments;  and  (viii) \nimprove the MfDR capacities of the Ministry of Finance, NDIC, the State Property Committee \nand selected line ministries. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n10.  The  proposed  TA  has  three  components:  (i)  mainstreaming  MfDR  in  public  sector \nmanagement;  (ii)  improved  results-based  delivery  and  coordination  of  official  development \nassistance  to  Mongolia;  and  (iii)  institutional  and  human  capacity  building  through  advice, \nanalytical support and training. \n \n ", "3 \n11.  The first component will help the government to mainstream key principles of MfDR, \nincluding  a  results  focus  throughout  the  public  sector  management  cycle,  and  strengthen \nevidence-based policy and program decision making based on a clear framework for results, \nmonitoring and evaluation. Key outputs will include: (i) application of MfDR principles in planning, \nbudgeting, monitoring and evaluation; (ii) completion of sector risk assessments and action \nplans  in  four  sectors;  and  (iii)  strengthened  capacity  in  Ministry  of  Finance  and  four  line \nagencies in audit, procurement and anticorruption measures. Activities will focus on clarifying \nthe delineation of roles and mandates among government institutions for improving results \norientation  in  national  development  planning,  implementation,  procurement,  monitoring  and \ncoordination; and establishing stronger links between national plans and strategies by devising \nresults frameworks and guidelines for relevant ministries and government agencies.  \n \n12.  The  second  component  will  help  to  strengthen  the  government's  role  in  improving \nefficiency and effectiveness of official development assistance to ensure strong links with the \nNDS and results delivery. Key outputs will include establishment of coordination, communication \nand  reporting  systems  across  institutions  for  effective  integration,  programming,  and \nimplementation  of  national  development  strategies;  and  increased  public  awareness, \ntransparency, and capacity in public procurement. Activities include (i) assisting the government \nto  formulate  sector-wide  assistance  approaches  in  priority  areas  of  ADB  assistance;  (ii) \nassisting  the  government  to  identify  its  aid  needs  and  to  coordinate  and  co-lead  donor \nharmonization  efforts,  especially  in  priority  areas  of  ADB  intervention;  (iii)  engaging  with \nexecuting agencies to improve ADB portfolio performance, particularly in procurement and at \nproject  start-up;  and  (iv)  engaging  other  development  partners  and  local  nongovernment \norganizations in assessing, monitoring, and reviewing the development effectiveness of external \nassistance,  including  joint  efforts  toward  improved  procurement  processes,  practices,  and \noutcomes. \n \n13.  The  third  component  will  continue  to  develop  institutional  capacity  by  following  up \nactivities initiated during the previous TA. The components will support the following outputs: (i) \naddressing knowledge gaps through advisory services, analytical work and other knowledge \nservices  including  policy  briefs;  (ii)  improved  human  capacity  in  MfDR  approaches  by \nconducting joint workshops and conferences that promote MfDR principles. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n14.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $2,120,000 equivalent. The government has \nrequested ADB to finance $1,800,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s technical assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The government will finance the balance of \nthe  cost,  equivalent  to  $320,000,  through  the  provision  of  counterpart  staff,  office  space, \nworkshop  venues,  and  other  in-kind  contributions (see  Appendix  2  for  details  of  the  cost \nestimates and financing plan).  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n15.  The  Ministry  of  Finance  will  be  the  executing  agency  for  the  TA,  which  will  be \nimplemented over 2.5 years from 14 September 2010 to 28 February 2013. The government will \nform a steering committee that will be chaired by the Ministry of Finance and will comprise \nrepresentatives of the Ministry of Finance and NDIC. The Ministry of Finance will be the direct \ngovernment counterpart for the proposed TA and will be responsible for coordinating activities. \nThe Ministry of Finance will assign a vice-minister or state secretary as project director, who will \ncoordinate overall implementation of the proposed TA within the Ministry of Finance and with \n ", "4 \nNDIC and line ministries. A department within the Ministry of Finance will be designated to \nassist the project director with day-to-day implementation, and with coordinating with ADB and \nTA consultants. \n \n16.  The total consultants\u2019 input is estimated at 35 person-months of international and 82 \nperson-months of national consulting services. The consultants will be engaged as individuals in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to \ntime).  The  international  consultants  will  include  public  sector  financial  management  and \nmonitoring specialists (6 person-months), sector specialists (20 person-months), public financial \nsector specialist (6 person-months), and procurement experts (3 person-months). The national \nconsultants will include a project coordinator (18 person-months), monitoring and evaluation \nexperts  (14  person-months),  sector  experts  (22  person-months),  capital  market  expert  (4 \nperson-months), training specialists (12 person-months), and procurement experts (12 person-\nmonths). The terms of reference for consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n \n17.  Since consulting services will cover a broad range of areas and sectors, some of which \nare to be determined during project implementation, and considering that most assignments will \nbe small and on an intermittent basis, hiring individual consultants is considered appropriate. \nThe government will provide the TA consultants with a suitably furnished office with utilities, \ntelecommunication access, materials, maps, data and all related documents required by the TA. \nCosts associated with training programs, workshops and conferences will be administered by \nindividual consultants. The proceeds of the TA will be disbursed in accordance with ADB's \nTechnical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S RECOMMENDATION \n18.  The President recommends that the Board approve the provision of technical assistance \nnot exceeding the equivalent of $1,800,000 on a grant basis to the Government of Mongolia for \nManaging for Development Results. \n ", "Appendix 1 5\n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions and \nSummary  Targets/Indicators Mechanisms Risks\nImpact      Assumptions \nResults-based public  The process for results-  Government technical  The government \ninvestment planning,  based development and  meetings, reports  preserves  the current \nimplementation and  implementation of    institutional structure. \nmonitoring at the national  national development  ADB CPS completion   \nlevel achieved.  strategies are  reports  The government \nstreamlined and instilled,    continues its \nby December 2015.
