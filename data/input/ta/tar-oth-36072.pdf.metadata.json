INTRODUCTION \n1.    In November 1999, the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS)1 of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) was launched to make poverty reduction the overarching objective of ADB\u2019s \nsupport of development investments in the Asia and Pacific region. The PRS is framed in terms \nof  three  mutually  reinforcing  \u201cpillars\u201d:  pro-poor  sustainable  economic  growth,  social \ndevelopment, and good governance. The PRS identified key elements and approaches for its \nimplementation, and outlined a  program of action to align all ADB operations?ADB country \nstrategies and programs (CSPs) and project-level interventions and nonlending products and \nservices?with its poverty reduction goal.   \n \n2.    The implementation of the PRS commenced in January 2000, when ADB began key \nactivities stipulated in the PRS to retool its operations. This process involved assisting individual \ndeveloping member countries (DMCs) in formulating and integrating their poverty reduction \nstrategies into the CSP formulation process. The process was launched in most of the DMCs \nand culminated with the preparation of poverty partnership agreements (PPAs), 18 of which \nhave been signed. In parallel with this exercise, sector development priorities and a pipeline of \nproject concepts were also developed to identify poverty reduction approaches. These were \nincorporated into the pipeline as poverty interventions that would address poverty targets \nidentified in the CSPs and PPAs. \n \n3.  The  PRS  stated  that  the  strategy  would  be  reviewed  after  3  years.  This  regional \ntechnical assistance (TA) proposal2 is to provide key inputs to the review process. The concept \nfor the TA was prepared in January 2003, reviewed and endorsed by the Poverty Committee in \nFebruary 2003, and cleared by the Knowledge Management Committee in April 2003. The \nproposal  incorporates  comments  received  from  the  poverty  and  knowledge  management \ncommittees. \n \nII.  ISSUES  \n4.       The PRS requires ADB to support a wide range of initiatives, based on the assumption \nthat all three pillars\u2014pro-poor sustainable economic growth, social development, and good \ngovernance\u2014if supported simultaneously, would promote the \u201csocially inclusive development\u201d \ndeemed essential to reduce poverty in its many dimensions. Since 2000, ADB has supported a \nbroad spectrum of policies and projects addressing each pillar. They include (i) promoting sound \nmacroeconomic management deemed necessary to generate labor-absorbing employment and \nincome, raise productivity, target poor areas, and foster regional and subregional economic \ncooperation  to  open  up  markets;  (ii)  supporting  social  development,  through  project \ninterventions  addressing  human  capital  development,  population  policy,  social  capital \ndevelopment,  gender  equality,  and  social  protection;  and  improving  the  poor\u2019s  access  to \nessential services; and (iii) supporting DMC efforts to reform the civil service and/or decentralize \ngovernment and adopt good governance practices, including pro-poor policies, government \naccountability,  public  participation,  predictable  legal  frameworks,  transparency,  and  anti-\ncorruption initiatives. The breadth and likely impact of these multitudinous programs need to be \nexamined from several aspects: whether ADB is following the principles underlying the strategy; \nhow ADB operated in concert with other funding agencies and development partners in helping \nDMCs  formulate  poverty  reduction  strategies;  how  PRS  was  adapted  to  diverse  DMC \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1999. Fighting Poverty in Asia and the Pacific: The Poverty Reduction Strategy. Manila. \n2 The TA first appeared in the ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 11 April 2003. In view of the urgency \nin the implementation of the TA, the required 3 listings have been waived. \n ", "2  \nconditions; and whether PRS is still relevant, or needs to be modified, in light of the changing \ncontext of the Asia and Pacific region since 2000. \n \n5.   Subsequent to the launching of the PRS, ADB formulated a medium-term and a long-\nterm  framework  in  two  key  documents?ADB\u2019s  Long-Term  Strategic  Framework3  and the \nMedium-Term Strategy4?to translate the goals, objectives, and broad policies of the PRS into a \ntime-bound action plan to improve ADB\u2019s effectiveness in reducing poverty. The Millennium \nDevelopment Goals (MDGs) were incorporated in both documents as benchmarks to be used to \nassist DMCs in addressing the multiple dimensions of poverty. The MDGs, along with country-\nspecific poverty indicators, have been reflected in national poverty reduction strategies of \nDMCs, and have been incorporated in the PPAs and CSPs of many of these countries. \nSimultaneously, macroeconomic and sector analyses conducted at the country level have \nidentified  new  focal  areas  for  integrating  poverty  reduction  approaches  within a broader \neconomic growth framework. The analyses reflect current development literature, espousing, \namong  others,  theories  on  the  poverty  impact  of  broad-based economic growth. Equally \nimportant, the experience provided valuable insights on the diversity of DMC conditions that \nshaped the perceptions and objectives of poverty reduction strategies and CSPs that resulted \nfrom the process. The TA will support the review of the PRS in light of such developments, and \nidentify, if necessary, modifications for  achieving medium- and long-term poverty reduction \ntargets within the context of the Medium-Term Strategy and Long-Term Strategic Framework. \nThe TA findings will also enable ADB to disseminate knowledge about the best practices, as \nlearned from implementing the PRS across the region.  \n \n6.  Given that PRS implementation has required fundamental changes in ADB operations, \nthe experience, views, and insights gained by staff and their counterparts in DMCs involved will \nprovide valuable feedback on lessons learned. In particular, their feedback can be used to \nidentify (i) the challenges that were encountered, (ii) insights on what moved the poverty \nreduction agenda forward, and (iii) the human resources and institutional capacity needed to \nimplement the PRS. Thus, the review will include a survey and visits to a few DMCs to interview \nparticipants on key aspects of PRS implementation. Given the importance of the review process \nas an internal stocktaking exercise, the proposed review process will be led by senior staff and \nADB management, with consultants providing support for workshops, data analysis, and draft \nreport inputs.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Purpose and Output \n7.  The  TA  will  support  the  review  of  the  PRS,  and  will  provide  consulting  services \nnecessary to facilitate the document review, analysis of findings, and preparation of technical \npapers. The primary output will be the PRS review report. The report will (i) describe the \nprocess and progress of PRS implementation, and assess whether ADB is implementing the \nPRS as originally stipulated; (ii) describe how ADB acted in concert with other agencies in \nhelping  DMCs  prepare  their  poverty  reduction  strategies  and  incorporate  MDGs  in  the \nstrategies; and (iii) in light of changing perspectives in reducing poverty, assess whether PRS  \nremains valid, and what modifications, if any, are required. The TA design framework is in \nAppendix 1.  \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2001. Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank (2001\u20132015).

The  review  process  will  initially  focus  on  document  review  and  staff consultation \nregarding  the  outputs  of  3  years  of  PRS  implementation,  incorporated  in  country-level \noperations, comprising poverty analyses, national poverty reduction strategies, PPAs, CSPs, \nCSP updates, and poverty-oriented TAs and loans. The review will also examine the related \ninstitutional changes and capacity-building efforts undertaken at ADB headquarters and in \nresident missions, including reorganization of ADB operations, staffing, training, and allocation \nof resources. The findings will be analyzed in light of the three pillars comprising the strategy \nframework (para. 4); the components of the strategy at the ADB, country, and sector levels; and \nthe \u201cprogram of action\u201d stipulated in the PRS.  \n \n9.  The review will seek to obtain feedback from ADB staff in headquarters and resident \nmissions, and from DMCs. Staff feedback will be obtained through structured interviews, focus \ngroups, and a questionnaire dealing with aspects of changes in ADB operations to integrate \npoverty reduction considerations in their work and the challenges encountered. Feedback from \nat  least  five  DMCs5  will  be  obtained  through  structured  interviews,  focus  groups,  and \ndiscussions with key stakeholders. Special efforts will be made to consult with nongovernment \norganizations and civil society organizations.  \n \n10.  To provide a basis for external validation of the review, a panel comprising 3-4 experts \non poverty reduction approaches will be invited to review the draft report and serve as resource \npersons for a forum toward the end of the review. Their collective expertise will be drawn upon \nto help develop recommendations for ADB consideration concerning PRS implementation, and \nthe strategy itself. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $300,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on \na grant basis by ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Cost estimates are provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.   ADB  will  implement  the  TA  through  the  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment  (RSDD).  A  steering  committee  appointed  by  Management  will  have  overall \nresponsibility for the PRS review. The committee will be chaired by the special advisor to the \nPresident, and the membership will be composed of the chief economist; the directors general \nof  the  Operations  Evaluation  Department  (OED),  Regional  and  Sustainable  Development \nDepartment (RSDD), Strategy and Policy Department (SPD), and the five regional departments.  \nThe review will be conducted by a task force of five staff, guided by the steering committee. The \ntask force will be responsible for managing all inputs6 and in drafting the final review report. A \npanel of about 12 staff members will be convened regularly to review draft technical papers and \nthe draft and final review report, and to provide the task force with a forum to discuss ideas and \noptions. Individual staff and the Poverty Committee will contribute at various stages of the  \nreview process, such as identifying topics and issues for the technical papers to be produced \nand assisting with the design and conduct of questionnaires and focus group discussion to \nobtain feedback from staff and DMCs. \n \n                                                 \n5 One DMC per regional department will be selected for the field visit. All other DMCs will be covered through a \nquestionnaire survey covering key findings from the fieldwork in the five DMCs. \n6  Including technical papers on key topics to be covered in the review. \n ", "4  \n13.  The TA will be implemented over 6 months from May 2003. The consulting services \nprovided under the TA will complement staff inputs primarily to do some of the analytical work \nand help review the experience of other agencies. The estimated consulting services comprise \napproximately 7 person-months of international and 8 person-months of domestic consulting \nservices. The consultants will be recruited on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the \nengagement of domestic consultants. The expertise and the length of services needed  from \neach consultant will be further identified during TA implementation as and when they are \nrequired to complement staff inputs. The terms of reference for the consulting services is \noutlined  in  Appendix  3.  A  tentative  outline  for  the  resulting  information  paper  is  given  in \nAppendix 4. \n \nIV.
