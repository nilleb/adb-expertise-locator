Cambodia\u2019s Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sport and Mongolia\u2019s Ministry of Science, \nTechnology, Education, and Culture have requested a follow-up project to a previous regional \ntechnical  assistance  (TA)  project.1  The  new  project  aims  at  addressing  the  challenges  of \nmanaging for development results (MfDR) resulting from the gradual decentralization of public \nadministration  systems.  Indonesia  has  much  to  contribute  in  this  area,  because  of  its \nconsiderable experience with decentralizing social sector management in the context of defining \nand implementing minimum service standards. The Cambodian, Indonesian, and Mongolian \nministries of health expressed an interest in getting involved in relation to an assessment of their \ncurrent structures for MfDR at central and local government levels. \n \n2.  In October and November 2004, the five education and health sector ministries reviewed \nthe  draft  TA  proposal  and  concurred  with  its  goals,  purpose,  scope,  and  implementation \narrangements. They also agreed to establish task forces to plan, manage, and implement  the \nregional TA in their respective countries, including reestablishing the task force on results-based \nmanagement (RBM) in education in Cambodia and Mongolia under the TA for Strengthening \nResults-Based Management for Sector Agencies (TA 6089-REG). The work is expected to draw \non MfDR experiences in social sectors operating in a decentralized context in other developing \nmember countries (DMCs), including Pakistan. Extensive consultation was undertaken within \nthe Regional and Sustainable Development Department and with Asian Development Bank \n(ADB)  staff  responsible  for  the  education  and  health  sectors  in  the  three  DMCs.  The  TA \nframework is shown in Appendix 1.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  TA  6089  strengthened  the  governments\u2019  ownership  and  understanding  of  MfDR  in \nrelation to institutional assessment and their commitment to selectively implement more MfDR. \nThe key TA outputs and achievements were (i) in-country seminars, which ensured substantial \nownership  and  understanding  of  RBM  approaches  toward  education  sector  planning  and \nmanagement; (ii) RBM case studies, which have proved to be an effective vehicle whereby \neducation staff can apply RBM assessment instruments; (iii) RBM road maps, which have \ninvolved  the  identification  of  immediate  and  medium-term  priorities  for  capacity  building, \nincluding  measures  to  improve  strategic  planning  processes,  enhance  alignment  between \ndelegated  authorities  and  resource  management  at  various  levels,  develop  information \ntechnology  networks,  and  initiate  joint  processes  for  reviewing  sector  performance  by  the \ngovernment,  external  funding  agencies,  and  nongovernment  organizations;  (iv)  and \ndissemination and knowledge-sharing efforts, such as an RBM information booklet, web sites, \nand an exchange visit by Mongolian officials to Cambodia, which have enabled broader and \nmore diverse information exchanges on RBM between the two countries and within ADB. TA \n6089  demonstrated  that  processes  for  MfDR  cannot  be  achieved  overnight,  and  that \ngovernments and ADB need to address the gap between desired results and implementation \nand resource capacities. Another lesson learned is that involving cross-cutting agencies, such \nas the Ministry of Finance, Home Affairs/Interior, and local governments early on during the \nprocess and in the analytical work involved in assessing the impact of decentralization reforms \nis essential for designing RBM systems and strengthening the quality of service delivery.  \n                                                 \n1 Asian Development Bank. 2002. Technical Assistance for Strengthening Results-Based Management for Sector \nAgencies. Manila (TA 6089-REG for $250,000, approved on 19 December 2002). This TA was implemented from \nJanuary  2002  to  September  2004  in  Cambodia  and  Mongolia.  For  details,  see \nhttp://www.adb.org/projects/rbm/default.asp. \n2 The technical assistance first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (internet edition) on 5 October 2004.  \n ", "2  \n4.  MfDR is a major policy thrust of ADB and its member countries. ADB\u2019s RBM agenda \ninvolves introducing and mainstreaming a comprehensive system for monitoring, measuring, \nreporting, and managing for development results. The TA is designed to contribute to the \nfollowing components of ADB\u2019s results action plan: (i) strengthen the focus on results, both by \nthe three DMCs and as an institution; (ii) assist in building capacity for RBM in the DMCs; (iii) \ndevelop the ability to measure and analyze progress toward results; and (iv) use information \nabout results to improve performance.  \n \n5.  During  the  last  decade,  a  number  of  DMCs  have  embarked  on  ambitious \ndecentralization reforms aimed at achieving more democratic, accountable, and transparent \ndelivery  of  services  in  order  to  meet  poverty  reduction  targets.  This  involves  transferring \nfunctions  and  funding  sources  to  local  governments  as  well  as  revising  accountability \nmechanisms at the local level and between the central government and local governments. In \naddition,  for  the  expected  benefits  of  decentralization  reforms  to  materialize,  far-reaching \nchanges are needed in the management of service delivery. In a centralized system, sector \nagencies are responsible for delivering services, while in a decentralized system, the sector \nagencies\u2019 focus shifts to target setting, monitoring, evaluation, and capacity development related \nto service delivery by local governments. Further challenges arise at the local level, where \naccountability mechanisms need to be established and coordination mechanisms between local \ngovernments and civil society need to be established.  \n \n6.  MfDR  in  a  decentralized  context  requires  (i)  defining  results  that  are  measurable, \nrelevant, and meet both national targets and local priorities; (ii) providing adequate resources to \nachieve the targeted results; (iii) establishing intergovernmental fiscal arrangements that create \ndirect incentives for local service delivery based on previously established performance norms; \n(iv) setting up organizational arrangements that ensure that authority and responsibilities are \naligned  with  results  and  resources;  (v)  developing  processes  for  planning,  monitoring, \ncommunication,  and  fund  allocation  and  release  that  enable  sector  agencies  and  local \ngovernments to convert resources into the desired impacts; and (vi) setting up accountability \nmechanisms at all levels of government. Most DMC sector and local government agencies have \nlittle experience in dealing with management reforms at this scale. The TA supports ADB\u2019s \ngovernance and MfDR agenda by increasing awareness in DMCs of ways to address the need \nfor changes in the results management of the social sector in a decentralized context.  \n  \n7.  Cambodia\u2019s and Mongolia\u2019s education sectors have reached their current advanced \nstage of MfDR development through more than 10 years of sustained effort and commitment \nbacked by leadership and sponsorship from inside and outside the education ministries. Further \nstrengthening of RBM processes will require a realistic initial institutional assessment, a review \nof opportunities for capacity development in the medium term, and a determination of likely \nsector resources. The recent ADB review of its poverty reduction strategy3 identified systemic \ncapacity development as a key challenge and recommended its introduction as a new cross-\ncutting theme for ADB operations. The TA supports this agenda by helping the three DMCs to \nprepare  institutional  and  capacity  assessments  that  will  lead  to  increased  ownership  and \nsustainability of projects in the respective sectors.  \n \n                                                 \n3 Asian Development Bank. 2004.

The goal of the TA is to develop the service delivery capacity of social sector and local \ngovernment agencies. Its purpose is to (i) strengthen the MfDR orientation of social sector and \nlocal  government  agencies  in  three  gradually  decentralizing  countries,  namely,  Cambodia, \nIndonesia,  and  Mongolia;  and  (ii)  establish  mechanisms  for  knowledge  management  and \nexchange within and between the three countries.  \n \n9.  The TA\u2019s components include (i) developing a methodology that will enable sector and \nlocal government agencies to assess the implications of ongoing decentralization reforms for \ntheir existing MfDR processes; (ii) preparing and pilot testing MfDR road maps, focusing on \ncapacity  development  priorities  arising  from  country-specific  decentralization  and  MfDR \ncontexts; and (iii) providing a platform for the exchange of experiences between sector and local \ngovernment agencies within the three DMCs, between their health and education sectors, and \nbetween stakeholders of the three DMCs.  \n \n10.  The TA will have three carefully integrated outputs as follows: \n(i)  Methodology  for  MfDR  developed  and  decentralization  baseline \nassessments available. The sector and local governments in the three DMCs \nwill  be  enabled  to  analyze  the  decentralization  context  and  to  assess  the \nimplications  of  decentralization  reforms  for  their  MfDR  processes.  Particular \nemphasis will be placed on strengthening strategic planning at various levels of \ngovernment,  monitoring  and  evaluation  of  service  delivery  targets,  and \nstrengthening  networks  and  partnerships.  The  methodology  will  include  a \nbackground study on the impact of decentralization reforms on the social sectors; \na participatory institutional assessment; a stakeholder analysis; and specific case \nstudies in each country to be conducted by working groups whose composition \nwill include sector agency officials, local government officials, and officials from \ncross-cutting ministries (such as ministries of planning, of finance, and of the \ninterior and/or of local government and/or of home affairs). Long-term advisers \nretained by ADB or other external funding agencies that specialize in projects \nrelevant to the TA, i.e., fiscal affairs, administrative or political decentralization, \nperformance management, and public expenditure management, as well as civil \nsociety organizations that specialize in relevant fields, will be invited to join the \nworking groups.  \n(ii)  Capacity development road maps for MfDR and decentralization prepared \nand implemented. Capacity development priorities will be determined based on \nthe  findings  under  output  (i)  and  at  least  one  workshop  in  each  country. \nAgreement on priority actions to address shortcomings will be sought. Based on \nthe agreed priority actions, capacity development measures for each DMC will be \ndesigned, costed out, pilot tested, and shared with relevant ADB operational \ndepartments and other external funding agencies.  \n(iii)  Findings and approaches disseminated within each country and across the \nthree countries. The findings will be disseminated through workshops, the social \nsector agencies\u2019 web sites, brochures, and other means. Efforts will be made to \nexchange experiences between health and education sectors. Based on case \nstudies and an assessment of potential lessons for all three DMCs involved in the \nTA, a staff exchange program will be designed and implemented. \n \n ", "4  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n11.  Cambodia,  Indonesia,  and  Mongolia  have  been  selected  for  this  TA  because  it  is \nconsistent with the reform agendas of the three countries and ADB\u2019s strategic priorities. The \nmain features of social sector development in the three countries are (i) a strong emphasis on \nresults-oriented  planning  and  management  in  the  social  sectors;  (ii)  a  growing  focus  on \ndecentralized  planning  and  management  of  service  delivery;  (iii)  a  growing  emphasis  on \nsectorwide or program-based approaches; and (iv) the use of social sector program lending \nlinked to joint monitoring of the sector\u2019s performance by the government, ADB, and other \nexternal funding agencies. As a result, the selected countries are important potential leaders in \nimplementing ADB\u2019s medium-term agenda and action plan for promoting MfDR. The TA will also \ncooperate closely with analytical and operational work on decentralization and results-oriented \nsector management being undertaken in Pakistan.  \n \n12.  The following are the expected deliverables: \n(i)   methodology for assessing baseline capacities for decentralization and MfDR \nbased on one orientation workshop in each of the three DMCs; \n(ii)   participatory institutional assessment of the decentralization context in the three \ncountries  carried  out  through  desk  reviews,  case  studies,  participatory \nworkshops, and field visits to local governments in each country; \n(iii)   stakeholder analysis of education and health in Cambodia,  health in Indonesia, \nand education and health in Mongolia that addresses the roles of sector agencies \nat various levels of government, of civil society, and of local governments;  \n(iv)   five case studies for each of the countries to inform the institutional assessment \nand/or the stakeholder analysis; \n(v)   preparation of capacity development road maps for three sectors (CAM Health, \nMON Health, INO Health) and review of existing road maps for two sectors (CAM \nEducation,  MON  Education)    by  means  of  case  studies  and  participatory \nworkshops; \n(vi)   work  planning  and  programming  and  implementation  of  pilots  for  selected \ncapacity development priorities;         \n(vii)   efforts to engage the education sector in Indonesia in peer learning for MfDR \nprocesses and exchange of experiences through workshops and working groups \non specific issues; \n(viii)   dissemination materials, in particular, ADB and ministry web sites, brochures, \nand presentation materials;  \n(ix)   up to two exchange visits for up to six participants each; and \n(x)   synthesis document on decentralization and MfDR in the social sectors in the \nAsia and Pacific region.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The total TA cost is estimated at $400,000. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nADB\u2019s TA funding program. A detailed cost estimate is provided in Appendix 2.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB is the executing agency for the TA and will coordinate implementation of the TA \nclosely with resident missions and sector divisions. The five ministries involved will establish \nworking groups or task forces consisting of social sector staff from the central and provincial \nlevels and representatives of local government organizations and civil society. These working ", "  5\ngroups will coordinate work planning and analytical work under the guidance of a nominated \nsenior government official (state secretary equivalent); will coordinate with other key ministries, \nincluding those responsible for financial and economic affairs, decentralization, and planning; \nand will organize field work and field visits in consultation with provincial and district governors \nand other community-level representatives. This model will build on the successful approach \nadopted under TA 6089. \n \n15.  The TA will also liaise closely with other complementary ADB and DMC activities in a \nnumber of countries and sectors, including (i) the results-oriented and program-based social \naction  program  and  decentralization  activities  in  Pakistan;  (ii)  the  sectorwide  management \napproach to education reform in Indonesia; and (iii) the broader governance and financial \nmanagement reform program in Cambodia, Indonesia, and Mongolia. Expectations are that \nspecific MfDR instruments for education in Cambodia and Mongolia will also be introduced into \nhealth ministry approaches in these two countries. In addition, interregional and intercountry \nconsultative committees that include both ADB and country representatives will ensure that \nknowledge management and transfer processes related to MfDR are effective, including the \npreparation of a regional MfDR synthesis paper.  \n \n16.  The TA will require up to 10 person-months of individual international consulting services \nand up to 27 person-months of individual domestic consulting services in line with agreed work \nplans in each country. The TA will take place on an intermittent basis for a period of 18 months \nfrom May 2005 through October 2006. The working groups in the three countries will be active \nand operational throughout the period and will carry out follow-up work pertaining to work \nprograms agreed on at national workshops.  \n \n17.  ADB will engage all consultants as individuals in accordance with its Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants by the Asian Development Bank and Its Borrowers and other arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. Outline terms of reference for \nthe consultants are in Appendix 3. The terms of reference and the outlines for the country \ndecentralization studies and the synthesis paper will be fine-tuned based on feedback from the \nsocial sector agencies in Cambodia, Indonesia, and Mongolia following the Inception Mission.  \n \n18.  The TA will include a comprehensive dissemination plan, including (i) exchange visits \nand  conference  participation;  (ii)  web  sites  of  three  ministries  and  ADB\u2019s  web  site;  (iii) \ninformation brochures; and (iv) synthesis paper on decentralization and MfDR in the social \nsectors. \n \nIV.
