The  main  policy \ninstrument in the power sector is the National Electricity Policy, \nwhich  calls  for  power  for  all  by  2012  (including  rural \nelectrification),  reduced  aggregate  technical  and  commercial \nlosses, better cost recovery, greater private sector participation, \nfull development of hydropower, use of information technology for \ngreater  operational  efficiencies,  and  protection  of  consumers\u2019 \ninterests.  \n \nThe Electricity Act, 2003 (the Act) is the cornerstone legislation for \nthe power sector, providing the legal framework for the efficient \ndevelopment of the sector. The act is concerned primarily with \nunbundling  of  state  electricity  boards,  open  access,  and \ncompetition. The act also mandates full metering for all consumer \nclasses, multiyear tariff determinations, and tariffs set within 20% \nof the deemed cost of supply, as well as availability-based tariffs \nand 100% rural electrification.  \n \nReform  of  the  Madhya  Pradesh  (MP)  power  sector  has \nprogressed within the policy and legislative framework of India. \nThe Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) has demonstrated \nits commitment to reforms and has made encouraging progress. \nIn December 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved \nthe Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Program that \ncombined program lending with physical investment financing that \naddressed key reform areas. It also increased delivery capacity of \nthe power sector, including substantial reduction in transmission \nlosses.  \n \nWith substantial support from ADB\u2019s program loan, restructuring \nof  the  power  sector  was  completed.  Five  companies  were \nestablished for generation, transmission, and distribution. GOMP \n   ", "ii   \nachieved  a  comprehensive  financial  restructuring  that  included \ninjecting  equity  and  taking  over  loan  arrears  in  lieu  of  rural \nelectrification loans and subsidies. Transmission losses, targeted \nthrough physical investments, were reduced to an internationally \nacceptable  level.  Throughout  the  reform  process,  the  MP \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission  (MPERC)\u2014an  independent, \nstate-level regulatory agency\u2014adopted a realistic and supportive \nposition through its regulatory mechanisms.  \n \nTo facilitate economic growth by increasing electricity supply to its \nurban  and  rural  population,  GOMP  conducted  a  diagnostic \nassessment of earlier reforms and physical investments. Based \non the diagnostic work, the challenges in the power sector can be \nsummarized as follows:  \n \nGeneration.  MP has suffered from chronic peak capacity and \nenergy shortages in recent years. The peak deficit has exceeded \n20% and the energy deficit consistently has been about 13% for \nthe past 3 years. Installed capacity in or available to MP is about \n6,300 MW, with about 3,000 MW owned and operated by the \ngenerating company. Generating capacity available to meet peak \ndemand is significantly less than required to eliminate the energy \ndeficit. Therefore, new physical investments, as well as renovation \nand modernization of existing generating facilities, are essential. \n \nTransmission.  Since  2002,  transmission  circuit  length  has \nincreased almost 14%, while transformation capacity has risen \n41%. Transmission losses have been reduced to an acceptable \nlevel of about 5%, and availability of the transmission network has \nexceeded  98%  for  the  past  year.  However,  due  to  continued \ngrowth  in  demand,  the  transmission  capacity  is  inadequate  to \nserve peak demand. During 2006, the transmission system served \nthe highest ever maximum demand of 5,780 MW. Peak demand is \nexpected  to  grow  on  average  at  about  9%  to  2012.  The \ntransmission network will require significant investment if capacity \nis to be increased to match this forecast demand growth.  \n \nDistribution. GOMP policy targets 100% village electrification by \n2008 and 100% household electrification by 2012. The distribution \nnetwork needs significant investment to reach these targets. Loss \nreduction  and  reliability  improvement  are  also  sector  policy \nimperatives for the distribution subsector. Losses for distribution \ncompanies  exceed  35%,  and  power  quality  is  poor  due  to \nundersized conductors, long low-voltage circuits, and overloading \nof distribution transformers.  \n \nPrivate  Sector  Participation.  GOMP recognizes the need for \nfurther  private  sector  participation  to  meet  the  sector\u2019s  overall \nfinancing requirements and to enhance operational efficiencies. \nThrough implementation of power sector reforms under the ADB-\nfinanced Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Program ", "  iii\n(2001), GOMP has created the enabling environment for private \nsector  participation  and  public-private  partnerships  (PPP). \nHowever, private sector contributions have been slow to develop. \nThe financial fragility of the sector is perceived to be the key \nimpediment to private investment. Opportunities for private sector \ninvolvement include (i) electricity generation from renewable and \nnonrenewable resources, (ii) transmission network ownership and \nleasing, (iii) further distribution network franchising and leasing, \n(iv) bilateral electricity trading, and (v) maintenance contracting. \nPilot  distribution  system  franchising  schemes  have  been \nimplemented, and some minor maintenance functions have been \noutsourced. In generation, GOMP has proposals for independent \npower  producer  thermal  projects  in  the  next  5  years  with  a \ncombined  capacity  of  12,000  MW,  although  the  number  of \nprojects implemented is expected to be a small subset of this \ntotal.   \n \nCapacity  Constraints.  ADB\u2019s  2001  program  loan  included  a \ncapacity  development  component  to  address  the  policy \nenvironment.  This  assistance  was  successful,  and  GOMP  has \ndemonstrated the capacity to formulate and execute sector policy \nsince  2001.  However,  the  diagnostic  assessment  by  GOMP \ndemonstrated technical, commercial, financial, and management \nconstraints  in  the  new  power  sector  companies.  Key  areas \nidentified  include  design  and  implementation  of  a  \u201cbackbone\u201d \nenterprise  resource  planning  system  covering  (i)  billing  and \ncollection;  (ii)  finance  and  accounting;  (iii)  metering  data \nmanagement,  (iv)  management  information  systems;  (v) \nmaintenance  management;  (vi)  materials  management;  (vii) \nproject  systems;  (viii)  human  resources  and  e-mail  solutions, \ntogether with the appropriate network infrastructure and support. \nCapacity development also is required to improve the companies\u2019 \ninternal audit and control capability.  \n \nThe  constraint  being  addressed  through  a  comprehensive \nfunctional support and capacity-building program. ADB and the \nDepartment for International Development of the United Kingdom \n(DFID) are partnering in capacity development. ADB and DFID \njointly have supported the MP power sector since the initial stage \nof reforms. DFID is providing \u00a318.5 million $35.2 million as of 21 \nSeptember  2006)  in  technical  assistance  (\u00a314.5  million)  and \nfinancial assistance (\u00a34million) covering 2006\u20132010. The DFID \nprogram under implementation across the sector emphasizes (i) \nmapping  further  reforms  by  supporting  GOMP,  (ii)  capacity \nbuilding in MPERC, and (iii) financial management and human \nresources  development  in  all  companies.  In  addition  to  these \nprincipal areas of work, socioeconomic impact studies also are \nbeing conducted.  \n \nADB has included an additional $10 million under the investment \nprogram  for  a  selective  capacity  development  program.  This \n ", "iv   \nprogram  focuses  on  implementation  support  of  Supervisory \nControl and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in the distribution \ncompanies; and development of a trading and settlements support \nsystem,  metering,  and  communications  for  the  new  trading \ncompany, whose future role is pivotal in the effective commercial \noperation  of  the  reformed  sector.  In  addition,  ADB\u2019s  capacity \ndevelopment program will support energy efficiency activities and \nstrategic PPP.  \n   \nSector Road Map and  Key constraints, challenges, and opportunities identified through \nInvestment Program  diagnostic work paved the way for defining a strategic framework, \nDescription  a new sector strategy, and action plans over the short to medium \n  term.  The  action  plans  are  sequenced  and  complement \ntransactions involving the private and public sectors. These are \nencapsulated in a medium-term sector road map (2007\u20132012). \nThe sector road map is linked to a comprehensive investment \nprogram  covering  physical  investments  and  nonphysical \ninterventions  in  further  sector  reforms,  capacity  development, \nfiduciary  oversight  and  governance,  knowledge  management, \nsafeguards, procurement, disbursements, project implementation, \nevaluation, supervision, monitoring, and reporting. \n \nPhysical  Investments.  Reserve  Bank  of  India  forecasts  a \nsignificant improvement in MP\u2019s economic performance from 2007 \nto 2012, which is expected to drive strong growth in demand for \nelectricity. The objective of full household electrification by 2012 is \nexpected to generate further growth in electricity demand. Based \non  consistent  growth  in  the  national  and  state  economy,  and \nmoderate increases in tariffs to bring them in line with the true \ncost of supply, unrestricted consumer demand for electricity in MP \nis forecast to increase by 7% from 2007 to 2012. With energy \nlosses  currently  at  about  41%,  more  than  6,000  MW  of  peak \ngeneration and network capacity will have to be added over the \nnext 5 years to serve this demand.  \n \nA coherent and realistic state and regional plan for expansion of \ngeneration capacity is in place with contributions from public and \nprivate financial resources. The need to transmit an additional \n6,000 MW of peak power is the main driver of the investment \nprogram  for  the  transmission  and  distribution  systems.  The \ninvestment program is predicated on building sufficient capacity to \nevacuate power from existing and planned power stations and \nsubstations,  and  delivering  power  reliability  and  efficiency  to \nconsumers. It also targets significant reductions in technical and \ncommercial  losses,  reducing  the  requirement  for  additional \ncapacity by more than 1,000 MW and returning to a capacity and \nenergy surplus by 2011.  \n \nThe total investment program for the power sector is estimated to \nbe  $5.3  billion  (2007\u20132012),  with  $3.0  billion  needed  for \ntransmission  and  distribution.  The  financing  plan  involves  the ", "  v\nstate  government  budget,  as  well  as  the  private  sector  and \ninstitutions such as ADB. \n \nIn this context, India requested ADB support for the investment \nprogram in the form of a multitranche financing facility (MFF). \nSuch  support  provides  a  platform  for  financial  and  expert \nassistance,  blending  reform  and  capacity  development  with \ninvestments. ADB support will be extended for the transmission \nand  distribution  segments  of  the  sector  since  a  joint  venture \nbetween  state  and  central  power  utilities,  private  sector \ninvestments,  and  central-level  generating  projects  (e.g.,  ultra \nmega power projects) are planned to eliminate the generation \ndeficit. The impact of the transmission component will be further \nreductions  in  losses  and  increased  capacity  for  electricity \ntransmission to meet forecast demand growth. The impact of the \ndistribution component will be reduced technical and nontechnical \nlosses, improved voltage profiles, power quality and reliability, and \nmore efficient revenue collection. \n \nThe  project  component  of  the  earlier  ADB  loan  covered  the \ntransmission and distribution subsectors. The program component \nassisted  GOMP  in  (i)  implementing  key  policy  reforms  and \nestablishing  a  policy  framework,  including  a  fully  operational, \nindependent  state  regulatory  commission;  (ii)  unbundling  the \nMPSEB  into  five  companies;  (iii)  improving  sector  governance \nthrough  more  functional  independence;  and  (iv)  restructuring \ntariffs and issuing new tariff orders that allow revenue realization. \nRemaining policy issues are currently being addressed.  \n \nThe Investment Program will be a logical replication of the project \ncomponent of the previous ADB loan, covering transmission and \ndistribution  subsectors  by  taking  into  account  the  interrelated \nnature of the subsectors. Subprojects are designed in a repeater \nnature in the transmission and distribution subsectors, and one \nset of project from each subsector is presented in the Report and \nRecommendation of the President. The executing agencies (EAs) \nhave  gained  substantial  experience  from  implementing  the \nprevious ADB project.  \n \nThe MFF is particularly well suited for the Investment Program \nbecause  (i)  the  aim  of  the  Investment  Program  is  to  support \nGOMP\u2019s long-term objectives, as stated in the sector road map; \n(ii) the performance of the previous loan can guide the provision of \nsubsequent  loans,  thereby  offering  proper  incentives  for \nimplementation; and (iii) the MFF can offer the flexibility required \nfor the Investment Program to support the participation of four \ncompanies with different levels of readiness.   \n \nNonphysical  Investments.  ADB  is  providing  $10  million  for \ncapacity development in various areas to maximize the synergy \nwith  the  DFID-funded  capacity  development  program.  ADB\u2019s \n ", "vi   \ncapacity  development  program  will  focus  on  implementation \nsupport of SCADA systems in the distribution companies; and \ndeveloping a trading and settlements support system, metering, \nand communications for the new trading company, whose future \nrole  is  pivotal  in  the  effective  commercial  operation  of  the \nreformed sector. In addition, nonphysical investments will provide \nsubstantial  support  for  the  establishment  of  (i)  an  energy \nconservation  fund  and  other  energy  efficiency  initiatives  (e.g., \nClean Development Mechanism); and (ii) strategic PPP with the \nintention of achieving the requisite reduction in distribution losses \nand improving the quality of service to consumers.  \n   \nSector Investment and  Table 1: Power Sector Financing Plan, 2007\u20132012 \nFinancing Plan  Investment Program 2007\u20132012  $ Million  % \nInvestments     \n  Generation       2,300   43.1 \n  Transmission       1,400   26.2 \n  Distribution       1,600   30.0 \n  Nonphysical Investments            40   0.7 \nTotal Investments       5,340   100.0 \nFinancing Sources     \n  Domestic Financial Institutions   2,585   48.8 \n  Asian Development Bank   620   11.6 \n  Department for International Development , UK   35   0.7 \n  Private Investors   700   13.1 \n  Internal Funds   800   15.0 \n  Government of Madhya Pradesh   600   11.2 \nTotal Funding   5,340   100.0 \n Sources: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nTable 2: Transmission and Distribution Financing Plan, 2007\u20132012 \nFinancing Sources     $ Million  % \n  Domestic Financial Institutions     1,345   44.8 \n  Asian Development Bank     620   20.7 \n  Department for International Development, UK     25   1.2 \n  Private Investors     100   3.3 \n  Internal Funds     610   20.0 \n  Government of Madhya Pradesh     300   10.0 \nTotal Funding      3,000   100.0 \nSources: Asian Development Bank estimates \n   \nMultitranche Financing  India has asked ADB to extend financing of $620 million (included \nFacility  in the Country Operations Business Plan 2007-2009) over 8 years \nthrough an MFF for its power sector investment program. This \nfinancing represents 11.6% of the total financing plan and 20.7% \nof  the  financing  plan  for  the  transmission  and  distribution \nsegment. The MFF will allow financing of individual subprojects, \nas projects and conditions warrant, by linking financing to project \nreadiness, reforms, capacity, and work on various themes. The \ntentative  implementation  schedule  of  the  MFF  envisages  five \ntranches  covering  transmission,  distribution,  and  nonphysical ", "  vii\ninvestments.  Due  diligence  in  key  areas,  such  as  technical, \neconomic,  financial,  and  safeguards,  has  been  completed  for \nTranche 1 and Tranche 2. It is underway for further tranches.  \n   \nFramework Financing  India has entered into a financing framework agreement (FFA) \nAgreement  with  ADB.  The  FFA  satisfies  the  requirements  established  in \nAppendix 4 of the Pilot Financing Instruments and Modalities.  \n \nThe FFA records the full set of warranties and representations of \nADB  operating  policies  and  procedures  on  all  crosscutting \nthemes,  covering  safeguards,  governance,  anticorruption, \nfinancial  management,  procurement,  and  disbursement  and \nsubproject selection criteria. \n \nBefore ADB accepts a Periodic Financing Request (PFR), India, \nMP, and sector companies will ensure full compliance with the \nterms  and  conditions  of  the  FFA.  The  capacity  development \ncomponent  will  provide  support  if  necessary.  ADB  teams  will \nevaluate all funding requests, and will ensure that they adhere to \nrepresentations made and will continue to do so. ADB teams will \nprovide ongoing guidance to the authorities, and make available \nadditional experts under the capacity development component, if \nneeded.  ADB  staff  will  inform  the  Government  of  India  (the \nGovernment), and report to Management, and the Board on the \nstatus of individual loans, including the performance on warranties \nand  representations.  Failure  to  comply  with  any  of  these \nautomatically will hold back additional financing under the MFF. \n   \n \n \nPeriodic Financing  The  MFF  transaction  is  accompanied  by  two  PFRs,  one  for \nRequests  Tranche 1 for transmission components and another for Tranche \n2 for distribution components that are ready for implementation.  \n \nPFR  1,  Transmission  Capacity  Expansion.  This  component \nincludes construction of (i) 2 circuit kilometers (cct-km) of 400  \nkilovolt (kV) and about 1,500 cct-km of 220 kV transmission lines \nacross the state of MP; (ii) eight new 220/132 kV substations, with \ntransformer capacity of 160 megavolt-ampere (MVA) each; and \n(iii) one new 400/220/132 kV substation with 315 MVA transformer \ncapacity.  \n \nPFR 2, Distribution Efficiency Enhancement. The distribution \ncomponent  will  undertake  (i)  construction  of  high-voltage \ndistribution  systems  in  six  distribution  circles  in  the  eastern \ndistribution zone of MP, including conversion of about 7,400 km of \nlow-voltage  lines  to  high-voltage  lines;  (ii)  remote  metering  of \nabout 2,000 industrial consumers; (iii) metering of about 250,000 \nconsumers; and (iv) renovation of the protection system at about \n100 substations.  \n   \n ", "viii  \nAmount and Terms  The MFF will provide up to $620 million, secured from the ordinary \ncapital resources of ADB, with final terms and conditions to be \nestablished under individual loan agreements based on prevailing \nADB policies.  \n \nPursuant to the FFA, the Government has submitted two PFRs to \nADB totaling $151 million for Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 to finance \ntransmission  and  distribution  subprojects.  Both  PFRs  are \npresented to the Board with the MFF and the FFA. Tranche 1 and \nTranche 2 loans will have a principal repayment period of 20 \nyears, not including a grace period of 5 years. However, each \nfuture tranche may be financed under terms different from the \nfinancing terms of previous or subsequent tranches. Financing will \nbe made available under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility. The Government can choose from \neligible currencies and interest rate regimes, which can change \nwith each loan. Currency and interest rate swaps will be made \navailable during the financing period. Repayment schedules can \nbe structured to satisfy the needs of individual loans.  \n \nEach tranche under the MFF would be at least $40 million, except \nfor the nonphysical investments component, which would have a \nminimum loan amount of $5 million.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Government will make loans available to GOMP on the same \nTerms  terms and conditions as the ones applicable to the Government. \nGOMP  will  onlend  to  sector  companies,  as  the  EA,  with  a  1 \npercentage  point  spread,  through  respective  onlending \nagreements. \n   \nRetroactive Financing  Retroactive financing may be possible under individual loans for \nexpenditures  incurred  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding loan agreement, with a ceiling of up to 20% of the \nloan amount, in accordance with the Board paper on Cost Sharing \nand  Eligibility  of  Expenditures  for  Asian  Development  Bank \nFinancing: A New Approach. The Government, GOMP, and EAs \nhave been informed that approval of advance procurement action \nand retroactive financing does not commit ADB to financing any of \nthe proposed subprojects. Each PFR will specify the nature of \nexpenditure if retroactive financing is requested. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 30 June 2015, with the last PFR submission by 31 December \n2010. \n   \nEstimated Project  31 December 2014. \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agencies and  The EAs will be Madhya Pradesh Power Transmission Company \nImplementation  Limited (TRANSCO), Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut \nArrangements  Vitaran Company Limited (DISCOM-C), Madhya Pradesh Poorv \nKshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited (DISCOM-E), Madhya ", "  ix\nPradesh  Paschim  Kshetra  Vidyut  Vitaran  Company  Limited \n(DISCOM-W), and the Madhya Pradesh Power Trading Company \nLimited (TRADECO). \n \n  The EAs will be guided by a coordinating committee chaired by \nthe  chairman  and  managing  director  of  TRANSCO,  who  has \nextensive  experience  at  major  project  delivery  and  loan \ndisbursement  through  an  earlier  ADB  loan.  This  approach  will \nensure the sharing of best practices within the state. The EA for \nthe energy efficiency component will be identified in the future. \n \nThe Government will be responsible for the implementation of the \nMFF and loans in accordance with the FFA and individual loan \nagreements. \n \nThe  Energy  Department  (ED)  of  GOMP  handles  overall \ninvestment  program  management  in  MP.  Based  on  national \npolicies, the Energy Department formulates state power sector \npolicies,  road  map,  and  long-term  investment  plan.  It  also  is \nresponsible for creating an enabling environment for private sector \ninvestment in the state. The ED will monitor and evaluate the \nimplementation of the approved investment program and report it \nto Ministry of Power. \n \nMPERC will take part in monitoring since it conducts due diligence \nfor all investment proposals and reviews detailed project reports \nfrom the state power companies or private sector before warrant \napproval.   \n \nOnce  an  investment  program  is  approved,  the  companies  will \nimplement  and  be  responsible  for  it.  They  also  will  oversee \nprofessionally and efficiently the investment operations planned \nover the next few years. The staff of all power sector companies \nhas acquired substantial experience, including management skills \nand systems in the previous ADB-financed project. Teams have \nbeen  set  up  to  conduct  best  practices  in  technical,  financial, \nproject management, procurement, and environmental and social \nsafeguards. Evaluation, monitoring, and reporting systems will be \npart of the work. \n   \nProcurement  Procurement to be financed under the MFF will be undertaken in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement  Guidelines,  (2006,  as \namended  from  time  to  time),  and  will  be  in  line  with  ADB\u2019s \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (e.g.,  environmentally \nresponsible procurement). International competitive bidding (ICB) \nwill be used for supply and construction of the facilities being \nfunded under the investment program (substations, transmission \nlines, equipment, and transformers, etc.). ICB will be utilized for \nsupply contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of or more than \n$1 million. Limited international bidding or national competitive \nbidding will be used for supply contracts estimated at $250,000\u2013\n ", "x   \n$1  million,  and  shopping  for  contracts  estimated  at  less  than \n$250,000.  Contract  packages  will  be  prepared  to  ensure \nmaximum competition under ICB.  \n   \nConsulting Services  Consultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended \nfrom  time  to  time).  Consulting  firms  will  be  chosen  through \ninternational  competition  using  the  quality-  and  cost-based \nselection method. Individual experts may be recruited following \nADB\u2019s procedures for engagement of individual consultants based \non resume submitted in response to specific terms of reference for \nthe assignment. \n   \nProject Benefits and  The MFF is designed to benefit all grid-connected consumers with \nBeneficiaries of the  adequate and reliable supply of electricity. This would support the \nFacility  Government\u2019s projections for growth in energy demand, as well as \nits plan to make affordable grid-based electricity supplies available \nto  the  entire  population  by  2012.  Substantial  investments  in \nrehabilitation,  augmentation,  and  expansion  of  the  power \ntransmission  system  will  increase  reliability  of  supply  to  the \nresidential,  agricultural,  commercial,  and  industrial  consumers \nwithin the state of MP. A secure and predictable electricity supply \nwill enable social and economic benefits to materialize, and will \nensure  improved  conditions  for  schools,  hospitals,  and  other \nsocial services. At the state level, the economic and financial cost \nof  supplying  electricity  will  be  reduced  by  directly  addressing \ninherent inefficiencies. \n \nThe  investment  program  will  enable  urban  and  rural  domestic \nconsumers  to  receive  a  supply  of  electricity  at  an  acceptable \nvoltage  level,  and  with  minimal  scheduled  and  unscheduled \noutages.  Rural  consumers  in  particular  will  see  a  significantly \nimproved electricity supply, unaffected by the lengthy scheduled \noutages that are currently experienced. This will have positive \noutcomes for educational and social activities, and will open up \nopportunities  for  energy-dependent  rural  enterprises.  Industrial \nand commercial consumers also will benefit from improved supply \nreliability and quality, thereby enhancing production and output \nand  reducing  equipment  failures.  In  addition,  the  investment \nprogram  will  create  short-term  and  long-term  employment \nopportunities and tax revenues. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  The  MFF  is  accompanied  by  some  risks,  particularly  cost \noverruns, commissioning delays, investment timing mismatches, \nand  stalled  sector  reforms.  Given  the  cost-plus  tariff  setting \nmechanism  employed  in  MP  and  in  other  Indian  states,  cost \noverruns can be passed through to consumers. If tariff increases \nare substantial, the demand growth upon which the investment \nprogram  is   predicated  could  be  constrained,  undermining  the ", "xi \n   \n  economic  and  financial  viability  of  investments.  This  risk  is \ndeemed  to  be  small.  Cost  projections  are  thorough  and \nconservative, and have been based on a basket of tender prices \nsubmitted over the past 12 months. Moreover, turnkey contracting \nwill be used where appropriate, thereby transferring a large part of \nprice  and  implementation  risk to turnkey contractors. Investment \n  components are interrelated to some extent. Benefits expected to \nflow from one component might be reduced if commission delays \nare experienced in other components. Such risk will be contained \nand  managed  through  contractual  mechanisms  that  include \nprovisions for liquidated damages when commissioning delays are \nthe fault of contractors. Sufficient slippage provision will be built \ninto  the  implementation  program  to  minimize  the  risk  of \ncommissioning  delays  outside  the  control  of  contractors. \nTRANSCO\u2019s experience in managing and disbursing major loans \nand capital programs provides further comfort. \nCapacity building and public policy reform are essential to the \nlong-term growth and sustainability of the sector. The risk of a \nslowdown or reversal in the reform process is very unlikely. The \nGovernment and GOMP remain committed to the reform process \nas a secure and reliable power supply is viewed as a key enabler \nfor economic growth and poverty reduction.  \n   \nWarranties and  MP has a well-defined power sector road map, a clear investment \nRepresentations  and  capacity  development  program,  and  the  people  and \ninstitutions to deliver on the objectives and targets. The provision \nof ADB finance through an MFF requires an agreement on key \nwarranties  and  representations,  which  are  intended  to  ensure \nprogram success. The FFA captures critical provisions for ADB \nfinancing, including (i) subproject eligibility criteria; (ii) selection, \nand implementation, capacity building, safeguards framework; (iii) \nprocurement  and  disbursement  procedures;  (iv)  financial \nmanagement  and  fiduciary  oversight;  (v)  monitoring, \nadministration, and reporting.  \n \nADB will provide direct support to the EAs responsible for program \nimplementation, from headquarters and through the India Resident \nMission. A program support office has been established that will \ncoordinate specific implementation tasks, including procurement, \nsubproject management, monitoring, and supervision. The office \nwill  comprise  professional,  experienced  staff,  especially  in  the \nareas  of  safeguards,  financial  management,  administration,  and \nreporting. Although an MFF can be a flexible instrument for the \nauthorities, its viability requires a strong local presence and quality \nresources allocated to implementation.   \n \nEach new financing request to be converted into a new loan will \nrequire an evaluation of the performance of the previous one. ADB \nwill  conduct  periodic  review  missions,  which  will  include  due \ndiligence  on  warranties  and  representations  made  to  ADB.  In \naddition, staff will report on any issues or problems faced by the \nauthorities  and  the  EAs  under  the  program,  and  the  remedial \nactions suggested to overcome them. \n   ", "", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \nmultitranche financing facility (MFF) to India for the Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Investment \nProgram (Investment Program). Design and Monitoring Framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  Background, Performance Indicators, and Analysis \n2.  India faces formidable challenges in achieving balanced infrastructure development, \nwhere the provision of adequate energy plays an essential role in reducing poverty through \nsustainable economic growth. The Government of India (the Government) has confirmed its \n\u201cPower for All\u201d initiative to provide universal power supply by 2012, which will require 100,000 \nmegawatt (MW) of new generation capacity and related transmission and distribution facilities. \nCognizant of the vast impact on the global environment and energy security, the Government \ndeveloped  the  Integrated  Energy  Policy1.  The  policy  encapsulates  the  vision  to  meet  the \ndemand for energy services of all sectors reliably with safe, clean, and convenient energy in a \ntechnically  efficient,  economically  viable,  and  environmentally  sustainable  manner.  The \nIntegrated Energy Policy provides for specific measures, including (i) optimizing the power \nsupply mix through greater use of indigenous hydropower resources and renewable energy; (ii) \npursuing  technologies  that  maximize  energy  efficiency,  demand-side  management,  and \nconservation;  and  (iii)  continuing  related  power  sector  reforms  to  control  technical  and \ncommercial  losses  of the  state  transmission and  distribution  utilities,  with  the  restructuring \nsupported by the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Program.  \n \n3.  The past poor performance of state electricity boards was a roadblock to private sector \ninvestment. In 2001, the Government adopted a program of unbundling, open access, tariff \nrestructuring, and rationalization. An independent central regulatory body was established, and \nthe formation of state-level regulatory bodies was made mandatory. The Electricity Act, 2003 \nwas  intended  to  improve  governance  in  the  power  sector  through  continued  institutional \nrestructuring and improved management of sector entities to ensure long-term sustainability. \nCompulsory metering, open access to transmission systems, facilitation of power trading, lifeline \ntariff  for  the  poor  and  rural  consumers  and  rationalization  of  tariffs  have  been  initiated. \nSeparation of generation, transmission, and distribution has been made obligatory. The Central \nElectricity  Regulatory  Commission  has  prescribed  detailed  rules  for  cost  accounting  and \nallowable tariffs. Further, the Electricity Act, 2003 mandated full metering for all consumer \nclasses, multiyear tariffs (MYT), tariffs to be within 20% of the deemed cost of supply by 2012, \navailability-based tariffs, and 100% rural electrification. \n \n4.  Power sector reforms (Appendix 2) in Madhya Pradesh (MP), which began in 2001, \nreceived additional impetus from the Electricity Act, 2003, and have accelerated in the past two \nyears. The government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) has demonstrated its commitment to \nreforms and has made encouraging progress. In December 2001, the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB) approved the Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Program (MPPSDP), which \nhad a $150 million program component and a $200 million project component. The objectives of \nthe  program  component  were  to  (i)  establish  independent  regulation,  (ii)  improve  sector \ngovernance through institutional and organizational actions, (iii) establish and begin operations \nof new sector companies, (iv) reduce system losses, and (v) increase the delivery capacity of \nthe power system. With substantial support from ADB\u2019s program loan, unbundling has been \n                                                 \n1   Planning Commission, Government of India, 2006. Integrated Energy Policy. India \n   ", "2   \ncompleted, all sector companies have been given cost-reflective tariffs that will gradually move \nto full cost recovery, and capacity is being developed in all companies to operate in the evolving \ncommercial and competitive sector.  \n \n5.  Following the unbundling of the Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board (MPSEB), five \npower sector companies have been incorporated: MP Power Generating Company Limited \n(GENCO),  MP  Power  Transmission  Company  Limited  (TRANSCO),  and  three  distribution \ncompanies (DISCOMs2). GENCO has been vested with MP\u2019s electricity generation assets and \nhas taken over their operation. TRANSCO has become the sole transmission company in the \nstate.  The  three  DISCOMs  have  taken  over  the  distribution  and  supply  activities  in  three \ngeographic areas (east, central, and west). In June 2005, the companies started to operate \nindependently. The formation of the MP Power Trading Company Limited (TRADECO) was \nannounced in June 2006 for the bulk procurement of electricity from generators in order to sell \nto  DISCOMs.  All  power  purchase  agreements  for  which  MPSEB  was  the  purchasing \ncounterparty have been transferred to TRADECO. To provide an avenue for sector companies \nto reach financial sustainability, GOMP undertook sector financial restructuring that included \ninjecting equity and taking over loan arrears in lieu of rural electrification loans and subsidy \narrears in 2005\u20132006. MPSEB will remain in place until the successor entities have built enough \ncapacity to handle their own corporate affairs and financial management.  \n \n6.  Throughout the reform process, the MP Electricity Regulatory Authority (MPERC), an \nindependent,  state-level  regulatory  agency  formed  in  1999,  has  adopted  a  realistic  and \nsupportive position through its regulatory mechanisms. In 2001, it issued its first tariff orders \n(Supplementary Appendix A) for all sector companies\u2014offtake tariffs for GENCO, allowable \ncosts and returns for TRANSCO, and uniform retail tariffs for DISCOMs. In September 2002, \nMPERC introduced a time-of-day tariff applicable to some classes of consumers. Between 2001 \nand 2004, a single 1-year tariff was ordered. In the revised tariff philosophy of December 2003, \nMPERC proposed to determine a full-cost tariff for all consumer categories with the objective of \nensuring that the sector companies receive enough income to cover expenditures and provide a \nreasonable return on assets. In March 2006, MPERC passed the first MYT orders for generation \nand transmission covering 2007\u20132009. However, the distribution retail tariff order still covered a \nsingle year, 2007. The first multiyear retail tariff will cover 2008\u20132010. DISCOMs filed MYT \napplications on 31 October 2006 to be effective as on 1 April 2007.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n7.  The  Government\u2019s  and  GOMP\u2019s  main  objective  for  the  power  sector  is  increasing \nelectricity supply to its urban and rural population to facilitate economic growth. Based on \ndiagnostic  work  undertaken  by  GOMP,  achieving  this  objective  in  MP  faces  the  following \nchallenges (Appendix 3):  \n \n1.  Sector Constraints  \n8.  Generation. Installed capacity in or available to MP is about 6,300 MW, with about \n3,000 MW owned and operated by GENCO. Less than 100 MW of net installed generating \ncapacity has been added in MP in the past 5 years. However, plant utilization has increased \nfrom 63% in 2002 to more than 70% in 2006, which has helped in meeting the growth in energy \ndemand during this period. Electricity demand is estimated to have grown at an average of 5% \n                                                 \n2 Madhya Pradesh Madhya Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited (DISCOM-C), Madhya Pradesh Poorv Kshetra \nVidyut Vitaran Company Limited (DISCOM-E), Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Limited \n(DISCOM-W). \n ", "3 \nover the same period, whereas actual sales have increased by more than 7% on average. The \nsupply-demand balance is now critical. MP has suffered from chronic peak capacity and energy \nshortages  in  recent  years.  The  peak  deficit  has  exceeded  20%  and  the  energy  deficit \nconsistently has been about 13% for the past 3 years. Annual energy demand is estimated to \nexceed supply by more than 13% in 2007, and is forecast to grow by approximately 7% through \n2012. \n   \n9.  Investments in capacity are planned to remove the peak deficit by 2012. The bulk of \nplanned generation capacity expansion will be coal-fired thermal plants, reflecting the availability \nof coal to MP, relatively short project development cycle, and low development risk of coal-fired \nplants.  Approximately  800  MW  of  additional  hydropower  capacity  is  planned,  primarily  as \npeaking plants. Development of planned generation expansion will be shared equally by the \nstate, central, and private sectors. The current portfolio of MP state projects, which are under \nconstruction or in the planning phase, are all thermal-based. These are expected to increase the \ninstalled capacity by approximately 700 MW by the end of 2007. Private sector contributions will \ncome through competitively bid and greenfield projects. Private sector projects are expected to \nbe predominantly coal-fired thermal plants. MP will receive an allocation from the central sector \nand joint venture hydropower and thermal projects that are in development, including the 500 \nMW Omkareshwar hydropower project. MP also will receive an allocation of approximately 400 \nMW  of  new  capacity  from  the  Kawas  and  Gandhar  gas-based  projects.  In  addition,  the \nGovernment is developing ultra mega power projects under tariff-based competitive bidding. \nThese  projects  will  meet  the  power  needs  of  some  states,  including  MP,  through  the \ntransmission of power regionally and nationally. MP has consented to take 12,000 MW based \non the power securing agreement with the Ministry of Power. \n \n10.  Transmission. Since 2002, transmission circuit length has increased almost 14%, while \ntransformation capacity has risen 41%. Consequently, transmission losses have been reduced \nto an acceptable level of about 5%, and availability of the transmission network has exceeded \n98% for the past year. However, transmission capacity within MP is inadequate to serve peak \ndemand due to continued growth in demand. An (n-1) security level is used for transmission \nplanning.3  Investment  in  the  transmission  network  has  not  matched  the  consistently  high \ndemand growth in recent years, which means that supply security is significantly less than (n-1) \nfor parts of the transmission network\u2014in other words failure of a major network component \nmight necessitate load shedding. \n \n11.  Distribution.  In  broad  terms,  the  distribution  system  is  the  primary  bottleneck  in \nelectricity delivery in MP. It is characterized by high ratios of Low Voltage (LV) circuit length to \nMedium Voltage (MV) circuit length (about 64% in central and east zones, and 47% in west \nzone), overloaded power transformers (20% of all power transformers were overloaded at some \nstage in 2005), and overloaded distribution transformers (10% of all distribution transformers \nwere overloaded at some stage in 2005). By most measures, the MP distribution system suffers \nfrom such a severe capacity shortage that it is incapable of providing adequate quality and \nreliability of supply to all customers. Safety is compromised on the networks of the three \nDISCOMs  due to shoddy installation of equipment and  inadequate maintenance practices. \nLosses arising from poorly executed connections at distribution transformers exceed standards.  \n \n2.  System Losses \n12.  The high network losses (Supplementary Appendix B ) are a pressing energy efficiency \nissue for MP. Previous investments have successfully targeted transmission losses, which are \n                                                 \n3  Supply can be maintained to all customers with the outage of one major item of equipment. \n ", "4   \nnow about 5%. As this is a reasonable level for a transmission network, only minor further \nimprovements are anticipated. Distribution network losses in many areas are 40%\u201345%, which \nis  unacceptably  high.  Comparing  the  DISCOMs  with  a  notional  international  benchmark \ndistribution network indicates that\u2014after correction for different system characteristics, load \nfactor, and energy supplied\u2014a reasonable target for technical distribution losses in MP is about \n19%.  DISCOMs  and  MPERC  have  agreed  on  loss  reduction  targets,  which  form  part  of \ndistribution tariff determinations. DISCOMs will be penalized financially if they fail to achieve \nthese targets, and will be rewarded if they exceed the targets. The distribution component of the \nMFF will address losses, among other things. The high-voltage distribution system (HVDS) \nsubproject in particular will impact directly technical and nontechnical losses. Other measures, \nsuch as consumer and distribution transformer metering, will help in identifying and isolating \nlosses. As a result, MPERC will be able to more accurately measure and report on the technical \nperformance of DISCOMs. Incorrect and manipulated meter reading for high-value customers is \nsuspected of causing significant commercial losses, and remote metering of these customers \nwill address the issue.  \n \n3.  Private Participation \n13.  Through its National Electricity Policy (NEP)4, and in keeping with open access and \nother provisions in the Electricity Act, 2003, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has stated \nthat private participation in the sector is desirable and is to be encouraged. GOMP has been \ncognizant of the need for further private sector participation to meet the sector\u2019s financing \nrequirements and to enhance operational efficiencies. ADB and GOMP has continued policy \ndialogue  since  processing  the  MPPSDP  in  2001,  and  agreed  that  further  private  sector \nparticipation would be a critical medium-term objective. Through implementation of power sector \nreforms  under  MPPSDP,  GOMP  has  created  enabling  environments  for  private  sector \nparticipation and public-private partnerships (PPP). In 2005, MPERC defined the terms and \nconditions for intrastate open access in MP with the intention of further enabling private sector \nparticipation in the generation and retail subsectors (Supplementary Appendix C). Despite these \ninitiatives, the private sector is not yet playing a major role in the MP power sector. The financial \nfragility of the sector is perceived to be the main impediment to private investments. ADB\u2019s \nintervention has the potential improve the sector\u2019s financial viability, so that the private sector \nincreasingly will see investment reward as commensurate with risk and will begin to participate \nas intended under federal and state policy. \n \n14.  In generation, GOMP has proposals for independent power producer thermal projects in \nthe next 5 years with a combined capacity of 12,000 MW, although the number of projects \nimplemented is expected to be a small subset of this total. The first project is in the bidding \nphase, and 15 private investors have been short-listed. In addition, further opportunities in \nrenewable energy generation\u2014small to medium hydroelectric, wind, and biomass\u2014abound. In \ntransmission,  opportunities  for  PPP  include  outsourcing  operation  and  maintenance.  In \ndistribution, DISCOMs are piloting franchising schemes for rural distribution systems. They also \nare exploring a strategic partnership schemes in urban distribution systems for achieving the \nrequisite  reduction  in  distribution  losses,  as  well  as  improving  the  quality  of  service  to \nconsumers. To this end, GOMP has started a scoping exercise with ADB involving potential \ninvestors and other stakeholders.   \n \n15.  Energy  efficiency  initiatives  are  another  area  where  PPPs  might  play  a  key  role \n(Supplementary Appendix C). The private sector is expected to participate in the establishment \nof an Energy Conservation Fund (ECF) as financier, fund operator, and financing recipient. The \n                                                 \n4 Ministry of Power. Government of India, 2005. National Electricity Policy. India. \n ", "5 \nECF could provide technical assistance for project development, as necessary. The fund also \ncould help finance revenue-generating energy efficiency projects implemented mainly by the \nprivate  sector  and  through  PPP  schemes,  Energy  Service  Company  (ESCOs),  power \ndevelopers, and other entities, including community-owned energy service providers. ADB\u2019s \ndirect participation would open the opportunity for additional credit enhancements in the form of \npartial  credit  guarantees,  and  cofinancing  from  new  carbon  and  energy  efficiency  funds \nexpected to be operational by 2007 and 2008. ADB participation in the fund also would add \nsubstantial value to the MFF proposal as it presents innovative financing, mobilizes private \nparticipation,  and  could  capitalize  on  carbon  credit  opportunities.  Design  and  operational \nprocedures of the ECF, which are mandated under the Energy Conservation Act 2001, will be \ndetailed following due diligence for Tranche 4 of the MFF.  \n \n4.  Financial Sustainability of the Sector \n16.  Achieving financial sustainability of the sector is a key objective of GOMP power sector \nreforms. Sustainability currently is undermined by energy inefficiency, specifically the level of \ntechnical and nontechnical losses in the distribution subsector. In addition to reducing these \nlosses, systematic billing and collection by distribution companies, payments of intercompany \nobligations, and timely remittance of subsidies by the Government are essential for the financial \nsustainability of the sector.  \n \n17.  Before the sector reforms, MPSEB\u2019s financial position was critical due to inadequate \ntariffs, nonremunerative investments in rural electrification schemes to meet social obligations, \ndelays  in  tariff  subsidy  from  GOMP,  and  high  commercial  and  technical  losses  in  the \ntransmission and distribution networks. To meet cash flow requirements, MPSEB has been \ndefaulting on payment obligations to its suppliers and lenders by reducing capital investments \nand pursuing suboptimal repair and maintenance practices. Following the unbundling of MPSEB \nin 2002, GOMP prepared a financial restructuring plan (FRP) with the objective of restoring the \nsector\u2019s financial sustainability. Sector companies began operating independently in June 2005. \nIn line with this, GOMP undertook financial restructuring of the sector, which included injecting \nequity and taking over loan arrears and rural electrification loans in lieu of subsidy arrears in \n2005\u20132006. GOMP is updating the FRP to reflect the results of the financial restructuring and to \nmap further reforms in the sector. However, shortfalls in sector revenues are likely to continue \nfor next 3 to 5 years as a result of high distribution losses. In this context, targeted loss-\nreduction investments are critical to bring the cost of supply in line with average retail tariffs by \nthe end of the Eleventh Plan (2008\u20132012), and to achieve sector profitability and eventually \nfinancial sustainability.   \n \n18.  GOMP continues to extend subsidies to various customer groups, such as domestic \nconsumers and small farmers (for irrigation). However, GOMP is reducing progressively the \nnumber of categories and the level of subsidies to be paid. Currently, power sector subsidies \nare reflected as a line item in the state budget. Sector companies collect development cess of \n10 paisa per kilowatt-hour (kWh) and electricity dues on behalf of GOMP. Rather than pass \nthese through to GOMP, they are set off against electricity tariff subsidies. In this way, subsidies \nare not paid upfront. Instead, the companies deduct subsidy payments before they remit the \ncash to the MPSEB.    \n \n19.  MPERC is determining tariffs in compliance with the NEP of CEA. The tariff orders \nsupport  the  rationalization  of  operating  costs  and  the  commercialization  of  overall  system \noperations. Most importantly, the tariff orders reflect the official viewpoint that electric power will \nbe provided on a cost-of-supply basis, and that all consumers will pay for electric service. Tariffs \ninclude consideration of good governance, financial sustainability, distributive justice, economic \n ", "6   \nefficiency, and fair pricing. They also are consistent with ADB guidance. In 2006, MPERC \npassed a distribution and retail tariff order for 2007, as well as the first MYT order for generation \nand transmission covering 2007\u20132009. MPERC allowed TRANSCO to base its tariff on full cost \nrecovery of loan capital, depreciation, return on equity, operation and maintenance expenses, \nadministrative and general expenses, repairs and maintenance expenses, interest on working \ncapital, MPERC fee, and income taxes. With the proper implementation of the tariff policy, \nTRANSCO  is  projected  to  maintain  profitability,  while  DISCOM-E  is  expected  to  achieve \nprofitability by 2008.  \n \n5.  Capacity Development \n20.  The  early  stages  of  reform  led  to  the  creation  of  successor  companies  that  have \nassumed  operating  responsibilities  for  generation,  transmission,  distribution,  and  recently \ntrading. They have inherited assets, liabilities, procedures, systems, and the work regime from \nMPSEB. Staff have been allocated to the new companies on an \u201cas is where is\u201d basis. Boards \nhave been appointed. Below this level, organization structures in the new companies have been \nevolving. Concerns have been raised that earlier efforts to contain costs in the loss-incurring \nMPSEB have led to shortages of skills in strategically significant disciplines and work areas. In \naddition,  sector  companies  in  the  transition  phase  face  resource  constraints  for  financial \nmanagement and reporting, as well as for enhancing their internal audit and control capability.  \n \n21.  Recognizing these constraints, GOMP included a $45 million nonphysical investment \ncomponent  for  capacity  development  to  support  physical  investments.  Department  for \nInternational Development of the United Kingdom (DFID) is providing assistance5 for further \ncapacity development, specifically in financial management, technical planning, and human \nresources development, as well as in commercial areas. DFID assistance, which will cover \n2006\u20132010, will complement ADB\u2019s physical investments included under the MFF. ADB also \nincluded an additional $10 million under the MFF for capacity development to support energy \nefficiency activities, such as the establishment of ECF and other energy efficiency initiatives, \ne.g., Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). The funds also will support information technology \nand management information systems (MIS)6 for TRADECO that are not covered under the \nDFID program. Since the initial stage of reforms, ADB and DFID have supported jointly the MP \npower sector.  \n \n22.  From 2002 to 2006, ADB (Supplementary Appendix D) helped GOMP (i) improve the \npolicy environment and governance of the sector, (ii) initiate the establishment of a commercial \nand competitive business environment to promote efficiency gains and loss reduction, and (iii) \nintroduce  a  computerized  information  and  revenue  management  system.  The  Canadian \nInternational Development Agency worked with ADB from 2002 to 2004, providing extensive \nsupport for the development of financial restructuring plans, as well as the assessment of \npension fund liabilities. From 2002 to 2005, DFID provided complementary support to the reform \nprocess through detailed needs assessments for accounting and information and technology \nsystems  for  the  successor  companies.  DFID\u2019s  capacity  development  assistance  covers  (i) \ndefining the commercial relation ships between sector companies, including market operation \nsupport during the transition to the new market mechanisms, energy billing arrangements, and \npreparation  of  PPAs;  (ii)  financial  management  through  setting  financial  policies,  cost  and \nrevenue centers, planning, modeling, controls, and reporting; (iii) accounting systems, including \n                                                 \n5  DFID is providing \u00a318.5 million in technical assistance (\u00a314.5 million) and financial assistance (\u00a34.0 million) from \n2006 to 2010. \n6  A needs assessment will be conducted to design the capacity building component for TRADECO. Therefore, this \ncomponent will be included in the third tranche that is scheduled for April 2008. \n ", "7 \nspecification of long-term accounting requirements and preparation of chart of accounts; (iv) \nhuman resource strategies, needs assessment, organizational structure, and development of \nrecruitment procedures and supporting mechanisms (e.g., job descriptions); (v) development, \nprocurement, and implementation of integrated MIS solutions, including components such as \nbilling,  accounting,  materials  management,  project  management,  asset  maintenance \nmanagement,  and  technical  applications;  and  (vi)  regulatory  support,  including  filing  tariff \napplications and interaction with MPERC.  DFID assistance also supports technical areas, such \nas distribution investment planning, facilitation of decentralization and standardization, load \nforecasting,  power  quality  and  reliability,  benchmarking,  and  equipment  standards  for  all \nDISCOMs and transmission investment planning studies to meet demand growth and open \naccess requirements for TRANSCO.  \n \n6.  Sector Road Map    \n23.  To overcome these challenges, GOMP has developed a sector road map linked to a \ncomprehensive investment program. The sector road map\u2019s objective is to establish the route to \nachieving the sustainable growth of the power sector in MP. The road map aims to deliver the \nfollowing outcomes: (i) strengthening power supply capacity to improve access to reliable and \naffordable electricity, (ii) enhancing efficiency and quality of power supply, and (iii) ensuring \nfinancial health of the power sector through continued power sector reform at the sector and \ncorporate levels. Based on the sector road map, the MP power sector needs an estimated $5.3 \nbillion in investments through to 2012. The largest component is generation, accounting for $2.3 \nbillion of planned investment (43%). This is followed by $1.6 billion for distribution, including \nrural electrification (30%), and $1.4 billion for transmission (26%). The investment program \nincludes  $40  million  for  a  comprehensive  capacity  building  program  to  meet  the  sector\u2019s \nincreasing management capacity requirements. The physical investments will address current \nunserved energy demand and provide additional capacity to meet forecast demand growth. The \ninstalled generating capacity of thermal and hydropower plants will be increased, while technical \nand  nontechnical  losses  will  be  reduced  through  enhanced  transmission  capacity  and  the \nadoption of more appropriate voltage levels for distribution. The need for load shedding also will \nbe reduced during peak demand periods (A matrix that summarizes the sector road map is in \nAppendix 1).  \n \n7.  Asian Development Bank\u2019s Strategy \n24.  Cognizant of the strong nexus between infrastructure and poverty reduction, ADB\u2019s \noverall assistance has taken a balanced infrastructure development approach, comprising road \nsystems, water transport, railways, hydrocarbons, and energy. Within the energy sector, the \ncountry strategy and program 2003\u20132006 (CSP) focused investment programs on clean energy \ndevelopment, including run-of-the-river hydropower projects, other forms of renewable energy, \nrural electrification, and energy efficiency improvements. Guided by the CSP, the 2004 and \n2005 CSP updates7 outlined six priorities of ADB\u2019s power sector assistance: (i) reforming the \npower sector, (ii) promoting higher efficiency and low-carbon power sources, (iii) expanding and \noptimizing transmission and distribution systems, (iv) strengthening institutions to implement \nreforms required by the 2003 Electricity Act, (v) promoting private sector participation, and (vi) \nencouraging energy conservation and ensuring environmental and social sustainability.  \n \n25.  Under  its  energy  efficiency  and  carbon  market  initiatives,  ADB  is  providing  a \ncomprehensive technical assistance program that began in 2005. The program includes: (i) \n                                                 \n7  ADB. 2004. Country Strategy and Program Update (2004\u20132006): India. Manila; ADB. 2005.

Manila. \n ", "8   \nCDM8, which provides capacity building for financial and municipal sectors, with an ultimate \ngoal of reducing greenhouse gasses through CDM projects; (ii) support the inception of the \nenergy efficiency initiative in developing member countries9 for country-level assessment of \nnear-term  energy  efficiency  opportunities  focusing  on  conservation  and  demand-side \nmanagement;  and  (iii)  assistance  for  renewable  energy  in  rural  areas  through  the  ADB \nRenewable Energy and Climate Change Program.  \n \n26.  ADB will continue to expand its promotion of and support for power sector reforms in \nother states. ADB also will intensify its efforts in the states where it is already active, such as \nAssam, Gujarat, MP, and Uttaranchal. The interventions will promote knowledge transfer in \nrelation to best practices in the international power sector, improve corporate governance in \nstate-owned utilities, and ensure that appropriate environmental and social safeguards are \nincorporated into new power sector investments. The proposed intervention in MP is consistent \nwith the strategy of supporting state-level sector reforms, in this case with the emphasis on the \ntransmission and distribution subsectors. \n \n8.  Lessons  \n27.  In the past, ADB extended assistance to discrete power projects in various states, as \nwell as to the central power sector agencies. Although this policy enabled ADB to support many \nprojects, it spread ADB\u2019s resources too thinly. As a result, ADB could not achieve fully its \ndesired goal of policy reforms with its power sector borrowers. In most states, the power sector \nwas the largest recipient of state resources in terms of subsidies and capital investments. India \nrecognized that macro management of the state\u2019s finances needed to be improved to turn \naround the power sector.     \n \n28.  Since  2000,  ADB  has  focused  its  lending  on  states  committed  to  reforming  and \nrestructuring  their  power  sectors  on  the  premise  that  improving  the  power  sector  toward \nfinancial sustainability will increase the ability of state governments to allocate resources for \npoverty reduction. In 2003, ADB conducted project performance audits of energy projects in \nIndia, which identified the following lessons: (i) ADB needs to be flexible and adaptable to \nchanging conditions in India, (ii) land acquisition should be carried out expeditiously to minimize \nimplementation delays, (iii) construction contracts should be properly packaged to facilitate \nimplementation and coordination, and (iv) loan covenants should be appropriate. These issues \nwere taken into consideration when selecting the subprojects, finalizing procurement packages, \nand  implementing  subprojects  under  the  ongoing  loan.  The  experience  is  reflected  in  the \npreparation of the proposed MFF, and ensured that these lessons are incorporated into MFF \ndesign and project preparedness criteria agreed between India and ADB.  \n \n9.  External Assistance \n29.  The  power  sector  in  India  has  received  assistance  from  various  international \ndevelopment partners (Appendix 4). The World Bank has been the major source of external \nfunding to the sector, focusing on reforms in generation, rehabilitation and improvement, and \ndevelopment  of  renewable  energy  resources.  The  United  States  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment has supported policy aspects of private sector participation, with studies on state \nsector  reforms,  and  has  provided  assistance  for  energy  management.  Kreditanstalt  f\u00fcr \n                                                 \n8 ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to India for Capacity Development for Clean Development Mechanism.

Japan  Bank  for \nInternational  Corporation  has  supported  the  expansion  of  public  sector  generation, \ntransmission, and distribution, including rural electrification. \n \n30.  ADB has been coordinating with other development partners to maximize the value of \nsector reforms and physical investments10. The Canadian International Development Agency \nworked with ADB from 2002 to 2004 on MP power sector reform, and has provided extensive \nsupport  for  development  of  financial  restructuring  plans,  reconfiguration  of  distribution \noperations,  and  assessment  of  pension  fund  liabilities.  DFID  has  provided  technical  and \nfinancial assistance for power sector restructuring in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Orissa, and \nWest Bengal, as well as in MP in cooperation with ADB.  \n \n10.  Policy Dialogue \n31.  Energy  Efficiency.  GOMP  is  aware  that  energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy \npotential  to  bridge  supply  gaps,  specifically  in  distributed  and  decentralized  generation \napplication, is substantially unrealized. Total potential of energy efficiency, renewable energy, \nand distributed and decentralized generation is roughly equivalent to current state-wide power \nimports. The main sources of this potential are conservation and demand-side management, \nsolar water heating and photovoltaic systems, wind power, small hydropower, biomass-biogas, \nand biofuels. Cofinancing of energy efficiency projects is possible through the Kyoto Protocol, \nsecond-tier  carbon  markets,  commercial  clean  energy  investment  funds,  and  the  global \nenvironment facility. The Energy Conservation Act 2001 mandates the creation of state-level \nECF.  GOMP  approved  on  26  September  2006  a  new  policy  for  unconventional  resource \ndevelopment, including directing 5% of the Rs0.10 per kWh cess on power sales into a state-\nlevel ECF to be created. MP will be among the first few states in India to create the ECF.11 \n32.  Cash Management. Sector cash management, in terms of revenues and payments, is \ncentralized  under  MPSEB.  Although  the  five  companies  are  operated  separately  and \nindependently, the revenues from their businesses are consolidated and utilized by MPSEB in \naccordance with a prescriptive cash flow mechanism. Priority is given to payment of salaries \nand  wages,  coal  and  oil  supplies,  power  purchases,  debt  service,  essential  operation  & \nmanagement expenses, and administrative and capital expenditures. The cash flow mechanism \nis expected to be retained until the sector is returned to profitability in 2011, according to \nprojections in the FRP. However, TRANSCO\u2019s projections show that it will make a profit, and \nwill be capable of meeting its own operating costs and debt repayments, in 2007. Similarly, \nDISCOMs\u2019 financial projections indicate that DISCOM-E will achieve profitability in 2009, while \nDISCOM-C and DISCOM-W are expected to reach that milestone in 2010 with only small \noperating  losses  in  2009.  Accordingly,  the  cash  flow  mechanism  could  be  discontinued \nbeginning 1 April 2008.  \n \n33.  Governance Measures. Companies are introducing an enterprise resource planning-\nbased procurement system, which will increase transparency, accountability, and efficiency in \nprocurement. Use of ADB guidelines on procurement and consulting services and standard \nbidding documents will provide an opportunity for better monitoring. Bid specifications and \npackaging will ensure maximum competition under international competitive bidding procedures. \n \n                                                 \n10 Appendix 4 provides further details.  \n11 Further details are discussed in para. 44. \n ", "10   \n34.  Recruitment  of  financial  management  experts  and  establishment  of  internal  control \nsystems supported with advanced information and communication technology-based financial \nmanagement systems will ensure efficiency and accountability. External auditors will audit the \nfinancial statements, which will be published regularly and reported to the shareholders and \nMPERC. Measurable financial performance indicators for each company will be set, evaluated, \nand benchmarked by MPERC. ADB review missions will have regular access to the executing \nagencies\u2019 (EA) accounting and control systems to monitor expenditures and other financial \ntransactions, and ensure safe custody of project-financed assets.  \n \n35.  The appointment of independent board members in the sector companies will clarify and \nenhance  their  role  as  custodians  of  stakeholder  interests.  Revisions  to  board  recruitment \nprocedures and establishment of board-level committees will encourage diversity and facilitate \nthe introduction of additional private sector expertise. The development of a formal code of \nconduct  for  board  members,  as  well  as  public  disclosure  of  operational  and  financial \nperformance of the sector entities on the MPERC web site, will ensure transparency in the \npower sector in MP. A summary of governance measures is in Table 1. \n \nTable 1: Governance Measures \nArea  Measure \nProcurement  \u2022  Use of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) guidelines on procurement and \nconsulting services. \n\u2022  Use of ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents and standard request for proposal \ndocuments for procurement and recruitment of consultants. \n\u2022  Bid specifications and packaging to be prepared to ensure maximum \ncompetition under international competitive bidding procedures. \n\u2022  Capacity development of sector entities on e-procurement to increase \ntransparency, accountability, and efficiency in procurement. \nFinancial  \u2022  Regular access to the Executing Agency\u2019s accounting and control systems to \nManagement  monitor expenditures and other financial transactions and safe custody of \nand Audit  project-financed assets.  \n\u2022  Capacity development of the sector companies in accounting and internal \ncontrol systems, financial management, and audit capabilities. \n\u2022  Expanded use of advanced information and communication technology-based \nfinancial management systems will ensure efficient and accountability. \n\u2022  External auditors acceptable to ADB to audit financial statements, which will \nbe published regularly and reported to the shareholders. \n\u2022  Measurable financial performance indicators for each company to be \nestablished, evaluated, and benchmarked. \n\u2022  Introduction of an appropriate internal audit system through the capacity \nbuilding program.  \n\u2022  Implementation of an operational risk mitigation action plan and undertaking a \njoint operational risk assessment with development partners. \nInstitutional  \u2022  Public disclosure of operational and financial performance of the sector \nand/or  companies to improve transparency. \nCorporate  \u2022  Fully functional sector regulator to ensure equal opportunities for all sector \nGovernance  entities and to improve sector governance.  \n\u2022  Continued introduction of a new corporate culture through further \ncommercialization. \n\u2022  Appointment of independent board of directors. \n\u2022  Revision of board recruitment procedures. \n\u2022  Development of formal code of conduct for board of directors. \n\u2022  Delegation of powers to companies\u2019 management. \n\u2022  Promotion of private sector participation and public-private partnership. \n\u2022  Expansion of computerized billing system. \nSource: ADB assessment. \n ", "11 \n \nIII.  INVESTMENT PROPOSAL \n36.  The  Investment  Program  will  address  directly  sector  issues  and  provide  a  solid \nfoundation for the sustainable growth of the reformed power sector in MP. Consequently, quality \nand reliability of supply to consumers will improve, productive uses of electricity will escalate \neconomically,  and  quality  of  life  will  improve.  Additionally,  the  direct  benefit  to  electricity \nconsumers will underpin the expected economic value of the reforms. A secure and predictable \nelectricity  supply  will  enable  social  and  economic  benefits  to  materialize,  and  will  ensure \nimproved  conditions  for  schools,  hospitals,  and  other  social  services.  The  targeted  loss-\nreduction investments will bring the cost of supply in line with average retail tariffs by the end of \nthe Eleventh Plan (2008\u20132012), and will achieve sector profitability and eventually financial \nsustainability. The proposed Investment Program to be supported by ADB will require 8 years \nfor full implementation, and will require flexibility in subproject selection to achieve overall \nobjectives and to mitigate risk. \n \n37.  The  EAs  have  gained  substantial  experience  from  implementing  the  previous  ADB \nproject.  The  project  component  of  the  earlier  ADB  loan  covered  the  transmission  and \ndistribution subsectors. The program component assisted GOMP in (i) implementing key policy \nreforms and establishing a policy framework, including a fully operational, independent state \nregulatory commission; (ii) unbundling the MPSEB into five companies; (iii) improving sector \ngovernance through more functional independence; and (iv) restructuring tariffs and issuing new \ntariff  orders  that  allow  revenue  realization.  Remaining  policy  issues  are  currently  being \naddressed. The Investment Program will be a logical replication of the project component of the \nprevious ADB loan, covering transmission and distribution subsectors12 by taking into account \nthe  interrelated  nature  of  the  subsectors.  The  transmission  component  will  complete  the \nestablishment of a backbone for transmission, while the distribution component will extend \npower to end connections and target physical and nonphysical system losses. Subprojects are \ndesigned in a repeater nature in the transmission and distribution subsectors, and one set of \nproject from each subsector is presented in the Report and Recommendation of the President \n(RRP). The MFF is particularly well suited for the Investment Program because (i) the aim of the \nInvestment Program is to support GOMP\u2019s long-term objectives, as stated in the sector road \nmap; (ii) the performance of the previous loan can guide the provision of subsequent loans, \nthereby offering proper incentives for implementation; and (iii) the MFF can offer the flexibility \nrequired for the Investment Program to support the participation of four companies with different \nlevels of readiness.   \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n38.  The transmission and distribution component of MP\u2019s investment program from 2007 \nthrough 2012 is predicated on building sufficient capacity for evacuation of power from existing \nand planned power stations and substations, and delivering power reliability and efficiently to \nconsumers. ADB will finance key components of the transmission investment program from \n2007 through to 2012 ($250 million of an estimated total investment requirement of $1.4 billion), \nas  well  as  part  of  the  distribution  investment  program  ($360 million  of  a  total  estimated \ninvestment requirement of $1.6 billion). The construction of new transmission lines will remove \nconstraints to power flow, and will provide additional operational flexibility to TRANSCO in its \nrole as an independent system operator in MP. Supply reliability will be improved further, and \nwill  promote  open  access  and  development  of  intrastate  and  interstate  power  trading  by \n                                                 \n12 The generation expansion will be shared equally by the state, central, and private sectors. See para. 9. for details. \n \n ", "12   \nproviding sufficient excess substation and line capacity to handle unplanned power transfers. \nFrom the perspective of consumers, the impact of the distribution component will be more \npronounced  and  apparent.  Improvements  in  voltage  profiles  will  be  evident  through  better \nlighting and fewer equipment failures. Supply will be more consistent and momentary outages \nwill be reduced significantly. The distribution component also will impact directly technical and \nnontechnical losses, and eventually sector profitability and financial sustainability. \nB.  Outputs \n39.  The ADB supported subset of the investment program will cover three areas: \n(i)  Transmission  capacity  expansion.  Time-critical  transmission  lines, \nsubstations, and auxiliary equipment will be constructed to evacuate and transmit \npower from new power stations and substations to consumers. The scope of \ntransmission work will comprise the construction of (a) 2 cct-km of 400 kV13 and \n1,435  cct-km  of  220  kV  transmission  lines  across  the  state;  (b)  eight  new \n220/132 kV substations with transformer capacity of 160 MVA14 each; and (c) \none new 400/220/132 kV substation with 315 MVA transformer capacity. \n \n(ii)  Distribution efficiency enhancement. Targeted capital works will be designed \nto improve efficiency through loss reduction and to enhance supply reliability in \nall  DISCOMs.  Subprojects  will  include  (a)  rollout  of  an  HVDS;  (b)  remote \nmetering  of  high-value  customers  (metering  of  unmetered  consumers  and \ndistribution transformers metering); (c) renovation of substation protection, and \nmodernization  of  substations  and  substation  Supervisory  Control  and  Data \nAcquisition (SCADA); and (d) expansion of the village lighting scheme (feeder \nseparation scheme).  \n \n(iii)  Nonphysical  investments.  A  number  of  nonphysical  investments  will \ncomplement physical investments, including implementation of SCADA systems \nin DISCOM-E, development of a trading and settlements support system for \nTRADECO, facilitation of strategic PPP, and establishment of ECF and other \nenergy efficiency initiatives such as CDM. \n \nC.  Technical Justification and Selection Criteria  \n40.  Transmission components form part of the least-cost expansion plan of the Government, \nMP, and TRANSCO. TRANSCO\u2019s planning process uses investment signals provided through \nthe national and regional demand forecast produced by the CEA, and from state energy and \ndemand  forecasts  produced  with  the  assistance  of  DISCOMs.  TRANSCO\u2019s  transmission \nnetwork was modeled using power system analysis framework software, and this model was the \nprimary transmission planning tool for assessing the technical benefits of the transmission \ncomponents.  Distribution  components  were  modeled  and  analyzed  using  power  systems \nanalysis software, and are focused on network augmentation and reinforcement rather than \nexpansion. The expansion program is technically, financially, and economically viable. It can be \nimplemented with minimal environmental and social impact. Best practice design standards and \nconstruction techniques will be applied to all investments.  \n \n41.  The following are the criteria for selecting each subproject: \n                                                 \n13 Kilovolt (kV) \n14 Megavolt-ampere 1,000,000 volt-amperes (MVA). \n ", "13 \n \n(i)  Subproject designs will be consistent with overall least-cost expansion plans \ndesigned on a least cost basis and reflect \u201cbest practice\u201d design, construction, \nand operations and maintenance features. \n \n(ii)  Subprojects will display performance-based design consistent with international \nbenchmarks for system efficiency and operational risk.  Subprojects should have \nquantifiable energy efficiency improvements. \n \n(i)  Subproject designs will be consistent with the environmental management plan \n(EMP),  the  resettlement  framework  (RF),  and  the  indigenous  people \ndevelopment framework (IPDF). Land acquisition and resettlement plans (RP) \nand indigenous people development plans (IPDP) based on the agreed IPDF and \nthe RF will be prepared as necessary for additional subprojects before ADB \napproves funding. \n \n(ii)  All subprojects require environmental assessments in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment  Policy  (2002).  Category  A  subprojects  will  require  a  summary \nenvironmental impact assessment (SEIA), category B subprojects will require a \nsummary initial environmental examination (SIEE). SEIA and SIEE for category A \nand B-sensitive subprojects respectively must be prepared and made available to \nthe public 120 days before a Periodic Financing Request (PFR) is submitted to \nADB. EMPs with budgets will be prepared for each subproject. \n \nD.  Special Features \n42.  High-Voltage Distribution System. The objective of HVDS is a virtual elimination of \ntheft-related commercial losses, as well as significant reduction in technical losses. This will be \nachieved by replacing the overhead open wire low-voltage (0.4 kV) distribution system with a \nhigh-voltage (11 kV) distribution system, and placing additional, lower-rated transformers close \nto  consumers\u2019  premises.  By  extending  the  11  kV  network  closer  to  consumers\u2019  service \nconnections,  illegal  connections  from  lengthy  low-voltage  lines  will  become  difficult.  In  the \nabsence  of  LV  voltage  drop,  voltage  profiles  also  will  improve  and  interference  between \nneighboring customers\u2019 loads will be decreased. Further, unscheduled supply interruptions are \nexpected  to  be  reduced  from  fewer  overloaded  transformers  and  circuits.  A  pilot  study \nundertaken by DISCOM-W confirmed the viability of the HVDS scheme, with distribution loss in \nthe study area reduced from 26.7% to 8.4%.  \n \n43.  Strategic  Public-Private  Partnership  Scheme.  Under  the  Investment  Program,  a \nstrategic partnership with the private sector will be developed in selected urban areas under the \nfranchising modality with the intention of achieving the requisite reduction in distribution losses \nand improving the quality of service to consumers. If successful, this scheme will be extended \ninto other semi-urban and urban areas in MP. Under the modality, the strategic partnerships \nwith the private sector, selected through competitive bidding process, would buy power from the \nincumbent\u2019s distribution licensee at bulk import points. The PPP would be responsible for all \ndownstream distribution-related activities, including long-term capital investment and operation \nand maintenance. These franchises will be at least long enough to recover the investments in \nnetwork augmentation and expansion. Gwalior city under DISCOM-C has been selected for pilot \ntesting the scheme. \n \n44.  Energy Conservation Fund. ADB funds will partly capitalize a new special purpose \nvehicle created for the ECF. Operations of the ECF will be outsourced through competitive \n ", "14   \nbidding to a consortium of an ESCO with experience in project implementation and a financial \ninstitution with professional experience in fund management. Additional equity contributions by \npower sector companies and private financiers will be possible. ADB\u2019s direct participation will \ncreate  the  opportunity  for  additional  credit  enhancements  in  the  form  of  partial  credit \nguarantees,  cofinancing  from  the  new  CDM  and  energy  efficiency  funds  expected  to  be \noperational by 2007 and 2008. The ECF investments will be repaid from revenue generated \ndirectly by the projects. ADB participation in the ECF offers innovative financing, mobilizes \nprivate participation, and capitalizes on carbon credit opportunities. Various parties will need to \nbe consulted during the development of the ECF. For this reason, it will be included in one of \nthe further tranches of the MFF, tentatively scheduled for April 2008.  \n \n45.  Carbon Emissions Trading.  Cofinancing  of  alternative  energy  projects  is  possible \nthrough  the  Kyoto  Protocol  CDM,  second-tier  carbon  markets,  commercial  clean  energy \ninvestment funds, and the Global Environment Facility. CDM and second-tier carbon markets \nmight be the best options for carbon credit transactions. ADB will provide indirect support \nthrough an ongoing technical assistance project executed by the Ministry of Environment and \nForests, the designated national authority for CDM. The HVDS is the only component confirmed \nfor ADB funding that appears to be a promising CDM candidate based on expected emissions \nreductions. ADB will assist in preparing a project concept note for submission to the ministry to \nestimate the relative prospects for CDM. ADB will assist in further development accordingly \nthrough a technical assistance.15\n \nE.  Investment Program and Financing Plan \n46.  The total power sector investment program and indicative financing for 2007\u20132012 is \nshown in Table 2. Indicative cost estimates for appraised subprojects are in Appendix 5. \n \nTable 2: Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Investment Program, 2007\u20132012 \nInvestment Program 2007\u20132012     $ (million)  % \nInvestments       \n  Generation         2,300   43.1 \n  Transmission         1,400   26.2 \n  Distribution         1,600   30.0 \n  Nonphysical Investments              40   0.7 \nTotal Investments         5,340   100.0 \n       \nFinancing       \n  Domestic Financial Institutions         2,585   48.4 \n  Asian Development Bank    620  11.6 \n  Department for International Development , United    35  0.7 \nKingdom \n  Private Investors    700  13.1 \n  Internal Funds            800   15.0 \n  Government of Madhya Pradesh            600   11.2 \nTotal Funding          5,340   100.0 \n      Sources: Asian Development Bank estimates.  \n \n47.  The Government has requested financing up to the equivalent of $620 million (included \nin the Country Operations Business Plan 2007-2009) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to \nhelp  finance  part  of  the  Investment  Program  covering  transmission,  distribution,  capacity \nbuilding, and energy efficiency. ADB\u2019s participation as a partner (i) reduces the cost of funds, (ii) \n                                                 \n15 ADB. 2006.

Manila (TA 6346-REG). \n ", "15 \nestablishes  standards  in  various  thematic  areas,  and  (iii)  helps  to  attract  other  long-term \nfinanciers to the sector. The Government and GOMP have asked ADB to extend this finance in \nthe form of an MFF. \n \n48.  The financing will be provided under an MFF in accordance with ADB policy.16 The Staff \nInstructions on the Use of MFF17 was followed in processing the MFF. The MFF will extend \nmultiple loans to finance a range of projects under the Investment Program, subject to the \nsubmission of a related periodic financing request (PFR) by the Government and execution of \nthe related loan and project agreements. Each PFR will be accompanied by a detailed cost \nestimate, as well as an implementation schedule. The Framework Financing Agreement (FFA) \nsatisfies  the  requirements  set  forth  in  Appendix  4  of  the  Pilot  Financing  Instruments  and \nModalities (footnote 35). The Government is required to comply with the FFA requirements. The \nloans under the MFF will finance equipment supply and erection, consulting services, and other \ncapacity building activities. The minimum amount of a PFR will be $40 million, except for the \ncapacity building component, which will have a minimum loan amount of $5 million.  \n \n49.  All provisions of the ordinary operations loan regulations applicable to London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR)-based loans18 will apply to each loan, subject to any modifications that \nmight  be  included  under  any  loan  agreement.  The  Government  can  choose  from  eligible \ncurrencies and interest rate regimes for each loan. The specific terms of each loan will be based \non the related PFR, with interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based \nlending facility. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for its decisions to \nborrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices \nwere its own independent decision and not made in reliance on any communication or advice \nfrom  ADB.  The  Government  will  make  loans  available  to  GOMP  on  the  same  terms  and \nconditions as the ones applicable to the Government. GOMP will onlend to sector companies, \nas the EAs, with a 1 percentage point spread, through the respective onlending agreements. \n \n50.  If the Government requests any cofinancing arrangements or related assistance for \nprojects under the MFF from ADB, ADB may assist with these, subject to related ADB policy \nand procedures.  \n \n51.  The Government will provide the proceeds of the loans under the MFF in local currency \nto the state and through the state to the EAs. GOMP will bear the foreign exchange risk on the \nloans. \n \n52.  The MFF transaction is accompanied by Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 PFRs to finance a set \nof subprojects consisting transmission and distribution components, respectively, which are \nready for implementation.  \n \n(i)  PFR  1,  Transmission  Capacity  Expansion.  This  component  includes \nconstruction of (a) 2 circuit kilometers (cct-km) of 400 kV and 1,435 cct-km of \n220 kV transmission lines across MP; (b) eight new 220/132 kV substations, \nwith transformer capacity of 160 MVA each; and (c) one new 400/220/132 kV \nsubstation with 315 MVA transformer capacity.  \n \n                                                 \n16 ADB. 2005.

The distribution component will \nundertake (a) construction of HVDS in six  distribution circles in the eastern \ndistribution zone of MP, including conversion of about 7,400 km of low-voltage \nlines  to  high-voltage  lines;  (b)  remote  metering  of  about  2,000  industrial \nconsumers; (c) metering of about 250,000 consumers; and (d) renovation of \nprotection system at about 100 substations. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n53.  Executing Agencies.  TRANSCO  will  be  the  EA  for  the  transmission  component; \nDISCOM-E, DISCOM-C, and DISCOM-W will be the EAs for the distribution components in their \nrespective areas. A coordinating committee comprising the chairman and managing director of \nthe EAs, and led by the chairman and managing director of TRANSCO, will be established to \nmonitor and coordinate the overall implementation of the Investment Program. The coordinating \ncommittee  will  report  to  the  Energy  Department  of  GOMP.  At  the  state  level,  the  Energy \nDepartment  will  monitor  the  implementation  of  reform  policy  and  overall  power  sector \ninvestment. The MPERC will monitor the performance and improvement of service delivery of \nthe EAs at the state level. At the central level, the Ministry of Power will monitor state sector \npolicy  and  investment  program  implementation.  All  EAs  have  established  their  project \nmanagement  units  (PMU),  headed  by  a  full-time  project  manager.  Each  PMU  will  have \ntechnical, financial, procurement, and safeguards divisions. Since the PMU staff of TRANSCO \nand  DISCOMs  has  substantial  experience  from  implementing  the  previous  ADB-financed \nproject,  they  are  fully  conversant  with  ADB\u2019s  guidelines  and  procedures.  TRADECO  will \nimplement the capacity building component included in the third tranche, while the EA for \nenergy efficiency will be determined once the design is finalized. \n \n54.  Investment  Program  Management.  The EAs will be responsible for the appraisal, \nprocessing, and implementation of the Investment Program. The responsibilities will include the \npreparation of technical reports (feasibility studies, preliminary design reports, environmental \nassessment reports, resettlement and indigenous people\u2019s development plans, detailed design \nreports), and bidding documents to ensure compliance with requirements of the Government \nand ADB. Overall investment progress will be considered when new financing requests are \nsubmitted. The Investment Program Implementation Structure is in Appendix 6. \n \n55.  As the staff of TRANSCO and the three DISCOMs are technically competent and fully \nfamiliar with ADB\u2019s policies and guidelines, they will not require assistance from consultants for \nproject design and implementation. However, TRADECO will require consulting services for (i) \ndesign, procurement, and implementation of a power trading system; (ii) capacity building and \ntraining in power trading; and (iii) implementation of information technology and MIS design. In \naddition,  ADB  assistance  will  be  extended  for  design  and  implementation  of  the  energy \nefficiency  component,  as  well  as  monitoring  the  overall  implementation  of  the  Investment \nProgram, if necessary. \n  \n56.  Performance  Monitoring  and  Evaluation.  Performance  will  be  monitored  and \nevaluated based on indicators and targets stipulated in the design and monitoring framework. \nThe ADB team will prepare periodic reports to inform the ADB Board of Directors (the Board) of \noverall  progress.  A  Board  information  report  will  be  submitted  annually,  and  supplemental \nprogress reports will be submitted before Management approves individual loan agreements. \n \n57.  Review. ADB will field an Inception Mission within 3 months of the approval of each \ntranche.  ADB  will  review  the  implementation  and  operations,  including  resettlement,  and \nenvironmental aspects based on quarterly progress reports. Further, ADB will meet with GOMP \n ", "17 \nand the EAs semiannually to discuss implementation progress. A midterm review to be carried \nout 2 years after each tranche becomes effective will focus on the engineering, resettlement, \nenvironmental,  and  social  aspects  of  the  ADB-supported  investments,  and  will  review  the \nfinancial status of EAs. Representatives of ADB and the EAs will take part in the review. The \nreview will allow for any necessary midcourse corrections to ensure successful implementation \nand achievement of objectives. A completion report will be submitted within 3 months of the \ncompletion of each tranche. An MFF completion report will be prepared after the completion of \nall ADB-supported activities and projects under the Investment Program. \n \n58.  Implementation Period. The Investment Program will be implemented over 8 years, \nincluding procurement and construction activities, from 2007 to 2014. The loan agreements are \nexpected to have implementation periods of 4\u20135 years (Appendix 7). The last PFR should be \nsubmitted no later than the end of 2010.  \n \n59.  Procurement and Consulting Services. Procurement to be financed under the MFF \nwill be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to \ntime). International competitive bidding (ICB) will be used to procure equipment (conductors, \ntransformers, etc.) and turnkey construction of the facilities being funded under the Investment \nProgram (transmission lines, HDVS, etc.). ICB will be utilized for supply contracts estimated to \ncost  the  equivalent  of  or  more  than  $1  million.  Limited  international  bidding  or  national \ncompetitive bidding (NCB) will be used for supply contracts estimated at $250,000\u2013$1 million, \nand shopping for contracts estimated at less than $250,000. Under NCB the bidding documents \nand procurement procedures agreed between EAs and ADB, as also set out in the procurement \nplan will be followed. Any modification to these will be agreed between EAs and ADB and \nfurther  reflected  in  the  procurement  plan.  Contract  packages  will  be  prepared  to  ensure \nmaximum competition under ICB. In accordance with these arrangements, a procurement plan \nfor the subprojects under Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 are presented in Appendix 8. \n \n60.  Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the \nUse of Consultants (2006, as amended from time to time). Consulting firms will be selected \nthrough international competition using the quality- and cost-based selection method. Individual \nexperts may be recruited following ADB\u2019s procedures for engagement of individual consultants \nbased on resume submitted in response to the terms of reference for the assignment. Full \ntechnical proposals will be required for contracts valued at more than $1 million. Simplified \ntechnical proposals will be used for contracts worth between $600,000 and $1 million, and the \nresume for technical proposals for those less than $600,000. \n \n61.  Disbursement Arrangements. Loan proceeds will be disbursed in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time). For each loan, the \nGovernment will establish, operate, and maintain a first generation imprest account (FGIA) in \nReserve Bank of India in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook. The FGIA \naccount will be a current account, which will facilitate withdrawal of funds to meet project \nexpenditures whenever needed. The initial advance to an imprest account will be 6 months of \nestimated expenditures or 10% of the loan amount, which ever is lower. A second generation \nimprest account (SGIA) will be established for each loan in the name of each EA to receive \nfunds from the FGIA to meet project expenditures incurred. The SGIA will be established in a \nnon-interest  bearing  current  account  at  a  commercial  bank  acceptable  to  ADB  and  the \nGovernment. Interest income earned from the SGIA, if any, will be utilized by the relevant EAs \nfor project purposes only. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures will be used to reimburse eligible \nexpenditures  and  to liquidate  advances  to  the  FGIA  and  SGIA.  This  will  be  applicable  to \nexpenditures of $100,000 or less. ADB will conduct a training seminar on its disbursement \nprocedures for DISCOMs.   \n ", "18   \n   \n62.  Advance Contracting. To expedite the implementation of Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 \nsubprojects, ADB approved the request of the Government for advance contracting. ADB has \nreviewed and approved bidding documents for transmission subprojects, which were issued in \nDecember 2006. The bidding documents for distribution subprojects are being prepared. Once \nADB reviews and approves the documents, they will be issued in February 2007. For each \nfuture tranche, the Government will request ADB\u2019s approval for advance contracting. \n \n63.  Retroactive  Financing.  ADB\u2019s  Management  may  consider  and  allow  retroactive \nfinancing of eligible expenditures when included in PFRs. Except as otherwise agreed with \nADB,  the  expenditures  incurred  for  equipment  and  consulting  services  will  be  eligible  for \nadvanced contracting, provided that these are incurred before the effectiveness of the related \nloan agreement, but not earlier than 12 months preceding the signing of the related loan \nagreement, and as long as they do not exceed an amount of 20% of the individual loan. The \nGovernment and EAs have been informed that approval of advanced contracting and retroactive \nfinancing does not commit ADB to finance any of the proposed subprojects. Each PFR will \nspecify the nature of expenditure if retroactive financing is requested. Retroactive financing will \napply from the third tranche onward. \n \n64.  Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s policy on Anticorruption (1998, as amended up to date) \nwas explained to and discussed with GOMP and the EAs. Consistent with its commitment to \ngood  governance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to  investigate, \ndirectly or through its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices \nrelating to subprojects under the MFF. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s \npolicy on Anticorruption are included in the loan regulations and the bidding documents for the \nMFF. In particular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with subprojects under the \nInvestment Program will include provisions specifying ADB\u2019s right to audit and examine the \nrecords and accounts of the EAs and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service \nproviders as they relate to the subprojects and components under the Investment Program (see \npara. 38 for governance measures in these areas).   \n \n65.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. Quarterly progress reports will be prepared for \nthe individual components for review by ADB. The reports will include a description of physical \nprogress  and  problems,  and  a  summary  of  financial  accounts  that  will  consist  of  loan \nexpenditures during the period, year to date, and total to date. Progress on environmental and \nsocial compliance, overall progress, and compliance with conditions of the FFA and individual \nloan and project agreements also will be included in the progress reports. Further, the progress \nreports will include an evaluation of issues or problems faced by the EAs and recommended \nremedial  actions.  A  project  completion  report  will  be  submitted  within  3  months  of  the \ncompletion  of  each  component.  The  EAs  will  maintain  separate  accounts  for  each  loan \n(tranches). Within 6 months of the close of the financial year, the EAs will submit audited project \naccounts and financial statements. An independent auditor acceptable to ADB will be hired by \nthe EAs to conduct the audit. \n \nIV.  BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \nA.  Financial Analysis \n66.  Institutional  and  financial  analyses  of  the  Tranche  1  and  Tranche  2  subprojects \n(Appendix 9 and further details are in Supplementary Appendix E ) have been carried out in \naccordance  with  Guidelines  for  the  Financial  Governance  and  Management  of  Investment \n ", "19 \nProjects Financed by the ADB19. The analysis was conducted for 2008\u20132032 for TRANSCO, the \nEA for Tranche 1, and DISCOM-E, the EA for Tranche 2. The financial evaluation of subprojects \nwas  undertaken  in  real  terms  using  constant  2006  prices.  Incremental  costs  and  benefits \nattributable to investments were derived by comparing \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project scenarios. \nThe financial internal rate of return (FIRR) is estimated to be 4.8% for Tranche 1 transmission \nsubprojects and 8.3% for Tranche 2 distribution subprojects. This compares favorably with their \nweighted average cost of capital (WACC) for this period, which is 3.4% for TRANSCO and 2.3% \nfor DISCOM-E. When discounted at WACC, investments have net present values of Rs1.2 \nbillion for the transmission subprojects and Rs2.8 billion for the distribution subprojects. Tranche \n1 and Tranche 2 investments, therefore, are considered financially viable and sustainable. \nSensitivity and risk analysis indicates that the FIRR for Tranche 1 and Tranche 2, as well as the \noverall Investment Program, are robust with (i) 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) 10% increase \nin operational and maintenance costs, (iii) 10% reduction in benefits, (iv) 2-year delay in project \ncompletion plus 20% increase in costs, and (v) no residual value.  \n \nB.  Financial Management  \n67.  A  financial  management  assessment  (FMA)  was  carried  out  using  ADB\u2019s  FMA \nquestionnaire to review the capacity of the sector companies to manage financial aspects of the \nMFF. The FMA is an independent assessment based on discussions with officials of sector \ncompanies and review of reports prepared for the sector companies under the earlier DFID-\nsponsored  technical  assistance.  The  unbundled  power  sector  companies  inherited  billing, \naccounting, and management information systems from MPSEB that were developed to meet \nthe Electricity Supply Association Accounting Rules established in 1985. These systems are not \nsuitable  to  meet  the  management  and  reporting  requirements  of  commercial  companies \noperating under the Companies Act 1956. The current systems have limitations and are not fully \ncomputerized. While these systems can meet the companies\u2019 statutory reporting requirements, \nthey cannot provide useful and timely online information for management of the new companies \nand meet the information requirements of MPERC. As part of the capacity building support, \nfunding has been allocated to meet the \u00a318.5 million cost of new systems, covering billing, \naccounting,  and  MIS  for  the  three  DISCOMs  and  TRANSCO  to  purchase  software  and \nhardware, 20   implementation,  training,  and  5-year  service  support.  Under  the  capacity \ndevelopment program, companies have been updating the chart of accounts and accounting \npolicies to comply with the Companies Act 1956, as well as preparing their long-term business \nplans.  In  addition,  the  new  companies  are  receiving  comprehensive  training  on  revised \naccounting procedures, preparing cost accounting manuals, assisting with the preparation of \ntariff petitions to MPERC, and developing internal audit procedures.  \n \nC.  Past and Projected Financial Performance \n68.  Over 2001\u20132005, the MPSEB reduced annual financial losses from a high of Rs13.7 \nbillion in 2002 to Rs2.7 billion in 2005. The improvement of the financial situation is mainly \nattributable to an increase in electricity sales and in average revenues from Rs2.53 per kWh to \nRs3.05 per kWh. In addition, as a result of sector financial restructuring, interest charges \ndeclined from Rs11.373 billion to Rs3.121 billion in 2005.  \n \n                                                 \n19 ADB. 2002. Guidelines for the Financial Governance and Management of Investment Projects Financed by the \nADB. Manila. \n20 Approximately 50% of the cost will be met by the DFID grant with the companies providing the balance of the \nfunding for the proposed software and hardware. \n \n ", "20   \n69.  MPERC has introduced MYT determinations for generation and transmission companies. \nFollowing single-year price determinations in 2006 and 2007 for distribution companies, MPERC \nwill provide a 3-year tariff determination covering 2008 to 2010. This will provide certainty for \ncompanies and customers. At the same time, per the Electricity Act, 2003 and National Tariff \nPolicy, all tariffs are to be plus or minus 20% of the cost of supply by the end of 2011. Thus, \nprogressive increases in tariffs, coupled with a reduction in losses from the current level of 41% \nfor transmission and distribution to 24% by 2012, will continue to improve the companies\u2019 \nfinancial performance over the next 5 years.  \n \n70.  For Tranche 1, TRANSCO\u2019s projected financial performance indicators improve over the \nforecast period with a debt service coverage ratio exceeding 1.2 in all years from 2008. The \nself-financing capacity of the company improves towards the end of the forecast period, with \nTRANSCO able to meet at least 20% of capital expenditures from internal sources from 2013 \nonward. The debt to debt-plus-equity ratio of 67% in 2007 falls steadily to 45% by 2016. ADB \nwill fund about 63% of the capital expenditures, with the balance financed by internal funds, \nGOMP  equity,  and  PFC  loans.  TRANSCO\u2019s  financial  position  is  improving  as  a  result  of \nincreasing tariffs and revenues. The improving self-financing ratio and adequate debt service \nratio assure the financial sustainability of the company with the ADB investment (Appendix 11, \nSupplementary Appendix G).  \n \n71.  For Tranche 2, DISCOM-E tariff increases approved by MPERC allow profitability to be \nachieved by 2008. DISCOM-E return on equity will be positive from 2008. Return on historic \naverage net fixed assets will increase to 19.3% in 2009 and remain above 16% thereafter. Debt \nto debt-plus-equity ratio is forecast to fall from 68.3% in 2006 to 39.6% by 2012. ADB will fund \nabout 57% of the proposed project with the balance funded by equity from GOMP, retained \nearnings, and PFC loans. Grants from the Government will fund 90% of rural electrification with \n10% financed by loans through the rural electrification corporation. Full electrification of MP \nstate is projected to be achieved at the end of 2009. At the proposed tariffs, DISCOM-E exhibits \na strong cash flow with a debt service ratio of at least 1.3 in all years. The self-financing \ncapacity of DISCOM-E exceeds 20% from 2009. The projections for DISCOM-E show sustained \nfinancial improvement from 2007 through to 2016, and indicate that the company is capable of \nabsorbing the proposed investments under the MFF (Appendix 11, Supplementary Appendix G).. \n \nD.  Economic Analysis \n72.  Economic  analysis  (Appendix  12)  was  undertaken  for  transmission  and  distribution \ncomponents to be funded under the Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 in accordance with the Guidelines \nfor Economic Analysis of Projects21. Economic internal rates of return (EIRR) were calculated by \ncomparing \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project scenarios. The main economic benefits are displaced \nthermal  electricity  generation  and  incremental  consumption.  These  benefits  arise  from  a \nreduction in technical and nontechnical losses, removal of network constraints, and improved \nreliability of supply. Benefits were quantified through load flow analyses and from pilot studies \nundertaken in other states. Demand forecasts, prepared by TRANSCO for Tranche 1, were \nbased on projections of historical sales data, modified by population growth, the impact of real \ntariff increases, and the impact of real increases in household income. Non-incremental output \nfrom the subprojects was valued based on the displaced generation from coal-fired thermal \nplants. Incremental output was valued using consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for incremental \nconsumption. Initial estimates indicate that Tranche 1 transmission subprojects have an overall \nEIRR of 15.0% and Tranche 2 distribution subprojects an overall EIRR of 14.7%. These EIRRs \nindicate that Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 components are economically viable. Sensitivity analysis \n                                                 \n21 ADB. 1997. Guidelines for the Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n ", "21 \nrevealed that expected economic outcomes from transmission subprojects are robust under a \nrange of downside scenarios, reflecting the urgent need for augmentation of the transmission \nnetwork. Distribution subprojects are also robust, although sensitivity to forecast demand growth \nis apparent for some subprojects. \n \nE.  Environmental Analysis \n73.  A draft environmental assessment and review framework (EARF) has been prepared for \nthe Investment Program, outlining the policy, procedures, and institutional requirements for the \noverall  Investment  Program  and  each  tranche  (Supplemental  Appendix  K).  The  EAs  are \nresponsible  for  preparing  the  required  environmental  assessments  and  obtaining  ADB \nconcurrence before implementation. Environmental assessment of the proposed investments \nhas  been  and  will  continue  to  be  conducted  following  ADB\u2019s  Environment  Policy  (2002); \nEnvironmental  Assessment  Guidelines  (2003)22;  ADB  Staff  Instructions  on  the  Use  of  the \nMultitranche  Financing  Facility  (2006)23  ;the  EARF;  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental \nassessment regulations and guidelines. The first and second tranche investments are classified \nas category B24 in accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines. The EAs \n(TRANSCO and DISCOM-E) have prepared IEEs for Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 components. \nEnvironmental assessment also will be prepared in due course for the remaining components in \neach tranche, as outlined in the EARF. A summary IEE (Appendix 13) for Tranche 1 and \nTranche 2 outlines environmental benefits and negative impacts, proposed mitigation measures, \nand preliminary EMP (Supplementary Appendix L). Public consultations indicate strong local \nsupport for the proposed investments. \n \n74.  Based on the environmental assessments and reconnaissance surveys, most of the \nimpacts will occur during construction. The principal impacts are related to acquisition of rights-\nof-way for transmission lines, earthmoving and initial clearing of vegetation for construction, and \nperiodic clearing of vegetation during operations. These impacts will be mitigated by selective \nrouting of transmission lines, appropriate erosion-control measures, proper management of \nconstruction-related wastes, and provision of compensation for reforestation, as necessary. No \nendangered, rare, or threatened species of flora or fauna have been reported at any project \nsites. Adequate provisions have been made for the environmental mitigation and monitoring \nrequirements and their associated costs. The project sites are mostly on government-owned \nland. The land acquired for new substations is mostly uninhabited, unused, and outside towns \nand villages. Mitigation measures related to construction and specified in the EMP will be \nincorporated into civil works contracts. Although the contractors will have primary responsibility \nfor implementation of mitigation measures during construction, the implementing agencies will \nbe responsible for overall implementation of site-specific EMPs. \n \n75.  The proposed Investment Program has potential cumulative and induced impacts, which \nare considered largely positive. Distribution and transmission system efficiency improvements \nwill result in energy savings of at least 1,200 gigawatt-hour (GWh) per year, with equivalent \ncarbon dioxide (CO ) reductions of more than 1 million tons per year. Environmental and social \n2\nbenefits of the investment components and long-term program objectives outweigh the negative \nimpacts. The EARF will guide environmental management activities robustly for the life of the \nMFF.   \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n23 ADB. 2006. Staff Instructions on the Use of the Multitranche Financing Facility. Manila. \n24 Each tranche will be subject to environmental categorization. All tranches are expected to be Category B or C. \nTranches will be re-categorized as necessary if Category A- or B-sensitive projects and/or subprojects are \nidentified. \n ", "22   \n \nF.  Social Assessment \n76.  In full consultation with stakeholders and affected persons, an RF, RP, and IPDF were \nprepared, which will be the basis for preparing subsequent RPs and IPDPs for additional \nsubprojects in accordance with ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement (1995), Policy on \nIndigenous Peoples (1998), and relevant sections of the Operations Manual. Tranche 1 and \nTranche 2 will have no impacts on indigenous people. The RP, RF, and IPDF were disclosed to \nthe affected persons in their local language in December 2006 (Appendix 14, Appendix 15 and \nSupplementary Appendix J). Future RPs and IPDPs will be prepared and disclosed to affected \npersons, and all compensation will be paid before the start of civil works. GOMP has agreed to \nmonitor the implementation of both frameworks, and to endorse the frameworks for future \ntranches. Frameworks that are part of the FFA will be considered a prerequisite to apply for \nfinancing by the EAs. Appraisal of successive tranches will require a review of the RF and IPDF, \nas well as the preparation of the RPs and IPDPs, if needed, or the appropriate indigenous \npeople (IP) actions for all subprojects with IP issues. \n \n77.  Minimal  land  acquisition  is  required  for  the  transmission  network  expansion  under \nTranche 1. One of the 18 substations will require the acquisition of 3 hectares (ha) of private \nland, affecting three households. If land acquisition from private owners is required, the EA has \nallocated sufficient budgetary resources to cover the compensation packages provided in the \nRP. A maximum of 612 ha of land is estimated to be acquired temporarily for transmission lines, \naffecting a maximum of 1,528 people (for less than 10% of their assets). Since the EA has \nensured that all the transmission lines will pass through agricultural land, substantial loss of land \nvalue is not expected on any of the affected plots. The EA also has ensured that scheduling the \nconstruction of towers and the stringing to minimize crop disruption is common practice. No \nprivate land is required permanently or temporarily for the expansion of the distribution system \nunder Tranche 2. \n \n78.  Impacts  of  Tranche  1,  and  future  tranches,  if  any,  are  expected  to  be  minimal. \nCompensation packages and a short RP have been prepared for the subproject components of \nTranche 1. The short RP also covers the transmission network expansion to be financed under \nTranche 3. However, the short RP, will be updated during the preparation of Tranche 3. \n \nG.  Poverty Assessment \n79.  The MFF is designed to benefit all grid-connected consumers with adequate and reliable \nsupply of electricity, which would support the Government\u2019s projections for growth in energy \ndemand and its intent to make affordable grid-based electricity supply available to the entire \npopulation by 2012. Government policy includes support to poor households via a lifeline tariff \nfor the first 1 kWh of consumption per household per day. A secure and predictable electricity \nsupply will enable social and economic benefits to materialize, as well as ensure improved \nconditions  for  schools,  hospitals,  and  other  social  services.  Improvements  in  quality  and \nreliability of supply that will accrue from targeted investments are expected to improve living \nconditions in the rural areas through the creation of job and income opportunities. Farmers and \nsmall  business  owners  are  expected  to  increase  their  productivity.  Demand  for  electric \ninstallations, supplies, and maintenance is expected to increase, creating additional new job \nopportunities. In addition, a reliable electricity supply improves quality of life of households, \nespecially for women who are traditionally responsible for the activities inside the house.  \n \n ", "23 \nH.  Potential Risks \n80.  Risks include (i) inability of DISCOMs to reduce losses as agreed with MPERC, resulting \nin lower revenues and failure to meet debt service on subproject investments; (ii) delays in \npower sector reforms, resulting in limited financial independence of companies and continued \ncentralization  of  cash  flow  mechanisms;  (iii)  delays  in  construction  of  power  projects  not \nfinanced by ADB, leading to further energy and peak capacity shortages, as well as lower \nelectricity  sales  and  revenues  than  forecast;  (iv)  increases  in  the  prices  of  construction \nmaterials, resulting in financially nonviable investments; (vi) failure to mobilize the necessary \ncounterpart funds; (vii) delays in procurement and contract awards; and (vii) increases in the \ncost of delivered electricity due to suboptimal power purchasing and other factors, leading to \nlower-than-expected demand for electricity. These risks are regarded as low, or have been \nminimized  to  the  extent  possible  in  project  formulation  and  implementation  as  follows:  (i) \ninvestment has been provided to achieve the targeted loss reduction; (ii) GOMP is committed to \nongoing sector reforms and full financial independence of the operating companies; (iii) the \nenergy balance demonstrates that adequate excess will be available for purchase within MP \nand from outside of MP to meet electricity sales forecasts; (iv) adequate physical and price \ncontingencies are provided to meet quantity and cost escalations, cost estimates have been \nbased on a basket of recent tender prices, and MPERC\u2019s tariff-setting principles allow costs of \napproved investments to be passed through in the tariff; (vi) GOMP has provided assurances on \nthe timely provision of counterpart funding; (vii) tender documents are prepared for Tranche 1 \ntransmission subprojects and are being prepared for Tranche 2 distribution subprojects, and \nadvance action for procurement has been requested; and (viii) appropriate risk management \nmechanisms will be incorporated in the evolving corporate governance framework.   \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \n81.  In addition to the standard assurances, the Government and GOMP have given the \nfollowing assurances, which have been largely incorporated in the FFA, and will be incorporated \nin the individual loan agreement(s) and project agreement(s) as applicable and mutually agreed \nbetween the Government and ADB for each project under the MFF. \n \nA.  Financial and Sector Reforms \n82.  Sector Reforms.

Power Sector Reforms \n1.  Guided  by  the  National  Electricity  Act,  2003,  the  Government  of  Madhya  Pradesh \n(GOMP) has been driving power sector reforms with the aim of strengthening its physical and/or \nnonphysical capacities and enhancing financial viability. Reforms comprise unbundling of the \nMadhya Pradesh State Electricity Board (MPSEB), tariff rationalization, and sector financial \nrestructuring, as well as significant changes in regulatory approaches, open access to the grid, \nand power trading.  \n \n2.  MPSEB was unbundled into five wholly state-owned government companies: Madhya \nPradesh Power Generating Company Ltd (GENCO), Madhya Pradesh Power Transmission \nCorporation  Company  Ltd  (TRANSCO),  and  three  distribution  companies  (DISCOM-E, \nDISCOM-C, and DISCOM-W). In June 2006, the single electricity buyer and/or seller role of \nMPSEB was transferred to a newly incorporated company (TRADECO). \n \n \n Figure A2.1: Reorganization of Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board \n \n<Before> <After Unbundling of the Power Sector>\nMPERC\nState Regulator\nPower Purchase \nGENCO\nPower \nfrom Other States \nPurchase  Generation Company\nand IPPs\nfrom Other \nStates and \nMPSEB\nIPPs\n Madhya \nPradesh State  TRADECO TRANSCO\nElectricity  Trading   Transmission  \nBoard  Company Company\nEnergy Flow\nDISCOM-W DISCOM-C DISCOM-E\nDistribution   Distribution   Distribution  \nCompany Company Company\nEnergy Flow\nConsumers Consumers\n \n \nSource: ADB assessment \n  \n \n3.  MPERC\u2019s  framework  is  in  place,  and  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Electricity  Regulatory \nCommission (MPERC) has implemented the tariff order system aggressively. In December \n2005, MPERC issued multiyear tariff (MYT) determinations for the generating and transmission \ncompanies. Distribution companies filed MYT petitions on 31 October 2006 and will be effective \non 1 April 2007.  \n ", "36  Appendix 2 \n4.

Financial Restructuring \n5.  In  2003,  GOMP\u2019s  MPSEB  developed  a  financial  restructuring  plan  (FRP)  with  the \nobjectives of (i) consolidating the financial performance and position of the sector, (ii) ensuring \naccurate and transparent transfer of assets and liabilities from GOMP to the sector entities, (iii) \ndeveloping a plan to achieve sector financial sustainability through the targeted allocation of \nfinancial obligations, and (iv) introducing increases in real tariffs and providing a platform for \nopen access.  \n \n6.  In November 2005, the FRP was revised to reflect latest changes, such as coal price \nincreases, new generation and power purchase planning, and the tariff order for 2006. The \nupdate  was  formulated  considering  MPSEB  as  an  integrated  utility,  offsetting  the  cross-\n ", "  Appendix 2  37 \ncompany transactions taking place after implementation of the transfer scheme. The revised \nFRP included (i) additional provisioning for doubtful debts, and write-off of Rs3.85 billion and a \nfurther Rs0.6 billion of bad debts in MPSEB\u2019s balance sheet, and expensed before devolution to \nthe companies; (ii) conversion of all overdue loans and bonds from GOMP into equity; (iii) \ntransfer  of  Rural  Electrification  Corporation  loan  to  GOMP  through  adjustments  against \nreceivables toward free electricity bill waiver (Rs14.140 billion); and (iv) adjustment of cross \ndues,  receivables  and  payables  and  power  purchase  receivable  and  payables  toward, \nMaharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh state electricity boards.  \n \n7.  As the result of the FRP, cleaning up of balance sheets largely has been completed \n(Table A2.1). The power sector is expected to achieve an accounting profit in 2011 with a \nhealthier debt-equity ratio (Table A2.2). The revised FRP planned to focus on several pending \nissues; (i) remaining pension liabilities, (ii) contingent liabilities, and (iii) provisioning for non-\nmoving items. The final phase of the FRP will be included as part of the next MYT review, \nthereby completing and consolidating the financial restructuring. \n \nTable A2.1 : Balance Sheet of Madhya Pradesh State Electricity Board  \n(Rs million) \n2001  2002  2003  2004  2005 \n \nAssets  119,935     106,548 116,043 143,077    154,853\nEquity   (1,965)    (14,647)  (15,634)  (13,170)      44,189\n \nLiabilities  48,202     57,025 61,401 75,690      51,455\nDebt/Debt Plus Equity (%)  102.7 129.6 128.6 119.5  57.3\nCurrent Assets/Current Liabilities  1.02 0.61 0.66 0.69  1.26\n(-) = Negative \nNote: 2001 accounts are for 15 April 2000 to 31 March 2001 (as per 2002 audited accounts). \nBalance Sheet of 2005 was not audited. \n \nTable A2.2: Sector Financial Projections  \n(Rs million) \nItem  2006  2007  2008  2009  2010  2011  2012 \nRevenues  643  772  1,017  1,221  1,378  1,532  1,671 \nExpenditure  719  850  1,064  1,262  1,414  1,468  1,594 \nProfit or Loss  (76)  (78)  (46)  (41)  (36)  64  77 \nProvision for Income Tax  -  -  -  -  - 5  7 \nProfit or Loss After Tax  (76)  (78)  (46)  (41)  (36)  58  70 \nReturn on Average Equity (%)  (10)  (4)  (2)  (1)  (1)  2  2 \n               \nBalance Sheet               \nAssets  1,673  1,933  2,196  2,439  2,567  2,560  2,510 \nPension Liability  484  468  447  419  383  340  288 \nLong-Term Liabilities  745  937  1,091  1,223  1,320  1,256  1,216 \nEquity  444  528  658  798  863  964  1,006 \nTotal Equity and Liabilities  1,673  1,933  2,196  2,439  2,567  2,560  2,510 \nDebt/Debt Plus Equity (%)  45  48  50  50  51  49  48 \n(-) = Negative \nSource: Financial Restructuring Plan November, 2005. \n ", "38  Appendix 2 \n \nC.  Capacity Development \n8.  Since the initial power sector reforms, ADB has taken a joint approach in capacity \ndevelopment with other Development Partners (DPs). In tandem with the power sector financial \nand organizational restructuring, ADB\u2019s earlier program loan and sector investment project \nhelped  GOMP  to  (i)  improve  the  policy  environment  and  governance,  (ii)  initiate  the \nestablishment of a commercial and competitive business environment to promote efficiency \ngains  and  loss  reduction;  and  (iii)  introduce  a  computerized  information  and  revenue \nmanagement system. Contemporaneously, DFID implemented its \u00a310 million capacity building \nprogram.  \n \nFigure A2.3: Overview of Capacity Development Program (ADB & DFID) \n<DFID \u00a318.5M ($35.2M) >   <ADB  $620M  >\n<Phisical Investment $610M>\nContinued Development of   (cid:31)Policy coordination and reform \nEnabling Environment  programme management (GOMP)    (cid:31)Phisical Capacity Expansion\n-including communications, socio-economic \nand environmental issues     \n<GBP 4m (+GBP 0.4m reviews and GBP 0.5m     -Transmission -TRANSCO\ncontingencies)>    -Distriburion-DISCOM-E\n(cid:31)Strengthened Regulation Function                      -DISCOM-W\n<Remaining Issues of  Support to MPERC, including management                       -DISCOM-C\nMPPSDP> systems, stakeholder participation, recruitment                       TRADECO  \nand training <GBP 2m>  \nFinal Unbundling of \nMPSEB (cid:31)Transfer of employees, etc.\n-HR support to the five companies, including \n<Non Physical Investment $10M>\nstaff transfer, needs assessment, recruitment, \ntraining, reward and service rules <GBP 1m>\nFurther Internal \nReforms (cid:31)Backbone MIS  (cid:31)Empowering Trading Function \n-MIS/IT support, to deliver an ERP solution for  -Support to TRADECO for development \nthe five companies <GBP1.5m + 4m> systems and capacity building\n \n (cid:31)Financial Position Strengthening \nEnhancement of \nFinancial Viability   -Support to DISCOMs, including financial   (cid:31)System Loss Reduction and \nmanagement and accounting,  Reliability Enahncement  \ncommercialisation, investment and business \n-Support to DISCOMs for implementing \nplanning, regulation, technical support, trading \nSCADA systems \nand market operations <GBP 3.6m>\n-Support to GENCO and TRANSCO, including \nfinancial management, commercialisation, \ninvestment and business planning, regulation, \ntrading and market operations <GBP1.5m>\n \nSource: Asian Development Bank Assessment  \n \n9.  ADB  and  DFID  have  been  exploring  a  similar  collaborative  arrangement  during \nimplementation of the Investment Program. DFID is providing up to \u00a318.5 million ($35.2 million \nas of 21 September 2006) in technical assistance (\u00a314.5 million) and financial assistance (\u00a34 \nmillion) from 2006 to 2010, which will include (i) support to GOMP for mapping further reforms; \nincluding  subsidy  review  and  communications;  (ii)  capacity  development  in  MPERC;  (iii) \ntechnical,  business  planning,  and  financial  management  support  to  all  sector  companies \ntogether with MIS and human resources development.  \n \n10.  To maximize the synergy with the DFID program, a selective capacity development \nprogram is envisaged by ADB, focusing on implementation support of SCADA systems in the \nDISCOMS and TRADECO, whose future role is pivotal for the effective commercial operation of \nthe reformed sector. \n ", "  Appendix 3  39 \nPOWER SECTOR ASSESSMENT \n \nA.  National Sector Structure \n1.  India has confirmed its intent to provide universal power supply at an affordable price by \n2012, which will require an estimated 100,000  megawatt (MW) of new generating capacity. The \nGovernment also intends to use more indigenous hydropower resources, thereby shifting the \nsupply mix in favor of hydropower at the expense of coal-fired thermal plants. Recognizing that \nthe poor performance of state electricity boards in the past was a roadblock to private sector \ninvestment, The Government adopted in 2001 a program of unbundling, open access tariff \nrestructuring,  and  rationalization.  Independent  regulatory  bodies  also  were  established  at \ncentral and state levels. The Electricity Act, 2003 mandated full metering for all consumer \nclasses, multiyear tariff determinations, tariffs to be within 20% of the deemed cost of supply, \navailability-based tariffs, and 100% rural electrification.  \n \n2.  The Government\u2019s Ministry of Power (MOP) provides overall guidance to the sector \nthrough the Central Electricity Authority (CEA). MOP owns central power utilities, such as the \nNational  Thermal  Power  Cooperation,  National  Hydroelectric  Power  Cooperation,  Nuclear \nPower Cooperation, and the Powergrid Corporation of India, which are engaged in generation \nand interstate power transmission. The Rural Electrification Corporation and the Power Finance \nCorporation are Government-owned institutions dedicated to financing power sector activities. A \npower trading corporation was established recently to take responsibility for power trading \namong states, as well as between states and central power utilities.  \n \n3.  In  technical  and  economic  matters,  MOP  is  assisted  by  CEA,  a  statutory  body \nconstituted under the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, which was replaced by the Electricity Act, \n2003.  CEA,  an  attached  office  of  MOP,  is  responsible  for  the  technical  coordination  and \nsupervision of programs, and also is entrusted with some statutory functions. Headed by a \nchairman, CEA comprises six full-time members.  CEA is responsible for preparing a national \nelectricity plan in accordance with the National Electricity Policy (NEP).  \n \n4.  The Indian Parliament passed the Electricity Regulatory Commissions (ERC) Act in \n1998, the same year the Central Energy Regulatory Commission (CERC) was established. The \nERC Act gives CERC full autonomy to regulate central power utilities and to set bulk tariffs. The \nERC Act also encourages the states to establish state electricity regulatory commissions with \nfull authority to regulate state-level power utilities. \n \nB.  Provisions of Electricity Act, 2003 \n5.  The Electricity Act, 2003 is the cornerstone legislation for the power sector, and provides \nthe legal framework for the efficient development of the sector. The act is concerned primarily \nwith unbundling of state electricity boards, open access, and competition. Salient provisions of \nthe Electricity Act, 2003 are (i) exemption from licensing requirements for electricity generation, \n(ii) open access in electricity transmission, (iii) licensing for electricity trading, (iv) arrangement \nof licenses for laying lines for private transmission, (v) promotion of competition by allowing \nmore than one distribution company in one area of supply, (vi) ensuring electricity supply to the \nconsumers at minimum standards, and (vii) provision for establishment of tribunals in place of \nthe High Court for appeals against the orders of CERC. \n \n6.  The act includes a provision for MOP to update regularly and publish a NEP. The current \npolicy document is dated 12 February 2005. Its broad policy objectives include (i) access to \n ", "40  Appendix 3 \nelectricity for all households by 2010; (ii) demand to be fully met by 2012, and energy and \npeaking shortages to be overcome with adequate spinning reserve available; (iii) efficient supply \nof  reliable  and  quality  power  of  specified  standards  at  reasonable  rates;  (iv)  per  capita \navailability of electricity to be increased to more than 1,000 kilowatt-hour (kWh) by 2012; (v) \nminimum lifeline consumption of 1 kWh per household per day by 2012; (vi) financial turnaround \nand commercial viability of the sector; and (vii) protection of consumers\u2019 interests. \n \nC.  Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Structure \n7.  A  vertically  integrated  monopoly,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Electricity  Board  (MPEB), \noperated the Madhya Pradesh (MP) power sector under state direction. MPEB interacted with \nthe  central  power  utilities  for  planning  and  coordination.  In  the  early  1990s,  MPEB  faced \nnegative equity, increases in transmission and distribution losses, power shortages, and poor \nquality of power supply. From 1992, it was unable to reach the minimum return of 3% on fixed \nassets, as required by the Electricity Supply Act, 1948. As a consequence, revenue subsidies \nfrom the state government increased from 19% in 1993 to 40% in 1999 of total revenues. The \ninability to invest in generation, transmission, and distribution due to lack of funds eroded the \nalready weak condition of the MP power sector.  \n \n8.  Madhya  Pradesh  State  Electricity  Board. In 2000, the state of Chhattisgarh was \ncarved out of Madhya Pradesh state, and the MPEB was divided in Madhya Pradesh State \nElectricity Board (MPSEB) and Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board. The assets and project-\nrelated  liabilities  were  allocated  geographically,  while  non-project  related-liabilities  were \ndistributed based on population. MPSEB assumed about 79% of the long-term debt, only 67% \nof  the  revenue  base,  and  94%  of  agricultural  consumers,  with  excess  power  generation \nallocated to the Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board. This imbalanced allocation had a negative \nimpact on MPSEB. \n \n9.  The Electricity Act, 2003, the central legislation, came into force on 9 June 2003. With \nthe State Act, it envisaged the reorganization of MPSEB and introduced significant changes in \nregulatory approaches, open access to the grid, and power trading. Under the power sector \nreform program, and in line with the Electricity Act, 2003, Government of Madhya Pradesh \n(GOMP)  has  unbundled  the  MPSEB  into  five  wholly  state-owned  government  companies: \nMadhya  Pradesh  Power  Generating  Company  Ltd  (GENCO),  Madhya  Pradesh  Power \nTransmission  Corporation  Company  Ltd  (TRANSCO),  and  three  distribution  companies \n(DISCOM-E for the Eastern area, DISCOM-C for the Central area, and DISCOM-W for the \nWestern area). GENCO has been vested with MPSEB\u2019s generation assets and has taken over \ntheir operation, while TRANSCO has become the sole transmission company in the state. The \nbulk power trading function was transferred from MPSEB to the three DISCOMs. The most \nrecently incorporated company is the power trade company (TRADECO), which took over the \nrole of single electricity buyer and seller from MPSEB in June 2006.  \n \n10.  Although MPSEB retains few functions and staff, it is still a key stakeholder in the sector \nas it manages cash flow for sector companies and retains the corporate planning function for \nthe sector through its corporate planning group. In June 2005, the companies started to operate \nindependently,  with  each  distribution  company  responsible  for  collections.  However,  these \ncollections are transferred to the escrow account of MPSEB, which is in charge of paying the \nliabilities of the companies. The year-end balance sheet for MPSEB as of 31 March 2005 takes \ninto account the restructuring intended by GOMP. MPSEB is completing accounts to 31 May \n2005,  which  represent  its  final  accounts.  Thereafter,  successor  companies  will  report \nseparately, with the final accounts for MPSEB representing the opening position for each of the \n ", "  Appendix 3  41 \ncompanies from 1 June 2005. The corporate planning group\u2019s role will diminish thereafter, \nalthough MPSEB plans to continue to manage cash flows until the cash deficit in the revenue \nearnings and expenditure requirements is resolved to the satisfaction of all companies.  \n \nFigure A3.1:  Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Structure \nEnergy Flow  MPERC\nRevenue Flow\nState Regulator\nCapital Flow\nPower Purchase & \nGENCO\nIPP\nGeneration Company\n  \nPPA\nPPA \nMPSEB TRADECO TRANSCO\nResidual of State  Trading  Transmission \nElectricity Board  Company Company\nCess/ED  Subsidy \nDISCOM-W DISCOM-C DISCOM-E \nDistribution  Distribution  Distribution \nGOMP  Company Company Company \nState Government \nConsumers\nNote: Taxable income of the operating companies goes to the Government.   \n  Source: ADB estimate \n  \n11.  State Regulatory Affairs. The Electricity Regulatory Commission Act, 1998, provided \nfor  the  establishment  of  central  and  state  electricity  regulatory  commissions.  The  primary \nobjective of these regulatory bodies was to introduce transparency and economically sound \nregulation to the sector, while improving the financial health of state electricity boards and \nelectricity utilities. Key functions of Madhya Pradesh Electricity Commission (MPERC) include (i) \nrationalization of electricity tariffs; (ii) regulation of power systems operation; (iii) reliability and \nquality standard setting; (iv) issuance of licenses and regulation of licensees; and (v) promotion \nof competition, efficiency, and economy in the electricity industry. MPERC determines tariffs for \nwholesale, bulk, grid, or retail electricity based on tariffs made to it, and determines the tariff \npayable for use of the intrastate transmission facilities. MPERC has the same powers as are \nvested in a civil court\u2014it can pass interim orders in any proceeding, hearing, or matter before it; \nsummon  books  and  accounts  related  to  generation,  transmission,  distribution  supply,  or \nutilization of electricity for examination; and impose penalties for contravention of provisions of \nlicensing. \n \n12.  Alternative Energy Board. The MP Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd., a state government entity, \nleads alternative energy development, including energy efficiency. This entity is responsible for \nverification of energy production and consumption.  \n ", "42  Appendix 3 \n \nD.  Madhya Pradesh Power Sector \n1.  Government Strategy \n13.  The provision of reliable, affordable electricity is a prerequisite for economic and social \ndevelopment in MP. GOMP is driving a power sector reform process with the core objective of \nstrengthening the ability of public and private entities to deliver such an electricity supply to all \nconsumers.  The  reforms  are  underpinned  by  a  realistic  investment  program,  designed  to \nremove current constraints and to meet forecast demand growth though capacity augmentation \nand loss reduction, as well as a regulatory regime that recognizes actual and reasonable \noperating costs in tariff setting and encourages efficient use of capital. During the Eleventh Plan \n2008\u20132012,  $5.3  billion  in  investments  are  planned,  divided  among  generation  (43%), \ntransmission (26%), and distribution (30%). GOMP has requested external financial assistance \nfor implementing critical parts of this investment program. \n \n2.  Capacity and Constraints \n14.  Generation. India\u2019s western region, which includes MP, has 37,000 MW of installed \ngenerating capacity. Coal-fired thermal plants account for 27,000 MW of this capacity. The \nWestern Region is an importer of capacity during peak periods and an exporter during off-peak \nperiods. Generation is predominantly thermal (74%), with coal-fired plants representing 58% of \ninstalled and available capacity; hydropower capacity represents 19%. The GOMP power sector \nroad map under the Eleventh Plan 2008\u20132012 is predicated on an increase in the percentage of \nhydropower in the generation mix, improvement in the plant factors of thermal stations, and loss \nreduction through targeted investments in transmission and distribution. \n \n15.  MP has suffered from chronic peak capacity and energy shortages in recent years. The \npeak deficit has exceeded 20% and the energy deficit has been about 13% for the past 3 years. \nInstalled capacity in or available to MP is about 6,300 MW, with GENCO owning and operating \nabout 3,000 MW. Generating capacity available to meet peak demand is significantly less than \ninstalled capacity (Table A3.1). \n \nTable A3.1: Peak Generating Capacity Available to Madhya Pradesh \n(MW) \nSector  Hydro Thermal Current  Planned  Planned \nTotal Additions  Capacity \nFY07  31/3/07\nState  (MW)  733 1,718 2,451 71 2,522\nPrivate / JV  1,399 222  1,621\nCentral (MP Share)  1,396 86 1,482\nEastern Region Electricity Board (EREB)  43 0 43\nTOTAL  5,289 379  5,668\n \nJoint Venture (JV) \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates \n \n16.  Based on consistent growth in the national and state economy, as well as moderate \nincreases in tariffs to bring them in line with the true cost of supply, unrestricted consumer \ndemand for energy in MP is forecast to increase at 7% a year during the Eleventh Plan 2008\u2013\n2012. This means that approximately 17,000 gigawatt-hour (GWh) of additional demand will be \nadded by early 2012. With total energy losses currently at about 41%, more than 6,000 MW of \n ", "  Appendix 3  43 \npeak generation and network capacity would need to be added over the next 5 years to serve \nthis demand.  \n \n17.  MP\u2019s  power  sector  investment  program  is  predicated  on  a  significant  reduction  in \ntechnical and commercial losses, which would reduce the additional capacity requirement by \nmore than 1,000 MW and return to a capacity and energy surplus by 2011. Meeting peak \ndemand  is  problematic  and  expensive,  given  the  short  duration  and  nature  of  the  peak. \nConsequently, planned new generation is mostly base- and mid-load thermal plants.  \n \n18.  The Electricity Act, 2003 enables a competitive power market for all sector players, \nincluding generation companies, to expand their market base. As generation is de-licensed, \nmajor competition is expected from independent power producers, merchant plants, and captive \nplants in addition to initiatives from the existing plants inside and outside states where they are \nlocated to increase their market share. GENCO\u2019s past and projected performance is open to the \nscrutiny of potential competitors, many of which could be in a position to cherry-pick the most \nprofitable bilateral power wholesaling opportunities. New entrants benefit from considerably \nmore flexibility in choosing and timing their investments to respond to the market\u2019s new and \nevolving needs. GENCO must improve its performance to take on the competition from other \nplayers entering into the market, and to move away from being an asset-driven company to one \nwith a commodity and trading focus. \n \n19.  Transmission. Since 2002, transmission circuit length has increased almost 14%, while \ntransformation capacity has risen 41%. Consequently, transmission losses have been reduced \nto an acceptable level of around 5%, and availability of the transmission network has exceeded \n98% for the past year. However, due to continued growth in demand, the transmission capacity \nis inadequate to serve peak demand. During 2006, the transmission system served a record \nmaximum demand of 5,780 MW. The peak demand is expected to grow on average about 9% \nto  2012.  The  transmission  system  is  connected  with  all  neighboring  states:  Chhattisgarh, \nGujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh.. TRANSCO has 382 connection points \nwith  DISCOMs  and  43  connection  points  with  GENCO  at  the  outgoing  feeders  of  power \nstations.  \n \n20.  Notwithstanding  the  obvious  short-  and  long-term  need  for  investment  to  increase \ncapacity,  the  transmission  system  is  in  good  condition,  maintains  acceptable  voltage  and \nstability levels most of the time, and has reasonable levels of losses. The challenge\u2014and the \nopportunity\u2014is to ensure that transmission standards do not slip in the face of ramping demand, \nincreasing generation levels, and the additional uncertainty that open access and reduced \ncentralized planning impose on the transmission operator.  \n \n21.  With the advent of nondiscriminatory open access, TRANSCO is receiving capacity \nbuilding assistance, funded by Department for International Development of the United Kingdom \n(DFID), to (i) improve the reliability and availability of its network, (ii) increase its understanding \nof network technical capacity under normal and contingency conditions, (iii) introduce balancing \nand settlement mechanisms, and (iv) improve its ability to meter and account for transmission \ntransactions. \n \n22.  Distribution. The sector road map targets 100% village electrification by 2008 and \n100%  household  electrification  by  2012.  This  requirement  increases  the  burden  on  MP\u2019s \nDISCOMs to meet forecast demand growth, reduce losses, and improve reliability of supply. \nPerformance in these areas has been poor, and historical investment has failed to keep pace \nwith growth. Losses for DISCOMs still exceed 35%, power transformer capacity is inadequate to \n ", "44  Appendix 3 \nmeet diversified demand on 11 kilovolt (kV) feeders in many areas, 33 kV and 11 kV feeders are \nbeing loaded in excess of thermal limits, and distribution failure rates are about 19%. Power \nquality is poor due to undersized conductors, long Low Voltage (LV) circuits, and distribution \ntransformer  overloading.  The  introduction  of  computerized  power  systems  analysis  has \nunderscored the widespread nature of these problems throughout the state. \n \n23.  Inadequate  maintenance  practices  and  poor  installation  of  equipment  have \ncompromised  safety  on  the  networks  of  the  three  DISCOMs.  Losses  arising  from  poorly \nexecuted connections at distribution transformers are suspected to be far higher than normal. \nWhile improving and modernizing these practices will be a challenge, it is essential if targeted \nsystems and corporate performance improvements are to be realized. \n \n3.  Investment Program \n24.  In summary, the power sector faces the following challenges: (i) generation capacity is \ninsufficient to meet peak demand, necessitating scheduled and unscheduled load shedding, \nwhich  constitutes  a  major  impediment  to  economic  development  in  MP;  (ii)  transmission \ncapacity is barely adequate and security of supply is at risk; and (iii) the absence of a framework \nfor long-term distribution planning and a lack of funding has led to significant underinvestment in \nthe distribution network and poor maintenance of equipment. Consequently, the network is \noverstretched, losses are high, and reliability and quality of supply is poor. \n \n25.  The economic performance of MP has lagged that of India in recent years. Gross state \nproduct grew at 2.5% in 2004\u20132005, compared with Indian gross domestic product growth of \nabout  7%. Energy  intensity  of  output  is  also  relatively  low  compared  to  the  rest  of  India. \nHowever, forecasts indicate a significant improvement in MP\u2019s economic performance, which is \nexpected to match or exceed that of neighboring states during the Eleventh Plan 2008\u20132012. \nThis, in turn, will drive strong growth in electricity demand. The objective of full household \nelectrification by 2012 is expected to generate further growth in electricity demand. Table A3.2 \nsummarizes demand projections through the end of the Eleventh Plan.  \n \nTable A3.2: Demand Projections per Eleventh Plan  \n(GWh) \nEleventh Plan\n2007 2008 2009 2010  2011 2012\nForecast demand (including T & D losses)  39,183 41,808 44,943 48,545  52,114 55,142\nAnnual growth  6.7% 7.5% 8.0%  7.4% 5.8%\nCAGR  7.1%\n \nCAGR = , GWh = giga watt, T & D = Transmission and Distribution \nSource: ADB estimate \n \n26.  To meet this demand growth and to reinforce existing system constraints, an investment \nof approximately Rs248 billion ($5.3 billion) will be required. Investments are closely linked\u2014the \ngeneration requirement is predicated on loss-reduction targets at the distribution level being \nachieved, while the transmission investment is driven by the requirement to evacuate power \nfrom new generating plants, and to supply peak capacity to distribution off-take points. In this \ncontext,  investment  plan  components  are  interdependent,  and  the  timing  of  physical \nimplementation is important if purported benefits are to be delivered. \n \n \n ", "  Appendix 4  45 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE TO THE POWER SECTOR  \n \n1.  India\u2019s power sector has received a major portion of its external assistance from the \nAsian  Development  Bank  (ADB),  the  Canadian  International  Development  Agency,  the \nDepartment  for  International  Development  of  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation, Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau of the Government of Germany, the \nUnited States Agency for International Development, and the World Bank.

Introduction \n1.  The financial analysis of the proposed subprojects under Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 has \nbeen  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  Asian  Development  Bank\u2019s  (ADB)  Financial \nManagement and Analysis of Projects. The financial evaluation covers Madhya Pradesh Power \nTransmission  Company  Limited  (TRANSCO)  and  Madhya  Pradesh  Poorv  Kshetra  Vidyut \nVitaran Company Limited (DISCOM-E). All financial costs and benefits have been expressed in \nconstant 2006 prices. Cost streams used for the purposes of determining the financial internal \nrate  of  return  (FIRR)\u2014i.e.,  capital  investment,  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M),  and \nadministration\u2014are those costs of delivering the estimated benefits. The weighted average \ncosts of capital (WACC) of TRANSCO for the proposed subprojects under Tranche 1 and of \nDISCOM-E for the proposed subprojects under Tranche 2 also were calculated. These were \ncompared with the FIRRs to ascertain the financial viability of the subprojects. The sensitivity of \nthe FIRR to adverse movements in the underlying assumptions also was assessed. Based on \nthis analysis, the investment program under Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 is financially viable.  \n \nB.  Tariff Policy \n2.  In compliance with the National Electricity Policy (NEP), Madhya Pradesh Electricity \nRegulatory Commission (MPERC) promulgated in 2006 a distribution and retail tariff order for \n2007, as well as the first multiyear tariff (MYT) order for generation and transmission covering \n2007\u20132009. MPERC requires TRANSCO to base its tariff on full cost recovery of the loan \ninterest  costs,  depreciation,  return  on  equity,  (O&M)  expenses,  administrative  and  general \nexpenses, repair and maintenance expenses, interest on working capital, MPERC fee, and \nincome taxes. For distribution, MPERC has approved the full cost recovery tariff for 2007 \n(Rs3.49 per unit on average), with the MYT for distribution to be approved by March 2007 for \n2008\u20132010. Given the proper implementation of the tariff policy, TRANSCO is projected to \nmaintain profitability over the years, while DISCOM-E will achieve profitability by 2008. \n \nC.  Methodology and Assumptions \n3.  Incremental costs and benefits were computed based on \u201cwith\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d project \nscenarios for each of the components. The costs of each component include land acquisition, \ncivil works, equipment, incremental operating and maintenance costs, and distribution cost. \nTaxes and duties were included, while price contingencies and interest during construction were \nexcluded. The anticipated capital mix of debt and equity was used for estimating the WACC for \neach component.  \n \n4.  TRANSCO charges a one-part (Rs/Mega Watt/month) uniform tariff for access to its \ntransmission network. This tariff is determined based on full cost recovery and an adequate \nreturn on investment. Therefore, the projected financial benefit stream for TRANSCO is simply \nthe recovery of allowable expenses\u2014primarily additions to its asset base.1 Since tax is a tariff \npass-through item, financial analysis for TRANSCO was carried out on a pre-tax basis. \n \n                                                 \n1  Although TRANSCO is subject to MYT for FY2007\u20132009, it is entitled to petition MPERC to have assets added to \nits regulated asset base within the regulatory period, allowing it to earn revenue immediately on the new assets. In \nother words, TRANSCO does not need to wait until the subsequent regulatory period to have revenue-earning \nassets added to its asset base. \n ", "60  Appendix 9 \n \n5  For the distribution subprojects, the incremental financial benefits are the additional \nelectricity sold and reduced electricity purchased, both of which arise from decreased losses, \nincreased  distribution  capacity,  and  improved  reliability.  In  some  cases,  subprojects  were \nascribed more specific benefits, including reduction in (O&M) costs. Cost of energy purchased \nand end-use tariffs, as set by MPERC in its determination for 2007 and those projected for \n2008\u20132016, were used to value benefits.  \n \n6.  Capital costs were estimated in Indian rupees using a basket of tender prices submitted \nduring  2005  and  2006.  An  allowance  of  10%  for  physical  contingencies  was  added.  The \nevaluation was undertaken over 20 years following commissioning with residual value assumed \nat year 20, based on estimated remaining physical life of assets. O&M costs were estimated at \n1.5%\u20132.0% of capital costs, although for some subprojects an expected reduction in O&M costs \nwas included as a benefit. \n \nD.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital  \n7.  The WACC is calculated for the ADB projects in Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 during 2007\u2013\n2012 (Tables A9.1 and A9.2). For estimating WACC, ADB is assumed to finance 63% of \nTRANSCO and 57% of DISCOM-E subprojects costs through proposed Tranche 1 and Tranche \n2. The Government would onlend the funds with the same duration, 20 years with a 5-year \ngrace period, in rupees to GOMP, which would onlend to TRANSCO at 6.8%. TRANSCO and \nDISCOM-E will bear the foreign exchange risk. The balance will be financed through Power \nFinance Corporation at an interest rate of 10.5%, internal funds, and GOMP equity. The cost of \nequity is assumed as per MPERC allowance of 14% in the case of TRANSCO and DISCOM-E. \nA domestic inflation rate of 5.4% also is assumed. The pretax WACC for TRANSCO, therefore, \nis estimated at 3.4%. Income tax is a pass-through item based on actual tax payments. In the \ncase of DISCOM-E, the after-tax WACC assuming a corporate income rate of 30% is 2.3% \n \nTable A9.1: Weighted Average Cost of Capital for TRANSCO  \nItem  Amount  Weigh  Nominal  Tax Adj.

Risk Assessment \n1.  External Risks \n9.  Regulatory or tariff revisions risk for Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 are minimal. The current \ntariff has taken the investment plan into account. If necessary, regulated entities can submit \nrevised asset capitalization and financing plans, and MPERC  will adjust the determination \naccordingly. The risk of tariffs being lowered does not exit, because they will not be changed \n ", "62  Appendix 9 \n \nunless MPERC is petitioned by the regulated entities to do so. Volume (i.e., demand) risk is \nminimal since the current system is peak-constrained and energy-constrained. Loss-reduction \ntargets, while aggressive, are realistic as long as the proposed investment program proceeds. \nGeopolitical and political risks are present for all projects in India. However, the number and \nnature of investments, and their geographical spread, diversifies this risk. Therefore, the overall \nrisk to the financial sustainability of TRANSCO and DISCOM-E is deemed to be minimal. \n \n2.  Project-Specific Risks \n10.  Financial risks at the subproject level include increases in prices of equipment, delays in \nproject implementation, and failure to gain access to necessary counterpart funds. These risks \nare considered low for the following reasons: (i) the cost estimates were based on recent \ntenders received, and advanced procurement will lessen the time between loan effectiveness \nand disbursement; (ii) TRANSCO\u2019s implementation capacity is proven based on the past ADB \nproject, while DISCOM-E\u2019s implementation capacity might require support as the staff have \nlimited experience implementing ADB projects; (iii) although TRANSCO and DISCOM-E have \nnot become fully independent in terms of cash flow management, the financial projections \ndemonstrate satisfactory cash flows from 2008 to meet the repayment of debt associated with \nthe investment.  \n \nG.  Sensitivity Analysis \n11.  Separate analyses were carried out for TRANSCO and DISCOM-E to examine the \nsensitivity of the FIRR and net present value to adverse changes in key variables. The variables \nconsidered for the sensitivity analyses were (i) 10% increase in capital costs, (ii) 10% increase \nin O&M costs, (iii) 10% decrease in revenues (allowable costs), (iv) 2-year implementation delay \nwith a 20% increase in costs, and (v) no allowance for residual values.

Reforms in the Madhya Pradesh (MP) power sector have been undertaken. The Madhya \nPradesh  State  Electricity  Board  (MPSEB)  has  been  unbundled  into  six  new  power  sector \ncompanies for generation, transmission, distribution, and most recently for trading. In 2003, \nGovernment of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) prepared a financial restructuring plan to make the \nsector financially healthy. GOMP restructured the sector by injecting equity and taking over loan \narrears and in lieu of rural electrification loans and subsidy arrears. Assets were transferred, \nwhile commercial and contractual mechanisms were set up. In June 2005, opening balance \nsheets  for  each  new  company  were  established,  and  the  companies  started  to  operate \nindependently. The companies are still operating under the accounting system inherited from \nMPSEB, as required by the Electricity Supply Act, 1948; and annual statement of accounts are \nprepared  following  the  Electricity  Supply  Annual  Account  Rules,  1985  (ESAAR).  Per  the \nCompanies Act 1956, the new companies are required to comply with the Indian Accounting \nStandards. As such, they must prepare the annual financial statements an accrual basis and file \naudited accounts within 6 months of the financial year. \n \n2.  The sector companies are still in transition, moving from reporting under ESAAR to \ncomplying with new requirements. After the sector reforms, GOMP undertook a diagnostic \nneeds assessment of the financial management structure capability of the companies, which \nidentified technical, commercial, financial, and management constraints in the power sector. \nKey  areas  recognized included  the  design  and  implementation  of  a  \u201cbackbone\u201d  enterprise \nresource planning system covering billing and collection, finance and accounting, metering data \nmanagement and management information systems, materials management, project systems, \nhuman resources and e-mail solutions, and appropriate network infrastructure and support. The \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) verified the needs assessment with financial management \nassessment  questionnaires  completed  by  each  sector  company.  ADB  supports  short-term \ninitiatives  undertaken  by  the  companies:  the  request 1   of  new  billing,  accounting,  and \nmanagement information systems typical for commercial power utilities operations, which will \nallow the companies to be ready for the proposed ADB investments. GOMP has requested \nassistance from the Department for International Development of the United Kingdom (DFID) to \naddress  the  identified  weaknesses.  A  nonphysical  investment  component  for  capacity \ndevelopment  is  being  provided, 2   complementing  ADB\u2019s  proposed  physical  investments. \nCapacity development covers (i) financial management through financial policies, cost and \nrevenue centers, planning, modeling, controls, and reporting; (ii) accounting systems, including \nspecification of long-term requirements and chart of accounts; (iii) human resource strategies, \nincluding  recruitment  procedures  and  supporting  mechanisms;  (iv)  materials  and  asset \nmaintenance management, project management, and technical applications; and (v) regulatory \nsupport with tariff filing applications. \n \n3  The  respective  executing  agencies  have  well-staffed  project  management  offices. \nTRANSCO implemented the previous ADB loan in a timely and efficient manner. Also under the \nESAAR system, the executing agencies\u2019 accounts, projects accounts, and audit opinion have \nbeen  complied  with.  The  proposed  short-term  initiatives  are  adequate.  The  financial \nmanagement  arrangements  proposed  by  GOMP  for  the  sector  companies  are  considered \nappropriate  for  proper  project  financial  management,  reporting,  and  implementation  of  the \nmultitranche financing facility. \n                                                 \n1 Tenders are being prepared with expected approval in January 2007. \n2 DFID is providing \u00a318.5 million in technical assistance (\u00a314.5 million) and financial assistance (\u00a34 million) from 2006 \nto 2010. \n ", "64  Appendix 11 \n \nPAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PROJECTIONS FOR SECTOR COMPANIES \n \nA.  Introduction \n1.  A  vertically  integrated  monopoly,  the  Madhya  Pradesh  Electricity  Board  (MPEB), \noperated the Madhya Pradesh (MP) power sector. In the early 1990s, MPEB faced negative \nbalance sheets, increases in transmission and distribution losses, power shortages, and poor \nquality of power supply. Since 1992, it was unable to reach the minimum return of 3% on fixed \nassets, as required by the Electricity Supply Act, 1948. In 2000, when the state of Chhattisgarh \nwas carved out of Madhya Pradesh, the MP State Electricity Board (MPSEB) was created. \nMPEB assets and project-related liabilities were allocated geographically, while non-project-\nrelated liabilities were distributed base on the population. MPSEB assumed about 79% of the \nlong-term debt, 67% of the revenue base, and 94% of agricultural consumers, with excess \npower generation allocated to the Chhattisgarh state. This imbalanced allocation worsened \nMPSEB\u2019s  financial  position  as  follows:  (i)  estimated  transmission  and  distribution  losses \nreached about 49% in 2001, (ii) per unit cost of generation increased, and (iii) unfavorable \nconsumer  mix,  and  consequently  lower  average  realization  per  unit  compared  to  the \nChhattisgarh State Electricity Board, resulted. The series of the power sector reforms by the \ngovernment of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP), supported by the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) \nMadhya  Pradesh  Power  Sector  Development  Program  (MPPSDP),  helped  to  improve  the \nfinancial position of the MP power sector. \n \nB.  Past Financial Performance \n2.  The MP power sector has reduced financial losses from Rs13.71 million in 2002 to \nRs2.680 billion in 2005. The improvement of the financial situation is attributable to an increase \nin sales in 2001\u20132005, and of a decline in interest charges as a result of the positive impact of \nthe power sector financial restructuring. The financial improvements were demonstrated by \nactual results compared with those forecasted in the 2001 report and recommendation of the \nPresident for the Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Development Program.  The forecasted loss \nlevel in 2002 was much lower than projected, and the debt to debt-plus-equity ratio declined \nfrom 103% in 2001 to 57% in 2005. Prior period adjustments of Rs15.119 billion resulted in a \nsubstantial increase in cash in 2005, allowing a decline in accumulated losses to Rs9.492 billion \ncompared with Rs23.614 billion in 2004. In 2005, retirement of Rs35.149 billion of capital \narrears and an equity injection by GOMP of Rs44.125 billion allowed reduction of debt and \nsignificant strengthening of the balance sheet before transfer of assets and liabilities to the new \nsector companies. Even with an improvement in the financial situation over this period, MPSEB \nhas not been able to achieve profitability because of (i) insufficient tariff to cover the cost of \nsupply; (ii) non-remunerative investments in rural electrification schemes for the purpose of \nserving the social obligations of GOMP; (iii) tariff subsidy from GOMP was received mostly \nthrough adjustments than cash in the early years, aggravating the poor cash flow; (iv) high \ncommercial and technical losses in distribution; and (v) lower plant load factor and high station \nheat rate of its generating plants. The past performance of MPSEB is in Table A11.1.  \n \n ", "Appendix 11  65 \nC.  Opening Balance Sheets of the Companies \n3.  MPSEB allocated assets and liabilities to the individual companies as of 31 May 2005.1 \nAs these balance sheets were only provisional, they were not based on the year-end balance \nsheets of MPSEB as at 31 March 2005. MPSEB has undertaken to provide the operating \ncompanies a final balance sheet by 30 November 2006. The Corporate Planning Group of \nMPSEB anticipated little change in the opening balance sheets, except that MPSEB-allocated \nloans might increase by Rs500 million, spread equally among the companies. Madhya Pradesh \nElectricity Regulatory Commission has used the companies\u2019 opening fixed assets and work in \nprogress (as of 31 May 2005) to determine the allocation of equity and loans between fixed \nassets in operation and work in progress. In some instances, however, the companies claim that \nassets at that date have been put into service and should be allowed to expense rather than \ncapitalize interest and claim a return to equity.  \n \nD.  Financial Projections of Executing Agencies \n4.  This section sets out the financial projections for the executing agencies. The inflation \nand exchange rate assumptions are ADB estimates. Domestic inflation is projected at 5.5% for \n2006, 4.5% for 2007, 4.3% for 2008, and 4.1% from 2009 on. International inflation is assumed \nat  1.6%  for  2006,  2.8%  for  2007,  and  1.2%  from  2008  on.  Foreign  exchange  costs  are \nforecasted  to  decline  by  the  international  and  domestic  inflation  differential  2  to  maintain \npurchasing power parity, and are converted to the Indian rupees by the exchange rate of the \ndraw year. \n \n5.  Madhya  Pradesh  Transmission  Company  Limited  (TRANSCO).  The  company\u2019s \nprofitability is expected to grow in line with improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of \nits operational performance, moving toward the return on equity ceiling of 14% allowed under \nthe current regulations. The project funding will enable TRANSCO to undertake the planned \ninvestment. Projected financial performance indicators improve over the forecast period and \nshow adequate debt service coverage throughout the project. Self-financing capacity improves \ntoward the end of the forecast period, indicating TRANSCO\u2019s capacity to meet at least 20% of \ncapital expenditures from internal sources from 2013 onward. From 2008 on, the debt service \ncoverage ratio will exceed 1.2 in all years, while the debt to debt-plus-equity ratio declines from \n67% in 2007 to 45% by 2016. The summary of TRANSCO\u2019s financial projections is in Table \nA11.2. \n \n6.  Madhya  Pradesh  DISCOM  East  Company  Limited  (DISCOM-E).  DISCOM-E\u2019s \nfinancial  projections  show  that,  with  the  progressive  tariff  increases approved  by  MPERC, \nprofitability will be achieved by 2008. DISCOM-E\u2019s return on equity will be positive from 2008 \non, while return on average net fixed assets will increases to 13.7% in 2008 and remain above \n16% thereafter. Debt to debt-plus-equity ratio is forecasted to fall from 68.3% in 2006 to 39.6% \nby 2012, and then to 24.4% by 2016. ADB would fund about 56% of the proposed projects, with \nthe balance to be funded by internal funds, equity injections by GOMP, and Power Finance \nCorporation at 10.5% interest repayable over 10 years. With the proposed tariffs, cash flow is \nstrong, and the debt service ratio is expected to exceed 1.3 in all years. The self-financing \ncapacity exceeds 20% from 2009. Cash available from operations more than doubles from \nRs2.089 billion in 2008 to Rs4.342 billion in 2016, with debt service increasing from Rs1.593 \n                                                 \n1 This balance sheet is without considering the impact of the Government order, dated 4 November 2004, on the \nMPSEB/ Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board split as it is being contested by MPSEB and GOMP in the Supreme \nCourt. \n2  Assuming all other assumptions do not change. \n ", "66  Appendix 11 \n \nbillion to Rs3.037 billion over the same period. Capital expenditures decline from Rs8.753 billion \nin 2008 to Rs4.342 billion in 2016. The decline in capital expenditure is the result of the \ncompletion of the national rural electrification program with 100% rural electrification achieved \nby 2009 and the bulk of the states distribution network in place.

The \nevaluation  covers  Tranche  1  for  Madhya  Pradesh  Power  Transmission  Company  Limited \n(TRANSCO),  and  Tranche  2  for  Madhya  Pradesh  Poorv  Kshetra  Vidyut  Vitaran  Company \nLimited (DISCOM-E). All costs and benefits have been expressed at a constant 2006 prices. A \ndomestic price numeraire was used; tradable inputs were valued at their border price equivalent \nand converted into domestic equivalents using an estimated standard exchange rate factor \n(SERF)  of  1.05.  Capital  costs  included  physical  contingencies,  but  excluded  taxes,  price \ncontingencies, and financial charges during construction. \n \nB.  Project Benefits  \n2.  The main economic benefits of the subprojects in Madhya Pradesh (MP) are displaced \nthermal  electricity  generation  and  incremental  consumption.  These  benefits  arise  from  a \nreduction in technical and non technical losses, removal of network constraints, and improved \nreliability of supply. Benefits were quantified through load flow analyses and from pilot studies \nin other states. Demand forecasts, prepared by TRANSCO with input from DISCOMs, were \nbased on projections of historical sales data, modified by population growth, the impact of real \ntariff increases, and the impact of real increases in household income. \n \n3.  Detailed analysis by TRANSCO confirmed that the transmission component is the least-\ncost transmission solution to achieve the desired outcomes. It confirmed that the transmission \ncomponent  was  overall  least-cost  by  comparing  the  discounted  cost  with  an  equivalent \ngeneration project\u2014i.e., an electricity generation plant or plants, built at or close to the load \ncenter, that would be capable of producing the same level of output as the savings in losses \nand incremental demand served that the transmission component of the Project delivers. At a \n12% discount rate, the leveled cost of the transmission project is approximately Rs1.3 per kWh. \nThis compares to the long-run marginal cost of the equivalent peak and off-peak plant (on a \nweighted average basis) of Rs3.1 per kWh. Transmission reinforcement, therefore, is the least-\ncost means of removing the peak constraints on the transmission network and reducing losses.  \n \n4.  No viable alternatives are available for 100% consumer metering, substation projection \nupgrading, and remote metering. In the case of High Voltage Distribution System (HVDS), \nDISCOM-E has confirmed that other means to achieve similar reductions in technical and \ncommercial losses have been explored, and HVDS has been identified as least-cost. The \ntransmission component is concerned primarily with relieving transmission constraints. The \ndistribution component focuses on making delivery more efficient on an isolated subproject \nbasis.  Therefore,  as  the  two  components  are  largely  independent,  they  were  analyzed \nseparately rather than using the systems approach. Non-incremental outputs from transmission \nand distribution components were valued at the resource cost savings that would accrue if the \nproject was to proceed. Analysis of the electrical capacity and energy demand and supply \nbalance in MP demonstrates that (i) any reduction in peak losses will result in incremental \ndemand being served in most years; and (ii) any reduction in off-peak load will mean that less \ngeneration will be required to serve the same level of demand, and will result in a resource cost \nsaving.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 1997 Guidelines for Economic Analysis of Projects. Manila \n ", "Appendix 12  69 \n \n5.  The marginal cost of electricity from coal-fired thermal plants represents the short-run \nmarginal cost of off-peak energy in MP. Marginal costs of existing coal plants were estimated \nbased on actual historical operating parameters contained in generating company\u2019s most recent \ntariff petition. Coal fuel was initially valued at its border price equivalent value (BPEV), based on \nthe World Bank\u2019s coal price forecast and adjusted for the generally lower quality of coal used for \npower generation in India. Loading and transport costs excluding were added to base coal \nprices to derive a 2007 BPEV of Rs2,400 per ton. A discounted average marginal generating \ncost of Rs1.9 per kWh for electricity delivered at the power station gate was calculated.   \n \n6.  Ideally, additional hydropower capacity or open cycle gas turbines would be added in the \nlonger term to cope with the growth in peak demand. In practice, however, the long lead times \nfor hydropower coupled with the additional development risk it poses, as well as the difficulties \nin securing long-term gas supply, have meant that few new peaking plants are planned. Instead, \nadditional thermal base load plant is being added, moving hydropower from mid-load and peak-\nload duty into dedicated peaking. Therefore, it has been assumed that the short-run marginal \ncost of peak energy is set by the marginal cost of coal-fired thermal plant and the long-run \nmarginal cost of peak energy by the life cycle cost of coal-fired thermal plant. International \nEnergy  Association2  and  Royal  Academy  of  Engineering3  data  were  used  to  establish \ninternational benchmarks for the performance and costs of modern thermal plant. Leveled life \ncycle cost of a new coal-fired plant was estimated to be Rs2.3 per kWh. \n \n7.  Incremental outputs were valued using consumers\u2019 estimated willingness to pay for \nincremental  consumption.  For  domestic  consumption,  a  semi-log  demand  function  was \nestimated, following the methodology outlined in ADB\u2019s Economic Relations Division Technical \nNote No. 3 \u201cMeasuring Willingness to Pay for Electricity.\u201d The demand function then was tested \nagainst MP data from earlier years and found to be a reasonable fit. Suppressed demand is \naround  13%  of  energy  demand.  Solving  the  demand  function  for  q  =  804  kWh  gives  a \nwillingness to pay for additional units of consumption of Rs3.03 per kWh. For other consumer \ncategories, the marginal tariff was taken as a conservative proxy for their willingness to pay. The \nweighted average willingness to pay for all MP consumers supplied at Low Voltage is Rs3.2 per \nkWh on this basis. For Medium Voltage customers the figure is Rs4.0 per kWh. \n \nC.  Estimation of Economic Internal Rate of Return \n8.  The project evaluation is based on a comparison of benefits and costs between the \nproject (base) case and the without project (alternative) case. A period of 25 years has been \nused for economic evaluation, including 3 years for construction. The detailed benefit-cost \ncalculations  show  that  the  transmission  and  distribution  components  are  expected  to  be \neconomically viable. The transmission component has an estimated Economic Internal Rate of \nReturn (EIRR) of 15.0%,4 and the combined distribution component an estimated EIRR of \n14.7%. Economic cost and benefit flows are in Table A12.1 for the transmission and distribution \ncomponents.  Detailed  benefit-cost  analysis  at  the  subproject  level  is  discussed  in \nSupplementary Appendix N. \n \n                                                 \n2  International Energy Agency (IEA). 2005.

The estimated EIRRs are conservative. Subprojects will improve significantly the quality \nof  supply  to  consumers  through  improved  voltage,  reduced  harmonic  content,  and  more \nconsistent frequency. Reliability will be improved through a reduction in nuisance tripping of \nlines  and  substations,  and  through  reduced  requirements  for  load  shedding.  However,  a \nvaluation of the improvement that supply quality and reliability would have on consumers\u2019 \nwillingness to pay for incremental consumption was not attempted. In other words, it was \nconservatively  assumed  that  consumers\u2019  demand  functions  would  not  change,  despite  a \nsignificant improvement in the overall quality of electricity that they receive. Moreover, the \nassumption of coal-fired thermal power stations as the displaced peaking plant does not reflect \nthe need in the longer term to construct gas or hydropower peaking plants to load-following \nduties during peak supply periods. \n \n10.  Care was taken to avoid \u201cdouble counting\u201d of benefits across the transmission and \ndistribution  components.  The  transmission  component  is  focused  primarily  on  relieving \ntransmission  network  constraints.  As  such,  benefits  are  largely  independent  of  work  on \nremoving  distribution  constraints.  Moreover,  general  expansion  of  distribution  networks  will \noccur  in  both  \u201cwith  (transmission)  project\u201d  and  \u201cwithout  (transmission)  project\u201d  cases. \nFurthermore, demand growth beyond the end of construction of the transmission component \nhas not been included in benefit quantification. In this context, the EIRR for the transmission \ncomponent is a conservative estimate. \n \n ", "Appendix 12  71 \n11.  The project would be effective in reducing poverty. A secure and predictable electricity \nsupply will enable social and economic benefits to materialize, as well as ensure improved \nconditions for schools, hospitals, and other social services.

Sensitivity and Risk Analysis \n13.  The  sensitivity  of  the  EIRR  to  various  input  assumptions  also  was  tested.  For  the \ntransmission and distribution components, EIRRs exceed the assumed hurdle rate of 12% for all \nsensitivities tested, except for the combined downside scenario for the transmission component. \nBased on these results, subprojects appear to be economically robust. The results are in Table \n12.2.

The \neconomy gains overall from the project, and the difference between the financial net present \nvalue and economic net present value is distributed between electricity consumers and the \nGovernment.  From  an  economic  perspective,  benefits  accrue  to  consumers  as  energy  is \nconsumed incrementally based on consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for this consumption. The \nbenefit of resource cost savings also accrue to consumers through lower electricity prices. The \nsum of these benefits is greater than the incremental transmission charges that would appear in \nconsumers\u2019 electricity bills. Therefore, consumers are net beneficiaries. The Government is a \nnet beneficiary of the difference between the financial and economic capital costs of the project. \nThe economic price of foreign exchange and the official exchange rate differ. A SERF of 1.05 \nhas been estimated for India, implying that foreign exchange costs have a higher economic than \nfinancial cost to the economy. However, taxes and duties collected on the foreign component of \nequipment purchases offset the loss accruing from the overvalued currency. Small gains and \nlosses to labor have been excluded from the analysis. \n \n16.  Financial benefits accrue to DISCOM-E as soon as new assets are brought into service, \nprincipally through increased electricity sales and reduced losses.

The economy gains overall from the project, and the difference between the financial net \npresent value and economic net present value is distributed between electricity consumers and \nthe Government. From an economic perspective, benefits accrue to consumers as energy is \nconsumed incrementally based on consumers\u2019 willingness to pay for this consumption. The \nbenefit of resource cost savings also accrue to consumers through lower electricity prices. The \nsum of these benefits is greater than incremental distribution and retail charges that would \nappear in consumers electricity bills. Therefore, consumers are net beneficiaries. Residential \nand agricultural consumers are the two consumers that suffer most from poor quality and \nunreliable  electricity  supply.  As  such,  they  would  benefit  the  most  from  the  project.  The \nGovernment is a net beneficiary of the difference between the financial and economic capital \ncosts of the project. The economic price of foreign exchange and the official exchange rate \ndiffer. A SERF of 1.05 has been estimated for India, implying that foreign exchange costs have \na higher economic than financial cost to the economy. However, taxes and duties collected on \nthe foreign component of equipment purchases offset the loss accruing from the overvalued \ncurrency. The Government also is a net beneficiary of the incremental income tax that would be \ngenerated. Small gains and losses to labor have been excluded from the analysis. \n \nE.  Conclusion \n17.  The economic analysis confirms that Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 subprojects are least-cost \nand economically viable. The analysis yields EIRRs of 15.0% for the transmission components \nand 14.7% for the distribution components. Sensitivity and risk analysis demonstrates that the \nexpected economic performance is robust. From an economic perspective, Tranche 1 and \nTranche 2 subprojects should proceed. \n \n ", "Appendix 13  73 \nSUMMARY INITIAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXAMINATION \nA.  Introduction \n1.  Environmental assessment of the proposed investments is being carried out following \nthe Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) Environment Policy (2002), Environmental Assessment \nGuidelines  (2003) 1 ,  and  the  Government\u2019s  environmental  assessment  regulations  and \nguidelines.2 The first and second tranche investments are classified as category B according to \nADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines. The executing agencies (EAs), TRANSCO and \nDISCOM,  have  prepared  initial  environmental  examinations  (IEE)  for  the  first  and  second \ntranche components. Environmental assessment also will be prepared in due course for the \nremaining  components  in  future  tranches.  This  summary  IEE  outlines  key  aspects  of  the \nproposed  investment  program,  environmental  benefits  and  negative  impacts,  proposed \nmitigation measures, and preliminary environmental management plan (EMP). \n \n2.  The  environmental  assessment  and  review  framework  (EARF)3  is  applicable  to  all \ninvestments funded by the multitranche financing facility, and particularly to projects included in \nsubsequent  tranches  that  have  not  been  fully  defined.  The  EARF  outlines  the  policy, \nprocedures, and institutional requirements for preparing subsequent projects. The EAs are \nresponsible  for  preparing  the  required  environmental  assessments  and  obtaining  ADB \nconcurrence before implementation. These approvals must be in place before contracts are \nfinalized and work begins.  \n \n3.  A  generic  EMP  in  matrix  form  that  will  apply  to  additional  subprojects  has  been \nprepared.4 The matrix is developed based on environmental analysis of the proposed Tranche 1 \nand Tranche 2 components and subprojects,5  as well as a review of environmental impacts of \ntypical power transmission and distribution projects. The mitigation measures for the additional \nsubprojects will be developed in the spirit of the principles agreed upon in this EMP framework. \n \nB.  Description of the Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Investment Program \n \n4.  The proposed Program will sustain the reform agenda established with earlier ADB \nsupport,  and  is  expected  to  help  to  attract  other  long-term  financiers  to  the  sector.  The \ninvestments to be supported by ADB will (i) improve the quality and reliability of power; (ii) \nremove transmission bottlenecks; (iii) facilitate in-state and interregional power transfers; (iv) \nfacilitate a reduction in overall system losses; (v) improve energy efficiency, expand renewable \nenergy capacity, and capitalize related carbon market opportunities; and (vi) improve utility \noperational and financial performance. \n  \n5.  Electricity Transmission Capacity Strengthening.  \n \n(i)  Tranche  1,  Transmission  Capacity  Expansion.  This  component  includes \nconstruction of (a) 2 circuit kilometers (cct-km) of 400 kV and 1,435 cct-km of \n220 kV transmission lines across MP; (b) eight new 220/132 kV substations, \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2003 Environmental Assessment Guidelines.

The distribution component \nwill undertake (a) construction of HVDS in six  distribution circles in the eastern \ndistribution zone of MP, including conversion of about 7,400 km of low-voltage \nlines  to  high-voltage  lines;  (b)  remote  metering  of  about  2,000  industrial \nconsumers; (c) metering of about 250,000 consumers; and (d) renovation of \nprotection system at about 100 substations. \n \nC.  Description of the Environment \n \n6.  Physical Resources. The project components are in various geographic regions of the \nstate,  covering  Bagel  Khand,  Bundel  Khand,  Chambal,  Mahakaushal,  Malwa  and  Nimar \nregions. Except for the Narmada river valley, the state consists of a plateau with mean elevation \nof about 500 meters above mean sea level, interspersed with mountains of the Satpura and the \nVindhya ranges. The Narmada is an MP lifeline, which runs from east to west between Vindhya \nand Satpura ranges. The project area is part of a peninsular plateau consisting of sedimentary \nand metamorphic rocks, and is structurally part of the peninsular block. The soil of the region is \nrich and fertile. MP has two agro-climatic zones: (i) Central Plateau & Hill Region, and (ii) \nWestern Plateau and Hill Region. Soil in the region is mainly black soil, ranging from shallow to \ndeep black. In addition to high reserves of coal, the state\u2019s other mineral resources include iron \nore, manganese, copper, bauxite, limestone, dolomite, rock phosphate, diamonds etc. The area \nis geologically stable and not prone to earthquakes. Agriculture dominates land use, with the \naverage area reported under forest cover at about 28%. Four major rivers crisscross MP: \nMahanadi, Narmada, Sone, and Tapti. Availability of water in the state is more than 81,000 \nmillion cubic meters (m3), of which approximately 56,857 million m3 (70%) had been utilized. \nSurface water commonly is used for all purposes. However, groundwater use is also common. \nThe  areas  directly  impacted  by  the  investment  components  do  not  have  any  sensitive, \nthreatened, or endangered species. The state has a tropical climate varying from dry subumid to \nsemiarid. Summers are hot (maximum temperature between 330C and 440C) and at some \nplaces it remains humid, while winters are reasonably comfortable (between 270C and 100C). \nThe monsoon season runs from June to September, with average rainfall of 1,000 millimeter \n(mm) in the west to 2,000 mm in the eastern part of state. Average air quality in the state is \ngood, except in a few urban and industrial centers, where air quality is deteriorated due to \nindustrial activities and transport sources.  \n \n7.  Ecological Resources. The total forest area in the state is about 9.77 million hectares, \nwhich constitutes 31.7% of total land area of MP. Of the forested area, 64% is legally reserved \nforest, 22% protected forest, and 14% unclassified forest. MP has nine national parks and 25 \nwildlife  sanctuaries,  covering  about  10,800  square  kilometers  (km2)  or  about  3.5%  of  the \ngeographic area of the state. However, none of the physical investment components is in these \nsensitive areas. The notable wildlife species reported are jackal, fox, monkey, wolf, squirrel, and \nreptiles. The common flora species are babul, chhola, jaria, keekar, neem, reonjha, etc. \n \n8.  Socioeconomic Conditions. The population of state exceeds 60 million,6 constituting \nabout 5.9 % of country\u2019s population. Average population density is about 196 persons per km2. \nAbout 73% of the population lives in rural areas. The literacy rate is nearly 65%. The economy \n                                                 \n6  Statistics are taken from **Author**. **Year of publication**.

Mineral resources and tourism also are contributing \nsignificantly to the state\u2019s economy. Per capacity income at current prices is about Rs5,926 per \nyear, and the net domestic product at current prices is about Rs41,572 crores (annual basis). \nAbout 95% of villages are electrified, nearly 24% villages have all-weather road connectivity, \nand about one third of the population has access to improved water supply. \n \nD.  Anticipated Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \n1.  Environmental Problems Due to Project Location and Design \n \n9.  In all project areas, the project components do not encroach upon ecologically important \nareas. They generally traverse barren land with minimum vegetative cover and agricultural \nareas. Preliminary route selection was based on the topographic sheets and forest atlas (forest \nmaps).  The  following  principles  were  adopted  for  selection  of  optimum  sites  for  project \ncomponents: (i) minimize disturbance of human settlements; (ii) avoid monuments of cultural or \nhistorical importance; (iii) do not create a threat to the survival of any community with special \nreference to tribal communities; (iv) do not affect any public utility services such as playgrounds, \nschools etc.; (v) do not pass through any sanctuaries, national parks, reserve forests etc.; (vi) \nminimize  damage  to  forest  resources;  (vii)  selection  new  equipment  (i.e.,  transformers, \ncapacitors, etc.) that comply with international standards, particularly with respect to avoiding \nuse  of  PCBs.  Site  selection  for  individual  lines  and  substations  is  undertaken  carefully. \nAlternative  alignments  and/or  locations  were  considered  to  ensure  that  the  disruption  to \nenvironmentally sensitive areas would be avoided or minimal. The land required for placing new \ntransmission towers is about 0.3 hectares, and for new substations is about 76.5 hectares. The \nland  required  is  mostly  government  and/or  agricultural  land,  and  will  be  compensated  per \nexisting norms. No land acquisition will be required for augmentation of substation capacity, \ninstallation of additional transformers and circuit breakers, and extension of feeder bays, etc. \nThe proposed project components do not pose any threat to other public utilities or wildlife.  \n \n2.  Environmental Effects During Construction \n \n10.  Minor disruption to farming activities, as well as disturbance of crops, bunds, canals, and \ndrains,  could  occur  during  construction  and  line  maintenance.  To  minimize  such  impacts, \nestablished roads and tracks will be used wherever possible, compensation will be paid for \ntemporary loss in agricultural production in accordance with the resettlement action plan, topsoil \nwill  be  protected  and  reinstated after  construction  is  completed,  and  damaged bunds  and \nirrigation facilities will be maintained in working condition throughout project implementation. \nTemporary  access  roads  might  be  needed  in  some  locations.  The  environmental  impacts \nassociated with the establishment of temporary access roads will include compaction of soil \nstructure  and  disruption  of  stream  or  other  water  bodies.  To  minimize  the  impact,  the \ncontractors will be required to limit the load of trucks in transporting construction equipment and \nmaterials. Uncontrolled soil erosion and silt runoff are likely to be minor due to the limited \namount of excavation required for towers and the dry climate. In addition, measures to minimize \nerosion and silt runoff will be incorporated into contract documents. Substations will be sited and \ndesigned to ensure noise level from fence will not exceed 70 dB(A) at any time. Construction \nwill generate noise for a short duration in predominantly rural locations, and is considered \ninsignificant. Other nuisances from construction activities will be mitigated through contract \nclauses  specifying  careful  construct  practices  and  compensation  paid  for  any  losses  in \nagricultural production. Escape of polluting material, such as oil and sewage, from construction \n ", "76  Appendix 13 \n \ncamps and substations will be prevented through design and installation of appropriate oil \ncontainment and sewerage systems. Hazardous waste generated from phased out equipment \nand/or batteries will be disposed off according to the norms of Ministry of Environment and \nForests. Health hazards from potential explosions or fire, electric shocks, and accidents to staff \nand the public will be minimized through implementation of measures such as (i) careful designs \nusing  appropriate  technologies  to  minimize  hazards,  (ii)  safety  awareness  raising  for \nconstruction and operational staff and the public, (iii) substations equipped with modern fire \ncontrol systems, (iv) provision of adequate water supply and sanitation facilities for substations \nand construction camps, (v) provision of adequate staff training in operations and maintenance, \nand (vi) security fences and barriers around substations and transmission towers in populated \nareas. \n \n3.  Environmental Effects During Operation  \n11.  During construction, 3-meter wide strips of land under each conductor will be cleared, \none of which will be kept clear as a maintenance right-of-way. The other strips will be allowed to \nbe afforested. Trees will be trimmed with the assistance of the state forest department to ensure \nthat the required vertical clearances from the top of tree to the conductor are maintained \nthroughout the transmission corridor. This will reduce the chances of forest fires due to electric \nsparks. Emissions from circuit breakers, which use sulphur hexafluoride (SF ), are a concern, \n6\nand have been evaluated in the context of possible opportunities under the Clean Development \nMechanism  (CDM).7  While  MPPTCL  has  investigated  phasing  out  SF ,  no  technological \n6\nsubstitute for SF  circuit breakers is ready. Emissions of SF  will be controlled by applying sound \n6 6\nengineering and management practices, including leak detection and repair, use of appropriate \nequipment for recycling, and orientation and training of employees. To minimize the risk of \naccidents and exposure to electric fields, houses will not be allowed within the right-of-way. \nGeneral awareness among people about potential risks due to high-voltage lines and safety \naspects should be raised. Table A13.1 summarizes the anticipated impacts during construction \nand operations. Overall, the project\u2019s minimal negative impacts can be mitigated cost effectively. \n \nTable A13.1: Project Impacts and Mitigation Measures \n \nTypes of  Impact Sources  Location of  Pollutant or  Treatment Measures \nImpacts   Sources  Parameter \nNoise:  Construction  Construction  70 dB(A) at site  Equipment to meet local \nConstruction  equipment and  sites,  boundary  noise standards; \nPeriod  equipment  maintenance  construction scheduling \nrepairing and  yard, and access  to avoid evening and \nmaintenance  roads  nighttime disruption \nNoise:  Transmission line  Outdoor  70 dB(A) at site  Locate facility 70\u2013100 m \nOperational  and associated  Switchyards  boundary   from nearest receptor; \nPeriod  substations  walls, fencing, and/or \ngreenbelt to provide \npartial sound barrier \nWastewater:  Domestic  Work site and  BOD, COD, fecal  Primary treatment if \nConstruction  wastewater  construction  coliform  needed by larger camps \nPeriod  camps \nIndustrial  Equipment  Petroleum and  Sedimentation and \nwastewater from  maintenance  detergent  biological treatment if \nconstruction  yards  necessary \nequipment \nmaintenance \n                                                 \n7 SF  is one of the six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol, but India is not subject to Kyoto emissions \n6\ncaps and SF is not regulated by the Government of India as a pollutant.  \n6 \n ", "Appendix 13  77 \nTypes of  Impact Sources  Location of  Pollutant or  Treatment Measures \nImpacts   Sources  Parameter \nWaste oil from  Construction  Mineral oil,  Reuse after filtration. \nphased out  sites and  possible oil with  Dispose off-site to \ntransformers and  maintenance  PCBs  registered vendors \nother equipment  yards \nWastewater:  Domestic  Substations and  BOD, COD, fecal  Primary treatment if \nOperational  wastewater  storage yard  coliform   needed \nPeriod  Industrial  Storage and  Temperature, pH,  Off-site disposal at \nwastewater and  maintenance  BOD, etc. to meet  licensed treatment facility, \noils from  yard  CPCB standards  or alternate on-site \ntransformer    for industrial  treatment as approved by \nreplacement  Transformers  wastewater  pollution control board \nbeing taken out   \nof service  Mineral oil; \npossible oil with \nPCBs \nAir Quality:  Dust during  Construction  Increase TSP, NO ,  Continuous management \n2\nConstruction  construction and  sites access  SO  levels at  measures to be imposed \n2\nPeriod  exhaust gases  roads and  construction sites,  at the construction sites \nfrom construction  surrounding  and surrounding \nmachinery and  areas  areas \nvehicles \nAir Quality:  Release of gases  Equipment or   GHGs in  Replace equipment or \nOperational  in receptors from  process using  atmosphere  process or system using \nPeriod  process,  CFCs and  CFCs, including halon, \nequipment  halons  and dispose off in manner \n  consistent with the \nrequirements of the \nGovernment \nSolid  Spoils from earth  Construction  Earth and domestic  Spoils to be used as base \nWastes:  moving;  sites and  solid waste  material for substations \nConstruction  construction debris  workers\u2019 camps  and greenbelts \nPeriod \n  Replaced  Storage yard  Pieces of phased  Dispose of in a manner \nequipment  out equipment  consistent with the \nGovernment\u2018s \nrequirements \nSolid  Garbage from  Substations and  Domestic solid  Disposed at facilities \nWastes:  substations and  storage yards  waste and/or  approved by local \nOperational  storage yards  process waste or  government pollution \nPeriod  scrap waste  control agencies \nBOD = biochemical oxygen demand, COD = chemical oxygen demand, dB(A) = decibel acoustic, NO  = nitrogen \n2\ndioxide, NO  = nitrogen oxides, PCB = polychlorinated biphenyl, SO  = sulfur dioxide, TSP = total suspended \nx 2\nparticles, CFC = chlorofluorocarbons, GHG = greenhouse gases. \nSource: Asian Development Bank assessment \n \n4.  Potential Cumulative and Induced Impacts \n12.  The proposed investment program does have potential cumulative and induced impacts, \nwhich are considered largely positive. Direct impacts result from acquisition of additional RoWs \nand land for transmission lines and substations, and improvements in power system efficiency. \nDistribution and transmission system efficiency improvements will result in energy savings of at \nleast 1,200 giga watt per hour (GWh) per year, with equivalent Carbon Dioxide (CO ) reduction \n2\nof more than 1 million tons per year. Indirect impacts include: (i) expansion of thermal power \ngeneration  base  (facilitated  by  the  transmission  and  distribution  system  investments);  (ii) \nincreased investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy; (iii) economic growth related \nto  improved  power  supplies;  and  (iv)  reallocation  of  government  funding  away  from  loss-\nincurring utility operations and toward social investment in education, health, water supply, and \nsanitation.  The  application  of  advanced  power  generation  technologies  and  renovation  of \n ", "78  Appendix 13 \n \nexisting power stations will offset partially thermal power expansion. If the full spectrum of \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy investments materialize, the potential savings are more \nthan 2,000 GWh per year and more than 2 million tons per year of CO  equivalent. \n2\n \n5.  Institutional Requirements and Environmental Management Plan \n \n13.  While the EAs have engineering and support staff, they have varying levels of dedicated \nstaff  and/or  full-time  qualified  personnel  with  environment  and  resettlement  expertise.  An \nenvironmental and social management unit, responsible for environment, resettlement, and any \nother social development obligations, will be established at each EA.8 All the EAs will assume \nprimary responsibility for the environmental assessment and implementation of EMPs for their \nrespective components. TRANSCO has an environmental and social management cell (ESMC) \nwithin its organization structure to deal with environmental and social issues. However, its \ncapacity needs to be strengthened by providing orientation and training on monitoring and \nimplementation of environmental good practices. A chief engineer (T&P) heads the ESMC cell, \nwhich has seven officers from T&P office, civil office, and EHT-wing. ESMC at TRANSCO will \nhave overall responsibility for implementation and monitoring of EMPs. The field organizations \nof EHT: C&M cell are carrying out the field studies. The field organizations of MPPTCL and DFO \nof the concerned district are conducting the EIA studies jointly. The ESMC is self-sufficient for \nmonitoring  the  program  and  submission  of  progress  reports.  However,  as  and  if  required \nservices of external agencies could be taken for monitoring and implementation of mitigation \nmeasures. Need for additional staff is not envisaged. \n \n14.  The duties of the environmental and social management unit will include at least: (i) \nmonitoring and implementing mitigation measures; (ii) preparing and implementing environment \npolicy guidelines and environmental good practices; (iii) advising and coordinating effective \nenvironment management; (iv) preparing an environment and safety manual for substation \noperation; (v) liaising with the Ministry of Environment Forest, New Delhi, and Pollution Control \nBoard, and seeking their help to solve the environment-related issues of project implementation; \n(vi) advising the project planning cell on environmental and social issues, while selecting routes \nfor the alignment at the planning stage to avoid negative environmental impacts; (vii) providing \ntraining  and  awareness  on  environmental  and  social  issues  related  to  power  transmission \nprojects to the project staff.  \n \n15.  The contractor will be responsible for implementation of mitigation measures during the \nconstruction stage. The environmental engineer of the environmental and social management \nunit will ensure inclusion of environmental mitigation measures in contract documents. ADB will \n(i) review and approve IEEs and EMPs before contracts are finalized and work begins; (ii) \nreview monitoring reports; and (iii) officially disclose the IEEs on its Web site in accordance with \nthe ADB Public Communications Policy (2005)9. The IEEs include EMPs that cover (i) summary \nof  potential  impacts,  (ii)  mitigation  measures,  (iii)  environmental  monitoring,  (iv)  public \nconsultation  processes,  (v)  outline  of  responsibilities  and  authorities  for  implementing  the \nproposed monitoring and mitigation activities, (vi) reporting and review procedures, (vii) work \nplan (including staffing and schedules of assigned personnel, activities, and inputs of other \ngovernment agencies and stakeholders), (viii) environmentally responsible procurement plan, \n(ix) cost estimates, and (x) mechanisms for feedback and adjustment.

Each IEE and EMP, and the summary IEE for the investment components, will be \ntranslated  into  local  language(s)  and  made  available  to  the  public.  A  grievance  redressal \ncommittee (GRC) will be established to address the concerns and grievances of the local \ncommunities and affected parties. Further, it will provide them with a public forum to raise their \nconcern or objections. The GRC will comprise representatives from project proponent, local \nauthorities,  affected  parties,  and  other  stakeholders,  as  mutually  agreed  with  the  local \nauthorities  and  affected  persons,  and  a  senior  official  from  each  EA.  The  GRC  will  be \nestablished in a manner that ensures easy access to communities and affected parties. The \nEAs will be responsible for disseminating information about the functional norms of the GRC. \nThe committee will meet at least twice per year, or more frequently if required. The EMPs will \ninclude provisions for internal and external monitoring. The EAs will be responsible for internal \nmonitoring  of  EMP  implementation,  and  will  forward  semiannual  progress  reports  to  the \nGovernment and ADB. The reports will cover EMP implementation with attention to compliance \nand any needed corrective actions. The EAs will hire an independent monitoring agency, with \nADB concurrence, to undertake external monitoring of the project. The external monitoring \nagency will be selected within 3 months of approval of each loan approval, and will report \nsemiannually  directly  to  ADB.  It  will  determine  whether  sound  environmental  management \npractices have been achieved, and suggest suitable recommendations and remedial measures \nfor midterm correction and improvement.  \n \nF.  Conclusion \n18.  None of the Tranche 1 and Tranch2 2 investment components are in environmentally \nsensitive  areas,  and  will  not  result  in  any  significant  adverse  impacts.  Minimal  negative \nenvironmental impacts are anticipated, mostly during construction. These can be mitigated \nsuccessfully by implementing component-specific EMPs. Environmental and social benefits of \nthe investment components and long-term program objectives outweigh the negative impacts. \nBased on environmental assessment activities conducted to date, the Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 \nprojects  are  confirmed  as  environmental  category  B  and  the  IEEs,  including  EMPs,  are \nconsidered sufficient to meet the environmental assessment requirements of ADB and India. A \nfull environmental impact assessment study is not required. \n                                                 \n11  Queries raised by people were answered to their satisfaction.

Country Poverty Partnership Agreement  \n \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to poverty reduction in India \n \nInfrastructure development is critical as a catalyst for generating economic activity and employment, \naccelerating growth, and providing better integration and social welfare. The power sector investment \nprogram in Madhya Pradesh will have intrinsic scope for poverty reduction. The investment program will \nbring direct and indirect positive social impacts. This will benefit specifically the people living in the remote \nareas through improved frequency and voltage levels for various uses, which will result in socioeconomic \ngrowth. Electricity is a key input for socioeconomic development process. Efficient and reliable provision of \nelectricity contributes indirectly to poverty reduction through economic growth. It also has a direct bearing \non poverty reduction as electricity access is central to the basic human needs of health and education. Poor \nand vulnerable consumers, as well as social utilities such as hospitals and schools, are often particularly \ndisadvantaged by inadequate power supply, load shedding, and poor power quality. Therefore, they will \nbenefit directly from the project. Direct positive economic and social benefits will result from the investment \nprogram. In addition, better supply of electricity will enable farmers to set up high-powered pump sets for \ntheir agricultural use, which will help increase yields. The proposed project is expected to generate \nconsiderable employment for skilled and unskilled labor during the construction. \n \nB.         Poverty Analysis                                                  Proposed Classification: General intervention \n   \nThe poverty level in Madhya Pradesh is, on average, higher than in the rest of India. This is indicative of \nthe degree of vulnerability and marginalization of the population. According to the National Sample Survey \n55th round, 37.43% of the population in the state lives in poverty. The poverty line in the state is set at \nRs311.34 per capita per month for rural areas and Rs481.65 per capita per month for urban areas. The \nnational poverty line is slightly higher for rural areas at Rs327.66 per month, but lower for urban areas at \nRs454.11 per month. However, the national and the state poverty lines are well below the internationally \naccepted $1 a day poverty line, highlighting the vulnerability of population. According to the Human \nDevelopment Report, the poverty level in the rural areas has fallen from 40.6% in 1993\u20131994 to 37.1% in \n1999\u20132000, as per the head count ratio in Madhya Pradesh. The literacy rate is 64.11% of the total \npopulation. Of the literate population, 76.80% is male and 50.28% is female. Of the total households, 74% \nare in rural areas and 26% in urban areas. Net sown area under agriculture is 49%, and forest land covers \nabout 28% of the geographic area. Of the total population, 57% is classified as nonworkers and 32% are \nmain workers, whereas 11% is marginal workers.  \n \nThe sample subprojects will create significant employment opportunities for skilled and unskilled labor \nduring implementation. Unskilled labor will be employed directly for the construction of transmission lines, \nsubstations,  and  other  manual  works.  The  post-construction  phase  also  will  offer  opportunities  for \nemployment, especially for maintenance \n \nC.

Public consultations were carried \nout as an integral component of project preparation to ensure that the community supports the project \nand the project supports the needs of the people. The stakeholders and the affected community were \ncontinuously involved, and their feedback has led to substantial inputs into project preparation. While the \nproject authority retains the decision-making authority, interaction with people and their feedback allows \naffected populations to influence the decision-making process by raising issues that should be considered \nin design, mitigation, monitoring, and management plans, as well as the analysis of alternatives. The \nexecuting agencies (EA)will ensure that during implementation local groups will remain involved in (i) \npreparing final compensation listings and individual claim files and in the payment of compensation for \nacquired land and loss of assets and livelihood; and participate in any grievance redress; and (iv) the \nM&E process during implementation of the resettlement plan. \n \n \nD.

Each tranche will be structured as a project loan \nthat can be implemented fully within 3 to 4 years. The Investment Program will cover the \nfollowing three areas: \n \n(i)  Transmission  capacity  expansion.  Time-critical  transmission  lines, \nsubstations, and auxiliary equipment will be constructed to evacuate and \ntransmit power from new power stations and substations to consumers. \nThe scope of transmission work will comprise construction of (a) 2 cct-km \nof 400 kV and about 1,435 cct-km of 220 kV transmission lines across the \nstate; (b) eight new 220/132 kV substations, with transformer capacity of \n160 MVA each; and (c) one new 400/220/132 kV substation with 315 \nMVA transformer capacity. \n(ii)  Distribution  efficiency  enhancement. Various targeted capital works \ndesigned to improve efficiency through loss reduction and to enhance \nsupply reliability in all DISCOMs will be undertaken. Subprojects include \nthe  rollout  of  a  HVDS;  remote  metering  of  high-value  customers; \n(metering of unmetered consumers; distribution transformers metering; \nrenovation  of  substation  protection  and  modernization  of  substations; \nsubstation  SCADA;  and  the  expansion  of  the  village  lighting  scheme \n(feeder separation scheme).  \n(iii)  Nonphysical  investments.

The major impacts will involve temporary land acquisition for the transmission \nlines, which will affect some private land. Per the detailed project report (DPR), 18 of the \n19 proposed substations will be built in the government land. The remaining substation \n(Chicholi) will require minimal private land acquisition. The assessment has been done \nfor the transmission lines for Tranche 1. Land acquisition and resettlement impacts have \nbeen assessed and documented in the RP for the transmission lines and substations \nunder  Tranche  1.  The  construction  of  transmission  lines  will  require  the  temporary \nacquisition of 611.3049 hectares of private agricultural land, which will result in 1,52850 \ntemporarily affected households.

Of the total population, 57% are classified as nonworkers, 32% as \nmain workers, and 11% as workers. According to the National Sample Survey 55th \nround, 37.43% of the state\u2019s population lives in poverty. \n \nC.  Indigenous People \n \n5.  The  project  will  not  affect  any  indigenous  people.  MP\u2019s  scheduled  tribe \npopulation is 12,233,474, or 20.3 % of the state population. An Indigenous People\u2019s \nDevelopment Framework (IPDF) has been prepared for management of Indigenous \nPeople (IP) issues if occurs in the future. \n \nD.  Policy Framework and Entitlements \n \n6.  This RP is based on the Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB) policy on Involuntary \nResettlement (1995), as well as on the Government\u2019s domestic laws, particularly Land \nAcquisition  Act  of  1894  (Govt  of  India);  National  Policy  on  Resettlement  and \nRehabilitation  for  Project  Affected  Persons  (NPRR)  by  the  Ministry  of  Rural \nDevelopment, 2003; and The Madhya Pradesh Resettlement Policy, 2002.  \n \n7.  National  Policy  on  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation.  The  basis  of  the \nGovernment\u2019s resettlement policy is the NPRR, which provides minimum conditions \nensured for persons affected by acquisition of land for public purposes. The objectives of \nthe policy are to (i) minimize displacement and identify non-displacing or least-displacing \nalternatives; (ii) plan resettlement and rehabilitation of project-affected families (PAF), \nconsidering special needs of tribal and vulnerable sections; (iii) provide a better standard \nof living for PAFs; and (iv) facilitate cooperation between the project proponent and \nPAFs.  The  Land  Acquisition  Act,  1894  provides  the  framework  for  facilitating  land \nacquisition  in  India.  It  enables  the  Government  to  acquire  private  lands  for  public \npurposes, and seeks to ensure that no person is deprived of land except as provided \nunder this act.   \n \n8.  Resettlement  and  Rehabilitation  Policy  of  Madhya  Pradesh,  2002.  The \nMadhya  Pradesh  Resettlement  Policy  of  2002  recognizes  all  affected  persons \nirrespective  of  titles.  The  policy  provides  for  project-assisted  resettlement  for  (i) \nresettlement and relocation, (ii) income restoration, (iii) special attention to vulnerable \ngroups, (iv) time-bound and fair compensation, and (v) rebuilding and/or restoration of \ncommunity resources or facilities. \n \n9.  ADB\u2019s policy on Involuntary Resettlement policy requires:  \n(i)  avoiding or minimizing adverse project impacts where possible;  \n(ii)  consulting  with  affected  persons  (AP)  in  project  planning  and \nimplementation,  including  disclosure  of  RP  and  project-related \ninformation;  \n(iii)  paying compensation for acquired assets at replacement value; \n(iv)  entitling APs to receive assistance to restore income and livelihood at \npre-project standard, and entitling all vulnerable APs to receive additional \nassistance to improve their income and livelihood;  \n ", "88  Appendix 15 \n \n(v)  providing  resettlement  assistance  to  APs,  including  non-titled  persons \n(informal dwellers or squatters and encroachers);  \n(vi)  integrating APs economically and socially into their host communities, if \nrelocated.  \n(vii)  Safeguarding and supporting APs\u2019 social and cultural institutions; and \nrestoring common properties and facilities;  \n(viii)  carrying  out  compensation  and  rehabilitation  programs  with  equal \nconsideration for women and men; and  \n(ix)  providing income restoration and rehabilitation programs. \n \n10.  The basic principles adopted for the project are: \n(i)  Avoid negative impacts of land acquisition and involuntary resettlement \non persons affected by the project to the extent possible. \n(ii)  Where  negative  impacts  cannot  be  avoided,  assist  APs,  particularly \nvulnerable groups, in improving or at least regaining their standard of \nliving and income.  \n(iii)  Disclose  all  information  related  to  resettlement  planning  and \nimplementation, and ensure APs\u2019 participation in them. \n(iv)  Provide compensation for acquired assets at replacement and/or market \nvalue in accordance with the RP and resettlement framework.  \n(v)  Provide resettlement assistance and income restoration to APs, including \nnon-titled persons. \n(vi)  Provide  for  APs  not  present  during  enumeration.  However,  anyone \nmoving into the project area after the cutoff date will not be entitled to \nassistance. \n(vii)  Provide  compensation  and  resettlement  assistance  before  taking \npossession of the acquired lands and properties. \n(viii)  Establish grievance redress mechanisms to ensure speedy resolution of \ndisputes. \n(ix)  Ensure  involvement  of  women  and  vulnerable  groups  in  all  activities \nrelated to resettlement planning, implementation, and monitoring. \n(x)  Ensure adequate budgetary support to cover implementation costs for \nRPs. \n(xi)  Conduct internal and external monitoring of the implementation of RPs. \n \n11.

Information  Dissemination,  Consultation,  Disclosure,  and  Grievance \nRedress \n \n12.  All stakeholders were consulted at different stages of project preparation, and \nissues related to local needs, problems and prospects of resettlement, compensation \noptions, etc., were discussed. The EA has disseminated information on the project \nthrough public consultation and provision of project information. Preliminary information \non the program was published in the Gazette. In addition, however, it has been agreed \nthat the plans prepared so far for the Tranche 1 and Tranche 2 (RP, resettlement \nframework, and IPDF) were disclosed in relevant offices where resettlement impacts are \nanticipated.  The  EAs  translated  the  documents  into  local  language  (Hindi).  The \ndocuments were disclosed to the APs, according to the ADB and procedures of India. A \ngrievance  redress  committee  (GRC)  will  be  formed  to  ensure  APs\u2019  grievances  are \naddressed  and  to  facilitate  timely  project  implementation.  The  GRC  will  have \nrepresentatives from APs, head of PMU, PMU resettlement specialist, field-level staff, \ndistrict  magistrate,  local  administration,  revenue  authority,  implementing  Non \nGovernment Organization, and local community. The GRC will meet once a month. The \nmain responsibilities of the GRC are to provide support to APs on problems arising from \nland/property  acquisition;  and  record,  categorize,  and  prioritize  AP  grievances,  and \nresolve them within 4 weeks. \n \nF.  Institutional Framework \n \n13.  The respective EAs will have operational responsibility for project management \nand implementation of their respective components. TRANSCO will be responsible for \ntransmission,  while  the  DISCOMs  will  be  responsible  for  distribution.  A  project \nmanagement unit (PMU) will be set up at each company, and will function separately for \ntheir respective implementation. PMU expertise includes (i) engineering planning and \ndesign;  (ii)  economic  and  financial  management;  (iii)  procurement  and  contracts \nmanagement;  and  (iv)  safeguards  management,  which  includes  social  and \nenvironmental  management.  The  proposed  PMUs  do  not  have  any  resettlement \nspecialists. However, resettlement specialists who are committed to serving throughout \nproject implementation will be added to the PMU. For subproject RPs, the PMU will have \noverall coordination, planning, implementation, and financing responsibilities \n14.  The main institutions include the government of Madhya Pradesh (Department of \nEnergy),  TRANSCO,  DISCOM-E,  GRC,  NGO,  external  monitoring  and  evaluation \nagency, and APs. \n \nG.  Resettlement Budget \n \n15.  The resettlement budget is prepared for the components of the Tranche 1 with \nspecific reference to TRANSCO. Based on the government\u2019s rules and regulations, \nrevenue  rates,  market  rates,  data  collected  during  the  consultation  and  review  of \nprevious experiences and best practices, the R&R budget has been worked out. The \nresettlement  and  RP  implementation  for  Tranche  1,  especially  for  the  TRANSCO \ncomponents, will cost Rs77 million ($6.1 million). This is a tentative budget that will be \nupdated as the project is developed and finalized.  \n ", "92  Appendix 15 \n \n \n \n \nH.  Implementation Schedule \n \n16.  According to the conditions in the technical construction works contracts, land \nfree from all encumbrances is to be made available to the contractors in phases for each \ncontract package. The time frame for implementation of the RP will be synchronized with \nproject  implementation  to  avoid  undermining  commencement  and  progress  of  civil \nworks. The RP is expected to be implemented continuously, and will be completed in a \nphased manner for over the project duration for each specific contract and tranches. \nHowever,  the  sequence  might  change  or  delays  might  occur  due  to  circumstances \nbeyond the control of the project.

Monitoring and Evaluation \n17.  The PMU will monitor closely RP implementation for the project through its field \nstaff,  and  will  be  oversee  all  activities  related  to  RP  implementation.  Monitoring \ncomponents  will  include  performance  monitoring,  impact  monitoring,  and  external \nevaluation. Two broad categories of indicators will be monitored during the project: (i) \ninput and output indicators, and (ii) outcome and impact indicators. The PMU, with the \nhelp of the implementing NGO, will carry out internal monitoring according to impact \nindicators related to the overall project objectives as stated in the R&R policy and in the \nentitlement matrix. An external monitoring consultant will be engaged to monitor and \nevaluate proactively the RP objectives. The external monitoring consultant will submit \nmonthly and quarterly monitoring reports. A final evaluation will determine if the R&R \nobjectives have been achieved according to the performance impact indicators.  \n "], "metadata": {"CreationDate": "D:20070309101556+08'00'", "_EmailSubject": "Comments Matrix, RRP and FFA", "Author": "", "Creator": "Acrobat PDFMaker 7.0.5 for Word", "_AuthorEmailDisplayName": "Paul White", "Producer": "Acrobat Elements 7.0.5 (Windows)", "_AuthorEmail": "paul.white@wedgewoodwhite.com", "ModDate": "D:20070403104928+08'00'", "_AdHocReviewCycleID": "1158358186", "Company": "Licenced User", "SourceModified": "D:20070308112611", "Title": "Madhya Pradesh Power Sector Investment Program", "Keywords": "indian sustainable economic growth, indian governance projects, indian private sector development, indian energy projects, energy sector development projects, sustainable economic growth, 32298"}, "author_page": " \n  MIS  \u2013  Management Information Systems \n  MYT  \u2013  Multi Year Tariff \n  NEP  \u2013  National Electricity Policy \n  O&M  \u2013  operation and maintenance \n  OCR  \u2013  ordinary capital resources \n  PFR  \u2013  periodic financing request \n  PMU  \u2013  Project Management Unit \n  PPA  \u2013  power purchase agreement \n  PPP  \u2013  Private Public Partnership \n  RF  \u2013  Resettlement Framework \n  RP  \u2013  Resettlement Plan \n  SCADA  \u2013  Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition \n  TRADECO  \u2013  Madhya Pradesh Power Trading Company Limited \n  TRANSCO  \u2013  Madhya Pradesh Power Transmission Company Limited \n  WACC  \u2013  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n \nWEIGHTS AND MEASURES \n \nGWh  \u2013  gigawatt-hour (1,000 megawatt-hours) \nha (hectare)  \u2013  Unit of area \nkm (kilometer)  \u2013  1,000 meters \nkV   \u2013  kilovolt (1,000 volts) \nkW   \u2013  kilowatt (1,000 watts) \nkWh   \u2013  kilowatt-hour  \nMVA   \u2013  megavolt-ampere(1,000,000 volt-amperes) \nMW   \u2013  megawatt (1,000 kilowatts) \nMWh   \u2013  megawatt-hour  \nVA   \u2013  Volt-ampere  \n \n \nNOTES \n \n(i)  The fiscal year (FY) of India and its agencies runs from 1 April to 31 March of the \nfollowing year.
