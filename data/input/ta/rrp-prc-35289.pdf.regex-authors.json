The Plain is one of \nthe most important grain production areas in the PRC. Supporting rich \nbiological  diversity,  which  includes  23  species  listed  in  the  World \nConservation Union as globally threatened, the wetlands in the Sanjiang \nPlain are some of the most species-rich and endemic-rich ecosystems in \nAsia. However, the wetlands and forestlands have shrunk to one fifth of \ntheir  original  size  in  the  last  five  decades  because  of  increasing \npopulation and  grain  production,  and  flora  and  fauna  in the  wetland \nnature reserves (NRs) are threatened by farmland encroachment and \nwater  resource  exploitation.  To  protect  these  ecosystems  while \nsupporting the sustainable development of the area, the Project adopts a \nholistic model framework of watershed management by (i) rehabilitating \nand  protecting  degraded  forests  in  the  upper  watershed  areas,  (ii) \nrestoring and protecting wetlands NRs in the downstream areas, (iii) \nproviding  alternative  livelihood  to  farmers,  and  (iv)  strengthening  the \ncapacities of local agencies in charge of watershed wetland and NRs \nmanagement.  By  developing  and  pilot-testing  a  model  framework  to \nprotect wetland biodiversity while promoting the sustainable development \nof the areas, the Project will be instrumental in establishing a wetland \nprotection  program  in  the  PRC  that  protects  wildlife  biodiversity \neffectively  and  generates  employment  and  income  in  a  sustainable \nmanner. \n  \nRationale    In the PRC, the Sanjiang Plain wetlands are one of the richest areas with \n  globally significant flora and fauna, which are mostly concentrated in \nNRs.  However,  over  time,  they  have  lost  their  self-cleaning  and \ngeneration  capacity  with  a  resultant  decline  in  plant  and  animal \nbiodiversity of global significance. Further, the wetlands' biodiversity is \nunder  constant  threat  by  local  communities  exploiting  biological \nresources for their livelihood through unsustainable farming practices at \nNRs,  and  the  limited  management  capacity  of  NR  staff.  Recent \ngovernment  policies  and  plans  are  aimed  at  halting  and  reversing \nenvironmental  degradation  in  the  area.  However,  the  policies  need \nimprovement to achieve a \u201cmodel\u201d for sustainable management of the \nwetland  ecosystem  as  part  of  an  integrated  river-basin  management \npolicy. Heilongjiang is designated as one of the three environmental \nprovinces in the PRC, and the provincial government (HPG) is looking for \ndevelopment  opportunities  that  integrate  watershed  and  wetland \n ", "iv   \nmanagement in a sustainable way and that can be replicated throughout \nthe Sanjiang wetland NRs and other areas with similar environmental \nconditions.  The  proposed  Project  will  adopt  integrated  watershed \nmanagement in the Sanjiang Plain for wetland and forest conservation, \nbased on their potential to support ecologically sustainable economic \ndevelopment. It will provide a model framework that can be expanded for \ncomprehensive, longer-term management of wetlands and biodiversity \non a large river-basin scale. \n \nObjectives     The overall goal of the Project is sustainable management of natural \n  resources  to  protect  globally  significant  biodiversity  and  to  promote \neconomic development. The immediate objective is to protect the natural \nresources  of  the  Sanjiang  Plain  wetlands  and  their  watersheds \n(biodiversity, water, forests) from continued threats, and promote their \nsustainable use through the integrated conservation and development of \nselected wetlands and forest areas of the Plain and improve the well- \nbeing  of  local  communities.  The  project  scope  includes  watershed \nmanagement,  wetland  nature  reserve  management,  alternative \nlivelihood, and education and capacity building. The project management \ncomponent  will  carry  out  overall  implementation,  administration,  and \nmonitoring. The world will benefit from the enhanced conservation of \nglobally  significant  biodiversity  through  the  Project.  The  project  area \ncovers 18 counties situated in the Sanjiang Plain, in the northeast of \nHeilongjiang Province. \n \nCost Estimates    The Project will cost about $55.55 million equivalent, $9.41 million of this \n  in foreign exchange and $46.14 million equivalent in local currency.  \n \n    ($ million equivalent) \nFinancing Plan      Foreign  Local  Total   \n  Source of Financing   Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank   1.56  13.44  15.00  27 \nGlobal Environment Facility   5.67  6.47  12.14  22 \nHeilongjiang Provincial  2.18  22.19  24.37  44 \nGovernment         \nCounty Governments     0.00  4.04  4.04  7 \nTotal  9.41  46.14  55.55  100 \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimates \n     \nLoan Amount    A loan to the PRC in the amount of $15.00 million from the ordinary \nand Terms  capital resources of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will be provided \nunder  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending \nfacility.

The PMO will be guided by a project \n  steering committee, and assisted by a team of international and domestic \n  consultants under a project director. A total of 19 project implementation \n  units  (PIUs)  will  be  established,  one  in  each  of  13  county  forestry \nbureaus and 6 NRs.  \n \nProcurement    Goods and services to be financed by the ADB loan and the GEF grant \nwill be procured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. \nEquipment  or  materials  for  each  contract  valued  at  $1,000,000 \nequivalent or less will be procured through international shopping. Minor \nitems costing less than $100,000 equivalent will be procured by direct \npurchase. Civil works contracts will be relatively small\u2014relating to site \npreparation, weeding or planting\u2014and may be carried out through force \naccount. \n \nConsulting    Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nServices  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for selecting and engaging domestic consultants. To \nprovide  implementation  support  to  the  PMO,  international  consulting \nfirms in association with domestic firms will be selected using ADB\u2019s \nquality- and-cost-based selection method. The total consultant input for \nthe Project is estimated at 640 person-months (112 international and 528 \ndomestic)  of  technical  assistance.  Consultants  are  required  in  the \nmanagement of water resources, wetland biodiversity, and NRs; eco-\ntourism; and conservation education and awareness subcomponents. \nThe Project will also recruit qualified academic/research institutes for \nseveral  studies,  surveys,  and  long-term  training  programs,  including \nthose in water resources. \n \nProject Benefits    The potential global environmental benefits will be (i) increases in areas \nand  of breeding and foraging habitats for waterfowl and other wildlife, and the \nBeneficiaries  resultant  increases  in  populations  of  globally  threatened  species; \n  (ii) improved  water  resources  management  locally  and  in  watersheds \nleading  to  improved  wetlands  habitat  quality  and  increasing  wildlife \nnumbers; and (iii) reduced threats to globally threatened wildlife through \nincreased public and private awareness of the importance of wetlands for \nenvironmental conservation. The Project will result in positive global, \nnational,  and  local  environmental  impacts.  It  is  estimated  that  about \n46,000  forestry  workers  will  have  working  opportunities  during  the \nimplementation period. In addition, using nontimber forest products and ", "vi   \nadopting agroforestry intercropping as forest investments will enhance \nemployers\u2019 benefits for forest workers. The overall financial internal rate \nof  return  of  these  forest  developments  is  14.9%,  greater  than  the \nestimated weighted average cost of capital of 6.1%. The high financial \nreturn is due to low capital costs required in treating existing forests. The \noverall  economic  internal  rate  of  return  on  national  environmental \nbenefits is 24.8% outweighing the social cost of capital of 12%. \n  \nRisks and    The  removal  of  threats  to  wetland  biodiversity  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain \nAssumptions  requires  the  following:  (i) cooperation  among  resource  authorities  in \nintegrating watershed management with development and conservation \nplanning,  (ii)  improved  NR  management  through  better-trained \npersonnel, (iii) mutually beneficial relationships between protected areas \nand surrounding communities, and (iv) sustainable financial support to \nNR  management.  The  project  design  recommends  measures  to \nminimize the risks of failure. \n         ", " ", " ", "I.  THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan to the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) for the Sanjiang Plain Wetlands Protection Project, \nand (ii) proposed administration of a grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for the \nSanjiang Plain Wetlands Protection Project. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES  \n2.  The Project was prepared under Asian Development Bank (ADB) technical assistance \n1\n(TA) and a project development facility block grant of $330,000 from GEF.  The design of the \nproposed  investment  Project  is  based  on  integrated  water  resource  management  for  the \nprotection of wetland nature reserves (NRs), and thus the conservation of globally significant \nbiodiversity. After the Project was included in the GEF Council\u2019s Work Program in July 2004, an \nADB Appraisal Mission visited the PRC to refine the Project design and discuss with the \nGovernment the project objectives, scope, implementation arrangements, costs, financing plan, \nand components. This report is based on the findings of the Mission in the field and wide-\nranging consultations with stakeholders. The project framework is in Appendix 1. \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis  \n3.  Agricultural and food security policies in the PRC in the second half of the 20th century \nincluded a massive effort to expand grain production into the last areas of uncultivated fertile \n2\nsoils. The Sanjiang Plain,  a vast complex of marshes, meadows, and forests along the Russian \nborder  in  the  northeast  of  Heilongjiang  Province,  was  a  major  area  of  focus.  Extensive \n3\ndevelopment over five decades has shrunk the forestlands and wetlands  to a fifth of their \noriginal  size  and  thus  brought  about  various  climatic  changes  (dry  weather,  drought,  and \nfrequent floods). \n4.  Deforestation and cultivation of hillsides in the Sanjiang Plain have caused deterioration \nof the wetlands due to soil erosion and diminished the water-retention capacity of uplands. \n4\nForest workers lost income from timber production and often fell into poverty.  A potentially self-\nsustaining sector is not realizing their growth and quality potential. Consequently, potential \nbenefits of the upland forests to the hydrological cycle in the watersheds are undermined. As \nthe Plain has become more densely settled and reclaimed as farmland, the water-holding \ncapacity of the wetlands has diminished even as flooding has become more frequent and \nintense. To reduce economic damage to farmland and protect the people from destructive \nflooding, the Government has built flood control dikes. Wetland drainage and dike construction \non river floodplains have helped increase the cultivated land base, but have also damaged the \nnatural flood-retention capacity of wetlands that support globally significant fauna and flora, \n                                                 \n1\n  ADB. 2002. Technical Assistance to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Sanjiang Plain Wetlands Protection \nProject. Manila. The project concept entered the GEF financing pipeline in December 1999. \n2\n  Sanjiang means \u201cthree rivers\u201d\u2014the Heilong, Wusuli, and Songhua rivers. The Songhua River runs through the \nSanjiang Plain, and the Heilong and Wusuli rivers run along the border between the PRC and Russia. The \nSanjiang Plain (with about 8 million people living on 108,900 square kilometers (km2) of land, or slightly bigger than \nthe Republic of Korea) accounts for 20% of Heilongjiang Province (both in area and population) and lies at the \nconfluence of the three rivers. Before the agricultural development programs started in the 1950s, almost 50% of \nthe Plain used to be wetlands. \n3\n  \u201cWetland\u201d is a general term for marshes, swamps, wet meadows, shallow lakes, and streamside areas. Boundaries \nof wetlands are transitional and are shaped by precipitation, evaporation, watershed hydrology, and wetland \nvegetation. \n4\n  Heilongjiang has a poverty incidence of 9.7%\u201310.3% in the countryside, using official rural poverty indices at the \nnational level, and a per capita net annual income for poor households of CNY1,000. About 10% of households in \nState forest farms are poor. \n ", "2   \ndehydrating  those  wetlands  and  threatening  their  biodiversity.  As  the  population  grows, \ndevelopment accelerates, and the floodplains are more densely settled, the economic cost of \nflood  damage  will  also  increase.  The  Government  has  therefore  integrated  nonstructural \nmeasures such as flood forecasting and development of decision support systems to better \n5\nmanage  flood  emergencies.  But  these  measures  cannot  fully  reflect  holistic  watershed \nmanagement  approach  as  part  of  an  integrated  floodplains  and  wetland  ecosystem \n6\nmanagement.  A  new  policy  emphasizes  the  need  to  move  toward  natural  resource \nmanagement as a long-term, holistic way of floodplain management, which includes restoring \nfarmland to wetlands and forest. The sector is challenged to increase the forest cover, to sustain \nagricultural production, as well as to ensure the livelihood of farm and forest workers. \n5.  The Sanjiang Plain, as one of the PRC\u2019s richest in globally significant flora and fauna, \n7\nsupports about 37 ecosystems, 1,000 species of plants, and 528 species of vertebrate fauna  \nincluding 23 of the globally threatened species on the World Conservation Union Red List. Ten \nof the globally threatened species are waterfowl such as cranes, storks, and swan geese, which \nrequire  extensive,  undisturbed  wetlands  during  their  migration  and  breeding  seasons.  The \nSanjiang Plain wetlands are an important nesting and stopover location at the northern end of \nthe East Asian\u2013Australian flyway for migratory waterfowl, most notably the white-naped and red-\ncrowned cranes. The wetlands are also ranked as globally important in the Directory of Asian \nWetlands. The transformation of the Sanjiang Plain into a major grain production field over the \nlast  five  decades  has  therefore  been  achieved  at  considerable  loss  of  plant  and  animal \nbiodiversity, and overall cost to the environment. As the altered water cycle in the wetlands \nreduced their habitat size and self-cleaning capacity, plant and animal biodiversity of global \nsignificance has declined. The northeast tiger, red deer, bear, and other large wildlife have been \nkilled  off,  and  formerly  abundant  ducks,  geese,  cranes,  and  other  waterfowl  have  nearly \ndisappeared. Less than one tenth of the original populations of cranes now nest in the Sanjiang \nPlain. For these wetland-dependent wildlife species to survive, the continuing trend toward the \nreduction and degradation of the Sanjiang Plain wetlands must be reversed. \n8\n6.  The Government has adopted several important national policies and legal measures  to \nguide and direct habitat restoration and biodiversity conservation. The Wild Animal Protection \nLaw of 1988 has reduced the overexploitation of wildlife from hunting and egg collecting. In \n1993 the PRC ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity, which resulted from the Rio de \nJaneiro Conference on United Nations Environment and Development, and in 1994 it issued the \nBiodiversity Conservation Action Plan. The Heilongjiang provincial government (HPG) issued in \n                                                 \n5\n From 1999 to 2002, the Government invested CNY178.6 billion ($22.3 billion) in building infrastructure for hydraulic \nprojects, almost 2.5 times more than in the previous five decades. About 10% of such investments went to \nnonstructural measures; particularly flood detention basins and forecasting and modeling systems. The Australian \nAssistance for International Development is funding the Yangtze River Flood Control and Management Project \n($12 million), which will improve flood forecasting, flood warning, and the operation of 24 flood detention basins (up \nto 300 km2 in the area) along the middle reaches of the Yangtze. The Canadian International Development Agency \nhas recently completed a major hydraulic modeling study to improve flood forecasting for Donting Lake, in the \nmiddle reaches of the Yangtze River. ADB\u2019s Songhua and Yellow River flood management projects also adopted \nnonstructural measures\u2014flood forecasting and modeling. \n6\n The policy initiatives, by former Premier Zhu, are written in 32 words in Chinese, but no other formal documentation \nis available. The policy calls for the following: enclosing mountains to plant trees, transforming arable land back \ninto forests, demolishing polder fields to release floods, transforming farmland back into lakes, supplying labor as \ncontribution, relocating people to build townships, reinforcing stem river levees, and dredging river channels and \nlakes. Under the initiatives, the PRC is renewing flood control plans for all major river basins.  \n7\n A detailed review and analysis is included in Supplementary Appendix A: Profile of Wetlands Biodiversity in the \nSanjiang Plain. \n8\n A detailed review and analysis is in Supplementary Appendix B: Institutional, Legal, and Policy Analysis. \n ", "  3\n9\n1996 the Regulation of Nature Reserves, establishing priority wetland NRs,  and in 1998 the \nDecision on Wetland Conservation (Document of Heilongjiang Party Committee, No. 21, 1998), \nsuspending  further  conversion  of  wetlands  to  farmland.  In  2002,  the  National  Wetland \nConservation Action Plan, outlining priority actions to guide conservation, use, management, \nand institutional frameworks, was approved. The plan was reinforced a year later with the \nissuance of one of the PRC\u2019s first wetland regulations (Regulations on Wetland Conservation of \nHeilongjiang  Province,  HPG,  2003).  The  new  regulations  recognize  the  multiple  values  of \nwetlands, the necessity of conserving and managing them through the establishment of NRs, \nand the reality that wetlands and their wildlife remain threatened by agricultural expansion and \nexploitation of water and land resources. Despite the impressive legal steps, however, wetland \nrestoration and protection are still new concepts in the PRC. Wetland restoration programs have \nbeen  planned,  but  sound  wetland  management  expertise  and  scientific  knowledge,  not  to \nmention familiarity with healthy water resource management, are scarce. \n7.  The protected wetland area in the Sanjiang Plain now includes 28 NRs, which cover \n10,278 square kilometers (km2), or 9.4% of the Plain. Three of the NRs have been listed by the \n10\nRamsar  Convention  Bureau  as  wetlands  of  international  importance.  The  NRs  were \nestablished to protect the best remaining wetland habitats and their biodiversity, including most \nof the known sites for waterfowl nesting and migration. Nevertheless, wetland biodiversity is still \nthreatened  by  local  communities  exploiting  biological  resources  for  income,  inappropriate \nfarming practices in NRs, commercial tourism, and the limited management capacity of NR staff. \nWetland protection policies and laws should be further strengthened and supplemented with \noperational  tools  and  enforcement  measures.  Moreover,  the  low  community  awareness  of \nwetland  values  still  presents  a  serious  challenge,  preventing  the  NRs  from  attaining  their \nobjectives of habitat conservation and environmental protection through laws. \n8.  Different economic activities and wetland-dependent wildlife species vie for land and \nwater resources in the Sanjiang Plain. Economic decisions on wetland use are fragmented \namong  various  sectoral  agencies of  the  HPG,  such  as the  Agriculture  Department,  Water \nResources Department, Forest Department, Environmental Protection Bureau, State farms, and \nState forest farms. The 2003 Heilongjiang Wetland Regulations, however, gave official authority \nand responsibility for wetland management to the Heilongjiang Provincial Forest Department \n(HPFD).  An  integrated  water  resource  plan  for  wetland  management  and  biodiversity \nconservation,  with  NRs  playing  a  key  role,  is  needed.  The  various  institutions  must  also \ncoordinate among themselves in water and land resource sharing, as well as in information \ngathering and planning. Such coordination mechanisms have yet to be established, and roles \nand responsibilities still have to be defined clearly. With funding from the National Development \nand Reform Committee (NDRC), HPFD is about to launch a project that will restore 1,500 km2 of \nfarmland to wetlands and replant 685 km2 yearly from 2006 to 2010. HPG realizes that it must \nimprove its wetlands management approach, knowledge, and capacity to tackle this challenging \ntask. It has therefore sought ADB\u2019s assistance in developing a model approach that could be \n                                                 \n9\n  Nature reserves (NRs) are specially designated areas protected by PRC laws (National Regulation of Nature \nReserves, effective 1 December 1994) to conserve wetland habitats. Current regulations based on these laws \ndirect NR establishment and operation at all levels. Article 43 of the National Regulation, however, requires \nadministrative levels below the State to use these regulations as a blueprint in developing and implementing their \nown regulations. \n10\n The Convention on Wetlands, signed in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971, is an intergovernmental treaty that provides the \nframework for national action and international cooperation for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their \nresources. There are now 138 Contracting Parties to the Convention and 1,367 wetland sites, totaling 1.2 million \nkm2, designated for inclusion in the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance. The PRC ratified the \nRamsar Convention on 31 July 1992. The Ramsar sites in the Sanjiang Plain\u2014Honghe NR, Sanjiang NR, and \nXingkaihu NR, which is one of the project sites\u2014 (i) support 23 globally threatened species and 16 endemic \nspecies, and (ii) represent 16% of the total area of the Ramsar sites in the PRC.  \n ", "4   \nreplicated effectively on a wider scale and in strengthening HPG\u2019s capability to manage wetland \nbiodiversity.   \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n  1.  Threats and Constraints \n9.  Globally significant endangered species in the Sanjiang Plain rely on wetland habitats, \nand  wetlands  must  have  enough  water  to  maintain  their  saturated  soils  (including  peat), \ndistinctive vegetation, and productivity. Agricultural development has dramatically altered the \nhydrology of the watersheds in the Plain, desiccating many of the remaining wetlands, even \nwithin NRs. Also, the construction of flood control dikes to protect farmlands, the deforestation in \nthe middle and upper watersheds, and poor conservation practices on sloping agricultural lands \nhave all tended to reduce water retention in entire watersheds in the Plain; accelerating runoff, \nincreasing evaporation, or through soil erosion and sedimentation. These changes in watershed \nnot only worsen flooding but also prolong droughts at critical times of the year. As farming \nexpands and HPG faces a future of water scarcity, it becomes more difficult to maintain or \nincrease the forest and wetland areas, and to provide the wetlands with the needed water \nsupplies.  The  proposed  Project  aims  to  remove  the  barriers  to  balanced  environmental \nprotection, and to develop sustainable and replicable models to be applied elsewhere in the \nSanjiang  Plain  and  other  provinces.  The  key  barriers  (Appendix  2)  that  restrict  wetlands \nprotection and biodiversity conservation in the Sanjiang Plain are as follows. \n10.  Unsound  Local  Planning  Water  Resource  Allocation. Agricultural, industrial, and \ndomestic  water  uses  draw  on  water  supplies  that  are  also  needed  to  sustain  wetlands. \nAgriculture accounts for 70% of water use in Heilongjiang Province. Frequent droughts indicate \nserious problems of groundwater overdraft in the Sanjiang Plain. According to the Five-Year \nComprehensive Water Plans for the Province, the \u201cecological water supply\u201d is a marginal 3.6% \nof the total requirements. This is a gross underestimate that does not adequately cover the \nwater requirements of the Sanjiang Plain wetlands. Water consumption for agriculture in the \nProvince is expected to increase as the irrigated area expands from 9,530 km2 to 14,130 km2 by \n2010. Any further expansion of irrigation diversions or groundwater overpumping would also \nreduce the available water for wetlands, besides lowering the groundwater table. Although \nHeilongjiang Province has formally halted further wetland drainage, agricultural interests in the \n  11\nSanjiang Plain are still active in wetland drainage projects near NRs .  The great need for \narable land is unavoidable as the population grows. To protect wetland NRs, water resource \nallocation at the local level must be optimized.  \n11.  Poor  Understanding  of  Nonstructural  Flood  Mitigation  and  Floodplain \nManagement. Flood control and management have become a high-priority issue for HPG, \nespecially  after  the  devastating  floods  of  1998.  Flood  control  measures  are  still  mainly \nstructural\u2014dikes, pumping schemes, and flood storage reservoirs, which often encroach on \nwetlands  or  obstruct  water  supply  to  wetland  NRs.  Wetland  conservation  has  not  been  a \nsignificant consideration in flood control in the comprehensive water resource plans prepared \nevery 5 years. However, flood control agencies of the Government now realize that allowing the \nnatural flow of floodwater can be beneficial for wetlands conservation. An assessment must be \nmade to (i) strike a suitable balance between flood protection and wetland conservation; (ii) \nanalyze changes in precipitation in the catchment basin and the future seasonal runoff behavior \nof the main watercourses as part of forecasting; (iii) determine the factors for the efficient \nimplementation of integrated floodplain management in watersheds; and (iv) develop the most \nappropriate management model, which can be adapted to suit different watershed conditions. \n                                                 \n11\n  NRs are legally protected by land use zoning. Thus, threats to NRs from expanding agricultural land are not due to \nthe land use conversion but due to a lowering groundwater table, which further affects the size of wetlands in \nNRs.   \n ", "  5\n12.  Lack  of  Alternative  Livelihood  Enterprises,  Leading  to  Exploitation  of  Nature \nReserve Resources. The prospect of a net annual income of $210 to $256 per hectare from \ndryland grain production (wheat-soy-corn) strongly motivates farmers to expand the farmland in \nany way possible, including draining wetlands. Pesticide and fertilizer pollution, burning, grazing, \nand other agricultural practices within or near NRs adversely affect ecology. Rural residents \nexploit  fish,  wildlife  (e.g.,  duck  eggs),  and  other  \u201ccommon  property\u201d  wetland  resources  to \nsupplement  their  diet  and  income.  Alternative  livelihood  enterprises  must  be  provided  to \ndiscourage such harmful natural resource exploitation in wetlands. \n13.  Weak Interagency Coordination for Integrated Watershed Management. Irrigation \nand drainage, flood control, agricultural development, and wetland protection responsibilities in \nthe Sanjiang Plain are divided among agencies with little basis or incentive for coordination. \nAlthough  HPFD  now  has  formal  authority  for  wetland  protection,  State  farms  and  other \nprovincial agencies that work in drainage and irrigation projects allocate water resources and \nmake  watershed  forest  management  decisions  independently  of  one  another.  Interagency \ncoordination is urgently needed for integrated watershed management.  \n14.  Weak Technical Capacity in NR Management. Personnel responsible for managing \nwetland  NRs  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain  rarely  have  the  necessary  training  for  duties  such  as \nenforcement, wildlife surveys, natural resource monitoring, and public outreach. Many staff \nmembers were recently reassigned to NRs from agricultural positions in State farms, reed \nproduction companies, or similar productive enterprises. Moreover, NR management is a new \nresponsibility of HPFD, which has no training program for its wetland NR staff members, who \nare seriously underprepared for their duties. Thus, a training program for wetland NR staff and \nmanagers is urgently needed.  \n15.  Lack  of  a  Replicable  Financing  Model  and  Shortage  of  Available  Capital  to \nReplace  Arable  Farmland.  Wetland  restoration  will  require  converting  farmland  back  to \nwetlands within certain NRs. Farmers on State farms and villagers with agricultural leases within \nthe NRs must be compensated for the income lost and provided with replacement land as \nrequired. On the other hand, the financial burden on the Government for replacing lost farmland \nshould be manageable. To address the financial constraints, an alternative model approach that \nprovides opportunities for revenue generation (sustainable livelihood) and positive returns on \ninvestment, instead of sunk compensation costs, is needed.  \n16.  Low  Public  Awareness  of  Wetland  Values  and  Biodiversity  Conservation. \nBiodiversity conservation and wetland protection are hampered by the lack of education and \ntraining and low awareness of the environmental values of wetlands among the people in \nvillages  surrounding  the  NRs.  Simply  restoring  farmland  to  wetlands  would  result  in  only \ntemporary protection, which would be unsustainable over the longer term. Thus, an appropriate \ncommunity awareness campaign is required.  \n17.  Incorrect Interpretation of Legislation on Experimental Zones. NR establishment \nand management are governed primarily by regulations adopted by the State Council in 1994. \nAs  defined  by  the  Environment  and  Natural  Resource  Protection  Legal  Handbook  (1998), \nprotected wetland NRs comprise three types of zones: core, buffer, and experimental. Human \nactivities in core and buffer zones are clearly prohibited, but activities in the experimental zone \n(the outer portion of the NR surrounding the buffer zone) are permitted subject to interpretation \nof local regulations. Past activities in the experimental zone have disturbed wildlife nesting and \nbreeding,  and  further  unauthorized  use  could  threaten  wetland  biodiversity  conservation \nbecause of habitat loss and degradation. A clearer interpretation of NR legislation and more \neffective enforcement are required.   \n  2.  Government Policies and Plans \n18.  The Government\u2019s development program was set out by the 16th Party Congress in \n ", "6   \n2002, the 10th National People\u2019s Congress of 2003, and the Tenth Five-Year Plan (2000\u20132005). \nThe major focus of national economic policy has gradually shifted in the last few years from \nhard economic indicator targets toward quality of growth and sustainable development. Besides \nits continued strong emphasis on market-related reforms and nonstate sector development, the \nGovernment is increasingly emphasizing the protection of the environment, sustained natural \nresource management, and a better quality of life. National economic priorities include programs \nto reduce poverty in rural areas, increase rural incomes, improve income distribution, and \nenable the private sector to create employment. Farmers may now leave their farming business \nby selling land-use rights or take advantage of government land conversion programs. One \nsuch program is the Farm-to-Forest Program of NDRC, which has converted vast areas of \nmarginal  farmland  to  forestland  in  upper  watersheds  of  northern  PRC.  The  conversion  of \nfarmland to wetlands in Heilongjiang, begun in 2003, is in line with this program. \n19.  Agricultural Policy and Wetlands. The PRC\u2019s Agenda 21 White Paper on China\u2019s \nPopulation, Environment and Development in the 21st Century requires, among others, holistic \ntreatment of watersheds as fundamental to wetland management. The agriculture sector has \nincreasingly emphasized environmental protection and sustainable farming since the Agenda 21 \nAgriculture Action Plan of 1998. This document mentions the need for biodiversity conservation \nand wise use of farmland, grassland, and ecosystems, as well as monitoring and control of \nagricultural pollution. It sets the goal of \u201cestablishing 160 conservation zones to cover a total \narea of 25 million hectares\u201d (ha) to strengthen the conservation of wildlife, and will conduct \n12\nmonitoring and research in agricultural/pasture/fishery areas.   \n20.  Forest Policy and Watersheds. The Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP) for \n1998\u20132010 drastically restricts the harvesting of natural forests nationwide, allowing HPG to \nstrengthen its commercial forests. The Sanjiang Plain has about 1.1 million ha of forests: over \n0.7 million ha of natural forests and almost 0.4 million ha of commercial forest plantations. \nHeilongjiang Province has the country\u2019s largest standing timber reserves and timber production. \nHence, current national and provincial policy is to replant forests on a commercial basis on \nexcessively steep, erodible, or unproductive farmland, and compensate the farmers under the \nFarm-to-Forest Program. The availability of compensation funds limits State forest farms\u2019 ability \nto carry out this program only within their own forestlands, substantial portions of which are \ncurrently leased to forest workers for grain production as alternative income sources. \n21.  Biodiversity  Conservation.  PRC\u2019s  Biodiversity  Conservation  Action  Plan  (BCAP), \nissued on 13 June 1994, lists and describes priority biodiversity conservation projects. Project \n18\u2014Establishment of an Integrated Nature Reserve Network in the Sanjiang Plain, Heilongjiang \nProvince\u2014 has been achieved in part by the establishment of 28 national, provincial, and local \nNRs.  The  PRC  is  also  a  signatory  to  the  Convention  on  Wetlands  (Ramsar  Convention). \nComplementing  the  BCAP  is  the  National  Wetland  Conservation  Action  Plan  (NWCAP), \napproved in 2002, which is the key document guiding the conservation, use, and management \nof PRC wetlands. The NWCAP lists among \u201cimportant wetlands in China\u201d several that are part \nof the project area: the Sanjiang Plain in general, the Naoli-Qixing river basin, the lower reaches \nof the Muling River, Xingkai; and the Small Xingkai lakes. The NWCAP calls for an inventory \nand study of the wetlands, as well as \u201ccomprehensive management of wetland and hydrologic \nbasins\u201d  and,  particularly  in  Project  20,  \u201cwetland  conservation  and  sustainable  use  of  the \nSanjiang Plain.\u201d  \n  3.  ADB\u2019s Country Strategy \n22.  ADB\u2019s  country  strategy  and  program  (CSP  2004\u20132007)  for  the  PRC  places  strong \nemphasis on (i) promoting equitable and inclusive growth, especially in remote rural areas; (ii) \n                                                 \n12\n Agriculture Action Plan for China\u2019s Agenda 21, Section 7.53, 1998. \n ", "  7\nmaking the markets work better; (iii) improving the environment, including dealing with land and \nwater degradation issues; and (iv) promoting regional cooperation. CSP 2004\u20132007 thoroughly \nreflects the PRC\u2019s medium- and long-term strategy and is focused on the following sectors: (i) \nagricultural and rural development, including land degradation; (ii) transport and energy; and (iii) \nthe environment, including water and soil management. Conservation of soils, forests, and \nwetlands  and  abatement  of  water  pollution  are  recognized  as  critical  environmental \ninterventions with a positive impact on the poor. In this context, the proposed Project strongly \nsupports ADB\u2019s principal strategic concerns. The wetlands and forests of the Sanjiang Plain are \nmajor  environmental  assets.  Appropriate  conservation  of  wetlands  and  their  forested \nwatersheds  will  have  a  positive  effect  on  flood  management  and  overall  watershed \nmanagement in the river basins, while encouraging agricultural interests to use water more \nwisely. Project income-generating initiatives are aimed at remote forest farms and wetland \nareas, supporting ADB\u2019s focus on equitable and inclusive growth. \n  4.  The Global Environment Facility  \n23.  The Project addresses both the underlying and proximate causes of wetland habitat loss \nby creating a model framework to protect high-quality wetlands, and by building community \nrelations and NR management capacity to maintain the health of these wetlands. HPG actions \nand project initiatives strongly complement each other. HPG took concrete regulatory steps in \n2003 to clarify responsibility for wetland management and to emphasize its commitment to \nimproving the management of wetland NRs in the Sanjiang Plain. HPG will implement activities \nspecifically identified in the BCAP and NWCAP of the PRC. The Project addresses a national \npriority and therefore meets a GEF criterion. GEF supports only strategic operational program \n(OP) areas with global benefits. \n  5.  External Assistance to the Sector and Lessons Learned \n24.  Wetlands protection and biodiversity conservation are relatively new concepts in the \nPRC, as well as in HPG, and there has been very little external assistance directly for NRs and \nSanjiang  Plain  wetlands  protection  (Appendix  3).  (One  exception,  a  project  of  the  United \nNations Development Programme (UNDP)/GEF had Honghe and Sanjiang NRs in the Sanjiang \nPlain as two of four pilot study cases.) ADB and World Bank assistance in the natural resources \nand  environment  sectors  has  focused  on  improving  flood  management  and  increasing \nagricultural production. ADB\u2019s forest development projects in general provide lessons from \nvarious  countries,  indicating  (i)  community  participation  and  (ii)  partnership  between  forest \ndepartment and participants, as key factors in the success of plantations and reforestation. \nMore recently, ADB assistance to the PRC in the environment sector has focused on developing \nthe institutional framework for combatting land degradation in the western region. The $12 \nmillion UNDP/GEF project Wetland Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Use in China, \n2001\u20132006,  may  complement  the  proposed  Project.  However,  this  project  has  taken  an \nengineering approach to restoring the hydrologic regime at specific NRs, and its institutional \narrangements for NR management from the nation\u2019s capital have been complicated and difficult \nto implement at the local level. The proposed Project addresses these two weaknesses by (i) \ntreating wetland protection and water resource management holistically at the watershed scale, \nnot simply at the level of NR sites; and (ii) implementing and administering the Project at the \nprovincial level to improve coordination and minimize interagency conflicts. A new initiative of \nthe  United  Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP)/GEF,  the  Amur  River  Basin \nTransboundary  Cooperation  Project,  focusing  on  land-based  pollution  along  the  Amur  and \nHeilong  rivers  on  the  boundary  between  the  PRC,  Mongolia,  and  Russia,  falls  under  the \ninternational water issue dealt with in OP 9, Integrated Land and Water Multiple Focal Area. The \nUNEP/GEF initiative requires international cooperation for biodiversity conservation, while the \nproposed Project seeks to minimize the complexities of institutional coordination in wetland \nmanagement by working under one provincial government with a strong sense of ownership. \n ", "8   \nThe Project will exchange information and expertise with the ongoing UNDP/GEF project\u2014 \nPeatlands, Biodiversity and Climate Change\u2014which is experimenting with wetland restoration in \nthe Ruoergai marshes, and with the UNEP/GEF Siberian crane project. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT  \nA.  Objectives  \n25.  The overall goal of the Project is the sustainable management of natural resources to \nprotect globally significant biodiversity and to promote economic development. The immediate \nobjective is to protect the natural resources of the Sanjiang Plain wetlands and their watersheds \n(biodiversity, water, forests) from continued threats, and promote their sustainable use through \nthe integrated conservation and development of selected wetlands and forest areas of the \nSanjiang Plain and the improved well-being of local communities. The Project will give priority \nattention  to  the  protection  of  globally  significant  wetlands  in  contiguous  watersheds,  by \nexpanding the upstream forest areas while protecting downstream wetlands and NRs. The \nproject area covers 18 counties, situated in the Sanjiang Plain. These 18 counties are grouped \n13\ninto five contiguous watersheds. Six NRs  with the greatest concentration of biodiversity in the \nfive watersheds will be the focus of protection/restoration models. Xingkaihu NR is one of the \nsites listed by the Ramsar Convention, and the others are all national NRs. Thirteen out of 18 \ncounties have investment proposals of reforestation interventions in the Sanjiang watersheds \n(Map 2). \n26.  The  proposed  project  intervention  is  based  on  the  need  to  integrate  sustainable \nenvironmental management strategies with rural economic development. Rather than simply \naddress the sustainability of localized environmental issues in the six selected pilot NRs, the \nProject aims at developing a model framework that can be replicated to provide direct examples \nfor ongoing HPG wetland and forestland restoration programs. The project approach conforms \nto  ADB\u2019s  CSP  (2004\u20132006);  is  fully  compatible  with  the  objectives  of  GEF\u2019s  biodiversity \nconservation focal area; and is consistent with the following strategic priorities indicated in GEF \nBusiness Planning: Directions and Targets: Strategic Priority Biodiversity (BD)-1: Catalyzing \nSustainability of Protected Areas, BD-2: Mainstreaming Biodiversity in Production Landscapes \nand Sectors, and BD-4: Generation and Dissemination of Best Practices for Addressing Current \nand Emerging Biodiversity Issues. Appendix 4 summarizes the rationale for GEF involvement \nand  the  Project  contributions  to  national  sustainable  development  and  incremental  global \n 14\nbenefits.  \nB.  Components and Outputs \n27.  The four principal project components will address the main threats to globally significant \nbiodiversity  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain.  The  primary  global  benefit  will  be  the  increase  in  the \npopulation  of  globally  endangered  species  through  improved  wetland  habitat  and  wildlife \nmanagement at NRs. The country itself will benefit from strengthened forest development and \nsustainable environmental management. A fifth component, project management, covers project \n15\nimplementation and management support.   \n28.  Component 1: Watershed Management. This component will address the threat to \nwetlands from competition for water resources and altered water balance in the Sanjiang Plain. \nThe subcomponents are (i) forest Improvement in watersheds, to improve forest management, \n                                                 \n13\n Supplementary Appendix C discusses the site selection analysis and the selected six NRs, such as Anbanghe, \nDajihe, Naolihe, Qixinghe, Xingkaihu, and Zhenbaodao. \n14\n GEF Executive Summary is in Supplementary Appendix D. \n15\n  Supplementary Appendix E includes a summary table of the Project\u2019s physical components by location, and \ndescribes the project\u2019 components in greater detail.  \n ", "  9\nreduce surface runoff, and increase soil water retention and groundwater recharging; (ii) local \nNR water resource management, to restore natural water balance within wetland NRs; and \n(iii) water  resource  planning  in  watersheds,  to  enhance  watershed-level  water  resource \nmanagement. Activities include planting 11,900 ha of indigenous poplar and larch on denuded \nslopes or farmland, and improving an additional 43,700 ha of existing plantations; establishing \ninteragency  working  groups  among  stakeholders  at  the  local  level  for  water  resource \nmanagement in targeted NRs; and developing model watershed-level water allocation plans in \nand around watersheds, incorporating flood control impact and wetland protection aspects, and \ninstitutionalizing this process.  \n29.  Component 2: Wetland Nature Reserve Management. This component is designed to \naddress the threats from past wetland conversion and degradation of habitat, and to promote \nenhanced  biodiversity  protection  in  wetland  NRs.  The  subcomponents  are  (i)  conservation \nmanagement,  to  develop  monitoring  and  management  plans  and  methodologies;  (ii)  pilot \nwetland restoration, to provide models of well-designed and well-monitored wetland restoration \nin the six project NRs; (iii) wildlife species recovery, to promote repopulation of NR wetlands \nwith globally threatened wildlife species, especially high-profile migratory waterfowl (cranes, \nstorks, and swan geese); and (iv) reduction of resource exploitation, by establishing of reliable \ninformation baselines and a geographic information system (GIS); management planning; pilot \nrestoration of 3,433 ha of wetlands, including testing various restoration techniques (natural, \nsupported, and engineered recovery) as appropriate at different habitats/sites; building the \ncapacity  for  farmland-to-wetland  restoration;  developing  restoration  guidelines;  producing  a \nmanual on farmland-to-wetland restoration; and developing and implementing species recovery \nprograms.  The  model  wetland  restoration  approach  will  be  linked  to  alternative  livelihood \nschemes, to compensate for lost access to farmland and other resources. Seminars, workshops, \nand conferences will be held to share the learning experiences, to extract lessons, and to \nidentify core elements for successful replication and scaling up. \n30.  Component 3: Alternative Livelihood Programs. In this component, the Project will \ndevelop and implement programs for sustainable livelihood in villages affected by reverting \n16\nfarmland to legally designated forestlands or NR wetlands,  to ensure lasting benefits for both \nthe environment and the affected communities. The subcomponents are (i) agroforestry and \nnontimber  forest  product  (NTFPs)  interventions,  providing  investments  in  agroforestry \n(intercropping) and NTFPs to State forest farms affected by the reversion program, to increase \nincome-earning opportunities for workers whose farming activities may be curtailed; (ii) village \ndevelopment, providing compensation to villages affected by the reversion of farmland to NR \nwetlands, including support for eco-friendly livelihood enterprises, or village development based \non  resettlement  and  village  development  plans;  and  (iii)  sustainable  ecotourism,  including \nmaster planning for NRs, preparation of tourism guidelines, and implementation of pilot projects \n(e.g., construction of basic NR infrastructure such as signboards).  \n31.  Component 4: Education and Capacity Building. This component will address the \nroot  causes  of  overexploitation,  human  disturbances,  and  habitat  degradation  in  NRs  by \nincreasing the capacity of NR staff and building community knowledge about wetlands, wildlife, \nand nature conservation. Where possible and appropriate, there will be gender awareness and \nsensitivity  training  programs.  The  three  subcomponents  are  (i)  conservation  education,  for \nteachers  and  their  students  in  rural  schools  near  NRs;  (ii)  public  awareness,  to  improve \nunderstanding of the importance of conserving wetland resources among rural residents around \n                                                 \n16\n  Except for 43 households, there will be very little physical resettlement of people, but compensation will be given \nfor loss of access to farmland in the wetland NRs. Because the remaining land in villages will be reallocated, \nvillage collectives rather than individuals will be affected. Under the subcomponent intercropping and nontimber \nforest products, the farmland to be reverted to forestlands in State forest farms already belongs to those farms and \nso there will be no need to transfer landownership.  \n ", "10  \nNRs;  and  (iii)  wetland management  training,  primarily  to  give  NR  staff  practical  skills  and \nknowledge  to  better  manage  the  wetland  NRs.  The  Project  will  actively  involve \nacademic/scientific communities in building benefit monitoring and evaluation capacity. \n32.  Component 5: Project Management. The consulting services in this component will \nstrengthen the coordination of technical support and improve the capacity of the executing and \nimplementing  agencies  to  manage  and  supervise  project  activities.  Project  implementation \ncapability at the provincial, county, and NR levels will be strengthened through technical support \nand  training  for  finance  and  technical  personnel.  Environmental  monitoring  will  also  be \nstrengthened through (i) mitigations, specifically for forestry improvement components, as part \nof the integrated watershed management approach; (ii) further environmental assessment for \nthe  pilot  wetland,  agroforestry,  and  NTFP  components  and  village  development \nsubcomponents;  and  (iii) monitoring  and  review  activities  of  the  Heilongjiang  provincial \nenvironmental bureaus, as part of mitigation implementation and environmental assessment.  \nC.  Special Features \n33.  The Project will develop a model framework for dealing with root causes, and adopt a \nholistic approach for wider replication. The model framework will incorporate root problems of \ndifferent scales at both local and watershed levels by integrating the management of upper \nwatershed  forested  areas  and  low-lying  wetland  habitats,  and  will  lay  the  foundation  for \nwidening  the  scale  to  the  river-basin  level  in  later  stages.  To  protect  globally  important \nbiodiversity resources, the landscape must be protected so that globally threatened waterfowl \nand mammals have enough room for migration pathways, feeding grounds, and breeding sites. \nHowever, longer-term benefits depend, not only on the simple multiplication of activities but also \non the ability to scale up activities to cover larger areas. For these reasons, the scaling up of \n17\nproject interventions is an integral part of the exit strategy,  especially as HPG is expected to \nrestore 150,000 ha of farmland to wetlands by 2010 under the Master Plan for Heilongjiang \nProvince Wetland Restoration. Thus, the Project will build an exit strategy to strengthen these \nkey aspects of viability and sustainability, and formulate target indicators for monitoring the \nsuccess of its scaling-up efforts.  \n34.  Key elements of the exit strategy are (i) strengthening financial sustainability by (a) \nimproving  forest  management  to  increase  the  financial  returns  of  the  sector;  (b)  covering \nrecurrent costs of NR management through successive yearly increases in payments by county \nforest bureaus of CNY0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 ha/yr during implementation; and (c) financing village \ndevelopment  as  part  of  land  compensation  and  resettlement  costs  to  support  sustainable \nlivelihood; (ii) building community participation and awareness of the importance of biodiversity \nto broaden support; (iii) strengthening institutional sustainability through scaled-up interagency \ncoordination between local  and provincial water resource management agencies by (a) linking \nwater resource allocation planning by individual agencies and integrating this with development \nand  conservation  planning,  (b) sharing  information,  and  (c)  setting  up  working  groups  as \ncoordinating  committees;  and  (iv) institutionalizing  working  group  arrangements.  Resources \nhave been allocated for workshops and conferences to identify factors for successful scaling up, \nand for training relevant to the exit strategy.  \n35.  The Project\u2019s model approach will guide wetland restoration in more than 150,000 ha of \nNRs throughout the province. As 3,433 ha of farmland reverts to wetlands, village development \nplans (VDPs) will be attached to the restoration program to ensure that livelihood enterprises in \nvillages  affected  by  the  farmland-to-wetland  program  can  increase  alternative  income \nopportunities in a sustainable manner. Part of the land compensation will be targeted for village \n                                                 \n17\n The  exit  strategy  is  to  strengthen  these  key  aspects  of  sustainability  and  viability,  namely,  (i)  financing, \n(ii) institutional framework, (iii) capacity building, (iv) stakeholder participation, and (v) monitoring and evaluation. \nFurther details are in Supplementary Appendix F.  \n ", " 11\ndevelopment. Individuals who give up farmland in the NRs will receive replacement land in their \nvillage, provided by the village collective. Land compensation will be paid to the village collective, \nwhich  will  reallocate  land  use.  Depending  on  the  village,  about  30%  of  resettlement \ncompensation will go to alternative livelihood enterprises, particularly those that are conducive \nto wetland management. Livelihood activities will be approved only after all the affected villagers \nare  consulted  and  consensus  is  reached  on  the  VDPs.  The  VDPs  will  form  part  of  the \nresettlement plans, and will be guided by the environmental management plan (EMP) to ensure \nthat  activities  near  the  NRs  are  consistent  with  wetlands/biodiversity  protection.  For  the \nfarmland-to-forest restoration program, investments will be made in agroforestry and NTFPs, to \nensure that villagers losing farmland retain at least the same standard of living. \n36.  The elements of the project design will (i) ensure that the Project benefits the people, \n(ii) provide a model framework that can be replicated extensively, and (iii) reduce the financial \nburden of resettlement compensation on the Government from sunk cost into environmentally \nsustainable investment opportunities for the affected villages. \nD.  Cost Estimates  \n37.  The  Project  will  cost  about  $55.55  million  equivalent,  with  $9.41  million  in  foreign \nexchange and $46.14 million equivalent in local currency costs. Table 1 summarizes the cost \nestimates; details of the project costs and financing plan are in Appendix 5.  \nTable 1: Cost Estimates \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total  \nItem  Exchange  Currency  Cost \nA.

Financing Plan \n38.  It is proposed that ADB provide the PRC with a loan of $15.00 million (27% of the project \ncost) from its ordinary capital resources to finance the foreign exchange cost of $1.56 million \nand $13.44 million equivalent of the local currency cost (Table 2). The proposed financing plan \nis justified given the important pilot nature of the environmental protection strategy and goals. \nThe  loan  will  have  a  25-year  term,  including  a  grace  period  of  5  years,  an  interest  rate \ndetermined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, an annual commitment charge of 0.75%, and such other terms and conditions set forth \nin the draft loan and project agreements. The front-end fee of 1.0% will be waived if the loan is \napproved by ADB before July 2005. The Government has provided ADB with (i) the reasons for \nits decision to borrow under ADB's LIBOR-based lending facility on the basis of these terms and \n ", "12  \nconditions, and (ii) an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision and not \nmade in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. GEF will cofinance the Project \n18\nthrough a grant administered by ADB.  The GEF grant will be for $12.14 million equivalent \n(22% of the Project cost): $5.67 million in foreign exchange and $6.47 million equivalent in local \ncurrency. The Government will contribute $24.37 million equivalent (44% of project cost) to \nfinance interest during construction and commitment charges of $2.18 million in foreign currency \nand $22.19 million equivalent in local currency. Local currency costs will also be financed partly \nby  GEF  and  ADB.  The  remaining  $4.04  million  equivalent  in  local  currency  costs  will  be \nfinanced in kind by the participating beneficiaries and county governments as part of their equity \ncontribution for the income-generating activities.  \nTable 2: Financing Plan \n($ million) \n  Foreign  Local  Total   \nSource   Exchange  Currency  Cost  Percent \nAsian Development Bank   1.56  13.44  15.00  27  \nGlobal Environment Facility    5.67   6.47  12.14  22  \nHeilongjiang Provincial Government   2.18   22.19  24.37  44 \nCounty Governments   0.00   4.04  4.04   7 \n 9.41   46.14  55.55   100 \nTotal \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n39.  Executing Agency. HPG will be the Executing Agency for the Project, and will have \noverall responsibility for coordinating, supervising, and implementing all Project activities. \n40.  Project Steering Committee. The Project Steering Committee (PSC), which has been \nestablished, will oversee Project implementation and set general policies related to the Project. \nThe Steering Committee will also be responsible for Project coordination between the PMO and \nall concerned HPG authorities. The Steering Committee will be composed of representatives of \nthe  relevant  HPG  agencies,  and  will  meet  once    every  six  months,  or  more  frequently  if \nnecessary. \n41.  Project Management Office. A project management office (PMO) has been established \nwithin HPFD for the day-to-day implementation of the project, under the guidance of the PSC. \nComposed of professional and administrative staff assigned from government agencies for the \nProject, the PMO will have the capacity to carry out the project activities in coordination with \nHPG agencies. It will be headed by a full-time project director who will report to HPG through \nthe PSC. The principal functions and responsibilities of the PMO are (i) managing all Project \nactivities in coordination with HPG agencies and in accordance with the requirements and \nguidelines of the national government, HPG, ADB, and GEF; (ii) planning for, and monitoring \nand supervising of use of the project funds in coordination with HPFB, including from the State \nfarm bureaus, and (iii) administering, monitoring, reporting, and coordinating all Project activities. \nThe HPG Financial Bureau (HPFB) will be responsible for the administration and supervision of \ndisbursements of the proceeds or counterpart funds, from the loan, the GEF grant, the central \ngovernment, State farm bureaus and Heilongjiang country finance bureaus to the HPG agencies \nunder the Project. \n42.  Project Implementing Agencies and Implementation Units. Besides the PMO, 19 \nproject implementation units (PIUs) with adequate professional and technical staffing will carry \nout field operations and coordinate the flow of funds from county financial bureaus to the \n                                                 \n18\n  Cofinancing is subject to the final approval of the Project by the GEF. \n ", " 13\nbeneficiaries.  Thirteen  PIUs  will  be  housed  at  the  county  forestry  bureaus,  and  will  be \nresponsible for the day-to-day implementation of forest management, agroforestry, and NTFP \nactivities in the 13 project counties. The six other PIUs will be housed at six NRs where wetland \nNR management activities will be implemented, and will be responsible for carrying out those \nactivities. The PIUs will be staffed by adequate professional and technical personnel provided \nby either the county forestry bureaus or the NRs, depending on the type of PIU. The PIUs will \nprepare their annual operating plans detailing the physical and financial dimensions of their \nprogrammed activities. The PMO will consolidate the PIU annual plans into a project-level \nannual work plan and budget. \n43.  Coordination. PSC will be composed of representatives of the relevant HPG agencies. \nPSC will be responsible for supervision of PMO and for coordination of agencies involved in the \nProject. The PMO will report directly to the PSC, which will be composed of representatives of \nprovincial government agencies, thus ensuring coordination between project management and \nall concerned provincial authorities. The HPFD has responsibility for wetland management in \nthe province, as well as the forest management activities in state forest farms in the 13 project \ncounties. This will give the PMO staff clear lines of authority for project activities in both the \nupland and wetland project sites. Provincial-level coordination will also require close links with \nHPFB, which will be responsible for flow of funds from ADB (including GEF) and the national \nand provincial governments. The PSC will oversee project implementation and set general \nproject policies relevant to the project. A field office will be based in the Baoqing County PIU, \nnear the center of the Sanjiang Plain, to support field activities. Technical working groups, to be \nformed at each NR, will include county-level staff of the Forestry Department, Environmental \nProtection Bureau, Water Resource Bureau, and Tourism Bureau; representatives of State \nforestry farms, State farms, or villages involved; and local school teachers. Watershed-level \ninteragency  coordinating  body  will  be  established  at  the  provincial  level  to  coordinate  the \ncomponent, water resource planning in watersheds. The project implementation organization \nchart is in Appendix 6. \n44.  Beneficiary Participation. Since the lands for project components are still owned by the \nstate  farms,  village  collectives,  or  State  forest  farms,  engagement  and  joint  planning  and \ndevelopment are essential. The Project will support the involvement of local communities in \nproject design, implementation, and management through participation in preparing the (i) NR \nmaster plans, (ii) watershed management plans, (iii) VDPs and alternative livelihood programs, \n(iv) ecotourism plans, and (v) employment opportunities related to project implementation (e.g., \ntree plantation and treatment). To promote participation and strengthen a sense of ownership, \nimproved compensation and access to alternative livelihood development will be provided to \n19\naffected communities.   \n45.  Implementation Schedule. The Project will be implemented from July 2005 to June \n2010. Year 1 will involve management and implementation arrangements and other preparatory \ntasks. Year 5 will focus more on evaluation, monitoring, sustainability and exit strategy, and the \nhandover of responsibilities. The project implementation schedule is in Appendix 7. \n46.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement. The Project involves the conversion to wetlands \nof  3,433  ha  of  farmland\u20141,433  ha  in  five  NRs  and  2,000  ha  in  Naoli  NR\u2014allocated  for \nconversion in 2002, and the provision of supplementary alternative livelihood support. Since 260 \n20\nfarmers  from eight villages (in six NRs) will have to abandon farming in the NRs and future \nland use will be restricted, the farmers will have to be compensated for lost land use and \nnonmovable assets. A resettlement framework and resettlement plans (RPs) for Qixinghe and \n                                                 \n19\n  Supplementary Appendix G discusses the social assessment and public participation plan. \n20\n  Only 43 families will be physically relocated; the rest will require land compensation only. \n ", "14  \n21\nXingkaihu NRs have been prepared,  endorsed by HPFD and approved by ADB.  In the \nalternative  livelihood  component,  RPs  will  be  prepared  for  each  of  the  six  NRs,  including \nupdates of the RPs for Qixinghe and Xingkaihu NRs. Each affected village (or State farm) will \nprepare a VDP in consultation with the affected farmers and county officials. The PIUs in the \n22\nNRs will review the VDPs  to ensure that the types and locations of alternative livelihood \nschemes and village improvements conform to the master plans for the NRs. Once each plan \nhas been screened for environmental impact, an agreement will be signed between the NR and \nthe village committee or State farm. RPs, together with the VDPs, will be submitted to the \nprovincial PMO and to ADB for approval. After each plan is approved, land compensation and \nvillage development costs can be disbursed by HPFB (through the County Financial Bureau) \nfrom the counterpart fund to the affected village committee or State farm, and farmers will then \nabandon farming in the NRs. The counterpart funds will pay for the land compensation and all \nresettlement activities in the RPs, including the implementation of the approved VDPs. EA will \nset up an account for the resettlement costs (compensation and village development), which will \nbe managed by HPFB. Internal and external monitoring and evaluation will be conducted to \nensure compliance with ADB's resettlement policy. The summary resettlement framework is in \nAppendix 8. \n47.  Procurement. All supplies, equipment, and services to be financed by ADB will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines for Procurement. For cost efficiency, most items \nwill be procured centrally (by the PMO) for distribution to the subproject areas, spread widely \nover  the  13  project  counties.  The  Government\u2019s  domestic  procurement  procedures  will  be \nfollowed, provided they are acceptable to ADB. Equipment or materials for each contract valued \nat $1,000,000 equivalent or less will be procured through international shopping. Other minor \nmiscellaneous equipment and supply packages, each valued below $100,000 equivalent, will be \nprocured through direct purchase. The force-account procedure will be applied to civil works for \nforest improvement and wetland restoration, i.e., the county governments (the implementing \nagencies) will use their own work force and equipment, since each contract will have a value of \nless  than  $1  million  equivalent  and  the  locations  are  remote,  making  competitive  bidding \nunsuitable. Also, the implementing agencies can efficiently handle civil works at reasonable cost. \nIndicative procurement packages are listed in Appendix 9.  \n48.  Consulting Services. Consultants will be selected and engaged in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and other arrangements acceptable to ADB for \nselecting and engaging domestic consultants. Consulting firms will be selected using ADB\u2019s \nquality- and-cost-based selection method. The total consultant input for the Project is estimated \nat 640 person-months of consulting services: 112 international and 528 domestic. Consultants \nwill be required for water resources, wetland biodiversity and nature reserve management; \necotourism; conservation education, and public awareness subcomponents. The Project will \nalso engage the services of qualified academic/research institutes for studies, surveys, and \nshort- and long-term training programs. The institutes will be selected by HPG according to \ncompetitive selection criteria and procedures acceptable to ADB. The consultant requirements \nare summarized in Appendix 10. The training and education requirements for capacity building \nare summarized in Appendix 11. \n49.  Disbursement Arrangements and Fund Flows. GEF funds will be channeled through \nADB, and ADB will disburse both ADB loan and GEF grant funds to HPFB. To expedite the \ndisbursement of the loan and GEF grant proceeds, HPG will set up imprest accounts in a \ncommercial bank acceptable to ADB, in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook \n                                                 \n21\n  The full resettlement framework and the RPs for Xingkaihu NR in Mishan City and Qixinghe NR in Baoqing county \nhave been posted on ADB\u2019s web site (Supplementary Appendix H, I, and J, respectively).  \n22\n  The percentage of compensation cost allocated for alternative livelihood schemes will depend on the VDP, but is \nestimated to average 30%. \n ", " 15\nof January 2001 and detailed arrangements between the Government and ADB. The initial \ndeposit in the imprest account will not exceed 6 months of estimated expenditure, or 10% of the \ntotal loan amount, whichever is less. HPG will disburse eligible expenditures under the Project \nthrough either (i) the imprest account, to be set up immediately after the loan agreement takes \neffect and managed by HPFB; or (ii) ADB\u2019s direct payment, commitment, force account, or \nreimbursement procedures. ADB\u2019s statement of expenditures (SOE) procedures will be followed \nin liquidating the imprest account and reimbursing individual SOE payments up to $100,000 \nequivalent. \n50.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting. NRs and county PIUs will keep records and \naccounts according to sound accounting principles and in sufficient detail to identify subprojects \nfinanced by the loan and to disclose the use of funds under the Project. The records and \naccounts will be forwarded regularly to the provincial PMO. HPFB will be responsible for overall \nproject  accounting  and  will  ensure  that  the  consolidated  provincial  project  accounts  are \nprepared for final consolidation and audited yearly by independent auditors acceptable to ADB. \nThe audit report should include a separate audit opinion on the use of the imprest account and \nSOE procedures. The audited financial statements will be submitted to ADB not later than 9 \nmonths after each fiscal year. The PIUs will submit quarterly reports to the PMO detailing \nimplementation activities, physical and financial accomplishments, problems encountered or \n23\nanticipated, and actions taken to resolve the problems.  The PMO will compile quarterly reports \nfrom the PIUs and submit the compilation to ADB for review. Also, the PMO will prepare \nconsolidated project progress reports twice a year, following the project performance report \nformat proposed by ADB at inception. Within 6 months after project completion, the PMO will \nprepare, in coordination with the PIUs, and submit to ADB a completion report summarizing loan \nand  grant  funds  utilization,  project  implementation,  attainment  of  objectives  and  targets, \nimplementation  experience,  project  performance,  actual  costs  incurred,  benefits,  and  other \ninformation requested by ADB or GEF. Copies of annual reports, and other reports as required, \nwill be provided to GEF. \n51.  Project Review. The PMO will submit an annual work plan and annual reports to be \nreviewed in meetings with the PSC, ADB, and GEF, and will also be responsible for the final \nreport. The PMO will prepare progress reports every 6 months, indicating progress, problems \nmet in the past 6 months, remedies taken or proposed, proposed program of activities, and \nprogress expected in the next 6 months. In year 3, ADB and GEF will conduct a comprehensive \nmidterm review and detailed evaluation of the Project, including an assessment of (i) the project \ndesign and scope as formulated at appraisal; (ii) HPFD\u2019s capacity for effective implementation, \nand  PIU  effectiveness  in  implementing  the  Project;  (iii)  physical  and  financial  progress  of \nimplementation (including contracts and disbursements), and performance of consultants; and \n24\n(iv)  beneficiary  participation.  The  project  performance  management  system  (PPMS)  will \nsupport regular and timely feedback between components, as well as project performance \nreports updated every 6 months, to guide the adjustment of project activities to enhance their \neffectiveness and beneficial impact.  \n52.  Advance  Action  and  Retroactive  Financing. The Government has requested and \nADB  has  approved  (i)  advance  procurement  action  for  early  planting  of  seedings,  and \n(ii) retroactive financing of eligible expenses (i.e., ground preparation, seedlings and planting, \nand  advance  mobilization  payment  for  consultants  preparing  subproject  feasibility  reports), \nincurred by HPG on or after 15 September 2004, up to $200,000 equivalent. HPG has been \n                                                 \n23\n  HPG can effectively manage its financial resources and has already dealt with several ADB-funded projects. To \nstrengthen the project accounting and auditing systems and the Forest Department\u2019s capacity to manage financial \nresources, implementation support includes the services of financial management specialists. \n24\n  The PPMS is described in detail in Supplementary Appendix K. \n ", "16  \nadvised that approval of advance actions and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to \nfinance the proposed Project.  \n53.  Anticorruption Policy. ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy was explained to the Government \nand HPG's attention was drawn to the section on fraud and corruption in ADB\u2019s Guidelines for \nProcurement  and  Guidelines on  the  Use  of Consultants,  particularly  the  need  for  bidders, \nsuppliers, contractors, and consultants to observe the highest standard of ethics in procuring \nand executing ADB-financed contracts, and the sanctions if fraud and corruption are discovered. \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACT, AND RISKS  \n54.  The Project derives its overall economic rationale from the need to protect globally \nsignificant flora and fauna, reduce natural resource losses, achieve sustainable management of \nwetland  NRs,  and  improve  the  economic  potential  of  forest  areas  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain. \nIncreasing the forest cover and improving water resource planning will strengthen wetland \nprotection and promote balanced agricultural development in an environmentally sustainable \nmanner. More balanced allocation and use of water resources will bring local economic benefits, \nas they will help reduce flooding and drought and recharge groundwater. Restoring the wetlands \nand  protecting  endangered  species  will  increase  biodiversity  in  the  Plain.  Institutional \nstrengthening in forestry and NR management activities, training, and campaigns to make the \npublic more aware of the value of biodiversity will also bring substantial incremental global \nbenefits  over  the  long  term.  Alternative  income-generating  opportunities,  including  village \ndevelopment  plan-supported  alternative  livelihood  enterprises,  agroforestry,  and  NTFP  will \nensure that the affected communities will stay away from natural resources as their primary \nincome sources, thus promoting sustainable development. Project intervention at the national \nlevel is further justified as (i) converting barren lands to forests, and (ii) reverting farmland to \nlegally assigned forestland with intercropping and NTFP activities are expected to bring higher \nnet benefits. \nA.  Financial and Economic Benefits \n55.  The  financial  analysis  for  the  Project  focused  on  revenue-generating  activities:  (i) \nestablishment of new forest plantations of native species of larch and poplar, and treatment of \nexisting  forest  plantations  of  the  same  species;  (ii)  agroforestry  and  intercropping;  and \n(iii) investments  in  NTFPs,  particularly  potherbs,  berry  fruit,  and  wild  grapes.  The  overall \nfinancial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the Project is 14.9%, which is higher than the weighted \n25\naverage cost of capital (WACC) of 6.1%.  The overall project net present value (NPV) is \nCNY124.33 million. Therefore, the proposed Project is financially viable. The FIRR and NPV by \nnature of activity and by county were also calculated. The computations show that all types of \nactivities are financially viable, and so are the operations programmed for each county. The \nFIRR is lowest (8.8%) for new forest plantations of larch because of the long waiting period of \n20 years from planting to harvest. Hegang, Jidong, Linkou, and Qitaihe have lower FIRRs than \nother counties, only slightly more than 10%, because they are programmed for planting more \nheavily with larch (yielding lower returns than poplar) in new plantations and treated stands. \nSensitivities for FIRRs and financial NPVs were computed at plus and minus 10% of the (i) \nwood price, (ii) wood harvest, (iii) investment costs, and (iv) total costs. The results show that  \nunfavorable changes do not reduce the FIRRs below the WACC, neither in the aggregate nor in \nany particular county. A switching value analysis was conducted for wood prices, which turned \nout to be the most sensitive variable in the sensitivity analysis. A drop of 12% in wood prices will \nstill allow for a viable operation in the counties with the lowest FIRR. Details of the financial \nanalysis are in Appendix 12.  \n                                                 \n25\n The FIRR has been computed on an incremental basis, after tax in real terms. The WACC is also computed in real \nterms on an after-tax basis. \n ", " 17\n56.   Economic evaluation of the Project focused on the economic benefits and costs of \nforestry and NTFP investments. The significantly positive annualized NPV per hectare of land \nconverted from currently barren lands to legally required forestlands (zero versus CNY2,078/ \nha) gives strong economic justification for the Project. On the other hand, when the current \ncroplands revert to the legally required forestlands, combining forest and NTFP investments to \nreplace crop cultivation opportunities lost may provide economic justification. Economic analysis \nwas conducted for the project duration of 25 years, including construction. The costs and \nbenefits were expressed in yuan in constant 2004 prices. In the case of economic NPVs, a \ndiscount rate of 12% was applied. A shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 was applied to all \nfinancial costs and benefits to derive the economic cost and benefit streams. The economic \nwage rate of unskilled labor is 80% of the financial wage rates. The major benefits from forestry \nplantation were related to timber before tax, expressed in economic prices. Economic benefits \nderived from NTFPs were adjusted to reflect economic values based on the financial benefits. \nIncremental economic costs include investment costs and expenditures expressed in economic \nvalue  for  the  forestry  plantation  components  but  not  the  GEF-supported  investments.  The \neconomic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project as a whole is 24.8%, higher than the \neconomic opportunity costs of capital (12%). The economic NPV, at a 12% discount rate is \nCNY93.03 million, which is positive. Therefore, the Project is economically viable. Details of the \neconomic analysis are also in Appendix 12.  \nB.  Environmental Impact and Benefits  \n57.  The  Project  falls  under  environmental  category  B.  An  overall  initial  environmental \n26\nexamination (IEE)  was undertaken to assess the generic impact of each Project component. \nThe IEE shows that the Project will bring significant environmental benefits and have a positive \nimpact on both the project area environment and globally important biodiversity by increasing \nforest cover, improving wetland hydrology, restoring degraded wetlands, improving the status of \nthreatened  wildlife,  providing  wetland  conservation  education,  and  establishing  wetland \nmanagement  capacity.  The  IEE  also  shows  that  the  potential  negative  effects  on  the \nenvironment  are  localized  and  short-term  but  not  significant,  and  can  be  fully  mitigated. \nTherefore, no full environmental impact assessment is required.  \n58.  The  six  project  NRs  were  selected  because  they  support  significant  populations  of \nglobally  threatened  species,  whose  survival  depends  on  the  successful  implementation  of \ninterventions  to  remove  the  root  causes  of  problems  and  threats.  The  benefits  of  these \ninterventions\u2014predominantly conservation activities\u2014therefore accrue to the global community. \nThe benefits include (i) expanded breeding and foraging habitats of birds and other wildlife, and, \nhence, increased populations of globally threatened species; (ii) improved management at the \nlocal and watershed levels, leading to secure water resources for wetlands, support for globally \nthreatened biodiversity, and improved habitat quality, and thus to increased wildlife populations; \n(iii) increased carbon sequestration in standing wood and forest soils through reforestation and \nsustainable forest management; and (iv) minimized threats to globally endangered wildlife as a \nresult of greater public awareness of globally threatened biodiversity and the importance of \nwetlands  in  environmental  conservation.  Replicating  and  scaling  up  the  model  framework \nthroughout the Sanjiang Plain will intensify these global environmental benefits. \n59.  Local communities will benefit from restored wetland functions, such as water storage for \nuse in the dry season and groundwater replenishment. In upland areas, barren lands and \nmarginal  agricultural  lands  will  be  put  to  more  appropriate  use,  for  forest  plantation.  The \nconversion will reduce erosion, improve water infiltration, and lead to a more reliable supply to \nstreams  and  aquifers  during  the  dry  season.  Because  of  wider  tree  spacing,  agroforestry \nintercropping as well as the growing of NTFP crops, can be promoted. Global and national \n                                                 \n26\n The IEE along with the environmental management plan is in Supplementary Appendix L. \n ", "18  \nenvironmental benefits will accrue from the establishment of ecotourism guidelines that will help \nreduce adverse effects, limit inappropriate development, and ensure sustainability. Both NTFP \nenterprises and ecotourism development will stimulate local employment. The promotion of \nenvironment-friendly  livelihood  enterprises  will  provide  long-term  financial  benefits  to \ncommunities and heighten the demonstration potential of the Project. \nC.  Social Dimensions and Impact on Poverty \n60.  The Project will provide employment opportunities to state farm forestry workers in tree \nplanting, stand treatment, logging, and wood transport. During the implementation period, there \nwill be work opportunities for 7 months for about 36,000 forestry workers on larch plantations, \nand for 6 months for about 10,000 forestry workers on poplar plantations. Preferential access to \nemployment and intercropping agroforestry opportunities will increase incomes for the Project\u2019s \nbeneficiary forestry workers. Investments in various NTFPs such as potherbs, berry fruit, and \nwild grapes will increase off-season income and employment benefits. \n61.  In  accordance  with  resettlement  and  village  development  plans,  about  30%  of \nresettlement  compensation  from  the  counterpart  funds  will  finance  village  development \ninvestments in alternative livelihood activities. The actual mix and scale of alternative livelihood \noutputs  in  each  village  are,  by  intent,  not  predetermined,  as  the  Project  aims  to  be  both \nparticipatory and flexible. Farmers and villages affected by wetland restoration activities can \nthemselves decide the most suitable types of alternative livelihood investments, instead of being \nprovided with a blueprint. The farmers are mostly concerned with the yields and price of their \ngrain  crops.  Village  development  can  add  value  to  their  farm  outputs  through  support  for \nagroprocessing businesses. The benefits of alternative enterprises under VDPs are expected to \noutweigh simple cash resettlement compensation, as that result will (i) ensure longer term \nproject benefits to the intended beneficiaries,; (ii) provide a model framework that can be \nreplicated beyond project implementation, and (iii) assist the Government in adopting a model of \ncompensation, not as sunk cost but as sustainable investment opportunities. \n62.  Impact on Poverty. Poverty incidence is 9.7% in Heilongjiang and about 10% in the \nproject areas. Of the 13 project counties in the Sanjiang Plain, 4 are nationally designated poverty \ncounties (Fuyuan, Huanan, Raohe, and Tongjiang), with a slightly higher poverty incidence (15%). \nOverall, the Project will enhance livelihood enterprises in agriculture and create new economic \nopportunities  for  state  forest  workers  through  intercropping,  NTFPs,  and  VDPs.  Benefit \ndistribution and poverty impact analysis shows that the poverty impact ratio of the Project is \nabout 22%. The Project is classified as a \u201cGeneral intervention\u201d (Appendix 13).  \n63.  Ethnic Minorities. The Project\u2019s components and locations have all been identified, and \nno  significant  adverse  impact  on  ethnic  minority  villages  or  groups  is  envisaged.  Ethnic \nindividuals who may be affected by project activities will be compensated and, if required, \nspecial measures will be included in the RPs. Based on ADB\u2019s Policy on Indigenous Peoples, a \nfull  plan  is  not  required  but  a  specific  action  for  indigenous  peoples  is  included  in  the \nresettlement framework. \n64.  Gender. Women in the Project areas are actively involved in both productive activities \nand household chores, except where physical strength is required (e.g., for logging or wood \ntransport). Men and women have equal access to land resources. However, women are less \nwell-represented than men are in decisions on public affairs and are burdened with household \nchores, and may, for these reasons, receive less awareness training in the value of wildlife or \nwetlands  biodiversity  conservation.  The  project  strategies  intended  to  promote  gender \nawareness and sensitivity in training and awareness programs should therefore have a positive \nimpact on women. \n ", " 19\nD.  Project Risks \n65.  The  removal  of  threats  to  wetland  biodiversity  in  the  Sanjiang  Plain  requires  the \nfollowing: (i) cooperation among resource authorities in integrating watershed management with \ndevelopment and conservation planning, (ii) improved NR management through better-trained \npersonnel,  (iii) mutually  beneficial  relationships  between  protected  areas  and  surrounding \ncommunities, and (iv) sustainable financial support to NR management. The project design \nrecommends measures to minimize the risks of failure.   \n66.  Cooperation to Integrate Resource Management. Integrated watershed management \nis a new concept in the Sanjiang Plain. The UNDP-GEF Sustainable Use of Wetlands in China \nProject established provincial wetland management authorities (WMAs) in an attempt to foster \ncross-sector contribution to wetland biodiversity management. The WMAs were only partly \neffective because of their geographic and institutional distance from the wetlands. The proposed \nProject will establish local working groups in the target pilot NRs. Working group members will \nrepresent all local stakeholders in water and biodiversity resource management. \n67.  Improved NR Management. Barriers to the success of the 5-year Project must be \nremoved early on. NR management standards are low at present, partly because equipment \nand materials for basic functions, such as field surveys, long-term monitoring, data analysis and \nreporting, and patrol and enforcement, are lacking. NRs should be supported with appropriate \ntechnologies and their capacity should be enhanced through short- and long-term training.  \n68.  Alternative Livelihood. If the proposed activities were to impoverish or disenfranchise \nlocal communities, the Project would be less likely to succeed. To foster community support, the \nProject will address the need for alternative livelihood enterprises at both forest and wetland \nsites. Communities will also be involved in programs to reduce NR resource exploitation and will \nparticipate in local watershed working groups. A public awareness and conservation education \nprogram will make the communities more aware of the relationship between resource protection \nand community welfare. \n69.  Sustainable Financial Support to NR Management. Several factors will contribute to \nthe  sustainability  of  project  benefits  beyond  the  life  of  the  Project.  One  is  the  financial \ncommitment of the Government to conserve the wetlands. Innovative approaches to providing \nalternative livelihood for forest workers and the adoption of VDPs as part of RPs will enhance \nbenefits from investment alternatives rather than burden the Government with sunk cost. To \nstrengthen the financial sustainability of NR management, HPG will improve the financial returns \nfrom  forest  sector  development  through  better  management  of  existing  forests,  and  will \nsuccessively increase its yearly budget for recurrent costs of NR management from CNY0 to 2, \n4, 6, and 8 /ha during implementation.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES  \nA.   Specific Assurances \n70.  In addition to the standard assurances, the PRC Government and HPG have given the \nfollowing assurances, which are incorporated in the legal documents: \n(i)  Environmental issues. The HPG will ensure that  \n(a)  the  Project  complies  with  applicable  PRC  environmental  laws  and \nregulations and ADB\u2019s Environmental Policy (2002). \n(b)  HPFD,  HPG  and  county  environmental  protection  bureaus  (EPBs) \nimplement  the  environmental  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nrequirements as outlined in the IEE and the environmental management \nplan  (EMP);  further,  HPG  will  ensure  that  an  appropriate  budgetary \n ", "20  \nallocation  (including  vehicles,  materials  and  equipment,  operating \nexpenses, and staff) is provided to HPFD, HPEPB, and the county EPBs \nto fulfill their responsibilities for implementing mitigating measures and \nmonitoring requirements as outlined in the IEE and EMP; \n(c)  before starting activities in components 1, 2, and 3, the preparation of \ncounty-  level  environmental  plans  for  siting  and  establishing  of  new \nplantations and operating new and existing plantations, the environmental \nmanagement  plans  for  recoveries  in  each  NR,  and  all  individual \nsubprojects will be subject to the environmental assessment and review \nprocedures for subprojects outlined in the IEE and EMP; and \n(d)  adequate  budget  and  human  resources  are  made  available  for  the \nimplementation  of  EMPs  and  any  mitigation  measures  and  monitoring \nrequirements that may arise for the environmental assessment and review \nof subprojects. \n(ii)  Experimental  zone  of  nature  reserves.  HPG  will  commit  the  necessary \nresources to enforce the National Regulation of Nature Reserves and the related \nHeilongjiang  provincial  regulations  regarding  permissible  activities  in  the \nexperimental zone of NRs, to limit incompatible and unsustainable practices, and \nto promote the intended conservation management purposes of the three zones. \nTaking into account the relevant recommendations of the ADB TA for Support for \nEnvironmental Legislation in the PRC and the legal consultant financed under the \nProject, HPG will prepare and submit for the consideration of the Heilongjiang \nProvincial People's Congress draft amendments to the Heilongjiang provincial \nregulations, so that the activities permitted in the experimental zone of NRs are \nconsistent  with  the  protection  of  wetland  nature  reserves  and  promotion  of \nbiodiversity. \n(iii)  Conversion of farmland to forest. In converting farmland to forest, the HPG will \nensure, among others, that (a) a new forest plantation is not adjacent to or near \n(within 1 kilometer) a NR; (b) an appropriate buffer zone is maintained between \nthe plantation and any riparian zones or sensitive habitats; (c) affected forestry \nworkers  and  villagers  receive  wage  income  from  tree  planting;  (d)  an  area \nequivalent to 20% of the converted farmland is used for planting NTFPs to benefit \naffected workers or villagers; (e) for the first 3-5 years, intercropping is allowed at \na  nominal  annual  contract  fee  (around  CNY6\u2013CNY7  per  mu);  and  (f)  the \nremaining farmland is recontracted to all workers or villagers within each forest \nfarm, so that they share equally in the benefits. \n(iv)  Ecotourism.  In  consultation  with  ADB,  HPG  will  prepare  a  comprehensive \necotourism master plan and detailed planning and environmental guidelines for \nthe project NRs, and make the plan and guidelines publicly available, for possible \nreplication elsewhere. \n(v)  Endangered species. The HPG will develop and implement a public awareness \nprogram  regarding  endangered  species,  and  strengthen  the  enforcement  of \npenalties for violations of the relevant laws and regulations. \n(vi)  Resettlement.  HPG  will  ensure  that  any  resettlement  conforms,  in  a  timely \nmanner, to the relevant PRC laws and regulations, ADB\u2019s Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement (1995), and the resettlement framework agreed between HPG and \nADB. The activities will include (a) preparing subproject RPs acceptable to ADB \nbefore any subproject activities and before award of civil works contracts for each \nsubproject (for the six NRs with farmland-to-wetland restoration); (b) submitting to \n ", " 21\nADB for approval any NR RPs and VDPs before farmers are displaced and \nbefore award of civil works contracts for each subproject; (c) submitting to ADB \nupdated RPs for Qixinghe and Xingkaihu after subproject detailed design and \nlivelihood development plan for ADB review and approval; (d) consulting with and \ndisclosing subproject RPs to affected persons and the public, and on the ADB \nweb site; (e) making provisions for compensation eligibility, compensation rates, \nrehabilitation measures, institutional arrangements, resettlement costs, grievance \nredress,  and  monitoring  and  evaluation;  and  (f)  ensuring  that  in  relevant \nsubprojects, compensation and allowances are paid and assets are replaced \nbefore displacement of affected people. \n(vii)  Village  development.  HPG  will  ensure  that  (a)  a  portion  of  the  land \ncompensation  and  resettlement  costs  under  the  Project  is  used  for  village \ndevelopment;  and  (b)  village  development  plans  for  alternative  livelihood \nschemes and community infrastructure improvements, and their activities and \nlocations are compatible with the master plans for the NRs. Once a plan is \napproved  by  the  provincial  PMO  and  ADB,  counterpart  funds  for  village \ndevelopment will be disbursed by HPFB through the County Financial Bureau to \nthe affected village committee or State farm. Financing for village development \nwill  be  subject  to  guidelines  and  procedures  including  the  following:  (a)  the \nalternative  livelihood  investments  were  identified  with  the  participation  of  the \naffected persons (APs), and are eco-friendly according to the evaluation criteria \nin the EMP and compatible with the master plans for the NRs; (b) APs and then \nthe hosts will have priority with respect to use; and (c) training and technical \nassistance for alternative livelihood schemes and environmental protection will be \nprovided  if  the  investment  proposals  fit  the  \u201cgreen,\u201d  eco-friendly  investment \ncriteria in the EMP. \n(viii)  Pilot testing and replicability. HPFD will pilot-test, monitor, and evaluate the \nfarmland-to-wetland  model  and  forestland  restoration  subprojects.  HPG  will \nensure that manuals are prepared based on pilot testing, and these manuals \nincorporate  lessons  learned,  so  that  they  can  be  used  for  other  wetland \nrestoration.  HPG  will  ensure  that  such  subprojects  (including  intercropping, \nNTFPs,  and  village  development  as  part  of  resettlement  compensation)  are \nreplicable and can be scaled up, particularly in connection with the Master Plan \nfor Heilongjiang Province Wetland Restoration. \n(ix)  Master Plan for Heilongjiang Province Wetland Restoration. HPG will take \nthe necessary actions to promptly obtain NDRC endorsement of the Master Plan \nand then apply the model approach developed under the Project more widely to \nrestorations under such plan, as appropriate to specific sites. \n(x)  Participation. HPG will ensure that stakeholders in the project area (including \nwomen, minority groups, and the poor) participate in project design, management, \nand implementation, including the formulation of the NR master plan, watershed \nmanagement  plan,  alternative  livelihood  programs,  ecotourism  planning  and \ndevelopment, and project employment opportunities. HPG shall implement an \nincentive  framework  to  encourage  and  maintain  stakeholder  ownership  and \nsupport for the Project, in particular for the alternative livelihoods development \ncomponent and conservation management activities. \n(xi)  Exit strategy.  In consultation with ADB, HPG will implement the exit strategy \ndeveloped under the Project to refine policy measures and carry out activities in \nintegrated watershed and wetland NR management following Project completion. \nThe strategy will be carried out during Project implementation to strengthen the \n ", "22  \noverall sustainability of financing requirements and sources, capacity building, \nand institutional mechanisms for local and intersectoral planning and cooperation. \nFor  the  financial  sustainability  of  NR  management,  HPFD,  county  forestry \nbureaus, and State farms will successively increase budget amounts by CNY2 \nha/yr from CNY0 ha/yr in year 1 to CNY8 ha/yr in year 5. \n(xii)  Counterpart funds. The HPG will ensure the timely provision of all counterpart \nfunds  required  for  the  successful  implementation  of  the  Project,  including \nincremental  recurrent  costs,  land  compensation,  resettlement  costs  and  post \ncompletion recurrent costs. The HPG will ensure that the counterpart funds for \nthe land compensation and resettlement costs for the State farms are provided \nfrom the funds allocated by the central and local governments. \n(xiii)  Monitoring and evaluation. In consultation with ADB, HPG will establish and \nimplement  a  project  performance  monitoring  system,  including  performance \nindicators  relating  to  forestry  development,  wetland  restoration,  NTFPs, \nresettlement and alternative livelihood schemes, counterpart financing for village \ndevelopment, ecotourism, and beneficiary participation.  HPG and ADB will carry \nout a midterm review in 2008 on issues including the implementation of the exit \nstrategy, incentive framework, and beneficiary participation. \nB.  Condition for Loan Effectiveness \n71.  Effectiveness of the Loan Agreement will be subject to the following special condition: \nconfirmation of GEF financing through the endorsement by the Chief Executive Officer of the \nGEF Secretariat. \n \nVI.  RECOMMENDATION  \n72.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of Agreement of the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve \n \n(i)  the loan of $15,000,000 to the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Sanjiang Plain \nWetlands Protection Project from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources, with interest \nto  be  determined  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate \n(LIBOR)-based lending facility; a term of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 \nyears; and such other terms and conditions as are substantially in accordance \nwith those set forth in the draft Loan and Project Agreements presented to the \nBoard; and  \n \n(ii)  the administration by ADB of a grant not exceeding the equivalent of $12,140,000 \nto the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China for the Sanjiang Plain \nWetlands Protection Project to be provided by the Global Environment Facility. \n \n \n  Haruhiko Kuroda \n                                                                                                                  President \n \n15 February 2005 \n ", "    Appendix 1         23      \nPROJECT FRAMEWORK  \nDesign Summary  Performance Indicators/Targets  Monitoring Mechanisms  Assumptions/Risks \nGoal:       \nImproved management of  Conservation status of eight key globally  World Conservation Union   \nnatural resources to protect  threatened species in the Sanjiang Plain  biodiversity surveys \nglobally significant species  lifted from the lists of endangered-to-  \nand to sustain economic  vulnerable species \ndevelopment \nPurpose:       \nAchieve an integrated  By 2010, populations of native species  NR and provincial wetland  Assumptions: \nconservation and  in 6 target NRs up by at least 10%  inventories  Provincial regulation \ndevelopment model to  (improved biodiversity)   Targeted NR species  preventing further \nprotect natural resources of  By 2010, nature reserve (NR) and  censuses and associated  wetland conversion in \nthe Sanjiang Plain wetlands  watershed water resource management  habitat surveys  NRs is enforced. \nand their watersheds  mechanisms in the Sanjiang Plain \nRed Data Book and other  Government follows \n(biodiversity, water, forests),  established and/or integrate wetland \nendangered species status  through on its \nfrom continued threats, and  water requirements  \nreports  commitment to \nto improve the well being of \nIncome status of affected villages  implement the \nNR water allocation surveys \nlocal communities \nmaintained or increased through  SFA/NDRC Farmland to \nForest cover assessments \nenvironmentally sustainable alternative  Wetland Restoration \nlivelihood mechanisms  Socioeconomic surveys  Program. \nBy 2010, wetland restoration model   Reports detailing changes in \nreplicated in 5-6 additional Sanjiang  water resource management \nPlain wetland NRs   strategies (e.g., from \nengineered solutions to \nnonstructural solutions) \nNational poverty census \nstatistics \nOutputs:       \n1.

The Global Environment Facility (GEF) project design is based on threats analysis to \nremove the underlying causes of the problems identified. To facilitate project design, an analysis \nidentified the immediate threats to biodiversity, along with underlying and root causes and \npossible avenues for addressing them. The outcome of the analysis is illustrated in Figure A2. \nThe indicative threats analysis is summarized in Table A2. An extensive discussion, history of \nthese threats, and an account of current threats are in Supplementary Appendix M. \n \n2.  The  indicative  threats  analysis  identified  four  main  threats  to  globally  significant \nbiodiversity in the Sanjiang Plain: as (i) changes in hydrology/desiccation; (ii) conversion to \nfarmland; (iii) inappropriate practices in the use of resources (overexploitation of resources, \ndisturbances, and habitat degradation); and (iv) limited conservation awareness and capacity of \nnature reserve (NR) staff and adjacent communities. Underlying causes of water pollution are \nclosely related to incorrect use or overuse of agricultural fertilizers in their farming activities and \nfarmers\u2019 awareness on conservation. Following this analysis and the logical framework, the four \nmain  threats  (and  their  underlying  causes)  are  targeted  by  four  closely  linked  project \ncomponents, each with a set of subcomponents that address various aspects of the underlying \ncauses.   \n \n3.  Some of the underlying causes will not be addressed by the present Project, as they are \nalready the focus of another project or beyond the scope of a GEF intervention. One of the \nunaddressed  underlying  causes  pertains  to  NR  legislation,  regulations  and  zoning,  and \ndifferences in how they are applied or interpreted at national and provincial levels. An Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) technical assistance,1 being developed at present that will address \nenvironmental  legislation.  The  underlying  cause  of  pressures  on  natural  resources  due  to \nincreases  in  the  human  population  is  regarded  as  being  outside  the  scope  of  a  GEF \nintervention.  \n \nTable A2:

Broad Development Objective \n \n1.  The northeastern part of the People's Republic of China (PRC) is one of the last areas in \nthis huge and biologically rich country to be drained and converted to agriculture. Because of \nthis late development, threats and risks are high on some of the last remaining tracts of wetland \nand native forests with their associated biological diversity, including many endangered and rare \nspecies.   \n \n2.  The PRC gives high priority to wetland biodiversity conservation, watershed protection \nand sustainable management of natural resources. By the end of 2000 the PRC had established \n1,276 nature reserves (NRs) covering 123 million hectares (ha), or 12.4% of the national land \narea. Some 12 million ha of the total protects wetlands, representing nearly half of the estimated \ntotal of 25 million ha of natural wetlands in the PRC. The PRC ratified the Ramsar Convention \non  31  July  1992,  and  three  wetland  NRs  (Honghe,  Sanjiang,  and  Xingkaihu  NRs)  in  the \nSanjiang Plain are listed as wetlands of international importance (i.e., Ramsar sites). The PRC \nsubsequently ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity on 5 January 1993, followed by \nnotification of participation in the restructured GEF on 16 May 1994. The PRC\u2019s Biodiversity \nConservation Action Plan gives conservation of the Sanjiang Plain highest priority.  \n \n3.  The Sanjiang Plain (or Three Rivers Plain) is located in Heilongjiang Province in the far \nnortheastern part of the PRC. The Plain formerly extended over 108,900 (km\u00b2), with half forest \nand half wetlands, but these forest and wetlands have been reduced to one fifth of their original \narea, mainly due to the expansion of agriculture. Key wetlands and globally threatened species \nare now primarily found in NRs, but management of these areas is beset with challenges. Given \nthe presence of key populations of globally important species in the Sanjiang Plain, the Project \nis expected to have significant global environmental benefits.  \n \nB.  Rationale for GEF Involvement \n \n4.  The Sanjiang Plain has some of the PRC\u2019s most important and largest (almost one \nmillion ha, or 10,000 km2) floodplain wetlands. Located on this plain are 28 of Heilongjiang\u2019s 58 \nwetland NRs of which the 6 key NRs (Anbanghe, Dajihe, Naolihe,Qixinghe, Xingkaihu, and \nZhenbaodao) will be targeted by the Project. The six NRs support key populations of 23 species \nlisted by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as globally threatened \n(i.e.,  endangered  or  vulnerable),  and  include  breeding  populations  of  Oriental  stork,  red-\ncrowned crane, white-naped crane, Baikal teal and Chinese softshell turtle. The six support \nunique wetland habitats that have largely disappeared in the region, nowadays. \n \n5.  In 1998, the Heilongjiang provincial government (HPG) issued a decree suspending \nwetland  development  in  the  province  and  preventing  further  conversion  to  farmland;  the \nsuspension  was  reinforced  in  June  2003  with  the  adoption  of  the  Regulation  on  Wetland \nConservation of Heilongjiang Province. To address losses, HPG developed plans for restoring \nof >150,000 ha (or 1,500 km2) of farmland to wetlands within wetland NRs in the Sanjiang Plain, \nand in 2003 the provincial Forestry Department began implementing of the restoration program.  \n \n6.  The Project aims at sustainable management of natural resources to protect globally \nsignificant  species  and  promote  economic  development.  The  Project\u2019s  global  biodiversity \nobjective is to protect the Sanjiang Plain wetland ecosystems and their associated globally \nsignificant biodiversity by relieving threats and associated root causes of their decline. Globally \nsignificant biodiversity in the Sanjiang Plain faces four main threats, namely, (i) changes in ", "36  Appendix 4 \nhydrology/desiccation, (ii) conversion to farmland, (iii) inappropriate land use practices, and \n(iv) limited conservation awareness and capacity of NR staff and adjacent communities. These \nthreats and their underlying causes will be targeted by four interdependent Project components \n \n(i)  Component 1. Outcome: NR watershed management improved. The Project \nwill increase forest cover, improve forest management (to reduce surface runoff, \nand increasing soil water retention and groundwater recharge), and enhance \nwatershed-level water resource management.  \n \n(ii)  Component 2. Outcome: Biodiversity protection in wetland NRs enhanced. \nThe Project will develop models and the capacity for wetland NR conservation \nmanagement, and embed component outputs in NR management plans.  \n \n(iii)  Component 3.  Outcome: Alternative livelihoods developed and sustained. \nThe project will develop and implement programs for sustainable livelihood in \nvillages  affected  by  the  reforestation  program  (under  component  1)  and \nfarmland-to-wetland  restoration  (under  component  2)1  to  ensure  that  the \nrestoration programs have lasting beneficial effects.  \n \n(iv)  Component  4.    Outcome:  Conservation  awareness  and  capacity  for \nsustainable management of wetland NR biodiversity increased. The Project \nwill  develop  and  implement  conservation  education  at  local  schools,  public \nawareness programs for State farms and communities in/around NRs; and a \ntargeted training program for NR staff and other stakeholders. This will be directly \nlinked to component 2; for example, development of the NR management plan \nand  species  recovery  plans  will  be  incorporated  into  the  long-term  training \nprogram. \n \n7.  The Project is fully compliant with the GEF operational strategy in the focal area of \nbiodiversity and consistent with GEF\u2019s Operational Program 2 (OP#2) aimed at conservation \nand sustainable use of biological resources in coastal, marine, and freshwater ecosystems. The \nproject may further have linkages with the other OPs as sustainable development activities. \nHowever, efficiencies are achieved in the Project by combining complementary baseline and \nincremental activities as an integrated package. Individual programs alone would contribute to \nonly local and national benefits. But when integrated, the linkages provided by sustainable \ndevelopment activities will further enhance global incremental benefits, which largely contribute \nto the objectives of OP#2. The Project will also enhance the objectives of \n \n(i)  OP#3 Forest Ecosystems, as a total of 11,900 ha of new forest plantations will be \nplanted on degraded, unproductive farmland and deforested/eroding areas. In \naddition, 43,700 ha of existing forestry plantations will be subjected to improved \nmanagement and upgrading; \n(ii)  OP#12 Integrated Ecosystem Management, as it takes an integrated, basin wide \napproach to the management of water and other natural resources, and will \nestablish an institutional framework (based on existing structures) to achieve this; \nand  \n(iii)  OP#15 Sustainable Land Management, as management of catchments will be \nupgraded and vastly improved via the forestry program (i), and also assist with \n                                                      \n1\n No physical resettlement of people is involved, but the compensation is for loss of access to farmland in the NRs. \nDue to readjustment of villages' remaining land, village collectives rather than individuals are affected. \n \n ", "Appendix 4  37 \nidentifying, developing, and promoting sustainable land management in areas \nadjacent to/near the wetland protected areas.  \n \n8.  The Project aims at developing models that can be replicated to provide much-needed \nexamples for ongoing provincial programs. This approach is fully compatible with the objectives \nof  GEF\u2019s  Strategic  Priority  BD-1:  catalyzing  sustainability  of  protected  areas;  BD-2: \nmainstreaming biodiversity in production landscapes and sectors; and BD-4: generation and \ndissemination of best practices for addressing current and emerging biodiversity issues. The \nProject will significantly contribute to BD-1, BD-2, and BD-4, as outlined in Project Contribution \nto Operational Programs and Strategic Directions of GEF Business.2  \n \n9.  Sustainability of benefits and achievements beyond the completion of the GEF Project \nwill be positively affected by (i) promulgation of the Regulation on Wetland Conservation of \nHeilongjiang Province, which took effect on 1 August 2003, and lays a solid foundation for long-\nterm improvement in wetland conservation in the Sanjiang Plain; (ii) financial commitments \nconfirmed  by  HPG  for  implementing  of  the  farmland-to-wetland  and  farmland-to-forest \nrestoration  programs;  (iii)  availability  of  already  ongoing  financial  assistance  by  National \nDevelopment  Reform  Commission  (NDRC)  for  affected  communities  from  the  farmland-to-\nwetland program, rather than the simple provision of funds directly as compensation; (iv) strong \ncommitment of the PRC Government to improve water resource management, among others, \nby improving watershed management; (v) development of practical/workable models for wetland \nrestoration (including restoration of local livelihood schemes) that are targeted to the local \nsituation in the Sanjiang Plain; (vi) strong emphasis of the Project on capacity building; this is \nincluded in each of the components, especially component 4, which is entirely focused on \neducation, awareness education, and training, along with development of training modules and \ncurricula; (vii) emphasis on interagency collaboration under a single provincial government and \nin all project areas under the jurisdiction of Heilongjiang Province,  increases sustainability.   \n \n10.  HPG has agreed to utilize wetland restoration models (including livelihood restoration) \ndeveloped by the Project in its farmland-to-wetland restoration program, under which over \n150,000 ha will be restored to wetland NRs in the Sanjiang Plain alone. Funds have been \nallocated for this replication by NDRC. The Project will facilitate the program by providing much-\nneeded examples of how restoration can be achieved successfully, and maximizing benefits to \nbiodiversity  conservation.  The  watershed-level  water  resources  management  approach  will \nprovide a model for water resources management (and allocation for conservation) to the Song-\nLiao Water Resources Commission, allowing replication in subcatchments in the entire Songhua \nRiver basin and much of northeast PRC. The production of training manuals and development \nof training curricula will facilitate further replicability of the model framework. In particular, the \nProject will be led by one provincial government, facilitating interagency coordination of water, \nforestry, agriculture, and environmental protection departments. Thus, lessons learned will be of \ngreat value in the course of replication in other contexts under the broader framework of river \nbasin management. \n \nC.  Quantification of GEF Contribution \n \n11.  GEF funds the incremental costs of activities required to secure global environmental \nbenefits that would not normally be undertaken as part of national sustainable development \n(SD) intervention. Therefore, GEF involvement is justified for activities aimed at achieving global \nenvironmental objectives (OP#2) over and above national SD costs. \n                                                      \n2  Supplementary Appendix O: Project Contribution to Operational Programs and Key Indicators of GEF Business \n  Plan. ", "38  Appendix 4 \n12.  Global  benefits  from  the  Project  will  be  derived  from  (i)  protection  of  endangered \nspecies, (ii) conservation of ecosystems that are under threat, and (iii) improved watershed \nmanagement and wetlands habitat quality, leading to increased number of wildlife. Replicability \nof  the  project  model  framework  throughout  the  Sanjiang  Plain  will  enhance  the  global \nenvironmental benefits. Quantification of incremental costs in achieving global benefits over and \nabove  national  SD  costs  is  presented  in  Annex  B  of  the  GEF  Executive  Summary \n(Supplementary Appendix D). The key approach in quantifying GEF contribution is summarized \nbelow.  \n13.  Business as Usual (BAU) Baseline.  The BAU baseline assumes continued investment \nby the Government and aid agencies in watershed and water resource management, nature \nconservation, and further expansion of the protected area system. It also assumes continued \n(but modest) investment by the Government in wetland restoration and reforestation, but under \nthe following practices: (i) There will be an established network of wetland NRs and annual \ngovernment allocations of funds to manage them. (ii) NRs would, however, continue to operate \nwithout  management  plans  and  use  approaches  that  have  proved  to  be  less  effective  at \nstemming the decline of globally important species. (iii) Recovery of globally threatened species \nwould not be accelerated unless projects are specially designed for that purpose. (iv) Existing \nprograms would restore some farmlands to wetlands, but compensation payments to displaced \nfarmers would not be designed to yield long-term economic benefits, nor would there be any \nincentives for adopting environment-friendly approaches compatible with wetland protection. \n(v) Water resources would be allocated first to municipalities, then to industry and agriculture; if \na surplus remained, it would be available for NR use. (vi) Commercialized tourism facilities \nwould  be  developed  in  the  experimental  zone  of  NRs  due  to  incorrect  interpretation  of \nregulations, but this would come at a cost in terms of disturbing wetland habitat.  (vii) Lack of \ntraining and education would continue to hamper NR personnel in performing their duties. \n(viii) Communities surrounding NRs would not be aware of the importance of conservation \nmanagement. (ix) Populations of globally threatened species would continue to decline or at \nbest show only marginal recovery. (x) Sufficient funds would not be allocated and trained \npersonnel would not be available to fully protect wetland biodiversity or carry out the mandates \nof the various conservation action plans. The cost of the baseline scenario has been calculated \nat $39,850,000.  \n14.  Sustainable  Development  (SD)  Alternative.  The  SD  alternative  adds  to  the  BAU \nbaseline  investments  by  the  government  (including  the  Asian  Development  Bank  loan)  in \nreforestation,  and  investments  in  economic  development  in  villages  affected  by  both  the \nfarmland-to-forest  and  the  farmland-to-wetland  restoration  programs.  The  investments  will \nimprove environmental management and conditions, but will be mainly of national benefit. \nImplementation  of  the  SD  alternative  over  the  5  years  of  the  Project  is  expected  to  cost \napproximately $79,510,000.   \n15.  GEF Alternative.  The GEF alternative scenario adds to both the BAU baseline and SD \nalternative activities that are designed to achieve the Project\u2019s global biodiversity objectives, and \nthat  are  expected  to  generate  significant  global  benefits.  Implementation  cost  of  the  GEF \nalternative scenario over the 5 years of the Project (July 2005\u2013June 2010) is as follows. \n16.  Incremental Cost of GEF Alternative. The estimated cost of the BAU baseline is \n$39,850,000;  that  of  the  SD  alternative,  $79,510,000;  and  that  of  the  GEF  alternative, \n$90,557,000. The incremental cost is $11,047,000.3 If contingencies ($1,100,000) are included, \nthe amount requested from GEF is $12.14 million.  \n                                                      \n3  $90.5 million minus $79.5 million equals $11.0 million, which is the base cost of the GEF financing portion. Then, \n$90.5 million minus $39.8 million equals $50.7 million, which is the total baseline cost of the Project. \n \n ", "   \n \nPROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN \nTable A5.1: Whole Project Cost Summary \n    CNY Million  $ Million  Foreign  % Total \nExchange  Base   \nComponent  Foreign  Local  Total  Foreign  Local  Total  (%)  Cost \n1.

Scope of Resettlement Impacts \n1.  The  Project  will  finance  wetland  protection  and  forest  plantation  in  projects  in  the \nSanjiang Plain, covering 13 counties1 in 6 prefectures2, and involving 6 nature reserves.3 The \nProject  will  include  four  components:  watershed  management,  wetland  NR  management, \nalternative livelihood program, and education and capacity building. Environmental policies in \nHeilongjiang Province require restoration of ecological conditions, especially in the Sanjiang \nPlain.  Environmental  policies,  in  general,  have  substantial  impacts  on  farming  activities  in \nwetlands, and involve significant cost implications for resettlement compensation. This issue \nhas delayed the Government\u2019s environmental programs for wetland and forest restoration. The \nProject will pilot a livelihood development approach that will ensure income opportunities are \nrestored or improved at lower cost to the Government, and will benefit community relations with \nthe NR management. The success of the approach depends on the participation of affected \npersons  (APs)  and  NRs  in  planning,  and  implementing  viable  and  sustainable  alternative \nlivelihood options. \n2.  The resettlement impacts induced by the Project are mainly associated with the sub-\ncomponent of farmland-to-wetland restoration. Of the total 3,433 hectares (ha) to be converted \nfrom farmland to wetland, about 1,433 ha (1,183 ha in core zones and 250 ha in experimental \nzones) will be in 5 NRs and will affect 820 persons, of whom 186 are State farm workers. Along \nwith land acquisition, 1,950 square meters (m2) of houses owned by the State farm will be \ndemolished. The demolition will necessitate the physical relocation of about 43 households or \n136 individuals who occupy these shelters during the farming season. The other 2,000 ha of \nfarmland in Naolihe NR has already been abandoned, but the wetland still needs to be restored. \nIn  2001,  about  318  workers  from  the  Honqiling  State  farm  were  affected  and  provided \nreplacement farmland in nearby villages. An assessment of the situation found that the state \nfarm has already restored the livelihood schemes and incomes of these people. Under the \nProject, the abandoned land would be restored to wetland, and the State Farm (or villages \naffected) would be eligible for compensation funding for alternative livelihood development. In \n13 counties, 10,800 ha of land will revert to its original legal use as commercial forest, of which \n4,300 ha is currently being farmed by 1,770 forest workers in 28 State forest farms and 447 \nfarmers in 12 villages; these workers are employees of State forest farms and are contracted to \nattend to the lands with salary payments. No minority villages or groups will be affected by the \nProject. However, the subproject resettlement plans (RPs) will verify whether any individual \nethnic minority people will be affected by resettlement. \n \nB.   Legal Framework \n3.  People are strictly prohibited from living in the core zone of wetland NRs. Those who are \npresently farming in the core zone of the wetland NRs will be relocated immediately and all \nproductive activities will stop. Those who live in the buffer zone should move out step by step.4 \nAccording to the Chinese Land Administration Law, land acquisition caused by an infrastructure \nproject will require the developer to pay compensation to the current land owners/users. For this \nProject,  the  impacts  caused  by  ecological  restoration  are  in  accordance  with  the  wetland \nprotection regulation by which land use rights are restricted, and there may be no transfer of \n                                                 \n1  The 13 counties are Baoqing, Boli, Fuyuan, Hegang, Huanan, Hulan, Jixian, Linkou, Luobei, Mishan, Ningan, \n  Qitahe, and Raohe. \n2  The six prefectures are Hegang, Jiamusi, Jixi, Mudanjiang, Qitaihe, and Shuangyashan. \n3  Anbanghe NR, Dajiahe NR, Naolihe NR, Qixinghe NR, Xingkaihu NR, and Zhenbaodao NR. \n4  The Heilongjiang Provincial Wetland Protection Regulation (2003). ", "44    Appendix 8 \nlandownership. The Nature Reserve Protection Regulation of PRC, Article 27 states, \u201cFor those \npeople who live in the core zone of nature reserve, the local government should resettle them \nappropriately.\u201d But there is no detailed regulation of land compensation rates about farmland \nrestoration to wetland. According to the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) Policy on Involuntary \nResettlement, if any project causes individuals or a community to lose all or part of their land, \nhousing, infrastructure, resources, income sources, and services, they will be compensated in \ncash or kind so that their economic and social circumstance will be at least restored to the pre-\nproject level. Thus, all compensation is based on the principle of replacement cost.5 \n4.  For the farmland-to-forest restoration, there is potential for loss of incomes during the \nyears that the trees are growing. The standard practice in the People's Republic of China is to \nprovide an annual subsidy of 100 kilograms of grain and CNY20 in cash to local farmers for \neach mu (1/15 ha) of farmland converted to forestland, for 8 years for natural forest or 5 years \nfor commercial forest.6 This practice is considered costly and welfare oriented, and may not fully \nrestore lost incomes. Therefore, under this Project, a different approach has been taken\u2014the \nProject will finance the planting of nontimber forest products (NTFPs) for people affected by the \nconversion.  They  will  receive  replacement  forestland  and  wages  for  tree  planting,  and \nsimultaneously implement intercropping for 3-5 years on the newly planted forest area at a \nnominal fee of CNY6-7/mu/year (or land contracting fees may be waived). In this manner, the \naffected people will be able to maintain or even increase their income from the land. The project \nwill finance the NTFP for these people at the estimated cost of CNY35.92 million ($4.34 million). \n5.  The Heilongjiang Provincial Government (HPG) will ensure that any resettlement under \nthe Project is carried out in accordance with relevant PRC laws and regulations, ADB's Policy \non Involuntary Resettlement and Handbook on Resettlement, and the resettlement framework \nagreed  upon  by  HPG  and  ADB  (including  the  provisions  on  eligibility  for  compensation, \ncompensation  rates,  rehabilitation  measures,  institutional  arrangements,  resettlement  costs, \nconsultation, disclosure and grievance redress, and monitoring and evaluation). For the six NRs \nwith farmland-to-wetland restoration, RPs with village-level resettlement and development plans \nmust be disclosed to APs, and submitted to ADB for approval before the award of civil works \ncontracts or displacement of farmers. \n \nC.  Eligibility for Compensation \n6.  All APs, regardless of their legal status, will be compensated and rehabilitated. Lack of \nlegal documents of their customary rights or occupancy certificates will not bar them from \nobtaining compensation. The resettlement policy will apply to all components of the Project \nregardless of whether or not they are directly financed by ADB. Particular attention will be paid \nto the needs of vulnerable groups among those affected, especially the poor, the elderly, \nwomen, and children. Based on the principle of replacement cost, the annual income loss from \nland will be the annual net output value. The dry land compensation rate is CNY2,500/mu, and \nthe paddy compensation rate is CNY3,500/mu. The compensation rates for houses will be \nCNY700/m2. \n \nD.  Rehabilitation Measures \n7.  After land acquisition, the affected villages or State farms will readjust the farmland \nwithin the groups, thus ensuring that the APs obtain adequate farmland to replace lost crop \nproduction. Development of alternative livelihood programs will be encouraged as part of the RP \n                                                 \n5  ADB. 2003.

In Xingkaihu State farm, 43 households need to be relocated from the core zone of the \nNR. The affected houses belong to the State Farm, so the house compensation will be paid to \nthe farm directly, and the farm will select the new site outside the NR, rebuild the new houses, \nand  then  allocate  them  to  all  affected  families.  In  addition,  a  transfer  and  transportation \nallowance and cash compensation for loss of other private properties will be provided to each \nhousehold. Xingkaihu State Farm will be responsible for site preparation, electricity connection, \nwater supply, and road construction.  \n \n9.  For those who will be affected by farmland conversion to forestland, landownership will \nnot be transferred. The affected workers or villagers will receive wages for tree planting and \nmaintenance and can share in the profits of forestry. Due to the long period for trees to mature, \nthe APs will be permitted to practice intercropping between the seedlings for 3-5 years. Also, the \nProject will develop at least 860 ha of NTFPs for the APs to ensure incomes will be maintained \nor increased. In addition, villagers can benefit from the subsidy policy (footnote 6) of the central \nGovernment and the provincial governments. \n \nE.  Resettlement Cost and Funding \n10.  About $9.16 million (CNY75.8 million) of the $24.37 million government counterpart fund \nwill be required to pay for resettlement, i.e., compensation, physical resettlement, and village \ndevelopment. HPG will set up an account for the resettlement costs (compensation and village \ndevelopment), which will be managed by the Heilongjiang Province Financial Bureau (HPFB). \nAfter the VDP is approved, HPFB will disburse the fund to the affected village committee or \nState  farm  through  the  County  Financial  Bureau.  The  funds  for  land  compensation  and \nresettlement have been guaranteed by HPG. The proposed funding sources are the Provincial \nWetland Restoration Fund and the central Government fund of the State Farm Bureau.  \n \nF.  Institutional Arrangement for Resettlement \n11.  County-level project implementation units (PIUs) under the Forestry Department will be \nset up and be responsible for supervising RP preparation and implementation. The county land \nadministration bureaus will assist the county management office to implement the RP, and will \nbe responsible for land inventory and acquisition approvals.  \n \nG.  Consultation, Disclosure, and Grievance Redress \n \n12.  Consultation with the APs has taken place in the early process of resettlement planning. \nThe draft RPs have been disclosed to the county and township offices and the affected villages. \nA  resettlement  information  booklet  for  two  draft  RPs  has  been  distributed  to  the  affected \nvillagers.  Further  information  will  be  provided  to  all  APs  before  implementation.  Such \nconsultation and participation will be continued throughout the planning and implementation \nprocess. A formal mechanism for grievances will be established, in addition to standard informal \nprocedures. \n \n \n                                                 \n7  Tentatively, 30% will be utilized for livelihood development. ", "46    Appendix 8 \nH.  Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n13.  Following the requirements of ADB, there will be both internal and external monitoring \nand evaluation of both the farmland-to-wetland, and the farmland-to-forestland programs. The \naim is to ensure that all APs are compensated adequately and timely, and assess whether their \nincomes and livelihood are restored after resettlement and rehabilitation. Each county PIU will \ncarry out internal monitoring and report to the project management office (PMO) and ADB. For \nexternal monitoring and evaluation, the PMO will engage an independent institution such as a \nuniversity or a social research institute. Monitoring and evaluation will cover the progress of \nimplementation,  compliance  with  resettlement  policies,  delivery  of  compensation  funds, \nallocation of replacement land, changes in income and livelihood among APs, consultation, and \nparticipation.  \n \nI.  Procedural Guidance for Resettlement Plan Preparation \n \n14.  For the farmland-to-wetland restoration component, a resettlement framework and two \npreliminary RPs for Xinkaihu NR and Qixinghe NR have been prepared for ADB approval. The \nreason for the resettlement framework is the need for a community-based process to formulate \nalternative livelihood schemes as the basis for resettlement. Further consultation with the APs \nand with the NR PIUs will be carried out to formulate VDPs. This approach will ensure that \nviable and sustainable alternative livelihood schemes are developed to offset lost income from \nfarming, especially activities that are compatible with wetland protection. It will take time to set \nup the PIUs, strengthen the staff of NRs, and prepare VDPs for the affected villages. The six \nsubprojects RPs (two draft RPs and four new RPs) will require further community consultation \nand participation of villagers, local officials, and NR staff to identify and agree on alternative \nlivelihood schemes. VDPs will specify (i) where the compensation funds will be invested, (ii) \nwhat activities will be established under resettlement compensation counterpart, according to \nthe VDP agreed upon, and (iii) how the village collectives and affected farmers will share the \nbenefits from the planned village development activities. The proposed activities should meet \nenvironmental and income-generating criteria. The VDPs should be approved by the PMO of \nHPG and ADB, before the State farm or village committee receives the compensation and \nbefore  displacement  of  farmers  from  the  NRs.  The  Project  will  provide  some  technical \nassistance in formulating VDPs and consultations.  \n \nJ.  Action Plans and Schedule \n \n15.  The project implementation schedule will be refined during the first year of the Project. \nHowever,  resettlement  planning  will  be  carried  out  once  the  Project  is  approved.  The  full \nresettlement framework is in Supplementary Appendix H, including preliminary action plans and \nschedules for farmland-to-wetland restoration.  \n \n ", "Appendix 9   47\nINDICATIVE CONTRACT PACKAGES \n \n \n       \n  Estimated  Packages  Mode of \nItem  Total Cost   (no.)

Introduction \n \n1.  This is an evaluation of the financial and economic benefits and costs of the Sanjiang \nPlain Wetland Protection Project. The Project has five components: (i) watershed management, \n(ii) wetland nature reserve management, (iii) alternative livelihood, (iv) education and capacity \nbuilding,  and  (v)  project  implementation.  Wetland  nature  reserve  management  is  largely \nassociated with global environmental benefits, while subcomponents of watershed management \n(forest improvement) and alternative livelihood (nontimber forest product [NTFP] intercropping) \ncomponents will generate financial and economic analyses are based mainly on the benefits \nand costs associated only with national benefits. The financial cash flows and economic value \nflows were estimated on an incremental basis. \n2.  The proposal is to use 55,600 hectares (ha) of land for forestry improvement\u201411,900 ha \nfor new plantations and 43,700 ha for treatment of existing stands\u2014and 2,380 ha for NTFPs. \nAbout 25% of forestry improvement will involve poplar, and the rest, larch. The plantations will \ncost CNY55 million; treatment, CNY129 million; and NTFPs, CNY35 million. The Project will \nhave a total cost of CNY420 million, excluding contingencies, and a construction period of 5 \nyears (from mid-2005 to mid-2010). The Project will use funds from ADB, Global Environment \nFacility (GEF), and the Government of the People's Republic of China (PRC), as well as labor \ninputs from State forest farm workers. These sources can be categorized into three: debt (ADB \nloan), equity (GEF and labor input), and government funds. GEF and labor input are treated as \nequity because they are assumed to have the same required rate of return. The weighted \naverage cost of capital (WACC)\u2014the weighted sum of estimates of the cost of debt, cost of \ngovernment funds, and cost of equity\u2014is 6.11%. \n \nB.   Least Cost Analysis of Alternatives \n3.  The Project provides a major opportunity to examine the possibility of reducing tree \nplanting density, thereby improving the economic efficiency of forest plantations over current \npractices. Both provincial and county reports were reviewed very thoroughly, and numerous \ndiscussions were held with technical staff of the Heilongjiang Provincial Forestry Department. \nForest plantation practices in Heilongjiang Province are based on traditional standards, which in \nthis particular case involve narrow spacing with one thinning for larch and no thinning for poplar. \nTwo options with varied spacings and tending costs were compared, and the spacing distance \nof 2 meters (m) x 2.5m for larch (2,000 stems/ha) and poplar (1,250 stems/ha) was selected to \nallow wider spacing between trees\u2014and therefore lower plantation and tending costs\u2014with one \nthinning for both larch (at age 12) and poplar (at age 6). The financial and economic analyses \nare based on this option, as it lowered plantation and tending costs and added the opportunity \nfor NTFPs. \n \nC.   Financial Analysis \n4.  Focusing on Revenue-generating Activities. The activities include (i) establishing new \nforest plantations of native species of larch and poplar, (ii) treating of existing forest plantations \nof the same species, and (iii) producing NTFPs. The assumptions in computing the financial \ninternal rate of returns (FIRRs) and net present values (NPVs) and the results of the financial \nanalysis are as follows. The incremental cash flow for the financial analysis includes sales \nrevenue from commercial forestry and NTFP development. Final harvest volume projections per \nhectare are based on a 20-year rotation (with one thinning at age 12) for larch, and a 10-year ", "    Appendix 12  51\nrotation (with one thinning at age 6) for poplar. The Faustmann model1 was used to estimate \noptimal rotation years for poplar and larch, using the WACC as a discount rate for maximum \nNPV with a single rotation during the Project. Net thinning volumes removed are 9 cubic meters \n(m3)/ha for larch and 22 m3/ha for poplar, while final harvest net volume removals are 115 m3/ha \nfor larch and 99 m3/ha for poplar. These volume parameters were applied to both new and \nexisting plantations. New forest plantations and stand treatment operations will take place in all \n13 project counties. It is assumed that most of the total net volume of larch and poplar will be \nold to pulp mills, while some will be sold as mine pit props and as raw material for other wood \nproducts. County reports and additional surveys indicate larch prices of CNY400/m3 at final \nharvest and CNY300/m3 at thinning, and poplar prices of CNY380/m3 at final harvest and \nCNY350/m3 at thinning. \n5.  Estimated Costs and Expenditures for Plantations. Per hectare, cost structures for \nnew forest plantations add up to CNY5,200 for larch and CNY4,600 for poplar, and treatment \ncosts for existing plantations total CNY3,500/ha for both larch and poplar. These cost structures \ninclude overhead costs based on general and administrative expenses directly connected to the \nplantation operations under the proposed project. Additionally, the cost of goods sold includes \nlogging and transportation costs. Logging cost is assumed at CNY170/m3 for larch thinning, and \nCNY140/m3 for felling; and CNY140/m3 for poplar thinning and CNY 110/m3 for poplar felling. \nTransportation cost is assumed at CNY12.5/m3 for both species. Additional financial charges \ninclude a plantation fund surcharge and a sales tax. The plantation fund surcharge is estimated \nat 10% of sales revenue, which is the current effective in the PRC. Sales taxes for timber raw \nmaterial and surcharges are estimated at 5% of sales revenue. Price contingencies and interest \nduring the construction period are excluded from the financial analysis. In treatment of existing \nplantations,  it  is  assumed,  on  the  basis  of  the  with  and  without  principle,  that  untreated \nplantations would have 30% of the harvest value of a healthy plantation on account of much \ndeadwood, small diameters, trees with poor form, and damage from insects and diseases. \n6.  Financial Assumptions for NTFPs. In addition to timber products, three NTFPs (berry \nfruit, wild grape, and potherbs) will be planted in the commercial forestry plantations. While \nforestry operations will take place in all 13 project counties, only those counties with new \nplantations will participate in NTFP production. These are Boli for berry fruit; Huanan for wild \ngrape; and Baoqing, Hulin, Linkou, and Luobei for potherbs. The NTFP yields are projected very \nconservatively in light of spotty information obtained in the field. A price of CNY2/kg for all three \nproducts  was  assumed.  The  cost  of  harvesting  has  been  projected  at  CNY1/kg  and \ntransportation  cost  at  CNY42/metric  ton,  assuming  an  average  distance  to  markets  of  50 \nkilometers NTFP sales are subject to a 7% sales tax on agricultural products. The project life is \nreleased at the end of the Project for commercial forestry and NTFP development. The WACC \nwas calculated as 6.11%, which is used for calculating the financial NPV of the Project. \n7.  Results of Financial Analysis. The overall FIRR of the Project is 14.93%. Detailed \ncalculations are shown in Supplementary Appendix P. The NPV evaluated at the WACC is \nCNY124 million, which is greater than zero. Since the FIRR is higher than the WACC and the \nNPV is positive, the proposed Project is financially viable under the above assumptions. The \nFIRR and NPV by activity and by county were also calculated and the results are shown in \nTable A12.1. An important conclusion from the calculations is that all types of activities included \nare financially viable, and so are the operations programmed for each county. Treating existing \nplantations has a higher FIRR than establishing new ones. The main reasons are that existing \nplantations have the advantage of a sunk cost from their original planting, treatment costs are \n                                                 \n1  The Faustmann analysis shows that larch can reach maximum NPF at 20 years as the optimal rotation year. For \n  poplar, the optimal rotation year is chosen at 20 years from the analysis, since there are not enough historical data \n  to show the maximum output level. ", "52  Appendix 12 \nlower that plantation costs, volume outputs from treatment are assumed to be the same as \nthose from new plantations, and benefits are reaped more quickly from treated plantations than \nfrom new ones. Additionally, the FIRR for treat poplar is higher than that for treating larch, \nmainly because the waiting period with poplar is shorter. This is so even after considering an \nopportunity cost of 30% of harvest value if the stand were left untreated. Among the counties, \nHegang, Jidong, Linkou, and Qitahe show FIRRs slightly in excess of 10%, while Raohe has the \nhighest FIRR, at more than 29%. The first four counties are heavy in larch and new plantations \nand treatment, while Raohe has major areas of poplar treatment. The three NTFPs are also \nshown to be profitable, with FIRRs from 12.2% to 22.78%, based on the current market data \nanalysis. \n8.  FIRRs  and  financial  NPV  sensitivities  were  tested  at  plus  and  minus  10%  for  the \nfollowing variables: (i) wood prices, (ii) wood final harvest volumes, (iii) investment costs, and \n(iv) all costs. The sensitivity analysis for the major components shows that the 10% changes, \nwhen unfavorable, do not reduce the FIRRs below the WACC, neither in the aggregate nor in \nany particular county. While the Project is most sensitive to wood prices, it remains quite robust \nat a 10% change in any of these variables. The sensitivity analysis is summarized in Table \nA12.2. Switching-value analysis was conducted for wood prices, which turned out to be the \nmost sensitive variable in the sensitivity analysis. Even with a drop of 12% in wood prices, the \ncounties with the lowest FIRR could still have a viable operation. \n \nD.   Economic Analysis \n9.  The GEF-supported activities emphasize global environmental values such as protection \nof globally endangered species. Various components of the Project are expected to generate \neither global environmental benefits national environmental benefits, or both. However, the \neconomic evaluation of the Project is conducted from the perspective of national benefits to \nassess its investment rationale.  \n10.  Economic Benefits Related to Forestry and NTFP Investments. The major economic \nbenefits  from  forestry  plantation  are  the  cash  inflow  from  timber  production,  expressed  in \neconomic prices, as well as plantations, new seedlings, and maturing trees providing improved \nsoil cover. Other related benefits include watershed improvement, flood control, protection from \nsoil erosion, and potential production of other NTFPs. Flood control benefits may often be \nestimated on the basis of flood damage avoided or minimized, especially in public and private \ninfrastructure and in industrial and agricultural outputs. In the proposed Project, flood control \nbenefits can take the form of reduction in losses of agricultural output. The proposed plantations \nwill  also  help  the  PRC  reduce  greenhouse  gas  emissions  while  protecting  watershed  and \nwetland biodiversity.2 However, these other benefits are not easily quantified and for this reason \nwere not included in the economic analysis. Economic benefits derived from NTFPs were \nconverted from financial benefits, but valued at prices before tax. \n11.  Economic  Benefits  Related  to  GEF-Supported  Investments.  The  four  other \ncomponents are designed to improve global environmental values through various interventions, \nincluding  those  that  will  produce  marketable  products  as  well  as  secondary  benefits. \nRehydrating the wetlands will recharge the groundwater, moderate stream flows (thus mitigating \nfloods and drought), reverse changes in the microclimate, and protect the water supply, among \nother  benefits.  Recreational  activities  can  include  nature  observation,  bird  watching,  and \ncamping. But biodiversity/and critical habitat benefits, although they could be substantial, are \n                                                 \n2 Like other trees, larch and poplar sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during their natural growth. It has \n  been estimated that forests can sequester more than 0.5 million tons of carbon over their rotation periods. \n  However, the value of sequestered carbon is highly variable since the market for this commodity has not been \n  established, and is therefore not used in this analysis. ", "    Appendix 12  53\nnot easily valued, especially since they are based on non-use values. Hence, only economic \nbenefits related to plantation, treatment, and NTFPs are included in the economic analyses. \n12.  Economic Costs and Other Technical Parameters. Basic costs and prices are the \nsame as those used in the financial analysis. However, all financial values were adjusted to \nreflect economic values. A shadow exchange rate factor of 1.01 was applied to all costs and \nbenefits other than labor. For labor, a shadow wage rate of 0.8 was applied. Taxes (5% sales \ntax on timber, 10% plantation fund surcharge on total timber revenue, and 7% sales tax on \nNTFPs) were excluded from the economic calculations. In the case of economic NPVs, a \ndiscount  rate  of  12%  was  applied.  Incremental  economic  costs  of  the  Project  include \nexpenditures  expressed  in  economic  values  for  forestry  plantations,  but  not  for  the  GEF-\nsupported investment costs and subsequent cash outflows. The analysis was conducted for a \nproject life of 25 years, including the construction period, which is conservative for the types of \nenvironmental benefits. Costs and benefits are expressed in yuan, in constant 2004 prices. \n13.  Opportunity Cost of Land Converted to Forest Plantation. Two types of land are \nacquired to prepare sites for plantations. One is barren land owned by the State forest farms, \nwith an opportunity cost of zero. The second type is land in State forest farm territory but \ncurrently being cultivated for crop production, mainly to provide partial welfare as off-season \nwork to employees, or to retired former employees of the State forest farms. Nevertheless, \ncurrent regulations severely restrict crop production on forestlands. These lands, if cultivated, \nmust revert to forests. The opportunity cost of these lands reverting to forests is lost crop \nproduction. In the Sanjiang Plain the marginal loss of crop production has been estimated at \nCNY938/ha, or RMB63/mu. NTFP production was designed to offset this lost crop revenue for \nthose who previously cultivated the land. Table A12.3, which compares the NPVs of plantation, \nNTFP production, and crop production (per year on average), shows that NTFP is sufficient to \noffset lost crop revenue and that plantation forests have positive NPV. \n \nTable A12.3: NPV Per Hectare for Various Land Use Options (yuan; 12% discount rate) \n \nLand Use Options  NPV/ha \nBarren land  0 \nPlantation  2,078 \nNTFP  8,939 \nTotal Forestry (Plantation + NTFP)  11,017 \nCrop Production  7,406 \n  NPV = net present value, NTFP = nontimber forest product. \n  Source: Asian Development Bank estimate \n       \n14.  EIRR and ENPV Calculations. The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the \nProject as a whole is 24.8%, which is higher than the economic opportunity cost of capital \n(12%). The economic net present value (ENPV) at 12% discount rate is CNY93.03 million, \nwhich is positive. Therefore, the Project is viable from the economic point of view. The EIRR \nand ENPV for different activities and for all the counties are summarized in Table A12.1. \n15.  Sensitivity  Analysis  for  EIRR  and  ENPV.  Sensitivity  analyses  conducted  in  the \neconomic analysis of the same variables as in the financial analysis show that the Project is not \nonly financially but also economically robust. All the counties continue to have economically \nviable operations despite unfavorable changes of up to 10% in the variables considered. (Table \nA12.2). Additionally, switching-value analysis indicates that, to reduce the EIRR to below 12% \nfor the lowest-performing counties (Hegang, Jidong, Linkou, and Qitahe), wood prices would \nhave to drop by more than 15%. \n ", "54  Appendix 12 \n16.  Labor and Impact on Poverty. In addition to the cited economic benefits, the Project \nalso provides farmers with employment opportunities in tree planting, stand treatment, logging, \nand  wood  transport.  Once  the  plantations  are  mature,  there  will  be  further  employment \nopportunities in harvesting, conversion, and use of forest products, especially wood. Assuming \n55,600 ha of forestry operations (both new plantations and treated plantations remain under tree \ncover and labor-intensive methods are used for forestry operations), about 10,000 full-time jobs \ncan be created in planting, treatment, logging, and transport to woodyards (7 months for about \n36,000 forestry workers on larch plantations, and 6 months for about 10,000 forestry workers on \npoplar plantations). \n \nTable A12.1: Summary of FIRR and EIRR by Investment Type and by County \nEconomic NPV \nItem      FIRR (%)  Financial NPV (CNY)  EIRR (%)  (CNY million) \n Plantation     \n     Larch  12.62 \n     Poplar  29.74 \n Treatment   \n     Larch  17.50 \n     Poplar  74.17 \n NTFP   \n     Berry Fruit  35.33 \n     Wild Grape  24.39 \n     Portherb  25.38 \nTotal  24.77 \n   \nCounty   \nBaoqing  36.60 \nBoli  25.82 \nFuyan  38.87 \nHegang  16.15 \nHuanan  27.14 \nHulin  33.06 \nJidong  16.18 \nJixian  24.79 \nLinkou  16.02 \nLuobei  17.24 \nMishan  33.31 \nQitaihe  15.92 \nRaohe  51.39 \nTotal  24.77 \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, FIRR = financial internal rate of return, NPV = net present value, \nNTFP = nontimber forest product. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.\nTable A12.2 Summary of the Results of Sensitivity Analysis \nFinancial Analysis  Economic Analysis  \nItem  FIRR (%)  FNPV (CNY million) EIRR (%)  ENPV (CNY million)\nWood Price -10%  11.34  65.72   21.66  64.80 \nWood Harvest Volume -10%  13.76  103.01   23.69  81.42 \nInvestment Cost +10%  14.02  117.11   23.61  89.11 \nTotal Costs +10%  11.07  70.26  21.16  69.10 \n \nEIRR = economic internal rate of return, ENPV = economic net present value, FIRR = financial economic \ninternal rate of return, FNPV = financial net present value. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates.

Linkages to the Country Poverty Analysis \n       \nIs the sector identified as a national    Yes  Is the sector identified as a national   Yes \npriority in country poverty analysis?      priority in country poverty partnership   \n      No  agreement?      No \n \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the People's Republic of China (PRC): Through \nplantation,  treatment  of  existing  plantations,  development  of  nontimber  forest  products,  many  employment \nopportunities and diversified and more sustainable livelihood opportunities will be available to poor forest workers and \nfarmers, as well as minority groups and women. The development of alternative livelihood schemes will also help the \npoor shift to sustainable use of natural resources while generating income, thus reducing the poor households' wanton \ncultivation of environmentally fragile areas of the Sanjiang Plain. In the medium to long -term, they can also benefit \nfrom the high returns from forest plantations when these reach maturity. With farmland conversion to wetland and the \nestablishment and rejuvenation of natural reserves, the local vulnerable environment will be improved, which in turn \nwill reduce the occurrence of natural disasters such as flooding, and will improve the yield performance of poor \nhouseholds that are producing nontimber products. The proposed Project\u2019s good practices in the development of \nsustainable  livelihood  options,  plantation  of  forest  products,  treatment  of  existing  plantations,  and  sustainable \ndevelopment of nature reserves can serve as models that may be replicated in the PRC\u2019s other environmentally fragile \nareas with a poor population base. \n \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General Intervention \n \nWhat type of poverty analysis is needed?  \nThe national-level official rural poverty lines for Heilongjiang Province are RMB1,300 per capita net annual income for the \npoverty villages and RMB1,000 RMB per capita net annual income for the poverty households (which is comparable to \nthe ADB\u2019s poverty threshold for the country). Of the 13 cities and counties of the Project in the Sanjiang Plain, there are \nthree nationally designated poverty counties (Raohe, Huanan, and Fuyuan). The rural poverty population in these \ncounties is 388,692 persons, accounting for 15% of the total poverty population of the province. Poverty incidence is \n9.7% in Heilongjiang and 9.19% in the directly affected project area. Therefore, there is no severe poverty issue in the \ndirectly affected project areas, and this Project is classified as \u201cgeneral intervention.\u201d \n \nCompared with the average household in the province, poor households in the poverty villages of the project area obtain \ntheir income from farming and have less income from livestock and migrant labor. Many of the poor farmers in the project \narea live in and around the nature reserve (NR). They depend primarily on earnings from the cultivation of land from the \nnature reserve that have been converted to farmland or from work in the state forestry/agricultural farms that are located \nin or adjacent to the NRs. Some of these farmers (referred to as permanent residents) have obtained long-term user \nrights of arable land that have been allocated to them by the village committees. Other farmers (or contract farmers) who \nare not recognized by the local governments as local residents of the area obtained short-term contracts to farmland plots \nowned by state forest and agricultural farms. Aside from these poor farm households, about 10% of the total households \nin the state forest and agriculture farms can be considered poor. The income sources of these poor households are 60% \nfrom farming, 10% from collecting agarics, mushrooms, and wild vegetables gathered from the NR area, 10% from \nforest/agriculture farm salaries, and 20% from other sources such as animal husbandry and fruit trees. Because of the \nvarious national and provincial policies to protect forestry and wetland resources, incomes of forest workers have \ndeclined  through  the  years  as  their  tasks  have  been  limited  largely  to  tending  the  trees  and  to  tree  planting. \nUnderemployment is high, with a typical farm worker providing about 3-4 months of work in a year and earning \nRMB2,500 for that work.   \n \nThough poverty is not extensive, a key cause of income poverty is the limited livelihood opportunities both on-farm and \noff-farm. Where there is work in the state forest/agriculture farms, these are more and more being constrained by public \npolicies that protect and conserve the already fragile and limited forestry and wetland areas of the Sanjiang Plain. With \nlimited skills for other income-earning activities and constraints to credit access, poor farm households and workers tend \nto be averse to changing their farming work, which at present provides them secure and stable income, despite the more \nfrequent occurrence of natural disasters (like drought, waterlogging, flood, early forest, and soil erosion) that adversely \nimpact their farm income. \n \nThe other disadvantaged groups in the project area include women and minority groups. Not only do women perform \nhousehold chores; they are also engaged  in productive activities.  Women contribute 50%, 70%, and 60% of  forest,  ", "56  Appendix 13 \nagarics, and crop production. In crop (mainly rice, corn, and soybeans) production, women take about 60% of the \nworkload in preparing the land planting, weeding, applying fertilizer, and harvesting. In logging operations, women are \nresponsible for cutting limbs, preparing fuelwood, and tending trees. About two thirds of those employed in the paper \nprocessing and other agroprocessing facilities are women. Because of their huge contribution to farming and forestry-\nrelated activities, women often make decisions in their respective households over the sale of most of the products. \nHowever, within the villages and the state forestry/agriculture farm levels, women\u2019s participation in the planning and \ndecision-making process is still limited; they are constrained to borrow funds; and they have limited access to skills-\nenhancing activities.  \nRaohe is the main county with a small group of ethnic minority.  Currently, there is no project component in the vicinity \nof Hezhe minority villages in Raohe. Koreans in the villages of Yongfeng and Dongsheng in Raohe might be affected \nby conversion of 300 ha of farmland to wetlands in the Dajiahe NR if the selected areas are confirmed. Loss of land \nand related income from paddy farming will affect 37 households. The adverse impacts on the two Korean villages can \nbe compensated under the resettlement plans and mitigated under the village development plans to develop \nalternative livelihoods schemes.  \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes     No  \nStakeholder analysis: A stakeholder analysis was conducted during the project preparatory TA (technical assistance) \nand roles of each stakeholder were well-defined. The stakeholders at each level were consulted during the TA: \ngovernment ministries/agencies at the national to local levels, local governments from provincial down to village levels, \nstate-owned and local forest/agriculture farm leaders, workers, women, rural community leaders, the poor farmer \nhouseholds, minorities, and nongovernment organizations. Their expectations and needs were identified, the potential \nproject impacts on them were identified, and the resettlement plans, gender development plans, minority development \nplans, and public participation plans were developed in consultation with the stakeholders.  \n \nIs there a participation strategy?     Yes                   No \nParticipation strategy: To strengthen the project design and enhance the sustainability of the Project, a community-\nbased approach to project planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation will be emphasized during all phases \nof implementation. To enhance the sense of ownership, three community-level project working groups will be set up: \nproject planning working group, project implementation group, and project monitoring group. The groups will play \ndifferent roles throughout the Project. Each group will include community leaders, women, and the poor. The social \nassessment and public participation plan is in Supplementary Appendix G. \n \nD.  Gender Development \n Strategy to maximize impacts on women: \nGender Analysis: Division of labor by gender is evident in the project area\u2014men are more inclined to conduct \noutside activities, operate as migrant labor, and conduct heavy physical activities, while women are more responsible \nand tend to carry out farming and household chores. Women have lower education levels than men and have less \nrepresentation in community affairs. Other features of women are participation and involvements in economic activities \nhave been detailed above. \nGender  and  development  plan:  Project  will  not  have  significant  negative  impacts  on  women,  but  equal \nrepresentations of both gender in development planning and implementation have been strengthened in the project \ndesign, given the fact that local project staff have low gender sensitivities and lack the knowledge and skills for gender \nanalysis and incorporation. The gender development action will facilitate and encourage women\u2019s involvement \nthroughout project implementation, ensure tangible benefits for both female and male community members, and \naddress the gender impact on the proposed activities in the project areas. \nHas an output been prepared?
