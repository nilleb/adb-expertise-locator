An  initial  environmental  examination  (IEE)  was \nAssessment  undertaken. The summary is in Supplementary Appendix H.  \n   \nProject Description  The Domestic Maritime Transport Project (DMTP or the Project) \ncomprises (i) an infrastructure investment component, and (ii) an \ninstitutional development and capacity building component. The \ninfrastructure investment component consists of enhancements to \nthe existing Mal\u00e9 North Harbor through (i) construction of a new \n290 meter (m) long quay, projecting northward at right angles to \nMarine Drive alongside the boundary to Mal\u00e9 Commercial Harbor; \n(ii) ancillary civil works; (iii) provision of cargo handling equipment; \n(iv) construction  of  a  temporary  transit  area  for  goods  and \npassengers;  and  (v)  consulting  services  for  detailed  design, \npreparation  of  tender  documents,  bid  evaluation,  construction \nsupervision, and project management assistance. The institutional \ndevelopment and capacity building component aims at increasing \nthe sustainability of the investment and enhancing ongoing sector \ninitiatives by providing support to (i) current efforts to align the \norganizational  structure  of  the  Ministry  of  Transport  and \nCommunication (MTC) to its sector mandate, in particular focusing \non policy, planning, and regulatory functions of international and \ndomestic maritime transport infrastructure and transport services; \n(ii)  capacity  building  within  MTC  in  the  areas  of:  (a)  strategic \nplanning and policy analysis, (b) establishment of harbor usage \ncharges, (c) maritime safety regulations and vessel inspection and \nregistration procedures, and (d) project performance and impact \nmonitoring;  and  (iii)  capacity  building  within  the  Ministry  of \nConstruction  and  Public  Infrastructure  (MCPI)  to  enable  it  to \nmanage, operate, and maintain maritime transport infrastructure in \nMal\u00e9 in a sustainable manner through (a) harbor management, \nand (b) financial management training.  \n ", "ii   \nRationale  Mal\u00e9 North Harbor is the lifeline access point to the social and \neconomic development opportunities available in the capital for \n70% of the population who live in outer atolls, where the highest \nincidence  of  poverty  occurs.  By  providing  connectivity  to  the \ncapital, Mal\u00e9 North Harbor serves a fundamental social need and \nis the most important interisland transport hub in the Maldives. \nCongestion in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor is chronic. The current situation, \nwhich  constitutes  a  bottleneck  for  the  poorest  population \nsegment\u2019s entry to the capital, is a result of the combined effects \nof lack of capacity and lack of harbor management. Improvements \nto the existing facilities are the highest ranked sector infrastructure \ninvestment  proposal  in  the  Government\u2019s  Seventh  National \nDevelopment  Plan  2006\u20132010  (7NDP).  Construction  of  an \nadditional quay area of 290 m will alleviate congestion for quay \nspace and on the feeder road. The investment will increase the \nsustainability  and  operational  efficiency  of  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor, \ntogether with the institutional development and capacity building \ncomponent which includes support to (i) introduction of harbor \nusage charges, and (ii) harbor management initiatives.  \n   \nImpact and Outcome  Through facilitating access to markets and social services, the \nProject will help ensure redistribution of benefits; and sustained, \nequitable, and regionally balanced economic growth within the \nMaldives. The impact will be attained by improvements to the \ncountry\u2019s main inter-atoll transport hub, supported by institutional \nand capacity building initiatives in the domestic maritime transport \nsector. The expanded capacity of Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will improve \nconnectivity, reduce transport cost, and facilitate interisland trade. \nIt is expected that the enhanced capacity will increase Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbor\u2019s contribution to gross domestic product (GDP) by 0.1% by \n2015. The increase in interisland trade is expected to result in a \n10%  volume  increase  in  key  outputs  of  domestic  agricultural \nproduce sold in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor markets by 2014. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $6.65 million, \nincluding taxes and duties of $0.43 million.  \n   \nFinancing Plan  Table 1: Financing Plan \n($ million) \nSource  Total  % \nAsian Development Bank  5.33  80 \nGovernment  1.32  20 \n      Total  6.65  100 \n  Sources: Feasibility study and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n ", "  iii\n  A loan of $5.33 million equivalent from the Asian Development \nBank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Special Funds resources will be provided. The \nloan will have a 32-year term, including a grace period of 8 years, \nan interest rate of 1.0% during the grace period and 1.5% per \nannum thereafter, and such other terms and conditions set forth in \nthe draft Loan Agreement. The Borrower will be the Republic of \nMaldives. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization  Until 31 December 2009 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2009 \nCompletion Date \n   \nExecuting Agency  Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT) \n   \nImplementation  A project steering committee (PSC) will be established for the \nArrangements  Project, chaired by the Minister of MTC, with representatives at \ndirector  levels  from  MoFT;  MCPI;  Ministry  of  Planning  and \nNational Development (MPND); Ministry of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment  (MHUD);  Ministry  of  Environment,  Energy  and \nWater (MEEW); Mal\u00e9 Municipality; and other relevant agencies as \nnecessary. The PSC will provide overall policy and operational \nadvice and guidance to the Project. The Implementing Agency \n(IA) will be MTC. The project management unit (PMU) will be \nlocated in the IA and will be headed by the executive director of \nplanning and projects in MTC as the project director. The project \ndirector will serve as secretary to the PSC and will appoint the \nheads  of  the  two  project  implementation  units  (PIUs)  to  be \nestablished in MTC and MCPI. The PMU will be staffed with (i) a \nsenior  transport  policy  and  planning  specialist,  (ii)  a  transport \npolicy  and  planning  specialist,  (iii)  a  senior  transport  project \nmanagement specialist, and (iv) a transport project management \nspecialist. The MTC PIU will be headed by a senior transport \npolicy and planning specialist and be staffed with (i) a policy and \nplanning expert, and (ii) a regulatory expert. The MCPI PIU will be \nheaded by a senior engineer and be staffed with (i) a design \napproval  engineer;  (ii)  a  supervision  engineer,  including \nenvironmental coordination; and (iii) a project accountant.  \n   \nProcurement  Goods,  works,  and  related  services  to  be  financed  out  of  the \nproposed loan will be procured according to ADB\u2019s Procurement \nGuidelines (2006, as amended from time to time.) All contracts will \nbe procured through international competitive bidding (ICB). \n   \n ", "iv   \nConsulting Services  DMTP will require 50.5 person-months of international consulting \nservices and 33.0 person-months of national consulting services. \nThe consultants will be engaged by the Government using ADB\u2019s \nquality-  and  cost-based  selection  (QCBS)  method,  based  on \nbiodata  technical  proposals  for  the  infrastructure  investment \nconsulting component, and simplified technical proposals for the \ninstitutional  development  and  capacity  building  component.  All \nconsulting selection will be undertaken in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nGuidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from \ntime to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The  Project  will  minimize  turnaround  time  for  cargo  and \nBeneficiaries  passenger  vessels  and  reduce  cargo  handling  cost,  cargo \ndamage,  and  road  congestion  on  Marine  Drive.  The  direct \nbeneficiaries  will  be  vessel  owners,  passengers,  and  cargo \nowners from outer atolls. The economic internal rate of return is \nestimated at 22.5%. \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Availability  of  skilled  and  experienced  staff  for  project \nimplementation and monitoring is a critical constraint, which has \nbeen  mitigated  through  the  support  of  consultants  and  the \ncapacity  building  activities  included  under  the  infrastructure \ninvestment  consulting  and  the  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building components. \n \n ", "o o\n72  00'E 74  00'E\nMALDIVES\nNORTH THILADHUNMATHI ATOLL\n(Haa Alifu) DOMESTIC MARITIME TRANSPORT PROJECT\nDhidhdhoo Male' North Harbor\nGailandhoo Channel\nNolhivaranfaru PROPOSED MALE' \nSOUTH THILADHUNMATHI ATOLL\nNORTH HARBOUR\n(Haa Dhaalu)\nGovernment Harbor\n6N o O0R0T'NH MAALHU(ROgaSoaMo)MfAoAarDealsiUbfryuu LCsUhha nAineTlOLNSLOORUMTTHaH n MMaFNIIdLaLaAhrAi(ufoDSaDkoHh(rHoNuaUlUovhNioNyuMnaMfuunAA)in)DDaUU6dLLh oU Uo0  AoA0TT'ONOLLLL Male' North West HarborCOMMERCILAighteLrage Berth INTEBMRAAISRSIILNNAE NDDRIVE Male' North East Harbor\nHARBOR\nFAADHIPPOLHU ATOLL\n(Lhaviyani)\nSOUTH MAALHOSMADULU ATOLLEydhafushi RIVE\n(Baa) D\nU \nMAL\u00c9 ATOLL G\nWadu A\nChannel (Kaafu) E M\nE\nRosdhoo N\nA\nH\nARI ATHOLU( N UoTrtHhU ARliUfuG)OFI ATOLL MAL\u00c9 AND\nH\nC\nMahibadhoo MAJEEDHLE DRIVE\nFulidu Channel\nARI ATHOLU DHEKUNBURI ATOLL\nFelidhe\n(South Alifu) Keyodhoo FELIDHE ATOLL\nAriyaddu Channel (Vaavu)\nNORTH NILANDHE ATOLL Wataru Channel\n(Faafu) E\nNilandhooMagoodhoo MULAKU ATOLL RIV\n(Meemu) D\nSOUTH NILANDHE ATOLL Muli SA \nKuda(Dhhuavalau)dhoo Kudahuvadu Channel A LA\nR\nA\nK\nKOLHUMADULU ATOLL\n(Thaa)\nVeymandhoo AMEENEE MAGU DRIVE\nVeimandu ChannHelADHDHUNMATHHIi tAhTaOdhLoLo\n(Laamu)\nOne and Half Degree Channel Male' South West Harbor\nM A L D I V E S\no o\n1  00'N 1  00'N\nVilin'gili\nNORTH HUVADHU ATOLL\n(Gaafu Alifu) Project Area\nThinadhoo\nNational Capital\nSOUTH HUVADHU ATOLL\n(Gaafu Dhaalu) Atoll Capital\nEquatorial Channel N Road\nW a d u     C h a n n e l\nFoamulah Reef Edge\n06-4 ADD(SUHe eiAtnhTuaO)dLhLoo FOAM(GUnLaAvKiyUan Ai)TOLL 0 100 200 300 Boundaries aArteo lnl oAtd nmeicneisstsraatriivlye  aBuothuonrditaartyive.

THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan \nto the Republic of the Maldives for the Domestic Maritime Transport Project1 (DMTP or the \nProject). \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n2.  Maritime transport in the Maldives best compares to that of a road network in land-based \ncountries. Well-developed maritime transport infrastructure and capable sector institutions are \nfundamental  to  sustained  social  and  economic  development  in  the  country.  The  proposed \nProject was included in the country strategy and program update2 and is designed to address \nboth investment and institutional aspects in the sector.3 \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis \n  1.  Introduction \n3.  The Maldives gained independence in 1965 and became a republic in 1968. The country \nconsists of 1,190 coral islands, with a total land area of approximately 250 square kilometers \n(km2), of which more than 80% is less than 1 meter (m) above sea level. The population of \n298,8424 lives on less than 200 inhabited islands. The capital, Mal\u00e9, attracts more than 30% of \nthe population to its almost 2 km2 of land. Population density in Mal\u00e9\u2014more than 52,000 people \nper km2\u2014is one of the highest in the world. \n \n4.  The Maldives has no known mineral resources. The economic base is narrow, as in \nother small island economies, and relies primarily on tourism (33% of gross domestic product \n[GDP] in 2004) and fisheries. As a result of the multiplier effect from the tourism sector, the \ntransport  and  communications  sector  accounted  for  approximately  15%  of  GDP  in  2004. \nDespite the limited resource base and lack of economies of scale, the Maldives had achieved \nimpressive economic growth and social development, with average GDP growth of above 7% \nper annum and a GDP per capita income of above $2,500 prior to the December 2004 tsunami. \nSince then, economic performance has deteriorated. Tsunami-related damage is estimated at \nabout $470 million or about 62% of GDP. In 2005 compared to 2004, tourism arrivals dropped \n36%, and total budget expenditure increased by 40%, whereas total revenues increased by only \n6%. The economy is estimated to have contracted by 5.5% in 2005. Despite recovery in the \ntourism sector, and the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT) estimate of 18% GDP growth \nin  2006,  public  expenditure  levels  and  structural  issues\u2014including  diversification  of  the \neconomy and capacity constraints\u2014need to be addressed to ensure a sustainable return to pre-\ntsunami economic growth rates.  \n \n5.  The geophysical setting of the Maldives creates a critical role for maritime transport in \nensuring  access  to  economic  and  social  development  opportunities.  Large  distances\u2014in \ncombination with slow and uncomfortable maritime transportation, variable demand, lack of \n                                                 \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1 and the status of project readiness is in Supplementary \nAppendix A. \n2 ADB. 2005.

Technical Assistance to the Republic of the Maldives for Preparing \nthe Domestic Maritime Transport Project. Manila (TA 4394-MLD). \n4  Maldives  Population  and  Housing  Census  2006,  Preliminary  Results,  Ministry  of  Planning  and  National \nDevelopment, Mal\u00e9, Maldives, 6 April 2006. \n ", "2   \neconomies of scale, limited economic activity in remote atolls to finance travel needs, and \nadverse seasonal weather conditions\u2014result in high transport cost and limited transportation \nopportunities. While air transport is gradually developing, maritime transport remains the most \nimportant transport mode in the country.  \n \n6.  About 70% of the population lives in outer atolls, where the incidence of poverty is higher \nthan in the capital. Inequalities between Mal\u00e9 and the atolls increased in the period 1997\u20132004.5 \nLack of connectivity is an underlying cause of poverty, remoteness, and isolation in outer atolls; \nand is an impediment to ensuring equitable opportunities and fairer distribution of income and \nwealth, which are key objectives of the Government\u2019s Seventh National Development Plan \n(7NDP).6 \n \n7.  Mal\u00e9 North Harbor is the main hub for interisland transport in the Maldives. It is the \nlifeline to the capital for the outer atoll population who come to Mal\u00e9 to source vital items \nnecessary for the survival of small communities in remote parts of the country. \n \n  2.  Maritime Transport Sector \n8.  The Government\u2019s direct role in the sector has focused on (i) provision of international \nand domestic maritime transport infrastructure; and (ii) regulation of domestic maritime transport \nservices in the areas of safety, vessel inspections, and vessel registrations.  \n \na.  International Maritime Transport Infrastructure \n9.  The limited natural resources base necessitates substantial imports of consumables, \nconstruction materials, manufactured goods, and petroleum products. Until 2006, most of the \ncountry\u2019s  imports  arrived  in  Mal\u00e9  Commercial  Harbor  (MCH),7 which  is  located  on  the \nnorthwestern part of the capital island and operated by Maldives Ports Authority (MPA), a fully \nowned government entity established in 1986. MPA reports to the Ministry of Transport and \nCommunication (MTC) and is responsible for the operation and maintenance (O&M) of all \ncommercial ports in the Maldives, including the two regional ports commissioned in 2006. All \ninternational trade related shipments occur through the commercial ports. MCH, which can \naccommodate ships up to 15,000 gross ton (GT) and has a 10.5 m draft, handled a throughput \nof 416,457 metric tons in 2005 (95% imports and 5% exports). About 40% of total imports are \nre-shipped to outer atolls, and 90% of this domestic interchange occurs via Mal\u00e9 North Harbor. \nMCH currently operates above capacity. The lack of space available on Mal\u00e9, especially for \ncontainer storage and handling, severely constrains future expansion options and a relocation is \nbeing considered.  \n \n10.  To ease the capacity constraints of MCH, and in line with the Government\u2019s national \ndevelopment strategies of creating regional development centers, two regional ports became \noperational in 2006: HD. Kulhuduffushi Regional Port in the Northern Development Region and \n                                                 \n5  Two vulnerability and poverty assessments were conducted in 1997 and 2004. \n6  The 7NDP covers the period 2006\u20132010. It was launched with the first working draft in January 2006. Upon \ncompletion of final consultations with line ministries, the 7NDP will be submitted to Cabinet for approval. In their \ncapacities as heads of line ministries, Cabinet ministers endorse the corresponding sector contents of the 7NDP. \nCabinet approval is expected by end April 2007. \n7  ADB has provided assistance to the development of MCH through two  loans: (i) ADB. 1988.

The regional ports cater \nto commercial import cargo and are designed to specifications that are markedly different from \nthe  vessel  requirements  and  harbor  specifications  of  domestic  maritime  transport. \nHD. Kulhuduffushi Regional Port has a 170 m x -5 m quay which accommodates ships up to \n1,000 GT, whereas S. Hithadhoo Regional Port accommodates ships up to 3,000 GT and has a \ndraft of 8 m.  \n \nb.  Domestic Maritime Transport Infrastructure in Mal\u00e9  \n11.  Mal\u00e9, the national hub island, is rectangular in shape and has harbors on three of its four \nsides (Map 1). The harbors in Mal\u00e9 are used for distinctively different activities. Usage patterns \nare  codified  in  guidelines  issued  by  the  Ministry  of  Construction  and  Public  Infrastructure \n(MCPI).8  \n \n12.  The harbor area relevant to the proposed Project is Mal\u00e9 North Harbor (Map 2), which is \nthe gateway to the capital for the outer atoll population and is reserved for inter-atoll passenger \nand cargo vessels. The harbor currently consists of a quay wall of 200 m along Marine Drive \nfrom the west side of the existing fish market up to the existing boundary wall of MCH. Vessels \nlonger than 20 m berth along the quay and discharge and load item by item using manual labor. \nVessels shorter than 20 m berth bows onto the quay. The harbor has an external seawall and \noffers unused space with potential for quay wall development in protected waters. At present, \nthe  area  has  no  infrastructure  supporting  loading  and  unloading,  and  the  efficiency  of  its \noperations is hindered by lack of harbor management. Harbor management responsibilities for \nharbors located on the northern part of Mal\u00e9 up to Mal\u00e9 North West Harbor primarily rest with \nMCPI with inputs from the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development (MHUD), MTC, and \nMal\u00e9 Municipality. Detailed descriptions of the usage of each of the Mal\u00e9 harbors, as well as the \ninstitutional arrangements for harbor planning, construction, operation, and maintenance are in \nthe sector analysis in Appendix 2. With the exception of MCH, no charges for loading and \nunloading are currently levied for the use of harbors on the northern side of the island. O&M \ncosts are covered through the central budget.  \n \nc.  Maritime Transport Services \n13.  The market structure for domestic maritime transport services consists of a mix of partly \npublic and private operation and ownership. The transport services sector is \u201con-demand\u201d based \nand is characterized by the lack of a system of regular, scheduled transport passenger and \ncargo services\u2014in particular among Mal\u00e9 and outer atolls. Scheduled transport passenger \nservices have primarily been provided by the Maldives Transport and Contracting Company \n(MTCC),9 a  state-owned  enterprise.  The  passenger  and  cargo  transport  services  segment \nserved by individuals or island communities is fragmented and lacks sufficient size to create \neconomies of scale.  \n \nd.  Fleet  \n14.  Traditional vessels operated by individuals or island communities are slow, inefficient, \nand lacking in passenger facilities and safety features. Transit times are long and uncomfortable \nand passenger vessels only carry passengers who cannot afford air travel. Most of the vessels \n                                                 \n8  The most recent guidelines are in effect from 1 September 2006.  \n9  Some 52.5% of the shares in MTCC are held directly by the Government; another 7.5% of MTCC\u2019s shares are held \nby government-controlled companies, resulting in a total government majority of 60%. Further details on MTCC\u2019s \ntransport services activities are in Appendix 2. \n  ", "4   \n(known as dhonis) in use for interisland passenger and cargo transport are wooden boats built \nby hand in the islands without design work. Medium-sized dhonis (12\u201325 m long) have an \ninboard diesel engine of 80\u2013300 horsepower (hp), and a carrying capacity of 10\u201350 ton and/or \n35\u2013175 passengers. Larger dhonis (26\u201335 m long) have an inboard diesel engine of 250\u2013\n600 hp, and a carrying capacity of 55\u2013200 ton and/or 135\u2013225 passengers. The past usage of \ncombined passenger and cargo vessels is undergoing a change toward separation of vessel \nuse for passengers and cargo, combined with an increase in the use of larger cargo vessels. \nFiberglass is gradually replacing wood in vessel construction. The vessel registration system \noperated and maintained by MTC underwent comprehensive reform in 2002, and was finalized \na few months before the December 2004 tsunami. The total number of vessels registered has \nsince recovered and reached 90% of the pre-tsunami figures in December 2006. \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n  1.  Challenges \n15.  Mal\u00e9 North Harbor is the lifeline access point to the social and economic development \nopportunities available in the capital for 70% of the population who live in outer atolls, where the \nhighest incidence of poverty occurs. By providing connectivity to the capital for the outer atoll \npopulation, Mal\u00e9 North Harbor serves a fundamental social need and is the most important \ninterisland transport hub in the Maldives. Despite the potential relocation of MCH and the \ncommissioning of the two regional ports in 2006, Mal\u00e9\u2019s current status as the center of imports \nand related interisland commerce\u2014based on the \u201chub and spoke\u201d system, with the hub in Mal\u00e9 \nand the spokes radiating out from Mal\u00e9\u2014is likely to be retained for the expected operational \nperiod of the proposed Project. 90% of imports for consumption by the outer atoll population is \nredistributed through Mal\u00e9 North Harbor; and 90% of cargo in the form of dried fish, agricultural \nproducts,  and  local  handicrafts  from  outer  atolls  to  Mal\u00e9  for  either  export  or  sale  and/or \nredistribution in Mal\u00e9 also occurs through Mal\u00e9 North Harbor.  \n   \n16.  Congestion in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor is chronic. The current situation, which constitutes a \nbottleneck for the outer atoll population\u2019s entry to the capital, is a result of the combined effects \nof lack of capacity and harbor management. The lack of capacity results in multilayer berthing. \nLarger vessels, which are not designed for front or stern loading and unloading, frequently moor \nin  four  to  five  layers  and  initiate  unloading  and  loading  activities  across  adjacent  boats. \nConsiderable time savings, which are assumed to translate into increased passenger and cargo \nvessel calls at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, could be achieved if these vessels were able to moor directly \nalongside the quay. Congestion also arises because of lack of harbor management. Vessels are \ntraditionally converted into commercial and storage facilities rather than means of transport \nduring the period spent in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor. It is common practice that outer atoll vessels wait \nin Mal\u00e9 North Harbor until sufficient cargo and passengers have been ensured to justify a \nprofitable return trip. This practice results in extended waiting time, severe congestion, and \nsignificant losses to vessel owners. Combined with inadequate institutional frameworks, the \nabove factors impede access to the social and economic development opportunities offered in \nMal\u00e9, and increase transport cost. Existing congestion in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will be exacerbated \nby projected growth in demand for both cargo and passenger interisland transport services.  \n \n17.  Multiple ministries and agencies are involved in sector decisions. The main ministries \nare MTC and MCPI. MTC has primary responsibility for international and domestic maritime \ntransport infrastructure and services, including formulation of transport policies and regulation, \nestablishment of safety standards, and conducting surveys and registration of vessels. Apart \nfrom MPA\u2019s activities, MTC\u2019s sector involvement has focused on policy and regulatory aspects \n \n ", "  5\nof  domestic  maritime  transport  services.  MCPI  is  the  primary  ministry  responsible  for \nconstruction of infrastructure in the Maldives. MCPI\u2019s Public Works Services (PWS) Section is \nresponsible for the O&M of domestic harbors within Mal\u00e9. PWS also sets and collects harbor \nusage charges in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor. Organizational diagrams of MTC and MCPI are in \nSupplementary Appendixes B and C. To achieve the long-term objective of ensuring an efficient \nsector structure through separation of policy, planning, and regulatory functions from operational \nactivities,  there  is  a  need  for  organizational  realignment  and  clarification  of  roles  and \nresponsibilities among government agencies. \n \n  2.  Opportunities \n18.  Capacity enhancements to Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will increase connectivity to Mal\u00e9 for the \nouter atoll population and enhance their opportunities for participation in economic and social \nactivities. In combination with the introduction of enhanced harbor management and supporting \ninstitutional frameworks, capacity in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will be expanded through the investment \ncomponent of the proposed Project by provision of (i) additional berthing space to eliminate \nwaiting time; (ii) improved cargo handling; (iii) increased basin depth, allowing entry of larger \nvessels; (iv) a transit area for passengers and goods; and (v) an  off-road area for cargo \naccumulation and transfer from trucks to vessels. Expanded harbor capacity will (i) reduce \ntransport costs, (ii) directly benefit transport operators and producers of products in outer atolls \nfor sale and/or redistribution in Mal\u00e9, and (iii) ultimately benefit consumers through increased \ninterisland trade. Reduced congestion in Marine Drive will benefit all road users. \n \n19.  The introduction of harbor usage charges for Mal\u00e9 North Harbor and Vilin\u2019gili Harbor \nsupported under the DMTP, in addition to the existing charges in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor, will \nfacilitate self-sustaining operations and will act as an incentive to ensure efficient usage across \nharbors.  \n \n20.  The Government fully recognizes that provision of transport infrastructure will not in itself \nensure  a  socially  responsible  and  sustainable  sector;  and  that  policy,  institutional,  and \nregulatory frameworks can assist in achieving these goals. Initiatives are ongoing to realign the \norganizational structure of MTC to its sector mandate. These efforts need to be supported. A \nrealignment carried out on the basis of the agreed sector focus areas (Appendix 3) will assist in \nimproving  development  of  sector  policies,  integrating  planning  activities,  and  increasing \ncoordination among sector agencies. Simultaneous provision of capacity building assistance for \nthe development of strategic planning, policy, and key sector regulatory skills\u2014in the areas of \nestablishment of harbor usage charges across Mal\u00e9 and improved maritime safety regulations\u2014\nwill enhance MTC\u2019s organizational performance. Because of its increased responsibilities for \nO&M of maritime transport infrastructure assets provided under DMTP, MCPI\u2019s capacity needs \nto be enhanced in the areas of harbor management, financial management training, and project \nmanagement training. \n \n  3.  External Assistance to the Sector \n21.  Japan has provided substantial bilateral assistance to construction of breakwaters and \nseawalls  around  Mal\u00e9.  The  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  has  provided  assistance  to \ndomestic maritime transport infrastructure and transport services, and for development of a \ntransport  master  plan  (paras.  22\u201323).  The  Kuwait  Fund  for  Arab  Economic  Development \n(KFAED)  has  supported  the  development  of  commercial  ports  through  assistance  to  the \nestablishment of the two regional ports in HD. Kulhuduffushi and in S. Hithadhoo. The World \nBank is currently providing assistance though the Public\u2013Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility \n  ", "6   \n(PPIAF) to explore options for a relocation of MCH on a public\u2013private partnership basis. \nAssistance  for  rehabilitation  of  maritime  transport  infrastructure  damaged  during  the \nDecember 2004  tsunami  has  been  provided,  in  particular  through  the  Japan  Bank  for \nInternational Cooperation (JBIC) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). A \nsummary of external assistance to the maritime transport sector is in Appendix 4. \n \n  4.  Lessons  \n22.  ADB  has  provided  assistance  to  the  transport  sector  through  four  loans.10 The \nInterisland  Transport  Project,11 approved  in  1981,  aimed  at  introducing  a  reliable  publicly \noperated transportation service between Mal\u00e9 and atoll islands to improve the efficiency and \nsafety of interisland transport. The Project was rated \u201cunsuccessful\u201d12 because of a number of \nreasons, including: (i) lack of a regional development plan and interisland transport statistics; \n(ii) inadequate assessment of the informal sector; (iii) lack of outer island harbor infrastructure; \nand (iv) low cargo collections in addition to overpowered vessel engines, which resulted in \nunsustainable operating costs. Development of MCH has been supported through two ADB \nloans: Mal\u00e9 Port Development Project,13 approved in 1988; and Second Mal\u00e9 Port Project,14 \napproved in 1993. Both loans included investment components to relieve the congestion at \nMCH through infrastructure enhancements and institutional support to MPA. The fourth loan to \nthe  transport  sector,  the  Multi-Project  Loan,15 approved  in  1984,  included  infrastructure \ninvestments to support deepening of priority island harbors.  \n \n23.  In 2002, ADB provided technical assistance (TA) for a Transport Master Plan,16 whose \nobjectives  included  development  of  transport  policies,  strategies,  regulatory  framework, \ninvestment programs, and activities necessary for ensuring a nationwide integrated transport \nnetwork.  The  December  2004  tsunami  led  to  an  urgent  reconsideration  of  nationwide \ninfrastructure investment priorities. The draft final report submitted under the TA was found to \ncontain useful input for future transport planning activities, and to have assisted in creating \ncapacity necessary for the future preparation of master plans.17  \n \n24.  Lessons from ADB involvement in the transport sector illustrate that past assistance for \nphysical infrastructure investments, supported by institutional capacity enhancement measures, \nhas been successful. The project-specific approach applied in the Mal\u00e9 Port Development \nProject, Second Mal\u00e9 Port Project, and Multi-Project Loan\u2014focusing the project scope on a \nvery well defined area of activity supported by advisory services for both design and institutional \ndevelopment purposes\u2014has worked well. These lessons have been incorporated in the design \nof the proposed Project.  \n \n                                                 \n10  In addition, the Tsunami Emergency Assistance Project included a transport component of $2.90 million for the \nreconstruction of harbor infrastructure.  \n11  ADB. 1981.

The study was submitted to ADB in April 2006.  \n \n ", "  7\n  5.  Government Strategy \n25.  The  Government\u2019s  7NDP  outlines  a  development  path  based  on  economic  growth, \nsocial equity, poverty reduction, environmental protection, and good governance. It provides a \npolicy framework for realizing the long-term goals of the President\u2019s Vision 2020.18 The plan, \nwhich is a continuation of the strategies and lessons from the implementation of the Sixth \nNational Development Plan (6NDP), focuses on the creation of equitable opportunities and \nfairer distribution of income and wealth.  \n \n26.  Recognizing the paramount importance of the maritime transport sector in ensuring \npopulation-wide access to social and economic development opportunities, the 7NDP includes \n12 policies with supporting sub-strategies in the form of a combined land and sea transport road \nmap.  Considering  the  lifeline  characteristics  of  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor,  the  highest  prioritized \ninvestment proposal in the land and sea transport road map is improvement through provision of \nloading and unloading areas and new berthing facilities in this harbor. The road map also \nincludes  (i)  institutional  changes  to  improve  the  overall management  and  efficiency  of  the \ntransport sector, including strengthening MTC\u2019s maritime transport functions; (ii) harmonization \nof harbor charges in Mal\u00e9; (iii) development of the sector\u2019s human resources base through \ncapacity building; (iv) improvement of safety measures, including marine navigation aids; and \n(v) enhancing harbor management capacity in Mal\u00e9.  \n \n  6.  ADB Strategy \n27.  ADB shares the Government\u2019s view of the importance of Mal\u00e9 North Harbor within the \ncountry\u2019s socioeconomic context. Therefore, assistance to improve the country\u2019s main inter-atoll \ntransport hub constitutes the core investment of the proposed Project, which was included in the \ncountry strategy and program update.19 ADB supports the Government\u2019s policy of maintaining \nownership and operation of domestic maritime transport infrastructure in the short to medium \nterm. ADB further supports the Government\u2019s long-term sector objectives of ensuring separation \nof maritime transport sector policy, planning, and regulatory functions from operational activities; \nthe ongoing realignment initiatives in MTC; and the strategic directions outlined in the 7NDP to \nintroduce efficiency and sustainability targets to enhance public sector provision of domestic \nmaritime transport infrastructure. These sector objectives are supported under the loan through \nthe institutional development and capacity building component.  \n28.  Lack of access to finance has been identified as a major obstacle for increased private \nsector participation in the domestic maritime transport services sector. In line with the policy \ndirection outlined in the 7NDP\u2014to strengthen the role of the private sector in the provision of \ntransport services\u2014ADB is currently exploring options for inclusion of financial assistance to \nprivate vessel owners under the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Development Project.20 In \naddition, ADB\u2019s Private Sector Operations Department is exploring options for providing a loan \nto the Maldives Finance Leasing Company Pvt. Ltd., which offers leasing facilities to private \nvessel owners against security, as part of a proposed loan to the South Asia SME Leasing \nFacility.  \n \n                                                 \n18  Vision 2020 was outlined by the President in his Independence Day address on 26 July 1999. \n19  Footnote 2. \n20 ADB. 2005.

Impact and Outcome \n29.  DMTP will help ensure sustained equitable and regionally balanced economic growth by \nproviding enhanced access to markets and social services for the outer atoll population. The \nimpact will be attained by enabling improvements to the country\u2019s main inter-atoll transport hub, \nincluded as the highest ranked land and sea infrastructure investment priority in the 7NDP, \nsupported by institutional and capacity building initiatives in the domestic maritime transport \nsector. The expanded capacity of Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will improve connectivity, reduce transport \ncost, and facilitate interisland trade. It is expected that the expanded capacity will increase Mal\u00e9 \nNorth Harbor\u2019s contribution to GDP by 0.1% by 2015. The increase in interisland trade is \nexpected to result in a 10% volume increase in key outputs of domestic agricultural produce \nsold in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor markets by 2014. The improved services of Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will \nreduce congestion and increase the amount of larger vessels calling. The total time spent in \nMal\u00e9 North Harbor by small vessels is expected to be reduced from an average of 10 days to \n8 days by early 2014, i.e., after 5 years of operation. The total time spent by larger vessels is \nexpected to decrease from an average of 15 days to 13 days by early 2014. Average traffic flow \nthrough (defined by the number of vehicles passing through a given point) on Marine Drive \nalong Mal\u00e9 North Harbor is expected to increase by 25% by 2014 because of additional drive-on \naccess  and  cargo  handling  quay  surface  constructed  under  the  Project.  To  ensure \nsustainability, and in line with the Government\u2019s policy directions, the institutional development \nand capacity building component will result in (i) an action plan for institutional alignment of \nMTC\u2019s maritime transport activities in line with its sector mandate; (ii) an action plan for the \nintroduction of harbor usage charges; (iii) an action plan for recommended changes to maritime \nsafety regulations, vessel inspections, and registration procedures; and (iv) an action plan for \nimprovements to financial management systems.  \n \nB.  Outputs \n30.  The Project will enhance the capacity of Mal\u00e9 North Harbor through construction of \nadditional quay wall, provision of cargo handling equipment, and construction of a temporary \ntransit area for goods and passengers. The institutional capacity of MTC and MCPI will be \nstrengthened through the inputs provided under the infrastructure investment consulting, and \nthe institutional development and capacity building components. Capacity building within MTC \nwill focus on the areas of (i) strategic planning and policy analysis, (ii) establishment of harbor \nusage  charges,  (iii)  maritime  safety  regulations  and  vessel  inspection  and  registration \nprocedures, and (iv) project performance and impact monitoring. Capacity building within MCPI \nwill  focus  on  enhancing  its  ability  to  manage,  operate,  and  maintain  maritime  transport \ninfrastructure in Mal\u00e9 in a sustainable manner through (i) harbor management, and (ii) financial \nmanagement training. \n \n  1.  Infrastructure Investment Component \n31.  The civil works component of the Project consists of the construction of a 290 m L-\nshaped quay. The main part of the quay, projecting northwards at right angles to Marine Drive \n(Bodu Thakurufaanu Magu), will be 140 m long and 30 m wide. The eastward leg of the quay, \nplaced along and inside the existing breakwater, will be 150 m long and 11 m wide (Map 2 and \nSupplementary Appendix D). The quay wall will provide additional space for vessels to moor \nand undertake unloading and loading activities, while the quay surface will provide 6,600 square \nmeters (m2) of additional drive-on access and cargo handling. A covered shelter of 480 m2 to \n \n ", "  9\nprotect passengers and cargo in transit will also be provided. The quay wall depth will be -4.0 m \nto cater to the anticipated increase in the use of larger vessels. When operations begin on the \nnew quay, loading and unloading of cargo at the existing 200 m quay wall along Marine Drive \nwill be restricted in order to reduce vehicle congestion.  \n \n32.  The proposed harbor quay walls are comprised of sheet piling and reinforced concrete \ncapping  beams,  finished  with  precast  interlocking  concrete  paving  blocks.  This  quay  wall \nconstruction method has been used successfully with minimum maintenance costs in both MCH \nand Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor. The method is assessed to suit the unique environment of these \nharbors  and  would  also  be  suitable  for  the  proposed  Project  in  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor.  The \nstructural stability of the quay walls are maintained by an anchoring system. The Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbor  structure  will  be  further  studied  and  designed  in  detail  under  the  infrastructure \ninvestment consulting component in accordance with the standards and regulations of MCPI; \nMal\u00e9 Municipality; Ministry of Environment, Energy and Water (MEEW); Maldives Housing and \nUrban Development Board; and all relevant stakeholders. The level of the quay area will be \nmaintained in line with Marine Drive. A comprehensive land use plan will be completed during \nthe detailed design to ensure optimum use of the quay area and ensure accessibility to the main \nroad.  The  land  use  plan  will  include  loading  and  unloading  zones,  and  pedestrian  zones \nensuring the safety of passengers using interisland ferries. The detailed harbor design also \nincludes usage of cranes, transit shelters for cargo and passengers, pedestrian and vehicular \ncontrol arrangements with gates, fencing, and guard post. The quay will be equipped with \nmooring bollards and fenders to protect both quay walls and vessels. Adequate elevated lighting \nwill be provided to allow for 24-hour operation, as in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor. \n \n  2.  Institutional Development and Capacity Building Component \n33.  The Government has requested that institutional development and capacity building \nsupport be provided under the DMTP to support the gradual implementation of the long-term \nsector  objectives  of  ensuring  separation  of  maritime  transport  sector  policy,  planning,  and \nregulatory functions from operational activities. To support MTC\u2019s sector responsibilities and \nensure the sustainability of the investment, the institutional development and capacity building \ncomponent includes assistance to (i) enhance current efforts to align MTC\u2019s organizational \nstructure  to  its  sector  mandate,  particularly  focusing  on  policy,  planning,  and  regulatory \nfunctions of international and domestic maritime transport infrastructure and domestic maritime \ntransport services; and (ii) capacity building within MTC in the areas of: (a) strategic planning \nand policy analysis, (b) establishment of harbor usage charges, (c) maritime safety regulations \nand vessel inspection and registration procedures, and (d) project performance and impact \nmonitoring. \n \n34.  In the short to medium term, operational responsibilities for domestic maritime transport \ninfrastructure are to remain with MCPI, according to the Government\u2019s strategy. Assistance to \nenhance MCPI\u2019s harbor management capacity is included under the institutional development \nand capacity building component as follows: capacity building within MCPI to enable it to \nmanage,  operate,  and  maintain  maritime  transport  infrastructure  in  Mal\u00e9  in  a  sustainable \nmanner through (i) harbor management, and (ii) financial management training.  \n \nC.  Special Features \n35.  DMTP combines core social dimensions with sustainability through the introduction of \nharbor usage charges for Mal\u00e9 North Harbor and Vilin\u2019gili Harbor, at levels that will ensure full \nrecovery of O&M costs within 4 years after project completion. The development of harbor \n  ", "10   \nusage charges\u2014under a transparent and formal process delineating regulatory functions from \noperational activities, in combination with enhanced harbor management practices as proposed \nunder  the  Project\u2014is  expected  to  increase  effective  utilization  of  maritime  transport \ninfrastructure  in  the  capital.  Anchoring  these  project  elements  within  institutional  capacity \nbuilding support forms an integrated sector approach to solve the congestion of Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbor  in  a  holistic  manner;  ensure  timely  project  implementation,  enhance  long-term \ninstitutional and human resources sector capabilities and guarantee asset preservation. \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n36.  The Project\u2019s total investment costs are estimated at $6.65 million, including taxes and \nduties. The summary investment plan is in Table 1 and detailed cost estimates are in Appendix \n5. \nTable 1: Project Investment Plan \n($ million) \nItem    Amounts \nA.

The PSC will provide overall policy and operational advice and \nguidance to the Project. The PSC will meet as often as necessary, but at least quarterly, and will \nhold its first meeting within 3 months of loan effectiveness. The Implementing Agency (IA) will \nbe MTC. The project management unit (PMU) will be located in the IA and will be headed by the \nexecutive director of planning and projects in MTC as project director. The project director will \nserve as secretary to the PSC and will appoint the heads of the two project implementation units \n(PIUs) to be established in MTC and MCPI. The PMU will be staffed with (i) a senior transport \npolicy  and  planning  specialist,  (ii)  a  transport  policy  and  planning  specialist,  (iii)  a  senior \ntransport project management specialist, and (iv) a transport project management specialist. \nThe MTC PIU will be headed by a senior transport policy and planning specialist; it will be \nstaffed with (i) a policy and planning expert, and (ii) a regulatory expert. The MCPI PIU will be \nheaded  by  a  senior  engineer  and  be  staffed  with  (i)  a  design  approval  engineer;  (ii)  a \nsupervision engineer, including environmental coordination; and (iii) a project accountant. The \nstaffing arrangements for the PMU and PIUs will be in place at the latest within 1 month \nfollowing loan effectiveness. The implementation arrangements are in Appendix 6. MTC has \nimplemented  foreign-aided  capital  projects  in  the  past.  With  support  provided  under  the \ninstitutional  development  and  capacity  building  component,  MTC  is  assessed  to  have  the \ncapacity to efficiently administer the loan and implement the Project. MCPI is responsible for \nconstruction of all infrastructure facilities in the Maldives and has substantial experience in this \nfield. To facilitate compliance with ADB\u2019s procurement and project management requirements, \ncapacity  building  in  these  areas  is  included  in  the  infrastructure  investment  consulting \ncomponent.  \n \n  2.  Implementation Period \n39.  DMTP will be implemented over 24 months, including pre-construction activities. The \nscheduled completion date for the Project is 30 June 2009. The proposed implementation \nschedule is in Appendix 7. \n \n  3.  Procurement \n40.  The MCPI PIU head will be responsible for all procurement activities. All contracts will be \nprocured in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines (2006, as amended from time to \ntime). The Project includes one civil works contract of $3.89 million covering all harbor and land \nworks, as well as cargo handling facilities, which will be procured through single stage: one \nenvelope international competitive bidding (ICB) without prequalification procedures, with prior \nreview by ADB. Bidders will be given 6 weeks for preparation and submission of bids. Indicative \ncontract packages for the Project, including consulting services, are in the procurement plan in \nAppendix 8.  \n \n  ", "12   \n  4.  Consulting Services \n41.  International and national consultants, to be engaged by the Government, will assist \nMTC and MCPI in implementing the Project. All international and national consultants will be \nengaged in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended \nfrom time to time). Consultant services will be required for both the infrastructure investment \nand  the  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  components.  For  the  infrastructure \ninvestment consulting component, which includes environmental monitoring, consulting services \nwill be provided for (i) detailed design, (ii) preparation of tender documents, (iii) bid evaluation \nsupport, (iv) construction site supervision, and (v) project management assistance. Two groups \nof international and national consultants\u2014the design and supervision group, and the project \nmanagement assistance group\u2014will be engaged by the Government through a firm over 21 \nmonths in one contract package of 25 person-months international and 15 person-months \nnational input. MCPI PIU will ensure the availability of office space within MCPI offices prior to \nthe mobilization of consultants. Outline terms of reference for the infrastructure investment \nconsulting component, which will be selected on the basis of quality and cost-based selection \n(QCBS) based on biodata technical proposals, are in Appendix 9.  \n \n42.  For  the  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  component,  a  team  of \ninternational  and  national  consultants  will  be  engaged  through  a  firm,  intermittently  over \n21 months for 25.5 person-months of international input and 18 person-months of national input. \nThe consultant firm will be selected through QCBS, based on simplified technical proposals. \nMTC PIU will ensure the availability of office space within MTC offices prior to mobilization of \nthe  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for  the  institutional  development  and  capacity \nbuilding component are in Appendix 10. The Government requested ADB\u2019s assistance in the \nadvance  actions  necessary  to  facilitate  recruitment  of  consultants  immediately  after  loan \neffectiveness. The Government has been informed that ADB\u2019s support of advance contracting \ndoes not commit ADB to approve the loan for the Project or to finance the recruitment costs.  \n \n  5.  Anticorruption Policy and Measures to Enhance Governance \n43.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  Government  and  EA.  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good  governance, \naccountability and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. \nTo support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included in the \nloan regulations and the bidding documents for the Project. In particular, all contracts financed \nby ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions specifying the right of ADB to \naudit and examine the records and accounts of the EA, the IA, and the PIUs and all contractors, \nsuppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \n \n44.  The Project will introduce additional specific measures to enhance governance and \nprevent  corruption.  Such  measures  include, but  are  not  limited  to  (i)  continued  consultant \nsupport to MCPI PIU staff on procurement and project management; (ii) harbor management \ntraining  for  MCPI  PIU  staff,  including  training  in  collection  of  harbor  usage  charges;  and \n(iii) improving  financial management  systems  and  practices.  Specific  measures  to  increase \ntransparency under the Project include random and independent spot checks by ADB review \nmissions on procurement and financial project accounts. The Government will ensure that \n \n ", "  13\nprocurement of all civil works necessary for the Project will be undertaken by the Government \nthrough the Tender Evaluation Board.21  \n \n  6.  Disbursement Arrangements \n45.  Loan disbursements will be in accordance with ADB\u2019s Loan Disbursement Handbook, \n(2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time),  and  detailed  arrangements  agreed  between  the \nGovernment and ADB. For both works and consulting services, loan funds will be disbursed \nusing ADB\u2019s direct payment procedures. \n \n  7.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n46.  The PMU and PIUs will each maintain separate project records and accounts adequate \nto identify goods and services financed from loan proceeds, financing resources received, \nexpenditures incurred, and use of local funds. All project accounting systems will be set up in \naccordance with sound accounting principles and practices in line with national or international \nstandards. Annual project accounts and related financial statements, consolidated at the PMU \nlevel, will be subject to an annual external audit by auditors acceptable to ADB. The annual \naudit report will include an opinion on use of loan proceeds, compliance with covenants, and \ndiscrepancies in accounting records or policies, if any. The EA will monitor project accounting \nsystems and reports at the PMU and PIUs, and will provide ADB with the annual audited \nfinancial statements and project accounts, audit reports, and management letters in English no \nlater than 6 months after the end of each fiscal year during project implementation. The EA, in \nconjunction with the PMU, will also provide quarterly project progress reports in accordance with \nthe project performance monitoring system (PPMS) framework.  \n \n  8.  Result-Based Strategic Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n47.  The design and monitoring framework indicators and PPMS have been discussed and \nthe Government agrees that indicators of project impact should relate to volume increase in key \noutputs of domestic agricultural produce sold in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor markets. The relevance and \npracticability  of  indicator  data  collection  has  been  confirmed  by  the  Government.  MTC, \nsupported by the consultants engaged under subcomponent 2 of the institutional development \nand capacity building component, will develop a comprehensive PPMS framework to monitor \nactivities, analyze and consolidate the data, and provide quarterly PPMS monitoring reports for \nsubmission to ADB until project completion. The PPMS framework will include the requirements \nfor ADB project progress reports as well as data for socioeconomic and environmental impact \nindicators22 to measure project impacts at the beginning of project implementation and allow for \nquarterly  reporting  on  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP).  The \nPPMS framework will be refined to confirm achievable targets, monitoring arrangements, and \nwill be finalized no later than 6 months after project inception, i.e., by mid-December 2007. After \nproject completion, evaluation surveys will be conducted annually and submitted to ADB for \n5 years after project completion. The project completion report will be prepared within 3 months \nafter the physical completion of the Project. The report will include a detailed evaluation of the \nProject  covering  the  design,  costs,  contractors  and  consultant\u2019s  performance,  social  and \neconomic impact, economic rate of return, and other details relating to the Project as may be \nrequested by ADB. \n                                                 \n21  The Maldives has a centralized procurement system for all goods and services across all sectors through its \nTender  Evaluation  Board  established  under  MoFT.  The  Tender  Evaluation  Board  has  experience  with \nimplementation of projects funded by international development institutions. \n22 Environmental quality indicators have been identified in the initial environmental examination (IEE).   \n  ", "14   \n \n  9.  Project Review \n48.  A project inception mission will be fielded soon after loan effectiveness. Thereafter, \nregular reviews will be conducted annually or more frequently as required for effective project \nimplementation. In June 2008, a midterm review by the Government and ADB will consider the \nProject\u2019s progress and agree on any changes in scope or implementation required to achieve \nthe Project\u2019s intended impact. The EA and IA will monitor project implementation and keep ADB \ninformed of any significant deviations that may result in the schedule not being met. \n \nIV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \nA.  Benefits \n49.  The DMTP will support the domestic maritime transport sector by (i) relieving congestion \nin  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor,  the  most  important  interisland  transport  hub  in  the  country;  and \n(ii) supporting  long-term  sector  objectives  of  separating  policy,  planning,  and  regulatory \nfunctions from operational responsibilities through the institutional development and capacity \nbuilding component. The Project will assist in ensuring increased opportunities for 70% of the \npopulation residing in outer atolls to participate in economic activities in Mal\u00e9. By reducing time \nspent in the Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, total transit time for travel between outer atolls and the capital \nwill be reduced, resulting in passenger and inventory cost savings as well as an increase in \nagricultural produce originating from outer islands in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor markets. The reduction \nof vessel turnaround time in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will lead to increased frequency of service and \nsafer traveling conditions for the atoll community and thus benefit the poorest section of the \npopulation. In addition, the Project will remove the principal cause of congestion on Marine \nDrive, a major Mal\u00e9 road corridor, benefiting all road and vessel users. \n \n50.  Consulting activities included under the infrastructure investment consulting and the \ninstitutional  development  and  capacity  building  components  are  designed  to  mitigate  gaps \nidentified  in  institutional  and  human  resources  capabilities,  and  to  support  the  creation  of \ncapacity to handle sector issues in the long term. Technical support is provided during project \nimplementation to assist in (i) development of harbor usage charges; and (ii) establishment of \nformal, regular, and transparent processes for setting harbor usage charges. Harbor usage \ncharges are expected to positively impact financial O&M cost recovery for existing infrastructure \nassets in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor and Vilin\u2019gili Harbor as well as project-created assets. MTC\u2019s \ncapacity  will  be  strengthened  in  the  areas  of  (i)  strategic  planning  and  policy  analysis, \n(ii) maritime  safety  regulations  and  vessel  inspections  and  registration  procedures,  and \n(iii) monitoring of project impact and performance. MCPI\u2019s capacity in the areas of (i) harbor \nmanagement, and (ii) financial management will be enhanced under the Project.  \n \nB.  Economic and Financial Analyses \n  1.  Economic Internal Rate of Return \n51.  The  economic  evaluation  compares  the  cost  and  benefits  of  the  Project  from  the \nviewpoint of the national economy by comparing the cost of the Project by identified beneficiary \ngroups: (i) passengers and cargo owners, and (ii) vessel owners. If Mal\u00e9 North Harbor is not \nimproved, the main consequence for the economy would be the loss of prospective benefits for \nexisting harbor users. Because of the current congestion caused by the heavy concentration of \ntraffic,  delays  and  time  loss  represent  the  most  significant  factor.  Annual  user  benefits  to \n \n ", "  15\npassengers and cargo owners immediately after completion of construction exceed $0.2 million, \nwith vessel-owner benefits reaching more than $0.5 million. The annual benefits streams, which \nexceed $1.8 million per year by 2019, are compared with the total capital cost of $4.43 million. \nThe economic internal rate of return (EIRR) is estimated at 22.5%. Sensitivity and risk analysis \nindicate that the EIRR is robust under all conditions. A summary of the economic analysis is in \nAppendix 11 and detailed economic analysis is in Supplementary Appendix E. \n \n  2.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n52.  The  financial  analysis  appraises  the  sustainability  and  viability  of  proposed  project \ninvestments in accordance with Financial Management and Analysis of Projects23 on a with- and \nwithout-Project basis. A summary of the financial analysis is in Appendix 12 and detailed \nfinancial analysis is in Supplementary Appendix F. Financial projections up to 2033 for Mal\u00e9 \nNorth Harbor, comprising the existing 200 m quay wall along Marine Drive and the proposed \n290 m quay to be developed under the Project, include assumptions for both cost and revenue. \nCost  assumptions  include  O&M  cost,  annual,  and  one-off  maintenance  costs.  Revenue \nassumptions include a preliminary analysis of likely harbor usage charges. Proposed harbor \nusage charges vary from Rf4 to Rf5 per meter per day. Impact assessments suggest a net \npositive benefit under this proposed structure. Details of harbor usage charge analysis are in \nSupplementary Appendix G.  \n \n53.  Under the above assumptions, a base case, after tax, financial internal rate of return \n(FIRR)  has  been  calculated  as  3.16%  in  real  terms  and  using  end  of  2006  prices.  This \ncompares  favorably  to  the  Project\u2019s  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  of  1.36%, \nsignifying  the  Project\u2019s  sustainability.  Loan  assurances  have  been  included  to  ensure \nimplementation of harbor usage charges to cover costs with regard to equity, affordability, and \nharmonization of charges between harbors. The financial management assessment conducted \nled to formulation of a financial management strengthening program included in the institutional \ndevelopment and capacity building component. \n \nC.  Social Impacts \n  1.  Poverty and Social Dimensions \n54.  The project coverage is nationwide. For 70% of the population (about 209,189 people) \nresiding in outer atolls, the need to commute between their home island and Mal\u00e9 is high. \nImprovements to the transport network facilitated by the Project will decrease transport costs \nand provide benefits to vessel owners, passengers, and cargo owners residing in outer atolls. \n \n55.  Isolation is an important element, resulting in human poverty in the majority of the atolls \noutside Mal\u00e9. Limited transportation opportunities add to remoteness and isolation, with the \nresult that there are significant disparities of income and of access to social services in the \nremote  atolls.  Limited  access  to  transport  infrastructure  negatively  impacts  planned  or \nemergency visits to schools and medical services for those residing in outer islands, particularly \nfor women and children.  \n \n56.  The Project will contribute to benefits for island-based communities through reduced \nturnaround time for vessels in Mal\u00e9, and the expected resulting increase in the frequency and \n                                                 \n23 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n  ", "16   \nsafety of vessel trips between outer islands and Mal\u00e9. A summary poverty reduction and social \nstrategy is in Appendix 13.  \n \n  2.  Land Acquisition and Resettlement \n57.  All of the land required for the Project is owned by the Government. It is expected that \nno land will have to be acquired from private landowners and no resettlement will be involved.  \n  \n  3.  Environmental Aspects \n58.  The  infrastructure  investment  component  is  based  on  an  approved  land  use  plan \nprepared by MHUD. In accordance with ADB\u2019s Environmental Assessment Guidelines,24 the \ninvestment component of the Project is classified a \u201cB\u201d project. The Project is subject to the \nEnvironmental Protection and Preservation Act, 1993, and requires the preparation of an initial \nenvironmental examination (IEE) report, according to the Government\u2019s regulations. The IEE \nreport  has  been  prepared  and  submitted  to  MEEW  for  review;  a  \u201cDecision  Note\u201d,  which \nconstitutes the environmental clearance of the Project, has been obtained.  \n \n59.  The IEE carried out a screening process that determined the potential environmental \nimpacts caused by the location, construction, and operation of the subproject as well as the \ndirect and indirect effects on the existing environment. The impacts were assessed to be either \ninsignificant or temporary, and reversible and manageable. Mitigation measures to prevent or \nminimize unnecessary impacts are also provided. The mitigation approach is mainly through \nintegrating information and understanding of the local hydrodynamic process into the project \nengineering design to reduce other potential environmental impacts and the need for mitigation, \nespecially during project operation. Potential impacts and risks during construction were also \ncharacterized as short-term. Unnecessary impacts will be minimized through good construction \nmanagement and housekeeping practices. An EMP, including a monitoring plan to mitigate the \npotential impacts, has been prepared to ensure that the Project will be implemented in an \nenvironmentally  sound  and  sustainable  manner.  The  summary  IEE,  including  EMP,  is  in \nSupplementary  Appendix  H.  The  EMP  will  be  updated  by  the  infrastructure  investment \nconsultants during detailed design. Therefore, any additional requirements from MEEW will be \nincorporated during the detailed design.  \n \n60.  The IEE shows that there are no significant environmental impacts that need further \ndetailed study or environmental impact assessment. All potential and associated impacts can be \naddressed  through  implementation  of  the  mitigation  measures  as  proposed  in  the  IEE. \nProvisions are made in the project cost to cover environmental mitigation and monitoring. \nTherefore, the IEE is sufficient for the proposed Project and, with its proposed environmental \nmanagement and monitoring program, can be considered the completed environmental impact \nassessment. \n \nD.  Risks \n61.  The December 2004 tsunami resulted in a significant number of harbor reconstruction \nprojects, which have caused additional strain on MCPI\u2019s limited human resource base. The \nconsequent risk of potential delays in the construction of the additional 290 m quay wall in Mal\u00e9 \nNorth Harbor has been mitigated through the provision of consulting services in the form of a \nproject  management  assistance  group  under  the  infrastructure  investment  consulting \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2003. Environmental Assessment Guidelines. Manila. \n \n ", "  17\ncomponent. The detailed design and construction supervision will be carried out by the same \nconsulting firm engaged under the infrastructure investment component to mitigate the risk of \npotentially  split  liability.  Enhancement  of  MTC\u2019s  planning  and  regulatory  capabilities  are \nsupported through the institutional development and capacity building component. The long-\nterm sustainability of these interventions is subject to adequate staffing of the PMU and PIUs, \nand  to  the  retention  of  trained  staff.  During  processing,  the  Government  requested  ADB \nassistance in recruiting the consulting firms necessary for project implementation. Based on an \nassessment of the capacity of the agencies to be involved in project implementation, the request \nwas considered justified. Consequently, the risk of delay in recruitment of consulting services \nhas been significantly reduced. \n \n62.  Because of the high proportion of benefits to be realized from the outset by existing \nusers of Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, there are no significant risks associated with the Project\u2019s benefit \nstreams. Extensive reconstruction works undertaken recently as a result of the tsunami provide \nample experience for capital cost estimates, therefore the risk variations in actual cost are \nconsidered low. O&M cost estimates are based on actual cost applied in Mal\u00e9 South West \nHarbor, a comparable harbor.  \n \nV.  ASSURANCES \nA.  Specific Assurances \n63.  In  addition  to  the  standard  assurances,  the  Government  has  given  the  following \nassurances, which have been incorporated in the legal documents: \n \n  Institutional Realignment \n \n(i)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  the  action  plan  for \ninstitutional realignment of MTC's maritime transport activities within its sector \nmandate, as developed with assistance from consultants engaged for institutional \nand capacity building component (the Institutional Consultants), commences not \nlater than 31 May 2008. \n \n  Harbor Usage Charge Structures \n \n(ii)  The Government will ensure that a harbor usage charge structure for the Mal\u00e9 \nNorth Harbor and Vilin\u2019gili Harbor is finalized and approved for implementation \nwithin  18  months  of  loan  effectiveness  to  ensure  compliance  with  the  cost \nrecovery covenant. With support from the Institutional Consultants, the IA will \n(a) review  potential  usage  charge  structures  including  with  relevant  price \nsegmentation  within  15  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness,  (b)  subsequently \nsubmit  to  ADB  and  the  Government  for  discussion,  a  recommended  usage \ncharge  structure  or  structures  within  16  months  of  the  loan  effectiveness, \n(c) facilitate approval of the agreed final usage charge structure such that formal \napproval is gained within 18 months of the loan effectiveness, and (d) commence \nimplementation within 18 months of the loan effectiveness. \n \n  Financial Management \n \n(iii)  With support from the Institutional Consultants, PWS will implement financial \nmanagement system reforms such that all Mal\u00e9 North Harbor related assets, \n  ", "18   \nexpenditures, and revenues can be recorded and reported in accordance with \ngenerally  accepted  accounting  principles.  The  financial  management  system \nreform action plan will be established within 24 months of loan effectiveness. \nFinancial reports from the systems above will be made publicly available through \nMCPI\u2019s website, and regularly reported to MTC and MoFT. \n \nAssets \n \n(iv)  The Government will ensure that responsibility for management of Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbor related assets remains with PWS and no changes are made without prior \nconsultation with ADB. \n \nRevenues and Cost Recovery \n \n(v)  The Government will ensure that PWS is given the mandate to levy and collect \nharbor usage charges in Mal\u00e9 North and Vilin\u2019gili harbors in accordance with the \naccepted harbor usage charge structure.  \n \n(vi)  For  the  period  when  harbor  usage  charges  are  not  adequate  to  cover  all \noperations and maintenance costs at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, the Government will \nensure that adequate budget allocations are made in a timely manner to PWS for \nmeeting the gap.  \n \n(vii)  The Government will ensure that PWS implements harbor usage charges such \nthat 75% of cost recovery of O&M is achieved within 3 years after completion of \nthe Project, and 100% cost recovery of O&M is achieved within 4 years after the \ncompletion of the Project.  \n \nCounterpart Funds  \n \n(viii)  The Government will ensure that throughout the implementation of the Project, \nadequate  budgetary  allocations  of  the  required  counterpart  funds  are  made \navailable, approved, and released in a timely manner.  \n \n(ix)  The Government will ensure that MPA will (a) demolish the building located on \nthe government-owned 16 m wide strip of land (adjacent to the Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbor)  currently  occupied  by  MPA,  including  trees,  and  cover  all  costs \nassociated with such demolition; and (b) make the land and rights in land, free \nfrom  any  encumbrances  required  before  commencement  of  construction \nactivities relating to the contract. The Government will ensure that the physical \nconditions of such land are not altered. \n \nAnticorruption  \n \n(x)  The Government, the EA, and the IA will follow ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy \n(1998,  as  amended  to  date).  Consistent  with  its  commitment  to  good \ngovernance,  accountability,  and  transparency,  ADB  reserves  the  right  to \ninvestigate,  directly  or  through  its  agents,  any  alleged  corrupt,  fraudulent, \ncollusive, or coercive practices relating to the Project. To support these efforts, \nthe EA and the IA will (a) carry out periodic inspections on the contractors\u2019 \nactivities related to fund withdrawals and settlements; and (b) include relevant \n \n ", "  19\nprovisions in contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project specifying \nthe right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of the EA and \nthe IA and all contractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as \nthey relate to the Project. \n \nMeasures to Enhance Good Governance and Transparency \n \n(xi)  The Government will ensure implementation of the additional specific measures \nto enhance governance and prevent corruption. Such measures include, but are \nnot limited to: (a) continued consultant support to MCPI PIU staff on procurement \nand project management; (b) harbor management training to MCPI PIU staff, \nincluding  training  in  collection  of  harbor  usage  charges;  and  (c)  improving \nfinancial management  systems and practices. Specific measures to increase \ntransparency under the Project include random and independent spot checks by \nADB  review  missions  on  procurement  and  financial  project  accounts.  The \nGovernment will ensure that procurement of all civil works necessary for the \nProject will be undertaken by the Government through the Tender Evaluation \nBoard under MoFT. \n \nEnvironment, Resettlement, and Social \n \n(xii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that:  (a)  the  Project  facilities  are  constructed, \noperated,  maintained,  and  monitored  in  accordance  with  (i)  all  applicable \nenvironmental laws and regulations of the Republic of Maldives, and (ii) ADB\u2019s \nEnvironment Policy (2002) as amended from time to time; (b) the IEE including \nEMP  will  be  updated  during  the  detailed  design  stage;  (c)  all  required \nenvironmental  mitigation  measures  in  the  IEE  including  the  EMP  are \nincorporated into the Project design, bidding document for civil works contract, \nand implemented accordingly; (d) any adverse environmental impacts arising \nfrom  the  Project  are  minimized  by  implementing  the  mitigation  measures \nprescribed  in  the  IEE;  and  (e)  the  civil  works  contract  entered  into  with \ncontractors includes obligations of contractors relating to environment, including \nmitigation and monitoring measures as specified in the IEE. The Government will \nfurther ensure that both compliance with the environmental mitigation measures \nand  environmental  monitoring  results  collected  throughout  the  Project  are \nsubmitted by the Government to ADB every 6 months. \n \n(xiii)  The  Government  will  ensure  that  the  Project  does  not  require  any  land \nacquisition or involuntary resettlement. In case of any change in the Project \ndesign  and  consequent  land  acquisition  and  resettlement  impacts,  the \nGovernment  will  inform  ADB,  prepare  necessary  resettlement  plans  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s Involuntary Resettlement Policy (1995) and all applicable \nlaws and regulations of the Government, disclose these resettlement plans to \naffected people, and submit them to ADB for approval prior to award of civil \nworks contracts.  \n \n(xiv)  The Government will ensure that all civil works will comply with all applicable \nlabor laws; do not employ child labor for construction and maintenance activities; \nencourage employment of the poor, particularly women; and will not differentiate \nwages between men and women for work of equal value.

Introduction \n1.  The  geophysical  setting  of  the  Maldives\u2014with  small,  remote,  and  widely  dispersed \nisland  communities\u2014creates  a  critical  role  for  maritime  transport  in  ensuring  access  to \neconomic and social development opportunities. Large distances\u2014in combination with slow and \nuncomfortable maritime transportation, variable demand, lack of economies of scale, limited \neconomic  activity  in  remote  atolls  to  finance  travel  needs,  and  adverse  seasonal  weather \nconditions\u2014result  in  high  transport  cost  and  limited  transportation  opportunities.  While  air \ntransport  is  a  gradually  developing  sector,  maritime  transport  remains  the  most  important \ntransport mode in the country.  \n \nB.  Maritime Transport Sector \n2.  The Government\u2019s direct role in the sector has focused on provision of international and \ndomestic maritime transport infrastructure and on regulation of domestic maritime transport \nservices in the areas of safety, vessel inspections, and vessel registrations.  \n \n  1.  International Maritime Transport Infrastructure \n3.  Until 2006, most of the country\u2019s imports arrived in Mal\u00e9 Commercial Harbor (MCH),1 \nwhich is located on the northwestern part of the capital island and operated by Maldives Ports \nAuthority (MPA), a fully owned government entity established in 1986. MPA reports to the \nMinistry  of  Transport  and  Communication  (MTC)  and  is  responsible  for  the  operation  and \nmaintenance (O&M) of all commercial ports in the Maldives, which includes the two regional \nports commissioned in 2006. MPA operates on a commercial basis, is debt-free, and contributes \npositively in the form of dividends and land rent to government revenues. All international trade \nrelated shipments occur through the commercial ports. MCH, which can accommodate ships up \nto 15,000 gross ton (GT) and has a 10.5 meter (m) draft, handled a throughput of 416,457 \nmetric ton in 2005 (95% imports and 5% exports). About 40% of total imports are reshipped to \nouter atolls, and 90% of this domestic interchange occurs via Mal\u00e9 North Harbor. MCH currently \noperates above capacity. The lack of space available on Mal\u00e9, in particular for container storage \nand handling, severely constrains future expansion options and the Government has identified \nnew alternative sites to relocate MCH.2 To ease the capacity constraints of MCH and in line with \nthe Government\u2019s national development strategies of creating regional development centers, \ntwo regional ports became operational in 2006: HD. Kulhuduffushi Regional Port in the Northern \nDevelopment  Region  and  the  S.  Hithadhoo  Regional  Port,  in  the  Southern  Development \nRegion. The regional ports cater to commercial import cargo and are designed to specifications \nthat are markedly different from the vessel requirements and harbor specifications of domestic \nmaritime  transport.  HD.  Kulhuduffushi  Regional  Port  has  a  170  m  x  -5  m  quay,  which \naccommodates ships up to 1,000 GT. S. Hithadhoo Regional Port accommodates ships up to \n3,000 GT and has a draft of 8 m.  \n \n                                                 \n1  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided assistance to the development of MCH through two loans: \n(i) ADB. 1988. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of the Maldives for the Mal\u00e9 Port Development Project. Manila; and \n(ii) ADB. 1993. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Loan and \nTechnical Assistance Grant to the Republic of the Maldives for the Second Mal\u00e9 Port Project. Manila. \n2  The World Bank is providing technical assistance through the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) \nto support the Government in its objective of developing the future location of MCH on a public-private partnership \nbasis. Consultants for the 4-month assignment mobilized in January 2007. \n ", "26   Appendix 2 \n4.  The Government has agreed to allow a potential private sector investor to assess the \nfeasibility of establishing a container transshipment terminal in the northern part of the Maldives. \nThe feasibility of the potential project is likely to be sensitive to expansions in regional capacity. \nIt is understood that the roles of the public and private sector in the potential project remain to \nbe delineated.  \n \n  2.  Domestic Maritime Transport Infrastructure in Mal\u00e9 \n5.  Mal\u00e9, the national hub island, is rectangular in shape and has harbors on three of its four \nsides. The harbors in Mal\u00e9 are used for distinctively different activities. Usage patterns are \ncodified in guidelines issued by the Ministry of Construction and Public Infrastructure (MCPI)3 as \nfollows. Starting at the eastern end of the north side of Mal\u00e9 (Map 1), the first harbor is used for \nferry terminals for Mal\u00e9 International Airport and the newly reclaimed island of Hulhumal\u00e9. \nProgressing westward along the north side is the area known as the Mal\u00e9 North East Harbor, \nwhich holds the moorings for the National Security Service patrol, Coast Guard Vessels, and \nother government craft. The main service jetties for public passenger transport services and \nofficial government jetties are also part of Mal\u00e9 North East Harbor.  \n \n6.  A project to transfer the existing fish market from its current onshore location along \nMarine Drive to a reclaimed area of approximately 2,000 square meters (m2) extended in front of \nits present position into the harbor basin is currently ongoing in the eastern part of Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbor.  The  construction  of  the  fish  market  will  provide  a  barrier  partitioning  the  existing \ncommon basin for Mal\u00e9 North East Harbor and Mal\u00e9 North Harbor basin into two separate \nbasins. The berthing facilities that will become available on the eastern side of the new fish \nmarket are to be reserved for fishing vessels. The fish market relocation project is scheduled for \ncompletion by the end of 2007.  \n \n7.  Mal\u00e9 North Harbor is the gateway to the capital for the outer atoll population, and is \nreserved for inter-atoll passenger and cargo vessels. The harbor currently consists of a quay \nwall of 200 meters (m) along Marine Drive from the west side of the existing fish market up to \nthe existing boundary wall of MCH. The harbor has an external seawall and offers unused \nspace with potential for quay wall development in protected waters. At present, the area has no \ninfrastructure supporting loading and unloading, and lack of harbor management hinders the \nefficiency of its operations. Harbor management responsibilities for harbors located on the \nnorthern part of Mal\u00e9 up to Mal\u00e9 North West Harbor primarily rest with MCPI, with inputs from \nMinistry of Housing and Urban Development (MHUD), MTC, and Mal\u00e9 Municipality. With the \nexception of MCH, no charges for loading and unloading are currently levied for the use of the \nharbors on the northern side of the island. Operation and maintenance (O&M) costs are covered \nthrough the central budget. \n \n8.  Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor, located on the southwest corner of Mal\u00e9, is used by (i) heavy \ndomestic cargo vessels, including construction materials; (ii) resort vessels; (iii) landing craft \nexporting solid waste from Mal\u00e9 to Thilafushi; (iv) vessels carrying hazardous materials; and \n(v) also functions as the passenger ferry terminal for the island of Vilin\u2019gili. The harbor has a \ncentral  loading  and  unloading  jetty  for  cargo  vessels.  Mobile  cranes  facilitate  loading  and \nunloading. The south side quay wall of Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor is used for berthing of vessels \nservicing the tourist resorts. Mooring is permitted in the lee of the breakwater. The Public Works \nServices (PWS) Section of MCPI manages all areas of Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor, ensures that \nquays are used as designated, and sets and collects harbor user charges sufficient to meet \nO&M costs. \n \n                                                 \n3 The most recent guidelines are in effect from 1 September 2006. \n ", "    Appendix 2  27 \n  3.  Atoll and Island Harbors \n9.  A  total  of  197  of  the  1,190  islands  in  the  Maldives  are  inhabited.  Although  a \ncomprehensive list of the status of harbor infrastructure in inhabited islands does not exist, it is \nestimated that approximately 50% of the inhabited islands lack basic transport infrastructure \nfacilities, adding to their isolation and lack of access to economic opportunities. A combination \nof natural and artificial harbors constitutes the core of atoll and island harbor infrastructure. \nHarbor basins typically have a depth of \u20132.5 m, although new harbors are being constructed to \n\u20133.0 m. Harbor basins are protected by breakwaters\u2014originally constructed by corals, but now \nmostly replaced by walls constructed of imported rock and concrete quay walls. The National \nHarbor and Reclamation Programme contains a non-prioritized list of strategically selected \nharbors, involving investments of an average of Rf25 million per harbor. Investment decisions \nare made by the Ministerial Committee on Harbor Dredging and Land Reclamation. Other \nprograms, such as the Access Programme and the Tsunami Rehabilitation Programme, add to \nthe plans for upgrading of domestic maritime transport infrastructure facilities. In addition, MCPI \nhas developed a list comprising about half of all inhabited islands, for which it is proposed that \n\u201ca good standard harbor\u201d is constructed or upgraded through repair by the end of 2008. No user \ncharges are currently levied on users of transport infrastructure in atoll and island harbors. \nMinor O&M costs are covered by boat owners and through Island Office funds. Major repair \nworks are covered through central government funds directed from the Ministry of Finance and \nTreasury (MoFT) to MCPI. \n \nC.  Domestic Maritime Transport Services \n10.  The market structure for domestic maritime transport services consists of a mix of partly \npublic and private operation and ownership. The transport services sector is primarily \u201con-\ndemand\u201d based and is characterized by the lack of a system of countrywide regular, scheduled \ntransport passenger and cargo services. \n \n11.  Scheduled transport passenger services have primarily been provided by the Maldives \nTransport  and  Contracting  Company  (MTCC),4 a  state-owned  enterprise.  MTCC5 operates \nregular  passenger  transport  services  from  Mal\u00e9  to:  (i)  the  Baa  Atoll  in  the  North  Central \nDevelopment Region; (ii) Vilin\u2019gili and Hulhumal\u00e9 Harbors within the Mal\u00e9 Atoll; and (iii) other \nislands within the Mal\u00e9 Atoll. Since mid-2006, MTCC has embarked on an ambitious project of \ninitiating a \u201ccomprehensive prescheduled maritime transport network\u201d nationwide. The project \naims at providing inter-atoll and interisland maritime passenger transport services centered on \nregional airports and expected future economic growth centers on a network basis. The network \napproach will provide transport services establishing connections between Mal\u00e9, select atolls, \nand islands within these atolls. Therefore, it is broader than the previous \u201chub and spoke \nsystem\u201d. The project is likely to provide valuable lessons for the formulation of future public and \nprivate sector roles and responsibilities, based on exact demand data. \n \n12.  The passenger and cargo transport services segment served by individuals or island \ncommunities  is  fragmented  and  lacks  sufficient  size  to  create  economies  of  scale.  The \ntraditional vessels operated by individuals or island communities are slow, inefficient, and lack \npassenger facilities and safety features. Increased private sector participation in the provision of \ntransport services is hindered by lack of (i) clear policies governing the role of public and private \n                                                 \n4  Some 52.5% of the shares in MTCC are held directly by the Government. Another 7.5% of MTCC\u2019s shares are held \nby government-controlled companies, resulting in a total government majority of 60%. The managing director is \nappointed directly by the Government.  \n5  MTCC does not undertake cargo transport services but is involved in various other maritime transport sector \nsegments such as maritime dredging and construction work, island harbor construction, and supply of marine \nengines and equipment. \n ", "28   Appendix 2 \nparticipants, and (ii) access to technical advice and financial support to adapt and expand the \nfleet to meet emerging efficiency requirements in the sector.  \n \nD.  Institutional Arrangements \n13.  As a reflection of decision processes inherent in consensus-based cultures, combined \nwith the fact that changes in organizational mandates have historically developed on an ad hoc \nbasis without a whole-of-government approach, multiple ministries and agencies are involved in \ndomestic  maritime  transport  sector  decisions.  Formal  organizational  mandates  and \nresponsibilities tend to overlap. Therefore, informal consultation and cooperation processes \namong ministries form the basis of public service delivery. Senior government officials are \ngenerally highly qualified and many benefit from overseas educational backgrounds at master\u2019s \nand doctoral levels.  \n \n14.  The main sector ministries are MTC and MCPI. MTC has primary responsibility for \ninternational and domestic maritime transport infrastructure and services, including formulation \nof  transport  policies  and  regulation,  establishment  of  safety  standards,  and  for  conducting \nsurveys and registration of vessels. Apart from MPA\u2019s activities, MTC\u2019s sector involvement has \nfocused on policy and regulatory aspects of domestic maritime transport services. MCPI is \nresponsible  for  implementation  of  infrastructure  projects  in  the  Maldives.  MCPI\u2019s  PWS  is \nresponsible for O&M of domestic maritime transport infrastructure within Mal\u00e9, and sets and \ncollects harbor usage charges in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor.  \n \n15.  In  addition  to  MTC  and  MCPI,  the  Ministry  of  Planning  and  National  Development \n(MPND)  has  major  sector  influence  through  its  responsibilities  for  national  development \nplanning  and  aid  integration.  MPND  has  coordination  responsibilities  for  the  Ministerial \nCommittee on Harbor Dredging and Land Reclamation, which oversees technical aspects and \nprioritizes harbor construction works included in the National Harbor Program. MPND also \ncoordinates expenditure according to the Public Sector Investment Program\u2014a subcomponent \nof the national budget, which comprises expenditures for land acquisition, civil works, and large-\nscale  equipment;  and  ensures  government  counterpart  funding  for  these  budget  items  for \nnational development projects. The Ministry of Atolls Administration and line ministries (such as \nthe Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture and Marine Resources) propose islands in need of harbor \ndevelopment and submit their requirements and recommendations to the Ministerial Committee \non Harbor Dredging and Land Reclamation. The following ministries are represented in the \ncommittee: (i) MPND; (ii) MTC; (iii) MCPI; (iv) MHUD; (v) Ministry of Atolls Administration; (vi) \nMinistry of Environment, Energy and Water (MEEW); and (vii) Ministry of Fisheries, Agriculture \nand  Marine  Resources.  MoFT\u2019s  role  in  the maritime  transport  sector  relates  to  its  budget \nallocation,  monitoring,  and  oversight  responsibilities  with  regard  to  all  publicly-owned \ninfrastructures. MEEW is responsible for environmental policy and implementation, and reviews \ndetailed designs for environmental compliance. MEEW also conducts ongoing monitoring during \nand after construction. MHUD is responsible for developing, proposing, and regulating maritime \ntransport infrastructure and urban development activities nationwide; and for preparing the \naccompanying land usage plans. The Coast Guard, reporting to the Ministry of Defense, is \nresponsible for enforcing safety and other regulations affecting domestic maritime transport; and \nconducts search and rescue operations in national waters. \n \nE.  Government Strategy \n16.  The Government\u2019s Seventh National Development Plan (7NDP) covering 2006\u20132010 \nhighlights the importance of ensuring equitable opportunities and fairer distribution of income \nand  wealth.  Population  development  consolidation,  balanced  regional  development,  and \nincreasing private sector participation are part of the key strategies. In 2002\u2014with the purpose \nof achieving economies of scale in the provision of services and reduction of the unit cost of \n ", "    Appendix 2  29 \ntransport services\u2014the Government initiated a program of providing incentives for voluntary \nmigration to larger islands.   \n \n17.  Recognizing the paramount importance of the maritime transport sector in ensuring \npopulation-wide access to social and economic development opportunities, the 7NDP includes \n12 policies with supporting sub-strategies in the form of a combined land and sea transport road \nmap. Considering the lifeline characteristics of Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, improvement in the form of \nprovision of loading and unloading areas and new berthing facilities in this harbor is the highest \nprioritized investment proposal in the land and sea transport road map (included as policy 1). In \naddition, the 7NDP includes the following policies and sub-strategies of particular relevance to \nthe proposed Project: (i) harmonization of harbor charges between Mal\u00e9 North Harbor and Mal\u00e9 \nSouth West Harbor is included as sub-strategy 1.3; (ii) policy 4 notes that the role of the private \nsector as provider of transport services is to be strengthened; (iii) policy 6 states that human \nresources development and capacity building programs are to be introduced to ensure that the \ntransport sector has the staff, resources, and skills necessary to meet sector requirements; \n(iv) policy  7  outlines  the  need  for  promptly  initiating  institutional  changes  and  includes \nstrengthening of MTC\u2019s maritime transport section; (v) sub-strategy 7.5 refers to the need for \nimproving management of domestic maritime transport infrastructure in Mal\u00e9; and (vi) policy 11 \noutlines actions necessary to improve safety measures, including marine navigation.  \n \nF.  Asian Development Bank (ADB) Sector Strategy and Support under the Proposed \nProject \n  1.  Domestic Maritime Transport Infrastructure \n18.  ADB supports the Government\u2019s policy choice of maintaining ownership and operation of \ndomestic  maritime  transport  infrastructure  in  the  short  to  medium  term.  Assistance  to  the \nimprovement  of  the  Government\u2019s  highest-ranked  transport  infrastructure  investment,  Mal\u00e9 \nNorth Harbor, constitutes the core investment of the proposed Project, which was included in \nthe country strategy and program update.6 ADB also supports the Government\u2019s long-term \nsector  objectives  of  ensuring  separation  of  maritime  transport  sector  policy,  planning,  and \nregulatory functions from operational activities; the ongoing realignment initiatives in MTC; and \nthe strategic directions outlined in the 7NDP to introduce efficiency and sustainability targets to \nenhance public sector provision of domestic maritime transport infrastructure. These sector \nobjectives are supported under the loan through the institutional development and capacity \nbuilding component (Appendix 10).  \n \n  2.  Domestic Maritime Transport Services \n19.  Lack of access to finance has been identified as a major obstacle for increased private \nsector  participation  in  the  domestic  maritime  transport  services  sector.  ADB  is  currently \nexploring options for inclusion of financial assistance to private vessel owners under the Small \nand  Medium-Sized  Enterprise  Development  Project.7 In  tandem  with  these  efforts,  ADB\u2019s \nPrivate Sector Operations Department is exploring options for providing a loan to the Maldives \nFinance Leasing Company Pvt. Ltd., which offers leasing facilities to private vessel owners \nagainst security.  \n \n                                                 \n6  ADB. 2005.

Background  \n1.  The  infrastructure  investment  component  of  the  Domestic  Maritime  Transport  Project \nconsists of improvements to the existing Mal\u00e9 North Harbor through (i) construction of a new 290 \nmeter (m) long quay projecting northwards at right angles to Marine Drive alongside the boundary to \nMal\u00e9 Commercial Harbor, (ii) ancillary civil works, (iii) provision of cargo handling equipment, and \n(iv) construction of a temporary transit area for goods and passengers. \n \n2.  The consulting services under the infrastructure investment component will conduct detailed \ndesign,  preparation  of  tender  documents,  bid  evaluation,  construction  supervision,  and  project \nmanagement assistance. \n \n3.  Two groups of international and national consultants\u2014design and supervision group and \nproject management assistance group\u2014will be engaged by the Government through a firm over a \n21-month period. The consulting firm will be recruited through the quality- and cost-based selection \n(QCBS) method. All international and national consultants will be engaged in accordance with the \nAsian Development Bank\u2019s (ADB\u2019s) Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2006, as amended from \ntime to time) based on biodata technical proposals.  \n \nB.  Description of Consulting Inputs \n1.  Design and Supervision Group  \n4.  Objectives. The primary objective of the design and supervision group is to ensure that \nworks are designed in accordance with international engineering standards, and are constructed to \nthe prescribed quality in accordance with specifications, bidding documents, and quality assurance \nsystems. The group will work in close coordination with the head of the project implementation unit \n(PIU) under the Ministry of Construction and Public Infrastructure (MCPI).  \n \n5.  Scope of Work. The group\u2019s specific activities to be carried out include, but are not limited \nto, the following: \n \n(i)  Review available surveys and studies, including the final report of Domestic Maritime \nTransport Project1 prepared by Opus International, New Zealand; the land use plan \nprepared  by  Maldives  Housing  and  Urban  Development  Board;  traffic  studies \nconducted by the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MTC); and existing \nmeteorological, geotechnical, hydrographic, and topographic data. \n \n(ii)  Identify  requirements  of  field  surveys  and  other  investigations.  Based  on  the \nrequirement  assessment,  carry  out  all  the  required  engineering  surveys  and \ninvestigations  with  the  agreement  of  the  head  of  the  MCPI  PIU,  including \nbathymetric survey and construction material survey.

Traffic Forecasts \n1.  Domestic transport in the Maldives is almost entirely by sea and predominantly centered on \nMal\u00e9 North Harbor. This pattern is largely expected to continue in the future, albeit tempered by a \ngreater role for air travel by passengers and by growth of regional economic centers and associated \nregional ports in the north and south of the country. Therefore, total traffic forecasts are based on \nanticipated population and economic growth as well as induced traffic generated by improved \nfacilities and services. While Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will continue to dominate in domestic travel and \ntransport, its share of future growth\u2014both for passengers and freight\u2014is expected to decline until \ntraffic levels largely stabilize. \n \n2.  Interisland traffic volumes at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor have been estimated as follows for 2005, \nexcluding passenger ferries: \n \n(i)  Passengers inbound through Mal\u00e9 North Harbor (equal outbound): 174,794 persons \n(ii) Cargo inbound through Mal\u00e9 North Harbor:                45,467 tons \n(iii) Cargo outbound through Mal\u00e9 North Harbor:              189,329 tons \n(iv) Vessel calls, Mal\u00e9 North Harbor:                     2,500 calls \n \n3.  Projected passenger and freight traffic at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor throughout the life of the \nProject is in Table A11.1. Further details are in Supplementary Appendix E, section C.  \n \nTable A11.1:  Forecast of Interisland Passenger and Freight Traffic \nthrough Mal\u00e9 North Harbor  \nPassengers  Inbound Cargo  Outbound Cargo \nYear  (1 way MNH)  (tons to MNH)  (tons from MNH) \n2005  174,794  45,467  189,329 \n2010  228,372   50,199   247,362  \n2015  276,500   56,796   292,355  \n2020  300,659   64,259   310,160  \n2025  308,251   72,703   310,160  \n2030  316,035   82,257   310,160  \nMNH = Mal\u00e9 North Harbor. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n4.  Demand for freight and passenger services has been converted into vessel calls at Mal\u00e9 \nNorth Harbor (Table A11.2).1 Medium-sized vessels average 60 tons cargo capacity, and large \nvessels can carry an average of 150 tons. Vessels travel essentially fully loaded when they return to \nthe islands. With growing demand over time, it is assumed that economies of scale will promote \ngreater use of larger vessels. In addition, with the development of the northern and southern \nregional centers, a system of cargo transshipment and distribution may develop outside Mal\u00e9. \nTherefore, the role of large vessels is expected to increase and their number of calls is assumed to \ngrow by 4% per annum. This scenario means that, over the course of the planning period, the \nproportion of large vessel calls will grow from 20% to 50% and their share of tonnage carried will \ngrow from 38% to 73%.  \n \n \n                                                 \n1 With the Project, it has been calculated that sufficient capacity will exist at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor to accommodate the \nforecast cargo volumes and vessel traffic as long as the recommended harbor management and efficiency inducements \nare introduced. \n ", "  Appendix 11  47\nTable A11.2: Forecast of Interisland Vessel Calls at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor \nYear  Medium Vessels  Large Vessels  Total Vessels \n2005  2,000  500  2,500 \n2010  2,602   608   3,210  \n2015  3,022   740   3,762  \n2020  2,918   900   3,818  \n2025  2,430   1,096   3,526  \n2030  1,837   1,333   3,170  \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \nB.  Costs \n  1.  Location of Proposed Project \n5.  Alternative  locations  for  the  proposed  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor  Project  on  Mal\u00e9  island  and \nelsewhere within the Mal\u00e9 atoll were investigated. The analysis concluded that no lower cost \nlocation is available\u2014either from a capital or operating perspective. Based on the evaluation of \npossible alternative layouts at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, the proposed Project is deemed the least-cost \noption most responsive to the needs identified to better serve the interisland fleet. Further details \nare in Supplementary Appendix E, section E. \n \n  2.  Capital Investment Costs \n6.  Capital costs for the Project are estimated at $4,432,313 (Rf57.0 million). \n \n7.  Capital renewal of $100,000 for pavement resurfacing, equipment replacement, etc. has \nbeen budgeted at 5-year intervals. \n \n  3.  Operating Costs \n8.  Annual civil maintenance costs, including any future maintenance dredging if required, are \nbudgeted at 0.5% of the total capital cost. For equipment, 5% of initial capital expenditure is \nbudgeted for annual maintenance.  \n \n9.  It  is  assumed  that  a  total  operational  staff  of  16  will  be  required  for  24-hour  harbor \nmanagement (12 operational staff plus 4 financial clerks for revenue collection). This is similar to \nthe staffing structure currently in place at Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor.2 At an average compensation \npackage of Rf61,000, the total cost for 16 staff is Rf976,000. Ten percent has been added to this \namount for management and overhead, and an additional 12% for utilities, etc., for an initial total \nannual operating cost of Rf1.2 million ($93,750).

The  standard  shadow  cost  factor  for  local  labor  and  inputs  in  the  Maldives  is  0.9. \nAccordingly, the initial project economic costs are considered to be as follows: \n \n(i)  Initial capital cost:                            $3,989,082 \n(ii)  Five-yearly capital renewal budget:     $90,000 \n(iii)  Annual maintenance cost:                          $22,356  \n(iv)  Initial annual operating cost:                          $84,375 \n     \n12.  Benefits are calculated for a 25-year operational period beginning mid-2009. \n \n13.  The project preparatory technical assistance (PPTA) for the Domestic Maritime Transport \nProject3 calculated that vessels currently must wait 2 days or more after arrival in Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbor before they can berth alongside the quay for the safest and most efficient cargo loading and \ndischarge.4 The report went on to conclude that this wait to berth can be largely eliminated by the \nadditional quay capacity created through the Project, and calculated an average saving per vessel \nof 1.4 days in port. The PPTA also concluded that, in addition to time saved waiting for a berth, \nefficient harbor management and provision of mechanical handling should further accelerate vessel \nturnaround at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor\u2014in total up to nearly 50% of time currently spent in the harbor. \nImposition of a fee structure is expected to serve as a financial catalyst for more rapid discharge \nand loading (footnote 3). Over time, the foregoing factors are, very conservatively, expected to \nmatch the benefits of berth waiting savings. A reduction in trip time results in benefits for both \nvessel users (cargo owners and passengers) and vessel owners. \n \n14.  The primary benefit stream consists of vessel cost savings caused by faster turnaround in \nport. The PPTA estimated value per day at berth for interisland vessels to be Rf1,816 ($142) for \nmedium-sized vessels and Rf3,175 ($248) for large vessels (footnote 3). \n \n15.  The planned introduction of a pricing scheme at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will recapture a portion \nof this benefit. For this reason, harbor revenues have not been included as an economic benefit as \nthis would result in a double count. However, vessel owners still benefit since the cumulative time \nsavings over the course of a year will allow them to add extra revenue-generating trips.  \n \n16.  The additional measurable benefit of the Project is the expected easing of road traffic \ncongestion  along  Marine  Drive  adjacent  to  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor.  When  the  new  quay  begins \noperations,  loading  and  unloading  of  cargo  at  the  existing  200  meter  (m)  quay  wall  along \nMarine Drive will be restricted in order to reduce vehicle congestion. It is expected that the average \nspeed of vehicles passing Mal\u00e9 North Harbor during rush hours will increase from 8 kilometer per \nhour (km/h) to 24 km/h.   \n \n17.  The findings of the benefit and cost assessment clearly confirm the economic feasibility of \nthe Project with an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of 22.5% (Table A11.3). \n \n                                                 \n3 ADB. 2004.

During these operations, there is always the \nrisk of injury and cargo loss, and constant interruption to work on intervening vessels\u2014leading to loss of efficiency for all. \n ", "  Appendix 11  49\nTable A11.3:  Cost and Benefit Stream  \n($) \nCosts Benefits \nYear Net Benefits\nInitial Cost Operation Maintenance Total Passengera Vessela Vehicle Total\n2007 127,201     127,201 (127,201)\n2008 3,502,957  3,502,957 (3,502,957)\n2009   3 58,924    42,188     401,112 110,364 252,017 8,920 371,301 (29,810)\n2010    84,375        2 2,356     106,731 229,438 524,196 9,009 762,643 655,912\n2011    84,375        2 2,356     106,731 239,371 545,163 9,099 793,634 686,902\n2012    84,375        2 2,356     106,731 249,736 566,970 9,190 825,896 719,165\n2013    84,375        2 2,356     106,731 258,119 583,272 9,282 850,673 743,942\n2014    92,813      1 12,356     205,169 391,663 900,051 9,375 1,301,089 1,095,920\n2015    92,813        2 2,356     115,169 404,845 925,906 9,469 1,340,219 1,225,050\n2016    92,813        2 2,356     115,169 418,474 952,489 9,563 1,380,527 1,265,357\n2017    92,813        2 2,356     115,169 432,564 979,823 9,659 1,422,046 1,306,877\n2018    92,813        2 2,356     115,169 434,477 974,660 9,756 1,418,893 1,303,723\n2019  102,094      1 12,356     214,450 571,907 1,274,437 9,853 1,856,197 1,641,747\n2020  102,094        2 2,356     124,450 574,403 1,267,095 9,952 1,851,450 1,727,000\n2021  102,094        2 2,356     124,450 576,917 1,259,459 10,051 1,846,427 1,721,977\n2022  102,094        2 2,356     124,450 579,449 1,251,518 10,152 1,841,119 1,716,668\n2023  102,094        2 2,356     124,450 582,000 1,243,258 10,253 1,835,512 1,711,061\n2024  112,303      1 12,356     224,659 722,869 1,547,683 10,356 2,280,908 2,056,249\n2025  112,303        2 2,356     134,659 726,025 1,536,485 10,459 2,272,970 2,138,310\n2026  112,303        2 2,356     134,659 729,203 1,524,840 10,564 2,264,607 2,129,947\n2027  112,303        2 2,356     134,659 732,404 1,512,729 10,670 2,255,802 2,121,143\n2028  112,303        2 2,356     134,659 735,628 1,500,132 10,776 2,246,537 2,111,877\n2029  123,533      1 12,356     235,889 880,039 1,787,781 10,884 2,678,704 2,442,814\n2030  123,533        2 2,356     145,889 883,890 1,771,401 10,993 2,666,284 2,520,395\n2031  123,533        2 2,356     145,889 887,768 1,754,367 11,103 2,653,238 2,507,348\n2032  123,533        2 2,356     145,889 891,673 1,736,651 11,214 2,639,538 2,493,648\n2033  123,533        2 2,356     145,889 895,605 1,718,226 11,326 2,625,157 2,479,268\nIRR 22.5%\nNPV@12% 4,004,095\na 1.0 day saving for the first 5 years; subsequently, an additional 0.5 day saving at 5 year intervals. \nBoat owners and passengers take economic advantage of 50% of time saved. \nSource: Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n18.

Introduction \n1.  The project cost estimates indicate a $6.65 million investment plan, of which the Asian \nDevelopment  Bank  (ADB)  would  finance  80%  or  $5.33  million  through  its  Special  Funds \nresources. This financial analysis appraises the sustainability and viability of the proposed \nproject  investments  in  accordance  with  financial  management  and  analysis  of  projects.1 \nAssumptions with regard to the introduction of a harbor usage charge and ring fencing of Mal\u00e9 \nNorth  Harbor  operations  under  the  Public  Works  Services  (PWS)  Section  have  been \nincorporated in the sustainability analysis. \n \nB.  Financial Analysis Methodology and Approach \n2.  The  financial  analysis  focuses  on  the  infrastructure  investment  component,  which \nincludes construction of a 290 meter (m) L-shaped quay wall in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor. The Project \naims  at  creating  a  greenfield  revenue-generating  operation  at  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor,  through \nphysical asset creation and institutional development and capacity building efforts. This analysis \nassesses the ability of Mal\u00e9 North Harbor operations to meet future costs of operation and \nmaintenance (O&M) and debt servicing, on a present value basis, measured by a financial \ninternal rate of return (FIRR) and a net present value (NPV). Key assumptions have been made \nfor Mal\u00e9 North Harbor operations, leading to a with- and without-Project basis analysis, stream \nof incremental costs and revenues over a 25-year period, commencing from early 2009. This \nbase case financial model FIRR for Mal\u00e9 North Harbor is compared with the Project\u2019s weighted \naverage  cost  of  capital  (WACC)  to  determine financial  sustainability.  A  sensitivity  analysis \nfurther assesses the impact of changes in cost and revenue assumptions on the base case \nFIRR.  \n \nC.  Definitions and Assumptions \n3.  Assumptions made are considered reasonable and comparable to the existing Mal\u00e9 \nSouth West Harbor operations. All analysis was conducted in real terms at end of 2006 prices. \nDetailed assumptions are in Supplementary Appendix F. Capital expenditures for Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbor are distributed in line with the proposed implementation schedule and include all costs \nrelated to the physical investment in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, excluding consultancy, interest during \nconstruction, and contingency costs. \n \n1.  Revenue Assumptions \n4.  The Project has proposed for harbor usage charges to be implemented for Mal\u00e9 North \nHarbor from the start of operations in early 2009, i.e., immediately after completion of civil works \nand operationalization of project assets. The proposed rationale for harbor usage charges \n(Supplementary Appendix G) is rooted in achieving financial sustainability in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor \noperations and leads to four main lines of revenues from Mal\u00e9 North Harbor assets: (i) sea \nvessel loading charges for usage of the new quay wall, (ii) sea vessel mooring and or berthing \ncharges from usage of existing quay wall, (iii) charges to trucks or vehicles for accessing \nsurface areas, and (iv) charges for usage of cargo handling equipment. Proposed harbor usage \ncharges, defined as any charge levied on vessels or vehicles for the use of facilities within a \nharbor area, are in Table A12.1.  \n                                                 \n1 ADB. 2005.

The proposed 2009 charges of Rf5 ($0.39) per meter per day for loading activities and \nRf3.5\u20134.0 ($0.31) per meter per day for waiting and/or berthing and/or mooring are assumed to \ngrow in real terms over the period. The charges are considered reasonable in comparison with \nMal\u00e9 South West Harbor, which has a similarly segmented charge structure, but where charges \nare levied at a rate of Rf10 ($0.78) per meter per hour in the commercial zone. This reflects the \ndifference in user group as well as greater efficiencies at Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor.   \n6.  The revenue segmentation in Table A12.1 from segregated loading and mooring and/or \nberthing areas is proposed to achieve operational efficiencies in managing Mal\u00e9 North Harbor \nassets and is comparable to current operations management at Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor. All \nheavy loading activities are expected to be carried out along the new L-shaped quay wall being \ndeveloped under the Project, while all other activities (waiting and/or berthing and/or mooring) \nare to be carried out along the existing 200 m quay wall. This zonal segregation, combined with \nuser  charges  segmentation  impacts  revenue,  streams  from  different  activities;  and  will  be \nrefined  further  by  the  consultants  to  be  engaged  under  the  institutional  development  and \ncapacity building component. Mooring/berthing revenue lines include revenues from multiple \nrows of vessel moorings along the existing quay wall. \n7.  The first two revenue lines are a factor of the harbor usage charges, combined with sea \nvessel waiting times in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor. Therefore, assumptions have been made for waiting \ntimes based on current data and for a gradual decrease (medium-sized vessels from 10 days to \n6 days loading time, larger vessels from 15 days to 12 days loading time) over the 25 years as \nharbor management efficiencies, increase in physical capacity, and introduction of gradually \nincreasing harbor usage charges encourage quicker turnaround times. \n8.  The other revenue lines include time-based entry fees from loading trucks using the \ndesignated loading areas on top of the L-shaped quay, and from cargo handling equipment. To \n   \n ", "52   Appendix 12 \nreflect space constraints at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, charges at Rf12 per vehicle entry are higher \nthan at Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor, which currently charges Rf10 per day.  \n9.  Residual value for Mal\u00e9 North Harbor at the end of 25 years has been estimated at 35% \nof capital investment, given a 40-year life of assets. \n \n2.  Cost Assumptions\u2013Harbor Operations \n10.  Costs for a 16-person operational team at Mal\u00e9 North Harbor have been estimated \n(Rf960,000  or  $75,000  per  annum)  based  on  Mal\u00e9  South  West  Harbor  operating  team \nstructures. Staff numbers are assumed to gradually be reduced to 13 by 2013 as staff are \nshared  between  Mal\u00e9  South  West,  Mal\u00e9  North,  and  Vilin\u2019gili  harbors.  Administration  and \noverhead costs are assumed as 4% of wages and salary costs, gradually increasing to 7% (in \nreal terms) by 2014, as operational activities increase. Based on actual cost from Mal\u00e9 South \nWest  Harbor,  annual  maintenance  costs  are  estimated  at  Rf118,000  ($9,000)  per  annum. \nPaving works are expected to require one-off replacement every 10 years at an estimated 17% \nof the capital expenditure costs (included in the cost estimates as paving works). This periodic \ncost of Rf626,000 ($49,000) has been provisioned for annually.  \n \n3.  Weighted Average Cost of Capital \n11.  The WACC has been estimated assuming an 80/20 financing split between ADB debt \nand government counterpart funds, designated as equity capital. From the perspective of the \nProject,  debt  has  been  assumed  at  the  higher  of  the  ADB  interest  rates  (1.5%)  as  the \nGovernment will not onlend the debt funds to the Implementing Agency. The opportunity cost of \ngovernment equity has been estimated according to local treasury lending rates of around 7% \nplus a risk premium 3%. A long-term domestic inflation rate of 3% and 0 taxes per local \nregulations are also included in the calculation. The after-tax WACC rate is estimated at 1.36% \n(Table A12.2). \n \nTable A12.2: Weighted Average Cost of Capital \nFunding Sources  ADB  Government \nFunding Type  Debt  Equity \n(%)  (%) \nNominal Costsa  1.5  10.0 \nTax  0.0   \nAfter-Tax Debt Cost  1.5  10.0 \nInflation (international and domestic) b  2.8  3.0 \nReal Cost  0.0  7.0 \nCapital Percentages  80.0  20.0 \nComponent Costs Weighed  0.0  1.4 \nWACC (real) c  1.36 \na Cost of equity: long-term government treasury rate equivalent (7%) plus a risk \npremium of 3%.

Financial Analysis Results  \n13.  According to the above projections and WACC calculations, NPV was calculated at \n$1.253 million, with corresponding FIRR (in real terms) at 3.16% (Table A12.4). Since the \npositive NPV and FIRR outweigh the WACC of 1.36%, the Project\u2019s infrastructure investment \ncomponent is financially viable and sustainable. A sensitivity analysis was undertaken on the \nkey assumptions in the financial model. Despite various sensitivity scenarios, the financial \nmodel remains robust, with FIRR remaining above WACC (Table A12.4). Harbor usage charges \nremain the most critical issue for financial sustainability and need to be implemented after \n   \n ", "54   Appendix 12 \nproject completion. The base case harbor usage charge is estimated conservatively. It is likely \nthat higher harbor usage charges can be achieved during implementation.

Risk Assessment   \n14.  The crucial risk at a project level is the implementation of harbor usage charges, both in \nterms of time and levels to satisfy cost recovery. This is not considered to be a major risk for the \nfollowing reasons: (i) strong policy level support from the Seventh National Development Plan \n(7NDP) in implementing harbor usage charges to make the assets self-sustaining, as confirmed \nby  the  Ministry  of  Finance  and  Treasury  in  its  letter  of  1  February  2007  to  ADB;  (ii)  a \nprecedence for harbor usage charges at Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor; and (iii) a potential harbor \noperator (PWS) with experience in managing user fees from Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor and \nsustaining these operations purely from internal accruals without government support. However, \nthe user base in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, consisting of vessel traffic from outer atolls, is of a less \ncommercial composition than users of Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor and cannot be expected to bear \nthe same level of charges as users in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor.   \n \n15.  The  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  component  provides  consultant \nsupport to the Ministry of Transport and Communication (MTC) for the establishment of harbor \nusage  charges  based  on  broad-based  stakeholder  consultations.  Therefore,  the  Project \nmitigates  the  risk  of  introducing  unexpected  charges.  Harbor  usage  charges  are  to  be \nimplemented immediately after completion of construction. Preliminary analysis of harbor usage \ncharges estimates a lower charge than currently collected in Mal\u00e9 South West Harbor (in \naccordance with the FIRR calculation above) as being sufficient to cover capital investment and \nO&M  costs  at  Mal\u00e9  North  Harbor.  Impact  analysis  comparing  harbor  usage  charge  with \neconomic benefits also shows a net positive benefit to Mal\u00e9 North Harbor users. Demand risk is \nminimal because of the current capacity constraints. \n \n16.  Financial  risks  at  subproject  level  include  (i)  increase  in  prices  of  civil  works  and \nmaterials, particularly reclamation material; and (ii) delays in project implementation caused by \ncapacity  constraints.  These  risks  are  considered  low,  as  (i)  cost  estimates  include  higher \ncontingencies for dredging materials than normal; and (ii) project implementation support is \nbeing  provided  through  a  project  management  assistance  group  under  the  infrastructure \ninvestment consultant component.   \n \n ", "  Appendix 13         55 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \n \nA.

No \nContribution of the sector or subsector to reduce poverty in the Maldives: \n \nThe Project will contribute to ensuring sustained equitable and regionally balanced economic growth through \ninfrastructure improvements to the highest ranked infrastructure investment priority in the Seventh National \nDevelopment Plan (7NDP) supported by institutional and capacity building initiatives in the domestic maritime \ntransport sector.  \n \nThe Project will support the domestic maritime transport sector in the Maldives by (i) relieving congestion in the \nmost important interisland transport hub in the country, Mal\u00e9 North Harbor; and (ii) supporting the long-term \nsector  objectives  of  separating  policy,  planning,  and  regulatory  functions  from  operational  responsibilities \nthrough  the  institutional  development  and  capacity  building  component.  The  investment  and  institutional \ncomponents of the proposed loan are designed to contribute to the Government\u2019s objectives of ensuring \nsustained equitable and regionally balanced economic growth and will ensure increased opportunities for the \n70% of the Maldivian population residing in outer atolls to participate in economic activities in Mal\u00e9. By reducing \ntime spent in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, total transit time for travel between outer atolls and the capital will be reduced, \nand result in passenger and inventory cost savings as well as an increase of agricultural produce originating \nfrom outer islands in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor markets. The reduction of vessel turnaround time in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor \nwill lead to increased frequency of service and safer traveling conditions for the atoll community and thus benefit \nthe poorest section of the population. \nB.  Poverty Analysis   Targeting Classification: General intervention \n \nThe population of the Maldives is 298,842 (Census 2006). If those resident in Kaafu Atoll close to or excluded \nfrom Mal\u00e9 are not considered, approximately 70% of the population lives in \u201cthe atolls\u201d. The greatest incidence of \npoverty can be clearly seen to occur in the atolls.  \n \nThe Vulnerability and Poverty Assessment 2004 (VPA) shows that 5% (about 14,500 persons) of the atoll \npopulation can be considered to live in absolute poverty, with a daily income per person of Rf7.5 per day, \ncompared with 3% for the country as a whole and no incidence of poverty at this level in Mal\u00e9. A total of 28% of \nthe atoll population falls below the Rf15 per person per day poverty line, representing about 80,000 persons \nresident in the atolls according to the VPA data. The dispersed geography of the archipelago, combined with \nlimited resources for infrastructure development, contribute to the disparities in access to resources and in the \nlevels of vulnerability experienced at individual island level. The VPA analysis shows that this level of poverty is \nconcentrated in the north of the Maldives and decreases toward the south. This is reflected in the patterns of \naccess to transport services, although transport is not considered a key determinant of the move into or out of \npoverty.  \n \nA sample of nine islands was studied in the preparation of the Project. These islands ranged in size and distance \nfrom regional capitals, only two had average incomes over the Rf15 poverty line, with the regional capital \ndemonstrating an average income of Rf15.44\u2014on the poverty line. The travel demand and trends demonstrated \nby the sample islands were thus considered representative of those for the wider atoll population and a suitable \nbasis for analysis. The vulnerability ranking developed in the VPA assesses the vulnerability that arises from lack \nof access to social services, limited infrastructure (including transportation), and lack of access to resources for \nincome generation. For the 1997\u20131998 VPA, the disparities were found to be about 2:1 between the Maldives as \na whole and the atoll population. The disparities increased to 3:1 between Mal\u00e9 and the atoll with the lowest \naverage per capita income.  \n \nAny initiative that reduces the degree of disparity between the atoll community and Mal\u00e9 will reduce the VPA \ndisparities. Specifically, such improvements will have a positive benefit for the approximately 80,000 persons \nwho, in the above VPA analysis, are defined as \u201cincome-poor\u201d\u2014particularly those in remote locations with the \nmost limited transport services.  \n \n   ", "56  Appendix 13 \nImprovements to Mal\u00e9 North Harbor will have a significant positive benefit for vessel owners, passengers, and \ncargo owners served by vessels using this harbor, provided that the financial benefits from increased efficiency \nof operation and the resultant improved turnaround time outweigh the additional cost of harbor fees. Reduced \nturnaround time will reduce the costs per trip, by reducing the delays in Mal\u00e9, and will enable more trips per year \nto meet demand. \n \nC.  Participation Process \nIs there a stakeholder analysis?    Yes    No \n \nIs there a participation strategy?    Yes     No \n \nA stakeholder analysis was carried out and a participation plan was prepared in the project preparation stage. \nThese were reviewed and modified when necessary to ensure that all key stakeholders at central Government, \nlocal government, and community levels were identified. These groups or individuals were consulted at all \nstages of project preparation. \n \nThese consultations formed the basis of the social and poverty assessment in the initial stages. A 15% sample \nsurvey questionnaire as well as focus groups in each of nine islands included in the sample provided baseline \ndata on socioeconomic status, demand for transport services, and willingness and ability to pay for transport. In \nMal\u00e9, detailed interviews of 1\u20132 hours were carried out with owners and operators of all cargo or mixed cargo \nand passenger vessels in Mal\u00e9 North Harbor, and a detailed questionnaire was completed for each in a separate \nvisit. These consultations covered operating costs, transport routes, etc. A working meeting was convened, in \nwhich four larger-scale transport operators were asked to provide input to transport improvement options. In \nMal\u00e9, government and domestic transport stakeholders, along with directly affected business persons, were \ncontacted to obtain their assessment of the final project concept and to check for any design or general issues \nthat needed to be address before design was completed.   \n \nThe Government will ensure that essential participation of related stakeholders, particularly boat operators, will \nbe ensured and that stakeholders are consulted at detailed design review point, and then during construction in \norder to ensure that the design is fit for its purpose and that any negative construction impacts are minimized. \n \n \nD.  Gender Development \nStrategy to maximize impacts on women: \n \nThe consistent message from consultation with women was the key role that affordable and regular transport \nplayed in the life of the community, particularly for women. In all but two locations visited during public \nconsultation, cases were cited of death of pregnant women with complications, who could not get prompt access \nto better health services. The point was made that the lack of transport impacted most on those with low \nincomes who had limited cash available to hire private transport in cases of medical emergency. Although there \nwas some provision for the Government to cover this cost, there were some delays associated. Preventative \nhealth checks and health care was not possible for those in the lowest income quintile. \n \nDifficulty  of  access  was  another  key  issue  for  women  living  on  islands  with  no  jetty.  Rough  conditions, \nconstraints of female clothing, and the need to carry small infants or travel while pregnant, were all contributing \nfactors to increase the negative impacts of lack of access to transport infrastructure for women.   \n \nAs the Project is likely to enable higher frequency of transport opportunities, women are likely to experience \nproportionately greater benefits from the Project than men\u2014because of their relatively disadvantaged situation in \naccess to social services and economic resources resulting from insufficient transport infrastructure. \n \nHas an output been prepared?
