THE ENSUING PROGRAM \n \n1.   The government of Georgia has requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) provide \nsupport by lending for the proposed Georgia State Electrosystem (GSE) Corporatization and \nElectricity Market Reforms Program. \n \n2.  The  proposed  program  aims  to  strengthen  the  corporate  governance  and  financial \nmanagement of GSE (Georgia\u2019s electricity transmission company), and improve electricity market \ncompetition  by  supporting  an  independent  market  operator.  These  reforms  are  critical  to \nstrengthen  GSE\u2019s  corporate  governance,  financial  management,  transparency  and  debt \nsustainability; and to improve electricity market competition. The proposed policy-based loan will \nbe implemented during 2018\u20132019. The indicative loan amount for the program loan is $50 million \nfrom ordinary capital resources (regular). \n \nII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Justification \n \n3.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will help the government design and develop \nthe  capacity  to  implement  the  reform  program,  and  undertake  program  coordination  with \nstakeholders. The transaction TA is needed on the following grounds:1  \n(i)  program due diligence requires external expertise;  \n(ii)  although the government is committed to implementing reforms, there is a need to \nbuild stakeholders\u2019 implementation capacity; \n(iii)  external  expertise  is  needed  to  develop  and  support  implementation  of  the \ncorporate governance plan and debt management strategy; and  \n(iv)  to support donor coordination and stakeholder consultation. \n \nB.
