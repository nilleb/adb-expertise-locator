INTRODUCTION \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will build the business case and \ncapacity of Asian Development Bank (ADB) developing member countries (DMCs) to invest in \nnatural capital.1 The TA will support (i) analytical studies, including biophysical and economic \nassessments to identify and justify natural capital investments; (ii) preparation of investment \ncomponents of projects; (iii) strengthening of legal frameworks and enforcement mechanism for \nnatural  capital,  including  measures  to  address  the  illegal  wildlife  trade  (IWT);  and  (iv) \nstrengthening of knowledge and capacity for natural capital investments. Project selection will be \non a demand basis and consistent with the relevant DMC country partnership strategy and country \noperations business plan (COBP). The TA is consistent with ADB\u2019s Environment Operational \nDirections,2 and included in the work plan of ADB\u2019s Environment Thematic Group.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Asia and Pacific region is highly dependent on natural capital.4  An average of 30% \nof national wealth comes from natural capital;5 in the region, dependence varies widely (e.g., 85% \nin Bhutan, 39% in Viet Nam, and 19% in the Philippines). Revenue generation and employment \nfrom natural capital are also significant. For example, forests in Indonesia generate $21 billion per \nyear and support 3.7 million jobs. However, these values reflect only market prices for traded \ncommodities and fail to fully capture the economic value of ecosystem services, such as climate \nregulation, flood protection, erosion control, soil nutrient cycling, and water resource protection. \nThese are critical global public goods, but ecosystem services are also vital for the poor and \nvulnerable rural groups, who rely heavily on natural capital for their livelihoods\u2014in India, natural \ncapital provides up to 53% of the wealth of the poor.6  \n \n3.  The Asia and Pacific region is experiencing severe declines in natural capital that threaten \nto constrain future economic growth. For example, 25% of the land area in Asia and the Pacific \nwas considered degraded in 2008. The costs of this degradation can be high, and has been \nestimated to be as much as $255 billion in the People\u2019s Republic of China alone.7 Recent studies \nalso suggest that land degradation\u2014and particularly deforestation\u2014is linked to increasing flood \nrisks.8.Climate change will compound these impacts, with increasing flood risks expected to have \nsignificant economic and social impacts in Asia. For example, floods could cost countries in South \n                                                \n1  Natural capital refers to the stock of natural ecosystems and services, including (i) renewable natural ecosystems \nand resources (e.g., forests, water and agricultural farmland); (ii) non-renewable resources (e.g., minerals and fossil \nfuels); and (iii) ecosystem services such as provisioning services (e.g., raw materials), supporting services (e.g., \nnutrient recycling), regulating services (e.g., climate regulation), and cultural services (e.g., recreational, spiritual, \nand research values). \n2  ADB. 2013.

Increasing pressure on natural capital is driven by a range of factors, including agriculture \nexpansion, urbanization, infrastructure development, and poaching. For example, roads and \nhighways\u2014which are intended to improve connectivity and trade\u2014often lead to habitat loss and \nerosion,10 while the illegal trade in wildlife and forest products threatens the long-term survival of \nnumerous species and ecosystems. Impacts can be far reaching, because species losses can \nhave cascading effects. The loss of keystone species such as top predators can lead to a \nproliferation of invasive species, which can in turn lead to altered ecosystem functions. Increased \ntrade also undermines other natural capital investments, such as opportunities for ecotourism or \nthe development of markets for local forest product commodities. Globally, the economic value of \nthe IWT is estimated at $7 billion to $23 billion per year. This is driven by rising demand for wildlife \nproducts, particularly in east and southeast Asia.11 Rural poverty, weak law enforcement, and \ncorruption are major contributing factors.  \n \n5.  The  continuing  decline  in  natural  capital  suggests  that  current  investments  are  not \nsufficient to cover deficits caused by unsustainable use and degradation of natural capital. \nProtection and restoration of natural capital stocks to maintain ecosystem services is a key \nchallenge for DMCs. The private sector needs to increase its investment to address natural capital \nimpacts and dependencies, including risks to supply chains. Growing consumer demand for green \nproducts  provides  further  stimulus  to  adopt  more  sustainable  business  practices.  Potential \ninvestment areas include (i) sustainable land management, to restore the productive potential of \nsoils and increase agricultural yields; (ii) sustainable forest management and forest restoration to \nprovide timber resources while supporting climate change mitigation; (iii) protection of wetlands \nand watersheds to ensure freshwater supplies and climate resilience; (iv) management of coastal \nand marine resources to enhance food security while protecting coastal communities; and (v) \nmanagement  of  urban  ecosystems  for  flood  management  and  climate  resilience.  Such \ninvestments can deliver multiple benefits. For example, restoring a degraded peatland can \nimprove the quantity of water supplies while also reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Healthy \necosystems can also reduce climate risks\u2014wetlands and watersheds protect water quality while \nproviding natural protection against downstream floods, while coral reefs and mangrove forests \nin coastal areas serve to buffer storm surges. \n \n6.  Most  DMCs  have  made  international  commitments  and  developed  actions  plans  to \naddress natural capital loss.12 National legal frameworks are often well developed, but there are \ngaps in terms of integrating ecosystem services and addressing wildlife crime. Implementation \ncapacity is a key constraint. Investments also tend to be limited in scale, as financing is mostly \nsourced from grants and national budgets. Helping DMCs address these challenges will require \nsupport to (i) fill information and knowledge gaps on natural capital impacts and dependencies in \nkey sectors through more detailed assessments; (ii) identify natural capital investment options \nthat can generate sound economic and financial returns; (iii) develop knowledge regarding new \ninvestment areas and practices; and (iv) further strengthen legal frameworks, so that the IWT \ndoes not undermine other natural capital investment opportunities. \n                                                \n9  World Resources Institute. 2015.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: Natural capital assets of DMCs improved. The \nTA will have the following outcome: Commitment of DMCs to invest in natural capital increased.13 \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n8.  Output 1: Business case for natural capital investments established. The TA will \nprovide demand-driven support to DMCs to undertake analytical studies to inform the preparation \nof investments in the protection, management or sustainable use of natural capital. The TA will \nundertake at least five studies linked to ADB-supported projects in five DMCs. The studies will be \ndesigned to support investments under output 2. The studies will include biophysical assessments \nof natural capital stocks and ecosystem services, climate change risks, and socioeconomic \ndevelopment trends. Assessments will integrate the use of high-level technologies, including earth \nobservation and drones. Collaboration opportunities with the European Space Agency will be \nexplored to support a small-scale demonstration on the use of spatial assessment technologies \nand tools. Investment options will be assessed, including through economic and financial analysis. \nOpportunities for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and co-benefits such as biodiversity \nprotection, will be considered.  \n \n9.  Output 2: Investments in natural capital prepared. Linked to output 1, the TA will \nsupport DMCs in preparing at least five investments or investment components related to natural \ncapital management. Support will be linked to projects and TA in ADB COBPs. Areas of focus will \ninclude (i) sustainable forest, land, and water management; (ii) sustainable agribusiness; (iii) \nurban water and flood management; (iv) coastal protection; and (v) infrastructure designs that \nintegrate measures to protect natural habitats and biodiversity.
