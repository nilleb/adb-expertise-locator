Macroeconomic context. Bhutan achieved 5.9% annual gross domestic product growth \non average during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2013\u20132018), principally contributed by the \nhydropower and tourism sectors. However, tourism was one of the most adversely affected \nsectors  during  this  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  pandemic.  Owing  to  the  prolonged \ncommunity quarantines, travel restrictions, and other pandemic-related disruptions, Bhutan\u2019s \ngross domestic product is estimated to contract by 3.4% in FY2021.1 The youth (aged 15 to 24 \nyears) were among the hardest hit. Unemployment rate in this group almost doubled to 22.6% in \n2020 from 11.9% in 2019, a record high for the country.2 Youth unemployment was higher among \nfemales (25.4%) than in males (19.2%) in 2020. COVID-19 pandemic was the reason for losing \njobs among unemployed youth. \n \n2.  Education sector performance. Bhutan made remarkable progress in certain areas of \nits education system over the past decade The number of out-of-school children in the country \ndropped from 11,078 in 2011 to 3,252 in 2020.3 The gross enrollment rate for secondary \neducation increased from 67.3% in 2011 to 90.1% in 2018. While gross enrollment rate in tertiary \neducation is still limited, it has increased from 8.9% in 2011 to 16.4% in 2020. However, \nenrollment in technical and vocational education and training (TVET) saw minimal growth from \n6.8% in 2014 to 7.5% in 2018. Bhutan was forced to close schools from 18 March 2020 owing to \nthe pandemic and the government reopened schools gradually in February 2021 with some \nexceptions in the Southern part near the border with India.4 There is a concern that some of the \nprogress made by Bhutan in the education sector prior to the pandemic may get reversed. The \nadverse impact of the pandemic for the education sector, especially with respect to worsening of \nlearning outcomes and rise in youth unemployment, need close monitoring. In addition, the sector \nneeds further reforms to address challenges and demands of the 21st century given the fast-\nchanging technologies. Relevant jobs and economic opportunities also need to be created, \nbuilding on a strong human capital base, and driven by innovation and economic diversification.  \n \n3.  Skills development performance. The country\u2019s narrow economic base together with \ninadequate skills and lack of experience makes the youth vulnerable to external shocks. An \nestimated 110,000 Bhutanese youth will enter the labor market from 2016 to 2026. Equipping \nthem with emerging skills is critical to strengthen resilience and increase competency. With a \nrelatively high job placement rate of 76% for TVET graduates during 2003\u20132018,5 TVET has a \ncritical role to play, including for developing Bhutan\u2019s private sector. Labor market demand has \nbeen weak during the pandemic, but some industries such as construction urgently need national \nskilled workers because foreign skilled workers returned to their home countries. TVET graduates \nare much needed, not only for addressing current COVID-19 impacts, but also for developing a \ncritical mass of technicians and professionals for the future. However, TVET faces challenges of \nlow  enrollment  and  inadequate  capacity  of  instructors.  Pathways for career  and  academic \n \n1  Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2021.

The social stigma attached to TVET demotivates the youth to take up \nskills development courses. Stereotyping and social norms regarding the types of jobs which are \nappropriate for women also distorts their career choices and the types of courses they enroll for. \n \n4.  Government policies and strategy. The government has accorded the highest priority \nto  investing  in  TVET.  The  TVET  Blueprint  (2016\u20132026)  was  developed  to  provide  a \ncomprehensive  and  coherent  framework  for responding  to  the  challenges  in  TVET  and  to \nstrengthen its image, programs, accessibility, relevance, and quality.6 In addition, the Ministry of \nLabour and Human Resources (MOLHR) prepared the TVET reform strategic plan for revamping \nthe TVET system through the transformation of people, place, product, and process to produce a \ncompetent workforce that is confident, well-rounded, productive, resilient, and innovative.7 The \nreform plan was approved by the cabinet in August 2021 and is aligned with the discussions \nrelated to economic road map for the 21st century, which emphasized the need for a skilled labor \nforce for emerging sectors such as information technology, construction and renewable energy, \nwith the enhanced use of digital technology. Of the estimated 12,000 students from higher \nsecondary schools projected to graduate every year, more than 30% are expected to participate \nin skills development through TVET to contribute to national economic priorities. \n \n5.  Asian Development Bank assistance. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has been a \nlong-term partner for Bhutan in skills development. It has been working closely with MOLHR.8 \nLessons  from  the  completed  Basic  Skills  Development  Project  (2001\u20132006)  include  the \nimportance  of  proper  sequencing  of  activities,  good  and  comprehensive  project  design, \ninstitutional  leadership,  continuity  of  project  management  staff,  and  comprehensive \nunderstanding  of  sector  issues. 9  The  ongoing  Skills  Training  and  Education  Pathways \nUpgradation Project (STEPUP) has incorporated some of these aspects in its design. The \ngovernment has requested ADB to ramp up its support for the implementation of the TVET reform \nstrategic plan by financing the proposed Pathways for Emerging Skills and Jobs Project in 2021 \n($30 million concessional loan), and the Strengthening Institutional Capacity for Innovation and \nDigital Transformation Project in 2023 ($30 million concessional loan). \n \n6.  The government appreciated the design and implementation of ADB\u2019s ongoing technical \nassistance (TA) for skills development,10 which provided quality technical inputs for project \npreparation and administration by funding international and national experts and a professional \n \n6   Ministry of Labour and Human Resources. 2016.

As the TA is scheduled to close on 15 December 2021, the government requested a \nsimilar TA support for processing new projects and continuing the assistance for implementation \nof STEPUP. Key lessons can be drawn from the current TA implementation. First, ADB TA can \nadd  value  by  developing  new  curricula  and  providing  procurement  support  to  purchase \nappropriate goods and equipment to deliver certified skills development courses in Bhutan. \nSecond, it is important to share global practices and innovative approaches for skills development \nsuch as online courses available during the COVID-19 pandemic. The ADB TA can facilitate \nadoption of current and emerging technologies by connecting relevant stakeholders. \n \n7.  Rationale for a transaction technical assistance facility. The proposed transaction TA \nfacility will support project preparation, capacity development, due diligence, and improved \nreadiness for pipeline education and skills development projects over the period, 2021 to 2023 \nincluded in the country operations business plan,11 as agreed with the government during the TA \nfacility\u2019s  timeframe.  It  will  also  support  the  MOLHR  and  Ministry  of  Education  in  the \nimplementation of the ongoing STEPUP.12 The TA facility is aligned with (i) ADB\u2019s Strategy \n2030,13 (ii) TVET Blueprint 2016\u20132026 (footnote 6), (iii) TVET reform strategic plan, and (iv) \nSustainable Development Goals (SDG), particularly with SDG 4 (ensure inclusive and equitable \nquality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all), SDG 8 (decent work and \neconomic growth), and SDG 10 (reduced inequalities). The TA facility is included in the country \noperations  business  plan  for  Bhutan,  2021\u20132023,  with  the  title,  Preparing  Transformative \nApproaches to Skills Development Project (TVET). \n \n8.  The TA facility will support strategic policy advisory and technical inputs on a range of \neducation and skills development issues, strategy and operational plan development, feasibility \nstudy preparations including assessment of financial management and procurement systems, \ncurriculum, pedagogy, evaluation, and competency standards, as well as economic and financial \nanalysis. It will also develop the capacity of executing and implementing agencies by sharing \ninternational good practices and fostering innovation. In particular, the TA facility will bring \ninternational expertise not available in-country such as in: (i) designing curriculum on emerging \nskills areas; (ii) developing pedagogy for blended learning; (iii) strengthening TVET-industry \nlinkages; and (iv) building the capacity of TVET instructors. The TA facility approach is suitable \nas it will enhance project preparation efficiency and project implementation readiness for two \neducation and skills development projects in the Bhutan pipeline by: (i) allowing the same experts \nto be mobilized for similar due diligence activities; (ii) facilitating learning on project processing \nand  implementation  across  different  projects;  (iii)  improving  knowledge  transfer;  and  (iv) \nstrengthening coordination and tapping synergies across various technical inputs and capacity \nbuilding efforts. Overall, this TA facility will reduce transaction costs as compared to allocating \nresources for separate stand-alone transaction TA projects. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n9.  Output 1: Strengthened capacity to implement skills development reform. This \noutput will support the implementation of the government\u2019s TVET reform strategic plan through \nongoing and future ADB-funded education and skills development projects. Building on the \nanalyses conducted under the TVET strategic plan, the TA will help MOLHR prepare a TVET \ninvestment road map which will inform phased investment through ongoing and future ADB-\n \n11 ADB. 2020.

The investment roadmap analyzes (i) the changing skills demanded by the \nindustry; (ii) youth aspirations in terms of careers and skills; (iii) additional requirements such as \ninstructors, cost, and time; and (iv) international best practices on TVET policies, governance, \nand business processes, including COVID-19 responses. Based upon investment roadmap, the \nimplementation support aligned with TVET reform strategic plan is provided for ADB-funded \nprojects by (i) exploring international partnerships for emerging skills development; (ii) supporting \npathways among general education, TVET, and higher education; (iii) developing measures to \nsupport quality private training providers; and (iv) supporting monitoring and evaluation. \n \n10.  Output 2: Improved project design for skills development project. This output will \nsupport the preparation of new education and skills development projects for potential ADB \nfinancing. The scope of activities will include: (i) assessment of existing curricula, pedagogy, and \nevaluation; (ii) identification of new courses based on new technologies and emerging skills being \ndemanded by industry; (iii) preparation of curricula and competency standards for these new \ncourses; (iv) identification of training facilities and equipment to deliver upgraded or advanced \ncourses; (v) exploration of innovative education and skills development practices relevant for \nBhutan; (vi) development of design and monitoring frameworks for these projects; (vii) data \ncollection and analysis related to economic and financial due diligence; (viii) analyses on gender \nequity and social inclusion; (ix) environmental and social safeguard assessment; and (x) due \ndiligence on costing, financial management, procurement, and other institutional arrangements \nfor executing and implementing agencies. This output will also support projects to achieve \nreadiness through advance procurement activities, where required. \n \n11.  Output 3: Enhanced project management capacity for producing skilled graduates. \nThis output will provide implementation support for the ongoing STEPUP which is expected to \ncontinue until April 2024, since the current transaction TA supporting the project is scheduled to \nclose in December 2021. A survey firm will be recruited to conduct a tracer study and employer \nsurvey  for  assessing  the  achievements  of  STEPUP  based  on  the  design  and  monitoring \nframework indicators. The survey assessment results will also be used for setting baselines and \ninforming  policy  discussions  for  future  education  and  skills  development  projects  such  as \nPathways for Emerging Skills and Jobs Project and Strengthening Institutional Capacity for \nInnovation and Digital Transformation Project. The individual consultants to be engaged will \nsupport STEPUP in facilitation and monitoring of (i) procurement, (ii) disbursement, (iii) timely \nsubmission  of  audited  project  financial  statement,  (iv)  environmental  and  social  safeguard \nmeasures, (v) gender action plan, (vi) student mentoring support, and (vii) international and \nnational partnership. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA facility is estimated to cost $550,000, of which $500,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 7). The key expenditure items \nare listed in Appendix 1. The indicative consultants\u2019 input allocations by ongoing project (STEPUP) \nand  pipeline  projects  (Pathways  for  Emerging  Skills  and  Jobs  Project  and  Strengthening \nInstitutional Capacity for Innovation and Digital Transformation Project) are listed in Appendix 2. \nThe government will provide $50,000 counterpart support in the form of counterpart staff, office \nspace, office supplies, coordination assistance, and other in-kind contributions. The government \nwas informed that approval of the TA does not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project. \n \n ", "5 \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA and will undertake the selection, supervision, and evaluation \nof consultants. The executing and implementing agencies will provide counterpart support in the \nform of counterpart staff and other in-kind contributions.
