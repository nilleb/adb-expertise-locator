INTRODUCTION\n1. The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will finance diagnostics on the most\nsuitable education technology (edtech) interventions in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and\nViet Nam.1 It will identify the technology solutions that can be used based on each country\u2019s\nedtech readiness and test edtech interventions accordingly. The TA builds on an ongoing regional \nTA on innovation in education sector development in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and \nViet Nam2 that assessed the fourth industrial revolution\u2019s impact on labor markets by examining\ntwo economically important sectors in each country.3 The TA builds on one key lesson from the \nongoing regional TA: the need to leverage technology in training and skills development. As \ncountries invest in information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure to modernize \ntheir economy, there is a need to equip workers with digital skills increasingly in demand in the \nlabor market.4 The focus on the four countries, which have different ICT development and learning \noutcomes, will produce comprehensive and policy-relevant evidence on edtech. The need for \nknowledge and evidence on edtech is not new, but the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic \nhas provided the much-needed impetus to adopt technology-enabled innovation in education. \nThis TA will help the four countries as they recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and find ways \nto provide continued access to education by leveraging edtech. \n2. The TA is not in the current regional cooperation operations business plan. It is aligned\nwith the Operational Plan for Regional Cooperation and Integration, 2016\u20132020; the Greater\nMekong Subregion Economic Cooperation Program Strategic Framework, 2012\u20132022; and the\noperational plan for education, 2008\u20132020 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB).5\nII. ISSUES\n3. In Southeast Asia, school enrollment up to tertiary education has increased dramatically,\nbut improvement in learning outcomes has been less encouraging. In 2018, the World Bank\nreleased a report that described Southeast Asia\u2019s \u201clearning crisis,\u201d where learning outcomes are\nnot improving commensurately even though enrollment in schools is increasing and students are \nspending more years in school on average.6 Key factors of this discrepancy include unskilled and \nunmotivated  teachers,  unprepared  learners,  ineffective  school  inputs,  and  poor  school \nmanagement that does  not improve teaching and learning. Economic evidence from other \ndeveloping countries shows that edtech products can improve learning among students.7 \n1  The TA report uses \u201cedtech\u201d to refer to the use of digital and mobile technology in education and training.\n2  Asian Development Bank (ADB). Regional: Innovation in Education Sector Development in Asia and the Pacific. The \nfocus sectors are tourism and garments in Cambodia, automotives and food and beverage in Indonesia, business \nprocess outsourcing and electronics in the Philippines, and agro-processing and logistics in Viet Nam. \n3  The fourth industrial revolution represents a fundamental change in the way people live and work, underpinned by \nnew and more sophisticated technology.

There is renewed motivation to explore greater use\nof digital technology in the delivery of education and training, spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo maintain physical distancing and limit public gatherings to contain the spread of COVID-19,\nschools and training institutions in large parts of the world continue to remain closed.8 Delivery of\neducation and learning moved to the home for families with access to the internet and electronic\ndevices. For those without access to technology, the crisis underscored the importance of\ninvesting in ICT infrastructure. The pandemic has highlighted the digital divide and the challenge\nof  inequity  in  access  because  of  limited  ICT  infrastructure,  while  providing  an  impetus  to\ngovernments to overcome these barriers to ensure continued access to education across all\nincome groups. Living through the pandemic has highlighted the need for a greater use of edtech\nin teaching and learning.\n5. While edtech interventions are not new, there is a dearth of evidence on the products that\nwork in a developing country context.9 Although the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the adoption\nof technology across all education levels, this has been done as an emergency response to the\npandemic, without much long-term thinking and policy direction. Some of the major challenges in\nCambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam are the (i) limited use of digital technology in\nthe delivery of education and training, (ii) lack of diagnostics on whether edtech interventions\nimprove learning outcomes, (iii) limited knowledge sharing and awareness among national\nstakeholders, (iv) lack of partnerships between edtech providers and public education systems,\nand (v) limited number of edtech solutions tested and evaluated in Southeast Asia.\n6. Limited use of digital technology. Although edtech has often been hailed as a way for\ncountries to address some of their chronic challenges, such as poor-quality teaching and outdated\ncurriculum, it has not been used on a scale that will make a difference in learning and job\noutcomes. Governments were keen on edtech even before the pandemic, but there was a general\nlack of awareness about the available solutions. Despite increasing evidence from developed\ncountries on what works in edtech,10 low- and middle-income countries have significantly fewer\nedtech interventions.\n7. Lack of diagnostics. The edtech market in Asia and the Pacific is expected to grow to\n54% of global market share by the end of 2020.11 This projection was based on pre-pandemic\ntrends, and the edtech market is likely to grow even more. Cross-border collaboration between\nlocal and regional edtech companies to deliver content, curriculum, and services to new learners\nhas increased. However, impact evaluations of edtech interventions show that providing students\nand teachers with access to technology yields mixed results (footnote 10). This underscores the\nneed to carry out diagnostics to determine the edtech type with the greatest likelihood of success.\n8. Limited knowledge sharing and awareness among national stakeholders. Evidence\nshows that many interventions tend to be designed without inputs from educators and policy\nmakers. This problem is compounded by the limited knowledge sharing and awareness among\nnational stakeholders on technology-enabled solutions, contributing to the underuse of new\ntechnology. A key barrier to leveraging digital learning tools and harnessing learner data has been\nthe lack of formal partnerships between local and regional edtech firms and the public education\nsystem. This changed during the COVID-19 pandemic as more countries have become aware of\n8  At the height of the COVID-19 related lockdowns in May 2020, 1.2 billion learners were affected, which accounted \nfor more than two-thirds of all enrolled learners globally, due to 144 country-wide school closures (UNESCO). \n9  C.

Large underserved populations in Southeast Asia\nwould benefit from modernizing traditional education systems, which could lead to cost reduction\nand improved access. However, to achieve this at the scale that will make a tangible difference,\nedtech investments in Southeast Asia need to be accelerated. Because the edtech market is\nsupported by private firms that launch products without extensive consultations with national\nstakeholders, breakthroughs in technology and the digital space drive the types of products\nintroduced, not the actual challenges countries face in the sector.\nIII. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE\nA. Impact and Outcome\n10. The TA is aligned with the following impact: equitable and inclusive learning opportunities\nusing new and emerging edtech.12 The TA will have the following outcome: better knowledge and\nexpanded use of edtech products.13\nB. Outputs, Methods, and Activities\n11. Output 1: Edtech diagnostics in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam\nconducted and disseminated. ADB will engage an international research firm to conduct the\ndiagnostics of edtech interventions in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam.\nDiagnostics work will use the World Bank\u2019s global edtech readiness index framework, which has\nfour main dimensions: infrastructure, content, policy and institutions, and skills.14 The diagnostics\nwill also examine edtech\u2019s role in addressing gender disparity in education outcomes, while\naccounting for heterogeneity in schools and education systems. The firm will disseminate the \nfindings through knowledge events as part of broader efforts to raise awareness on edtech \nsolutions. \n12. Output 2: Edtech interventions in the four countries tested. In preparation for the\npotential edtech interventions in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam, this output\nwill include consultations with the four governments and relevant national stakeholders working\nin education. Under this output, the design of edtech interventions will be aligned with government\npriorities and the assessments carried out under output 1. The design and implementation of the\nedtech interventions will consider the gender disparities in access to ICT and learning outcomes.\nOnce there is clear buy-in from the four governments, at least one edtech intervention will be\nimplemented in each country by school year 2021\u20132022.\n13. Output 3: Impact of the edtech interventions evaluated. An international firm will be\nengaged under the TA to conduct rigorous evaluation of the interventions in Cambodia, Indonesia,\nthe Philippines, and Viet Nam. The firm will design the baseline and end-line surveys and will\nconduct an empirical evaluation to gauge the impact and effectiveness of the edtech solutions in\nimproving learning outcomes. The findings of the impact evaluations will be disseminated to policy\nmakers in knowledge forums, policy briefs, and a synthesis report. The findings from the edtech\n12 United Nations. 2015.

Output 4: Support for scaling up edtech interventions in the four countries provided.\nTechnology is constantly evolving and creating possibilities in edtech. To generate long-term and\nsustained solutions from the TA, this output will facilitate increased investment in and support for\nthe edtech ecosystem in Cambodia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Viet Nam. This will help\nedtech providers leverage cloud-based ICT infrastructure to ensure agility and scalability while\nadhering to international standards on digital infrastructure and data security. This output will\nprovide technology consultancy and prepare modernization road maps for the solutions that will\nemerge from output 2. It will also contribute to the development of a regional standard and policy\ntoward edtech adoption.\nC. Cost and Financing\n15. The TA is estimated to cost $2,000,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by the\nJapan Fund for Poverty Reduction (JFPR) and administered by ADB. The key expenditure items\nare listed in Appendix 2.\n16. Following JFPR guidelines, the estimate covers (i) consultant services; (ii) the direct cost\nof TA implementation, including regional and local travel, monitoring and reporting, and support\nfor knowledge product development; (iii) workshops, seminars, training programs, and country\nworking group meetings; (iv) regional conferences and forums; (v) training programs on scaling\nup edtech interventions; (vi) goods, such as computer software packages and licensing fees for\nedtech products; and (vii) surveys.\nD. Implementation Arrangements\n17. ADB will administer the TA. The Human and Social Development Division of ADB\u2019s\nSoutheast Asia Department, in consultation with the resident missions, will select, supervise, and \nevaluate the performance of consultants. The firm selected to test the edtech products will carry \nout the edtech interventions and handle the procurement of software licenses and fees to access \nedtech platforms using ADB\u2019s request for quotations procedure.
