Tajikistan is in the process of developing a 10-year national development strategy (NDS) \nand a medium-term poverty reduction strategy (PRS). This process provides a unique entry \npoint for strengthening the results management capacities of the Government.  Developing and \nimplementing a realistic, useful, and coherent results management system is a major priority of \nthe Government, and is of paramount importance in guiding the formulation of policies and \nfocused investment programs to respond to the country's development needs. At the request of \nthe Government, technical assistance (TA) for results management capacity development in \nsupport of poverty reduction in Tajikistan was included in the 2006 TA program of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \n2.   With ADB assistance, a consortium of donors\u2014including ADB, European Commission \n(EC),  Swedish  International  Development  Agency  (Sida),  and  Department  for  International \nDevelopment  of  the  United  Kingdom  (DFID)\u2014was  formed  to  design  this  TA and  help  the \nGovernment to build its capacity for monitoring and evaluation at central, sectoral, and local \nlevels. The joint ADB, Sida, DFID, and EC Fact-Finding Mission (the Mission)1 in August 2006 \nconcluded an understanding with the Government on the impact, outcomes, outputs, approach, \ncost estimates, implementation arrangements, and terms of reference of the TA. During the \nMission, the sequencing of the assistance by the donors was also agreed. Sida agreed to co-\nfinance the ADB-administered TA on enhancing the results management aspects of the PRS. In \nparallel, the EC will administer a complementary project focused on implementation and pilot \ntesting in one or two specific sectors. The TA is also closely aligned with other donor projects \nrelated to the development of results agenda in Tajikistan.2\n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Tajikistan is developing a 10-year NDS for achieving the Millennium Development Goals \n(MDGs). The 3-year PRS is being prepared as a medium-term business plan within the vision \nset out in the NDS. The PRS identifies the main directions and measures aimed at reducing \npoverty  in  Tajikistan  for  2007\u20132009.  It  also  sets  out  a  policy  matrix  that  identifies  output \nindicators, sources of financing, and responsible agencies. \n \n4.  The  Government  has  undertaken  structural  reforms  that  lay  a  solid  foundation  for \nresults-based  monitoring.  These  reforms  include  streamlining  government  structure  and \ndecentralizing power to line ministries and local governments that make public administration \nmore results-focused. Interlinked components of the Government's public administration reform \nagenda include: (i) preparation of the NDS and PRS, (ii) formulation and implementation of \nMediumTerm  Expenditure  Framework  (MTEF),  (iii)  reorganization  of  key  ministries  and \nagencies, and (iv) strengthening the State Financial Control Committee and National Statistical \nSystems. \n \n                                                 \n1  The Mission comprised Zafardjon Khotamov, Economics Officer, Tajikistan Resident Mission (TJRM) (Mission \nLeader), Neeraj Jain, Country Director, TJRM, and Per Oyvind Bastoe, Principal Results Management Specialist, \nStrategy and Policy Department (SPD) (mission members). Members from other donor agencies included: Barbara \nPlinkert, EC; Jean-Bernard De Milito, EC; Maria Lagus, Sida; Ilhom Akobirshoev, Sida, and Shahlo Rahimova, \nDFID. \n2  The Government is assisted by donors to (i) build its capacity to implement the Medium-Term Expenditure \nFramework (MTEF); (ii) build the capacity of the State Financial Control Committee in analyzing the draft revenue \nand expenditure parts of the budget and identify deviations from the indicators of the budget; and (iii) build the \ncapacity of the State Statistical Committee (SSC) to collect poverty-related data.  \n ", "2   \n5.  The State Statistical Committee (SSC) is responsible for compilation and reporting of \nstatistical  information.  It  disseminates  such  information  to  users  through  regular  reports, \nbooklets, and its website. However, some of the information lacks relevance for monitoring \nimplementation  of  the  PRS  in  the  context  of  the  MDGs.  In  particular,  the  poverty  and \ndevelopment  indicators  are  collected  on  an  ad  hoc  basis\u2014not  regularly\u2014through  surveys \nfunded and assisted by donors. This is mainly because of weak methodological skills inherited \nfrom the Soviet system, which are not geared to supporting the private sector based orientation \nof the emerging Tajikistan. Currently, only limited data is available on the sub-oblast (district) \nlevel  for  poverty  monitoring.  The  Tajikistan  Living  Standard  Survey  20033  was  the  latest \ncomprehensive poverty related data collection that spurred analysis and policy adjustments by \nthe Government, including rising spending in the social sector. \n \n6.   Comprehensive donor assistance is already being provided to the SSC to strengthen its \ncapacity and to realign data collection activities, which contribute to an enabling environment for \nimplementation of the TA. The World Bank started a TA on 1 June 2006 (amounting to $5 million) \non Strengthening the National Statistical Systems for Development and Poverty Reduction, \nwhich will improve the capacity of the SSC to collect poverty related data. ADB has included \nTajikistan in the assessment phase of its regional TA on Statistical Capacity Building in the Asia \nand Pacific Region4.  \n \n7.  A comprehensive results management system usually includes all levels of government: \ncentral ministries and agencies, and regional and local governments. At each level, results \nmanagement includes three broad stages: (i) clarifying objectives, (ii) monitoring of output and \noutcomes, and (iii) feedback and use of the monitoring information to improve learning and \ndecision making. At present, the results management systems are fragmented, with too many \nindicators; and the PRS progress reports are analytically weak and lack key development \nindicators. A fully developed results management system covers not only the NDS and PRS but \nall aspects of the Government, including transparency and accountability of public expenditure. \n \n8.  The institutional setting for results management in Tajikistan is fragmented among the \nPresident's  Office,  ministries,  and  agencies,  Links  between  planning,  budgeting,  and \nimplementation are weak. The processes are not clearly understood at the service delivery \nlevel. Budgeting is also fragmented, with budgeting for capital and current expenditures done \nseparately.5 However, ongoing reforms to address some of these weaknesses, together with the \nTA, aim to help develop a comprehensive results management system. \n \n9.   The confused and fragmented responsibilities for monitoring national development plans \nand programs are being addressed generally under the Public Administration Reform Strategy. \nFunctional duplications remain, although they have been reduced significantly. The strategy \ngives the Ministry of Economy and Trade (MOET) responsibilities for formulation of national \ndevelopment plans, significantly enabling it to potentially play a major role in managing the PRS \nfor results. It is necessary to strengthen the capacity of MOET and reorient the current \"control\"-\nbased approach to a results-based approach to fulfill these responsibilities in a better manner. \n \n10.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) leads preparation and implementation of the budget. The \nbudget  process,  including  its  monitoring,  is  increasingly  becoming  effective  as  a  result  of \nimplementation  of  a  series  of  reforms.  These  reforms  include  (i)  new  State  Finance  Law \n                                                 \n3 World Bank. 2003. Tajikistan Living Standards Survey. Washington, D.C. \n4 ADB. 2006.

", "  3\nenacted in 2002, (ii) the new national treasury, (iii) treasury single account, (iv) establishment of \nthe cash management unit, and (v) creation of the State Financial Control Committee. More \nrecently, the Government has opted for an MTEF being developed over several years, preceded \nby a preparatory phase to be carried out during 2006\u20132007. \n \n11.  Institutionalization of the MTEF also depends on the progress and outcomes of ongoing \npublic administration reform, especially the structure of the public administration, including a \nclear division of resources and responsibility between central and local governments.6 A sector-\nbased MTEF has important implications for local governments, which should channel budget \nsubmissions through relevant lead line ministries instead of dealing directly with MOF. The lead \nline ministries will ensure that: (i) these submissions conform to sector expenditure priorities and \nceilings, and (ii) republican key budget organization budgets are consistent with sector priorities. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n12.  The  TA  aims  to  improve  results  management  capacity  in  central  parts  of  the \nGovernment,  specifically  at  the  President's  Office,  MOET,  and  MOF.  The  main  intended \noutcome of the TA is that the Government, donors, and other stakeholder perceive as useful the \nadopted PRS results and monitoring framework and the results management systems related to \nthe  framework.  This  will  have  the  following  benefits:  (i)  clarifying  objectives  and  priorities; \n(ii) creating  feedback  loops  to  policy  formulation,  resource  allocation,  and  operations; \n(iii) achieving  greater  efficiency,  effectiveness,  and  accountability  in  the  socioeconomic \ndevelopment of Tajikistan; and (iv) making the PRS a powerful tool for planning and monitoring \ndevelopment assistance to Tajikistan through greater country ownership and donor coordination, \nas  envisaged  in  Paris  Declaration  on  Aid  Effectiveness.  ADB  and  other  key  donors  are \nconsidering  the  formulation  of  a  joint  country  strategy  for  Tajikistan  in  line  with  the  Paris \nDeclaration. A PRS with a systematic results and monitoring framework would greatly facilitate a \njoint donor strategy and provide a solid foundation for donor coordination.   \n \n13.  The expected outputs of the TA include: (i) assessment of the results management \ncapacity of the central Government, (ii) design of a complete PRS results and monitoring \nframework, (iii) application and testing of the PRS results framework in central parts of the \nGovernment, and (iv) assessment of the initial application of the framework and proposal of \nrefinements based on the assessment. To sustain the capacity developed, the TA also includes \nappropriate training programs and related workshops and seminars to improve the results \nmanagement capacity (data collection, processing, and analysis) of concerned government \nofficials from the Executive Office of the President, MOET, PRSP Monitoring Unit, MOF, Aid \nCoordination  Unit,  and  line  ministries.  The  outputs  will  be  delivered  in  four  phases,  with \nimplementation as detailed in Appendix 2. \n \n                                                 \n6  At present, the Government is centralized. However, with the Public Administration Strategy, it is anticipated that \n(i) the  effectiveness  of  the  development  of  national  management  will  be  increased,  and  (ii)  decentralized \nadministrative and territorial management will be developed. Within the short term (i.e., up to the end of 2006), it is \nexpected that functional reviews at all levels of local government will identify duplicated functions and gaps. In the \nmedium term (2007\u20132008), it is expected that the Government will start to implement the recommendations of the \nfunctional reviews.      \n ", "4   \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n14.   Assessment and Capacity Building. Systematic assessment of the current results \nmanagement  capacity  of  the  Government  at  the  central  level  uses  strength,  weakness, \nopportunity, threat (SWOT) analysis of the environment, culture, systems, and capacities of \nresults  management\u2014in  particular,  analyzing  leadership  and  management  practices  for \nplanning, budgeting, implementing, and monitoring activities for MOET, PRSP Monitoring Unit, \nMOF, and Aid Coordination Unit. It will also include capacity building activities, including a \nworkshop  with  key  government  decision  makers,  to  ensure  a  common  understanding  and \napproach.  Preparation  of  a  glossary  of  results-based  management  terms  in  the  Russian \nlanguage will be incorporated to improve wider understanding of the terminology and guidelines \nin Tajikistan, and can also be used in other Central Asian Republics.   \n \n15.   Design  of  Results  Management  System.  Design  of  a  comprehensive  results \nmanagement system will be related to the PRS. It will include: (i) design of a first generation \ncomprehensive  results  management  system,  including  an  acceptable  set  of  realistic  and \nmeasurable indicators for monitoring and evaluation of results of the PRS;7 (ii) systems to \nmonitor those indicators; (iii) processes for feedback and use of the monitoring information for \nlearning and decision making; and (iv) capacity building activities, including a workshop with key \nmanagers.  \n \n16.   Implementation  of  the  System.  The third output will implement the system at the \nnational level of government to test its usefulness. It will include capacity building activities, \nincluding on-the-job and in-house training for government officials.    \n \n17.  Assessment  and  Refinement  of  the  System.  This will be an  assessment of the \nimplementation of the System that will lead to the proposal for further refinement of the various \nelements of the system. Capacity building activities, including workshops and seminars, will be \nan important part of this. \n \n18.   A  separate  stand-alone  TA,  administered  and  financed  by  the  EC  (amounting  to \n\u20ac700,000), will pilot test the system developed by the TA in one or two sectors, including the \nregional level. It will follow the same sequencing of activities as the TA in the two sectors (health \nand  education).  It  will  be  a  close  collaboration  between  the  two  TAs  to  ensure  common \nterminology  and  approaches.  Broad  participation  from  all  relevant  stakeholders  will  be  an \nimportant part of the methodology. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n19.   The estimated TA cost is $1,000,000 equivalent, of which $400,000 will be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Cooperation Fund in Support of Managing for Development Results, and \n$500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Sweden. ADB will administer \nthe contributions from the Cooperation Fund in Support of Managing for Development Results \nand the Government of Sweden. The Government will contribute the balance of $100,000 \nequivalent in kind by providing office accommodation, transport, remuneration and per diem of \ncounterpart government staff. TA costs and the financing plan are in Appendix 3.   \n \n                                                 \n7  Complying with specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) criteria. ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n20.  MOET will be the Executing Agency (EA) of the ADB-administered TA under the overall \ncoordination of the President\u2019s Office of the Republic of Tajikistan. The TA will be implemented \nby a team of individual consultants. The consulting input will comprise 24 person-months of \ninternational  and  78 person-months  of  national  consultants.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants are in Appendix 4. ADB will engage the consultants (both national and international) \non an individual basis in accordance with its Guidelines on the Use of Consultants. Equipment \nunder the TA will be procured by ADB in accordance with its Procurement Guidelines and will \nbe transferred to the EA upon completion of the TA. The TA is estimated to start in March 2007 \nand be completed in March 2009. The consultants will be located at MOET and will work under \nthe supervision of ADB in close coordination with the Government. Detailed implementation \narrangements are in Appendix 2. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S  DECISION \n21.       The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) ADB \nadministering a portion of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $400,000 to be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund in Support of Managing for Development \nResults,  and  (ii)  ADB  administering  a  portion  of  technical  assistance  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent of $500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Government of Sweden, to the \nGovernment  of  Tajikistan  for  Strengthening  Results  Management  in  Support  of  poverty \nreduction in Tajikistan, and hereby reports this action to the Board.  \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       Assumption \n(10-year perspective)      \u2022  Achieving the intended \n      impact requires successful \nImproved results  Indicator: Quality and  Donor governance  TA and follow-up activities \nmanagement capacity in  use of results and  assessment and/or results  and stability among key \ncentral parts of the  monitoring frameworks   management capacity  people in the Government \nGovernment of Tajikistan  Target: Useful results  assessment \nand monitoring \nframeworks in all major \ngovernment plans \nOutcomes       Assumption \n(3\u20135 year perspective)      \u2022  Achieving these outcomes \n      requires successful TA \nThe adopted PRS results  Indicators/targets:  (i) Government PRS  and acceptance by all \nand monitoring  (i) Active use of the PRS  progress reports  major stakeholders. \nframework and the  results and monitoring  (ii) Monitoring and  Participatory processes \nresults management  framework by the  Evaluation  section of the  and active collaborative \nsystems related to the  Government   next ADB Tajik Country  efforts will be made to \nframework is perceived  (ii) Use of the PRS  Strategy and Program, and  ensure this. \nas useful by key  results and monitoring  other donors' country  Risk \nstakeholders and donors  framework by the  strategies  \u2022  Results management \nin Tajikistan  majority of donors    is a new concept and \n  the stakeholders in the \n  Government may be \n  slow to adopt it. \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n      \u2022  Delivery of these outputs \n1.
