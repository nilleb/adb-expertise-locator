INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) will provide capacity building and \npolicy advice to support the introduction of market mechanisms for electricity sales and purchases \nin Pakistan based on the competitive trading bilateral contract model (CTBCM), developed under \nTA for Strengthening the Central Power Purchasing Agency.1 The introduction of competition in \nthe electricity subsector will support the energy sector\u2019s financial sustainability in the long run \nthrough mechanisms that will remain effective despite political changes. This TA is included in \nthe Asian Development Bank (ADB) country operations business plan 2019-2021 for Pakistan.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n2.  Pakistan\u2019s electricity subsector has been running under an unbundled structure since \n2002. Public generation companies (GENCOs) and independent power producers (IPPs) sell \nelectricity to the subsector\u2019s single buyer, the Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) \nLimited (CPPA-G), based on long-term power purchase agreements. The Water and Power \nDevelopment  Authority  (WAPDA)  owns  and  operates  most  large  hydro  power  plants  and \ncontributes about 30% of generated electricity annually. Transmission is handled by the 100% \nstate-owned  National  Transmission  and  Despatch  Company  (NTDC).  Ten  regional  power \ndistribution companies (DISCOs) supply electricity to all types of customers. All these DISCOs \nare 100% state-owned except for K-Electric, a privatized vertically integrated electricity utility \ncompany in the Karachi region. The total installed generation capacity, excluding the privatized \nK-Electric system, is about 26,186 megawatts (MW), and the system peak demand in 2017 was \n25,117 MW. The K-Electric system had total installed capacity of 2,213 MW and the peak demand \nof 3,359 MW in 2017. Including K-Electric, 120 terawatt hour (TWh) of electricity was generated \nin 2017.3 \n \n3.  Pakistan\u2019s electricity subsector is suffering from a chronic shortage of cash. This is largely \nattributable  to  tariff  levels,  collections  and  system  losses  (including  both  technical  and \ncommercial), which have led to the inability of DISCOs to provide required payments to CPPA-G. \nIn turn, the CPPA-G only has cash for partial payment of electricity supplied by GENCOs, IPPs, \nWAPDA and some fuel suppliers. The accrued delayed payment to these entities, generally \nreferred to as circular debt, was about PRs500 billion when the previous government came to \npower in 2013. With an initial clearance of PRs480 billion and subsequent efforts to limit new \naccumulation, circular debt gradually grew to about PRs700 billion by mid-2017,4 however, it \nincreased rapidly during the 2018 election period, surging to more than PRs1,100 billion by \nAugust 2018.  \n \n4.  Furthermore, while Pakistan has lacked generation capacity to meet growing demand for \nat least the past 7 years, new power generation capacity to be installed through the China\u2013\nPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative will likely lead the country into capacity surplus by \n2021 (footnote 3). However, CPEC IPPs and other IPPs are all established based on long-term \npower purchasing agreements (PPAs), which means that DISCOs and end-consumers need to \npay for contracted capacity and supply even when there isn\u2019t enough demand for electricity supply \nor insufficient capacity. The mechanism of take-or-pay PPAs, guaranteed by the Government of \n                                                \n1 Asian Development Bank. 2014.

Islamabad. \n4 This includes the accumulated stock of about PRs374 billion and PRs335 billion recorded on Power Holding Company \nLimited (a special purpose company for debt services). \n ", "2 \nPakistan, was necessary when there was insufficient generation capacity, and other subsector \nentities lacked creditworthiness to attract private investors. However, the anticipated capacity \nsurplus turns them into a new threat to the financial sustainability of the sector. \n \n5.  While near-term solutions to these financial issues still need to be devised by the new \ngovernment that took office in 2018, Pakistan has envisioned as a long-term strategy the \nintroduction of a market-oriented model in the electricity subsector since the early 2000s.5 \nUnbundling of WAPDA, then a vertically-integrated utility, in 2002 was the first step. In 2008, the \nCentral Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) was established as a single-buyer. However, as a \ntemporary measure, NTDC housed CPPA until it develops the structure and capacity to become \nan independent entity. The separation of CPPA from NTDC was delayed and happened only in \n2015 with support from ADB\u2019s Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program Subprogram 2.6 \n \n6.  Subsequently, the predecessor of this project supported the government and CPPA-G to \ndevelop the concept of the market model to be adopted in Pakistan (footnote 1). The introduction \nof CTBCM will not initially create a fully competitive market. It will provide an environment for \nbilateral contracts between power producers and distribution companies. CPPA-G will develop a \nfunction of balancing mechanism, in which CPPA-G will determine the most efficient way to fill \nthe  gap  between  contracted  supply  and  demand.  This  concept  went  through  extensive \nconsultations with the government and the regulator, the National Electric Power Regulatory \nAuthority (NEPRA), and it is going through a public consultation process led by NEPRA. The \ngovernment, CPPA-G and NEPRA are working to meet the target set by the government\u2019s \nEconomic Coordination Committee to start market operations from July 2021. \n \n7.  In the long-run,7 a market model will need to evolve and lead to competitive processes of \nelectricity sales and purchases. This means that the most efficient generators will be at an \nadvantage and those that are not will gradually cease to exist.  Competition in the capacity market \nwill also help signal excess or shortage of capacity. Competitive trading will also create a \ntransparent and fair mechanism of price settlement. The establishment of such a mechanism will \nhelp enforce market principles regardless of political developments in the country.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n8.  The TA will be aligned with the following impact: efficient and liquid power market design \ndeveloped.8 The TA will have the following outcome: competitive electricity market introduction \nstarted.9 \n \n                                                \n5  ADB has been providing support to improve efficiency of the electricity supply system through a series of loans to \nfinance transmission, distribution and advanced metering infrastructure.  \n6  ADB. 2015. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board: Proposed Policy-Based Loans to the Islamic \nRepublic of Pakistan for Subprogram 2 of the Sustainable Energy Sector Reform Program. Manila. The World Bank \nand the Japan International Cooperation Agency cofinanced the program. \n7 This long-term development after CTBCM will require external developments such as fully operational revenue \nmetering and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system and is beyond the scope of this TA. \n8  Regulation of Generation, Transmission and Distribution of Electric Power (Amendment) Act, 2018. \n9  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "3 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n9.  Output  1:  Key  competitive  market  regulations  developed.  The  CPPA-G  has \ndeveloped a high-level market development roadmap with support from another ADB TA (footnote \n1). This roadmap will need to be updated based on revisions to the design through the public \nconsultation process of the CTBCM concept and requirements of new regulations. The roadmap \nwill also need to be endorsed by market participants. Among the new regulations, this TA will \nmainly focus on the updates and revisions to the commercial code, which will govern the activities \nof market participants. Along with these, the development of competitive market contracts and \ntransition plans from the current long-term PPA regime to the bilateral contract model will also be \na key element in the roadmap. The TA will prepare these drafts with CPPA-G staff so that \nknowledge of the substance and preparation of such documents will remain within the CPPA-G \neven after TA completion.  \n \n10.  Output 2: Human resource capacity for implementing the new market design is \nstrengthened. The CPPA-G has established Strategy and Market Development Department and \nhas adequately staffed it with professionals. These staff have worked with the consultants of in a \nprevious ADB TA and have built good capacity to understand and work on the design and \nimplementation of competitive markets. Under detailed design various sensitivities of market \nsimulation modeling to forecast market prices will be carried out, and the detailed simulation \nmethods and processes will be documented for CPPA-G\u2019s future operations to retain capacity \nafter TA completion. Further, as market implementation starts, the business processes of the \ncurrent single-buyer model will also need to be adapted to the new model. The current business \nprocess is well established within the CPPA-G. The revised business processes will be identified \nand documented for CPPA-G\u2019s future operations.  \n \n11.  Output  3:  Coordination  capacity  of  the  Central  Power  Purchasing  Agency \n(Guarantee) Limited improved. Coordination among subsector entities such as the regulator, \ngovernment ministries and private investors will be one of CPPA-G\u2019s most challenging tasks in \nimplementing the CTBCM. The CPPA-G will establish an overarching Market Implementation \nMonitoring Group to be chaired by the Ministry of Energy. From market participant comments \nthrough the ongoing public consultation, key issues will be identified, for which separate issue \nsubcommittees will have to be established. These subcommittees will help CPPA-G manage \nstakeholder coordination more efficiently and effectively. This will also include assisting the \nCPPA-G in developing standard operating procedures that includes information clusters, sources \nof information, templates of coordinating activities, methods of collecting and sharing information, \nallocation of roles and responsibilities and data institutionalization to help keep track of required \nregulatory documents and their development status.  \n \n12.  Where possible, all documents and knowledge products of the TA will be produced in \ndigital publication. However, some documents will require printed copies for distribution within the \ngovernment.  \n \n ", "4 \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $750,000, of which $700,000 will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6).10 The key expenditure items are listed in \nAppendix 2.  \n \n14.  The government will provide counterpart support in the form of: office space, equipment \nand furniture for consultants to conduct TA activities, internet access for consultants in the office, \nassignment of counterpart personnel (with sufficient dedication to the TA activities), and other \nneeds that may arise during the TA period.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n15.  ADB will administer the TA. The executing agency, CPPA-G, is a 100% state-owned \ncompany  in  charge  of  electricity  payment  settlements  and  a  drive  force  of  market  model \nimplementation in Pakistan.
