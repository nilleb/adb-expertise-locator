Pakistan economic growth is significantly hindered by the low growth of its micro, small \nand medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). A key constraint to the development of the MSME sector \nis the limited access to finance. Commercial bank credit to gross domestic product (GDP) has \nplummeted from 29% in 2008 to 18% of GDP in 2019. Of private credit to GDP, the MSME sector \nis among the least serviced.1 Although MSMEs constitute more than 30% of the GDP and 80% \nof non-agricultural employment, these enterprises are a significantly smaller part of the GDP as \ncompared to other peer countries. 23 \n \n2.  The microfinance sector is the primary financier, in terms of number of borrowers, for \nMSMEs. Pakistan\u2019s formal financial system provides financing for 7.2 million MSMEs. The \nsignificant majority of these (7.0 million) are serviced by microfinance providers (MFPs), including \n6.7 million households and 263,000 micro and small-sized enterprise (MSE).4 \n \n3.  Deep impact of COVID-19 on MSMEs. By the end of 2020, Pakistan\u2019s microfinance \nindustry had outstanding loans of approximately $2.0 billion (PRs 324 billion).5 Since 2015 the \nMSE loan book has grown at a compound average growth rate of 35% while client outreach \nincreased at a compound average growth rate of 20%. However, due to the economic decline in \n2019 and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, client outreach and loan disbursements \nto  households  dropped  sharply  and  further  decline  is  anticipated. Women  borrowers  were \nparticularly hard hit. The proposed project is to restore economic resilience of the household and \nMSME borrowers in response to the ongoing crisis and help kick-start lending to this clientele.  \n \n4.  In 2018 the Government published targets to be met by 2023 under the National Financial \nInclusion Strategy (NFIS) to support financial access and inclusion, and eventually economic \ngrowth. The Strategy encompassed five major targets, including enhancing access to finance for \nsmall and medium enterprises (SMEs) and increasing agriculture finance, including to rural areas. \nWith an expected $200 million gap in liquidity for the microfinance sector due to the coronavirus \npandemic and the 2019 economic slowdown, access to finance for MSMEs is expected to suffer \nfurther. Resultingly, the Government requested ADB to support MSMEs through the microfinance \nsector.  \n \n5.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) will help preparation of a proposed loan of $125 \nmillion  from  ADBs  ordinary capital resources supporting  financial  inclusion  of MSMEs  and \nentrepreneurial households in Pakistan. The proposed project will be aligned to the following \nimpact:  women  and  rural  beneficiaries  enhanced  and  economic  resilience  of  MSEs  and \nhouseholds,  in  response  to  economic  decline  and  COVID-19,  supported.  The  outcome  is \nincreased MSE and household financial services outreach with a special focus on women and \nrural areas. The project will have three outputs: (i) risk taking capacity of microfinance providers \nexpanded, (ii) funding of selected microfinance providers enhanced, and (iii) Government\u2019s Youth \nEntrepreneurship Scheme program outreach enhanced. \n \n1  World Bank.

The transaction technical assistance (TRTA) will help the ADB project team, and the \ngovernment prepare the project. The TRTA is justified given the innovative financing mechanisms \nto be employed under the project. ADB has been a key development partner in the microfinance \nsector for Pakistan, however this will be the first project in the sector since 2006. technical \nassistance (TA) will develop the project design and has five outputs: (i) Wholesale administrator \nof funds confirmed, (ii) MFPs selected, (iii) Credit guarantee facility designed, (iv) Credit auction \nsystem designed and managed, and (v) Capacity of Government support for MSMEs, including \nYES Program, improved. \n \nB.  Outputs and Activities \n \n7.  The transaction technical assistance (TA) supports the project design described in the \nconcept paper as follows: \n \n8.  Output  1:  Wholesale  distributor  of  funds  confirmed.  The  Pakistan  Microfinance \nInvestment Company (PMIC) is the anticipated wholesale administrator of the credit guarantee \nfacility (Project Output 1) and loan facility (Project Output 2).6 The TA will support the project team \nto: \n \n(i)  Conduct due diligence on PMIC to confirm commitment and capability in selecting \neligible microfinance providers (MFPs), including microfinance banks (MFBs) and \nmicrofinance institutions (MFIs), and originating and managing guarantees for them; \n(ii)  Conduct due diligence on PMIC to confirm commitment and capability in selecting \neligible MFPs, and managing loans to MFPs; \n(iii)  Subject to confirmation of the due diligence findings by the government and the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), prepare documentation, including a draft term \nsheets, loan and project agreements setting out key performance criteria, covenants, \nadministration arrangements related to PMIC\u2019s duties for reflection in the project \nadministration manual (PAM) and other project agreements.7 \n \n9.  Output  2:  Microfinance  providers  selected.  To  ensure  financial  and  managerial \nsoundness and ability of MFPs to absorb credit guarantees and additional credit, the TA will \nsupport the project team to identify suitable MFPs participating in the project. This includes a \nreview of MFP outreach practices to priority sectors and identification of TA measures to improve \nwomen client outreach via branchless banking solutions and women targeted financial literacy \ntraining during project implementation. \n \n10.  This entails the preparation of a list of MFPs based on eligibility criteria including their \nfinancial track record, absorptive capacity, target beneficiary focus in MSE, women, and rural \n \n6 PMIC is a national apex institution for microfinance providers in the country. PMIC provides market-based wholesale \nlending (debt and equity) to microfinance providers that on-lend to borrowers. PMIC was established as a pillar of \nthe Government of Pakistan\u2019s National Financial Inclusion Strategy. The shareholders of PMIC include Pakistan \nPoverty  Alleviation  Fund  (Government  of  Pakistan),  Karandaaz  Pakistan  (UK  Foreign,  Commonwealth  and \nDevelopment Office supported) and KfW. \n7 Should PMIC not be considered suitable, the TA will identify alternative arrangements in coordination with the \nregulators (State Bank of Pakistan and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan). \n ", "4   \n \nmarket segments, as well as use of branchless banking technology.8 The TA will support the \nproject team to conduct due diligence on selected MFPs, anticipated to be done in close \ncoordination with PMIC.  \n \n11.  Due diligence will confirm the MFP funding requirements, in particular the need for pari \npassu guarantees, senior debt and subordinated debt based on which ADB loan funds will be \nallocated.9 Since MFBs have access to significant deposit funds it appears that guarantees or \nsubordinated debt instruments are needed to fund MFB growth, while MFIs likely need senior \nloans to boost liquidity, and in some cases subordinated loans to strengthen their solvency.  \n \n12.  Subsequent to confirmation of the wholesale administrator of funds (preferably PMIC) and \nthe selection of MFPs, the TA will support the project team in completing project documentation \nincluding  financial  analysis,  financial  management  assessment,  environmental  and  social \nsafeguard arrangements, and integrity due diligence of the executing agencies, implementing \nagencies, and selected MFPs; and preparation of a gender action plan consistent with national \nlaw and applicable ADB policies. \n \n13.  Output 3: Credit guarantee facility designed. Pari passu credit guarantees covering up \nto 50% of eligible loans (Project Output 1) are expected to boost lending to priority sectors (women \nand rural beneficiaries). The credit guarantees to be distributed and managed by an administrator \n(PMIC) will be backed by an ADB stand-by loan to the government. The TA will:  \n   \n(i)  identify MFPs\u2019 target beneficiary segments within defined exposure limits; \n(ii)  propose key performance indicators for monitoring participating MFPs (identified \nunder TA Output 2) and subloan utilization by target beneficiaries, especially women \nand rural borrowers;  \n(iii)  draft guarantee underwriting, selection, and monitoring guidelines; \n(iv)  draft guarantee pricing and loss adjustment policies and procedures; \n(v)  draft model guarantee term sheet and risk participation agreement; \n(vi)  draft disbursement arrangements and related reporting requirements; and  \n(vii)  draft  guarantee  agreements  setting  out  key  performance  criteria,  covenants, \nadministration arrangements for reflection in the PAM and project agreements. \n \n14.  Output 4: Credit auction system designed and managed. To address MFP short term \nfunding needs and to strengthen solvency, an ADB loan will offer senior and subordinated loans \nto selected MFPs. The senior loans will carry maturities of up to 36 months and subordinated \nloans will carry maturities of up to 10 years. The maturity of the ADB loan will not exceed 10 years \npermitting up to four funding rounds for senior loans to MFPs. The loan funds will be distributed \nthrough an auction process administered by a reputable international consulting firm, acting as \nan independent third party. The TA will support the project by drafting:  \n(i)  contractual arrangements of ADB and PMIC with the government for channeling the \nloan;  \n(ii)  an independent auctioning process to ensure efficiency, transparency, and fairness;  \n(iii)  estimate cost for administering the auctions and the auctioning process as described \nin the terms of reference for the independent third party; \n \n8 Shortlisting Criteria for Microfinance Providers (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n9 An initial survey of the active MFPs revealed a high demand for the facilities offered under the proposed project. The \ninterested MFPs constitute a significant majority of the sub-borrower base and include some of the largest MFPs. At \nleast six MFBs and nine MFIs expressed interest in the guarantee and/or credit enhancement facilities. During the \nproject processing phase, there will be further clarity on the number of eligible MFPs under the project. \n ", "5 \n \n(iv)  operating rules for the auction mechanism including a dedicated auction website to \nensure timely disclosure of auction results, and loan disbursements by participating \nMFPs; \n(v)  a competitive price setting mechanism for the auctioning process; \n(vi)  eligibility criteria and borrowing limits for MFPs reflecting their financial standing, \nabsorptive capacity based on TA Output 1 and funding needs for target beneficiaries; \n(vii)  model senior and subordinated term sheets and related loan agreements, including \nsetting out key performance criteria, and covenants; \n(viii)  disbursement arrangements and related reporting requirements;  \n(ix)  key performance criteria, covenants, administration arrangements for reflection in \nthe PAM and project agreements; and \n(x)  standard operating procedures for the auctioning including announcing, execution \nand reporting of auction results to the Project Steering Committee and subsequently \npublishing approved results on a website. \n(xi)  the tasks of the administrator (PMIC) in executing the loan agreements with MFPs. \n \n15.  Output 5. Capacity of government support for MSMEs, including YES Program, \nimproved.  At  request  of  the  government,  ADB  will  support  the  government\u2019s  Youth \nEntrepreneurship Scheme (YES) Phase 2 targeting MSEs with loans up to PRs1 million ($6,190) \nunder Project Output 3. The TA will:  \n \n(i)  review YES Phase 1 as well as the design for Phase 2 and identify gaps for \nimprovement; \n(ii)  review the government\u2019s strategic objectives and lessons from past programs;  \n(iii)  review YES credit and guarantee underwriting processes, exposure and risk limits, \nrecommend improvements on the quality of investments, and widen access to \neligible beneficiaries; \n(iv)  if ADB is satisfied with the design of the YES, support the project team in completion \nof proposed Project Output 3 project documentation, draft key performance criteria, \ncovenants, administration arrangements for reflection in the PAM and other project \nagreements. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,000,000, of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by ADB\u2019s Technical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-other sources) and (ii) $500,000 will \nbe financed on grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and \nadministered by ADB. The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 1. Funding from the \nRepublic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund will support Outputs 3 and 4 of the \nTA  and  knowledge  sharing  events.10 The  government  will  bear  the costs related to  office \naccommodation and in-kind support by dedicated executing and implementing agency staff as \nwell as in relation to project coordination. The government was informed that approval of the TA \ndoes not commit ADB to finance any ensuing project.   \n                 \n \n \n \n10  The EAKPF will finance operational expenses related to eligible proposals, as agreed upon by the Government and \nADB. It will not be used for  (i) civil works, (ii) procurement of large-scale equipment, (iii) permanent staffing costs, or \n(iv) the hiring of staff consultants. \n ", "6   \n \nD.
