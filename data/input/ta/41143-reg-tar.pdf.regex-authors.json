In  1999  the  Asian  Development  Bank  (ADB)  made  poverty  reduction  its  single \noverarching objective, and a region free of poverty is the vision that underpins the 2001\u20132015 \nLong-Term Strategic Framework (LTSF).1 The LTSF identifies three core strategic thrusts for \nADB\u2019s interventions: (i) sustainable economic growth, (ii) inclusive social development, and \n(iii) governance for effective polices and institutions. The three crosscutting themes under the \nLTSF  are  (i)  the  role  of  the  private  sector  in  development,  (ii) regional  cooperation  and \nintegration for development, and (iii) environmental sustainability.  \n \n2.  The  Asia  and  Pacific  region  is  changing  dramatically  and  ADB  must  also  undergo \nchange to align itself to the region\u2019s new needs and demands. ADB\u2019s LTSF remains relevant in \nmany respects; however,  during the review of the implementation of the first medium-term \nstrategic framework2 (MTS I) and preparation of the second MTS3 (MTS II), it was recognized \nthat many factors not envisioned at the time of LTSF formulation have emerged as driving \nforces of change in the region. The ADB President, at the 39th Annual Meeting in Hyderabad, \nIndia, announced ADB\u2019s intention to review the LTSF in the context of dynamic changes taking \nplace. To start the process, a panel of eminent persons was convened in June 2006 to provide \ninsights into the region\u2019s future and how it will affect the future role of ADB. The panel\u2019s views \nwere shared with ADB stakeholders in the form of a report and discussed at the Governors \nSeminar  in  ADB\u2019s  40th  Annual  Meeting  on  5  May  2007  in  Kyoto,  Japan.  The  Governors \nSeminar marked the first occasion of substantive consultation on ADB\u2019s LTSF review. \n \n3.  The report of the eminent persons group (EPG) presents a dramatically transformed \nAsia by 2020, where more than 90% of its people would be living in \u201cmiddle-income\u201d countries \nand where the development challenges would have shifted from reduction of absolute poverty to \na variety of new issues emerging as a result of the region\u2019s fast-paced economic growth. To \naddress these new challenges, the EPG recommended that ADB\u2019s activities be increasingly \nfocused on three strategic directions: (i) from poverty reduction to support for higher and more \ninclusive growth; (ii) from economic growth to environmentally sustainable growth; and (iii) from \na  primarily  national  focus  to  a  regional  and  ultimately  global  focus.  To  achieve  the  three \nstrategic objectives, the EPG recommended that ADB realign operations on six core areas: (i) \ninfrastructure development, with emphasis on public-private partnerships; (ii) financial sector \ndevelopment that supports the growth of regional financial markets; (iii) energy and environment \nactivities focusing on global issues, such as climate change; (iv) regional integration, which \nwould  be  central  to  all  of  ADB\u2019s  operational  activities;  (v)  technological  development  and \ninnovation; and (vi) knowledge management, with ADB serving as a platform for knowledge \nsharing. \n \n4.  The EPG report provides key inputs for discussion and stakeholder consultations on \nADB\u2019s future role as a regional development bank, given the outlook of the Asia and Pacific \nregion  by  2020.  To  remain  relevant  and  effective,  ADB  will  need  to  carefully  plan  its \ntransformation  in  parallel  with  the  region\u2019s  economic  transition.  Broad-based  stakeholder \nconsultations both within and outside the region would be integral to determining ADB\u2019s long-\nterm strategic directions.   \n \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

Under  the  LTSF,  ADB  has  completed  considerable  work  in  charting  its  operational \nstrategies and policies. This is particularly true of the operational themes emphasized in the \nLTSF, such as regional cooperation and integration, governance, private sector development, \nand gender. On those themes, ADB already has in place strategic directions, each updated by \nrecent Board papers (e.g., Regional Cooperation and Integration [Sec.M30-06, 31 May 2006], \nSecond Governance and Anticorruption Action Plan [IN.216-06, 4 August 2006], Private Sector \nDevelopment: A Revised Strategic Framework [IN.27-06, 9 February 2006], and Implementation \nReview of the Policy on Gender and Development [IN.331-06, 17 November 2006]).  \n \n6.  Given the far reaching changes taking place in the Asia and Pacific region since the \ninception of the LTSF in March 2001, however, the relevance of LTSF for continuing to guide \nADB operations to 2015 must be carefully reviewed. For instance, the unprecedented economic \ngrowth of the region has achieved dramatic reduction in the level of extreme poverty. The \nincidence of poverty in the region, as measured by $1 per day, declined from 34.6% in 1990 to \n18% by 2005, each percentage point of economic growth resulting in almost 2 percentage point \ndecline in the incidence of poverty on average. Though this is a significant progress toward a \nvision of Asia free of poverty, poverty incidence measured by $2 per day still remains high at \n51.9% in 2005, declining from 75% in 1990. It must be recognized that despite higher than \nexpected economic growth rates in recent years, more than half of developing Asia\u2019s population \nstill live in poor conditions, with limited access to social services such as health and education.   \n \n7.  Furthermore, high economic growth rates have not been shared equally. Both relative \nand absolute inequalities are rising, raising concerns of social and political unrest in some \ncountries.  Income  disparity  between  the  rural  and  urban  population  is  widening.  Limited \nemployment  opportunities  in  rural  areas  have  accelerated  migration  to  cities, exacerbating \nurban congestion, and lack of adequate water supply, housing, wastewater treatment, and solid \nwaste management. Given the changing dynamics of economic growth and the makeup of the \npoor, there is a need to reexamine ADB\u2019s approach to supporting poverty reduction. Several \ngovernments, including those of India and the People\u2019s Republic of China, for example, have \nadopted the concept of inclusive growth in their recent strategic plans.4 Also the EPG report \nrecommends ADB to adopt \u201chigher and more inclusive growth\u201d as one of ADB\u2019s three strategic \ndirections in the future. To initiate discussion and consultation on this subject, the Economic \nResearch Department published a policy brief5 in May 2007 on the subject of inclusive growth \nas an alternative to targeted approach to poverty reduction.  \n \n8.  One major factor driving economic growth in the region is globalization, progressing at a \nmuch faster pace than was expected. Within Asia, development of private-sector-driven vertical \nintegration of production networks, adoption of outward-oriented economic policies by many \ncountries and the rapid economic growth of India and the People\u2019s Republic of China, have all \nprovided considerable impetus to regional integration. Intra-regional trade now accounts for \n55%  of  Asia\u2019s  total  trade,  sharply  up  from  approximately  43%  in  the  early  1990s.  Given \nexpected continuation of this trend, ADB\u2019s role in promoting regional cooperation and facilitating \nregional integration is likely to continue to increase in its significance. ADB, however, may need \nto become better prepared and better equipped to meet the diverse and sophisticated demand \n                                                 \n4  Planning Commission, Government of India. 2006.

In particular, knowledge and technological innovation have been \nidentified as key drivers of regional integration and economic growth for East Asia.6 If ADB is to \nplay an enhanced role in transferring knowledge, technology, and innovation within the region, \nthe scope of ADB activities for this purpose must be carefully considered in conjunction with \nADB\u2019s overall strategic directions. \n \n9.  The success of the region in reaping the benefit of globalization has resulted in large \naccumulation of foreign exchange reserves in the region, causing global imbalance. This is in \nsharp contrast to the situation 40 years ago, when the need of the developing member countries \nwas primarily to receive foreign exchange from capital-surplus developed countries for funding \ninvestments.  Increasingly,  successful  archetype  for  development  assistance  in  the  region \ndemands greater emphasis on knowledge transfer alongside long-term funds. With its high \nsavings rate, the region in large part is no longer in a position to regard shortage in supply of \nfunds as a binding constraint to development. It is thus paradoxical that a large amount of \nregional funds are being channeled to developed countries for investment, making the region \nnet exporter of funds, while huge investment needs, in particular for infrastructure development, \nremain unmet in the region.  \n \n10.  There is consensus on the need for the region to put its accumulated financial resources \nto better use. Structural improvements in the investment environment at the microeconomic \nlevel, notably in governance frameworks, and deepening and broadening of financial systems \nhave been recommended as policy prescriptions.7 For ADB to give financial sector development \nan operational focus, there must be greater clarity on ADB\u2019s future interventions in that sector. \nFirst, ADB\u2019s traditional approach to developing the financial sector will need to be reexamined. \nAlso, if ADB is to play a greater role as an interregional financial intermediary, expanding the \nissuance of local currency bonds and use of guarantees may also be considered. The Finance \nSub-committee of the Community of Practice, with the assistance of the Office of Regional \nEconomic Integration, is currently undertaking a study of ADB\u2019s financial sector assistance and \nlessons learned, which will likely provide important inputs for further discussion and stakeholder \nconsultation on this subject. \n \n11.  The dramatic rise in the region\u2019s commercial and industrial activities is exacerbating the \nseverity of environmental problems, which may themselves undermine growth and poverty \nreduction. Trans-boundary resources are often managed unsustainably and cross-boarder trade \nis bound to aggravate over-exploitation of timber and wildlife as growing demand by the region\u2019s \ngrowth centers for resources exceeds current supply. The region consequently is experiencing; \n(i)  significant  decline  in  quantity  and  quality  of  natural  resources,  (ii)  degradation  in  the \nfundamental ecosystem, (iii) increasing number of climate-related environmental hazards, and \n(iv) high rate of water and air pollution. ADB has always been conscious of environmental \nissues in its development efforts and has placed \u201cenvironmental sustainability\u201d as one of the \nthree cross-cutting strategic themes under the LTSF. However, environmental degradation is \nbecoming a global concern of unprecedented magnitude. Given the importance of this issue for \nthe region, ADB may  need to reconsider its strategic approach to ensuring environmental \nsustainability. \n \n12.  In aligning its strategic focus with the emerging issues of the region, ADB will also need \nto address some critical institutional issues including transaction costs, operational products, \nand financial and human resources. The need for ADB to streamline its business process and \n                                                 \n6  World Bank. 2006. An East Asian Renaissance, Ideas for Economic Growth.

Also, improving the existing products and services as \nwell as considering new ones would be important for ADB in maintaining its relevance. Products \nand services must also be assessed against the needs of the region and ADB\u2019s institutional \ncapacity.  The  ongoing  evaluation  of  the  multitranche  financing  facility,  another  study  on \nenhancing the effectiveness of  technical assistance (TA), and, a review of the program loan \nmodality and innovation and efficiency initiatives (IN.43-07, 19 March 2007) can be expected to \nprovide  important  insights.  Furthermore,  ADB\u2019s  long-term  strategic  framework  will  need  to \nconsider human and financial resources issues.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n13.  The  TA  aims  to  define  a  revised  and  updated  long-term  corporate-wide  strategic \nframework relevant to the context and evolving needs of the region and the interests of ADB\u2019s \nmembers. Feedback obtained through comprehensive stakeholder consultations will be the \nbasis for formulating ADB\u2019s new long-term strategic directions. \n \n14.  By realigning ADB\u2019s activities and institutional framework to the revised and updated \nLTSF, ADB will be better positioned to meet the emerging development needs and demands of \nthe region. Simultaneously, ADB will need to define a mechanism for prioritizing its resources on \nselected strategic areas. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n15.  The  final  output  of  the  review  will  be  a  revised  and  updated  long-term  strategic \nframework.  \n \n16.  Steps  to  be  taken  in  preparation  of  the  revised  and  updated  long-term  strategic \nframework will include : \n \n(i)  carrying out studies on specific issues that need to be clarified for the review; \n(ii)  examining the lessons learned from the medium-term strategy review in 2006 \nand the Operations Evaluation Department\u2019s ongoing review of the LTSF; \n(iii)  undertaking  and  documenting  internal  and  external  consultations  with  ADB \nstakeholders, including organized regional workshops with participants from the \ngovernment, the private sector, civil society, and the academe; \n(iv)  launching  internal/external  websites  to  facilitate  broad-based  stakeholder \nconsultation; and \n(v)  drawing conclusions from consultations and proposing ADB\u2019s future strategic \ndirections.  \n17.  Within ADB, a LTSF review steering committee was established in April 2007. Guided by \nthat committee, the Strategy and Policy Department (SPD), acting as the secretariat for the \nLTSF review, will prepare the details of activities of the review. \n ", "  5\n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $600,000 equivalent, to be financed on a \ngrant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. Appendix 2 gives details of the cost estimates and \nfinancing plan. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  SPD will implement the TA over 11 months, from July 2007 to July 2008 based on the \ndecisions made by the steering committee. The steering committee is tasked to advise ADB \nManagement and staff on the scope of the LTSF review and provide guidance on all aspects of \nthe exercise. It will identify specific matters/issues for consultation with ADB\u2019s internal/external \nstakeholders and make recommendations on ADB\u2019s future long-term strategic directions for \nconsideration and discussion by the Management and the Board. The outline terms of reference \nfor the steering committee are in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The TA will also support implementation of the consultation plan developed to ensure \neffective and meaningful consultation with ADB stakeholders. The plan is organized around \nmajor targeted groups: (i) ADB shareholders, (ii) other funding agencies, (iii) ADB staff, and (iv) \nother  external  stakeholders,  including  the  private  sector,  civil  society,  and  the  academe. \nAppendix 4 contains the preliminary consultation plan. The TA will fund regional workshops to \nbe held for both borrowing and nonborrowing member countries and will also support the \nengagement of experienced development specialists as facilitators or as resource persons to \nguide consultation. \n \n21.  The  steering  committee  may  also  undertake  selective  studies  on  issues  that  need \nresolution for the LTSF review. It is expected that several such studies will be commissioned to \ninternational  consultants  assisted  by  national  consultants.  Estimated  inputs  are  7  person-\nmonths from international consultants and 21 person-months from national consultants. The \noutline terms of reference for the studies are in Appendix 3. On the basis of the individual \nconsultants\u2019 relevant experience and track record, the steering committee will endorse them and \ntheir terms of reference before they are engaged. Individual consultants will be selected and \nhired  according  to  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  and  other  arrangements \nsatisfactory to ADB for the hiring of consultants. The consultants\u2019 outputs will be reviewed and \ncommented on by the steering committee. \n \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION  \n \n22.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nsupport the Review of the Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, and \nhereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n   ", "6    Appendix 1 \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data Source/  Assumptions \nDesign Summary \nTargets/Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Risk \nEnhanced relevance  (cid:131)  Sustained  (cid:131)  Selected internal and  (cid:131)  Materialization of \nand effectiveness of the  economic growth in  external research  exogenous shocks to the \nAsian Development  the region  and policy analysis  regional economy \nBank (ADB) as a  (cid:131)  Reduced inequality  on developing Asia   \nregional development  as measured by  (cid:131)  Data/information on \nbank    access to  the review of regional \nopportunities for  economic \nbenefiting from  performance \neconomic growth \nOutcome      Assumptions \nADB\u2019s activities and  (cid:131)  Increased demand  (cid:131)  ADB\u2019s pipeline of  (cid:131)  ADB\u2019s capacity to adapt \ninstitutional framework  and recognition for  projects (RCSPs,  to changing global/ \nrealigned to the   ADB\u2019s products  CPSs, and WPBFs)  regional economic and \nrevised and updated  and services  (cid:131)  Evaluation reports  financial conditions  \nlong-term strategic  (cid:131)  Improving trends in  (cid:131)  Progress reported on  (cid:131)  Availability of adequate \nframework (LTSF) for  portfolio  the implementation  ADB resources \nbetter meeting the  performance and in  plan \nemerging development  the ratio of \nneeds and demands of  successful projects \nthe region \nOutputs      Assumptions \nRevised and updated  (cid:131)  Volume and quality  (cid:131)  Feedback on the  (cid:131)  Consensus and support \nlong-term corporate- of ADB\u2019s products  strategic framework  obtained among ADB\u2019s \nwide strategic  and services in line  from stakeholders  stakeholders  \nframework and its initial  with the strategic  through  (cid:131)  Clear operational \nimplementation plan   framework  consultations/  guidelines established \n(cid:131)  Institutional   website posting \nRisk \nchanges made in  (cid:131)  Management and \n(cid:131)  Readiness of ADB as an \nline with the 3-year  Board discussions \ninstitution to undertake \nimplementation    the necessary alignments \nplan \n  with the revised and \nupdated LTSF  \n \nActivities with Milestones  Inputs \n  (cid:131)  ADB to provide $600,000 \n(cid:131)  Consultation with ADB stakeholders  to fund studies, external \nstakeholder consultations, \n(cid:131)  Completion of studies undertaken for resolution of specific issues under \nand publication of the final \nthe review \nreport  \n(cid:131)  Preparation of a draft strategy paper for feedback from ADB stakeholders \n(cid:131)  ADB to clearly define its \n(cid:131)  Discussion of the strategy paper by the Management and members of the  long-term goal and \nBoard  institutional requirements \n  for achieving that goal  \n \n ", "                      Appendix 1  7\nInputs \n(cid:131)  ADB stakeholders \n(DMCs, Board members, \nADB management, and \nstaff, among others) to \nprovide feedback as \nrequired  \nCPS = country partnership strategy, RCSP = regional cooperation strategy and program, WPBF = work program and budget \nframework. \n \n \n \n \nShahid Zahid              Bruce Purdue \nOfficer-in-Charge            Officer-in-Charge \nStrategic Planning, Policy and         Strategy and Policy Department \nInteragency Division \nStrategy and Policy Department \n \nDate:                Date: \n \n   ", "8    Appendix 2 \n \nCOST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN \n($'000) \n       \nItem     Total Cost \nA.

The  consultation  plan  is  organized  around  major  targeted  groups:  (i)  ADB \nshareholders,  (ii)  ADB  staff;  (iii)  multilateral/bilateral  partners;  and  (iv)  other  external \nstakeholders, including civil society, the private sector, and the academe.  \n     A.      ADB Shareholders \n \n4.  Consultation with ADB Governors and members of the Board will be undertaken at \ncritical junctures such as the launching of the consultation process, preparation of the \noutline of the Board paper, etc. The first consultation was conducted during ADB\u2019s 40th \nAnnual Meeting in Kyoto in early May 2007, which included the Governors\u2019 Seminar where \nthe eminent persons\u2019 group (EPG) report and the future direction of ADB were discussed.  \n5.  Consultations planned with the members of the Board are as follows: \n(i)  informal Board seminar on the overall consultation plan and the issues to be \ndiscussed during the review, early June 2007; \n(ii)  informal Board seminar on feedback obtained through consultation, September \n2007; \n(iii)  Board and Management Retreat on the outline of the Board paper, October \n2007; \n(iv)  first Board discussion of the Board paper, January 2008; and \n(v)  second Board discussion of the Board paper, March 2008.  \n \n6.  Consultation with the capitals will be undertaken both through Board members and a \nseries of regional workshops. \n7.  In addition, on occasions where senior Management is visiting the member country, \nhe/she will undertake consultations with the capitals. \n     B.     ADB Staff \n \n8.  Three  types  of  consultations  are  planned  with  ADB  staff.  The  first  is  for  the \nManagement to inform the staff of the plans for and progress on the LTSF review. The first \ninstance will be for the Management to inform the staff in early June of the launching of the \nLTSF review, the nature and scope of the review, and the issues on which there will be \nconsultation. ", "12   Appendix 4 \n9.  It  is  proposed  that  subsequent  to  the  Board  and  Management  Retreat,  the \nManagement again inform the staff of the overall strategic directions being considered. \n10.  In both instances, the vice presidents and heads of departments will play a key role, in \nobtaining views of the staff and advising the LTSF review steering ommittee on the feedback \nreceived. \n11.  The second type of consultation is to seek direct inputs from the staff.  Staff input will \nbe sought in formulating ADB\u2019s strategic directions through (i) a website, and (ii) town-hall \ntype consultations.  \n12.  The third type of consultation will be on the specific issues for review. Issues to be \nreviewed and reassessed will be identified by the steering committee. Each issue identified \nwill be assigned for discussion and resolution or, alternatively, options for resolution to a \ntask force to be headed by staff with relevant experience and expertise in the particular \nissue. \n13.  The task force will plan for and conduct focus group discussions for the purpose of \ndrafting a discussion paper on the issue, with suggested resolutions or, alternatively, options \nfor resolution. \n     C.       Other Development Partners \n \n14.   Selective consultations with other key development partner agencies will also be \nundertaken from time to time when senior Management may visit them. \n     D.       Other Stakeholders \n15.  Representatives from civil society organizations, the private sector, and the academe \nwill be invited to regional workshops. \n     E.       Website \n \n16.  Internal and external websites on the LTSF review are proposed to keep all concerned \ninformed  on  the  overall  time  frame,  supporting  analysis,  outcomes  of  consultation, \nmilestones achieved, and conclusions drawn from the review. The websites will also enable \nstakeholders to comment on the consultation process and the draft Board paper, once it is \nprepared. \n \n \n \n "], "metadata": {"ModDate": "D:20070803152234+08'00'", "CreationDate": "D:20070725161927+08'00'", "Title": "Review of the Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank", "Creator": "PScript5.dll Version 5.2", "Author": "", "Producer": "Acrobat Distiller 6.0.1 (Windows)"}, "author_page": "   \n \n \n \n \nABBREVIATIONS \n \n  ADB  \u2013  Asian Development Bank \n  ADF  \u2013  Asian Development Fund \n  DMC  \u2013  developing member country \n  EPG  \u2013  eminent persons group \n  LTSF  \u2013  long-term strategic framework \n  MTS  \u2013  medium-term strategy \n  OCR  \u2013  ordinary capital resources \n  SPD  \u2013  Strategy and Policy Department \n  TA  \u2013  technical assistance \n \n \nTECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLASSIFICATION \n \nTargeting Classification  \u2013  General intervention \nSector  \u2013  Multisector \nSubsector  \u2013  \u2013 \nTheme  \u2013  Capacity development, governance, economic growth \nSubthemes  \u2013  Client relations, network and partnership development, institutional \ndevelopment, organizational development  \n \nNOTE \n \nIn this report, \u201c$\u201d refers to US dollars. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirector General  K.
