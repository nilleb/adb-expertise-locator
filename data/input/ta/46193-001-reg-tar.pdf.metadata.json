INTRODUCTION \n1.  Poverty reduction is the first indicator of the Millennium Development Goals and the \noverarching goal of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). Despite fast economic growth, Asia \nand the Pacific remains home to almost two-thirds of the world\u2018s poor. The region is also \nconfronted  with  rising  inequality.  Its  Gini  coefficient,  the  most  commonly  used  inequality \nmeasure, increased from 0.39 in the mid-1990s to 0.46 in the late 2000s.1 Reducing poverty \nand promoting inclusive growth are major challenges faced by developing member countries \n(DMCs), donors, the development community, and ADB. \n \n2.  Transparent, reliable, timely, and comparable estimates of poverty and inequality are \nessential for a wide range of decisions national governments and development institutions make. \nThey also lay the foundation for poverty and inclusive growth-related research. For example, \nADB Management often quotes the total number of poor in the region in speeches, and both \ndonors and DMCs appealed for poverty updates before the recent Asian Development Fund \nreplenishment negotiation.2 \n \n3.  This technical assistance (TA) aims to (i) measure and monitor poverty and inequality \nregularly for individual DMCs and for the region as a whole; (ii) conduct poverty, inequality, and \ninclusive growth-related research; and (iii) develop a website to disseminate relevant estimates \nand knowledge products, which are expected to aid evidence-based policy formulation.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  While some DMCs release poverty estimates, the main issue lies in comparability across \ncountries. In addition to different reference years, national poverty estimates are often computed \nusing different methodologies including different poverty lines and even different variables\u2014\nmaking aggregation impossible. For comparable estimates and regional aggregates, ADB has \nrelied on the World Bank for poverty estimation and monitoring, although in 2011 the ADB \nEconomics and Research Department (ERD) provided poverty updates for Asian Development \nFund replenishment negotiations. However, three major problems exist with the World Bank \npoverty estimates: (i) lack of transparency, e.g., the World Bank does not provide information on \nthe sources of data for all countries; (ii) long delay in updates, e.g., until middle of February \n2012, the only available comprehensive poverty estimates from the World Bank were for 2005, \nwhich for a dynamic region such as Asia and the Pacific is inadequate and more timely updates \nare called for; and (iii) the analytical method used by the World Bank to produce poverty \nestimates from grouped data is problematic, which requires rectification.4 \n \n5.  Income-based inequalities have been increasing in Asia and the Pacific. Inclusive growth \nis one of the three pillars of ADB\u2018s operations, as outlined in its Strategy 2020.5 However, little \nsystematic information or data on inequalities for the region as a whole are available. Thus, \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2012. Asian Development Outlook. Manila. \n2  RETA 5917 on Building a Poverty Database was approved in 2000, with a budget of US$600,000 and REG-6042 \non Poverty Mapping in Selected DMCs was approved in 2002, with a budget of US$150,000. Both TAs produced \npoverty estimates which are now very outdated. The current RDTA will help to institutionalize the updating process. \n3  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2018s website on 30 October 2012. \n4  For detailed discussion on the analytical methods used by the World Bank, see Anthony Shorrocks and Guanghua \nWan. 2009.

Strategy 2020: The Long-Term Strategic Framework of the Asian Development Bank, 2008\u20132020. \nManila. \n ", "2   \nthere is a need to estimate income-based, and if possible non-income-based, measures of \ninequalities for the region and for individual DMCs. These estimates represent potential building \nblocks for developing inclusive growth indicators. \n \n6.  Related  to  non-income-based  inequality  is  analysis  of  poverty  along  non-income \ndimensions.  Deprivations  in  health,  education,  and  other  social  development  indicators \nincreasingly attract the attention of development agencies and policy makers. The region\u2018s \nprogress in non-income poverty reduction may lag behind the income-based counterpart. This \nhas  profound  implications  for  both  donors  and  aid-recipient  DMCs.  The  United  Nations \nDevelopment Programme (UNDP) has been producing multidimensional poverty index (MPI) \nestimates since 2010 but related research such as determinants of multidimensional poverty \nand its changes remains scarce. Analysis on non-income poverty or MPI estimates needs to be \nexpanded. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA\u2018s intended impact is to improve the effectiveness of DMCs\u2018 policies and ADB\u2018s \nprojects and programs aimed at reducing poverty and inequality and promoting inclusive growth. \nIn the absence of knowledge on poverty and inequality and their changes, it is hardly possible to \ndesign, implement, or evaluate relevant interventions or policies. \n \n8.  The TA\u2018s expected outcome is more evidence-based policy-making by ADB and DMCs. \nRegular and systematic updates on poverty, inequality, and inclusive growth help enhance \nevidence-based policy making. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n9.  The TA will consist of three components: poverty and inequality estimation; research on \npoverty, inequality, and inclusive growth; and construction of a website. \n \n10.  The  first  component  will  focus  on  estimating  income-based  poverty  and  inequality. \nPoverty estimation will rely on the international $1.25 per day, $2.00 per day, and possibly Asian \nand/or relative poverty lines. Purchasing power parity exchange rates and the consumer price \nindex will be used to ensure comparability of poverty estimates across economies and over \ntime. In addition to the number of poor, other poverty indicators such as poverty gap and \nsquared poverty gap will be estimated. \n \n11.  Income-based inequality estimates for the region as a whole may have to use per capita \nGDP data but those for individual DMCs can use household survey observations on average \nincome or expenditure. Demographic and health survey data may be used to estimate non-\nincome-based poverty and inequality. Inequality indexes such as the Gini coefficient and the \ngeneralized entropy measures will be employed. \n \n12.  The second component will focus on the development of inclusive growth indicators at \nthe country level, possibly using a social welfare function approach. Summary measures of \ninclusive growth will be constructed. These summary measures will complement and build upon \nthe framework of inclusive growth indicators of the Development Indicators and Policy Research \nDivision  (ERDI)  of the ADB  ERD,  which  presents tabulation  of 35  indicators. The  second \ncomponent will also explore the determinants and consequences or effects of high poverty and \n ", "  3 \nrising inequality, using various decomposition techniques and econometric modeling. Provided \nthat data are available, poverty can be decomposed by location, sector, population groups, and \nso  on.  It  can  also  be  decomposed  into  transient  and  chronic  components.  In  addition, \nvulnerability to poverty will be investigated for selected DMCs. To differentiate from UNDP\u2018s MPI \nestimates, multidimensional  poverty  measurement  will  employ  Asia-specific  cutoff points  or \nthresholds, which can capture the characteristics of Asian poverty more accurately. Particular \nattention will be paid to variables that are present in ADB DMCs but are missing in the datasets \nused by UNDP to obtain MPI estimates. \n \n13.  Determinants of inequality can be identified by traditional decomposition methods or \nrecently  developed  regression-based  decomposition  techniques.  The  latter  can  attribute \ninequality  or  its  change  to  fundamental  causes  such  as  gender  discrimination,  sector \nsegregation, and labor immobility. 6 \n \n14.  The third component involves website construction, which will lead to improvement in \ntransparency of and access to poverty and inequality estimates by ADB staff, DMCs, and \nexternal institutions and individuals. In addition to regular updates of poverty, inequality, and \ninclusive growth indicators, the website will publish cutting-edge knowledge products and user-\nfriendly tool kits for computation of poverty, inequality, and possibly vulnerability. \n \n15.  The TA will cover as many DMCs as data permit. The data required for poverty and \ninequality estimation can be in different forms. It is preferable to have access to household \nsurvey data. If not, income or expenditure data in grouped form can be used. If a DMC cannot \nprovide data in these forms, it will be requested to provide poverty estimates based on the \ninformation  and  instructions  prepared  by  ADB.  Assistance  from  regional  departments  and \nresident missions will be needed. \n \n16.  Four workshops will be conducted: (i) a consultation workshop with representatives of \nDMCs on data availability issues where national statistical agencies will be requested to provide \ndata or poverty estimates, (ii) a workshop to discuss poverty estimates and preliminary research \nfindings where relevant government agencies will be consulted regarding the official release of \nthe poverty estimates, (iii) a workshop to launch poverty estimates and the website, and (iv) a \nworkshop to disseminate research findings. The participation of government representatives will \nbe financed by this TA. No activities will be financed in any participating DMC unless a no-\nobjection is obtained from the government of such DMC. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n17.  The TA is estimated to cost $700,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2018s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF-IV). The cost estimates and financing plan are in \nAppendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n18.  ADB will be the executing agency of the TA. The TA will be implemented by ERDI for \n24 months, beginning in December 2012 until its targeted completion in December 2014. A \npoverty unit (or team) in ERD will be formed to manage and implement the TA. The poverty unit \n                                                \n6 Guanghua Wan. 2004.

ERDI will closely coordinate with regional departments, resident mission offices, the \nADB Department of External Relations, and relevant national statistical systems, mostly for data \naccess and dissemination activities. The poverty unit (or team) yet to be formally established will \nremain active after completion of the TA to sustain poverty and inequality estimation. ERDI will \nbe working with external centers of excellence in poverty and inclusive growth research, such \nas the Institute for International Economic Policy at the George Washington University and the \nOxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative at the University of Oxford. An advisory \ncommittee  will  be  established,  which  will  consist  of  experts  and  well-known  institutions \nspecializing in poverty and inequality. For website development, ERDI will work with the ADB \nOffice of Information Systems and Technology and the ADB Department of External Relations \nto ensure a user-friendly website and no duplication of websites. ERDI is coordinating with ADB \nRegional and Sustainable Development Department regarding the possible cross-linking or \nconsolidation of existing poverty and poverty-related websites.  \n \n20.  The TA is expected to finance up to 51 person-months of consulting services.7 This \nincludes eight economists (international, 12 person-months) to conduct poverty- and inequality-\nrelated research, one website development specialist (national, 6 person-months) to develop \nthe website, and two research assistants (national, 24 person-months) to assist in the three \ncomponents of the TA. These consultants will be recruited and engaged individually. In addition, \na  consulting  firm  will  be  recruited  using  the  consultants\u2018  qualification  selection  method  to \ndevelop summary measures of inclusive growth and estimates of multidimensional poverty, and \nrelated  analysis  (9  person-months).  The  choice  of  the  consultants\u2018  qualification  selection \nmethod stems from a limited number of firms with the required expertise and experience in the \nfield. In addition, the amount to be contracted is relatively small, so not many institutions are \nexpected to be interested. The TA also provides for the participation of resource persons \n(2 person-months) who will provide technical inputs and guidance during the workshops. Each \nresource person assignment will not exceed 10 working days. \n \n21.  All consultants will be selected and engaged by ADB in accordance with its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2010, as amended from time to time). The scope of work and outline \nterms of reference for the consultants are in Appendix 3. The TA requires newly available \nindividual or household level survey data. These survey datasets will be procured from DMC \nagencies as well as other recognized research agencies. Software will also be procured for the \nTA where needed. Procurement of data and software will be done in accordance with ADB\u2018s \nProcurement Guidelines (2010, as amended from time to time). Disbursement will be done in \naccordance with ADB\u2018s Technical Assistance Disbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from \ntime to time). \n \n22.  Major findings will be disseminated through websites, workshops, seminars, conferences, \nand  various  publications.  However,  before  the  official  release  of  the  poverty  estimates, \nconsultations with various agencies will be done. In coordination with the ADB Department of \nExternal Relations, the project team will develop a dissemination and communications plan for \n                                                \n7  Recruitment of individual consultants and the consulting firm will be done under the TA depending on the nature \nand scope of work and availability of expertise involved. Other than multidimensional poverty and summary \nmeasures of inclusive growth which will be contracted to a consulting firm, a wide range of poverty and inequality-\nrelated research will be conducted under the TA such as vulnerability to poverty, chronic versus transient poverty, \ninequality, and decomposition. Given the diversity of topics and nature and scope of assignments, individual \nconsultants are preferred. \n ", "  5 \nthe  release  of  poverty  estimates  and  key  research  findings  in  the  early  stages  of  TA \nimplementation. Evaluation will be based on knowledge products produced and the number of \ndownloads and accesses to the proposed website.
