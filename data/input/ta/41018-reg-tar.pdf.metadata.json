Cross-border power transmission is already under way between some member countries \nof the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS)\u2014the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) to Viet Nam; \nViet Nam to Cambodia; and the Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) to Thailand. \nPrivate power projects are also being developed for bilateral trading of electricity1. Power flows \nare mostly one-way now but the goal of the GMS nations is to create a regional power trade \n(RPT) to reap mutual economic and technical benefits, and better balance generation resources \nwith electricity needs across their borders and throughout the subregion. Given their different \nlevels of technical capacity, the six GMS countries2 have agreed to a phased approach to \nenhancing RPT.  \n \n2.  To enable reliable exchanges of power, and develop opportunities for power trading, \nwithout negatively affecting reliability in their own systems, the GMS countries must connect and \nsynchronize the operations of their national grids. At the first GMS summit in 2002, the leaders \nof the six countries signed the Inter-Governmental Agreement on Regional Power Trade (IGA) \nin support of this concept. A Regional Power Trade Coordination Committee (RPTCC), created \nin 2004, and consisting of representatives from power utilities and energy ministries in each \nGMS country, was tasked with implementing RPT. The first step in establishing a GMS power \nmarket will be to build or strengthen the necessary institutional structures within the GMS \ncountries. Transmission lines must be planned and built in each country to allow an increase in \ncross-border power transfers. The RPTCC set up a focal group and planning working group \n(PWG) in 2006 to plan the power interconnections and develop a road map in moving towards \nRPT. \n \n3.  Noting that each country also needs to expand institutional capacity to carry out this plan, \nthe RPTCC requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In coordination with \nAgence Fran\u00e7aise de D\u00e9veloppement (AFD) and World Bank, the proposed regional technical \nassistance (RETA) will seek to foster regional power interconnection and trading while also \naddressing  the  environmental  dimension  of  this  undertaking.  The  Government  of  Sweden \nsupports the cooperation for sustainable development within the GMS, which is the focus of the \nproposed RETA and will provide $5.0 million equivalent for its implementation. The RETA3 \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 2. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Economic growth in the GMS countries has been impressive during the last decade, and \nthe demand for power has increased by 9% to 16% per annum. The trend is likely to continue \nfor  at  least  another  10  years.  The  GMS  countries  present  a  diverse  mix  of  needs  and \ncapabilities in their power sectors. Their power utilities differ in size and levels of development.  \nThe smaller utilities will require capacity building programs. Load demand, power generation \ncapacities, the potential to expand, and the types of energy resource they use for power \ngeneration also vary from country to country. The concept of RPT is therefore viewed not only \nas an opportunity to make efficient use of regional energy resources to meet growing national \nelectricity demands but as a way to stimulate investment and economic cooperation among the \nGMS countries and to facilitate their development individually and as a group.  \n                                                 \n1  Nam Theun 2 hydropower project (HPP), Nam Ngum 2 HPP, Nam Ngum 3 HPP, Nam Ngiep 1 HPP, in the Lao \nPDR, for export to Thailand; Xe Kaman 3 HPP in the Lao PDR for export to Viet Nam; 115 kilovolt (kV) \ntransmission line to export power from Thailand to Cambodia; 115 kV transmission line to export power from the \nLao PDR to Cambodia; and 115 kV and 230 kV transmission lines from Viet Nam to export power to Cambodia. \n2  Cambodia, People\u2019s Republic of China (provinces of Yunnan and Guanzxi) , Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, \nMyanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. \n3  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 24 October 2007. \n ", "2     \n5.  ADB and other development partners have been supporting the RPTCC activities, most \nnotably through an AFD-sponsored technical assistance (TA).4 This TA is aimed at preparing a \ndraft regional master plan, preparing and adopting a road map for RPT, setting up a regional \ndatabase,  and  training  in  specific  areas  such  as  performance  standards  and  transmission \nregulation. These activities continue but were not designed to include comprehensively and \nsystematically the procedures that need to be put in place at each stage of developing a RPT. \nThe aim of this RETA is to develop and adopt a road map for implementing the RPT and to \nagree on a regional power interconnection master plan. World Bank has contributed to the \nongoing discussions within the RPTCC by financing studies on (i) good practices in regional \npower purchase agreements between independent power producers exporting to a utility, (ii) a \nbenefit-sharing mechanism for a power interconnection from PRC to Thailand via the Lao PDR, \nand assistance on supporting studies of prioritized interconnections identified in the RPT road \nmap. \n \n6.  Regional institutions need to be set up and strengthened before the GMS countries can \nmove on to the second stage of RPT. This will include the development and adoption of \ntechnical  standards.  Agreements  are  needed  on  (i)  performance  standards;  (ii)  regional \ncommunication,  operational  planning  and  coordination  procedures,  and  protocols  between \nsystem operators; (iii) metering arrangements for grid-to-grid interconnections and trading; (iv) \nregulation and regional trading rules; (v) periodic revision of a regional master plan for cross \nborder investments; (vi) dispute resolution mechanisms; and (vii) a regional regulatory body. \nThe bilateral power trading that now exists will gradually evolve into multiparty trading with \ntransmission lines connecting several countries. This can not take place until the need to \ndevelop  capacity  and  technical  skills  in  the  utilities  and  government  agencies  that  will  be \ninvolved is addressed\u2014a process expected to take several years. In this context, the immediate \npriorities of the RETA are (i) to define a road map for RPT that describes clearly the steps and \nmilestones towards a regional power market, (ii) to define the activities to be undertaken and \nresources required to implement these activities, and (iii) to build the necessary institution and \naddress its capacity-building needs.  \n \n7.  Sustainability requires that the environmental impacts of an expanding energy sector be \naccounted  for  and  incorporated  into  power  sector  development  project  design  and \nimplementation. This requires strong human resource capabilities within individual power utilities \nand environmental ministries. Collective efforts in this area will help GMS countries deal with \nenvironmental protection while developing the power projects they must have. Currently, ADB, \nwith funding from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida), is helping \nGMS  countries  develop  strategic  integrated  environmental  conservation  programs.  The \nproposed RETA will build on the results of this work, and extend it to environmental planning \nand environmental monitoring of future power projects during their construction and operation. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n8.  The objectives of the proposed RETA are: (i) to establish a competitive and efficient \nregional  power  market,  and  (ii)  to  ensure  proper  control  of  environmental  impacts  while \ndeveloping power projects for regional power interconnection and trading. The impacts would be \na more reliable electricity supply, increased rural electrification, and better utilization of system \ncapacities  and  resources  for  power  production  and  use,  while  protecting  the  environment \n                                                 \n4  ADB. 2006. Technical Assistance for the Greater Mekong Subregion Power Trade Coordination and Development. \nManila (TA 6304-REG). \n ", "  3\nagainst excessive impacts. The expected outcomes will be an expanded, fair, and mutually \nbeneficial  cross-border  power  exchange  among  GMS  countries,  with  stronger  physical \ninfrastructure  and  better  institutional  and  regulatory  capability  to  support  this  trade. \nEnvironmental impacts will be minimized. \n \nB.  Methodologies and Key Activities \n9.  The  RETA  will  focus  on  developing  institutions  and  building  capacity  to  match  the \nexpansion of physical infrastructure for a competitive GMS regional power market. The RETA \nwill also build capacity for formulation, implementation, and monitoring of environmental impact \nassessments (EIAs), cumulative impact assessments (CIA), strategic impact assessments  and \nenvironmental management plans (EMPs). The RETA will have two components: (i) facilitating \nthe development of RPT, and (ii) capacity development for managing environmental impacts of \npower projects. Training and workshops will be organized for capacity development under both \ncomponents, and the GMS countries will host the training programs and workshops. \n \n10.  Component  1:  Facilitation  of  Regional  Power  Trade  Development.  The  work \ntowards the RPT regime began a decade ago, with participation of all the GMS power utilities \nand  support  from  their  governments.  The  GMS  countries  are  committed  to  developing  a \nstronger framework for RPT. The ADB has been facilitating the regional dialogue by financing \nthe meetings and studies, and providing technical experts that any single utility would find \ndifficult to mobilize.  \n \n11.  With ADB assistance, a three-year work plan (2005\u20132008) has been developed for \nRPTCC.  It  includes  (i)  finalizing  a  regional  power  trade  agreement,  (ii)  creating  focal  and \nplanning groups, (iii) establishing a database for information exchange and communications, (iv) \nidentifying capacity development needs for the countries, and (v) exchanging experiences in \npower trading with the Nord Power Pool5 and the Southeastern Europe. The proposed RETA \nwill  build  on  these  achievements.  Through  consultation  with  the  GMS  countries  and \ndevelopment partners, a development matrix for RPT has been prepared (Appendix 1), which \nincludes ongoing technical assistance and bilateral cooperation for RPT development. The GMS \ncountries have identified the following immediate priorities: (i) completing the regional master \npower plan, (ii) making the regional power sector database operational, (iii) developing and \ndemonstrating a mechanism for benefit sharing, (iv) planning a regional power system, (v) \ndeveloping  regional  performance  standards,  and  (vi)  establishing  rules  for  transmission \nregulation.  \n \n12.  The proposed RETA will (i) update and finalize the regional master plan for power \ninterconnection,  taking  into  consideration  national  power  development  plans;  (ii)  assist  the \ncountries, as necessary, to prepare national power interconnection plans; (iii) identify priority \npower interconnection projects to be developed in the near term; (iv) conduct feasibility studies \nand full due diligence leading to investment plans for these priority projects; (v) finalize the \nmethodology for evaluating and demonstrating economic benefits gained in the interconnection \nprojects, and apply it to a ongoing project; (vi) continue support for maintaining the regional \npower database to serve as a  planning tool for the GMS region; (vii) establish a regional body \nto serve as the GMS regulatory forum, by assisting the countries in strengthening their own \nregulatory agencies, and creating regional forum for regulating future power trade; and (viii) \nbuild capacity of the utilities and regulators in the GMS countries through specific training to \nsupport implementation of the power trade road map. The RETA will also help:  \n                                                 \n5  Nord Power Pool refers to the power trading among the Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and \nSweden).   \n ", "4     \n(i)  update and finalize the GMS Power Interconnection Master Plan for regional \npower  system  development  for  2008\u20132020,  and  prepare  a  list  of  priority \ninterconnection projects for the period 2008\u20132015.  \n(ii)  finalize  and  demonstrate  the  methodology  for  evaluating  regional  or  country \nbenefits of these priority cross-border interconnection projects;  \n(iii)  conduct  feasibility  studies6 for  priority  cross-border  transmission  lines  and \ngeneration projects, based on the recommendations of the Master Plan;  \n(iv)  support the hosting of the regional power database in a GMS country; \n(v)  assess the regulatory framework of each GMS country, and provide assistance \nto strengthen their respective national regulatory agencies, as needed;  \n(vi)  review  the  relevant  international  experience\u2014the  Nordic  power  pool,  the \nsoutheastern  European  electricity  market,  the  West  Africa  power  pool,  and \nothers\u2014drawing lessons applicable to the GMS; and \n(vii)  provide training, to support RPT implementation, in (a) performance standards, \n(b) transmission regulation, (c) regional operational planning and coordination \nprocedures between system operators, (d) metering and trading arrangements, \n(e)  regulation,  (f)  dispute  resolution  mechanisms,  and  (g)  a  power  trade \nframework.  \n \n13.  Component  2:  Capacity  Development  for  Managing  Environmental  Impacts  of \nPower  Projects.  Managing  and  minimizing  the  environmental  impacts  of  power  projects \nrequires well-functioning regulatory, monitoring, and enforcement functions within the oversight \ninstitutions. It is important that both environmental authorities and power utilities are able to \nprepare EIAs and supervise the implementation of EMPs. Therefore, this component of the \nRETA will address capacity development for effective management of environmental programs \nwhen  implementing  power  projects,  specifically  by  providing  capacity  development  to \nenvironmental ministries and power utilities to undertake CIAs, EIAs and EMPs at the project \nlevel. The component will entail several detailed tasks:  \n(i)  Assess the capacity of the environmental authorities and power companies in \nGMS  countries  for  environmental  planning  and  preparation  of  environmental \nmanagement documents. \n(ii)  Provide  training  to  environment  ministries  and  power  companies  in \nenvironmental planning and management.  \n(iii)  Provide capacity development in establishing regular monitoring mechanisms \nwithin the power utilities to standardize EMP practices.   \n(iv)  Build capacity through pilot CIAs and implementation of EMPs for power projects, \nin cooperation with the GMS Biodiversity Corridors Initiative supported by ADB. \n(v)  Provide practical training in preparation of EMPs. \n \n14.  The RETA will undertake demonstration projects for capacity development, focusing on \nseveral river basins in the region that will be selected in consultation with the countries.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n15.  The cost of the RETA is $5.5 million comprising $5.0 million equivalent to be financed on \na grant basis by the Government of Sweden and to be administered by ADB, and in-kind \nsupport equivalent to $500,000 by GMS countries for office space, local administrative costs, \nreports, etc. A detailed cost estimate is in Appendix 3. \n \n                                                 \n6  Separate consultants will be engaged to perform this task. This is equivalent to a project preparatory technical \nassistance, with due attention to be paid to environmental, social, and resettlement safeguard policies of ADB \n ", "  5\nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n16.  ADB will be the Executing Agency for the RETA. The Infrastructure Division of the \nSoutheast Asia Regional Department (SEID) will take the lead in implementing the RETA in full \nconsultation with ADB divisions and departments involved in the GMS program activities, and \nwith the GMS countries. A secretariat for the RETA will be established within SEID under the \noverall  direction  of  the  assigned  task  manager.  The  secretariat  will  be  responsible  for \ncoordination  with  counterpart  institutions,  recruiting  consultants,  preparing  and  managing \nimplementation schedules, coordination between and among participating countries, and with \ndevelopment partners. SEID will be supported by a Sida-financed secondee who will report to \nthe task manager and work under the overall direction of the SEID director. The secondee, as a \nmember of the RETA secretariat and, will be responsible for overall coordination of the RETA \nimplementation, ensuring quality outputs and outcomes, providing guidance and coordinating \nwith the other consultants under the other RETA. The Sida secondee will be appointed by Sida \nin consultation with ADB. No activities will be financed under this RETA in any member country \nof ADB unless and until a letter of no objection regarding such activity has been received from \nthe government of such member country. \n \n17.  The head of the RPTCC focal group in each participating country will serve as the focal \npoint and liaise directly with TA secretariat. A RETA working group will be established in each \ncountry,  consisting  of  staff  from  the  country\u2019s  environmental  agency  and  its  power  utility. \nCounterpart agencies will provide all necessary data, information, and support, and will facilitate \nthe work of the secretariat and consultants and provide in-country services for the TA. \n \n18.  The RETA will be implemented by an international consulting firm. ADB will select and \nengage  consultants  in  accordance  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  by  ADB  and  its \nBorrowers (2007, as amended from time to time). The consultant firm will be selected by the \nquality and cost-based selection method, with the ratio between technical qualification and cost \nto be 80:20. All procurement under the RETA will be in accordance with ADB Procurement \nGuidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Equipment and software procured will be \nretained by the counterpart in each participating country after the completion of the RETA. \n \n19.  The RETA will be implemented over 30 months starting 1 March 2008, and will require \n72  person-months  of  international  consulting  inputs  and  72  person-months  of  national \nconsulting inputs. The outline terms of reference for the international consulting firm are in \nAppendix 4. In addition, separate consultancy services will be required for undertaking feasibility \nstudies of identified priority projects. This will be undertaken through an international consulting \nfirm. The consultant will prepare inception, interim, quarterly progress, draft final, and final \nreports covering both components. The RETA outputs will be disseminated by a variety of \nmeans, including website publication, in-country workshops, and electronic reports. \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S RECOMMENDATION \n20.  The  President  recommends  that  the  Board  approve  ADB  administering  technical \nassistance not exceeding the equivalent of $5,000,000 to be financed on grant basis by the \nGovernment  of  Sweden  for  Facilitating  Regional  Power  Trading  and  Environmentally \nSustainable  Development  of  Electricity  Infrastructure  in  the  Greater  Mekong  Subregion.\n ", "    6\n \n \n \n \n \n \n A\np\nDEVELOPMENT MATRIX  p\ne\nn\nd\nTask  Stage  Goal  Activities  CWoBu,n GtrMieSsa       ADB/AFDb  ADB/Sidac   ix 1\nA.
