I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed \npolicy-based grant to the Kingdom of Tonga for the Strengthening Public Financial Management \nProgram. \n \n2.  The program is designed to support the medium-term fiscal framework and multiyear \npolicy reform matrix of the Government of Tonga by supporting policies and processes for public \nfinancial management and private sector development.1 \n  \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Rationale \n3.  Tonga  faces  many  of  the  challenges  typical  of  small  island  economies,  such  as \ngeographic isolation, limited human and financial resources, a small domestic market, and high \ntrade  costs.  The  economy  is  narrowly  based  and  depends  on  inflows  of  remittances  and \nexternal assistance to support aggregate demand.  \n \n4.  Since 2007, Tonga has mounted major tax policy, budget, and customs administration \nreforms,  while  strengthening  the  business  regulatory  environment  and  corporatizing  and \nprivatizing  several  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs).  But  the  country\u2019s  geographical \ndisadvantages and high level of vulnerability to climatic, political, and economic shocks have \nconstrained investor potential, leading to more modest growth rates than the government had \nanticipated.  Investor  confidence  was  eroded  by  a  prolonged  civil  service  strike  and  civil \ndisturbances that caused widespread damage to the capital, Nuku\u2019alofa, in 2006. Tonga also \nsuffered from a tsunami in September 2009 and cyclones in 2010 and 2012. Reconstruction \nactivity  boosted  the  economy,  but  that  growth  did  not  prove  to  be  self-sustaining.  Heavy \nreconstruction  costs  have  strained  the  government\u2019s  budget,  with  administrative  resources \ndiverted from reform to reconstruction activity.2   \n \n5.  Tonga has had a slow and difficult recovery from the global economic crisis. The crisis \ntriggered a decline in remittances, tourism flows, and exports. Remittances as a percentage of \ngross domestic product (GDP) declined from 30% in fiscal year (FY) 2009 to 15% in FY2012, \nwhile tourist visitor numbers declined by 30% over the same period. Recovery continues to be \nheld  back  by  ongoing  contractions  in  private  sector  credit,  weakening  agricultural  export \nperformance,  and  by  the  series  of  natural  disasters  the  country  has  faced.  Government \nrevenues have been hurt by the growth slowdown, and in FY2013 were 9.0% below FY2009 \nreceipts. Total non-grant revenue is likewise around 34% below FY2009 levels.3  \n \n6.  Despite these adversities, the economy continued to expand after the global economic \ncrisis\u2014recording growth of 3.3% in FY2010 and 2.9% in FY2011\u2014largely driven by grant and \ndebt-financed stimulus as development partners and the government responded to help sustain \naggregate demand. Capital investment and onlending from the Export\u2013Import Bank of China \ncombined to offset some of the impacts of declining revenues. However, as spending began to \nwind down, growth rates declined to 0.8% in FY2012 and 0.5% in FY2013. Private sector \n                                                \n1  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n2  ADB. 2013. Tonga\u2014Pacific Islands Economic Report. Manila. \n3  International Monetary Fund. 2013. Tonga: 2013 Article IV Consultation\u2014Staff Report. Washington, DC. ", "2 \ndevelopment and job growth have been constrained by slow credit growth due to the weak \neconomic outlook and the application of tighter lending standards by increasingly risk-averse \nbanks. Grants have supported continued public spending and service delivery as tax revenue \nhas declined. Budget support receipts were equivalent to 14% of revenue in FY2011, 25% in \nFY2012, and 7.0% in FY2013 (footnote 3). \n \n7.  High levels of external indebtedness make Tonga vulnerable to sudden changes in \ngrowth  and  revenues.  The  2013  World  Bank\u2013International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  Debt \nSustainability Analysis for Tonga assesses Tonga to be at moderate risk of debt distress, an \nimprovement  over the 2012  rating (footnote  3).  Nevertheless,  official  debt repayments  are \nprojected to significantly rise, from T$21 million in FY2013 to T$29 million in FY2014 and T$32 \nmillion in FY2015, placing additional strains on the budget.4  \n \n8.  Tonga\u2019s current strategy for economic and social development is set out in the Tonga \nStrategic Development Framework (TSDF), 2011\u20132014.5 Public sector reform is at the forefront \nof the TSDF, which outlines strategies for (i) fostering a more efficient and effective government \nby  focusing  on  its  core  functions;  (ii)  improving  the  macroeconomic  environment  and \nstrengthening fiscal management; and (iii) ensuring that public enterprises are sustainable and \naccountable and, where appropriate, moved to the private sector. \n \n1.  Government\u2019s Policy Reform Matrix for Budget Support \n9.  In consultation with the IMF, the government developed a medium-term fiscal framework \nto steadily improve fiscal sustainability (see Table 1). Building its cash reserves to 2 months of \noperating payments and keeping external debt below its 35% of GDP target over the medium \nterm are the key fiscal anchors (footnote 4). The fiscal framework was presented in the FY2014 \nBudget and envisages a gradual reduction in the financing gap, after grant aid has been \naccounted for, from 3.7% of GDP in FY2013 to 2.3% of GDP in FY2016 through a combination \nof improved revenue measures and expenditure restraint. \n \nTable 1: Economic and Fiscal Outlook, FY2013\u2013FY2016 \nFY2013  FY2014  FY2015  FY2016 \nItem  FY2011  FY2012 \n(e)  (f)  (f)  (f) \nReal GDP (% change)  2.9  0.8  0.5  1.5  1.7  1.7 \nInflation (% change)  7.1  2.3  3.0  4.0  4.7  5.0 \nExpenditure (% of GDP)  34.0  30.6  23.7  24.3  22.5  21.9 \nFinancing gap (% of GDP)  7.6  2.7  (3.7)  (3.5)  (3.0)  (2.3) \nPersonnel costs (% of total  58.9  63.8  63.1  61.7  60.4  60.1 \nrevenue) \nNet change in cash reserves ($  (4.5)  (10.4)  3.1  0  2.9  0.9 \nmillion) \nExternal public debt (% of GDP)  35.4  41.2  44.6  41.5  38.2  36.0 \nDebt service ratio (% of GDP)  1.2  1.3  1.6  2.5  2.7  2.8 \n ( ) = negative, (e) = estimate, (f) = forecast, FY = fiscal year, GDP = gross domestic product    \nSource: IMF. 2013.

The FY2014 budget shows government expenditure (excluding debt-and grant-financed \nprojects) peaking in FY2014 in real terms and as a proportion of GDP. This slight increase is \n                                                \n4  Government of Tonga. 2013. FY2014 Budget Strategy. Nuku\u2019alofa. \n5  Government of Tonga. 2011.

Restraint in salary expenditure continues with \nwage bill growth of 2.0% lower than projected inflation of 4.0%. There has been no cost of living \nadjustment to public service salaries since 2011. Wage bill growth is also lower than overall \ngrowth in recurrent expenditure (footnote 4). This reflects progress towards the government\u2019s \ngoal of reducing the wage bill to 45% of recurrent spending. \n11.  Change in allocations to specific government ministries are also broadly aligned with \npolicy priorities. The largest proportionate reduction is in the Ministry of Infrastructure budget \nallocation (by 30%), reflecting a resumption of trend expenditure following the completion of \nlarge aid financed projects in the previous budget. The FY2014 allocations for the health and \neducation ministries increased by 4.0% and 6.0% respectively in line with Government policy to \nreallocate expenditure to maintain social sector spending in real terms (footnote 4). \n \n12.  Ongoing dialogue between the government and development partners has resulted in \nthe preparation of a multiyear joint policy reform matrix (JPRM), which outlines shared reform \npriorities that are also linked to the goals of the TSDF. The policy areas covered are public \nfinancial management, fiscal policy and structural reform.  For FY2014, the JPRM includes \nmeasures  aimed  at  strengthening  revenue  mobilization,  expanding  the  use  of  program \nbudgeting, accelerating reform of SOEs and business environment reform. Partners that have \nassisted government to define reform priorities include ADB, the Government of Australia, the \nIMF, the New Zealand Aid Programme, the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre and \nthe World Bank. The multidonor dialogue around budget support has played a key role in \nmobilizing political attention, administrative effort and technical assistance (TA) to implement \nreforms.  \n \n13.  ADB support for implementing the JPRM by strengthening public sector management \nand improving the environment for private sector development\u2014areas of long-standing ADB \ninvolvement\u2014will continue throughout the program. The program is structured around related \noutputs: (i) strengthened public financial management, (ii) strengthened fiscal policy, and (iii) \nimproved implementation of structural reforms, and will be supported by ongoing ADB TA \n(funding of $675,000), which will end in December 2014.6 In 2014, although not providing \nbudget support, ADB will continue to participate in formulating and monitoring the public finance \nreforms. The Government of Australia, the European Commission and the World Bank will \ncontinue to provide financial support to assist the government in meeting its financing gap. \nAdvisors from regional TA projects,7 the World Bank and Pacific Financial Technical Assistance \nCentre will also help the government accomplish the policy actions contained in the JPRM by \n2014. \n \n14.  The program will build on lessons and outcomes of ADB\u2019s Economic Support Program to \nTonga,8 which was completed in June 2011. Public sector management and private sector \ndevelopment actions that were achieved under the Economic Support Program include the \nimplementation of medium-term budgeting reforms, formulation and tracking of financial ratios to \nguide budget formulation, compliance with new debt management policies and procedures, \nremoval  of  parliamentarians  and  civil  servants  from  SOE  boards,  and  establishment  of  a \n                                                \n6  ADB. 2011.

In recognition of the good progress being made \nby all development partners towards adoption of a medium term view of program and project \nassistance, ADB will adopt a programmatic approach for future budget support programs in \nTonga. \n \n2.  Public Sector Financial Management \n15.  Performance  indicators  of  public  financial  management  in  Tonga  have  shown  an \nimprovement  in  recent  years.  In  the  2007  Public  Expenditure  and  Financial  Accountability \n(PEFA) assessment, Tonga received 16 ratings of \u201cC\u201d or better out of 27 applicable indicators. \nIn the 2010 PEFA assessment, the number of indicators where Tonga scored \u201cC\u201d or better \nincreased to 20. However, the 2010 PEFA highlighted several weaknesses in public financial \nmanagement. Coverage of in-year budget reports was singled out as an area for improvement \nbecause the existing reports could not be used to compare actual and forecast revenues and \nexpenditures,  thus  weakening  control  of  budget  execution.  Links  between  budgets  and \ncorporate plans were weak, and procurement suffered from insufficient oversight and poor \nregulatory compliance. \n16.  Since  2010,  the  government  has  taken  important  steps  to  improve  public  financial \nmanagement. A medium-term fiscal framework was developed to underpin medium-term fiscal \nplanning. Line ministry corporate plans were revised to focus on priority programs with clearly \ndefined  performance  targets  and  resource  requirements.  Government  ministries  were \nrestructured  in  2012  to  better  align  organizations  with  the  priority  functions  identified  in \ncorporate programs. \n3.  Fiscal Policy \n17.  Room for fiscal maneuver is constrained by the high wage bill, public debt overhang \n(including sharply increasing debt service commitments in FY2014) and narrow revenue base. \nSince 2010, the government has taken steps to reduce tax exemptions and to broaden the tax \nbase. Planned tax reforms could cause an increase in revenues by around 0.5% of GDP per \nannum in FY2014\u2013FY2016, which is sufficient to safeguard fiscal sustainability if government \nexpenditures  are  restrained  at  levels  planned  in  the  government\u2019s  medium-term  fiscal \nframework and allowing for continued budget support assistance at similar levels to those seen \nsince FY2011 (footnote 3). To help reduce the public debt, the government is strictly restricting \nall new borrowing and guarantees. \n \n18.  To  strengthen  management  of  the  wage  bill,  which  is  currently  50%  of  recurrent \nexpenditure (down from 52% in FY2013), a freeze on new civil service recruitment has been in \neffect since 2010. Vacant posts have been cut back and centralized under the Ministry of \nFinance and within-year reallocation of resources to casual employment has been restricted. \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2012. Completion Report: Economic Support Program in Tonga. Manila. \n10 ADB. 2011. Policy-Based Programs for the Pacific Islands. Manila.  \n ", "5 \nThe Public Service Commission is undertaking organizational and remuneration reviews to bring \nsalary  levels  into  alignment  with  ministry  core  functions  and  available  resources.  Specific \nrecommendations from these reviews will be included in the JPRM for 2014 and will support \nefforts to reduce the wage bill to the government\u2019s target of 45% of government expenditure \n(footnote 4). \n \n4.  Structural Reforms \n19.  Fostering private sector development is essential to boost growth and to help Tonga \nreduce its reliance on inflows of remittances and aid. Tonga\u2019s tourism sector has considerable \nuntapped  potential,  which  continuing  business  environment  reform  and  targeted  donor \nassistance may help unlock. Improving the efficiency of the public enterprises that provide \ninfrastructure  services  could  reduce  business  costs,  as  could  further  efforts  to  reprioritize \ngovernment  expenditure  toward  higher-priority  areas  such  as  agriculture,  fisheries,  and \ninfrastructure. Development of high-speed internet capacity is also expected to create many \nnew business opportunities. \n \n20.  In addition to remoteness and a small domestic market, private sector development is \ndominated by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) whose operations are hampered by \nhigh business costs resulting from an onerous land registration process, weak property rights \nprotection,  limited  access  to  finance,  skill  gaps,  irregular  domestic  aviation  and  shipping \nservices, poorly performing SOEs, and gaps in the commercial legal framework. While modest \nlevels of credit growth is forecast, continued risk aversion on behalf of commercial banks and a \nhigh degree of leveraging within the small private sector constrain access to credit.  \n \n21.  Tonga\u2019s portfolio of 16 public enterprises includes nine infrastructure service providers \nand seven enterprises engaged in commercial activities, with a combined asset value equivalent \nto about 40% of GDP in 2012. However, an ADB study found that in revenue terms, these SOEs \ncontributed just 5.5% to GDP and had an average return on equity of 5.6% from 2002 to 2010.11 \nSince 2010, portfolio performance has declined\u2014return on equity for the 2012 reporting period \nwas just 4.5%.12 The Tongan Public Enterprises Act, as amended in 2010, provides a sound \nlegislative framework that supports good governance, encourages a strong commercial focus, \nand establishes strong accountabilities and transparency. Further implementation of the act, \nstrict enforcement of community service obligations, divestiture of poorly performing SOEs, \nincreased contracting-out, and stronger board accountability for results could contribute to more \nrobust SOE performance. \n \n22.  Tonga\u2019s efforts to reform commercial law have focused on reforming business licensing \nand encouraging investment in specific sectors. The Business License Amendment Act of 2012 \nallows for licenses by businesses in perpetuity instead of licensing by activity. Further reforms \nare needed to reduce the number of ancillary licenses required by various regulatory agencies, \nand to improve the registration of business names. Changes are also required to the insolvency \nregime to improve timeliness, reduce costs, and establish clear procedures for dealing with \nfirms in financial distress. \n \n                                                \n11  ADB. 2011. Finding Balance 2011: Benchmarking the Performance of State-owned Enterprises in Fiji, Marshall \nIslands, Samoa, Solomon Islands and Tonga. Manila. \n12 Although the return on equity is based mainly on audited accounts for FY2012, the Ministry of Public Enterprises \nhas concerns over a number of the audits. For example, the return for the Tonga Water Board is probably \noverstated due to its treatment of donor funds. \n ", "6 \nB.  Impact and Outcome \n23.  The impact of the program will be the achievement of fiscal stability as prioritized in the \nTSDF. The impact will be assessed against the achievement of the government\u2019s target for \nexternal debt, which will be reported on in the government budget and in the IMF Article IV staff \nreports. The outcome will be a more sustainable fiscal position as well as improvement in \neconomic management and quality of budgetary and financial management. Progress in fiscal \nstability will be tracked against progress reported in the budget, SOE financial reports, and \nTonga\u2019s country performance assessment scores. \n \nC.  Outputs \n24.  Strengthened public financial management. The program supports the introduction of \nprogram structures in the budget and the undertaking of a comprehensive review of the national \nprocurement policy. Both policy actions have been accomplished. \n \n25.  The government has revised the corporate plans of the ministries and line agencies to \nbetter align them with the core functions of government and to clearly reflect the links between \nprogram goals, objectives, intended outcomes, outputs, and required resources over a 3-year \nrolling period. In 2011 and 2012, several of the ministries were restructured to better align their \norganizational  structures  with  the  program  functions  of  their  corporate  plans.  The  FY2014 \nbudget reflects this, and the major programs are stated in the budget document. This provides a \nbasis for program budgeting and better alignment between expenditures and policy priorities. \nAligning corporate plan priorities with budget allocation also encourages the ministries to shed \nnoncore functions, and to concentrate resources on achieving agreed program targets.  \n \n26.  A comprehensive review of the design and implementation of Tonga\u2019s procurement \npolicies and procedures was undertaken by a team of experts financed by the Government of \nAustralia at the request of the Ministry of Finance. This review has singled out several areas \nthat require strengthening, including the appointment and training of procurement officers in the \nline ministries, record-keeping and information management systems, finalizing of procurement \nregulations, and demarcation between staff recruitment and goods and services procurement. \nFollow-up measures will be mounted in 2014 and beyond. \n \n27.  Strengthened fiscal policy. The program supports the introduction of a presumptive tax \non SMEs and an extractive industries tax. Both policy actions have been accomplished. \n \n28.  The presumptive tax on SMEs will improve collection and lower compliance costs from \nbusiness taxes for most Tongan enterprises. It will significantly reduce the administrative burden \non SMEs in that they will no longer need to maintain extensive records and file a complex \ncompany tax return. It is expected to contribute to better tax compliance and more formalization \nof small companies. The extractive industries tax creates an internationally competitive regime \nfor royalties, corporate tax, and excess profit tax for companies that are currently prospecting for \ndeep-sea copper deposits. This is needed to provide confidence to those who are investing, \nwhile ensuring a fair distribution of the returns from mining. Cabinet has approved submission to \nParliament of both bills. \n \n29.  Improved implementation of structural reforms. The program supports the liquidation \nof Tonga Investment Limited and the sale of its Home Gas retail operations to Tonga Power \nLimited;  the  preparation  of  a  reform  and  restructuring  plan  for  Tonga  Communications \nCorporation; the preparation of a plan for private sector participation in the management of the \n ", "7 \nInternational Dateline Hotel; steady progress in fostering good corporate governance of state \nenterprises by preparing a skills-based appointment process for SOE directors, by government \nhonoring its community service obligations to the SOEs, and by around 60% of SOEs publishing \nup-to-date audited financial reports; and improvements in the commercial law framework for \nprivate sector development through the development of receivership legislation and a proposed \namendment to the Registration of Business Names Act, 2002. All six policy actions have been \naccomplished. \n \n30.  The sale of the Home Gas retail operations of Tonga Investment to Tonga Power is \ndesigned to improve power services to consumers and to enhance Tonga Power\u2019s ability to \nbetter  align  different  power  sources  with  consumer  requirements.  Liquidation  of  Tonga \nInvestment will wind up what has long been a defunct enterprise. Private sector participation in \nthe International Dateline Hotel is designed to upgrade facilities and restore to profitability the \ncapital\u2019s largest hotel, improving the country\u2019s international image and encouraging tourism. \nNew systems for selecting SOE directors are aimed at ensuring that those appointed to senior \nSOE management do have the requisite knowledge and skills required to effectively lead those \nfirms. Ensuring that the government honors its commitment to funding its community service \nobligations rather than directing SOEs to provide uneconomical services will help improve the \ncommercial orientation and performance of the state companies. Steady progress made in \npreparing and publishing SOE annual reports enhances the transparency and accountability of \nthese firms. \n \n31.  Preparation of a new business name legislation is part of the process of streamlining and \nreducing the costs of business licensing. The proposed amendment to the Registration of \nBusiness Names Act will streamline the name registration process, reduce compliance costs, \nand provide for efficient electronic registration. The receivership bill will establish an effective \nframework  for  determining  the  respective  rights  and  liabilities  of  receivers,  creditors,  and \ngrantors. It is designed to establish clear receivership procedures and to make receivership \nmore attractive to liquidation in certain situations. This bill is also one of the building blocks for a \nmore effective bankruptcy system, which is to be introduced in 2014. Cabinet has approved \nsubmission to Parliament of the proposed amendment and bill. \n \nD.  Development Financing Needs \n  \n32.  The government has requested a grant not exceeding $4.5 million from ADB\u2019s Special \nFunds resources to help finance the program. \n \n33.  ADB  is  basing  the  size  of  its  $4.5  million  grant  on  the  government\u2019s  financing \nrequirements, the cost of the government\u2019s reform efforts and the budget support to be provided \nby other partners. The government\u2019s financing requirements for its fiscal reform program is \nforecast to amount to $17.2 million in FY2014, $15.7 million in FY2015, and $12.9 million in \nFY2016. While this is not a cofinancing arrangement, the program will be an integral part of a \njoint undertaking with other development partners providing assistance to help meet the funding \ngap. For FY2014, the Government of Australia has agreed to provide $5.0 million, the European \nUnion has agreed to provide $3.5 million, and the World Bank has agreed to provide $5.0 million \nto support implementation of the JPRM measures (footnote 4). \n \nE.  Implementation Arrangements \n34.  Program management. The Ministry of Finance and National Planning (MFNP) will be \nthe executing agency and will oversee and coordinate the timely implementation of agreed \n ", "8 \npolicy actions. The implementing agencies will be the MFNP; Ministry of Public Enterprises; \nMinistry of Commerce, Tourism and Labor; and Ministry of Revenue and Customs. Each will be \nresponsible  for  undertaking  the  policy  actions  or  program  activities  that  fall  within  its \nresponsibilities. Resources from ongoing TA will support the government in implementing the \nJPRM.  The  MFNP,  through  its  Budget  Support  Management  Committee,  will  also  be \nresponsible for program administration, disbursements, and maintenance of all program records. \nADB  and  other  development  partners  will  work  through  the  Budget  Support  Management \nCommittee mechanism to monitor progress, oversee the implementation of the government\u2019s \nreform program, and guide and direct the activities of the executing agency. \n \n35.  Implementation  period.  The  program  will  be  implemented  from  31  January  to \n31 December 2013, consistent with the government\u2019s medium-term fiscal framework. Policy and \noperational changes agreed with the government and set out in the policy matrix were put in \nplace from 31 January to 31 July 2013. \n \n36.  Procurement  and  disbursement.  The  proceeds  of  the  grant  will  be  disbursed  in \naccordance with ADB\u2019s simplification of disbursement procedures and related requirements for \npolicy-based grants.13 The proceeds will be used to finance the foreign exchange cost of items \nproduced and procured in ADB member countries, excluding items included in a list of ineligible \nitems  and  imports  financed  by  other  bilateral  and  multilateral  sources.14 Grant  proceeds \ndisbursed against imports will require a certificate from the government stipulating that the value \nof the total imports of Tonga, minus its imports from nonmember countries, ineligible imports \nand imports financed under other official development assistance, is greater than the amount of \nthe grant expected to be disbursed during a particular year. ADB will have the right to audit the \nuse of the grant proceeds and to verify the accuracy of the government\u2019s certification. \n \n37.  Tranches. The grant will be provided in a single tranche and may be withdrawn upon \nsatisfaction of grant effectiveness conditions, i.e., fulfillment of all the actions in the policy matrix. \n \n38.  Counterpart funds. Local currency generated from the grant will be directed to the \ngovernment\u2019s bank account with the National Bank of Tonga to allow assistance toward the \nFY2014 budget. \n \n39.  Program performance monitoring and evaluation. The Budget Support Committee of \nthe MFNP will establish a performance evaluation system for the program within 3 months from \ngrant effectiveness and maintain this. The MFNP will monitor the program and report to ADB on \nthe implementation of policy actions and their impact on budget outcomes, in line with the \nimpact and outcome indicators agreed upon with the government. A review will take place at \nmidterm and the government will ensure that ADB will have the opportunity to participate in this \nreview. Because the impact of the program will be felt beyond the period of its implementation, \nthe MFNP will continue monitoring performance until the end of 2014. The information will be \nincluded in the completion report. \n \n                                                \n13 ADB. 1998. Simplification of Disbursement Procedures and Related Requirements for Program Loans. Manila. \n14 List of Ineligible Items (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", "9 \nIII.  DUE DILIGENCE \n40.  The program\u2019s major benefit will be its contribution to the government\u2019s goal of fiscal \nstability.  The  program  will  assist  the  government  in  restoring  fiscal  stability  through \nimprovements in public financial management, fiscal policy, and sustained implementation of \nstructural reforms to raise productivity\u2014all features of the government\u2019s policy reform matrix. \nThese  improvements  will  help  alleviate  the  debt  overhang,  improve  the  quality  of  public \nspending, allow maintenance of the current level of health and education services, and improve \nthe climate for doing business. Stronger public financial management will also improve service \ndelivery, which is essential to making the growth process inclusive and to fostering employment \nand poverty reduction. \n \nA.  Economic and Financial \n41.  Improving  the  link  between  ministry  spending  and  the  overall  government  budget, \nstrengthening the government\u2019s revenue position, and reducing SOEs\u2019 demands on the budget \nwill create fiscal space and allow the government to shift expenditures to priority areas. Budget \nrestraint and strengthened fiscal management will allow the government to lower its debt burden \nand reduce its vulnerability to fiscal shocks. The program\u2019s long-term impact will be a more \nsustainable fiscal position, which implies that the government achieves its medium-term external \ndebt target of 35% of GDP by FY2017 as set out in its medium-term budget framework. \n \nB.  Governance \n42.  The  government\u2019s  ability  to  implement  its  budget  is  integral  to  the  success  of  the \nprogram.  The  2010  PEFA  assessment  for  Tonga  found  several  areas  of  weakness  in \ngovernment  budgeting,  revenue  mobilization,  procurement,  and  expenditure  controls.  The \nJPRM's emphasis on improving public financial management demonstrates the government\u2019s \nstrong commitment to eliminating deficiencies and managing the budget credibly and effectively. \n \n43.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith the government and the MFNP. Consistent with its commitment to good governance, \naccountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or through its \nagents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the program. \n \nC.  Poverty and Social \n44.  Although not directly targeting the poor, stronger public financial management will have \npositive impacts on the delivery of social services, economic infrastructure, and other core \npublic services. It will also contribute to macroeconomic stability, augment aggregate demand, \nand  improve  the  business  environment,  all  of  which  are  necessary  to  induce  investment, \nemployment, and livelihoods needed to reduce poverty.  \n \nD.  Safeguards \n45.  Program activities will be confined to policy and institutional reforms, and none of the \nactivities will result in or lead to involuntary resettlement or affect indigenous peoples. No \nadverse  environmental impacts  have  been  identified.  In  compliance with  ADB\u2019s  Safeguard \nPolicy  Statement  (2009),  the  program  is  classified  under  category  C  for  impacts  on  the \nenvironment, involuntary resettlement, and indigenous peoples. Public consultation has been \ncarried out while processing of the program and during fact finding. \n ", "10 \n \nE.  Risks and Mitigating Measures \n46.  The program faces three key risks: (i) political consensus needed to mount fiscal and \nSOE management reforms proves more difficult to achieve than anticipated given elections in \n2014;  (ii) staff  turnover  leaves  insufficient  qualified  and  experienced  personnel  to  manage \nimplementation of program elements; and (iii) given a high degree of vulnerability to shocks, \nfiscal outcomes could diverge from what is anticipated in the budget. Major risks and mitigating \nmeasures are described in detail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.15 \n \n47.  The program is designed to mitigate these risks. Political consensus will be obtained and \nsustained  through  government  ownership  and  leadership  of  the  JPRM  process  and  by \ncontinuous outreach to parliamentarians and the public, to build wider stakeholder support for \nreform. There is already a high level of media coverage and public awareness about the need \nfor economic reforms and the role of development partners in supporting the government\u2019s \nefforts through budget support and TA. To help offset the risk of skills shortages, government \nstaff resources will be supplemented with ongoing TA provided by ADB and other partners. \nQuarterly monitoring of reform progress and the fiscal situation will enable the government to \nmake necessary adjustments to the budget should unanticipated shocks occur. \n \nIV.  ASSURANCES \n48.  The government and the MFNP have assured ADB that implementation of the program \nwill conform to all applicable ADB policies, including those concerning anticorruption measures, \nsafeguards, gender, procurement, consulting services, and disbursement as described in detail \nin the grant agreement. \n \n49.  The government and the MFNP have agreed with ADB on certain covenants for the \nprogram, which are set forth in the grant agreement. The grant will become effective after ADB \nis satisfied that all conditions for the release of the program tranche, as specified in the policy \nmatrix and set out in Attachment 2 to Schedule 2 of the grant agreement, have been complied \nwith. \n \nV.  RECOMMENDATION \n50.  I am satisfied that the proposed policy-based grant would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and recommend that the Board approve the \ngrant not exceeding $4,500,000 to the Kingdom of Tonga from ADB\u2019s Special Funds resources \nfor the Strengthening Public Financial Management Program, on terms and conditions that are \nsubstantially in accordance with those set forth in the draft grant agreement presented to the \nBoard. \n \n \nTakehiko Nakao \nPresident \n2 September 2013 \n                                                \n15 Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2).  \n \n ", "Appendix 1  11   \n \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK  \n  Data Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nFiscal stability is  Government achieves its  IMF Article IV staff  Private sector \nachieved  medium-term external debt-to- reports  contribution to GDP \n  GDP target of 35% by FY2017    grows \n(FY2013 baseline: 40.3% of  Annual budget papers   \nGDP)    Government \nADB country  maintains its \nperformance  commitment to \nassessment reports  medium-term fiscal \n  strategy and fiscal \n  responsibility ratios \n \nRisks \nPolitical consensus to \nmount reforms wanes \n \nHigh turnover of \ntrained staff in the \nMinistry of Finance \nand National Planning \nOutcome  Revenue mobilization reaches  FY2014\u2013FY2017  Assumptions \nSustainable fiscal  20% of GDP by FY2016  budget estimates  Government fulfills its \nposition  (FY2013 baseline: 18.2%)    commitment to \n  Annual reports of  improving fiscal \nSustainable fiscal outturn  public enterprises   stability \nmaintained over FY2014\u2013    \nFY2016 (FY2013 baseline:  Auditor general\u2019s  Continued \noverall balance excluding  reports   implementation of \ngrants and concessionary    structural reform \nloans not to exceed a deficit of  Future PEFA reports  program  \n3.3% of GDP)     \n  Annual IMF Article IV  Risks \nImprovements in the PEFA  reports  A credible budget will \nratings for Tonga, that is, from    not be produced  \n\u201cC\u201d to \u201cC+\u201d (2010 baseline: C   \nfor composition of expenditure,  Staff changes reduce \nclassification of the budget,  continuity and quality \noversight of aggregate fiscal  of planning \nrisk from other public sector   \nentities, multiyear perspectives  Skilled senior staff \nin fiscal planning, expenditure  already have high \npolicy and budgeting and  workloads \ncompetition, value for money,   \nand controls in procurement)  Limited capacity in the \nMinistry of Public \nEnterprises to monitor \nand ensure \ncompliance \n ", "12  Appendix 1 \nData Sources and \nPerformance Targets and  Reporting  Assumptions \nDesign Summary  Indicators with Baselines  Mechanisms  and Risks \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
