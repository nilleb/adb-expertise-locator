A summary environmental impact assessment was \nAssessment  circulated to the Board and posted on the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) website on 14 April 2008. \n   \nProject Description  The Tianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant \nProject involves constructing and operating a coal-fired integrated \ngasification  combined  cycle  (IGCC)  power  plant  with  250 \nmegawatt capacity in Tianjin Harbor Industrial Park in the Binhai \nNew Area of Tianjin city. This will be the first IGCC clean coal \nproject in the PRC, using the most efficient and least-polluting \ntechnology currently available commercially. It will also be the first \nIGCC power plant in the developing Asia. On completion, the \nplant will generate 1,470 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually, \nwhich will be sold to the Northern China Grid Company Ltd. using \na  220  kilovolt  interconnecting  transmission  line  to  an  existing \nsubstation in the industrial park.  \n \nThe Project is consistent with the priority of the Government of the \nPRC  to  implement  a  coal-fired  power  plant  with  near-zero \nemissions  by  2015  under  its  flagship  clean  coal  program\u2014\nGreenGen\u2014announced in 2005. The Project is a cornerstone of \nthe critical first phase of the GreenGen program. In the second \nphase,  a  scaled-up  IGCC  plant  fitted  with  pilot-scale  carbon \ncapture and storage (CCS) is expected by 2013, and the third \nphase is expected to provide a coal-fired power plant with near-\nzero emissions by 2015. CCS is included in all climate change-\nmitigation  strategies  proposed  by  the  United  Nation's \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the International \nEnergy Agency. Various international studies have found IGCC \npower plants with CCS to be the least-cost option to cut carbon \ndioxide (CO ) emissions from coal-fired power plants by up to \n2\n90%.  By  successfully  demonstrating  the  advantages  of  IGCC \ntechnology, the Project will reinforce confidence in the viability of \nthis  technology  and  enable  the  timely  implementation  of  the \nensuing phases of the GreenGen program.  \n \nRelevant  approvals  for  the  construction  are  in  place.  Project  \ncompletion  is expected by 30 June 2012.  \n ", "ii \nRationale  The PRC is the world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer. Coal \nproduction has increased from 0.98 billion tons (t) in 2000 to 2.74 \nbillion t in 2008, or more than 48% of global production. In the \nPRC,  electricity  is  produced  predominantly  from  coal,  which \ngenerated  81%  of  the  total  electricity  in  2008.  Electricity \ngeneration is the largest single consumer of coal. It consumed \n1.34 billion t (49%) of the coal produced in 2008, with serious \nenvironmental problems and poor air quality caused by related \nemissions\u201450% of the nation\u2019s sulfur dioxide (SO ) emissions, \n2\n36% of its nitrogen oxide (NO ) emissions, and 39% of its CO  \nX   2\nemissions. Acid rain caused primarily by SO  and NO  falls on \n2 x\none-third  of  the  country  and  45%  of  its  farmland.  The  rapid \nincrease in coal consumption has triggered a surge in emissions \nof  CO \u2014a  major  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  and  cause  of  global \n2\nclimate change.  \n \nThe  Government  is  actively  improving  energy  efficiency  and \nshifting  to  non-carbon  and  other  cleaner  energy  sources  to \nimprove  the  country\u2019s  environment  and  help  mitigate  global \nclimate change. The Renewable Energy Law, enacted in 2006, \nbrought unprecedented growth in wind, solar, and biomass power \ngeneration. Carbon-free nuclear power is expected to grow many \nfolds. The PRC already has the largest hydropower capacity in the \nworld, which is expected to grow substantially. Despite efforts to \nchange the energy mix, coal is expected to remain dominant in \nelectricity production in the near future.  \n \nTo improve the efficiency of and reduce emissions from coal-fired \npower  plants,  the  PRC  is  (i)  rapidly  closing  small,  inefficient \nplants,  as  indicated  by  the  closing  of  54  gigawatts  of  such \ncapacity  in  the  past  3  years  alone;  (ii)  constructing  new \nsupercritical and ultra-supercritical (USC) plants with advanced \ntechnology  that  offer  efficiency  comparable  to  international \nstandards; and (iii) accelerating the application of flue gas de-\nsulfurization. The development of coal-fired IGCC power plants \nhas been slow, though they can offer 4%\u20135% higher efficiency \nthan  USC  plants.  So  far,  no  industrial-scale  IGCC  plant  is \noperating  in  the  PRC.  Higher  capital  and,  operation  and \nmaintenance  (O&M)  costs  (affecting  electricity  tariffs),  and \ntechnology risks are cited as key barriers. IGCC technology is, \nhowever, gaining momentum in part because of the opportunity of \ncombining it with CCS to cut emissions drastically.  \n \nThe  Project  will  demonstrate  a  key  enabling  technology  with \npotential for large GHG emission reductions from coal usage in \nthe  largest  coal-consuming  country  in  the  world.  ADB  project \nsupport will provide additional technical due diligence and help \nmitigate associated risks, strengthen compliance with safeguard \npolicies,  and  thereby  establish  appropriate  benchmarks  and \nstandards  for  future  IGCC  projects.  The  successful \nimplementation  of  the  Project will lead to scaled-up IGCC power ", "iii \n  plants and trigger the next phases of the GreeGen program, with \nthe potential for very large reductions in GHG emissions from \ncoal-fired power plants in PRC.   \n \nImpact and Outcome  The impact of the Project will be reduced GHG emissions from \ncoal-fired  power  plants.  The  outcome  will  be  expanded \ndeployment of IGCC plants. \n   \nProject Investment Plan   The investment cost of the Project is estimated at $419.59 million, \ninclusive of physical and price contingencies ($22.50 million) and \nfinancial charges during development ($22.10 million).  \n   \nFinancing Plan  A loan of $135 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources will \nbe provided under ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-\nbased lending facility. The loan will have a 26-year term, including \na grace period of 6 years. The long grace period of 6 years, when \ncompared with a 3-year construction period, is proposed as part of \nthe  innovative  support  to  this  project  demonstrating  new \ntechnology during its initial years of operation. The loan will be \nsubject to interest to be determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility, the applicable commitment charge, \nand such other terms and conditions set forth in the loan and \nproject agreements. ADB provides flexibility in terms of currency \nand interest rate swaps during the financing period, in accordance \nwith relevant loan regulations and loan and project agreements.  \n \nADB's Climate Change Fund (CCF) will provide a grant of $5 \nmillion to finance some key components to mitigate risk.  \n   \nAllocation and Relending  The Borrower of ADB loan will be the PRC. Loan proceeds will be \nTerms  relent  by  the  Borrower  through  the  Ministry  of  Finance  to  the \nExport-Import Bank of China (EXIM Bank) on the same terms and \nconditions as the loan between ADB and the PRC. EXIM Bank \nwill, in turn, onlend these loan proceeds to China Huaneng Group \n(CHNG)  on  similar  loan  terms  as  the  EXIM  Bank  loan  and \nadditionally include a standard administration fee of 0.15% for \nproviding these onlending services. CHNG, through an onlending \nagreement, will then onlend the loan proceeds to the Greengen \nCompany Ltd (Greengen), who in turn will onlend it to Huaneng \nTianjin IGCC Company Ltd. (HTICL) as the implementing agency \n(IA) under a subsequent onlending agreement, which again will \nincorporate the same terms and conditions as CHNG's agreement \nwith EXIM Bank. HTICL shall bear the risk of currency and interest \nrate fluctuation. \n   \nPeriod of Utilization   \n(Loan)  31 December 2012 \n(Grant)  31 December 2015 \n   \nEstimated Project  30 June 2012 (Loan)  \nCompletion Date  30 June 2015 (Grant) \n ", "iv \nImplementation  The EXIM Bank acts as the principal onlending agency. CHNG \nArrangements  will be the Executing Agency (EA). CHNG is the managing partner \nof Greengen, which established the project company HTICL in \nTianjin for the construction, operation, and maintenance of the \npower plant. HTICL was registered as a limited liability company \nunder PRC law in November 2008. While HTICL is a separate \nlegal  entity,  Greengen  management  actively  provides \nmanagement oversight to HTICL. A project implementation unit \n(PIU) established in HTICL will regularly monitor implementation \nprogress.  The  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  manager \nresponsible for day to day implementation and the preparation of \nprogress  reports.  The  PIU  will  be  assisted  by  a  team  of \ninternational and national consultants to enhance its capacity with \nregard  to  safeguard  compliance  and  for  project  management, \nmonitoring, and reporting.  \n   \nExecuting Agency  China Huaneng Group  \n   \nProcurement  Project procurement will be carried out in accordance with ADB's \nProcurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). \nAdvance contracting for the Project was approved in August 2008. \nCHNG and HTICL have requested retroactive financing for the \nprocurement  of  goods,  works,  and  consulting  services.  The \namount to be retroactively financed will not exceed 20% of the \nloan  amount  and  will  be  effective  for  reasonable  expenditures \nincurred before loan effectiveness but not earlier than 12 months \nbefore the signing date of the loan agreement. \n   \nConsulting Services  Consulting  services  for  16  person-months\u20144  international  and  \n12 national\u2014will be provided to assist HTICL with the Project's \nimplementation, especially regarding compliance with safeguards, \nand  in  project  management,  monitoring,  and  reporting.  All \nconsultants  will  be  selected  and  engaged  in  accordance  with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended \nfrom time to time). \n   \nProject Benefits and  The Project is financially viable and economically attractive. The \nBeneficiaries  financial internal rate of return is 6.4%, which is higher than the \n  weighted average cost of capital of 3.7%. The economic internal \nrate of return is 16.5%, higher than the ADB minimum rate of \n12%. Sensitivity tests and risk analysis show that the Project will \nbe economically and financially viable even under a combination \nof adverse scenarios. Potential carbon offset revenues under the \nClean Development Mechanism will further improve the financial \nand economic benefits from the Project. \n \n  The Project will demonstrate an innovative and advanced clean \ncoal IGCC technology that will be tested for the first time in the \nPRC. The Project will have significant environmental benefits with \nreduced emissions of major air pollutants like SO , NO , and total \n2 x\nsuspended  particulates  (TSP) as  compared with a  conventional ", "v \n  power  plant.  The  estimated  annual  emissions  avoided  by  the \nProject are 43 t of TSP, 1,237 t of SO , and 3,325 t of NO . The \n2 x\nProject will reduce annual coal consumption by 134,000 t and CO  \n2\nemissions by 372,000 t, with associated global climate benefits. \nThe  Project  is  expected  to  use  35%  less  cooling  water  and \ngenerate significantly less solid waste than a conventional plant.    \n \nThe Project has acquired 20 hectares of land reclaimed from the \nBohai Sea in an existing industrial park and therefore does not \nentail any resettlement. Based on ADB's safeguard policies, it is \ncategory C in terms of involuntary resettlement and indigenous \npeople impacts. The Project will provide indirect social benefits \nthrough improved air quality in the project area. During project \nconstruction, the peak number of workers may reach 1,000.  \n   \nRisks and Assumptions  Project  implementation  carries  risks  inherent  in  any  project \ndemonstrating  an  advanced  technology  for  the  first  time  in  a  \ncountry. While all the major components of the Project have been \npilot  tested  or  established  commercially  and  are  in  successful \noperation  in  the  PRC,  these  components  have  not  yet  been \ncombined in a reliable industrial-sized IGCC power plant. This \nfirst-of-a-kind risk exists in this demonstration project, especially \nduring  the  first  2  years  of  operation.  The  risk  is  substantially \nreduced with the help of a $5 million grant from ADB's CCF that \nwill sponsor the assistance of the coal gasifier and gas turbine \nsuppliers  in  O&M  for  the  initial  2  years.  The  suppliers'  direct \nsupervision  and  support  during  this  critical  phase,  financed \nthrough the grant, will (i) provide enhanced technical expertise at \nshort  notice;  (ii)  help  quickly  diagnose  problems;  and  (iii) \nstrengthen the quality of O&M, which will help the Project quickly \nstabilize at its designed performance level. \n \nThe  major  change  in  an  IGCC  power  plant  compared  with  a \nconventional plant is the introduction of coal gasification. Coal \ngasification  is  a  mature  technology  widely  used  in  chemical \nindustries  in  the  PRC.  The  Project  will  use  a  domestically \ndeveloped  coal  gasifier,  which  is  a  scaled-up  version  of  a \nprototype that was extensively tested on the same coal type. To \nfurther mitigate risks associated with the reliability of the installed \ncoal  gasifier,  the  Project  will  have  interconnection  with  two \nsimilarly  sized  imported  coal  gasifiers  that  are  installed  in  a \nchemical  factory  next  to  the  project  site.  This  connection  will \nprovide backup in case the gasifier breaks down, thus ensuring \nthe reliability of electricity supply from the Project.  \n \nProject implementation risks are minimal. It will be implemented \nby a very experienced and capable group of large power and coal \ncompanies, with strong support from the Government. The EA, \ndesign institutes, and key suppliers have extensive experience \nand  expertise  in  designing,   constructing,  and  managing  large \n ", "vi \n  coal-fired  power  plants.  CHNG,  Greengen  and  HTICL  have \nundertaken  an  extensive  recruitment  and  training  program  for \nengineers and operators with chemical engineering background to \ncomplement its extensive thermal power plant expertise. Key staff \nhas been trained on the O&M of a similar IGCC power plant in \nSpain.  The  trained  staff  will  improve  the  sustainability  of  the \nProject and minimize risks. \n \n  Electricity tariffs in the PRC are regulated and set nationally by the \nNational Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). As this \nis the first IGCC power plant, the cost estimates and proposed \ntariff  were  rigorously  reviewed  during  NDRC\u2019s  approval  of  the \nfeasibility report. The Project is financially viable at the tariff of \nCNY0.56/kilowatt-hour  proposed  in  the  feasibility  report.  The \nelectricity tariff for the Project will be announced by NDRC only at \nproject  completion.  Since  NDRC  has  already  reviewed  and \napproved the feasibility report, the risk of any tariff lower than in \nthe feasibility report is minimal.   \n   \nGrant Assistance   Grant  assistance  is  proposed  from  CCF  not  exceeding  the \nequivalent of $5 million. The grant will be utilized for the (i) coal \ngasifier\u2019s and gas turbines\u2019 long-term maintenance contracts with \ntheir respective suppliers, (ii) civil work contract associated with \nthe  air  separation  unit  of  the  chemical  island  plants,  and  (iii) \nrecruitment of international and national consultants to supervise \nthe  Project's  implementation.  The  grant  assistance  will \nsignificantly  reduce  risks  and  strengthen  project  management \ncapacity and reporting on compliance with key safeguards. ", " \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on (i) a proposed \nloan, and (ii) a proposed grant to be provided by ADB's Climate Change Fund (CCF), both to \nthe People's Republic of China (PRC) for the Tianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle \n(IGCC) Power Plant Project. The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.  \n \nII.  RATIONALE: SECTOR PERFORMANCE, PROBLEMS, AND OPPORTUNITIES \n \nA.  Performance Indicators and Analysis   \n2.  The PRC has sustained impressive economic growth averaging 9.5% for the past 2 \ndecades. Compared with 2000, its gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to double by 2010 \nand quadruple by 2020. The PRC's energy consumption increased to 2.85 billion tons (t) of \nstandard coal equivalent by end-2008, about 20% of global energy consumption and 121% \nhigher  than  the  1.29  billion  t  of  standard  coal  equivalent  consumed  in  2000.1 Given  the \nprojected growth trajectory and relatively low per capita energy consumption of 0.72 t of oil \nequivalent (toe) per annum, the PRC's demand for energy is expected to increase rapidly. Coal \nis the dominant source of primary energy, contributing 70% in 2008, which is significantly higher \nthan the world average of 26%.2  \n \n3.  The PRC is the world\u2019s largest coal producer and consumer, as well as a net energy \nimporter, mainly of oil and gas. In 2008, crude oil imports were more than 178 million t. The \nPRC's reliance on imported oil has now increased to more than 50% of total oil consumption. \nThe consistently increasing demand for energy has impacted upon energy security and may \nbecome a barrier to sustained economic growth.3 A key priority in the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) \n2006\u20132010 is to lower energy intensity by 20%.4 At the end of 2008, energy intensity had fallen \nby 9% compared with 2005.5 By international standards, energy intensity in the PRC is still \nrelatively high at about 0.92 toe, compared with 0.21 toe for the United States and 0.15 toe for \nJapan.  \n \n4.  The rapid pace of economic growth has created strong demand for electricity. Per capita \nelectricity consumption increased from 993 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2000 to 2,650 kWh in 2008.6 \nAfter the United States, the PRC has the second-largest electricity industry in the world. Both \ninstalled generation capacity and actual electricity generation increased at an annual average \nrate of more than 8% over the past 2 decades. Since 2001, electricity demand has increased at \nan average rate of more than 13%. This increase caused serious power shortages in many \nareas of the PRC, which were overcome with an accelerated program of adding more capacity. \nTotal installed capacity has now reached 792.5 gigawatts (GW), and electricity generation has \nincreased to 3,433 terawatt-hours (TWh). The current growth trajectory has installed capacity \nreaching more than 1,000 GW by 2012.  \n \n                                                 \n1  National Bureau of Statistics of China. 2009. Statistical Communiqu\u00e9 of the People's Republic of China on the \n2008 National Economic and Social Development. Beijing.   \n2 All PRC energy data in this document were taken from the National Bureau of Statistics of China unless otherwise \nnoted; international data is generally based on International Energy Agency data unless otherwise noted. \n3 The global financial crisis slowed energy demand growth in 2008 to a moderate increase of 5%. \n4  Energy intensity is the amount of primary energy consumed per $1,000 of GDP. \n5  In 2008 alone, energy intensity fell by 4.6%. During the first half of 2009, a further reduction of 3% was reported. \nThese trends mean the PRC is expected to meet its 11th FYP target of 20% reduction by 2010.    \n6  Annual per capita electricity consumption in the PRC of 2,650 kWh was still about a quarter of the 10,000 kWh in \nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in 2008. \n ", "2   \n5.  In the PRC, electricity is produced predominantly by coal, which is the most carbon-\nintensive fossil fuel.7 In 2008, coal-fired power plants produced 81% of total electricity. Coal \nproduction increased from 0.98 billion t in 2000 to 2.74 billion t in 2008, more than 48% of world \nproduction. The electricity sector is the largest consumer of coal. It consumed 1.34 billion t \n(49%) of the coal produced in 2008, which has caused serious environmental problems. Coal \nconsumption is the major cause of poor air quality. The electricity sector now produces 50% of \nthe nation\u2019s sulfur dioxide (SO ) emissions, 36% of its nitrogen oxide (NO )emissions, and 39% \n2 X  \nof its carbon dioxide (CO ) emissions. Acid rain caused primarily by SO  and NO  falls on one \n2 2 x\nthird of the country and 45% of its farmland. In 2008, among 519 PRC cities with monitored air \nquality, only 399 met acceptable air quality (national class II) standards. The rapid increase in \ncoal consumption has triggered a surge in emissions of CO \u2014a major greenhouse gas (GHG).8 \n2\nAs per the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook 20099 the PRC is expected \nto add more than 1,000 GW of new capacity by 2030, of which 70% will be coal-fired. Most of \nthis new capacity is expected before 2020.  \n \n6.  A  more  diversified  energy  mix  with  a  higher  proportion  of  carbon-free  renewable \nsources,  nuclear  power,  and  low-carbon  fossil  fuel  such  as  natural  gas  is  being  actively \npursued.  The  Renewable  Energy  Law,  enacted  in  2006,  provides  financial  incentives  and \nregulations to accelerate the increased use of renewable energy resources such as wind, solar \nenergy, and biomass. This led to unprecedented growth in wind power capacity within the first 3 \nyears  (2006\u20132008)  of  the  11th  FYP.  The  PRC  now  has  12  GW  of  wind  power  capacity, \ncompared with less than 1 GW at end-2005. Solar power development is expected to reach      \n2 GW by 2011. The 11th FYP also targets 5.5 GW of biomass power development. The \nGovernment  of  the  PRC  has  set  the  goal  to  achieve  15%  of  electricity  generation  from \nrenewable energy sources by 2020 in its renewable energy development plans, promulgated in \nAugust 2007. The current growth momentum of renewable energy is expected to continue and \nmay achieve an even higher target.  \n \nB.  Analysis of Key Problems and Opportunities \n1.  Key Problems and Constraints \n7.  The  PRC  quadrupled  its  GDP  during  1980\u20132000,  but  its  energy  consumption  only \ndoubled. The average energy elasticity of the GDP10 was 0.47. Since 2002, it increased sharply, \npeaking at about 1.6 in 2004, and declined to 0.7 in 2007. The consistently high average energy \nelasticity of GDP of about 0.95 during 2001\u20132007 has led, however, to large energy imports \n(para. 3) with repercussions for energy security. To achieve the target of quadrupling the \neconomy while only doubling energy use between 2000 and 2020, energy elasticity has to be \nbrought down and maintained at below 0.3 over the next 12 years\u2014a very formidable challenge. \nTighter  regulations  and  the  right  incentives  are  required  to  further  lower  energy  intensity. \nInvestment in energy efficiency needs to increase substantially to achieve this target.11  \n \n8.  The  surge  in  new  generation  capacity  to  meet  the  growing  demand  for  electricity \nmaterialized in 260 GW of new power plant capacity in the 3-year period 2006\u20132008, an \n                                                 \n7  Commercial coal has a carbon content of at least 70%; natural gas is almost half as carbon-intensive as coal.  \n8  As per the United Nations IPCC, GHGs are primarily responsible for global climate change. In the PRC, per capita \nGHG emissions are still small compared with those of OECD countries, but the PRC is now the largest GHG \nemitter. \n9  International Energy Agency. 2008. World Energy Outlook 2008. Paris. \n10 Energy elasticity of GDP is the ratio of the rate of growth in energy consumption to the rate of growth of GDP. \n11 Energy efficiency is the ratio of energy consumption per unit of output, e.g., grams of standard coal equivalent per \nkWh of electricity generated in a coal-fired power plant. ", "  3\nincrease  of  more  than  50%  over  the  installed  capacity  of  508  GW  in  2005.  While  large \nrenewable non-hydro energy capacity was added during this period (para. 6), 217 GW of new \ncoal-fired  generation  capacity  was  installed  during  the  same  period.  The  current  growth \ntrajectory of coal use for power plants is environmentally unsustainable. The rapid increase in \ncoal consumption, by more than 250% in the past 6 years, raises serious concerns about SO , \n2\nNO ,  and  incremental  CO   emissions  and  their  local,  regional,  and  global  impacts. \nX 2\nEnvironmental problems are aggravated as large quantities of waste coal accumulate near \npitheads.12  \n \n9.  Improved energy efficiency in electricity generation through advanced coal-fired power \nplants is a key priority for lowering emissions and improving energy security. A high percentage \nof new coal-fired power-generating units are\u2014large from 300 megawatts (MW) up to 1 GW\u2014\nwith  supercritical  and  ultra-supercritical  (USC)  technologies  that  provide  much  higher \nefficiency.13 During 2006\u20132008, about 54 GW of old and inefficient coal-fired generators smaller \nthan 100 MW were closed, and the average efficiency of coal-fired power plants improved to \n340 grams of standard coal/kWh from 370 grams/kWh, avoiding 160 million t of coal usage \nduring this period. In general, the new USC plants have efficiencies on a par with or higher than \ninternational standards, but average plant efficiencies in the PRC are still much lower than \ninternational standards because of the country\u2019s many old and inefficient power plants. With \nmore supercritical and USC plants, average efficiency will gradually improve. It is still unlikely \nthat coal consumption or emissions will drop, as many new coal-fired power plants will continue \nto  come  online.  A  technology  change  is  therefore  essential  in  coal-fired  power  plants  to \ndecouple high coal usage from CO  emissions.      \n2\n \n10.  The  internationally  available  and more  advanced  clean coal  technologies14 such  as \nIGCC, which potentially offer even higher efficiency and far superior emission performances \nthan advanced supercritical and USC plants, are not currently installed in the PRC. IGCC \ntechnology turns coal into synthesis gas (syngas). It then removes impurities from the syngas \nbefore it is combusted. This reduces emissions of SO  and NO  by almost 99%. It also brings \n2 x\n4%\u20135% higher efficiency compared with supercritical plants.15 The higher costs of IGCC plants \nand perceived technology risks from complex design have been major barriers to its larger \nuptake.16 On their own, IGCC power plants offer only limited CO emission reductions from \n2 \nhigher efficiency. But the emergence of technology to separate, capture, transport, and store \nCO \u2014generally referred to as CO  capture and storage (CCS)\u2014has provided renewed impetus \n2 2\nfor the rapid adoption of IGCC technologies.17 Various international studies have found IGCC \npower plants with CCS to be the least-cost option to cut CO  emissions from coal-fired power \n2\n                                                 \n12 Estimated to be about 300 million t annually by the study conducted under technical assistance funded by the \nAsian Development Bank: ADB. 2004. Technical Assistance to the People's Republic of China for Waste Coal \nUtilization Study. Manila (TA 4389). \n13 The average efficiency of supercritical and USC plants is in the range of 40% or more compared to the average \nefficiency of below 30% from subcritical. A 1% efficiency improvement in the PRC's current generation of coal-fired \npower plants would avoid 13 million t of coal usage and 20 million t of CO  emissions per annum.   \n2\n14 Clean coal is an umbrella term widely used in the industry to describe technologies that reduce the environmental \nimpacts of coal-fired power plants. Historically, the aim was to reduce SO  and particulates, but, considering the \n2\nimpacts on global climate change from CO  emissions, clean coal technologies also refer to technologies that \n2\nreduce CO  emissions from coal-fired power plants.    \n2\n15 The Tianjin IGCC project's designed standard coal consumption rate is 274 grams per kWh of electricity produced, \nwhich is better than the average of 285 grams per kWh in USC plants.    \n16 The IGCC power plants costs about 80% higher than USC plants. The complexity in design is primarily due to the \ngasification of coal and cleaning of the syngas.   \n17 Most of the seven current IGCC plants (aggregate 1.5 GW) were built in the late 1990s and proved their efficiency \nand emissions benefits, but the uptake was slow thereafter until about 2007, when many IGCC plants (about 5.5 \nGW) were announced in Europe and the United States, especially in conjunction with CCS.  \n ", "4   \nplants by up to 90%.18 Appendix 2 provides more details on IGCC and CCS technologies.  \n \n11.  CCS  involves  capturing  CO   from  coal-fired  power  plants  either  before  combustion \n2\n(IGCC plants) or after combustion (supercritical or USC plants) and long-term storage in deep \ngeological formations such as depleted oil and gas wells. According to an IEA assessment, \nCCS presents the most promising GHG mitigation for coal-fired electricity generation.19 It is part \nof all climate change-mitigation strategies considered by IEA and the Intergovernmental Panel \non Climate Change (IPCC). To date, there is no industrial-scale coal-fired power plant with \nCCS. However, CCS has been used successfully in the oil and gas industry for many years. \nCCS is particularly relevant for a large coal-based economy like PRC to decouple its growing \nenergy needs from rising CO  emissions, a critical factor to lower the carbon intensity of the \n2\neconomy.20  \n \n2.  Opportunities  \n \n12.  To recognize the central role of coal in long-term energy security, and to ensure the \nenvironmental sustainability of rapidly increasing coal-fired generation capacity, the Government \nannounced the GreenGen program in October 2005. Greengen Company Ltd (Greengen) was \nlaunched  in  December  2005  with  a  mandate  to  lead  the  research,  development,  and \ndemonstration (RD&D) of IGCC and CCS technologies, leading to a near-zero emission coal-\nfired power plant by 2015 under the GreenGen program. China Huaneng Group (CHNG), the \nlargest electricity-generating company in the PRC, is the managing company of Greengen, with \n51% of shares.21 Greengen has drawn up a three-phase RD&D program. The first phase (2008\u2013\n2011) aims to implement the 250 MW Tianjin IGCC plant (the Project).22 The second phase \n(2011\u20132013) is expected to implement a scaled-up IGCC plant of 400 MW and more with pilot \ntesting of CCS. The third phase (2015 onwards) will implement fully integrated IGCC and CCS \nwith a near-zero emission coal-fired power plant. The Project is supported by the Ministry of \nScience  and  Technology  (MOST)  and  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission \n(NDRC). It is listed as one of the major projects for scientific development in the 11th FYP under \nthe National High-Tech RD&D Program. Tianjin is selected as the location in consideration of \nfuture CCS application and its proximity (45 kilometers) to the Dagang oil field, which is owned \nby  China  National  Petroleum  Corporation.23 Appendix  2  includes  more  information  on  the \nGreenGen program.  \n \n13.  CHNG is a wholly state-owned enterprise (SOE) that has been at the forefront of clean \ncoal technologies and led supercritical and USC development and deployment in the PRC. It \ndoubled its installed capacity of 43 GW in 2005 to 86 GW in 2008 and contributes 10% to \nnational electricity production, generating 364.5 TWh in 2008. CHNG has, as the managing \ncompany  of  Greengen,  identified  the  project  location  as  its  IGCC  base.  It  is  expected  to \nconsider installing more than 1 GW of IGCC capacity by 2015. CHNG also implemented a 3,000 \nt/year pilot project of CO  capture and industrial utilization in 2008 at its Gao Bei Dian plant, a \n2\n                                                 \n18 The studies were conducted by the National Energy Technology Laboratory in the United States in 2007 and IEA in \n2008.  \n19 CCS is particularly suited to capturing CO  from large point sources (those with more than 100,000 t of CO  \n2 2\nemissions/year). A 300 MW coal-fired power plant typically emits more than 1 million t of CO  every year.  \n2\n20 The carbon intensity is the amount of CO2 emitted per $1,000 of GDP. \n21 The other shareholders are four other main generators (China Datang Group, China Huadian Corporation, China \nGuodian Corporation, and China Power Investment Company), two large coal-mining companies (Shenhua Group \nand China Coal Group), and the State Development and Investment Company. \n22 The Government is considering implementing three other IGCC plants\u2014250 MW at Zhejiang and 400 MW each at \nLangfang and Yantai\u2014to demonstrate a critical mass of IGCC projects with different gasifier technologies and plant \nsize.  \n23 It is expected that the first CCS application will be for enhanced oil recovery possibly from Dagang oil field.  ", "  5\nsupercritical coal-fired plant near Beijing. It is currently implementing a scaled-up 100,000 t/year \nCO  capture and industrial utilization project near Shanghai at another supercritical plant. The \n2\nimplementation  of  these  CO   capture  projects  at  coal-fired  power  plants  signifies  CHNG's \n2\nstrategic intent to lead CCS technology development in the PRC. While CCS is not included in \nthe Project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is helping the Government and Greengen to \nidentify the key issues and barriers and prepare a road map for CCS demonstration through a \ncomplementary technical assistance (TA) grant.24 \n \n14.  The  successful  completion  of  the  Project  will  demonstrate  the  viability  of  IGCC \ntechnology and identify a clear pathway for multiple demonstration projects and its future full-\nscale  deployment.  The  timely  and  successful  completion  of  phase  one  of  the  GreenGen \nprogram is critical to triggering the ensuing phases of near-zero emission coal-fired power plant \ndevelopment by 2015, which has the potential to greatly cut GHG emissions from coal-fired \npower plants and play a crucial role in lowering the carbon intensity of the electricity generation.   \n \n3.  Strategies of the Government  \n \n15.  The Government has implemented significant reforms in the energy sector. National \nenergy enterprises have autonomy for investment decisions, and coal prices are gradually being \nderegulated. The power subsector was unbundled in 2003 with the creation of five national and \nseveral  jointly  owned  provincial  power-generation  companies,  along  with  two  power-\ntransmission  and  distribution  companies  that  have  provincial  subsidiaries  for  satisfying \nconsumer demand. However, transmission and distribution functions are still bundled together. \nUnbundling these functions is being carefully considered. The independent State Electricity \nRegulatory Commission is now present in all provinces. Recognizing the importance of energy \nto the national economy, the National Energy Administration was set up within NDRC in 2008 \nand is now functional. NDRC regulates the retail electricity tariff. The adoption and approval of \nnew  technology  and  demonstration  plants  are  carefully  considered  before  approval  of \ninvestment decisions. The approach is to encourage competition and send a strong signal \nregarding efficiency even at the demonstration stage. This approach, combined with the largest \nmarket for new and innovative technologies, proved successful in bringing down costs, thus \nfacilitating quick deployment, as demonstrated in the large addition of new wind power projects \nin the past 3 years. Tariff-setting principles are based on cost recovery with adequate returns \nand have been consistently applied for more than a decade. Higher tariffs for new technology \nprojects have been consistently approved. Appendix 3 provides more details on the sector.  \n \n16.  The Government recognizes the environmental challenges and climate change impacts \nof its growing energy use and prioritized energy efficiency and environmental protection in the \n11th FYP. The plan includes obligatory targets to improve energy intensity by 20% and reduce \nby 10% major pollutants, including SO , which is emitted mostly by coal-fired power plants. \n2\nSince the announcement of the targets, the State Council has issued a number of guidelines \nand plans to intensify efforts to improve energy efficiency and reduce pollution. The recently \namended Energy Conservation Law became effective on 1 April 2008. Power generation plays \na  significant  role  in  energy  efficiency  improvement  and  has  shown  consistent  progress  in \nimproving the efficiency of coal-fired power plants and lowering emissions. The Government \nannounced  in  2008  its  Climate  Change  Action  Plan,  which  recognizes  the  importance  of \nscientific research and supports developing advanced technologies such as IGCC and CCS. In \n                                                 \n24 ADB. 2009.

Manila (TA 7286-PRC, approved on 22 May, for \n$1,250,000). \n ", "6   \nNovember 2009, the Government announced the plan to reduce carbon intensity of its GDP by \n40%\u201345% compared with 2005 level.    \n \n4.  Strategies of the Asian Development Bank \n \n17.  ADB  energy  sector  strategies  are  fully  aligned  with  the  Government\u2019s  11th  FYP \nstrategies and plans. ADB supports the Government\u2019s sector strategies to move towards a low-\ncarbon path through (i) energy efficiency and conservation, (ii) renewable energy development, \n(iii) urban environment improvement through more efficient energy production and distribution, \n(iv) clean coal technology development, (v) coal mine and coal bed methane development, and \n(vi) regional cooperation to strengthen energy security. Clean coal development has been a \npriority area for ADB operations in the PRC. ADB provided grant-financed TA25 in 1997 to \nassess the appropriateness of IGCC technologies and prepare the conceptual design of an \nIGCC demonstration plan.26 The TA was implemented in close cooperation with the Thermal \nPower Research Institute (TPRI) in Xian, the leading research organization in thermal power \nengineering in the PRC.27 Since late 2007, ADB has worked closely with CHNG and Greengen \nand provided a small-scale TA in 2008 to support project development.28 Recognizing the key \nrole of IGCC and CCS technologies in climate change mitigation, ADB has formed partnerships \nwith leading knowledge bodies\u2014the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum and the Global \nCCS Institute in Australia\u2014in this emerging area directly relevant to its developing member \ncountries. These partnerships have provided access to expert networks and created dedicated \nresources to help accelerate CCS demonstration.29  \n \n18.  ADB\u2019s Clean Energy and Environment Program includes innovative instruments such as \nthe multidonor-funded, $150 million Asia Pacific Carbon Fund, Future Carbon Fund, and CCF. \nAll these funds are directly relevant to the Project\u2019s need for low-cost, long-term financing \naiming to demonstrate an innovative technology. By successfully demonstrating the advantages \nof IGCC technology the Project will reinforce confidence in the viability of this technology and \nencourage policy makers to approve more IGCC projects. Multiple demonstration projects with \ninternational support will shorten the learning curve and help achieve economies of scale. ADB \nproject support will provide additional technical due diligence and help mitigate risks, strengthen \ncompliance with safeguards, and thereby establish appropriate benchmarks and standards for \nfuture IGCC projects.    \n \n5.  Lessons  \n \n19.  ADB's experience in the PRC energy sector is that projects are generally well planned \nand  smoothly  implemented.  The  implementation  performance  of  ADB's  energy  portfolio  is \nsatisfactory. The country assistance program evaluation in 2007 recorded that the performance \nof more than 83% of energy projects was either satisfactory or highly satisfactory. It warned \nabout  possible  start-up  delays  as  sector  operations  move  towards  more  innovative  and \nchallenging areas of energy efficiency, renewables, and advanced technology. Like projects in \nother sectors, some energy projects experienced such delays, mainly because of (i) multiple \n                                                 \n25 ADB. 1997.

", "  7\nproject components that require elaborate onlending formalities and approvals in the PRC; (ii) \ndelayed feasibility report approval, which signifies the formal investment decision; and (iii) weak \ncapacity in the executing agency (EA) and implementing agency (IA), especially those not fully \nfamiliar with ADB policies, procedures, and requirements. To minimize or eliminate start-up \ndelays, relevant lessons identified in previous projects were fully incorporated into the design of \nthe Project. All relevant national approvals are in place, including the feasibility report. In terms \nof capacity, the project executing and implementing agencies are among the strongest in the \ncountry and internationally. Some key risk areas were further addressed through small-scale TA \n(para.  17,  footnote  28).  Appendix  4  provides  more  information  on  ADB  experiences  and \nlessons. \n \n20.  As this is the first IGCC project in the PRC, particular attention has been paid to some \nspecific technical and management challenges. To fully incorporate lessons from similar plants \nin Europe, proper technical due diligence was carried out by international experts and their \nsuggestions were incorporated in the project design. It has also been ensured that future \nsupport will be available from international experts during the construction and initial operation \nphase. A formal cooperation agreement was signed between Huaneng Tianjin IGCC Co., Ltd. \n(HTICL) and the owner of the Puertollano IGCC Plant in Spain.   \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED PROJECT \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n21.  The impact of the Project will be reduced GHG emissions from coal-fired power plants. \nThe outcome will be the IGCC plants demonstrating climate change mitigation effect of new \ntechnology deployed. \n \nB.  Outputs \n \n22.  The project outputs include (i) constructing and operating an IGCC power plant of 250 \nMW capacity in Binhai New Area, Tianjin city for generating 1,470 gigawatt-hours of electricity \nannually, which will be sold to the Northern China Grid Company Limited through a 220 kilovolt \ninterconnecting  transmission  line;  (ii)  adequate  capacity  in  project  management,  safeguard \ncompliance,  and  plant  operation  and  maintenance  (O&M);  and  (iii)  capacity  developed  for \nobtaining carbon offset revenues from IGCC plants. \n \nC.  Special Features \n \n1.  Demonstration of an Innovative and Advanced Clean Coal Technology  \n \n23.  The  Project  will  introduce  IGCC  technology,  the  most  efficient  and  least  polluting \nadvanced clean coal technology currently available commercially (para. 10, footnotes 15) for the \nfirst time in PRC. Technologically, the Project represents a significant change from conventional \ncoal-fired power plants as it involves the gasification of the coal before combustion. As a \ncollaborative project of all major energy enterprises in the PRC (para. 12 and footnote 21), the \nProject offers a natural knowledge platform and will disseminate experiences and results to all \nmajor energy enterprises in the PRC. The Project is a cornerstone of the critical first of the three \nphases in the GreenGen program (para. 12) that is expected to lead to a near-zero emission \ncoal-fired power plant by 2015. Project implementation will provide valuable insights into the \nchallenges, issues, and benefits of IGCC technologies that will guide the ensuing phases. By \nsuccessfully applying IGCC technology in an industrial-size coal-fired power plant, the Project \nwill  bolster  the  confidence  of  investors,  project  developers,  and  policy  makers  in  IGCC \n ", "8   \ntechnology and pave the way for multiple demonstration projects. As more IGCC plants are \nimplemented and designers get more confident in dealing with the technology, larger IGCC \nplants in the range of 400 MW and higher will be implemented, which will reduce costs per MW \nand narrow the current incremental cost gap of 80% compared with USC plants to 20%. The \nPRC is potentially the largest market for IGCC, whose wider deployment will encourage cost-\ncompetitive local manufacturing of key components, which will further reduce the cost and bring \nrapid deployment.  \n \n2.  Innovative Risk Mitigation Measures \n \n24.  Project implementation carries risks inherent in any project demonstrating an advanced \nand innovative technology for the first time in a country. A unique approach was adopted to \nsubstantially reduce risk without increasing project cost, which is already a major barrier to \npromoting IGCC technology. Lessons on improving the sustainability and performance of similar \nIGCC power plants in Europe and elsewhere were incorporated into project design by utilizing \npart of the $5 million grant from ADB's CCF.30 The initial O&M period of about 2 years for an \nIGCC  demonstration  plant  is  critical  to  ensuring  its  sustainability,  especially  for  its  key \ncomponents\u2014the coal gasifier and gas turbines. The suppliers' direct supervision and support \nduring  this  critical  phase,  financed  through  the  grant,  will  (i)  provide  enhanced  technical \nexpertise at a short notice; (ii) help quickly diagnose problems; and (iii) strengthen the quality of \nO&M, which will help the Project quickly stabilize at its designed performance level. Supplier-\nassisted O&M will provide on-the-job training to HTICL staff, thereby developing their capacity \nand  enhancing  the  sustainability  of  the  Project.  The  grant  will  also  be  used  to  engage \ninternational and national consultants for a total of 16 person-months to support the compliance \nwith the safeguards, and in project management, monitoring and reporting. This will establish \nappropriate benchmarks and standards for future IGCC projects. Additionally, to avoid any \nfinancial distress to HTICL during the initial operation period, a grace period of 6 years for the \nADB loan is included.  \n \n3.  Potential Benefits from Clean Development Mechanism \n \n25.  The Project is anticipated to be eligible for certified emission reductions (CERs) under \nthe  Clean  Development  Mechanism  (CDM). 31  By  applying  the  approved  Consolidated \nMethodology, 32  emission  reductions  will  be  achieved  through  higher  efficiency,  thereby \nreplacing coal usage in pulverized coal-fired power generation. Based on this methodology, four \nhigh-efficiency pulverized coal-fired power plants in the PRC have been designed and are being \nprepared for the CDM validation stage. The Project will construct the first IGCC power plant in \nthe PRC that would be eligible under the modalities and procedures of CDM. ADB's Technical \nSupport Facility under its Carbon Market Initiative (CMI) is helping Greengen to develop the \nCDM project design document based on the approved methodology to support its registration \nwith the CDM Executive Board. As IGCC technology is considered to have high potential for \nreducing GHGs, the Technical Support Facility\u2019s additional support for devices and processes to \nmonitor and validate GHG reduction is being considered to provide enhanced support for this \n                                                 \n30 A similar grant of $800,000 from the Clean Energy Financing Partnership Facility was approved in 2008 for an \ninnovative multitranche financing facility for Guangdong: ADB. 2008.

In addition to this, the project would also \ncontribute greatly in reducing emissions of both greenhouse gases and local pollutants like SOx \nand NOx. HTICL has shown interest in considering the CMI\u2019s Asia Pacific Carbon Fund or \nFuture Carbon Fund to contract CERs, which may frontload up to 50% of the aggregated CERs \nup to 2020. The quantification of CDM benefits at the current market price tends to grossly \nunderstate the global benefits from GHG emission reduction.33  \n \nD.  Project Investment Plan \n26.

Financing Plan \n \n28.  The Government has requested financing of up to an equivalent of $135.0 million (32% \nof project cost) from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital resources to finance the purchase of goods, works, \nand consulting services, including taxes and duties estimated to be $19.5 million on the ADB-\nfinanced  portion  of  project  costs.  The  remaining  cost  will  be  financed  through  equity \ncontributions of $84.0 million equivalent (20% of project cost) and a domestic loan of $195.59 \nmillion  equivalent  (47%  of  project  cost)  from  a  group  of  local  banks  led  by  the  China \nConstruction Bank. ADB's Climate Change Fund will provide a grant cofinancing equivalent to \n$5.0 million (1% of project cost) to finance some components of the Project (para. 24).

The ADB loan will have a 26-year term, including a grace period of 6 years, an interest \nrate determined in accordance with ADB\u2019s London interbank offered rate (LIBOR)-based lending \nfacility, a commitment charge of 0.15% per annum, and such other terms and conditions set \nforth in the draft loan and project agreements. The Government has provided ADB with the \nreasons for its decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s LIBOR-based lending facility based on these \nterms and conditions, and an undertaking that these choices were its own independent decision \nand not made in reliance on any communication or advice from ADB. \n \nF.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n1.  Onlending Arrangements  \n \n30.  The Borrower of the ADB loan will be the PRC, and loan proceeds will be relent by the \nBorrower through the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to the Export and Import Bank of China (EXIM \nBank) on the same terms and conditions as the loan between ADB and the PRC. EXIM Bank \nwill, in turn, onlend these loan proceeds to CHNG on similar loan terms as the EXIM Bank loan \nand include an administration fee of 0.15% for providing onlending services to MOF. CHNG, \nthrough an onlending agreement, will then onlend the loan proceeds to Greengen, who will then \nthrough a separate onlending agreement lend the proceeds to HTICL as the IA under a fourth \nonlending agreement, which again will incorporate the same terms and conditions as their \nagreement with EXIM Bank. HTICL shall bear the risk of currency and interest rate fluctuation. \nThough HTICL is a separate legal entity, it will continue to have close management links with \nGreengen, which will provide management oversight to HTICL. Information about EXIM Bank is \nin Appendix 6.   \n \n31.  The role of EXIM Bank in the Project is crucial to facilitate onlending from MOF to \nCHNG, an SOE. EXIM Bank is a policy bank of the Government under the direct administration ", "  11\nof the State Council. It has the same credit rating as the Government of the PRC. Onlending \nloans and grants to SOEs from international financial institutions is one of its main roles. It has \nplayed a similar role in World Bank and European Investment Bank loans but not yet for ADB \nloans.34 This onlending modality through EXIM Bank will test an innovative new approach for \nfuture ADB lending support to similar advanced technology projects in areas of clean energy \nand  climate  change  mitigation  that  will  be  implemented  by  SOEs.  The  fund  flow  of  loan \nproceeds is consistent with the project organization chart included in Appendix 7.    \n \n2.  Project Management \n \n32.  CHNG will be the EA. It is the managing partner of Greengen, which was established in \n2005 with an authorized share capital of CNY300 million. Greengen established HTICL with the \nmandate to develop the Project and to be the IA. HTICL was registered as a limited liability \ncompany under PRC law in November 2008. Greengen will provide management support and \noversight  to  HTICL,  supporting  Project  implementation,  particularly  in  relation  to  financial \nmanagement, financial control, and accounting, and ensuring good governance of the Project. \nGreengen is also responsible for liaising with CHNG. Establishing HTICL as a separate project \nentity  is  considered  prudent  as  it  (i)  brings  transparency,  (ii)  improves  accountability  and \ncorporate governance, and (iii) ensures a task force approach to project development that \nensures a strong management focus. A project director reporting directly to the president of \nGreengen will be responsible for project management, contract approval, and payments. A \nproject  implementation  unit  (PIU)  established  in  HTICL  will  regularly  monitor  and  review \nimplementation progress. HTICL has already established an environmental management unit \n(EMU)  to  coordinate  implementation  of  the  environmental  management  plan  (EMP)  with \ncontractors and the Tianjin environment protection bureau. The EMU will oversee environmental \nmanagement and monitoring during construction and operation, including the environmental \nsupervision  of  contractors.  The  PIU  will  be  headed  by  a  project  manager  responsible  for \nphysical  implementation  day  to  day  and  the  preparation  of  progress  reports.  A  team  of \ninternational and national consultants will assist the PIU to comply with safeguards, and for \nproject monitoring, review, and reporting. An organization chart for implementing the Project is \nin Appendix 7.  \n \n3.  Implementation Period \n \n33.  The  Project  will  be  implemented  over  3  years  from  2009  to  2012.  The  Project's \npreconstruction activities, such as detailed design, preparing bidding documents, tendering, and \nawarding contracts, began in mid-2008. On-site preconstruction started in July 2009. Main civil \nworks will start in February 2010 and take about 20 months. The construction of the Project and \nthe expected completion date for the loan is June 2012, however the grant will be implemented \nover a longer period until June 2015 as it involves service contracts during implementation. The \nimplementation schedule is in Appendix 8. \n \n4.  Procurement \n \n34.  All ADB-financed procurement for the Project will be carried out in accordance with \nADB's Procurement Guidelines (2007, as amended from time to time). Civil works and goods \nunder the Project will be properly packaged in accordance with the Procurement Guidelines. \nCivil works contracts costing more than $10 million and goods supply contracts costing more \nthan $1 million financed by ADB will be procured through international competitive bidding \n                                                 \n34 The World Bank loan is for an energy efficiency project, for which EXIM Bank onlends the loan proceeds to energy \nefficiency enterprises in the PRC.    \n ", "12   \nprocedures using ADB\u2019s standard bidding documents. Civil works contracts costing less than \n$10  million  but  more  than  $500,000  will  be  procured  through  national  competitive  bidding \n(NCB). Goods supply contract packages costing more than $500,000 up to $1,000,000 will be \nprocured using either NCB or, in exceptional circumstances and with the prior approval of ADB, \nlimited international bidding procedures. Goods supply contract packages costing less than \n$500,000  will  be  procured  using  shopping  procedures.  A  general  procurement  notice  was \nposted on ADB's website on 26 March 2008. An initial procurement plan was prepared and \napproved in August 2008 during project concept clearance. The procurement plan was updated \nand revised in view of refined cost estimates and timing. The revised procurement plan agreed \nwith the government, Greengen, and HTICL is in Appendix 9.35 The procurement capacity \nassessment report and recommendations for the Project are in Supplementary Appendix A.  \n \n5.  Consulting Services \n \n35.  The loan will not finance consulting services. International and national consultants to be \nfinanced from the grant component (para. 24) of the Project will be recruited in accordance with \nADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Since the \nrequired services are in a very specialized area with little consulting input, three individual \nconsultants will be recruited. Consulting services for the Project are estimated at 4 person-\nmonths of international and 12 person-months of national. Consultants\u2019 terms of reference are in \nSupplementary Appendix B.  \n \n6.  Anticorruption Policy  \n \n36.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained and discussed \nwith the Government, CHNG, Greengen, and HTICL. Consistent with its commitment to good \ngovernance, accountability, and transparency, ADB reserves the right to investigate, directly or \nthrough its agents, any alleged corrupt, fraudulent, collusive, or coercive practices relating to the \nProject. To support these efforts, relevant provisions of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy are included \nin  the  loan  regulations,  grant  regulations,  and  the  bidding  documents  for  the  Project.  In \nparticular, all contracts financed by ADB in connection with the Project shall include provisions \nspecifying the right of ADB to audit and examine the records and accounts of HTICL and all \ncontractors, suppliers, consultants, and other service providers as they relate to the Project. \nAdditional  governance  and  anticorruption  provisions  in  relation  to  the  disclosure  of  non-\ncommercial  project  information  and  procurement,  project  performance  review,  and  dispute \nreview are included as specific assurances, which will be negotiated and included in the legal \ndocuments. \n \n7.  Disbursement Arrangements \n \n37.  The  loan  and  grant  proceeds  will  be  disbursed  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Loan \nDisbursement Handbook (2007, as amended from time to time) and other details as agreed \nupon in the grant and project agreements. To facilitate project implementation and fund flow, \ntwo imprest accounts for loan and grant funds, respectively, will be set up in a bank acceptable \nto ADB. The imprest accounts shall be managed by HTICL under the supervision of Greengen \nand used exclusively to finance ADB's share of eligible expenditures for the loan and grant as \nspecified in the loan and grant agreements.36 The initial advances to be deposited to the loan \nand grant imprest accounts will not exceed either 6 months of estimated expenditures to be \n                                                 \n35 A $5 million grant from CCF (para. 24) will be utilized for financing some of the procurement packages. A grant \nutilization plan is in Appendix 10. \n36 Bank charges on the imprest accounts may be financed from loan and grant resources.  ", "  13\nfinanced from the imprest account or 10% of the loan or grant amount, whichever is lower. To \nsimplify documentation, the statement of expenditure procedure will be used for reimbursement \nof eligible expenses and replenishment and liquidation of eligible expenditures financed from the \nimprest accounts for any individual payment not exceeding $200,000. Payments in excess of \nthe ceiling for statement of expenditure will be substantiated by full supporting documentation. \nDirect payment procedures will apply for large contracts under the Project. The reimbursement \nprocedure will be used for loan expenditures incurred under retroactive financing, where CHNG, \nGreengen, or HTICL will initially fund the eligible expenditures from its own resources.  \n \n8.  Advanced Contracting and Retroactive Financing  \n \n38.  Initial procurement, mainly under the counterpart funding component, started in mid-\n2008 (para. 33) with the preparation of bid documents, tendering, and bid evaluation. In view of \nthe advanced stage of project preparation, the Government requested ADB approval of advance \ncontracting for civil works and goods. ADB management approved this in August 2008.  \n \n39.  The Government has requested retroactive financing of up to 20% of the loan amount for \nthe Project for expenditures are incurred in accordance with ADB\u2019s Procurement Guidelines or \nGuidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants  during  the  12  months  before  the  signing  of  the \ncorresponding  loan  agreement  and  loan  effectiveness.  Retroactive  financing  is  sought  for \neligible expenditures, including civil works, goods, and consulting services that are critically \nrequired at the start and in the initial stages of construction. The Government has been informed \nthat approval of advanced contracting and retroactive financing does not commit ADB to finance \nthe Project.  \n \n9.  Accounting, Auditing, and Reporting \n \n40.  The accounting, internal control, and reporting systems and procedures of HTICL will \nfollow the accounting principles and practices prescribed by the Accounting Law of the PRC, \nwhich requires enterprises to prepare financial statements and generally follow international \naccounting standards. HTICL will maintain separate accounts for its operations and submit to \nADB audited project accounts and agency financial statements, including a management letter, \nin English not later than 6 months after the end of each financial year. The audit report will \ninclude a statement verifying whether the funds disbursed by ADB were used for the purposes \nfor which they were provided, as well as the separate auditor's opinion on the use of the imprest \naccount and statement of expenditure procedures. The submitted project accounts and agency \nfinancial statements should be of acceptable quality and subject to an independent audit by the \nprovincial or municipal audit bureau or an external auditor acceptable to ADB. The Government, \nCHNG, Greengen, and HTICL have been informed of ADB\u2019s policy on the submission of audited \nfinancial statements and possible penalties for delays in submission.  \n \n41.  Greengen and HTICL will submit to ADB reports and information concerning the use of \nloan  proceeds,  project  implementation,  imprest  accounts,  and  the  performance  of  the \nconsultants. The reports will include (i) quarterly progress reports on project implementation, \nincluding brief monthly updates; and (ii) a completion report for the Project not later than 3 \nmonths after project completion. In addition, Greengen and HTICL will provide ADB with reports \non  contract  management  procedures,  including  approval  of  variation  orders  and  progress \npayment certificates. \n \n \n \n \n ", "14   \n10.  Project Performance Monitoring and Evaluation \n \n42.  A project performance and monitoring system, including indicators and their relevance, \nwas discussed with Greengen and HTICL during project preparation. The indicators are based \non the performance indicators in the design and monitoring framework. Macroeconomic and \nsector performance, institutional capacity, and ongoing reforms were taken into account in the \ndesign of monitoring indicators, which include environmental and socioeconomic indicators. \nDuring  implementation,  implementation-supervision  consultants  and  EMU  will  help  HTICL \nmonitor  project  impact  and  keep  ADB  informed  of  implementation  progress  with  the  EMP \nthrough biannual progress reports. An environmental compliance report submitted in July 2009 \nindicated that project implementation was progressing well and in compliance with the EMP.   \n \n11.  Project Review \n43.  ADB will field regular missions at least once a year to assess project implementation and \ncompliance with the provisions of the loan, grant, and project agreements. An inception mission \nwill be fielded within 3 months of project approval. In 2011, ADB, CHNG, Greengen, and HTICL \nwill  carry  out  a  midterm  review  of  the  Project,  covering  all  institutional,  administrative, \norganizational, technical, environmental, economic, financial, and other relevant aspects that \nmay affect the performance of the Project and its continuing viability. The midterm review will \nexamine progress on relevant sector reforms and evaluate compliance with assurances in the \nlegal agreements. HTICL will prepare a project completion report promptly after the physical \ncompletion of the Project but not later than 6 months thereafter. \n \nIV.  GRANT FROM THE CLIMATE CHANGE FUND  \n \n44.  Because the Project demonstrates key energy efficiency technology with strong potential \nfor climate change mitigation, grant assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $5 million from \nthe CCF is proposed. The grant will be utilized for (i) long-term maintenance contracts with the \nsuppliers of the coal gasifier and gas turbines, (ii) the civil works contract cost for the air \nseparation unit of the chemical island, and (iii) recruiting international and national consultants \nto supervise project implementation. The grant assistance will significantly reduce risks (para. \n24)  and  strengthen  project  management  capacity  and  reporting  on  compliance  with  key \nsafeguards. The grant passes through the Borrower to HTICL through CHNG and Greengen. \nThe grant utilization plan is in Appendix 10.  \n \nV.  PROJECT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS \n \nA.  Financial Analysis  \n \n45.  The Project's financial viability is based on an electricity tariff of CNY0.56/kWh, as \nproposed in the feasibility report, which is substantially higher than the prevalent CNY0.38/kWh \nelectricity tariff from conventional coal-fired power plants in Tianjin. This higher tariff reflects \nhigher capital and O&M costs for the first IGCC power plant in the PRC. While the actual tariff \nwill be formally set only after construction is completed, it is anticipated to be about the same as \nthe feasibility report tariff.  \n \n46.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) and financial net present value (FNPV) were \ncalculated for the Project. Potential carbon offset revenues were not included in the base case \ncalculation. The FIRR is 6.4%, which is higher than the weighted average cost of capital \n(WACC), estimated at 3.7%. The FNPV is CNY820.9 million at this WACC. The Project is \nconsidered financially viable. Sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRR is robust under various ", "  15\nadverse conditions. The sensitivity analysis showed that the FIRR of the Project would decrease \nto (i) 6.0% if the Project experienced a cost overrun of 10%, (ii) 4.4% if project benefits were \nreduced by 10%, (iii) 5.5% if project O&M expenses increase by 10%, and (iv) 5.7% if project \ncompletion is delayed by 1 year. Inclusion of estimated carbon offset revenues up to 2020 \nwould, at a conservative estimate, improve the FIRR to 7.2% and the FNPV to CNY1,045.3 \nmillion and would further strengthen the Project's financial viability and improve its cash flow. \nThe financial analysis of the Project is in Appendix 11. \n \nB.  Financial Performance of Greengen and CHNG  \n \n47.  Analysis of financial performance was done only for CHNG. Greengen and HTICL are \nnew companies with little historical data. An analysis of CHNG\u2019s financial statements for the \npast 4 years was done following ADB's Financial Management and Analysis of Projects.37 The \naudited financial statements of CHNG show that the company\u2019s financial condition has been \nfairly sound except in 2008, when the global financial crisis significantly affected its operations. \nThat was a difficult year for CHNG, mainly due to low demand and lower regulated tariffs, which \nsubsequently increased in early 2009. Unlike the consistently good financial performance in all \nprevious years, the company sustained a net loss of CNY6.78 billion (4.5% of sales) in 2008.38 \nIts financial performance will continue to be closely monitored during project implementation. \nMore data and information on financial management assessment and financial performance and \nprojections of project enterprises are in Appendix 12.  \n \n48.  The review of CHNG and HTICL financial management capacity and practices indicates \nthat the current systems, policies and standards, and training programs on general accounting \nand finance meet good national and international standards. CHNG's capital structure is robust, \nwith shareholders' equity comprising over 40% of its capital structure. However, it is noted that \nthe company has embarked on a very large capacity expansion, which doubled its installed \ncapacity in the 3 years after 2005. This expansion, combined with the large investment needed \nto meet environmental regulations and the requirements of energy efficiency and conservation \nin coal-fired power plants, eroded its capital structure and reduced the equity position to about \n33%  in  2005  and  28%  in  2008.  CHNG  is  expected  to  reassess  its  capital  structure  in \nconsultation with the Government and seek more equity injection.  \n \n49.  Historical and projected financial statements, as well as the key financial indicators, are \nin Supplementary Appendix C.  \n \nC.  Economic Analysis  \n \n50.  The  electricity  demand  forecast  for  Tianjin  considered  trends,  structural  changes, \nefficiency improvements, GDP growth, and other planned economic developments affecting \ndemand. Electricity demand was conservatively estimated to grow at 8% in 2011\u20132015 and 6% \nin 2015\u20132025. The estimates suggest that there will be continued strong demand for electricity \nin Tianjin, and the Project will provide incremental electricity to meet part of it.  \n \n51.  The economic internal rate of return (EIRR) for the Project was calculated to assess its \neconomic  viability.  Capital  costs  and  O&M  costs  were  considered.  Appropriate  conversion \nfactors were used to convert financial values into economic values. Values are expressed in \n2009 local currency. The quantified benefits of the Project considered in the economic analysis \nincluded incremental energy supply through willingness to pay. This yielded an EIRR of 16.49%. \n                                                 \n37 ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n38 All five major electricity generators in the PRC showed significant losses in 2008.  \n ", "16   \nThe EIRR is conservatively calculated, as it takes into account only the main benefits and \nincludes all project-related costs. Sensitivity and risk analyses simulating adverse scenarios \nwere carried out, and the EIRR was found to be stable and robust. Appendix 13 presents the \neconomic analysis of the Project. \n \nD.  Environmental Benefits and Impacts  \n \n52.  The  Project  is  classified  as  environment  category  A  in  accordance  with  ADB's \nenvironmental  classification  criteria  under  its  Environment  Policy  (2002).  The  project \nenvironmental  impact  assessment  (EIA),  prepared  by  the  Tianjin  Environment  Protection \nResearch Institute, was approved by the State Environmental Protection Administration (now \nthe Ministry of Environment Protection) in July 2007 and uploaded to the ADB website on 14 \nApril 2008. A summary of environmental impacts and the implementation of the EMP is in \nAppendix 14. The full EIA report is in Supplementary Appendix D.  \n \n53.  Coal-fired IGCC power plants substantially reduce emissions of major air pollutants like \nSO , NO , total suspended particulates, and CO  when compared with conventional power \n2 x 2\nplants. In comparison to a conventional coal-fired power plant of 300 MW capacity, the avoided \nannual emissions from the IGCC plant are estimated at 43 t of total suspended particulate, \n1,237 t of SO , and 3,325 t of NO . On completion, the Project will save 134,000 t of coal per \n2 x\nyear of operation. It will prevent an estimated 372,000 t of CO  emissions annually and result in, \n2\nassociated  global  climate  benefits.  The  Project  will  use  35%  less  cooling  water  than  an \nalternative conventional plant and generate significantly less slag.  \n \n54.  The IGCC plant is proposed to be located in an industrial area on land reclaimed from \nthe  Bohai  Sea.  The  environmental  value  of  the  land  and  its  surroundings  is  poor.  The \nenvironmental impacts of the Project, mainly limited to construction, are dust emissions, soil \nerosion, accidental spillage, noise impacts, and waste generation. The summary EIA reported \nthat the adverse environmental impacts of the Project can be minimized to acceptable levels by \nimplementing adequately funded environmental management activities. Project cost estimates \ninclude CNY88.25 million for environmental protection. The project monitoring plan and counter \nsupervision of all construction by CHNG and its contracted environmental representative is \ndesigned  to  ensure  compliance  with  ADB  policies  and  procedures  and  government \nenvironmental legislation, policies, and guidelines. The first annual environmental compliance \nreport  was  submitted  in  July  2009.  As  project  construction  was  in  a  preliminary  stage, \nenvironment impacts were minimal and complied with the agreed EMP. To further strengthen \ncompliance, ADB will closely monitor construction through regular missions.  \n \nE.  Social Impacts  \n \n55.  The Project has acquired 20 hectares of newly reclaimed land in an existing industrial \npark and therefore does not entail any resettlement. Based on ADB's safeguard policies, it is \ncategory C in terms of involuntary resettlement and indigenous people impacts. The Project will \nprovide indirect social benefits through improved air quality in the project area. During project \nconstruction,  the  peak  number  of  workers  may  reach  1,000.  The  influx  of  workers  during \nconstruction may increase the incidence of disease, particularly epidemic diseases. Mitigation \nmeasures  will  include  providing  health  education  for  workers  and  hygienic  worker \naccommodation. A summary poverty reduction and social strategy report is in Appendix 15.   \n \n \n \n ", "  17\nF.  Project Risks and Mitigation Measures   \n \n56.  All  the  major  components  of  the  IGCC  power  plant  have  been  pilot  tested  or \ncommercially  established  and  are  in  successful  operation  in  the  PRC.  However,  these \ncomponents  have  not  yet  been  combined  in  a  reliable,  industrial-size  IGCC  power  plant. \nTherefore, the risks involved in this project being a first-of-a-kind risk demonstration project, \nexists, especially during the first 2 years of operation. The risk has been substantially reduced \nwith the help of a $5 million grant from ADB's CCF.  \n \n57.  The coal gasifier is a significant departure from a conventional coal-fired power plant. \nCoal gasification is a mature technology, and about 15 similar coal gasifiers as proposed for the \nProject (2,000 t/day) are extensively used in various chemical industry plants in the PRC. At \nleast two gasifiers of the same capacity are installed in the Tianjin Harbor Industrial Park next to \nthe Project site, in the Tianjin Alkali Plant. The Project will use a domestically developed coal \ngasifier with a capacity of 36 t/day using coal of the same quality, a prototype of which was \ndesigned and constructed by TPRI in 2006. This prototype gasifier was extensively tested and \nhas  been  successfully  in  operation  for  over  10,000  hours.  The  Council  of  Scientific  and \nIndustrial  Research  Organizations  in  Australia  further  tested  this  prototype  gasifier  using \nimported coal and found it satisfactory. The scaling-up of the prototype is an industry norm. To \nfurther improve the reliability of the syngas supply for the Project, a syngas connection with the \nTianjin Alakali Plant is included, which will provide backup in case the gasifier breaks down, \nthus ensuring the reliability of electricity supply from the Project. \n \n58.  The potential risks related to the type or quantity of coal supplied to the IGCC power \nplant is minimal. The coal for the Project will be supplied by Shenhua Group, the largest coal \nproducer in the country and an equity partner in Greengen. The coal will be supplied from the \nShenhua's Shenfu-Dongsheng and Yitai No. 4 coalfields in Inner Mongolia and Shanxi and \ntransported by railway to the coal-unloading system in the Tianjin Alkali Plant adjacent to the \nProject. The railway connection and coal-unloading system is already constructed. No additional \nrailway or coal-unloading facility will be built for the IGCC power plant. HTICL and Shenhua \nsigned a long-term coal purchase agreement for the Project in October 2008. CHNG is the \nlargest generator in the PRC and has long-term contractual relationships with coal suppliers for \nmany power plants across the PRC.  \n \n59.  Project implementation risks are minimal. The Project is fully supported by MOST and \nNDRC and listed as one of the major projects for scientific development in the 11th FYP. The \nProject's feasibility report was rigorously reviewed by NDRC and other experts and finally \napproved on 9 May 2009. All other relevant national approvals are in place. Greengen has \nacquired the project site and its possible future extension for a scaled-up IGCC plant and an \nintegrated IGCC\u2013CCS plant. The key procurement of the gas turbine and coal gasifier was \nfinalized  before  feasibility  approval  to  improve  the  Project's  cost  estimates  and  refine  the \nfeasibility  report.39 Construction  work  was  formally  launched  on  6  July  2009.  Advanced \ncontracting following ADB guidelines is ongoing, with most procurement expected to be finalized \nby mid-2010. The Project readiness filter is in Appendix 16. \n \n60.  The capacity of CHNG and HTICL is sufficient for the construction and O&M of the first \nIGCC power plant in the PRC. CHNG pioneers clean coal technologies in the PRC. It has \nsuccessfully led the development of supercritical and USC technologies in power plants, which \n                                                 \n39 Early  finalization  of  these  critical  components  was  essential  to  ascertain  the  interfaces  and  proceed  with \npreliminary design with refined cost estimates. The coal gasifier is a proprietary item, and international competitive \nbidding was conducted for the gas turbine package. As these procurements were finalized much earlier, they are \nnot eligible for ADB financing or included in the procurement plan.  \n ", "18   \nhave promptly achieved their rated performance capacities. The latest USC plants are on a par \nwith or better than similar international plants. The staff of CHNG and Greengen, who has \nextensive  previous  experience  in  operating  large,  modern  coal-fired  power  plants,  will  be \nengaged to operate and maintain the Project. CHNG and Greengen are extensively recruiting \nand  training  young  graduates  with  chemical  engineering  backgrounds  to  complement  its \nextensive thermal power plant expertise. The suppliers' assistance with O&M (para. 24) will \nfurther strengthen the O&M capacity of the project staff, enhancing sustainability.    \n \n61.  Electricity tariffs in the PRC are regulated and approved by NDRC for individual power \nplants only towards the end of their construction. In the case of the Project, the feasibility report \nflagged a higher tariff of CNY0.56/kWh than the CNY0.38/kWh approved for conventional coal-\nfired power plants by NDRC in the project area. The Project is financially viable at this tariff of \nCNY0.56/kWh. Since NDRC has rigorously reviewed the feasibility report and approved it, the \nassociated risk of any lower tariff than in the feasibility report is minimal.   \n \nVI.

", "Appendix 2  23\nINTEGRATED GASIFICATION COMBINED CYCLE TECHNOLOGY \n \nA.  Coal Gasification \n \n1.  Coal gasification has existed longer than coal-fired electricity generation. Prior to the use \nof natural gas, coal gasification was used to produce gas for lighting and heating in the United \nStates and the United Kingdom in the early 19th century. Coal gasification was used in many \nindustrial applications because of its abundance and low price, replacing natural gas. In the \n1970s, an energy crisis brought resurgent interest in synthesis gas (syngas) as an energy \nalternative. Decades of research and development in coal gasification have created a mature \ntechnology  that  is  currently  being  scaled-up  for  clean  energy  and  chemical  feedstock \nproduction.  \n \n2.  In  coal  gasification,  steam,  and  oxygen  are  injected  under  high  temperature  and \npressure into a coal gasifier to produce combustible syngas\u2014a mixture of carbon monoxide, \nhydrogen and other gaseous compounds. After being cleaned of sulfide and impurities, syngas \ncan be burned in high-efficiency gas turbines to generate electricity. Coal gasification is a \nflexible  technology  to  produce  hydrogen,  which  is  recognized  as  a  potent  environmentally \ncleaner future source of energy. By the end of 2007, global gasification capacity had grown to \n56,238 megawatts (MW) thermal of syngas output from 144 plants.1 In the People's Republic of \nChina (PRC), coal gasification has been used for many decades, and 44 operating plants now \nconvert coal and petroleum residues into a variety of chemicals, fertilizers, and gaseous fuels. \nCurrent data show that the world's syngas capacity is projected to grow by another 17,135 MW \nthermal from 2008 to 2010, which is an increase of over 30%. Six of the 10 planned plants will \nbe in the PRC, all processing coal to produce chemicals, fertilizers, and methanol.  \n \nB.  Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle\u2014An Advanced Clean Coal Technology   \n \n3.  Integrated  gasification  combined  cycle  (IGCC)  is  a  technology  that  combines  coal \ngasification and combined cycle power generation. In a combined cycle power plant, syngas is \nburned in a high-efficiency gas turbine to generate the first source of electricity. To improve \nefficiency, heat is recovered from both the gasification process and the gas turbine exhaust to \nproduce steam. This steam is then used to drive a steam turbine to generate the second source \nof electricity. Thus, IGCC integrates a coal gasification unit with a combined cycle unit that \ncombines  a  gas  turbine  with  a  steam  turbine.  This  has  higher  thermal  efficiency  than \nconventional pulverized coal. The thermal efficiency of IGCC is expected to reach 50% or \nhigher, compared with 34%\u201340% in a conventional pulverized coal power plant; future concepts \nthat  incorporates  a  fuel  cell  could achieve  efficiency  nearly  twice  today's  coal  combustion \ntechnologies.2  \n \n4.  With growing concern about rising CO  emissions, especially from large coal-fired power \n2\nplants, coal gasification is gaining momentum with its higher efficiency, emission reductions, \nand mature technology. Many new plants have recently been announced.   \n \n                                                 \n1  National Energy Technology Laboratory, US Department of Energy. 2007.

IGCC  has  many  environmental  advantages  over  pulverized  coal.  The  foremost \nadvantage is that coal gasification provides the opportunity to remove impurities such as sulfur, \nmercury,  and  particulates  before  burning  the  fuel,  using  readily  available  technologies.  In \naddition, the ash produced is like glass, which can be recycled as concrete aggregate, unlike \nthe waste ash of pulverized coal power plants that must be put into landfills, occupying useful \nland  and  potentially  contaminating  groundwater.

The high cost of IGCC is the biggest obstacle to its integration in the power market. A \nrecent estimate indicates that the capital cost for IGCC is as high as $2,500 per kilowatt, about \ntwice the capital cost of pulverized coal.1 Table A2.2 lists the major coal-fired and/or petcoke-\nbased IGCC plants in the world. Most IGCC power plants in operation are of approximately \n200\u2013300 MW capacity. The Sarlux IGCC at the Saras oil refinery in Sardinia is the largest \noperating IGCC to date, producing 550 MW of electric power. With growing concerns about \nclimate  change  caused  by  CO   emissions,  and  stricter  emissions  requirements  from  local \n2\nenvironmental authorities especially in terms of mercury removal, IGCC plants are finding favor \nwith project developers in Europe and the United States, where multiple IGCC plants of up to \n800 MW capacity have been announced. IGCC also offers a unique advantage in burning lower-\ngrade  coal  and  coal  blended  with  biomass  in  the  gasifier,  which  suggests  even  wider \napplicability for the technology.  \n  \nTable A2.2: Coal- and/or Petcoke-Based IGCC Demonstration Power Plants \n      Commenced \nLocation  Fuel  Power Output  Operation \nNuon Buggenum, Netherlands  Coal/Biomass  250 MW  1994 \nWabash, USA  Coal/Petcoke  260 MW  1995 \nPolk, USA  Coal/Petcoke  250 MW  1996 \nPuertollano, Spain  Coal/Petcoke  335 MW  1997 \nPernis, Rotterdam  Petcoke  115 MW  1997 \n                                                 \n1  IEA.

Historically, the primary focus of clean coal technologies was on sulfur dioxide and \nparticulates. More recently, the focus has turned to near-zero emission technologies intended to \ntake the carbon out of coal combustion. Demonstration projects already funded include oxy \ncombustion and post-combustion capture. Many other projects, small and large, are in progress \naround the world, including in the PRC and other developing countries.  \n  \n8.  All of the currently available technologies (i.e., pre-combustion, oxy combustion, and \npost-combustion) for separating a concentrated CO  stream from a large power-generation plant \n2\nrequire both significant additional equipment and a significantly increased input of energy, when \ncompared with technologies without capture. This requires the development of economical \nmethods of carbon sequestration. A key driver for coal gasification is the innate capability of \ngasification technology to separate and capture CO  most effectively. Coal gasification units \n2\ncould be modified to separate CO  generated from the syngas before combustion and thus \n2\neffectively address the problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, IGCC has \nbeen viewed as the most cost-effective platform for long-term capture.2  \n \n9.  Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) or capture-ready discussions have often \nbeen confined to IGCC plants, with an implied or actual assumption that capture could not be \nretrofitted to other types of power plants, principally pulverized coal, or that no special provisions \nwere needed to make such combustion units capture-ready.3 This view is also implicit in United \nStates energy policy, 4 as evidenced by its funding of IGCC.,5 With restrictions on CO  emissions \n2\nin  the  future,  IGCC  represents  an  important  advancement  for  power  generation.  Public \ninformation identifies 50 projects for United States operation beyond 2010.6 \n \nD.  Clean Coal Technologies and IGCC Development in the PRC \n \n10.  Since the early 1990s, the PRC has been actively pursuing clean coal technologies. \nThere is a growing base for new high-efficiency supercritical and ultra-supercritical (USC) coal-\nfired units in operation in the PRC. By the end of 2007, seven domestically manufactured 1,000 \nMW class and two 600 MW class USC units had been commissioned, in addition to 226 \nsupercritical units with 600 MW. These efficient units greatly changed the paradigm of thermal \n                                                 \n2  Sekar, R. C., J. E. Parsons, H. J. Herzog, and H. D. Jacoby. 2005.

Since \nthen, the Government has continued its effort to build an IGCC demonstration plant.  \n \n11.  The PRC has the potential to be the single biggest market for IGCC because of its \nconsistently large capacity addition over the past 3 years and anticipated strong growth. In view \nof the PRC's strong domestic manufacturing capacity and abundant low-cost and high-quality \nhuman resources, the capital cost of IGCC in the PRC will very likely be cheaper than in the \nUnited States and Europe. Previous energy sector practices in the PRC demonstrate that the \ndevelopment and mass production of new technologies are cost-effective in the global joint \neffort against climate change, especially in the areas of energy efficiency improvement and \nemission reduction. \n \nE.  GreenGen Program in the PRC  \n \n12.  To support the development of IGCC and CCS technologies, the PRC announced in \n2005 its GreenGen program, which was launched in December 2005 with a mandate to lead the \nresearch, development, and demonstration of cleaner coal technologies leading to a near-zero \nemission coal-fired power plant by 2015. Greengen has identified a phased approach. In the \nfirst phase, it plans to implement a 250 MW coal-fired IGCC plant at Tianjin. The Project is \nsupported  by  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Technology  and  the  National  Development  and \nReform Commission and is listed as one of the major projects for scientific development in the \n11th Five-Year Plan under the National High-tech Research and Development Program. The \nProject is located in Tianjin Harbor Industrial Park and will be the first IGCC demonstration \nproject in the PRC. On completion, it will supply base-load electricity to the local grid and steam \nand heat to facilities in Tianjin Harbor Industrial Park. Construction of the Project has started \nand will be completed by June 2012.  \n \n13.

Tianjin IGCC Power Plant  \n \n14.  Tianjin IGCC power plant is located in Tianjin Harbor Industrial Park phase I, in Tianjin \nBinhai New Area and adjacent to the east side of Tianjin Alkali Plant. Tianjin Harbor Industrial \nPark is located in Tanggu district of Tianjin, 46 kilometers (km) from Tianjin city center, 38 km \nfrom Tianjin International Airport, and 2 km from Tianjin port. The industrial park is planned to \ncover 80 square km. The first phase of the industrial park is mainly for the chemical and \npetrochemical industries, while the second phase is primarily for shipbuilding and ship-repair, \nequipment manufacture, metal processing, and some manufacturing. The third phase will also \ninclude major chemical industries.  \n \n15.  The North-West Electricity Research Institute is the overall designer of the Project, \nsupported by Thermal Power Research Institute, Xian and Wuhan Engineering Company Ltd.  \nThe key components of the Tianjin IGCC Power Plant include (i) a 2,000 tons/day coal gasifier; \n(ii) a 172.8 MW gas turbine generator; (iii) a 94.5 MW steam turbine generator; and (iv) 200 \nkilovolt  (kV)  gas  insulated  switchgear.  On  completion,  the  Tianjin  IGCC  power  plant  will \ngenerate 1,470 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually, which will be evacuated through a 220 kV \ntransmission line to an existing substation for connection with the Tianjin power grid. The Tianjin \npower grid is connected to the North China Power Grid through 500 kV transmission lines.  \n \n ", "28  Appendix 3 \nSECTOR ANALYSIS \n \nA.  Overview of the People\u2019s Republic of China Power Sector \n \n1.  The People's Republic of China (PRC), with a population of 1.3 billion and an economy \ngrowing at an average annual rate of over 9.5% in the past 2 decades, has become one of the \nlargest energy producers and the second largest energy consumer in the world. By 2008, total \ninstalled power-generation capacity had reached 793 gigawatt, and annual electricity generation \nwas  3,433  billion  kilowatt-hours.1 In  view  of  accelerated  urbanization  and  industrialization, \npower-generation capacity is expected to continue to increase in the foreseeable future. Table \nA3 shows the annual capacity addition of new power plants and total installed capacity during \n2000\u20132008.  \n \nTable A3: PRC: Annual Addition of Power Generation Capacity and Generation \nYear  2000  2001  2002  2003  2004  2005  2006  2007  2008 \nAnnual capacity \n20  19  43  34  51  67  91  91  79 \naddition (GW) \nTotal installed  \n317.0  336.0  379.0  413.0  464.0  531.0  622.0  713.0  792.5 \ncapacity (GW) \nTotal generation \n1,355.6  1,471.7  1,640.5  1,906.7  2,187.0  2,497.5  2,834.4  3,255.9  3,433.4 \n(TWh) \nGW = gigawatt, TWh = terawatt-hour. \nSource: China Electricity Council. 2007.

While the PRC has been taking steps to diversify energy resources, especially nuclear \npower and non-hydro renewables, it remains heavily dependent on coal as primary energy and \nfuel for power generation. Coal accounts for 70% of total primary energy consumption, which is \nfar above the world average of 26%.2 Non-hydro renewable energy has been expanding rapidly \nsince 2006 but faces the challenges of higher cost than coal-fired power plants and long \ntransmission lines. In 2008, thermal power generation accounted for 80.9% of power generation \nin the country. Hydropower constituted 16.4%, and nuclear, wind, and other energy resources \ncontributed the remaining 2.7%, including less than 0.5% from wind.   \n \n3.  Electricity consumption is dominated by energy-intensive heavy industries, including \ncement, metallurgy, petrochemicals, chemicals, clay and porcelain, glass, papermaking, textiles,  \nand other manufacturing industries. Heavy industry alone accounts for 61% of total electricity \nconsumption, while residential consumption is only 12%.  \n \n4.  Energy efficiency has been a high priority for PRC policy makers and has gained even \ngreater prominence over the past few years as the main approach to addressing both energy \nsecurity  and  environmental  concerns.3 The  Government  of  the  PRC  has  identified  power \ngeneration as a priority sector to be targeted to improve energy efficiency. Compared with \ninternational best practice, there is still large scope for improvement.  \n \nB.  Sector Governance  \n \n5.  Sustained and impressive growth for more than 2 decades is testimony to the sector's \nability to meet the need for additional capacity. The Government has set out to transform the \n                                                 \n1  Electricity generation and related data in this appendix are from China Electricity Council. 2008.

Its generating assets were reallocated to five generating \ncompanies:  China  Datang  Corporation,  China  Huadian  Corporation,  China  Guodian \nCorporation, and China Power Investment Corporation and its transmission and distribution \nassets were split between two grid companies: State Grid and China Southern Grid. \n \n6.  The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) is the sector's top planning \nand regulatory agency. Recognizing the strategic importance of energy to the economy, the \nState  Council  upgraded  the  Energy  Bureau  of  NDRC  to  become  the  National  Energy \nAdministration in 2008. Although the administration is still under the supervision of NDRC, it \nreports directly to the State Council. The State Electricity Regulatory Commission has since \n2003 overseen regulating the electricity subsector.  \n \nC.  Sector Reforms   \n \n7.  As other energy subsectors, i.e., coal, oil, and gas, have been considerably deregulated \nand become more flexible in determining prices, electricity is still in transition. Current electricity \npricing regulation needs to be understood in the broader context of its single-buyer model for \npower transactions. In general, generators sell power to the grid companies at regulated prices, \nand the grid companies sell the power to end-users also at regulated prices. Although the State \nElectricity Regulatory Commission was established in 2003, NDRC still sets the electricity tariff \nbased on the costs of power generation, transmission, and distribution, including a reasonable \nrate of return on investments. NDRC has gradually reformed the electricity tariff structure in the \npast  few  years,  in  part  to  encourage  improvements  in  efficiency.  The  prices  paid  to  new \ngenerators are set according to the technologies in use in each province. For example, within a \nprovince, all new coal-fired plants with desulfurization are paid the same price, which is different \nfrom the price paid to other technologies such as hydropower. The efficiency of energy-intensive \nindustries  was  reviewed  and  categorized  by  energy  efficiency.  Price  discounts  have  been \nabolished and surcharges increased for the least efficient. This pricing policy has been quite \neffective. By 2006, about 1,200 high energy-consuming enterprises were understood to have \nshut  down,  suspended  operations,  invested  in  energy  efficiency,  or  changed  production \nprocesses. \n \nD.  Future Reforms in the PRC \n \n8.  The PRC electricity industry needs constructive restructuring and more rapid movement \ntowards  market  mechanisms.  Some  key  initiatives  like  efficiency-based  load  dispatch  and \nelectricity markets are being piloted and are expected to be gradually introduced under the 12th \nFive-Year Plan 2011\u20132015. With growing concerns about global warming and climate change, \nthe challenge will be to reduce the carbon intensity of its electricity generation significantly by \n2020. Future electricity policies have to encourage technology innovations and the efficient use \nof  limited  resources  and  balance  them  with  long-term  social  welfare.  This  may  mean  a \ncombination of energy-efficient technologies being powered by a range of renewable and fossil \nfuels.  The  future  electricity  policy  framework  should  include  a  mechanism  through  which \nelectricity firms are pushed to pursue higher production efficiency.  \n ", "30  Appendix 4 \nEXTERNAL ASSISTANCE AND ITS LESSONS  \n \nA.  External Assistance \n \n1.  Since 1987, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has approved assistance for more than \n30 energy projects totaling $3.6 billion to the Government of the People's Republic of China \n(PRC). The assistance has been divided evenly between projects that increased energy supply \n($1.8  billion)  and  those  that  improved  the  environment  ($1.8  billion).  About  47%  was  for \nhydropower, pumped-storage, and coal-mine methane projects; 20% for transmission lines; and \n33% for thermal power. Since 2000, more attention has been paid to environment and climate \nchange issues, and there has been a focus on projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, \nand capture of coal-mine and coal-bed methane. These projects not only helped the PRC \nexpand its power supply capacity but also directly reduced coal consumption and consequently \nreduced emissions of pollutants, including greenhouse gases linked to global climate change. \n \n2.  ADB has also provided about 100 technical assistance (TA) projects for the energy \nsector, costing about $50 million, to help prepare projects, provide policy advice, and build the \ninstitutional  capability  of  utilities  (power,  district  heat,  and  urban  gas  supply)  that  are  the \nimplementing agencies of ADB loans. ADB provided TA projects to help restructure the power \nsubsector, formulate power-pricing strategy, improve the power-planning process, and establish \nthe  State  Electricity  Regulatory  Commission.  TA  also  covered  clean  production,1 energy \nconservation,2 energy efficiency,3 and environmental management.4 ADB is currently conducting \na  comprehensive  study  jointly  with  the  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission  to \nanalyze  the  opportunities  and  challenges  for  promoting  energy  efficiency  and  renewable \nenergy.5 It  will  make  practical  policy  recommendations  to  overcome  barriers,  facilitate  the \nimplementation of development strategies and industrial policies, explore innovative approaches \nto utilizing external assistance, and identify key provinces and projects for piloting high-impact \nclean energy projects. \n \n3.  ADB has also extended two project loans totaling $90 million to the private sector for \npower generation. Its Private Sector Operations Department is now providing a program of \npartial credit risk guarantees with an overall limit of CNY800 million to cover an agreed portion \n(about 48% of the portfolio) of principal repayment of loans extended by selected partner banks \nto finance energy efficiency projects. This innovative mechanism can mobilize domestic banks \nto  provide  loans  for  energy  efficiency  projects  by  reducing  performance  uncertainties  and \nsharing credit risks.  \n \n4.  Other major multilateral agencies active in the PRC also support the energy sector. The \nWorld Bank has been the largest multilateral funder for PRC power sector. Since the early \n1990s, it has provided more than $6.2 billion to finance 25 projects, most of which are large \nthermal and hydropower generation projects and power transmission and distribution projects. \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998.

The United Nations Development Programme is \nproviding assistance for studies regarding options for power sector restructuring and promoting \nenergy conservation. The ongoing China End-Use Energy Efficiency Project aims to promote \nenergy  efficiency  in  major  energy-consuming  sectors  such  as  industries  and  building \nconstruction.  \n \n5.  Among bilateral sources, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation is the largest \nsource of external assistance for the PRC\u2019s power subsector. It has provided concessional \nloans totaling CNY438 billion for 14 power projects through its official development assistance \nwindow. It has also provided special credits to major cities to improve their environment by \ninstalling emission-control devices and equipment in power plants and factories and by building \nwater-treatment facilities. It is considering shifting its traditional focus of assistance in the power \nsubsector  from  hydropower  and  thermal  power  generation  to  energy  conservation  and \nrenewable energy, particularly in the western region. German development cooperation through \nKfW has approved approximately $400 million in mixed credits, mostly for power plants and \nturbine-modernization  projects.  It  also  supported  the  Government  in  energy  efficiency  and \nrenewable energy development. Other bilateral sources providing export credits or mixed credits \nin the energy sector include Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Spain, the United \nKingdom, and the United States.  \n \n6.  Close  cooperation  among  development  partners  has  been  pursued  through  regular \nmeetings.7 ADB  has  established  a  working  relationship  with  the  World  Bank  and  other \nmultilateral and bilateral agencies toward addressing policy issues and coordinating lending and \nTA operations. Both ADB and the World Bank emphasize the importance of energy efficiency \nimprovement, promoting clean energy, environmental protection, and a greater role for the \nprivate sector in clean energy financing. Annual aid-coordination meetings are held in Beijing to \nshare strategies.  \n \nB.  Lessons \n \n7.  ADB\u2019s experience with energy projects in the PRC has been positive. Projects are \ngenerally well designed and smoothly implemented, though front-end delays have occurred in \nsome projects. Success is attributed to extensive preparation prior to ADB intervention, high \nsense of local ownership, effective leadership in project management offices, and timely policy \nand enterprise reforms. The front-end delays in loan signing and loan effectiveness did not lead \nto  unsatisfactory  performance.  The  Government  has  implemented  reforms  on  investment \nregulations  that  simplify  approval  procedures  and  delegate  some  approving  authority  to \nprovincial governments. ADB has worked closely with the Government to harmonize the two \napproval procedures to minimize project start-up and implementation delays. \n \n8.  The  implementation  performance  of  the  energy  portfolio  is  satisfactory. 8  Project \ncompletion and performance evaluation reports for ADB-financed projects in the PRC highlight \nthe (i) need to improve financial reporting; (ii) need for more attention to environmental matters; \n                                                 \n6  World Bank. 1998.

The World Bank review of experience in energy efficiency has shown that projects \nshould seek to test a variety of business models to achieve energy savings. In particular, access \nto appropriate project financing that supports energy service company transactions should be \nintegral to project design. It suggests that procurement and disbursement procedures should be \nsimplified, as they increase transaction costs and discourage energy efficiency.9 \n \n10.  These  lessons  were  taken  into  account  when  designing  and  preparing  the  Project. \nDuring preparation, lessons were addressed by (i) thoroughly reviewing project readiness on \nkey  factors  that  may  delay  start-up,  (ii)  carefully  assessing  institutional  capacity  and \nstrengthening measures to improve corporate governance, (iii) providing conservative estimates \nof the expected tariff consistent with existing policies and practices, and (iv) setting up project \nimplementing units with autonomy for operations and procurement decisions.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n9  World Bank. 2004.

Business Scope \n \n1.  The Export-Import Bank of China (EXIM Bank) is a state policy bank of the People's \nRepublic of China (PRC) under the direct leadership of the State Council. It was established in \n1994 and is solely owned by the Government of the PRC. EXIM Bank is headquartered in \nBeijing and has over 10 business branches and domestic representative offices, as well as \nthree overseas representative offices, in Johannesburg, Paris, and St. Petersburg. It maintains \ncorrespondent relationships with more than 300 overseas banks worldwide. \n \n2.  EXIM Bank plays an important role in supporting the PRC's foreign trade and economic \ndevelopment. It provides policy financing for exports as well as for imports of mechanical, \nelectronic, and new high-technology products and equipment, and it has provided assistance for \noffshore construction contracts as well as overseas investment projects. EXIM Bank is the major \nonlending  bank  of  foreign  government  and  international  financial  institution  loans  and  is \nmandated as the sole lending bank for the PRC's concessionary loans. \n \nB.  Onlending of Foreign Loans \n \n3.  In the face of challenges arising from reduced loan amounts offered by some foreign \ngovernments  and  fierce  market  competition  for  traditional  onlending  products,  EXIM  Bank \nrefocused its business philosophy and adopted measures to remain competitive. It took active \nsteps to tap growth potential in the onlending business by adding new countries, businesses, \nand product varieties to its list. Utilizing foreign funds, EXIM Bank has supported key projects in \ninfrastructure,  medical  care,  education,  and  environment  protection  and  has  contributed  to \nimplementing the national strategy of developing the western region of the PRC. In 2007, EXIM \nBank signed onlending agreements with a total value of $950 million for 47 projects. Total \noutstanding loans at end-2007 were worth $18.94 billion. To date, EXIM Bank has onlent loans \nprovided by 22 foreign governments and five international financial institutions, including the \nWorld Bank and European Investment Bank. \n \n4.  EXIM  Bank  categorizes  its  onlending  activities  into  three  types  depending  on  the \nclassification of the borrower and who is responsible for repayment. It charges a standard fee \nfor onlending. The Tianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant is classified as \ntype I, wherein a state-owned enterprise (China Huaneng Group) under the State Council bears \nrepayment obligation. EXIM Bank charges an onlending fee of 0.15% for the size of Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) financing envisioned for the Project.  \n \nC.  Financial Status \n \n5.  At the end of 2007, EXIM Bank's total asset value was CNY378.74 billion. Phenomenal \ngrowth rates in total assets reached 47.3% in 2005, 26.1% in 2006, and 46.6% in 2007. Profit \nafter tax in 2007 was CNY109.4 million. The growth rates in profit after tax were 79.1% in 2005, \n23.2% in 2006, and 23.6% in 2007. EXIM Bank has been, and continues to be, a fast-growing \nentity accompanying rapid economic development in the PRC. \n \nD.  Credit Ratings \n \n6.

This appendix describes the notes and assumptions used in the financial analysis of the \nTianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant Project. The financial analysis was \nprepared in accordance with the Asian Development Bank Financial Management and Analysis \nof Projects.1 All costs and prices are expressed in constant 2009 prices. The economic life of \nthe Project is estimated at 25 years with residual value assumed for the civil works and land-use \nright. The financial operation of the project implementing agency, Huaneng Tianjin IGCC Co. \nLtd., was projected based on the assumptions described in Appendix 12. The projected financial \nstatements are shown in Supplementary Appendix C. \n \nB.  Revenues and Costs \n \n2.  Revenues from the Project will be derived from the sale of electricity generated by the \npower plant based on projected yearly net generation of 249 gigawatt-hours in 2011 and 1,245 \nGWh from 2015 and the tariff of CNY0.56 assumed in the project feasibility study approved by \nthe National Development and Reform Commission. A tariff in this range is a major factor in the \nProject's viability.  \n \n3.  The capital cost includes physical contingencies but excludes price contingencies and \nfinancial charges during development. Operating and maintenance costs include personnel \nsalaries and welfare costs, plant and equipment maintenance costs, administration, insurance, \ntaxes, and other expenses. \n \nC.  Financial Internal Rate of Return \n \n4.  The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) of the Project was calculated as shown in \nTable A11.1. The FIRR is 6.4%, higher than the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) \nestimated at 3.7%, and the financial net present value is CNY820.9 million at this WACC. The \nProject is considered financially feasible. Sensitivity analysis shows that the FIRR is robust \nunder various adverse conditions, as shown in Table A11.2. \n \nTable A11.1: Financial Internal Rate of Return for \nTianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant \n(CNY million) \n          Net Cash \n  Capital    Operating  Income  Flow After \nYear  Costs  Revenues Costs  Taxes  Tax \n2009  574.09         (574.09) \n2010  1,083.09         (1,083.09) \n2011  969.83   89.94   1.06   125.15   (935.68) \n2012    152.53   9.30   253.24   91.41  \n2013    246.41   20.74   440.52   173.37  \n2014    309.00   28.37   565.37   228.01  \n2015    340.29   32.18   627.80   255.33  \n2016    340.29   32.18   627.80   255.33  \n2017    340.29   32.18   627.80   255.33  \n2018    340.29   42.83   627.80   244.68  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2005.

Project Executing and Implementing Agencies \n \n1.  China  Huaneng  Group  (CHNG)  is  the  Executing  Agency  for  the  Tianjin  Integrated \nGasification Combined Cycle Power Plant Project. It is the managing partner of Greengen, \nwhich in turn established Huaneng Tianjin IGCC Co., Ltd. (HTICL) with the mandate to develop \nthe Project and be the implementing agency (IA). This separate project entity approach is \nconsidered prudent as it (i) brings transparency, (ii) improves accountability and corporate \ngovernance,  and  (iii)  ensures  a  task  force  approach  to  project  development  that  provides \nmanagement focus. The project implementation organization structure is in Appendix 7. \n \n1.  China Huaneng Group \n \n2.  CHNG is a state-owned enterprise (SOE) under the direct jurisdiction of the Government \nof the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC) and is a leading group in the PRC's power sector. It \nwas established in 1985 with registered capital of CNY20 billion. In December 2002, when the \nPRC's power sector was reorganized, CHNG received about one-fifth of the assets of the \ndissolved State Power Corporation, along with the four other state-owned power-generating \ncompanies.1 CHNG has developed into a large group comprised of wholly owned or controlled \nsubsidiaries with regional branches and offices both in the PRC and abroad. CHNG conducts \nbusiness independently and bears full responsibility for its profits and losses. It has a diversified \nbusiness portfolio with power generation at its core. One of its biggest subsidiaries, Huaneng \nPower International, is listed on the Hong Kong and New York stock exchanges. \n \n3.  CHNG lists the following as its business areas: (i) management of its state-owned assets \nand subsidiaries; (ii) investment, construction, operation, and management of power-generation \nassets  and  the  production  and  sale  of  power  and  heat;  (iii)  investment,  construction,  and \noperation  of  businesses  in  information  technology,  transportation,  renewable  energy, \nenvironment  protection,  trade,  and  fuel;  (iv)  businesses  associated  with  foreign  trade  and \ninternational  cooperation;  and  (v)  investment  and  financing  in  domestic  and  international \nmarkets. \n \n4.  As of end-2008, CHNG's total installed capacity was 86 gigawatts (GW), and its 2008 \nelectricity production was 364.5 terrawatt-hours, about 10.5% of the national total, making it the \nlargest power producer in the PRC. Its power plants are located in economically vibrant regions \nwhere power demand is very strong. The company attributes its success to its strength in the \nfollowing areas: (i) advanced equipment, efficient generating units, and steady operations; (ii) a \nhigh-quality employee base and experienced management team; (iii) a standardized corporate \ngovernance  structure  and  scientific  decision-making  mechanism;  (iv)  strategically  located \npower-generating assets and bright market prospects; and (v) sound creditworthiness both \ndomestically and internationally and rich experience in capital market operation. \n \n5.  CHNG has a rigorous and sound accounting system, internal control procedures, and \nexperienced and qualified financial and internal auditing staff. CHNG is in a position to provide \nto both Greengen and HTICL the guidance and monitoring needed to improve their financial \nperformance and systems for accounting, internal control, and risk management. \n                                                 \n1  The State Power Corporation was a SOE that held 50% of the total power-generating capacity in the PRC before \npower sector restructuring in December 2002. The four other power-generation companies that received assets \nfrom State Power were China Datang Corporation, China Huadian Corporation, China Guodian Corporation, and \nChina Power Investment Corporation. \n   ", "46  Appendix 12 \n6.  As part of its development strategy, by 2010, CHNG will increase its generation capacity \nto over 100 GW. Its sales revenue is projected to reach $10 billion, making it one of the world\u2019s \nlargest 500 companies. CHNG has identified capacity development, technical competence and \ninnovation, and risk endurance among its strategies to become globally competitive.  \n \n2.  Greengen Co. Ltd. \n \n7.  Greengen  was  established  as  a  limited  liability  company  in  December  2005  with \nregistered  capital  of  CNY300  million.  Its  business  involves  researching,  developing,  and \nproviding consulting services on clean coal technology for power plants, as well as constructing, \noperating, and managing power plants that promote clean coal technologies toward near-zero \nemissions. The Project is the initial undertaking in its development program, which envisions \nputting in place 1,050 MW of integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) capacity by 2015. \nCHNG holds 51% of Greengen's shares, while the other seven shareholders2 are the major \npower-related SOEs in the PRC, each holding 7% of the shares. \n \n8.  Greengen  will  exercise  supervisory  functions  over  HTICL  and  perform  most  of  the \nExecuting Agency's role for the Project, on behalf of CHNG. For the Project, Greengen will \n(i)  review  and  approve  procurement,  contractor  payments,  and  reimbursement \napplications; \n(ii)  monitor project implementation; \n(iii)  review counterpart fund utilization and the progress of loan utilization; \n(iv)  review financial and physical progress reports; \n(v)  review or prepare reports for submission to the Government as necessary; \n(vi)  review quarterly progress reports for submission to the Asian Development Bank \n(ADB); and \n(vii)  conduct correspondence with ADB as necessary. \n \n9.  An  assessment  based  on  the  completed  financial  management  assessment \nquestionnaire  indicates  that  accrual  basis  accounting  and  PRC  accounting  standards  are \nfollowed. Existing accounting procedures are aligned with regulations and policies issued by the \nMinistry of Finance (MOF). A computerized accounting system is in place, and the company has \na complete set of accounting procedures for recording and processing transactions. Internal \ncontrol is effective. Separation of functions for authorization, transaction, recording, and asset \nmanagement is well established under existing accounting procedures. A rigorous budgeting \nsystem is uniformly implemented within CHNG, and the budget contains both financial and \nphysical indicators that are compared with actual performance, which is monitored monthly. The \nsame accounting systems and procedures will be used for the Project. There is no internal audit \ndepartment in Greengen yet, but the internal auditor in CHNG can be designated to conduct \ninternal  audit  periodically  or  as  needed.  The  external  audit  of  its  financial  statements  is \nconducted annually by an independent accounting firm designated by CHNG.  \n \n10.  Being a newly established entity, Greengen as a company does not have any previous \nexperience in project management or in dealing with international finance institutions. However, \nas most senior staff come from CHNG, its management team has very strong capacity. Training \nin project management, as well as in ADB's guidelines and procedures on procurement and \ndisbursement and on safeguard mechanisms, have been identified as areas for improvement. \nSince Greengen is purely an investment company with no operating revenues in previous years, \n                                                 \n2  These enterprises are China Datang Corporation, China Huadian Corporation, China Guodian Corporation, China \nPower Investment Corporation, Shenhua Group Corporation Ltd., China National Coal Group Corporation, and \nState Development and Investment Corporation. ", "Appendix 12  47\nand  with  the  Tianjin  IGCC  project  being  its  first  and  only  project,  it  was  not  considered \nnecessary to assess Greengen on its own profitability and sustainability. Therefore, only HTICL \nwill be assessed in terms of its financial prospects. \n \n3.  Huaneng Tianjin IGCC Co. Ltd. \n \n11.  HTICL was registered as a limited liability company under PRC law in November 2008 \nwith authorized share capital of CNY200 million held by Greengen (75%) and Tianjin Jinneng \nInvestment Company (25%). As IA, HTICL will be responsible for project management and \nimplementation. Consistent compliance with PRC accounting standards and systems is required \nto ensure accurate and timely interpretation of financial performance and that Project costs and \nexpenditures  are  used  economically,  efficiently,  and  for  the  purposes  stated  in  any  loan \nagreement.  The  organization  structure,  functions,  and  financial  management  of  the  new \ncompany was reviewed during project processing. The organization chart of HTICL is simple, \nwith a staff of 114. Accounting systems and processes, as well as internal control procedures, \nare patterned after those of Greengen. HTICL uses the same accounting software, which can \nproduce the financial statements and reports required by MOF under a special regulation issued \nin January 2000. No historical audited financial statements are yet available for review. The \nproposed Project will be audited by a special auditing agency to be designated by MOF. HTICL \nrecently recruited internal auditors to enhance monitoring and control in the organization. \n \n12.  HTICL's financial management and reporting responsibilities will include  \n(i)  certificating contractor payments; \n(ii)  preparing reimbursement applications; \n(iii)  monitoring counterpart fund utilization and the progress of loan utilization; \n(iv)  maintaining consolidated financial and physical progress reports; \n(v)  preparing reports for submission to the Government as necessary; \n(vi)  preparing quarterly progress reports for submission to ADB; and \n(vii)  conducting all correspondence with ADB. \n \nB.  Financial Performance and Projections \n13.  Financial performance can be analyzed only for CHNG. An analysis of the company\u2019s \nfinancial statements for the past 4 years was done following ADB's Financial Management and \nAnalysis of Projects.3 The audited financial statements of CHNG show that the company\u2019s \nfinancial condition has been fairly sound except in 2008, when its operations were not spared by \nthe global financial crisis. That year was very difficult for CHNG, as the costs of coal and \nmaterials sharply increased but the Government kept power tariffs unchanged. As a result, the \ncompany sustained a net loss of CNY6.78 billion (4.5% of sales), and net cash flow from \noperating activities decreased by 74% compared with the previous year. From 2005 to 2007, its \nsales increased by 52%, and net income after tax increased by 522%. Yearly net operating \nincome was around 10% of sales, while net income after tax was about 9% in 2007. \n \n14.  CHNG's financial position was also fairly sound, with shareholders' equity comprising \nover 40% of its capital structure. However, it is observed that the company has large amounts of \nshort-term debt maintained over the years. If the short-term debts were to be considered in the \ndetermination of its capital structure, the equity position would be about 33% in 2005, dropping \nto 28% in 2008. High short-term debt adversely affected the current ratio, which was less than \n1.0, with current liabilities exceeding current assets. The debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) \nwas also below 1.0 because of payment on short maturities, which account for 45% of total debt. \n                                                 \n3  ADB. 2005. Financial Management and Analysis of Projects. Manila. \n   ", "48  Appendix 12 \nThese debts were incurred to fund rapid expansion to meet growing demand for electricity in \nrecent years and to finance the working capital requirements brought about by increasing input \ncosts. The national directive to meet environmental protection standards and promote energy \nefficiency also had a toll on CHNG's financial position, and the company thus had to resort to \nmore borrowing in the absence of additional equity injected by the Government. \n \n15.  Since short-term maturities are being refinanced, the DSCR would be much higher if the \ndebt service data shown in the audited financial statements could be disaggregated to consider \nonly long-term debts. Nevertheless, the company needs to carefully look into its short-term \nliability in relation to its overall capital structure, as the very low current ratio and DSCR indicate \nhigh financial risk in the short run. \n \n16.  Historical  and  projected  financial  statements  and  key  financial  indicators  are  in \nSupplementary Appendix C.  \n \nC.  Assumptions Used for Financial Projections \n \n17.  China Huaneng Group. Financial projections were based on historical data for 2005\u2013\n2007, as 2008 was truly abnormal and cannot be regarded as a basis for projections. The \nprojections are consistent with the company\u2019s business program for the next decade and reflect \nCHNG's vision of maintaining its lead in the power generation market in the PRC and promoting \nrenewable and clean energy projects while, at the same time, achieving global competitiveness \nand making inroads into the international energy market. \n \n18.  CHNG\u2019s revenues will increase from CNY151.37 billion in 2008 to CNY203.44 billion in \n2018, raising its total assets from CNY463.59 billion to CNY518.33 billion in the same period. \nThe return on net fixed assets will rise from \u20132.14% in 2008 to nearly 2% in 2018. Although the \ncurrent ratio and debt-service ratio are increasing gradually, the figures will still be low, which \nsuggests the need for CHNG to closely examine its funding strategy and debt structure.  \n \n19.  Key financial accounts and indicators are shown in Table A12.1. The indicators show \ngradual and sustained improvement in the future financial position of CHNG. \n \nTable A12.1: Financial Performance and Projections \nChina Huaneng Group \n  Actual    Projected \nYear ending December 31  2005  2006  2007  2008    2009  2011  2015 \nFinancial Accounts (CNY billion)                 \n   Operating Revenues  73.64   84.15  111.63  151.37  155.92   165.41  186.17 \n   Net Operating Income  7.51   8.99  10.41  (6.71) 11.57   13.41  16.37 \n   Net Income After Tax  1.33   2.16  8.28  (6.78) 5.13   5.95  7.43 \n   Total Assets  226.89   286.07  374.30  463.59  421.27   441.28  481.59 \n   Net Fixed Assets  182.58   227.38  258.25  316.96  317.58   340.79  383.56 \n   Accounts Receivables  9.42   11.94  14.13  15.98  19.07   20.23  22.77 \n   Current Assets  30.21  36.54 66.43 77.40 61.97  61.82 62.56\n   Current Liabilities  62.28   89.93  125.92  160.99  135.81   134.29  128.42 \n   Long-Term Liabilities  91.13   118.03  156.65  221.20  198.69   209.05  228.09 \n   Equity  73.48   78.10  91.74  81.40  86.77   97.93  125.08 \n   Net Internal Cash Generation  18.65   26.14  26.06  6.79  41.00   44.80  51.41 ", "Appendix 12  49\n  Actual    Projected \nYear ending December 31  2005  2006  2007  2008    2009  2011  2015 \nFinancial Ratios     \n   Operating Ratioa (%)  89.80   89.31  90.67  104.43  92.58   91.89  91.21 \n   Return on Net Fixed Assetsb (%)  0.73   0.95  3.21  (2.14) 1.61   1.74  1.94 \n   Current Ratioc (times)     1.54   1.70  1.52  1.27  1.47   1.47  1.47 \n   Accounts Receivables d (months)  0.49   0.41  0.53  0.48  0.46   0.46  0.49 \n   Debt/(Debt & Equity) Ratioe (%)  52.14   57.32  59.11  69.36  65.09   63.94  60.97 \n   Debt Service Ratiof (times)  0.36   0.37  0.26  0.05  0.34   0.35  0.36 \nCNY = yuan. \na  Total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues. \nb  Net operating income after taxes plus loan interest as a percentage of rate base. \nc  Current assets to current liabilities. \nd  Number of months\u2019 sales in accounts receivables. \ne  Ratio of long-term debt to long-term debt plus equity. \nf  Ratio of internal cash generation to debt service requirement. \nSources: Company financial statements and Asian Development Bank estimates. \n \n20.  Huaneng Tianjin IGCC Co. Ltd. Financial projections for HTICL are essentially based \non the impact of the Project on the company's financial statements. The Project is assessed to \nbe financially viable. The financial operations of the project company were projected for 2011\u2013\n2020  based  on  the  major  assumptions  described  below.  The  capital  investment  program \nconsiders only the ADB-funded project. Annual investment outlays were adjusted using the \nprojected annual escalation factors used in ADB projects. The projections use an exchange rate \nof CNY6.83 to $1.00. After project completion, no major capital expenditures are expected \nthroughout the project life. The expected economic life of the Project is 25 years, with residual \nvalue assumed for the civil works and land-use right. \n \n21.  Under the proposed loan, HTICL will be required to maintain a DSCR of at least 1.2 \ntimes, rising to 1.3 times by 2016; a return on net fixed assets of not less than 6.0% from 2015 \nonwards; accounts receivable not exceeding the equivalent of 3 months of sales; and a debt\u2013\nequity ratio at a maximum of 80:20 until 2015 and 70:30 thereafter. To ensure that this set of \nfinancial covenants is translated into appropriate financial policies and measures, HTICL will \nprovide ADB each year with its rolling 10-year financial projections, showing how it proposes to \nmeet the covenanted targets. The financial covenants of ADB are expected to be satisfied \nduring the life of the Project. The DSCR is forecasted to be adequate throughout. The debt\u2013\nequity ratio will be within the prescribed maximum limit. Other financial ratios are expected to \nremain satisfactory. \n \n1.  Revenues \n \n22.  Plant commissioning and trial runs are expected in 2012, with only 20% of the expected \nyearly volume generated. Thereafter, plant capacity utilization will be 40% in 2013, 70% in 2014, \nand 100% in 2015. Yearly electricity sales of 1,245 gigawatt-hours (GWh) are expected from \n2015. This sales volume considered the gross generation of 1,470.5 GWh based on normal \nutilization of 5,500 hours a year, net of 15.2% for station use and loss. The plant utilization \nfactor is 60%. The actual tariff for the plant will be determined by the National Development and \nReform Commission at the commencement of the plant\u2019s operation based on the Project\u2019s \nactual investment and estimated operating costs. The generation tariff of CNY0.5608 used in \nthe approved feasibility study was assumed. While this tariff is crucial to the viability of the \nProject, it is lower than the proposed tariff for most approved large wind power projects in the \nPRC. Table A12.2, published in March 2009 on the China Wind Power website, shows the \n   ", "50  Appendix 12 \ntariffs of 20 existing wind power projects, ranked from highest to lowest. Among those listed, \nonly three projects, or 15%, have tariffs below CNY0.6 per kilowatt-hour (kWh). Half of them \nobtained a tariff above CNY0.7/kWh. The assumed tariff for this Project is therefore quite \ncompetitive to those for wind power projects. \n \nTable A12.2: Tariffs for Wind Power Projects Approved by NDRC \n    Tariff \n    (CNY/kWh, \nNo.  Project Name  including VAT) \n1.

Operating, Maintenance, and Other Expenses \n \n23.  Consumption of standard coal is 275 kilograms per megawatt-hour (MWh), bringing \nannual coal consumption to around 400,000 ton (t). The coal price is estimated to be CNY575/t, \nincluding 13% value-added tax (VAT). Operating and other local expenses are adjusted for \ninflation. An estimated 300 workers will be required to run the Project at an average annual \nsalary of CNY45,000 per worker. Other employee welfare benefits are estimated at 60% of \nsalary. \n \n24.  Other cost assumptions considered in the feasibility study include the cost of materials \ncalculated  at  a  rate  of  CNY13/MWh  and  the  cost  of  other  items  including  administrative \nexpenses estimated at a rate of CNY12/MWh. Insurance is estimated at 0.25% each year on \nthe original value of civil works and equipment. Categories of fixed assets are depreciated using \nthe straight line depreciation method at different annual depreciation rates in accordance with \nthe PRC\u2019s guidelines, i.e., 2% for land-use rights, 3.3% for civil works, 5% for equipment, and \n20% for amortization of other intangible assets. A fund for equipment overhaul is withheld each \nyear at 3.3% on the capital cost of equipment.  \n \n3.  Interest on Long-Term Debts and Taxes \n \n25.  Interest expenses on existing long-term debts are calculated based on prevailing loan \nterms. Interest on the ADB loan is calculated based on the current London inter-bank offered ", "Appendix 12  51\nrate (LIBOR) on the 10-year fixed-interest swap (currently at 4.00%), plus the ADB loan spread \nof 0.20%. The loans from local banks carry an interest rate of 5.94%, the prevailing rate \nprescribed for long-term loans by the People\u2019s Bank of China. The net income from the Project \nis subject to 25% income tax. HTICL will retain after-tax profit, and no dividends will be paid. \nOther local taxes include VAT of 17% on sales, a city maintenance and construction tax of 7%, \nand an education tax of 3% on VAT. For capital costs, a 5% construction tax on civil works and \n17% VAT on equipment value are adopted. \n \n4.  Balance Sheets and Cash Flow Statements \n \n26.  The  projections  are  based  on  the  historical  values  of  the  fixed  assets.  Accounts \nreceivable  is  assumed  to  be  equivalent  to  3  months  of  net  sales.  Accounts  payable  are \nassumed at 3 months of operating expenses, and inventory would be 33% of fuel and materials. \nPrevailing balances of other balance sheet accounts are maintained. \n \n27.

Economic Assumptions \n \n1.  The economic analysis of the Tianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power \nPlant Project was carried out in line with a standard cost\u2013benefit analysis framework and in \naccordance  with  Asian  Development  Bank  Guidelines  for  Economic  Analysis  of  Projects.1 \nEconomic costs and benefit are at 2009 constant prices and expressed in domestic currency. \nThe analysis was carried out over 25 years, in line with the project life assumed in the feasibility \nstudy approved by the National Development and Reform Commission. \n \nB.  Estimation of Costs \n \n2.  Tradable commodities were valued at border prices at the prevailing exchange rate. \nNon-tradable commodities were valued through shadow prices using a standard conversion \nfactor of 0.987, and the following specific conversion factors: 1.0 for equipment, 1.0 for skilled \nlabor, and 0.67 for unskilled labor. Capital costs were adjusted to eliminate price inflation, \ninterest during construction, and taxes. \n \nC.  Estimation of Benefits \n \n3.  The main economic benefit of the Project is from power generation to meet electricity \ndemand from end users. Expected consistent demand growth for electricity in Tianjin and the \nNorth China Power Grid, to which the Project will be connected, means the Project will meet \nnew demand rather than substitute for power from any existing generation capacity. Analysis \nused  conservative  estimates  of  the  actual  benefits.  Lower  forecast  for  generation,  and \nconservative  in-plant  use  and  marginal  transmission  and  distribution  loss  of  15.21%  of \ngenerated electricity, formed the basis for incremental net energy supply of 1,245 gigawatt-\nhours per year to end users. This represents a 56% load factor, or an average load of 142.1 \nmegawatts.  \n \n4.  Economic  benefit  was  calculated  using  a  semilog 2  electricity  demand  function. \nIncremental benefits were quantified based on end users' willingness to pay (WTP). Consumer \nsurplus\u2014the difference between what one is willing to pay for a commodity and the amount one \nis  actually  required  to  pay\u2014was  estimated  at  CNY0.752  per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh)  using  a \nsemilog function.  \n \n5.  There are positive environmental benefits from avoided pollution\u2014annual emissions of \n43 tons (t) of particulate matters, 1,237 t of sulfur dioxide, 3,325 t of nitrogen oxide\u2014from a \ntraditional  coal-fired  thermal  power  plant  as  the  alternative  energy  source.  Among  these \nenvironmental benefits, the most prominent ones are (i) improved human health from avoided \nmorbidity  and  mortality  from  fine  particulates,  (ii)  improved  human  welfare  from  improved \nvisibility and reduced damage to materials from avoided air pollution, and (iii) positive impacts \non environmental resources from avoided emission of carbon dioxide. For the evaluation of the \nenvironmental benefit to human health and welfare, the \"benefit transfer method\" suggested in \nADB\u2019s  Economic  Evaluation  of  Environmental  Impacts:  A  Workbook 3  is  used  for  this \nassessment,  and  these  benefits  were  included  in  the  estimation.  However,  complete \nquantification and estimation of all benefits from the Project were not possible for lack of time \nand resources, among other reasons. The total benefits in this analysis can thus be interpreted \nas conservative estimates.  \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1997.

To complement the deterministic analysis above, risk analysis was performed using a \nprobabilistic approach to the perceived risk factors that affect the viability of the Project. The \nselected risk variables included capital cost, energy sales, operating cost, foreign exchange \nrate, and WTP. Three thousand simulations were made. Based on the weighted average of all \nsimulated combinations, the expected EIRR of the Project is 15.58% with a standard deviation \nof 2.10%. This is only 0.90 percentage points lower than the base value.  \n \nF.  Conclusions  \n \n10.   The economic analysis confirms that the Project is sustainable. It was estimated that the \nProject has a net present economic value of CNY795.92 million. This quantification is based on \na WTP tariff of CNY0.752/kWh and an energy use of 1,245 gigawatt-hours by end users. The \nanalysis yields a base case EIRR of 16.49%. Sensitivity and risk analyses show that the EIRR is \nrobust.   ", "Appendix 14  55 \nSUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF \nENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT PLAN \n \nA.  Introduction  \n \n1.  The  proposed  Tianjin  Integrated  Gasification  Combined  Cycle  Power  Plant  Project \npromotes a new technology being developed and trialed in the People's Republic of China \n(PRC)  for  the  first  time.  Consequently,  following  environmental  impact  assessment  (EIA) \napproval  by  State  Environmental  Protection  Administration  in  July  2007,  it  has  undergone \nadditional rigorous scrutiny from the National Development and Reform Commission, which \napproved the Project's feasibility report only in May 2009. However, the approved feasibility \nreport is based on the same parameters of the Project upon which the EIA report was prepared. \nThis appendix provides the status of the project implementation and evaluates its environmental \ncompliance with the environmental management plan included in the EIA report. \n \nB.  Background  \n \n2.  The  Project  consists  of  developing  a  250  megawatt  (MW)  integrated  gasification \ncombined cycle (IGCC) power plant and a research center to further research polygeneration \noptions, especially to pilot test hydrogen production and fuel cell power generation. The project \nis  located  in  Tianjin  Harbor  Industrial  Park  in  Tanggu  district  of  Tianjin.  The  scope  of \nconstruction work includes \n(i)  a coal gasifier with a processing capacity of 2,000 tons per day (The coal gasifier \nused is a two-stage dry pulverized coal gasifier. The production process includes \ncoal  grinding  and  drying,  pulverized  coal  compression  and  feeding,  coal \ngasification,  slag  removal,  dust  removal,  wet  scrubbing,  ash-flushing  water \ntreatment, and wastewater treatment); \n(ii)  gas turbine and steam turbine combined cycle, consisting of one 171 MW gas \nturbine, one 110 MW steam turbine, and a waste heat boiler; \n(iii)  a  synthesis  gas  (syngas)  purification  system,  with  a  processing  capacity  of \n  160,739 newton cubic meter per hour (Nm3/h); \n(iv)  a sulfur recovery system (The Shell-Paques biological desulfurization process is \nused to remove hydrogen sulfide in the raw gas; its sulfur recovery capacity is \n8.27 tons per day); \n(v)  a flaring system (In case of operation failure, syngas can be flared; the torch is \n80 meters high and 900 millimeters in diameter); \n(vi)  other items including an air-separation facility with a capacity of 43,497 cubic \nmeters  per  hour,  water  supply,  power  supply,  an  ash-removal  system,  a \nwastewater-treatment and -discharge system, a water recycling system, a boiler \nwater supply system, and a fire water system; \n(vii)  a  storage  and  transport  system,  including  coal  transport,  a  storage  and \ndistribution system, an emergency ash yard, an on-site temporary solid waste \nyard, an oil tank, and an oil pump room; \n(viii)  temporary workers\u2019 accommodation; and \n(ix)  a permanent office and residential building.  \n \nC.  Project Implementation \n \n3.  Project construction was formally launched on 6 July 2009 with some pre-construction \nactivities.  The  project  implementing  agency,  Huaneng  Tianjin  IGCC  Co.  Ltd.  (HTICL),  has \ncommenced the selection of construction companies and equipment providers. Tianjin Power \n   ", " 56  Appendix 14 \nConstruction Co. has been selected to construct the foundation treatment facility, while the \nconstruction company for other civil works has yet to be finalized. Some foundation treatment \nactivities were carried out.  \n \n4.  As per the Project's EIA, HTICL has set up an environmental management unit (EMU) in \nits project division.  \n \n5.  A summary of environmental impacts and implementation of environmental management \nplan (EMP) is included in the Project. HTICL has sent the EIA report and EMP to all companies \nand organizations involved in the construction of the Project, requiring them to comply with the \nEMP through construction contracts. Meanwhile, each construction company is required to \nprepare a separate EMP for their construction site in accordance with the Project's EMP. The \nEMU and the contractors are responsible for implementing environmental mitigation. \n \n6.  The  institutional  arrangements  with  regard  to  environmental  management  and \nmonitoring are detailed in Figure A14. \n \n \nFigure A14: Environmental Management and Monitoring Structure \n \n \n    Tianjin EPB\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Tianjin Water Bureau \n  Tanggu EPB \n \n \n \n  Tanggu EPB\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  Environmental \n    Monitoring Station  Tianjin Soil Erosion \n    Control Station \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGreengenCo.\n    \nEP B   = Environmental Protection Bureau. \n  Source: Project Implementing Agency. \n \n7.  The Tianjin and Tanggu environmental protection bureaus (EPBs) are responsible for \nmonitoring air and water quality, noise, and solid waste in the project area through the Tanggu \nEnvironmental Monitoring Station. The Tianjin Water Bureau, through the Tianjin Soil Erosion \nControl Station, monitors water and soil loss. Site inspections are undertaken by the Tianjin and \nTanggu EPBs. Annual results are reported to the Tianjin EPB. \n \n \n \n \n ", "Appendix 14  57 \nD.  Environmental Monitoring Plan \n \n8.  According to the EIA, and as later determined through project site characteristics, the \nenvironmental monitoring program mainly includes the regular monitoring of air quality, noise \nimpact,  solid  waste,  and  soil  loss  at  the  project  site  during  construction.  The  monitoring \nfrequency of the parameters as proposed in the EIA changed following discussion with the \nExecuting  Agency.  In  the  PRC,  the  common  practice  among  power  plants  is  to  conduct \nenvironmental monitoring at the end of project construction, just before project acceptance. For \nthis Project, environmental monitoring is planned to be conducted biannually throughout the \nconstruction period (Table A14). \n \nTable A14: Summary of Monitoring Plan During Project Construction \nConstruction  Authority  Monitoring Parameter  Monitoring Frequency \nAir quality  Local EPB  TSP  Biannually \nNoise   Local EPB  decibels  Biannually \nDisposal of hazardous and \nSolid waste  Local EPB  Biannually \nnon-hazardous waste \nTianjing Soil loss \nSoil loss   Soil loss  Biannually \nControl Station \nEPB = environmental protection bureau, TSP = total suspended particles. \nSource: Environment impact assessment report, 2007. \n \n9.  Since the construction of main project components (coal gasification island and power \ngeneration  island,  etc.)  is  expected  to  pick  up  momentum  from  2010,  the  environmental \nmonitoring will be closely supervised with regular missions. The IGCC monitoring framework for \nits operational stage is identical to that recommended in the EIA document.  \n \nE.  Conclusion \n \n10.  During 2009, preparatory work for project construction was completed, and construction \nwas limited to small civil works with very minor environmental impact. Environmental mitigation \nmeasures such as tree planting, road pavement, and water spray, etc., were undertaken to \nminimize environmental impact. The EMU, EMP, and monitoring framework for construction \nhave been established to ensure the protection of the environment. There was no environmental \ninfringement  record  in  2009.  In  general,  project  construction,  in  2009,  strictly  followed  the \nrequirements  of  the  project  EIA  report.  Project  implementation  is  going  well  in  terms  of \nenvironmental safeguards. The Asian Development Bank will continue to monitor environmental \nsafeguards with regular missions. \n \n   ", " 58  Appendix 15 \nSUMMARY POVERTY REDUCTION AND SOCIAL STRATEGY \nCountry and Project Title: People\u2019s Republic of China: Tianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant  \n \nLending/Financing  Department/  East Asia Department / Energy \nProject Loan \nModality:  Division:  Division \n       \nI.  POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Link to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \nThe Tianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant Project is a 250 megawatt power plant to provide base-load \nelectric power generation to the local power grid. The Project will generate substantial positive environmental benefits by \nreducing air pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO ) when compared with replacement \n2\nconventional coal-fired power plants. The Project will have local, regional, and global benefits from avoided particulate matter, \nsulfur dioxide (SO ), nitrogen oxide, CO , and other air pollutants. The Project supports the People's Republic of China (PRC) \n2 2\n11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) 2006\u20132010, which emphasizes resource conservation and environmental protection and gives \npriority to improving energy efficiency and developing cleaner energy sources. The Project will support 11th FYP targets for (i) \nreducing SO  emissions by 10% by reducing coal consumption for power generation and (ii) improving energy efficiency by \n2\n20% through highly efficient, cutting-edge technology. The Project supports the goals of improving energy efficiency and \nresource utilization outlined in the China Medium- and Long-Term Energy Conservation Plan 2005 and the Decision of the \nState Council on Enhancing Energy Conservation (2006) No. 28, which emphasizes energy conservation, particularly in \npower generation. The proposed Project is consistent with the Asian Development Bank\u2019s Medium-Term Strategy II 2006\u2013\n2008 strategic priority of managing the environment, as well as the country strategy and program for the PRC strategic \ndevelopment objective of improving the environment.  \nB.

Introduction \n \n1.  The preparation of the Tianjin Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle Power Plant \nProject has been very different from that of other traditional loans on account of its late formal \ninclusion in the country assistance plan in 2009. It is a rare, if not the first, loan project without \nformal project preparatory technical assistance (TA) in the People's Republic of China (PRC). \nThe project team has adopted an innovative approach for tracking internal approvals in the PRC \nand its inclusion in the country program, as well as to address key issues in processing, as \ndetailed below.  \n \nB.  Innovative Project Processing Approach   \n \n2.  Project Preparatory Technical Assistance. Project preparatory TA accompanies loan \ninclusion in the country assistance pipeline. Small-scale TA for $200,000 was approved in 2008 \nto illustrate the strong interest of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in integrated gasification \ncombined  cycle  technology  and  provide  urgent  processing  momentum.  This  resulted  in \nsatisfactory preparation such that, soon after the Project's inclusion in the program, loan fact-\nfinding was completed in May 2009.   \n \n3.  Advanced Contracting. The Project was expected to have fast-track implementation \nupon feasibility report approval, the timing of which was unclear due to the demonstration nature \nof the Project. In view of delays in its inclusion in the country program and uncertainties about \nthe  timing  of  approval  of  the  feasibility  report,  ADB  management  approved  the  advanced \ncontracting in August 2008 to allow procurement to follow ADB's procurement guidelines and \nthus be eligible for ADB financing when the Project gets included in the pipeline.  \n \n4.  Onlending  Issues. The Project is implemented by a state-owned enterprise (SOE) \nwithout provincial government support. The ADB loan to a SOE without provincial government \nonlending created a big challenge as the Ministry of Finance is reluctant to onlend directly to an \nSOE without very strict counter guarantees. The introduction of the Export-Import Bank of China \n(EXIM Bank), a policy bank of the Government with expertise in similar onlending operations, \nhas resolved this issue.  \n \nC.
