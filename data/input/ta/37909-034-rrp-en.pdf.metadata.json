THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation of the President (RRP) \non proposed guarantees, loans, and (unfunded and funded) risk participation products of up to \n$800,000,000 for the additional financing of the Trade Finance Program (TFP), and support for: \n(i)  the incorporation on a permanent basis of the following changes in scope to the \nTFP, originally approved on a temporary basis as part of ADB\u2019s Comprehensive \nResponse to the COVID-19 Pandemic,1 to enable the TFP to: \n(a)  support domestic trade when an emergency is declared by a national \ngovernment or an officially recognized international body; \n(b)  support  transactions  involving  goods  in  projects that  are classified  as \ncategory B for the environment under Asian Development Bank\u2019s (ADBs) \nSafeguard Policy Statement (SPS) (2009) when the transaction is not \nconnected to an ADB financed project;2 and  \n(c)  use local currency for loans and guarantees issued under the program;3 \nand \n(ii)  providing the TFP  with the  ability to support  transactions involving  goods  in \nprojects that are: \n(a)  classified category B for involuntary resettlement impacts under the SPS \nwhen the transaction is not connected to an ADB financed project; and  \n(b)  classified category A for the environment or involuntary resettlement, or \nclassified Category A or B for indigenous peoples impacts under the SPS, \nif the transactions are to support goods and equipment for ADB-financed \nprojects for which ADB compliance is already confirmed.  \n \n2.  This RRP also fulfils the reporting requirement to the Board on the program\u2019s performance \nat intervals of no more than 3 years. \n \nII.  THE PROGRAM \nA.  Program Overview \n3.  Trade finance is explicitly recognized in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for \nDevelopment as important to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals \n(SDGs).4 However, an ADB survey published in September 2019 estimated a global trade finance \ngap of $1.5 trillion, with small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and women-led businesses \nbeing the most underserved.5 This gap has widened during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) \npandemic. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) anticipates that an additional $1.9 \ntrillion\u2013$5 trillion is required to support a rapid global recovery.6 \n \n4.  ADB\u2019s TFP reduces market gaps for trade finance by (i) providing guarantees and loans \nto banks, and undertaking funded and unfunded risk participation, in support of trade; and \n(ii) delivering knowledge products, services and solutions. The program was established in 2003 \n \n1  ADB. 2020. ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Manila. \n2  ADB. 2009. Safeguard Policy Statement. June.

In 2009, following the global financial crisis, the ADB Board of Directors \nendorsed an expansion of the program limit to $1 billion.7 In 2012, the Board endorsed a major \nchange in the program that removed the sunset clause and introduced a maximum 3-year \nreporting requirement.8 In 2018, the Board endorsed an expansion of the program limit to $1.35 \nbillion.9 In April 2020, under ADB\u2019s Comprehensive Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the \nADB Board of Directors approved scope changes and a program limit increase of $800 million, \nwhich raised the limit to $2.15 billion (footnote 1). In order to meet increased demand, this paper \nproposes to mainstream the policy variations and $800 million limit increase approved under \nADB\u2019s COVID-19 Response, which are currently set to expire on 30 July 2021. \n \nB.  Business Overview from 2018\u20132020 \n5.  Design and monitoring framework results. The program exceeds the core indicator \ntargets set forth in the design and monitoring framework (covering 2018\u20132020) appended to the \nprogram\u2019s 2018 RRP (footnote 8), and is on track to achieve development goals.  \n \nDesign and Monitoring Framework Targets versus Results, 2018\u20132020 \nMetric  Target  Result \nValue of trade supported (million)  $12,820  $17,435 \nCofinancing (million)  $8,013  $10,205 \nNumber of transactions  8,814  16,486 \nNumber of transactions involving SMEs  6,925  9,658 \nNumber of intraregional transactions  7,043  12,744 \nNumber of DMC-to-DMC transactions  1,798  4,620 \nDMC = developing member country, SMEs = small and medium-sized enterprises.  \nSource: Asian Development Bank (Trade Finance Program). \n \n6.  The TFP had a 50% increase in the number of transactions (to 7,178) and a 7% increase \nin transaction value (to $5.8 billion) in 2020 compared with 2019. The current program limit of \n$2.15 billion was never breached. This was possible because of the short-term nature of trade \nfinance. The average life, or tenor, of the underlying transactions was 152 days in 2020, which \nmeant each dollar of the limit could be used twice in a year. The TFP also employs a co-financing \nstrategy, transferring portions of risk to mostly private insurers, beyond ADB\u2019s internal limit \nthreshold.10 The  TFP  executes  transactions  daily, mostly  within  24  hours. It  is  an  intense \noperating environment that has remained uninterrupted despite the pandemic. Achieving a 50% \nincrease in transaction volume was difficult but well managed under the work-from-home COVID-\n19-related restrictions. \n \n7.  The Trade Finance Program\u2019s COVID-19 response. The TFP\u2019s increased support \nduring the pandemic, through both transactions and knowledge products, has helped commercial \nlenders continue to finance trade in developing member countries (DMCs) as the global economy \nexperienced major  shocks.  The  TFP  has  been highly  visible  in  the  market, with  ADB \nstaff providing webinars on COVID-19-related risk to trade finance, and how it can be mitigated. \nAs part of  these  efforts,  the  TFP,  in  coordination  with  other  ADB  departments,  created  a \nknowledge  product\u2014a  tool that maps the  entire supply chain  for  34  COVID-19 emergency \nresponse goods such as masks, ventilators, and vaccines, including companies involved in each \n \n7  ADB. 2009.

This initiative facilitates the process of identifying and \naddressing bottlenecks impeding the ramp-up of supplies for critical goods.11 The program\u2019s \nefforts were recognized through industry awards in 2020, including Global Finance Magazine\u2019s \n\u201cOutstanding Crisis Leadership\u201d and \u2018Best Trade Finance MDB Award\u2019 from Trade Finance \nGlobal.  \n \n8.  Utilization. During 2018\u20132020, the program supported 16,486 transactions valued at \n$17.4 billion. The TFP\u2019s gross peak utilization on a single day in 2020 was $2.2 billion compared \nwith $1.6 billion in 2019. To manage its pipeline of transactions and comply with the approved \nprogram limit of $2.15 billion, ADB distributed $1.68 billion in exposure to eligible counterparties.12 \n \n9.  Sector  composition.  During  2018\u20132020,  the  program  supported  a  broad  array  of \ntransactions, including small transactions, such as a $24,000 export of taro and coconuts from \nSamoa to New Zealand, and large transactions, such as a $15 million import of textile machinery \nto Pakistan from Japan.  \n \n10.  In  2020,  in  terms  of  the  number  of  transactions,  the  portfolio  included  non-\nenergy commodities (43%), food and agricultural (20%), capital goods (10%), and medical and \npharmaceutical goods (4%). The number of medical and pharmaceutical transactions increased \nby more than 150% in 2020 and by 41% in United States dollar terms. While the number of oil \n(2%) and gas (1%) transactions in the TFP\u2019s portfolio is low, the dollar value as a percentage of \nthe overall portfolio was 23% for oil and 15% for gas.  \n  \n11.  Oil and gas imports are a lifeline for many DMC economies. Over 85% of oil imports \nsupported by the program are to Pakistan and Sri Lanka, with 15% to Bangladesh and Viet Nam. \nThese DMCs rely heavily on oil and gas imports for transport and industrial sectors. The Pakistan \ncountry partnership strategy, 2021-2025, calls for stable import of oil under strategic pillar 1 of \nimproving  economic  management:  lifting  growth,  building  resilience,  increasing \ncompetitiveness.13 Large oil shipments are a challenge for the private sector in these DMCs due \nto the size of such transactions (typically $25 million to $50 million) against insufficient country \nand counterparty limits, due to weak country credit ratings and/or weak counterparty ratings on \nDMC banks in these markets.14 \n \n12.  ADB is currently discussing full alignment with the Paris Agreement by 2023.15 The \nmultilateral development bank (MDB) climate coordination group is developing the methodology \nto assess compliance with the Paris Agreement, which will consider trade finance support for oil \nusing a shared MDB approach. While the TFP support for oil imports at this point in time is \nimportant, the ultimate goal is to stop supporting oil. Therefore, the TFP will support oil shipments \nonly and will not support any greenfield oil projects, new exploration sites, and refineries. The TFP \nwill implement a \u201cGreen Initiative\u201d to encourage sustainable transactions based on longer tenors \nof up to 3 years, which will be made available to support capital equipment for sustainable \nprojects. The TFP will review its support for oil shipments as part of its next report to the Board in \n \n11 ADB. 2020.

In  the  interim,  the  program  will  engage  with  the  MDB  climate  coordination  group\u2019s \ndeliberations on support for oil shipments against Paris Agreement Alignment. Progress with \nrespect to green technology, affordability, and DMC\u2019s Nationally Determined Contributions will be \ntaken into account. Collectively, these steps would ensure that the TFP\u2019s support for oil imports \nremains aligned with SDGs and the Paris Agreement. \n \n13.  Geographic distribution. Of the program\u2019s 22 countries of operation, the 4 most active \nwere Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam, both by number of transactions (93% of \nportfolio) and dollar value (95% of portfolio). Because of the size of their economies and market \ndemand, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Viet Nam have consistently been among the \nTFP\u2019s top four most active markets. Uzbekistan\u2019s share of the portfolio has been increasing as \nthe economy liberalizes and demand for TFP guarantees increases. During 2018\u20132020, more \nthan 61% of program transactions were conducted in Asian Development Fund countries.16 The \nprogram supported 12,744 intraregional transactions and 4,620 transactions between DMCs over \nthe 3-year reporting period. \n \n14.  Small and medium-sized enterprises. The program continues to play a vital role in \nproviding  access  to trade  finance for  SMEs.  In  2018\u22122020,  an  estimated  81%  of  program \ntransactions supported SMEs, with 7,544 SME transactions supported.17 \n \nC.  Knowledge Products \n15.  Trade  Finance  Gaps,  Growth  and  Jobs  survey.  Knowledge  Products  form  an \nintegral part of  the Trade Finance Program  and  drive  future  business  volumes.  This \nknowledge product (footnote 4), developed in partnership with Economic Research and Regional \nCooperation  Department  (ERCD), continues to  receive  global  attention  as  the  world\u2019s  first \nstatistics that quantify market gaps for trade finance and their impact on economic growth and job \ncreation. The most recent study was launched in September 2019. The TFP and ERCD will \nrelease an updated study on market gaps in September 2021. \n \n16.  Anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism initiatives. The \nTrade Finance Gaps Growth and Jobs survey (footnote 4) attributed unintended consequences \nof anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) as important \ncontributors to market gaps. To address such gaps, the TFP engaged multiple stakeholders to \ndevelop knowledge products, services, and solutions. In addition to closing market gaps, the \nprogram\u2019s AML/CFT initiatives seek to increase transparency and improve methods on a global \nindustry level to identify and prevent trade-based crime in the global financial system. In 2020, \nthe Financial Action Task Force (FATF) report on Trade-Based Money Laundering cited TFP\u2019s \nAML initiatives as a best practice. There is an ongoing collaboration with the United Nations Office \non Drugs and Crime\u2019s goAML team to improve suspicious transaction reporting in trade. \n \n17.  Capacity building initiatives. The program implemented a successful online training \nprogram focused on trade finance, AML, and sustainability. The program is also promoting \ntraining to fight modern slavery and illegal trade in wildlife. Over 700 individuals from 20 DMCs \ntook part in these online courses.  \n \n16 Calculated based on the classification, under ADB\u2019s Classification and Graduation Policy, of Sri Lanka and Viet Nam \nas Group B (OCR Blend) in 2018 and as Group C (Regular OCR only) in 2019 and 2020. If the 2019 classification is \napplied to TFP 2018\u20132020 results, the figure is 46%.  \n17 In 2018 and 2019, transactions valued at less than $1 million were considered to have supported SMEs. In 2020, the \ncalculation of the number of SME transactions supported was revised using a new methodology aligned with the \nInternational Finance Corporations\u2019 criteria of SMEs, i.e., turnover \u2264 $15 million and/or 300 or fewer employees. \n \nINTERNAL.

The TFP is leading industry efforts through the ICC to create \ncommonly  approved  definitions  for sustainable  trade  finance  and  to  explore  links between \nsustainability  and  regulatory capital treatment  for  banks  to  make  sustainable trade  finance \ntransactions systemically less expensive.  \n \n19.  Gender initiative. The program\u2019s gender initiative assessed the human resource policies \nof 19 partner banks from 8 countries to identify enhancements to attract, retain, and promote \nwomen  in  banking;  12  banks  implemented  25  recommendations.18 The  initiative  is  being \nexpanded to include more banks in more countries and to enhance support for implementing more \ncomplex recommendations, such as grievance procedures.19 \n \n20.  Digitalization of trade. Digitalization is critical to making global trade and supply chains \nless susceptible to shocks, as experienced during the pandemic. The TFP, in partnership with the \nGovernment of Singapore and the ICC, established the Digital Standards Initiative in the second \nhalf of 2020; the DSI is coordinating disparate efforts to develop digital standards and protocols \nto drive inter-operability between component parts of the trade ecosystem, which will underpin \nprogress in fintech to reduce financing gaps among SMEs and DMCs. TFP will use One ADB \napproaches to close legislative gaps impeding digitalization of trade.  \n \n21.  Audit.  The  Office  of  Auditor  General  audited  the  program  in  2020.  The  audit \nrecommended improvement in controls and efficiency within the TFP\u2019s management system and \nstated that the Trade Finance Unit has adequate manual controls in place to compensate for the \nsystem\u2019s shortcomings.20 Operational risk is heightened due to weaknesses in the program\u2019s \ninformation technology system, which is incapable of supporting a business of this size and scale. \nADB is in the process of replacing the TFP management system with a more robust system; this \nis targeted for implementation by the end of 2023. \n  \n22.  Revenue and profitability. The program has never had a default or loss.  \n \nD.  Lessons Learned \n23.  Increased program limit. Following approval of the special policy variation under the \nCOVID-19 Response Paper (footnote 1), the entire $800 million in additional TFP limits is being \nused and has enhanced the program\u2019s ability to address access to trade finance. It is expected \nthat there will be heightened demand for TFP\u2019s products for the medium-term. First quarter 2021 \nresults indicate a 37% increase in transaction value and a 1% decline in transaction numbers over \n2020 for the same period. \n \n24.  Crisis response. As an excellent crisis response vehicle, the TFP could be used as an \neffective tool to support domestic trade when an emergency is declared by a national government \nor an officially recognized international body.  \n \n25.  Category B transactions. There is demand for capital and other equipment transactions \nin projects that are classified as Category B under ADB\u2019s SPS (footnote 2).

Mainstreaming of support for local currency transactions. Over 90% of international \ntrade finance is in hard currencies (mostly United States dollars), but there are circumstances, \nparticularly in trade between DMCs, when clients could benefit from support in local currencies. \n \nIII.  THE PROPOSED ADB ASSISTANCE \nA.  The Assistance \n27.  Additional financing. Because the additional $800 million program limit approved on a \ntemporary basis in the COVID-19 Response is being fully used (para. 23), with continued high \nmarket demand for the TFP as demonstrated in first quarter 2021 results, it is proposed to make \npermanent the $800 million as part of the existing $2.15 billion program limit. Except as set out in \nparas. 28\u221229, it is proposed that the program, as previously approved, remain unchanged. \n \n28.  Scope Changes. It is proposed to make permanent the following, which was approved \non a temporary basis in the COVID-19 Response: \n(i)  the ability for the TFP to support domestic trade when an emergency is declared \nby a national government or an officially recognized international body;21 \n(ii)  the ability for the TFP to support transactions involving goods in projects that are \nclassified category B for the environment in accordance with ADB\u2019s SPS (footnote \n2) when the transaction is not connected to an ADB financed project;22 and \n(iii)  the ability for the TFP to use local currency for loans and guarantees issued under \nthe program  \n \n29.  Expanded eligible safeguards categorization. It is also proposed for TFP to support \ntransactions  involving  goods  in  projects  that  are  classified  (i)  category  B  for  involuntary \nresettlement when the transaction is not connected to an ADB financed project; (ii) category A for \nthe environment or involuntary resettlement /or category A or B for indigenous peoples impacts if \nthe transactions are to support goods and equipment for ADB-financed projects, for which ADB \ncompliance is confirmed.  \n \nB.  Implementation Arrangements \n30.  No changes are proposed to existing implementation arrangements.23 \n \n31.  Reporting  arrangements.  In  accordance  with  the  2012  major  change  in  program \n(footnote 8), ADB reports on the TFP to the Board at intervals of no more than 3 years and will \nreport to the Board next in 2024. \n \n \n21 TFP support for domestic trade is further discussed in Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from \nlinked documents 2 in Appendix 2). As set out in the Details of Implementation Arrangements, the TFP\u2019s Revolving \nCredit Facility product will be the implementation vehicle. \n22 Safeguards categorization of transactions eligible for TFP support is further discussed in Details of Implementation \nArrangements, Summary Poverty Reduction and Social Strategy, and Environmental and Social Management \nSystem Arrangements (accessible from linked documents 2, 4, and 5 in Appendix 2). \n23 TFP\u2019s integrity due diligence is further addressed in Details of Implementation Arrangements (accessible from linked \ndocument 2 in Appendix 2).  \n \nINTERNAL.

Increased access to trade finance. Approving the additional $800 million program limit \non a permanent basis will increase the program\u2019s ability to meet market demand and catalyze \ncofinancing. The TFP is ADB\u2019s largest mobilizer of short-term co-financing.  As such, ADB can \nhelp  strengthen  banking  systems  and  reduce  trade  finance  gaps,  which  will  contribute  to \neconomic growth that drives job creation and, ultimately, a reduction in poverty.  \n \n33.  Support  for  domestic  trade  during  emergencies.  The  TFP\u2019s  existing  network  of \nhundreds of partner banks worldwide makes the TFP a platform through which ADB can channel \nimmediate support through local banking systems and mobilize co-financing with global banks \nand  eligible  counterparties.  Mainstreaming  the  program\u2019s  ability  to  support  domestic \ntransactions\u2014in addition to its long-standing ability to support cross-border trade\u2014could prove \nan effective additional crisis response tool for DMCs in future emergencies. \n  \n34.  Access to local currency loans and guarantees. The ability to support local currency \ntransactions will increase the TFP\u2019s capacity to support a reduction in DMC reliance on hard \ncurrencies, and adds to the options ADB has to support DMCs facing local currency market \nshocks. In this way, the TFP could further play an important role in supporting DMCs in line with \nits capability as a crisis response tool. \n  \n35.  Strengthening safeguards and increasing access to finance for capital equipment. \nExpanding safeguards eligibility to include transactions classified category B for environment or \ninvoluntary resettlement impacts will provide the TFP with the capability to support DMCs in an \nimportant area, e.g., with respect to core plant equipment, and materials needed for new and/or \nupgraded infrastructure projects. The ability to support these transactions offers the opportunity \nfor partner banks to strengthen their ESMSs and practices through technical assistance provided \nby the TFP. The TFP support for transactions involving goods for ADB-financed projects that are \nclassified category A for the environment or involuntary resettlement impacts, or category A or B \nfor indigenous peoples impacts, could fill trade finance gaps for such projects, while taking \nadvantage of assessments made in projects already supported by ADB through project finance, \nfor which the supply of materials and equipment can be supported under the TFP while  mitigating \nand managing potential reputational and compliance risks.24 \n \n36.  Gender  equality  enhanced.  The  TFP  will  expand  its  gender  initiative,  which  has \nassessed the human resource policies of banks to identify enhancements to attract, retain and \npromote more women in banking.25 \n \nD.  Risks \n \n37.  Low-risk nature of trade finance. The program has never had a default or loss. In 2010, \nthe program mobilized the private sector to create the first default and loss statistics for trade \nfinance on a global industry basis. These data are published annually by the ICC and indicate \n \n24 Safeguards categorization of transactions eligible for TFP support is discussed in Summary Poverty Reduction and \nSocial  Strategy  and Environmental  and Social  Management System Arrangements  (accessible  from  linked \ndocuments 4 and 5 in Appendix 2). \n25 The gender initiative is further addressed in the Gender Action Plan (accessible from linked document 6 in Appendix \n2). \n \nINTERNAL.

", "8 \ndefault rates for trade finance of 0.02%\u20130.05%.26 Trade finance carries relatively low risk because \nit tends to be short-term, self-liquidating, and has a high payment priority.   \n \n38.  Category B transactions. TFP aims to do more transactions with tenors of 1 to 3 years in \nsupport  of  Category B  and  green  initiative transactions,  which  will  entail  higher credit  and \nenvironmental risk; 1 to 3-year transactions are in line with Office of Risk Management\u2019s approved \nlimit parameters. Notwithstanding, the average tenor of TFP\u2019s portfolio will remain less than 180 \ndays.  \n \n39.  Country concentration risk. The program complies with ADB\u2019s country exposure limits \nfor nonsovereign operations, but the predominance of program transactions in certain countries \ncould lead to exposure concentration. \n \n40.  Risk of passive breach in risk transfers. The program has actively distributed risk to \neligible counterparties. A rapid deterioration in the credit ratings of a counterparty could, in \nextreme situations, lead to a passive breach of obligor or program limits. However, this risk is \nmanaged by diversification to eligible counterparties. Further, should a counterparty\u2019s rating \ndeteriorate  below  agreed  thresholds,  ADB  has  the  right  to  terminate  the  risk  distribution \nagreement with the counterparty. \n  \nIV.  DEVELOPMENT IMPACT AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT \nA.  Development Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n41.  Impact.  Strengthen  the capacity  of  domestic financial  institutions  to  encourage  and \nexpand access to banking, insurance, and financial services for all. This will be achieved by \nincreasing access of DMC banks to trade finance through the program. \n \n42.  Outcome.  Support  for  trade  finance  in  Asia  and  the  Pacific  expanded.  Through  a \ncombination of guarantees, loans, and unfunded and funded risk participations, as well as risk \ntransfers or risk distributions, DMC banks and their importer and exporter clients will have access \nto more trade finance, thereby closing market gaps. International banks can leverage ADB\u2019s \nsupport, in turn, to broaden their own support for trade in developing Asia. Success in achieving \nthe outcome will be measured in terms of an increase in the number of SMEs, intraregional and \nDMC-to-DMC trade transactions supported, and co-financing mobilized. \n \n43.  Outputs. Outputs include capacity to provide trade finance by the program\u2019s partner \nbanks enhanced in a gender-inclusive manner, and the expanded provision of trade finance \nsustained; these will be measured by the number of training sessions and seminars conducted \nduring 2021\u20132023, by the increase in the percentage of women participating in the TFP\u2019s training, \nand by the increase in banks participating in the program. In addition, the gender inclusiveness \nof participating banks\u2019 human resource policies will be enhanced, as measured by the number of \nbanks adopting measures to increase the hiring, retention, and advancement of women in the \nworkplace. In addition, the access to international trade finance of women-owned businesses will \nbe enhanced, and the environmental and social safeguards awareness of the TFP and its partner \nbanks will be increased.27  \n \n \n26 International Chamber of Commerce. 2020.

Consistency  with  ADB  strategy  and  country  strategy.  The  program  addresses \nremaining poverty and reducing inequalities (OP1 and SDG 1) by providing greater access to \ntrade finance among SMEs (SDG 8). The program delivers greater gender equality (OP 2 and \nSDG 5) by supporting more women in banking. It will contribute to tackling climate change and \nboosting environmental sustainability by promoting sustainable practices among banks. The TFP \nis committed to strengthening governance and institutional capacity (OP 6) and it delivers training \nfor banks, covering AML measures as well as promotion of environmental and social safeguards \nand standards for digitalization of trade (SDG 9). The program promotes intra-regional and \nbilateral trade  between  DMCs  (OP  7  and SDG  17).  Since  2009, it  has supported  25,398 \ntransactions (76.8% of all transactions supported) that involve intra- regional trade and supported \n8,429 transactions (25.4%) involving trade between DMCs. \n \nV.  POLICY COMPLIANCE \nA.  Safeguards and Social Dimensions \n45.  The program is classified FI for environment and involuntary resettlement, and FI treated \nas C for indigenous peoples in accordance with the ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement. Pursuant \nto the expanded eligible safeguards categorization, the program intends to support the trade of \ncommodities, goods, or services that in nature are of lower risk (Category C) for environment, \ninvoluntary resettlement, and indigenous people. The program will also expand its support to \nprojects that may be classified category B for environment or involuntary resettlement. For these \ncategory B transactions, partner banks will be required to have ADB-endorsed ESMSs and \ndemonstrated capacity to implement these prior to using ADB support on any category B project. \nIn addition, on occasions and by exception only, ADB support can be used for transactions that \nare Category A for environment or involuntary resettlement and A or B for indigenous peoples \nimpacts if the transactions are to support goods and equipment for ADB financed projects, and \nfor which ADB compliance is already confirmed. \n \n46.  Effective gender mainstreaming. Key features of the gender action plan are as follows: \n(i) significant women\u2019s participation in training and seminars, (ii) human resource policies of \nparticipating banks enhanced, (iii) training and networking sessions for women-owned businesses \nfocused on increasing their access to trade finance, and (iv) development of training for banks \nfocused on improving the bank\u2019s customer service for female clientele. The TFP will submit \nperiodic reports on the implementation of the gender measures. \n \n47.  There are no outstanding non-compliance issues with existing safeguards and social \nrequirements implementation under the program.28 \n \nB.  Anticorruption Policy \n48.
