A  capacity-building  technical  assistance  (TA)  project  for  ministries  involved  in \ninfrastructure was included in the Asian Development Bank (ADB) country strategy and program \nupdate (CSPU) 2003\u20132004 and CSPU 2004\u20132005 for Timor-Leste.1 A TA fact-finding mission \nvisited Dili during 2\u201310 March 2005 to conduct an initial needs assessment. In line with the \ndiscussions  held  with  the  Government  and  availability  of  resources,  the  mission  identified \nissues, rationale, scope, implementation schedule and arrangements, financing plan, and terms \nof reference of consultants for the TA. Members of the mission discussed the draft TA paper \nwith the Government, and concurrence has been obtained from the Office of the Prime Minister \n(OPM). \n2.  ADB has led infrastructure support in Timor-Leste since 2000. This work has focused on \nurgent rehabilitation of roads, ports, water supply, and rural power supply, bringing tangible \nbenefits  to  the  country.  However,  infrastructure  development  and  service  delivery  remain \ninadequate; therefore, ADB\u2019s continued leadership and support are necessary to achieve broad-\nbased and long-lasting economic and social benefits through improved infrastructure. Critical \nneeds are to (i) make more cohesive and efficient institutional arrangements and (ii) build \ntechnical capacity from a very low base.  \n3.  The CSPU 2005\u20132006 identified infrastructure development as the major area for ADB \nassistance, and capacity development as being central to all activities. The TA will address the \noverall institutional framework affecting the four infrastructure sectors: communications, power, \nwater supply and sanitation, and transport. The TA will also detail a capacity development \nprogram for the road sector and will deliver immediate road sector technical support. The design \nand monitoring framework of the TA is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Poverty in Timor-Leste: Timor-Leste is a newly independent country, with a population \nof 925,000 and a territory of 14,874 square kilometers. It is one of the most underdeveloped \neconomies in the region, with per capita gross domestic product (GDP) estimated at about $415 \nin 2003. About 40% of the population lives below the poverty line, which is defined as $0.55 per \ncapita per day. More than 75% of the poor live in rural areas and survive on subsistence and \nseasonal agriculture. Adult literacy is estimated at slightly over 40%. Life expectancy at birth is \nonly 58 years.  \n5.  National development planning: Following restoration of independence on 20 May \n2002,  Timor-Leste  began  nation  building.  The  National  Development  Plan  sets  out  the \nGovernment\u2019s development objectives and strategy. It focuses on two overriding development \ngoals: (i) to reduce poverty in all sectors and regions of the nation and (ii) to promote economic \ngrowth that is equitable and sustainable, improving the health, education, and well-being of \neveryone.  The  Road  Map  (a  medium-term  expenditure  framework)  stresses  strengthening \ngovernance,  developing  a  dynamic  private  sector,  and  building  institutions  and  capacity. \nAlthough  progress  has  been  made,  significant  challenges  lie  ahead,  the  greatest  being \nstrengthening growth prospects, creating employment opportunities, and reducing widespread \npoverty. \n___________________ \n1  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities (Internet edition) on 12 April 2005. \n ", "2   \n6.  Sector  investment  programs:  The  Government  recognizes  that  infrastructure  is \nimportant to all sectors of the economy and society. Its National Development Plan states that \n\u201can effective system of infrastructure and services is crucial for agricultural productivity and \npoverty reduction, a determinant of business investment, instrumental to human development, \nand the foundation for private sector development,\u201d and that there is a need \u201cto plan for, provide \nand manage physical infrastructure that is efficient, cost-effective, and financially sustainable, \nand which supports the social and economic development priorities of the people of Timor-\nLeste.\u201d Infrastructure capital and recurrent public expenditure will be guided by approved sector \ninvestment programs (prepared with ADB support) for communications, power, water supply \nand sanitation,  and transport.  Whereas these programs  address each infrastructure sector \nindividually,  there  has  been  little  analysis  and  policy  work  on  the  overall  institutional \nenvironment for infrastructure services.   \n7.  Infrastructure  institutional  framework:  As  in  most  countries,  the  infrastructure \ninstitutional framework in Timor-Leste has two parts. One part comprises government functions, \nsuch as strategic planning, legislating, regulating, controlling special projects, and providing \nsocial services in the absence of market supply. The second part comprises the business of \nmanaging assets and providing services in a market. These businesses are typically urban \nmonopolies and need not be run by the Government although Government may own the assets. \nBut  how  well  the  Government  arranges  and  does  its  strategic  planning,  legislating,  and \nregulating will greatly impact business performance and service delivery in urban markets. How \nwell the Government arranges and helps deliver services in rural areas will greatly affect living \nconditions outside of the urban monopolies. \n8.  Multisector  approach  for  government  functions:  External  assistance  from  key \npartners, including the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), the World Bank, the \nAustralian  Agency  for  International  Development  (AusAID),  and  the  Norwegian  Agency  for \nDevelopment Cooperation (NORAD) has been sector-specific and with some inconsistency and \noverlap. Strategic planning, legislating, and regulating have been sector by sector. So, for \ninstance,  natural  synergies  that  exist  between  income-generating  services,  such  as  power \nsupply and water supply, have been little analyzed and never exploited; likewise, multsector \napproaches to delivering services in rural areas. In a small market like Timor-Leste, there may \nalso  be  good  reasons  for  combining  legal  and  regulatory  functions  for  urban  monopolies, \nincluding airports and ports.  \n9.  Multisector approach for urban monopolies: A multisector approach is also relevant  \nto the asset management and service delivery part of the infrastructure institutional framework.  \nUrban monopolies can have common customer bases, similar revenue-generating and financial \nsustainability imperatives, and similar management system requirements, especially telecom, \npower  supply,  and  water  supply,  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  airports  and  ports.  Common \nprocurement, common infrastructure management systems, and common contract management \ncapabilities may be appropriate in Timor-Leste\u2019s small market. The asset management policy for \neach sector should consider merger and other synergy opportunities with other infrastructure \nservices. Currently, (i) telecommunications is already privatized through a build-operate-transfer \ncontract, (ii) airports and ports are recovering most costs and could become public corporations \nin the medium-term, (iii) electricity in Dili is under a management contract and is recovering \nmost costs, (iv) water supply and sanitation is far from cost recovery and independence, and (v) \nroads  have  possible  outsourcing  potential.  Although  the  progression  from  Government \ndepartment to corporatized asset manager and service provider is partway determined, it is still \nhaphazard  and  follows  no  clear  plan  that  will  maximize  aggregate  benefits  across  all \ninfrastructure sectors. \n ", "  3\n10.  Controlling capital works programs: Government ministries struggle to implement \ncapital works programs efficiently, and this adds to the hitherto intractable problem of budget \nexecution. Meanwhile, the Government intends tripling its own infrastructure capital spending \nfrom 2006 to 2008. Mechanisms are urgently needed to help the Government supervise and \noversee  publicly  funded  infrastructure  capital  expenditure  programs  that  would  mostly  be \nexecuted by private engineering companies and contractors. The Government also lacks the \ncapacity to manage large or otherwise special capital projects.  \n11.  Government reorganization: The Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Public \nWorks will soon be broken up, with functions going to three new ministries. All road-related \nfunctions will go to a new Ministry of Public Works, which will also handle urban development \nand  housing.  All  water-  and  power-related  functions  will  go  to  a  new  Ministry  of  Natural \nResources, Minerals, and Energy Policy. All communications and non-road transport functions \nwill be handled by a new Ministry of Transport and Communications. There will be a Secretary \nof State for Infrastructure Development, reporting directly to the Prime Minister.  \n12.  Vision  and  road  map  for  infrastructure  institutions  and  capacity:  Efficient  and \neffective infrastructure development and service delivery require a clear medium-term vision for \nthe  entire  infrastructure  institutional  framework\u2014for  government  functions  and  for  urban \nmonopolies. With an agreed vision for the future, the Government can then prepare and follow a \nstep-by-step road map to fill existing gaps. The vision and road map should holistically cover all \ninfrastructure sectors and budgets. Detailed capacity development plans for each infrastructure \nsector can then guide government and donor-assisted programs.  \n13.  Road sector. Timor-Leste has an extensive road network of 6,040 kilometers, which is \ngenerally in poor condition, and is deteriorating. The Government will incur considerable cost to \nrehabilitate and maintain such an extensive road network. Difficult terrain, geology, and weather \nconditions impose additional costs. The Government has outlined a 3-year program and a 10-\nyear  vision  for  the  road  system  to  (i) bring  the  road  network  to  a  sustainable  condition, \n(ii) improve key roads to support a growing economy, and (iii) ensure effective capacity to \nmanage the road system. Since 2000, ADB has administered two emergency rehabilitation \nprojects financed by the Trust Fund for Timor-Leste. All of the subprojects except one have \nbeen substantially completed. ADB intends to maintain its leading position in the road sector \nand is currently processing an Asian Development Fund IX grant project for $10 million. ADB\u2019s \nefforts, however, are being hampered by weak technical capacity in the sector. Project design, \nprocurement, construction supervision, quality control, and contract management cannot be \nadequately handled by the country and have to be left to consultants. This partially accounted \nfor start-up delays in projects already financed by the Trust Fund for Timor-Leste. To improve \nthe performance of the sector and help implement road projects, an urgent training program has \nto be introduced to build domestic engineering capacity.  \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The  TA  will  help  improve  the  delivery  of  infrastructure  services,  particularly  power \nsupply, water supply and sanitation, and road transport, and, to a lesser extent, airport and port \nservices, telecommunications, and other public works. The TA will result in more integrated \nmultisector  strategic  plans,  laws,  regulations,  capital  programs,  and  service  delivery \narrangements for rural areas, and more integrated urban infrastructure operations. Additionally, \n ", "4   \nfor  the  road  sector,  the  TA  will  aid  capacity  development  and  improve  road  engineering \ncapacity. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n15.  The TA comprises two components: (i) integrated multisector institutional development \nfor  infrastructure  and  (ii)  technical  capacity  building  for  the  road  sector.  An  experienced \ninternational consulting firm will be engaged to carry out the two components. For the first \ncomponent, the consultants provided by the firm must be highly qualified specialists in each \nsector  and  must  have  experience  in  multisector  infrastructure  institutional  development, \nincluding merging and harmonizing the operations of public infrastructure corporations and \nagencies. One of the consultants will act as the team leader, responsible for coordinating with \nthe Government and ADB, directing and coordinating the work of the sector specialists, and \nconsolidating progress reports and final reports. Also for the first component, the firm will \nprovide  consultants  experienced  in  designing  and  delivering  comprehensive  capacity \ndevelopment programs for the road sector.  \n16.  For the second component, a separate team of consultants with relevant experience in \nroad  upgrading,  rehabilitation  and  maintenance,  construction  supervision,  and  contract \nmanagement, as well as training in those areas, will be engaged to plan, organize, and carry out \nthe training. The consultants will be provided by the same firm and headed by a different team \nleader. \n17.  Identifying  appropriate  candidates  and  developing  suitable  training  materials  will  be \ncrucial to the success of the program. The TA will target 60 trainees to be trained in two \nsessions over 3 years. The first training session will take place before August 2006 and the \nsecond,  August  2007.  The  rationale  behind  the  1-year  interval  between  the  two  training \nsessions is that the quality and impact of the training needs to be reviewed and that lessons and \nexperiences need to be incorporated into the training materials and programs for the next \ntraining session. For each session, a 3-month intermittent classroom and on-the-job training \nprogram will be provided to 30 trainees. Since the Government has limited staff with a technical \nbackground,  and  some  of  them  may  not  be  available  for  training  due  to  their  other \ncommitments, it is necessary to go beyond the government system and look for candidates in \nthe market. In principle, 15 candidates will be from the Government, and 15 from the private \nsector for each session. Candidates should be Timorese nationals and have minimum English-\nlanguage and computer skills and technical qualifications. The list of candidates will be identified \nby the Government and agreed upon with ADB. \n18.  Various training materials already exist. The consultants will adapt them to the local \ncontext and ensure that they are user-friendly and straightforward, attending to the immediate \nneeds of the road sector. After the first session, the consultants will review the performance of \nthe trainees and adjust the training materials and programs accordingly. \n19.  The TA will finance nominal expenses for the trainees, essential training equipment, \nroad survey equipment, and the venue. At the end of the program, trainees will be tested. Those \nwho pass the test will be awarded certificates, and, to the extent possible, be employed in \nprojects financed by ADB, the Government, or other funding agencies\u2014as resident engineers, \ncost/quantity  engineers,  materials  engineers,  or  laboratory  technicians\u2014to  supervise  road \nupgrading, rehabilitation, and maintenance projects and to assure quality. \n ", "  5\nC.  Cost and Financing  \n20.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $706,000. As Timor-Leste uses the US dollar as \nits currency, there is no difference between the foreign exchange and local cost. ADB will \nprovide $600,000, while the Government will provide $106,000 in kind to cover mainly office \naccommodation and remuneration of counterpart staff. The TA will be financed on a grant basis \nby ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The detailed cost estimates are in Appendix 2.  \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n21.  The OPM will be the Executing Agency for Component 1 of the TA, under the direction \nof the Secretary of State for Infrastructure Development, who will chair a multi-agency body to \nprovide strategic and policy direction to the TA. The multi-agency body will preferably be a \nstanding infrastructure coordination committee within the OPM, and not a stand-alone steering \ncommittee for the TA only. It should represent all agencies with core infrastructure interests, and \nrepresentatives should be at director general level and above. For the road sector, at least one \nEnglish-speaking government counterpart staff will be assigned to help consultants liaise with \nthe Government and other stakeholders.  \n22.  The new Government road agency (expected to be designated the Ministry of Public \nWorks) will be the Executing Agency for the second component. For each training session, the \nGovernment will assign two English-speaking coordinators out of the 15 government trainees to \nwork with the international consulting team. Directorate of Roads, Bridges and Flood Control \ncoordinators will help identify appropriate candidates for training, ensuring user-friendliness of \nthe training materials, organizing the training workshop, and facilitating on-the-job training. \n23.  The TA will require a total of 23 person-months of international consulting services. Nine \nperson-months will be for preparing a multisector integrated institutional development road map, \nassociated terms of reference, and comprehensive capacity-development road map for the road \nsector. Fourteen person-months will be for road engineering training in the areas of road design, \nquantification,  costing,  contract  packaging,  quality  control,  construction  supervision,  and \ncontract management. The TA will be implemented over 3 years, starting in November 2005 \nand ending in November 2008. The international consulting firm will be recruited by ADB in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Guidelines  on  the  Use  of  Consultants,  using  ADB\u2019s  quality-based \nselection.  (QBS)  method.  QBS  is  justified  because  the  quality  of  the  consultants  and  the \nproposed approach are critical to ensuring that the medium-term capacity-building road maps \nwill be guiding documents for ADB\u2019s continued involvement in the infrastructure sectors and that \nthe training program will bring tangible capacity improvement to the road sector. A simplified \ntechnical proposal format will be used to invite and evaluate the proposals from the international \nconsulting firm. The detailed terms of reference for the consulting services are in Appendix 3. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n24.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $600,000 on a grant basis to \nthe Government of Timor-Leste for Infrastructure Sectors Capacity Development, and hereby \nreports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nPerformance  Data  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms \nImpact      Assumptions \nImproved infrastructure  - Improved local, national,  - Sector performance  \u2022  Adequate national \nservices available to  and international transport  reports from ministries  budget allocations for \npeople in all urban and  connectivity  and partners  infrastructure \nrural areas  - Consolidation Support  \u2022 Ongoing government \n- Improved delivery of power \nProgram (CSP)  commitment to reform \nto urban and rural customers \nmissions and reports  agenda, including \n- Improved access to water  corporatization and \n- National Budget \nsupply and sanitation  private sector \npapers (reduction of \nservices in urban and rural  participation \nsubsidies) \nareas  \u2022 Sustained national \n- Annual reports by  economic development \n- Improved \nurban monopolies and  \u2022 Sustained peace and \ntelecommunications \ncontracted firms  security \nconnectivity \n- Improved urban \nenvironmental sanitation \nOutcome      Assumptions \nMore integrated  - All opportunities fully  - Progress reports of the  \u2022 Secretary of State for \nmultisector strategic plans,  exploited to achieve  Secretary of State for  Infrastructure \nlaws, regulations, capital  government synergies across  Infrastructure  Development has \nprograms, rural service  infrastructure sectors  sufficient budget and \n- Sector performance \narrangements, and urban  - The operations and  power to require and \nreports from ministries \nmonopoly operations and  systems of infrastructure  oversee cross sector \nand partners \na strong road sector  urban monopolies are  approaches. \nmanagement capability  integrated, shared, and  - Publicly available  \u2022 Development partners \nharmonized to the maximum  legislation, regulations,  support a multisector, \nextent possible  policies  multidonor approach to \n  infrastructure capacity \n- CSP missions and \ndevelopment \nreports \n- Annual reports of \nurban monopolies and \ncontracted firms \n \n- Improved road sector  - Project \ncapacity development  implementation/ \nprogramming, budgeting, and  completion reports for \ndelivery  Road Sector \n  Improvement Project \n\u2022 New Minister for Public \n \n- Reports from JICA  Works is committed  to \nadvisor to the Minister  capacity development \nfor Public Works \n- Road sector capacity \nassessment \n ", "Appendix 1  7\nPerformance  Data  Assumptions and \nDesign Summary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  Risks \nMechanisms \nImproved road  By November 2008, the  - Government recruiting,  \u2022 Government salaries \nfollowing number of trainees  organization, and  and professional \nengineering capability in  are employed and working as  staffing pattern reports  opportunities will be \nqualified engineers or  - Follow-up survey of  sufficient to retain \ngovernment and the  technicians:  workshop graduates  qualified employees \n   \n(i)  at least 30 resident \nprivate sector  \u2022 Ample job opportunities \nengineers; \ncontinue to exist for \n(ii)  at least 10  qualified engineers in \ncost/quantity  the private sector \nengineers; \n\u2022 Qualified workshop \n(iii)  at least 10 materials  graduates will be \nengineers; and  interested in working for \nthe ministries involved \n(iv) at least 10 laboratory \nin road infrastructure \ntechnicians \nand/or the domestic \n  consulting industry \n\u2022 An adequate number of \npositions will be \nestablished and funded \nby the ministries \ninvolved in road \ninfrastructure \nRisk \n\u2022 Qualified graduates may \nbe attracted to work \noutside the country \nand/or the government \ninfrastructure sectors \nOutputs      Assumptions \n1.
