THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SUBPROJECT \nA.  Overall Progress of the TA cluster \n1.  The  Technical  Assistance  Cluster  (C\u2013TA)  for  Sustainable  Infrastructure  Assistance \nProgram (SIAP) is financed by the Government of Australia through the Department of Foreign \nAffairs and Trade and administered by Asian Development Bank (ADB).  SIAP was approved on \n17 June 2013 and is due to close on 30 June 2019. As of 19 January 2018, total commitments \nare $11,108,237 (75% of total approvals against time elapsed of 75%), and disbursements are \n$7,306,652 (66% of commitments). Fifteen subprojects have been approved. Three of these are \nnow closed. Two other subprojects were endorsed by the SIAP Steering Committee on 13 June \n2017. This technical assistance proposal is one of those subprojects. Two additional subprojects, \nwhich  includes  this  technical  assistance  proposal,  were  endorsed  by  the  SIAP  Steering \nCommittee on 13 June 2017. The SIAP Steering Committee also approved additional financing \nfor two existing subprojects for a total value of $2.435 million. SIAP is on track to meet its outcome \nand outputs. SIAP has contributed to the preparation and implementation of approved projects \nand programs of more than $5 billion. As of 19 January 2018, C\u2013TA 0013\u2013INO: SIAP has an \navailable balance of $3,045,777, including the ADB management fee and foreign exchange \nreservations. \n \nB.  Subproject Outcome \n2.  The  TA  subproject  will  have  the  following  outcome:  priorities  and  strategies  for  a \nsustainable, affordable, and secure energy sector are included in the National Medium-Term \nDevelopment Plan 2020\u20132024 (RPJMN20). \n \n3.  The TA subproject is consistent with the Indonesia country partnership strategy 2016\u2013\n2019 priority of improved infrastructure service. It directly responds to the sub-priority areas of \nclean energy, reforms to accelerate investment and growth, and policy and institutional reform. It \nalso addresses the cross-cutting area of climate change and environment focus on sustainable \ninfrastructure. \n \n4.  The TA subproject responds to the country partnership strategy\u2019s Indonesia Country \nKnowledge Plan 2016\u20132019, which guides ADB\u2019s engagement in the preparation and provision \nof  knowledge  products  and  services  to  Indonesia.  The  TA  subproject  also  responds  to  a \ngovernment request and is timed to coincide with the preparation of the government\u2019s RPJMN20. \nIt is based on the ADB\u2019s ongoing policy-based lending in the energy-sector under the Sustainable \nand Inclusive Energy Program and the lessons-learned from the ongoing investment lending \noperations in the electricity and gas sectors maximize operational knowledge. \n \n5.  The TA subproject will contribute to the outcome of the overall TA cluster to improve \nproject readiness and development of a set of bankable projects in the energy services sector by \nsupporting the government in refining its medium-term strategy for energy infrastructure and \nidentifying key bottlenecks for private sector investment in energy infrastructure delivery until 2024.  \n \nC.  Subproject Outputs, Methods, and Activities  \n6.  The TA subproject will provide support to the drafting of the RPJMN20 and link it to the \nobjectives and guiding principles of the National Energy Policy, the General Energy Plan, the \n ", "2 \nGeneral Electricity Development Plan, and other energy-related government plans and hence \ncoordinate with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, the National Energy Council (DEN), \nand the State Electricity Corporation (PLN). The TA subproject will contribute to ADB\u2019s new \ncountry partnership strategy 2020\u20132024. It will facilitate discussions and identify strategic pillars \nand actions to continue the sustainable transformation of Indonesia\u2019s energy sector. It aims at \naddressing regulatory and financial bottlenecks to increase Indonesia\u2019s energy security, provide \nenergy  access  for  all,  and  ensure  the  financial  viability  of  clean  energy  production  and \nconsumption in the country. In doing so, it will contribute to further the achievement of the United \nNation\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals in the energy sector for which the ADB has taken the \nlead in Southeast Asia. \n   \n7.  Output: Provide policy advice for energy sector planning in Indonesia.  The TA \nsubproject will provide substantial analytical support to key issues for Indonesia\u2019s sustainable and \ninclusive energy sector development and support a comprehensive assessment of energy supply \nand demand in Indonesia. Key focus areas will be the electricity sector, with increased focus on \nrenewable energy, sustainable energy pricing and supply cost, and the identification of financial \nmechanisms to support renewable energy development. The TA subproject will highlight the \nopportunities  from  energy  efficiency  measures,  and  identify  technological  and  regulatory \ninnovation, for example for the newly identified Special Economic Zones, to help the government \naddress the energy trilemma of security, sustainability and affordability. The TA subproject will \nsupport the government in reviewing its results indicators under the RPJMN20 to better assess \nachievements towards inclusive and sustainable growth under its energy targets. \n \n8.  Activity 1: Assessment of achievements under RPJMN 2015\u20132019 and annotated \ntable of contents for the white paper. The TA subproject will assess the state, progress and \nachievements of energy-sector related policies and investments under the 3rd RPJMN 2015\u20132019 \n(RPJMN15), which was based on the guiding principles to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nwhile strengthening national energy security, and which was supported by the ADB via a previous \nWhite Paper. Sector-wise, the TA subproject will look at all energy-subsectors with special focus \non electricity, energy efficiency, downstream gas, and energy infrastructure as well as  the \nassessment indicators. The TA subproject will assess the goals of the RPJMN15: (i) strengthening \nthe availability of primary energy through oil production, supported by gas and coal production; \n(ii)  increasing  the  domestic  use  of  primary  energy  resources;  and  (iii)  achieving  a  96.6% \nelectrification ratio and with renewable energy reaching 10%\u201315% of the energy mix. The TA \nsubproject will use the RPJMN15 energy sector goals as benchmarks. It will also assess ADB\u2019s \ncontribution to the targets under the RPJMN15 and evaluate the role of the key central and \nregional government, state-owned, and private sector players in this process. A key focus will be \nthe review of the RPJMN15\u2019s energy related indicators. The TA subproject will also address \nenergy pricing and other financial incentives and barriers to increase the sustainability of the \nenergy  sector.  This  will  include  a  review  of  all  underlying  policy,  regulatory,  and  financial \ndocuments available.  \n \n9.  Activity  2:  First  draft  of  the  white  paper  and  key  RPJMN  2020\u20132024 \nrecommendations for discussion with government officials and stakeholders. Based on this \nprior assessment of achievements, the TA subproject will evaluate Indonesia\u2019s expected energy \nsector development per sub-sector for both supply and demand  based on existing energy \nmodeling by the ADB, the International Energy Agency, the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations Centre for Energy, the Ministry for Energy and Mineral Resources, the DEN, and others. \nElectricity  and  renewable  energy  provision  will  be  key  areas  for  the  TA  subproject.  The \nsupply/demand analysis will focus on the inter-related trilemma of ensuring energy security while \nincreasing sustainability and assuring the affordability and cost-reflection of energy prices, with a \n ", "3 \nview to improving the financial and operational situation of key energy-related state-owned \nenterprises. Based on the existing indicators for the RPJMN15 the TA subproject will provide \nsuggestions on how to better break down and focus key indicators such as electricity consumption \nper capita to allow for better tracking of actual progress. This will include focus group discussions \nwith energy and industry officials and development partners. Special attention will be given to \nidentifying the heterogeneity of energy access in Indonesia\u2019s main island clusters as well as to \ninnovative energy options to support Indonesia\u2019s digital and industrial transition. This should \ninclude an analysis of the adequate regulatory frameworks for large and small islands, energy \nstorage options to increase renewables in small islands, and in general the enhancement of \nsupply and demand-side efficiency. The analysis will take into full account Indonesia\u2019s existing \ncommitments under its Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement.  \n \n10.  Activity  3:  Second  and  final  draft  report  and  key  RPJMN  2020\u20132024 \nrecommendations for discussion with government officials. Part 3 of the TA subproject will \ndiscuss and identify the policy and regulatory developments and investments needed to support \nIndonesia\u2019s transition to a sustainable, secure, and affordable energy sector and focus on energy \nproduction  and  consumption  pricing,  infrastructure  development  regulations,  private  sector \nparticipation, and technical standard setting. This activity will include focus group discussions with \nofficials from the energy-related Ministries and non-governmental representatives which form part \nof the DEN and non-governmental organizations. It will be supported by a public survey to assess \nthe priorities and challenges on energy production and consumption of Indonesia\u2019s citizens. Public \nsupport to, and understanding of energy sector reforms is deemed critical for the continuation of \nthe government\u2019s reform process from 2019 onwards. \n \n11.  Activity 4: Final dissemination conference at Minister level. The final Energy Sector \nWhite Paper will provide recommendations to the government  to establish a medium-term \ndevelopment agenda for the energy sector. This should include special attention to increasing \nmodern energy options, financing, and digital innovation, as well as decentralization options \ncritical to develop Indonesia\u2019s remote provinces and localities. It will be publicly available and \ninform  the  national  and  international  debate  and  strategy  to  enhance  the  sustainable \ntransformation of Indonesia\u2019s energy sector. \n \n12.  Activity 5: High-quality analytical sector thought-papers. The main part of the TA \nsubproject, the White Paper, will be supported by several thought-papers that will provide selected \ninputs to the National Development Planning Agency, PLN, and other government entities. These \nwill include an analysis of the cost of generation including procurement cost under different \nscenarios for state-owned enterprises, clean energy technology de-risking and cost, and third-\nparty access to transmission networks among others. This will also help extract the ADB\u2019s \noperational knowledge from past and ongoing investment projects and translate the findings into \nanalytical advice for the government. \n \nD.  Subproject Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,050,000 of which $1,000,000 will be financed from the C-\nTA 0013-INO: SIAP on a grant basis by the Government of Australia and administered by ADB. \nThe government will provide in-kind contributions in the form of counterpart staff, office space, \nsecretarial assistance and other in-kind contributions. The detailed cost estimates and financing \nplan are shown in Appendix 2.  \n \n ", "4 \nE.  Subproject Implementation Arrangements \n14.  The Energy Division of the Southeast Asia Department will select, supervise, and evaluate \nconsultants.  The  government,  in  coordination  with  ADB,  will  organize  and  conduct  the \nworkshops.1 \n \nTable 1: Subproject Implementation Arrangements \nAspects   Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  April 2018\u2013June 2019  \nExecuting agency  National Development Planning Agency (BAPPENAS) \nImplementing agencies   \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by ADB \nQuality-  40 person- $638,000 \nand cost- months \n \nbased \n \nselection  \nSurvey    $100,000 \nIndividual  26.6 person- $210,000 \nConsultant  months \nSelection \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following ADB's Technical Assistance \nDisbursement Handbook (2010, as amended from time to time). \n \n15.

ADB will engage consulting firms and individual consultants in \naccordance with ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and the \nassociated Project Administration Instructions/Technical Assistance Staff Instructions.2 The main \nbody of work will be undertaken by a consulting firm. In addition, individual consultants will be \nhired by the ADB to supplement the analysis of the consulting firm. The consulting firm will need \nto have experience in energy policy and sector consulting in Indonesia and be able to field \ninternational and local experts on energy policy, electricity networks and supply (with a focus on \nrenewable energy), oil and gas upstream, oil and gas downstream, energy efficiency and climate \nchange  mitigation,  coal,  digital  energy  systems  (grids)  and  decentralization,  financial  and \ninsurance  aspects  of  energy  infrastructure,  Indonesia\u2019s  legal  system  and  policy-making  as \nneeded. The core consultant team will consist of an International and a National Energy Lead \nSpecialist and work with the National Development Planning Agency drawing on additional sub-\nsector expertise where necessary, and coordinate with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral \nResources, DEN, and PLN. The consultant will procure the necessary packages to hold three \nmajor roundtables and at least 30\u201350 sector-specific discussions. Quality-cost ratio is being \nestablished at 90:10 under a simplified technical proposal. The TA subproject envisages 17 \ninternational consultant person-months and up to 50 national consultant person-months. \n \n16.  A survey will be contracted by the consulting firm from local companies in Indonesia to \nundertake a public survey on energy development, priorities, affordability, and other pertinent \nquestions relevant for production, usage, demand, prices, support, and priorities. The individual \nconsultants will be hired on basis of specific global sector knowledge and/or local on the ground \nexperience with Indonesia energy sector to be able to support the process on specific sectoral \nissues. An ADB in-country program analyst will be hired to help with back office support. Key \n                                                \n1  Output-based contracts and lumpsum out-of-pocket expense payments will be considered, as appropriate. \n2  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "5 \nexpertise would include electricity supply cost and pricing, clean energy finance and insurance, \nnetworks, digital systems, and decentralization, and others on needs basis. \n \n17.  Social media and websites. The consulting firm is expected to establish a OneDrive \ndocument and information repository that is accessible by all consultants / knowledge partners \nand can be used to make information available to future ADB teams that may continue such \nanalytical work in the future. All consultants are expected to store their materials there for future \nuse. The relevant OneDrive will be closed after TA completion and all materials will be transferred \nto ADB for internal backup.\n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nSUBPROJECT DESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \nImpacts the TA subproject is aligned with: \n(i)  the Government\u2019s energy-related analysis under RPJMN 2020\u20132024 is strengthened; and \n(ii)  the energy-sector planning of BAPPENAS and other key government actors is \nstrengthened \n \nData Sources \nResults  Performance Indicators with Targets and  and Reporting \nChain   Baselines  Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome  By 2021:     \nPriorities and  The identified priority areas for Indonesia\u2019s  Published  New \nstrategies for  energy sector development under the RPJMN are  RPJMN  government \na sustainable,  included in the RPJMN20 (2018 baseline: N/A)  completely \naffordable,    changes \nand secure    energy sector \nenergy sector  strategy \nincluded in   \nthe National  New Ministers \nMedium-Term  do not approve \nDevelopment  the White \nPlan  Paper \n(RPJMN)   \n2020\u20132024  \n \nOutput  By 2019:     \nPolicy advice  1.
