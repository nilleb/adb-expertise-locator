In 2001, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) approved its social protection strategy.1 \nSince then, ADB has implemented it by including social protection projects and programs in the \ncountry strategy programs of developing member countries (DMCs).  \n \n2.  In December 2002, a concept to develop a social protection index (SPI) was endorsed \nfor funding by the (i) Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund (PRF) of the United Kingdom\u2019s \nDepartment  of  International  Development,  and  (ii)  the  Netherlands\u2019  Cooperation  Fund  in \nSupport of the Formulation and Implementation of National Poverty Reduction Strategies. ADB \ndecided to pilot-test the SPI in a regional technical assistance (TA) in six countries (Bangladesh, \nIndonesia,  Mongolia,  Nepal,  Pakistan,  and  Viet  Nam).  In  December  2005,  TA  61202 was \ncompleted successfully.  \n \n3.  Given the positive feedback on the pilot phase and the proven role of SPI in analyzing \ninformation about social protection achievements, policy dialogue, and program design, the \nconcept of a follow-up project to develop the SPI for all Asian member countries of ADB was \nendorsed for PRF funding by the Department of International Development on 4 October 2005 3 \nand cleared by the vice presidents for operations groups 1 and 2. The TA framework is in \nAppendix 1. The governments of 31 countries have been asked to concur, and two thirds have \nagreed to be included. The remaining countries are expected to agree. \n \nII.  ISSUES \n4.  Social protection is defined as a set of policies and programs to reduce poverty and \nvulnerability by (i) promoting efficient labor markets, (ii) diminishing people's exposure to risks, \nand (iii) enhancing their capacity to protect themselves against hazards and interruption or loss \nof income.  \n \n5.  All DMCs have more or less comprehensive social protection schemes. They include \nformal  and  informal  sector  social  protection  financed  by  the  government  budget  and  by \ncontributions from individuals, the private sector, nongovernment organizations (NGOs), and \ndevelopment partners. However, social protection concepts vary greatly among DMCs. No \ncomprehensive studies describe, analyze, and compare social protection schemes in Asia. The \nInternational Social Security Association maintains a database with basic information on formal \nsocial security schemes,4 but no information is available showing, analyzing, and comparing the \nwide range of formal and informal protection schemes in all countries of Asia. The proposed TA \nwill provide this information. \n \n6.  Little has been done to measure quantitative dimensions of all the areas of social \nprotection. Reliable data on social protection schemes are scarce or unavailable, but are a \nprerequisite for effective planning and monitoring of social protection measures and an informed \ndebate on social protection policies and measures. The International Labour Organization (ILO) \nhas compiled and analyzed formal social protection data in various Asian countries using its \nsocial budgeting model and in its Social Protection Expenditure and Performance Reviews.5 \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 2001.

To support ADB\u2019s social protection strategy, increase awareness about social protection, \nand improve the role of social protection in national and international policy discussions, various \nquestions should be answered: (i) How should social protection be defined in each DMC? Social \nprotection policies, mechanisms, and instruments vary from one country to another owing to \ndifferences in needs, resources, history, and priorities. (ii) What is the status of social protection \nin DMCs? Which tools are applied? What resources are dedicated to social protection? Who is \ncovered? What is the experience in poverty reduction and prevention? (iii) How can countries\u2019 \nachievements be measured and compared? In the medium term, how can the implementation \nand the impact of ADB\u2019s social protection strategy be monitored? \n \n8.  To address these issues, ADB commissioned TA 6120 (footnote 2), which has resulted \nin the creation of a robust methodology for (i) defining social protection in each country covered; \n(ii) gathering qualitative data on target population and benefits of social protection schemes and \narrangements, following a uniform structure and methodology for inclusion of programs and \nschemes;  and  (iii)  gathering  basic  quantitative  data  and  calculating  an  SPI  that  permits \nintercountry comparisons and monitoring of countries\u2019 social protection achievements.  \n \n9.  The  SPI  is  made  up  of  four  component  indicators  reflecting  social  protection \nexpenditure, social protection coverage, poverty targeting of social protection programs, and the \nimpact on poverty line incomes. The following table describes the SPI components. \n \nTable 1: Social Protection Index Components \nComponent  Description \nSocial Protection Expenditure (SPEXP)  SP expenditure as % of GDP \nSocial Protection Coverage (SPCOV)  Combination of coverage rates of seven priority \ntarget groupsa \nPoverty Targeting (PTR)  Poor SP beneficiaries as % of poor population \nSocial Protection Impact (SPIMP)  Per capita SP expenditure on the poor as % of \ncurrent poverty line \na   The seven priority groups are the unemployed and underemployed, elderly, sick, poor, disabled, and children \nwith special needs. \nSource: Consultants report for ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for the Social Protection Index for Committed \nPoverty Reduction. Manila. \n \n10.  These  indicators  are  derived  from  information  on  the  individual  social  protection \nprograms in each country, which were compiled for the first time by TA 6120 for six pilot \ncountries.  The  SPI  components  were  combined  using  a  method  similar  to  the  human \ndevelopment index, which means they were scaled and equally weighted. Table 2 shows the \nmain indicators derived, the composite SPI, and the ranking for the six countries covered by TA \n6120. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "  3\nTable 2: Main Indicators of Countries Covered by TA 6120 \nSocial Protection Indicators \nComposite \nCountry \nSPI \nExpenditureCoverage Poverty Targeting  SP Impact \nScaled Values          \nMongolia  0.96  1.00  1.00  0.82  1.00 \nIndonesia  0.58  0.18  0.62  1.00  0.52 \nViet Nam  0.51  0.33  0.47  0.70  0.55 \nBangladesh  0.44  0.36  0.21  0.47  0.71 \nNepal  0.29  0.21  0.27  0.36  0.33 \nPakistan  0.13  0.19  0.17  0.07  0.10 \nSource:  Consultants Report for ADB. 2003. Technical Assistance for the Social Protection Index \nfor Committed Poverty Reduction. Manila.  \n \n11.  TA 6120 involved government institutions, officials, development partners, NGOs, and \nstakeholders in each participating country, the international consultants, the national consultants \nin these countries, ADB social protection experts, and external reviewers (e.g., ILO experts). \nThe TA culminated in an international conference in Manila in March 2005, where Government \nrepresentatives and experts endorsed the SPI and its methodology as a valuable tool for \nassessing social protection achievements. The conference concluded that, for the SPI to gain \nbroader acceptance, it would need to cover at least all Asian member countries of ADB. The \ntools6 for this and for updates of the SPI were developed by TA 6120. \n \n12.  The main challenges encountered in TA 6120 were (i) finding a generally applicable \ndefinition of social protection; (ii) defining the components of the index so that they reflect the \nsituation in the countries and, at the same time, are technically feasible; and (iii) getting the \nnecessary  data.  Governments  supported  the  SPI.  Lessons  learned  from  TA  6120  are  the \nfollowing:  (i)  The  index  needs  analysis  and  interpretation.  This  is  why  the  country  and \nconsolidated multi-country reports are necessary. (ii) Countries\u2019 awareness of their own efforts \nand their need for and the benefits of social protection are low. The SPI was welcomed as \nsupport for policy dialogue. (iii) The tests in the pilot countries were necessary and led to \nvarious adjustments and improvements of the methodology and tools. (iv) The methodology has \nits limitations because data is frequently lacking or poor, which has to be taken into account \nwhen interpreting the results. \n \n13.  The  SPI  significantly  contributes  to  operationalizing  the  social  protection  strategy \nbecause it (i) provides the necessary country information, (ii) helps identify gaps and priorities, \nand (iii) provides feedback to improve the design and delivery of social protection services. The \nrobustness of the SPI\u2019s methodology was extensively discussed, tested, and revised during TA \n6120, especially in various technical workshops and the TA conference. The SPI is a useful tool \nfor policy dialogue and for policy makers for identifying strengths and weaknesses of their \nprograms; for comparing countries\u2019 achievements of Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 1, \n3, and 4,7 and for raising awareness of the role and impact of social protection.8 The extension \nto all Asian member countries (including non-borrowing countries like Republic of Korea and \nJapan) will provide a unique source of information and a solid basis for policy and strategy in \n                                                 \n6  The tools mainly consist of (i) a handbook with guidelines on how to obtain the necessary data and how to compile \nthe SPI, (ii) a spreadsheet program to calculate the SPI, and (iii) formats for the accompanying country reports. \n7  MDG1: eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, MDG3: promote gender equality and empower women, MDG4: \nreduce child mortality. \n8  An article about the SPI was published, Baulch, Wood, and Weber. 2006.

To include as many countries as possible is justified because the quality of an \nindex depends on its comprehensiveness, as proven by the human development index. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n14.  The  TA  is  expected  to  support  the  social  protection  strategy  by  extending  the \nmethodology of TA 6120 to all Asian member countries of ADB. It will support social protection \npolicies in the DMCs, which in turn will reduce poverty. \n \n15.  The outcome of the TA will be the following: \n  \n(i)  a definition of social protection as relevant in each country involved in the TA, \n(ii)  comparisons  of  achievements  between  countries  and  over  time    to  monitor \nimplementation of social protection measures, and \n(iii)  information on social protection schemes and policies in the region. \n \n16.  As a result, the TA will provide ADB and member country governments with considerably \nenhanced  quantitative  and  qualitative  information  on  social  protection  activities,  and  an \ninternationally comparable database, including SPI values and indicators of social protection \nexpenditure,  coverage,  distribution,  and  impact.  This  information  will  be  used  to  raise \nawareness of social protection activities and to examine the provision of assistance to key social \nprotection target groups (especially the poor but also the elderly, sick, disabled, and children \nwith  special  needs),  thereby  engendering  actions  to  improve  the  effectiveness  of  current \nactivities and to develop new programs. The SPI will contribute to regional integration. \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n17.  The TA will have four components: \n \n(i)  Component 1: Preparation. A network of local consultants in all participating \ncountries and international consultants will be established and be taught to apply \nthe SPI tools developed and tested under TA 6120. \n(ii)  Component 2: Field work and reporting. Data on each country's major social \nprotection programs will be collected by the local consultants and synthesized \ninto texts and tables as needed. This work will be reviewed by a supervisory \nteam, which will also provide long-distance guidance during data collection. The \nresults  will  be  presented  in  a  series  of  standardized  country  reports  and \nspreadsheets. Models for these reports and tables were elaborated under TA \n6120. This component will include (a) a new evaluation of the methodology; (b) \nthe review of the formulation of the SPI, the assessment of the user friendliness \nand comprehensibility of the handbook; and (c) issues related to data collection \nand compilation. Needs for changes in methodology and presentation will be \nexplored (leading to amendments of the TA 6120 results). \n(iii)  Component 3: Synthesis. The results from component 2 will be combined into a \nmulti-country report by the international supervisory team. The report, which will \ninclude an SPI database, will present (a) cross-country comparisons of SPIs and \ncomponent indicators, (b) an evaluation of the results, (c) implications for social \nprotection  activities  by  the  member  countries  and  international  financial \ninstitutions,  and  (d)  additional  options  and  guidelines  for  updating  and \nsustainability of the SPI.  \n ", "  5\n(iv)  Component 4: Dissemination and awareness raising. The results of the TA \nwill be widely publicized through a book and articles, an interactive website, and \nmedia events. Discussions are ongoing with ILO to share the methodology to \nextend the SPI beyond Asia. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n18.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $900,000 equivalent. ADB will finance the total \namount of $900,000 equivalent. The TA will be funded on a grant basis from the PRF and \nadministered by ADB. The detailed cost estimates and the financing plan are in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n19.  The  TA  will  be  carried  out  over  18  months,  from  May  2006  to  November  2007. \nConsultants' inputs will amount to 70 person-months: 60 domestic and 10 international. The \ninternational consultants will include a statistician (6 person-months) and a social protection \nspecialist  (4  person-months).  The  domestic  consultants will  consist  of  30  social  protection \nspecialists (1\u20132 person-months each depending on the size of the country). All consultants will \nbe recruited through a firm in accordance with ADB's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants and \nother arrangements satisfactory to ADB for engaging domestic consultants. It is recommended \nto use the same firm that worked under TA 6120 because (i) the methodology is the same as \nTA  6120\u2019s  and  (ii)  its  performance  was  highly  satisfactory.  Outline  terms  of  reference  for \nconsultants is in Appendix 3. \n \n20.  The Executing Agency for the TA will be ADB, acting through Social Sectors Division, \nSouth Asia Department, in close coordination with the regional departments, the Economics and \nResearch Department, and the Regional and Sustainable Development Department. \n \n21.  Component 1: The instruction and coordination of the local consultants will be done by \nthe international consultants in consultation with ADB. Component 2: The statistical preparation \nand computation of the index for the TA DMCs will be done by local consultants hired by the \nconsulting  firm.  Component  3:  The  final  reports  will  be  prepared  by  the  international \nconsultants. ADB will give guidance and comments (an outline of the final report is in Appendix \n4). Component 4: The publication of the results, including on the interactive website, will be \ndone by ADB. \n \n22.  The consulting firm will submit short progress reports every 6 months, summarizing \nproject activities, issues, and constraints. Four major reports will also be submitted: (i) an \ninception report, including a work plan for the TA, within 3 weeks after the TA starts; (ii) \nindividual country reports, discussed with ADB 10 months after inception; (iii) a draft final report \ncomprising the multi-country report, 17 months after inception; and (iv) a final report, 4 weeks \nafter ADB comments are received.  \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n23.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $900,000 to be financed on a \ngrant basis by the Poverty Reduction Cooperation Fund, for Scaling Up of the Social Protection \nIndex for Committed Poverty Reduction, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data Sources/Monitoring  Assumptions \nSummary  Indicators/Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact       \n      Risk \nReduce poverty by  The SPI has broadened  Reports, reaction of  Some DMCs have other \nsupporting social protection  recognition of the importance of  stakeholders and media,  priorities and will not be \nin the DMCs   social protection in Asia.  acceptance of the index in  convinced by the index and \nDMCs participating in the  its objectives. \nregional TA \n \nOutcome       \n      Assumption \nA definition of social  Social protection sector has  Individual country reports  Availability of data \nprotection as relevant in  been clearly defined in all TA     \neach country involved in  countries.      \nthe TA       \n      Risk \nComparisons between  All Asian member countries of  Multi-country reports  Difficulties in defining which \ncountries to implement  ADB have been compared    activities and projects are \nsocial protection  applying the SPI.    social protection \n       \n       \nInformation on social  Qualitative descriptions of  Individual country reports   \nprotection schemes and  social protection schemes are   \npolicies in the region  available.   \n \nOutputs     \n      Assumption \nComponent 1: Preparation  Local consultants are aware of  Progress reports  Availability of data \n  the methodology developed in     \n  the pilot project and are can     \n  collect data following a general     \n  format.     \n       \nComponent 2: Field work  The required information about    Risk \n  all countries, and the index are  Progress reports, individual  The index is not accepted \n  available.  country reports.  by all participating \n      countries. \nComponent 3: Synthesis  An SPI database, cross-  \n  country comparisons, an  Multi-country report \n  analysis and evaluation of the   \n  results, and potential   \n  implications for social   \n  protection activities and   \n  options for sustainability and   \n  updating are available.    \n     \nComponent 4:  The results have been   \nDissemination  published in a book and  Book and website \narticles.
