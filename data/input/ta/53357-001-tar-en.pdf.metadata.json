INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) transfers knowledge and technical \ncapacity on the methods used to analyze debt and assess debt sustainability in Asia and the \nPacific. There are two components to the TA. The first focuses on data analysis and research and \nassesses debt sustainability across the developing member countries (DMCs) of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB). In-depth thematic, empirical, and country studies, which will involve \ninternational experts and practitioners, will identify the main aspects of debt vulnerability in the \nregion and discuss remedial policy options. The studies will be published as a collection and \ndisclosed to stakeholders and the public. The second component enhances the capacity to \nassess debt sustainability among DMCs. Training activities will be held for DMC officials, followed \nby support and tutoring to ensure that recipients can apply the knowledge. Capacity building will \nbe  tailored  to  local  circumstances  and  demands\u2013\u2013which  the  TA  will  identify  with  DMC \nstakeholders, ADB regional departments, and international partner organizations\u2013\u2013and will stay \nwithin the limits of the TA budget.  \n \n2.  The TA is included in the work program and budget framework of ADB\u2019s Economic \nResearch and Regional Cooperation Department (ERCD) and is aligned with Strategy 2030\u2019s \nsixth operational priority of strengthening governance and institutional capacity.1 The TA will help \nstrengthen the analytical capacity of public institutions regarding debt sustainability, which aligns \nwith Strategy 2030\u2019s focus on strong institutional capacity as the basis for country development.2  \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  The world\u2019s debt is approaching 250% of global gross domestic product. The mounting \ndebt  ratios  worldwide  have  caused  policy  makers  to  focus  on  debt  sustainability  and  the \nchallenges a global debt overhang entails. The complacency of markets notwithstanding, the risks \nassociated with heightened debt are a crucial global economic policy issue involving advanced, \nemerging, and developing economies alike. The international community voiced these concerns \nalso at the April 2019 meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, \nand the May 2019 annual meeting of ADB in Fiji.  \n \n4.  Across DMCs, the average ratio of total debt to gross domestic product has grown beyond \n200%, or two-thirds in the past decade alone, mainly because of surging private debt.3 Unusually \nlow interest rates and easy monetary policies fueled credit booms to support investment and \ngrowth and international capitals\u2019 search for higher yields. This caused debt ratios to balloon, \nincluding in some of Asia\u2019s most vibrant emerging economies. Fortunately, most countries in the \nregion continue to enjoy a large growth\u2013interest rate differential that is keeping public debt ratios \nin check. Also, compared to when the Asian crisis struck in the late 1990s, reserves are generally \nhigher, external exposure is less, and the macroeconomic footing is more sound today. \n \n5.  While  the  outlook  appears  to  be  benign,  many  economies  remain  susceptible  to \nexogenous price shocks; intensifying risks of disasters, capital flight, reserves erosion; or have \ndebt profiles complicated by currency or term mismatches. Sources of vulnerability abound across \n                                                \n1  ADB. 2018. Strategy 2030: Achieving a Prosperous, Inclusive Resilient, and Sustainable Asia and the Pacific. Manila. \n2  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 September 2019. \n3  The ratio is computed as the average of public and private debt weighted by gross national income, based on the \n2018 IMF Global Debt Database, with data available up to 2017.  \nhttps://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/datasets/GDD2018 (accessed 27 August 2019). \n \n ", "2   \nthe region, especially among the lower-income and less diversified economies, several of which \nthe IMF and World Bank classified this past year as being at high risk of debt distress, a \ndowngrade from earlier assessments.  \n \n6.  Additional challenges facing the region have emerged. For example, contingent liabilities \nin relation to highly leveraged households and non-financial corporations may result from shocks \nsuch as a mortgage crisis or a sharp hike in effective interest rates. In some economies, this could \nconstitute a significant systemic risk that may end up weighing on public finances and debt. \nFurther challenges stem from a shift in countries\u2019 borrowing portfolios towards new creditors, \nsovereign and commercial, and a rising incidence of highly collateralized debt contracts and other \nfinancial arrangements that affect a country\u2019s debt sustainability yet remain undisclosed to the \npublic and the broader community of creditors.  \n \n7.  Against this shifting backdrop, policy makers often find themselves ill-equipped with the \nanalytical  tools  and  know-how  necessary  to  effectively  assess  risk  in  the  context  of  debt \nmanagement and policy surveillance. Limited capacity to assess debt sustainability leaves credit \nrisks unaccounted for, undermines debt management, and heightens the probability of adverse \ndevelopments and debt crises in DMCs. The TA aims to counter this risk by narrowing the \nknowledge gap through the targeted transfer of analytical capabilities where they are needed \nmost. It will do so by supporting and complementing the work of the World Bank and IMF, \nespecially in fostering DMCs\u2019 capacity to adopt and apply the latest advances in the debt \nsustainability frameworks for market access countries and low-income countries, and through \nresearch targeting areas of heightened vulnerability in the region. \n \n8.  The TA will build on previous work in the field of debt sustainability analysis accomplished \nby ERCD, particularly Regional Technical Assistance 7662 \u201cSovereign Debt Sustainability in Asia \nand  Pacific\u201d  (concluded  in  December  2012),  and  Small-Scale  Research  and  Development \nTechnical Assistance 8893 \u201cExploring Risk-Based Debt Sustainability Assessment Methods\u201d \n(concluded in May 2017). Through its research and capacity building activities, the TA forms part \nof ADB\u2019s bank-wide approach in support of public debt management, which involves plans for two \nfurther TA projects within ADB, one providing capacity development in DMCs\u2019 sovereign asset-\nliability management, and another supporting debt management in Asian Development Fund \ncountries at a high or moderate risk of debt distress. ADB\u2019s TAs in these areas will jointly \ncontribute to building capacity for the effective monitoring and managing of public debt and fiscal \nrisks, a core element of the Multipronged Approach for addressing emerging debt vulnerabilities \npromoted by the World Bank and IMF. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n9.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: DMCs\u2019 debt sustainability improved.4 The TA \nwill have the following outcome: DMCs\u2019 capacity to assess debt sustainability strengthened.5  \n                                                \n4  The TA\u2019s impact is aligned with Strategy 2030\u2019s sixth operational priority of strengthening governance and institutional \ncapacity (footnote 1) and its aims to strengthen ADB\u2019s role as a knowledge provider and DMC\u2019s institutional capacity \nin addressing development issues. \n5  The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "  3 \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n10.  Output 1: Research outputs on debt sustainability in Asia disseminated. Overview, \nthematic, case, and country studies will characterize debt profiles and sustainability issues in the \nregion and discuss the main challenges ahead. These studies will focus on and add value beyond \nstandard debt sustainability assessments, e.g., estimating risks in relation to contingent liabilities \nfrom corporate and household debt.6 The studies will be prepared in collaboration with leading \nscholars and practitioners and will be published by ADB as an edited volume in partnership with \na reputable publisher. A free electronic version will be disclosed to the public, and a limited \nnumber of printed copies will be disseminated to key stakeholders.7 The TA will also produce \njournal articles, working papers, blogs, and contributions to ADB\u2019s corporate publications, such \nas the Asia Bond Monitor. To support TA research activities, a broad range of data on DMC public \nand external debt will be collected and updated regularly within the limits of public data availability.  \n \n11.  Output  2:  Technical  capacity  building  on  debt  analytics  and  sustainability \nassessment methods delivered. Several DMCs partially lack the analytical tools and capacity \nneeded to effectively assess vulnerabilities stemming from factors such as elevated private \ncorporate debt, hidden liabilities, or exposure to disasters triggered by natural hazards. Technical \nsupport to these countries is sporadic and often comes in the form of standardized courses that \nare insufficiently customized to local circumstances and have little impact on local capacity. To fill \nthis gap, the TA will transfer crucial skillsets and technical knowledge through a combination of \ncustom-tailored training, tutoring, and providing expert consultancy. Recipients from DMC debt \nmanagement offices, the ministry of finance, the central bank, or other government agencies will \nfirst receive training on the debt sustainability frameworks as developed by the World Bank and \nthe IMF and/or other complementary analytical tools. To ensure that DMC government institutions \nwill optimally absorb and apply the newly acquired analytical skills, they will also be offered \nsupport while adapting these frameworks to the specific context of application, including through \ntemporary on-site support where feasible. To assure complementarity and alignment of objectives, \nthe TA will coordinate with partner institutions operating in the region, such as the IMF\u2013Singapore \nRegional Training Institute. The TA  aims  to  train  at  least  80  officials  in  DMCs\u2014mainly  in \ncoordination with debt management offices and involving the budget and planning departments\u2014\nthat are interested and suitable to participate, in consultation with ADB departments and resident \nmissions, as appropriate.  \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The TA is estimated to cost $1,500,000, which will be financed on a grant basis by ADB\u2019s \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund (TASF 6). The key expenditure items are listed in Appendix \n2. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  ADB will administer the TA. ERCD\u2019s Office of the Chief Economist and Director General \n(EROD) will be responsible for supervision and management of consultants, procurement, and \naccomplishment of the outputs. For optimal coordination and synergy as \u201cOne ADB,\u201d especially \n                                                \n6  The TA debt studies are meant to complement rather than substitute the IMF and the World Bank\u2019s debt sustainability \nassessments and underlying data, which continue to be the go-to reference for lending policies. \n7  Copies will be made available on demand from a limited stock produced by the external publisher in accordance with \nthe copublishing agreement that will be determined. Depending on the publisher, the number of buyback copies \ntypically ranges from between 50 to 200 units, a relatively small price to pay considering the benefits of having the \nTA research outputs disseminated through this channel.  \n ", "4   \nregarding capacity building, EROD will coordinate with ADB\u2019s other departments and resident \nmissions and rely on their collaboration and support, as appropriate. In particular, the regional \ndepartments  will  help  identify  suitable  DMC  recipients  and  facilitate  capacity  building  in \ncoordination with country authorities. For possible research collaboration and joint conferences \nand dissemination activities, the TA will also identify and partner with reputable regional or global \nresearch institutions.  \n \n14.

ADB will engage the consultants following the ADB Procurement \nPolicy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions.8 Up to 10 individual international consultants will be engaged for the \nresearch project to prepare analytical, country, and case studies involving debt analytics in Asia. \nOne national consultant will be hired to assist with data collection and analysis. For capacity \nbuilding activities, the TA will engage two or more individual international consultants to support \non-site activities and one national consultant to coordinate training. ADB will engage experts, \nwhich could include ADB staff, as resource persons to produce knowledge products and facilitate \ntraining. Engaging individual consultants will provide more benefits to ADB than engaging a firm \nbecause the experience and qualifications of individual experts on debt analytics are of crucial \nimportance to the implementation of the TA.9 It would also be difficult to find a firm that specializes \nin the field of debt sustainability assessments in Asia. \n \n                                                \n8 Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3).
