The Government of Thailand has requested technical assistance (TA) from the Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to support the National Economic and Social Development Board \n(NESDB) in preparing a strategic development plan for Southern Thailand.1 A TA grant in the \namount of $300,000 has been included in ADB\u2019s 2007 assistance program for Thailand, and the \ncountry partnership strategy identifies infrastructure planning and environmentally sustainable \ndevelopment as core areas of cooperation between the Government and ADB. A fact-finding \nmission was in Southern Thailand from 31 July to 4 August 2007 and consulted with key \nstakeholders in six southern provinces. This report reflects the findings of the mission and the \nunderstandings reached with the Government and NESDB on the scope, impact, outcome, \noutputs, financing arrangements, cost, and implementation arrangements of the TA.2 The TA \ndesign and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  Thailand\u2019s 10th National Economic and Social Development Plan gives considerable \nemphasis to sustainable development. It also recognizes how much long-term growth depends \non a vibrant, competitive, and responsible industrial sector. Since the early 1980s, industrial \ninvestment  in  Thailand  has  been  concentrated  along  the  Eastern  Seaboard,  the  country\u2019s \nlargest industrial zone.3 In view of the limited carrying capacity of the Eastern Seaboard to \naccommodate further industrial development in an environmentally sustainable manner, NESDB \nhas identified Southern Thailand as a potential new export and industrial production base. \nSouthern  Thailand  is  a  region  that  is  geographically  diverse  in  economic  activity,  natural \nresources,  environmental  conditions,  population  distribution,  and  cultural  heritage.  The \nintroduction of large-scale industrial development must therefore be highly selective, sensitive to \nits potential social and environmental impact, and compatible with core economic activities in \nthe south like tourism, plantation agriculture, and fisheries. \n3.  Several planning studies for Southern Thailand, though limited to specific economic \nsectors or geographic areas, have been done over the past 10 years.4 These have proposed \nimportant initiatives, but no comprehensive regional strategy since the early 1990s.  Now poised \nto face increased development pressures, the region needs a new strategic planning framework. \nThis  framework  must  identify  appropriate  industrial  activities,  incentives  for  investment, \ninfrastructure and public service needs, a clear spatial strategy, and environmental protection \nmeasures, and it must be anchored on solid and sustainable community participation and \nsupport. \n4.  The economic issues center on three important strategic considerations. First, the types \nof industries that should be promoted in Southern Thailand must be determined; the industries \ntargeted under the 10th Plan, the views of investors in the Eastern Seaboard, and trends in \nforeign direct investment should be considered. Second, a sustainable approach to attracting \n                                                 \n1  For this TA, Southern Thailand refers to the 14 provinces of Chumpon, Krabi, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Narathiwat, \nPattani, Phangnga, Phattalung, Phuket, Ranong, Satun, Songkhla, Surat Thani, Trang, and Yala. \n2  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 September 2007.  \n3  The Eastern Seaboard comprises the three provinces of Chachoengsao, Chon Buri, and Rayong.  \n4  Including the possible introduction of an energy \u201cland bridge\u201d for transporting crude oil between the western \nAndaman Coast and the Gulf of Thailand; and ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance to the Kingdom of Thailand for \nPreparing a Development Plan for the Tsunami Affected Andaman Region. Manila (TA 4564-THA, approved on \n9 February, for $1.7 million).  ", "2   \nnew industries must be developed. To mobilize new investment, critical physical infrastructure, \nskilled labor, and economic incentives will have to be made available. Third, the economic \ndrivers of the region\u2014tourism, rubber, palm oil, and fisheries\u2014must be further optimized. These \nindustries  provide  an  important  foundation  for  diversifying  into  higher-value,  downstream \nproducts and services.  \n5.  The social issues relate, first of all, to the need to involve local people in planning, to \nfoster a sense of ownership of the plans, to cultivate support for the proposed development \nprojects, and to ensure that the new industries, as far as possible, do not adversely affect the \nenvironment,  the  communities,  and  the  quality  of  life.  Economic  development  should  also \nreduce,  and  not  worsen,  the  threatened  economic  and  social  alienation  of  the  three \npredominantly Muslim southernmost provinces of Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat. More effective \nintegration of the far south is vital for the well-being of Southern Thailand as a whole, and must \nbe a key element of any comprehensive, long-term development plan for the region. \n6.  The key environmental issue concerns the preservation of the outstanding scenery, \ntropical forests, and integrity of the western coast, with its huge potential for tourism, as well as \nthe creation of new industrial areas that blend with, rather than dominate, the natural and built \nenvironment.  Some  of  the  new  energy  plants  in  the  region,  which  are  discreet  and \nself-contained, offer important precedents in this regard. Comprehensive spatial planning that \ncombines conservation, leisure uses, and economic development through vigorous land use \nplanning controls will be essential. Examples of successful industrial planning in other countries \nwill be a useful reference point, as will important lessons in the Eastern Seaboard on the spatial, \nenvironmental, and social impact of large-scale industrialization. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA will assist NESDB in meeting the objectives of the 10th Plan by promoting the \nlong-term, sustainable, and balanced economic and social development of Southern Thailand. \nThe principal outcome will be a road map for preparing and implementing a fully comprehensive \nregional development plan for the next 20 years. This road map will be based on preliminary \nregional planning concepts, manifested in a draft preliminary structure plan, sector assessments, \nand an implementation strategy. The implementation strategy will identify the necessary actions \nthat will move the planning process forward: institutional support for the plan, an effective \nparticipatory framework for planning, more detailed studies to justify key investment decisions, \nand further plans and policies to support the development of Southern Thailand.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The  TA  will  use  various  disciplines  to  address  issues  that  are  both  common  and \ndistinctive to the subregions of Southern Thailand. Dividing the region into development zones, \neach one consisting of provinces with similar characteristics, will provide a useful analytical \nframework  for  data  collection  and  analysis,  consultations  with  key  stakeholders,  and  the \npreparation of regionally integrated planning recommendations. Ample consideration must also \nbe given to the key findings and recommendations of NESDB\u2019s ongoing planning studies for \nhigh-potential development areas and growth corridors in Thailand. As outlined below, the key \nactivities of the TA will be undertaken in four separate, yet interrelated, stages.  ", "                     3\n9.  Stage 1: Defining Needs, Constraints, and Opportunities. An overall profile will be \ndrawn up for the region and its future needs assessed, given the constraints and opportunities \nin each development zone. For this purpose, plans and policies affecting the region and the \nroles and responsibilities of government agencies (national, provincial, and local), the private \nsector, and donor agencies in planning and shaping future development will be reviewed. \nConstraints, such as poor coordination between agencies and duplication or inconsistencies in \nplanning, will be identified. The capacity of provincial and local institutions (public and private) to \nplan  and  implement  development  activities  will  be  assessed.  Special  tools  for  attracting \ninvestment, as well as existing and planned infrastructure in the region, will also be reviewed \nand likely development trends will be mapped. Careful consideration will be given to new \ninvestment and development opportunities resulting from Southern Thailand\u2019s inclusion in the \nIndonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT).5\n10.  Existing economic sectors and new industries to be redirected to Southern Thailand will \nbe reviewed. The prospects for these activities will be compared against critical needs like land, \nenergy sources, synergies (within the region and with neighboring countries), transport and \nutility  infrastructure,  human  resources,  and  investment  incentives.  From  this  analysis  the \npotential for expanding economic activities (and the likely demand for new activities) can be \ndetermined. As the scale and location of potential new development must be weighed against \nthe  region\u2019s  carrying  capacity,  the  geographic  areas  that  are  most  conducive  to  new \ndevelopment will be identified on the basis of their land use, environmental, natural resource, \nand social profile. A cluster analysis of economic activities will also include an assessment of \nlinks with neighboring countries and a review of international best practices for introducing and \nmanaging sustainable industrial development.  \n11.  Stage 2: Building Scenarios and Consulting Key Stakeholders. In this stage, key \nstakeholders, including the public, will participate in planning. The catalyst for the participation \nwill be workshops to be held in the development zones to gauge opinions, obtain comments, \nand actively involve local stakeholders in the planning process. Various government agencies, \nnongovernment  organizations,  the  private  sector,  women,  and  community  groups  will  be \nrepresented in the workshops. From the needs, opportunities, and constraints defined in stage 1, \ntwo scenarios will be presented for discussion: (i) a trend-based scenario, wherein development \nfollows current planning procedures and trends; and (ii) a balanced-growth scenario, in which \nnew development is selectively accommodated, on the basis of location criteria and potential \nimpact on the environment, natural resources, and local communities. \n12.  Feedback  on  the  different  development  scenarios  will  be  considered  in  preparing \nconcept plans for the development zones. The concept plans will fully incorporate local issues \nand concerns identified by the workshop participants. These concept plans will give rise to a \npreferred development option for the region, presenting a clear vision of what all stakeholders \naspire to in Southern Thailand. This regional development vision will, in turn, form the basis for \nthe preliminary structure plan to be prepared in stage 3. \n13.  Stage  3:  Preparing  a  Preliminary  Structure  Plan  and  Implementation  Strategy. \nBroad assessments of the primary economic sectors of the region\u2014tourism, rubber, palm oil, \ntropical fruits, fisheries, minerals, and possibly niche segments (e.g., halal foods)\u2014will indicate \ntrends in demand, as well as the potential for upgrading into higher-value, downstream products \nand services. The assessments will also show the physical and soft infrastructure needs of \n T  h  e    v i e  w  s    e  x p  r e  s  s e  d    h  e r  e i n    a  r e    those of the consultant and do not necessarily represent those of ADB\u2019s \n5m  Temheb IeMrsT,- GBTo aisr da  o\u201csf pDeicreiacl teocrosn, oMmaicn acgoeopmeeranttio, no ra sretaaf\u201df ,w aitnhdin  mwahiyc hb ec opnrceelirmteidn aanryd  isny nstaetmuraeti.c   efforts will be taken \nover the next 5 years to (i) facilitate and promote trade and investments within and between IMT-GT countries; \n(ii) promote the growth of agriculture and agro-industry and tourism; (iii) strengthen infrastructure links and support; \n(iv) address cross-sectoral concerns; and (v) strengthen institutional arrangements and mechanisms. See IMT-GT \nSecretariat and ADB. 2007. IMT-GT Roadmap (2007\u20132011). Manila. \n ", "4   \nthese sectors, to support future growth and higher value addition. In accordance with these \nbroad sector assessments, a preliminary structure plan will be prepared for the entire region. \nThis  20-year  plan  will  identify  appropriate  areas  for  land-intensive  activities  like  plantation \nagriculture  or  bio-fuel  hubs,  and  designate  possible  development  clusters  or  corridors  to \naccommodate  concentrations  of  agro-industries,  energy-based  industries,  fisheries,  tourism \ndevelopment, and so on. By also considering improved logistics through road, rail, air, and sea \ntransport infrastructure, the plan will be a blueprint guiding the nature, distribution, and intensity \nof development in the region.  \n14.  A broad strategy will be prepared to define the type of institutional support that is \nrequired to implement the structure plan. The strategy will address key actions needed to \nfacilitate the growth of sectors identified for expansion, using as a starting point the existing, \nongoing,  and  committed  infrastructure  investments  in  Southern  Thailand.  Economic  and \nadministrative incentives will be recommended to attract new industries and bolster existing \nones (particularly by facilitating higher-value-added production). Crucial to the implementation \nstrategy will be proposals to organize effective land use management and development controls \nin  and  around  designated  growth  areas.  These  controls  will  allow  the  region  to  remain  a \nhigh-quality leisure and tourist destination, and a desirable place to work and live, even as \nlarge-scale industrial development is introduced. \n15.  Stage 4: Defining a Road Map for Implementing a Regional Development Plan. \nWith the preliminary structure plan, the initial planning recommendations can be further justified \nand strengthened into a robust and comprehensive regional development plan. More detailed \nstudies will have to be done to prepare targeted strategies for the key economic sectors, and \nsituate the strategies. For a properly phased and spatially integrated regional development plan \nwith definitive infrastructure and land use recommendations, more detailed plans will also have \nto  be  prepared  for  each  development  zone.  The  Sub-regional  Development  Plan  for  the \nTsunami Affected Andaman Region can guide such planning. There may also be a need to \nprepare more detailed and updated local plans to accommodate special economic zones or the \nintroduction of new infrastructure in sensitive areas. The work required to refine the structure \nplan and to strengthen it with supporting plans in key areas will be spelled out in the road map \nfor comprehensive regional development planning for Southern Thailand. \nC.  Cost and Financing \n16.  The total cost of the TA is estimated to be $400,000 equivalent, of which $300,000 will \nbe funded on a grant basis from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. The Government will finance the \nremaining $100,000 equivalent in kind, with counterpart and other support facilities and services. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n17.  NESDB will be the Executing Agency (EA) for the TA, and its Infrastructure Project \nOffice (IPO) and Competitiveness Development Office (CDO) will be the primary Implementing \nAgencies (IAs). NESDB\u2019s internal committee for Southern Thailand and dedicated project team, \ncomprising  representatives  from  other  government  ministries  and  agencies,  will  provide \ncomments, suggestions, and guidance at different stages of the TA implementation. Inception, \ninterim, draft final, and final reports will be submitted to ADB, the IAs, and the secretary-general \nof NESDB for guidance and necessary action. IPO and CDO will each appoint a project director \nto assist with the daily implementation of the TA, and manage the provision of counterpart staff \nand other support services required by the consultants. To facilitate data collection and the ", "                     5\nconduct of the consultation workshops, NESDB intends to field a team of national consultants \nand engage the services of universities from Southern Thailand. \n18.  The TA will require 11 person-months of international consultant inputs over 7 months, \nfrom February to August 2008. The consulting services will be provided by a team of four \ninternational  consultants:  (i)  a  team  leader/regional  planner  (3.5  person-months),  (ii) an \ninfrastructure/industry  specialist  (3  person-months),  (iii)  a  land  use/environmental  planner \n(2.5 person-months),  and  (iv)  a  human  resources/social  development  specialist \n(2 person-months). To ensure that the experts are of high caliber, have worked previously in \nThailand, and meet the Government\u2019s expectations, the consultants will be recruited individually, \nrather than through a firm, and will be hired by ADB according to its Guidelines on the Use of \nConsultants (2007, as amended from time to time). Outline terms of reference are in Appendix 3. \n19.  NESDB will provide office space within its premises to enable the international and \nnational consultants to work together as a team in close coordination with IPO and CDO staff. \nWithin 2 weeks of mobilization, the consultants will prepare an inception report, which will \ninclude a detailed work plan and a schedule of deliverables agreed on with ADB and the IAs. \nInterim reports will be submitted within the deadlines specified in the work plan. The draft final \nreport will incorporate feedback from the EA, IAs, other relevant offices and agencies, and ADB. \nTo solicit input from other stakeholders, consultation workshops will be held in each of the \ndevelopment zones over the implementation period. To further facilitate the dissemination of the \nTA findings and recommendations, the final report will be provided both in hard copy and in \nelectronic format. An indicative outline for the final report is in Appendix 4. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n20.
