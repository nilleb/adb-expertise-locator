THE PROPOSAL \n \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan to \nthe Republic of the Philippines for the Second Health System Enhancement to Address and Limit \nCOVID-19 under the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (HEAL 2).   \n2.  Under the rapid response component (RRC) of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \n(APVAX), HEAL 2 will provide the Government of the Philippines with timely financing for safe \nand effective vaccine procurement and logistics, based on an agreed list of eligible expenditures. \nIt will supplement the initial support of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to the government\u2019s \ncoronavirus disease (COVID-19) response under the Health System Enhancement to Address \nand Limit COVID-19 (HEAL) project.1 It will be jointly supported by the Asian Infrastructure \n0F\nInvestment Bank (AIIB). HEAL 2 is aligned with three operational priorities of ADB's Strategy \n2030: (i) addressing remaining poverty and reducing inequalities; (ii) accelerating progress in \ngender equality; and (iii) fostering regional cooperation and integration.2  \n1F\n3.  The Philippines has met all APVAX access criteria by (i) demonstrating the adverse impact \nof the COVID-19 pandemic; (ii) completing a needs assessment and a vaccination allocation and \nprioritization plan, including an incremental medical waste management plan and procurement \narrangements  acceptable  to  ADB,  with  ADB\u2019s  receipt  of  a  Governor\u2019s  letter  confirming  its \ncommitment to implement the plan and ensure compliance with the APVAX vaccine eligibility \ncriteria;3 and (iii) establishing an effective development partner coordination mechanism with a \n2F\nclear role for ADB (Table 1).   \nTable 1: Compliance with Access Criteria of the Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility \nAccess Criteria  ADB Staff Assessment \n1.  Demonstrated adverse  In 2020, gross domestic product contracted by 9.5% because of COVID-19, and \nimpact of COVID-19  the proportion of families experiencing moderate to severe hunger at least once \nin the prior 3 months reached a record high of 30.7%. Unemployment also soared \nto a record 17.7% by April 2020 and remained high at 8.7% by October 2020. \nSeveral sectors of the economy may face serious challenges to recover back to \nthe pre-pandemic levels. \n2.  Completed needs  The government has used WHO\u2019s Vaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment \nassessment  Tool and other tools to complete a needs assessment that identified gaps in cold \nchain  and  distribution  systems,  the  VIMS,  communications,  and  safety \nsurveillance.  The  government  has  addressed  deficiencies  in  the  areas  of \ncommunications and surveillance, and is completing the procurement of the VIMS \nand third-party logistics firms to fill the gaps in cold chain and distribution, and \ntracking of vaccines and vaccinated people.    \nNational vaccination  Based on the National COVID-19 Vaccine Roadmap, the Inter-Agency Task Force \nallocation plan   for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases approved the National \nDeployment and Vaccination Plan for COVID-19 Vaccines on 21 January 2021. \nThe plan details financing and implementation steps for vaccinating up to 70 \nmillion Filipinos in 2021. It includes a prioritization plan, which lists health workers \nand the elderly first and is aligned with the values framework for COVID-19 \nvaccine allocation of WHO\u2019s SAGE. \nIncremental medical waste  DOH, with support from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, \nmanagement plan  will contract a third-party reverse logistics firm for the transport, storage, and \ndisposal of used vaccine vials, syringes, and related waste. A Health Care Waste \nManagement Framework and health care waste management manual, which were \nupdated in 2020, will guide the on-site management of vaccination waste. \n \n1  ADB. 2021.

THE PROJECT \nA.  Rationale \n4.  Status of the pandemic in the Philippines. The Philippines recorded its first case of \nCOVID-19 on 30 January 2020, and the first case of local transmission on 7 March 2020.4 Given \n3F\nthe threat of COVID-19 to national security, a State of Public Health Emergency was declared on \n8 March 2020 through Proclamation No. 922, and the National Capital Region was placed under \ngeneral  community  quarantine  on  15  March  2020.5  This  was  escalated  to  an  enhanced \n4F\ncommunity quarantine for the whole of Luzon on 16 March 2020 to mitigate the spread of the \nvirus. On 16 May 2020, the government started to relax the quarantines and the associated \nnonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)6 because of the observed stabilization of the number of \n5F\nnew cases.7 However, new cases started to rapidly emerge again by July 2020.    \n6F\n5.  The rapid surge prompted a re-imposition of stricter quarantine measures and NPIs by \nAugust 2020. As a result, the weekly increases in new COVID-19 cases were reduced from a \npeak of 23,019 during 6\u201312 August 2020 to 9,203 during 17\u201323 December 2020. The daily \npositivity rate\u2014the share of individuals tested and confirmed positive in the total number of \nindividuals tested\u2014dropped from 12.7% on 1 August 2020 to 6.5% on 29 December 2020.8  \n7F\nAlthough the NPIs are driving down the number of cases, the risk of rapid spikes in new cases, \nsimilar to those in July 2020, remains. The new coronavirus variants, which have been observed \nto be more contagious, add to this risk. The introduction of COVID-19 vaccination is highly critical \nto lowering the number of new cases and bringing an end to the pandemic. \n6.  Cost to the economy. The COVID-19 pandemic drove the Philippine economy into \nrecession for the first time since the 1998 Asian financial crisis\u2014its gross domestic product (GDP) \nfor the full year of 2020 contracted by 9.5%.9 Because of the quarantines, unemployment soared \n8F\nto a record high of 17.7% by April 2020, but came down to 8.7% by October 2020.10 The adverse \n9F\nimpact  on  employment  has  been  the  greatest  in  services,  particularly  in  contact-intensive \n \n4   World Health Organization (WHO).

Impact  on  poor  and  vulnerable  groups.  The  proportion  of  families  experiencing \nmoderate to severe hunger at least once in the prior 3 months had risen from 9.3% in 2019 to a \nrecord  30.7% in September 2020, affecting an estimated 7.7 million households.11 Income losses \n10F\nfor millions of poor families,12 particularly those who are unemployed or in vulnerable employment \n11F\n(about 34% among the employed people), became prevalent in industry (particularly construction) \nand services (especially transportation, accommodation, and food service activities) as a result \nof the increase in unemployment rates.13  \n12F\n8.  Impact on gender. COVID-19 has exacerbated inequalities between women and men in \nterms of livelihoods and economic empowerment, personal safety and security, and responsibility \nfor household care roles. More women (77%) are employed in crisis-affected service sectors \n(tourism, accommodation, food services, and other service-based livelihoods) than men (47%).14 \n13F\nUnder COVID-19 situation, intimate partner violence rates are very likely to have increased, in \nline with global trends reported\u2014the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia \nand the Pacific reported 30\u201350% increase in women calling dedicated gender-based violence \nhotlines during 2020.15 COVID-19 also affects mental health: reported cases of anxiety and \n14F\ndepression have increased,16 and women suffer particularly because of their heightened burden \n15F\nof care and risk management.   \n9.  Impact on the health system. The pandemic has impacted the health care system by \nexposing health workers to COVID-19 and overwhelming the bed occupancy levels of health \nfacilities, especially critical care beds. As the identification and treatment of COVID-19 cases \nbecame a priority, the public's access to health services for non-COVID-19 conditions decreased:  \nthe fear of infection led people (including women, pregnant women, new mothers, and people \nwith  chronic  diseases)  to  avoid  going  to  health  care  providers.  Routine  immunizations, \ntuberculosis and HIV services, and sexual and reproductive health services, for instance, were \ndisrupted, which intensified morbidity and mortality17\u2014maternal deaths are estimated to have \n16F\nincreased by 26% in 2020.18 COVID-19 has severely affected the elderly, especially those 60 \n17F\nyears and older accounting for 62% of all deaths (footnote 8).  \n10.  All these impacts starkly highlight the need for urgent COVID-19 vaccination. However, \nthe limited global supply of and access to safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines are exacerbated \nby the increasing number of supply agreements reached by high-income countries with vaccine \nsuppliers. Decisions on which vaccines to procure need to consider evaluate the various vaccine \n \n11  Social  Weather  Stations.  2020.  Hunger  at  new  record-high  30.7%  of  families.

Gaps identified in vaccine delivery also need to be \naddressed. To meet these challenges, the Philippines adopted a whole-of-government approach \nto securing and delivering safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines. The government organized a \nCOVID-19 Vaccine Cluster under the Inter-agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging \nInfectious Diseases (IATF) and developed the National COVID-19 Vaccine Roadmap, followed \nby the preparation of the National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for COVID-19 Vaccines \n(NDVP).  \n11.  Needs assessment. A needs assessment20 has been completed. The needs assessment \n19F\nwas informed by the monthly application of the Vaccine Introduction Readiness Assessment Tool \nfrom October 2020 to January 2021, which identified gaps in cold chain and distribution capacity, \nvaccine  management  information,  communications,  and  safety  surveillance.  Gaps  in \ncommunications and safety surveillance were addressed; others including procurement of a \nvaccine information management system (VIMS) are being dealt with at present, with a view to \nachieving completion by March 2021.21  \n20F\n12.  National COVID-19 Vaccine Roadmap. The roadmap defines the key considerations for \nthe selection of vaccines (e.g., safety, efficacy, sensitivity, supply, and cold chain requirement), \nthe  process  and  stages  of  vaccination  from  scientific  evaluation  to  monitoring  and  safety \nsurveillance, and the desired end-state of COVID-19 vaccination. It sets out a prioritization plan \nin line with the guidance from the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) \nof the World Health Organization (WHO).  \n13.  Prioritization  and  allocation  plan.  The  national  government  has  increased  its \nvaccination targets and plans to vaccinate up to 70 million Filipinos in 2021, and all Filipinos by \n2023, with most of the population covered by the end of 2022 (Table 2). It plans to secure up to \n148 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, including free doses from the COVID-19 Vaccines \nGlobal Access (COVAX) facility for up to 20% of the eligible population and doses from bilateral \narrangements with vaccine suppliers. The government's prioritization and allocation plan (footnote \n3) defines target groups, priorities, and eligibility for the vaccination program in line with SAGE \nand the country context. Group A, the first target group (estimated at 24.7 million or 23% of the \ntotal  population),  prioritizes  frontline  health  workers,  senior  citizens,  people  with  medical \nconditions, indigent populations, and uniformed personnel. Group B (up to 44% of the total \npopulation) covers teachers and social workers; other government workers (national and local); \nother essential workers outside health, education, and social sectors; socio-demographic groups \nat significant risk other than senior citizens and indigent populations (people with disability, \npersons deprived of liberty, people living in high-density areas); overseas Filipino workers; and \nthe remaining Filipino workforce. Group C covers all people not included in Group A or Group B. \n \n \n19  At least six different technology platforms are used in the development of COVID-19 vaccines, and all employ or \nproduce coronavirus spike proteins to generate immunity to future infections. The most common platforms are \nnucleic acid technologies used in messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines (e.g., Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines), \nnon-replicating viral vector vaccines (e.g., AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines), recombinant \nprotein vaccines (e.g., Novavax vaccine), and inactivated virus vaccines (e.g., Bharat, Sinopharm, Sinovac \nvaccines). \n20  Vaccine Needs Assessment (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n21  ADB\u2019s Assessment of the COVID-19 Vaccine Introduction Readiness (accessible from the list of linked documents \n \nin Appendix 2).\n \n ", " \n5 \nTable 2: Vaccine Allocation Plan for the Philippines, 2021\u20132023  \nVaccine Access  2021  2022  2023 \nEligible Population  Eligible Population  Eligible Population \nNumber  % of total  Number  % of total  Number  % of total \n(million)  population  (million)  population  (million)  population \nTarget  Current year  70  63%  42  37%  2  2% \nPrevious year's       70  63%  112  98% \nTotal population  70  63%  112  100%  114  100% \nSource: Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases.

To ensure that only safe and effective vaccines are selected for \nvaccination, only those recommended by the Technical Group on Scientific Evaluation and \nSelection  will  be  considered  for  procurement  by  the  government.22  The  Food  and  Drug \n21F\nAdministration  (FDA)  of  the  Philippines  has  been  empowered  to  issue  emergency  use \nauthorizations (EUAs) for COVID-19 drugs and vaccines23 with EUAs already issued to Pfizer-\n22F\nBioNTech vaccine on 14 January 2021 and to AstraZeneca vaccine on 28 January 2021. \n15.  Financing need and expenditure program. The government\u2019s participation in COVAX \nwill allow it to access vaccines for at least 20% of its population.24 Only about 5.6 million doses \n23F\nhave an indicative delivery schedule.25 Given its plan to provide vaccines to up to 70 million or \n24F\nabout 63% of the country\u2019s population in 2021, the government estimates that it needs about \n\u20b182.5 billion (about $1.70 billion) for 2021. Of this amount, \u20b112.5 billion (about $260 million) has \nbeen allocated from its own resources and the remaining \u20b170.0 billion (about $1.45 billion) is \nexpected to be secured through loans from multilateral lenders, bilateral partners, and/or other \nsources (Table 3).26 The government estimates that 84.5% will be spent on the procurement of \n25F\nvaccines,  and  the  remainder  on  related  items  (e.g.,  logistics,  vaccine  campaign,  risk \ncommunications, and monitoring). The procurement of vaccines will be financed primarily by \nmultilateral agencies and secondarily through bilateral arrangements and government financial \ninstitutions (i.e., Land Bank of the Philippines and Development Bank of the Philippines). The \ngovernment will finance the procurement of logistics and other needs through the \u20b12.5 billion \n($52.0 million) general appropriations to DOH and the \u20b110 billion ($208.1 million) continuing \nappropriation under the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act (Bayanihan 2).27  \n26F\n \nTable 3: COVID-19 Vaccine Program Financing  \nFinancing Need  Amount   Source of Financing  \n($ million) \nVaccines  1,456.51  Unprogrammed funds: multilateral / bilateral loans and domestic loans \nLogistics and other supplies  260.09  20% or $52.0 million from DOH GAA 2021 \n80% or $208.1 million from Bayanihan 2 continuing appropriations \n \n22  The Technical Group on Scientific Evaluation and Selection, which evaluates COVID-19 vaccine candidates, \nincludes the following members: DOH, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Research Institute for Tropical \nMedicine, Department of Trade and Industry, Department of Foreign Affairs, National Development Company, and \nthe Vaccine Expert Panel.

Vaccine options. The government will access vaccines through the COVAX facility and \npotential bilateral arrangements with vaccine suppliers such as Pfizer-BioNTech, AstraZeneca, \nModerna, Gamaleya, Johnson & Johnson, the Serum Institute of India for the Novavax-developed \nvaccine,  and  Sinovac.  Pfizer-BioNTech,  AstraZeneca,  and  Moderna  vaccines  have  already \nreceived EUAs from a stringent regulatory authority (SRA). As of 17 February 2021, Pfizer-\nBioNTech vaccines and AstraZeneca vaccines manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and \nSK Bioscience of the Republic of Korea were also included in the emergency use listing of the \nWHO.28 \n27F\n \n17.  Tripartite arrangements. To expand the supply of vaccines, the government developed \ntripartite arrangements between the national government, the vaccine supplier, and the private \nsector or local government units (LGUs). Under this arrangement, the private sector or LGUs will \npurchase and then consign vaccines to the national government. Distribution will be based on the \ngovernment\u2019s prioritization plan and in coordination with the private sector purchasers or LGUs. \nThe implementation guidelines are still being finalized, with around half of the privately purchased \nvaccines  expected to  be  provided to  DOH,  and  all  the  LGU-purchased  vaccines  to  those \ndesignated by the LGUs. In both cases, the vaccines will be administered in accordance with the \ngovernment\u2019s prioritization plan.    \n18.  Deployment and vaccination plan. The government\u2019s NDVP details actions to address \ngaps and to supplement the government\u2019s cold chain storage and logistics capacity. The DOH \nexpects to complete engagement of a third-party private logistics firm by the end of February 2021. \nTo strengthen the tracking of vaccines and those who have been vaccinated, the Department of \nInformation Communications and Technology is urgently engaging a firm to design, develop, and \nmanage an electronic VIMS that will interconnect DOH, LGUs, and private sector information systems. \nThe VIMS is expected to be operational by March 2021. Acknowledging potential delays in the \ncontracting of these two firms, the government\u2019s contingency plan is to use DOH\u2019s existing central \nand regional vaccine warehouses. It will contract a private forwarding firm to help distribute all types \nof DOH goods (such as medicines and family planning commodities) to LGUs, and the DOH-\ndeveloped COVID-19 electronic immunization registry to support the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines \nuntil the privately provided solutions are operational. These contingencies are expected to be \nadequate  to  help  manage  the  initial  limited  vaccine  deliveries  until  June  2021.  Vaccine \ncommunications are being scaled up with private sector support through near-daily townhalls with \ndoctors, other health workers, and other sectors involved. Safety surveillance is being enhanced with \nthe  development  of  guidelines  and  training  modules  for  reporting  adverse  events  following \nimmunization, and the setting up of VIMS for COVID-19 vaccines.  \n19.  The NDVP also defines the institutional arrangements, roles, and responsibilities at DOH, \nother agencies of the central government, and LGUs. LGUs will continue to administer most of \nthe vaccines, as they have usually done with all government-provided vaccines. They are now \npreparing master lists; profiling, screening, and registering their residents; and determining their \npriority populations. LGUs are scaling up their vaccine workforce, mapping vaccination sites, and \npreparing local plans. In parallel, hospitals are preparing plans to vaccinate their staff. DOH is \n \n28 WHO.

Waste management. A Health Care Waste Management Framework and an updated \nmanual are in place, and on-site management of immunization waste will be implemented. The \nDOH, with support from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), is \nexpected to contract a third-party reverse logistics firm for the transport, storage, and disposal of \nused vaccine vials, syringes, and related waste.  \n21.  Effective  development  coordination  and  ADB\u2019s  role.30  Development  partner \n29F\ncoordination on COVID-19 vaccination is carried out at two levels. First, the Department of \nFinance chairs the development partners\u2019 COVID-19 working group on vaccine financing, which \ncomprises DOH, WHO, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), ADB, AIIB, the World \nBank, and Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The working group \nmeets  regularly  to  discuss  policy  and  technical  issues  related  to  vaccine  financing  and \nprocurement. Second, DOH has set up a development partners\u2019 technical working group on \nCOVID-19 vaccination. The DOH\u2019s Bureau of International Health Cooperation coordinates with \nseveral development partners, including Japan International Cooperation Agency and United \nStates Agency for International Development, and integrates partner contributions into a common \nresults framework and operational plan. This involves regular meetings among development \npartners to coordinate work on various aspects of accessing and delivering safe and effective \nCOVID-19 vaccines.  \n22.  Government request. The government, through the Department of Finance, requested \nADB to support its COVID-19 vaccination program. It sought financing for advance payment and \nadvance market commitments for COVID-19 vaccines totaling $25 million from the ongoing HEAL \nproject,31 and a new loan of $400 million to procure safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines for its \n30F\ntarget groups (para. 13). Similarly, the government requested from AIIB a loan in the amount of \n$300 million for joint cofinancing of the proposed HEAL 2. In addition, the government has also \nrequested a loan in the amount of $500 million from the World Bank for vaccine procurement.32 \n31F\nB.  Project Description \n23.  Impact and outcome. HEAL 2 will align with the following impacts: (i) health system \nperformance in addressing public health outbreaks improved;33 (ii) protection of the public and \n32F\nreduction of COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality fostered;34 and (iii) economic growth and \n33F\ncitizens\u2019 confidence restored.35 It will have the following outcome: priority populations vaccinated \n34F\nagainst COVID-19.36 \n35F\n \n29  DOH Undersecretary Myrna Cabotaje\u2019s presentation on vaccine deployment updates. 1 February 2021.

Output: COVID-19 vaccines efficiently and effectively delivered. The project will \nsupport the procurement of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 through APVAX\u2019s RRC \nin compliance with ADB\u2019s vaccine eligibility criteria and with AIIB cofinancing. It will procure a total \nof up to 110 million doses of vaccines,37 which will be administered to up to 50 million Filipinos by \n36F\n2024 based on identified priority populations. The eligible vaccines will be procured through either \nthe COVAX facility or bilateral arrangements with vaccine manufacturers or distributors. The \nvaccines are expected to be introduced swiftly to priority populations following the NDVP, and \naccording to vaccination protocols and standards, such as those governing waste management \nand monitoring of adverse events. With the help of ongoing technical assistance,38 the project \n37F\nteam will support the VIMS and DOH's communication management and help develop and \ndisseminate a gender- and socially- inclusive protocol to support last-mile vaccine outreach to \nmarginalized women and women in especially difficult circumstances (WEDC).  \nC.  Value Added by ADB  \n25.   ADB\u2019s support to the Philippines\u2019 health sector since 1994 underscored the need to (i) \nsupport the country\u2019s decentralized health system and its institutional arrangements for local \nhealth service delivery; and (ii) include public financial management support to strengthen project \nimplementation, performance, and governance. ADB, under its COVID-19 Active Response and \nExpenditure Support (CARES) program, approved on 23 April 2020 a $1.5 billion countercyclical \nsupport for the Philippines to help the government mitigate the severe health, social, and \neconomic impacts of COVID-19. ADB supported the health sector in managing COVID-19 through \na $125 million loan under HEAL, a $3.0 million grant for the COVID-19 Emergency Response, \nand $5.0 million in technical assistance for the provision of emergency supplies.39 \n38F\n26.  HEAL 2 builds on and complements HEAL, which provides $25 million initial support to \nthe government\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination program and strengthens DOH capacity to detect, \ncontain, and treat COVID-19 cases (footnote 1). It complements ADB\u2019s ongoing and planned \nsupport for universal health care, including a project planned for approval in 2021. ADB will assist \nthe government and DOH with procurement and delivery of certified vaccines in line with APVAX \neligibility criteria. It will support ensuring vaccine introduction readiness together with UNICEF \nand WHO.  \n27.  In addition, technical assistance (footnote 38) will help the government to (i) determine \nsuitable quantity, timing, and procurement arrangements for eligible vaccines; (ii) monitor the \nimplementation of its prioritization plan; (iii) strengthen the implementation of its medical waste \nmanagement program; (iv) support gender mainstreaming through activities in the gender action \nplan; and (v) continuously monitor and evaluate the implementation of COVID-19 vaccination, \nincluding using the VIMS, to track adverse events after vaccination, disseminate the data and \nexperience within the country as well as the region. It will help the future expansion of other \nneeded vaccinations such as influenza vaccinations for the elderly and people with disabilities. \n \n37  This is expected to include 44 million doses from the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access (COVAX) whose cost-\nshare will be financed by the project, and 6 million single doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The estimated \ncoverage of up to 50 million Filipinos assumes a wastage rate of 10%. \n38  ADB. 2020.

Summary Cost Estimates and Financing Plan \n28.  HEAL 2 is estimated to cost $764.17 million. The summary cost estimates are in Table 4. \nADB will finance expenditures in relation to the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines that meet the \nAPVAX eligibility criteria. The project team will be guided by the Indicative Master List of Eligible \nItems and Agreed List of Acceptable Expenditure Items (\u2018Positive List\u2019) for ADB financing.40   \n39F\n29.  The government has requested a regular loan of $400 million from ADB\u2019s ordinary capital \nresources under the APVAX RRC, and a loan of $300 million from AIIB. The loan from ADB will \nhave a 10-year term including a grace period of 3 years; an annual interest rate determined in \naccordance  with  ADB\u2019s  London  interbank  offered  rate  (LIBOR)-based  lending  facility;  a \ncommitment charge of 0.15% per year; and such other terms and conditions set forth in the draft \nloan agreement. The government has made its independent decision to borrow under ADB\u2019s \nLIBOR-based lending facility and has given an undertaking that this was not made on the basis \nof any advice from ADB.  \n30.  The AIIB loan will be partially administered by ADB. It will jointly finance supply contracts \nfor vaccines that meet the eligibility criteria under the APVAX.41 Its terms and conditions will be \n40F\ndescribed in a loan agreement between AIIB and the government.42 Approval of the AIIB loan is \n41F\nexpected after ADB\u2019s Board approval of HEAL 2. Prior to the effectiveness of the AIIB loan, the \ngovernment may request advances from the ADB loan proceeds. Subsequent disbursements \nfollowing AIIB loan effectiveness will be prorated. \n31.  The government will contribute $64.17 million, or 8.4% of the total project cost, to cover \n$12.1 million of loan interest and charges and $52.07 million for other vaccine costs, including \ninjection devices, personal protective equipment, vaccine transportation, storage, waste disposal, \nand surveillance.

The financial assistance from ADB and AIIB will add only 0.3% (ADB) and 0.2% (AIIB) to \nthe public debt stock and will not significantly affect the debt\u2013GDP ratio and annual debt service \nobligations. The ADB and AIIB loans jointly will raise the public debt\u2013GDP ratio marginally above \nthe baseline scenario, to 49.1% in 2020 and to 58.4% by 2024. ADB\u2019s debt sustainability analysis \nconcluded that even with the additional loans, the debt\u2013GDP ratio will remain sustainable.43  \n42F\nE.    Implementation Arrangements \n33.  The DOH will be the executing agency. It will set up a project management team (PMT) \nwith a project director and a project manager. A technical support unit of individual consultants \n(health experts, a gender specialist, a financial management specialist, a procurement specialist, \nand administration staff) will be engaged to assist the PMT.  \n34.  Procurement will be undertaken in a manner consistent with simplified and expedient \nprocedures permitted under the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) \nand Procurement Regulations for ADB Borrowers (2017, as amended from time to time). Since \nHEAL 2 will be financed under the APVAX, ADB member country eligibility restrictions will be \nwaived, and universal procurement will apply. Majority of procurement will be jointly cofinanced \nwith AIIB; ADB will be the lead cofinancier and its procurement policy will apply to all procurement. \nSome procurement may be financed exclusively by ADB.   \n35.  A proportion of the vaccines will be procured through the COVAX facility. COVAX facility-\nprovided vaccines are eligible expenditures under APVAX. The DOH will also directly negotiate \nwith vaccine manufacturers to agree on bilateral contracts. Prior to being confirmed as an eligible \nexpenditure under the loan, ADB will review the vaccine eligibility criteria and all bilateral vaccine \nagreements to ensure that the terms are acceptable to ADB. Value for money in procurement will \nbe achieved through (i) selecting candidate vaccine types that are best suited to the domestic \nlogistics supply chain and distribution mechanisms; (ii) identifying vaccines that will meet the \nproject disbursement  conditions; (iii) engaging with manufacturers who have advantageous \nvaccine availability and delivery timelines, and (iv) entering into agreements on terms and \nconditions that are reasonable, noting the currently constrained global market for vaccines. Taking \ninto account the global supply situation of vaccines, the Philippines\u2019 legal restriction on financing \nadvance payments, and the urgency for the government to secure vaccines, ADB will finance the \ngovernment\u2019s first 10% advance payment to the Serum Institute of India (SII) for the purchase of \nCovovax, the Novavax vaccine manufactured by SII, under the supply agreement between the \ngovernment and SII, notwithstanding that Covovax does not currently satisfy APVAX\u2019s vaccine \neligibility criteria. If Covovax fails to satisfy APVAX\u2019s vaccine eligibility criteria by 31 December \n2021, or such other date agreed with ADB, the government will repay the 10% advance payment \nin accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. Notwithstanding the above, in the event that \nCovovax fails to satisfy the eligibility criteria, and the government secures a refund of all or any \n \n43  Debt Sustainability Analysis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 2). \n \n ", " \n11 \npart of the 10% advance payment, the government will refund ADB such amount within 30 days \nof the government\u2019s receipt of the refund, without giving effect to the term of repayment set forth \nin the loan agreement. This proposal is justified on the basis of an ongoing discussion by COVAX \nto sign an advance purchase agreement (APA) with SII for Covovax and SII\u2019s anticipated \napplication for emergency use listing (EUL) to WHO for Covovax.  It is further justified as SII is \nthe world\u2019s largest vaccine manufacturer in terms of the number of doses produced for 28 WHO \nprequalified vaccines; its manufacturing facilities are certified as operating under current the Good \nManufacturing Practices (GMP) by WHO; and the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by SII \n(Covishield) has been authorized by Health Canada, the SRA of Canada. ADB\u2019s financing of the \nsecond advance payment under the supply agreement will be subject to Covovax satisfying \nAPVAX\u2019s vaccine eligibility criteria. ADB\u2019s financing of the third payment will be subject to \nCovovax continuing to satisfy APVAX\u2019s vaccine eligibility criteria, and Covovax additionally \nreceiving the Philippines FDA authorization, consistent with the loan disbursement conditions for \nother vaccines (para. 51).    \n36.

The COVID-19 pandemic is both a health and an economic crisis, which resulted in loss \nof lives, an increase in morbidity, and a slowdown of the economy. Containment measures have \nrestricted economic activities, and substantially affected investments and international trade.

Sustainability \n \n38.  The government\u2019s target is to vaccinate up to 70 million Filipinos in 2021 and all Filipinos \nby 2023. The government has allocated a total of  \u20b182.5 billion to implement the national \nvaccination program (para.15). However, given that vaccine supply contracts are still being \nnegotiated, it is difficult to determine whether the appropriation would be adequate to achieve the \nvaccination targets. Moreover, the full funding requirements for logistics, cold chain facilities, \ntransport services, and the VIMS are still being finalized. To supplement potential funding gap, \nthe government is mobilizing financing from the private sector and LGUs.  \n \nC.  Governance  \n \n39.  A  financial  management  assessment  was  conducted  to  evaluate  the  financial \nmanagement capacity of the DOH to implement the project. An assessment was also conducted \non the national vaccination plan in the areas of inventory management, data management, \naccounting, oversight, and audit. Based on the assessment, the pre-mitigation risk is rated high \nbecause  of  the scale and  complexity  of  the project.  The  DOH  has  agreed  on  a  financial \nmanagement action plan to address deficiencies in the deployment plan and mitigate the risks by \n(i) completing  an  assessment  of  LGUs\u2019  capacity  to  oversee  vaccine  deployment  prior  to \ndistribution; (ii) setting up an asset register of cold chain facilities; (iii) engaging a third party-\nlogistics  provider;  (iv)  formulating  a  contingency  plan  for  funding;  (v) updating  inventory \nmanagement protocols; and (vi) having Commission on Audit conduct performance, financial, and \ncompliance audits with assistance from ADB.45  \n44F\n \n40.  ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) was explained to and discussed \nwith  the  government  and  the  DOH.  The  specific  policy  requirements  and  supplementary \nmeasures are described in the project administration manual.46 \n45F\nD.  Poverty, Social, and Gender \n41.  Poverty and social. The poverty rate in the Philippines fell from 25.2% in 2012 to 23.5% \nin 2015, and to 16.7% in 2018. Despite this decline, the absolute level of poverty and inequality \nremains high. Nearly 17.6 million people continue to live below the poverty line, and 14.2 million \nlive just above the line and are vulnerable to sliding back into poverty because of exogenous \nshocks.47  Because  of  the  adverse  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  community \n46F\nquarantines (paras. 6\u20139), the unemployment rate increased from 5.4% (2.4 million) to 10.0% (4.6 \nmillion) between July 2019 and July 2020, while underemployment increased from 13.6% (5.8 \nmillion) to 17.3% (7.1 million) in the same period.

Gender. While most of the priority population groups for vaccination are dominated by \nwomen,49 many marginalized women, WEDC (footnote 18), and women in geographically isolated \n48F\nand  disadvantaged  areas  face  significant  barriers  to  accessing  COVID-19  health  support, \nincluding vaccines. The barriers for marginalized women and WEDC include (i) limited time to \nspend commuting to and waiting in long lines at public health facilities that are stretched beyond \ncapacity; (ii) mobility constraints such as cultural norms governing freedom of movement; (iii) \nlimited access to public transportation to reach health facilities; and (iv) the costs associated with \nthe commute, and time away from productive and household responsibilities. The DOH has \nexpressed concerns that its definition of \"social demographic groups at higher risk\" may not be \nsufficiently comprehensive to ensure the last-mile outreach between LGU primary health care \nfacilities and vaccine delivery to marginalized women and WEDC. The DOH also acknowledges \nthe essential role of information, education, and communication campaigns; risk communication; \nand community engagement to ensure effective vaccine access and uptake. \n \n43.  HEAL 2 is categorized as effective gender mainstreaming. Through ongoing technical \nassistance (footnote 38), the project will make sure to minimize the last-mile service delivery \nconstraints for marginalized women and WEDC, to maximize vaccine uptake and immunization. \nHEAL 2 will help DOH develop, approve, and disseminate a gender- and socially-inclusive \nprotocol to reduce the barriers that now hamper both the willingness and ability of marginalized \nwomen and WEDC to access COVID-19 health services and vaccines, and to improve the \ncapacity of LGUs\u2019 primary health care facilities to meet the specific needs of these women for \neffective vaccine delivery. The protocol will be developed in collaboration with multiple DOH \nbureaus and other government departments and be resourced via LGU gender and development \nprogram budgets. In addition, HEAL 2 will support DOH in (i) the analysis of sex-disaggregated \ndata through the VIMS; (ii) specific communication and messaging to marginalized women and \nWEDC in major cities or geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas; and (iii) online \nconsultations and outreach, especially to marginalized and WEDC, to monitor their awareness of \nvaccine safety and gather feedback on issues that curtail access to health services. A gender \nconsultant will be recruited to support DOH's gender activities. \n \nE.  Safeguards \n44.  In compliance with ADB\u2019s Safeguard Policy Statement (2009), the project\u2019s safeguard \ncategories are as follows.50 \n49F\n45.  Environment (category C). HEAL 2 will support the procurement of vaccines and will not \nentail  civil  works  or  other  activities  with  potential  for  significant  adverse  impacts  on  the \nenvironment. The distribution and use of COVID-19 vaccines will result in a temporary increase \nin  immunization  waste  generation.51  The  NDVP  defines  immunization  waste  management \n50F\n \n48 ADB. 2020.

The movement of immunization \nwaste offsite will comply with DENR's licensing, reporting, and monitoring rules through the \nexisting Hazardous Waste Manifest System.  \n46.  Involuntary resettlement (category C). HEAL 2 will not require any land acquisition or \nlead to any resettlement impacts.  \n \n47.  Indigenous peoples (category C). HEAL 2 is not expected to have any direct or indirect \nimpacts on the dignity, human rights, livelihood systems, or culture of indigenous peoples, or the \nterritories or natural or cultural resources that indigenous peoples own, use, occupy, or claim as \nan ancestral domain or asset.    \nF.  Procurement \n48.  The  DOH\u2019s  overall  procurement  capacity  is  limited.  It  has  limited  experience  with \nundertaking procurement in accordance with ADB\u2019s procurement policies and regulations, as well \nas limited knowledge in the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines. Compounding these constraints, \nabout 24% of DOH staff positions remain unfilled, so the current staff resources are stretched. To \nmitigate these constraints, ADB will assist DOH with vaccine procurement by advising on the \nvolatile market and associated procurement-related risks, reviewing contracts under bilateral \nagreements, supporting with price validation, and assisting in the preparations for negotiations \nwith vaccine manufacturers.  \n \nG.  Summary of Risk Assessment and Risk Management Plan \n \n49.  Significant risks and mitigating measures are summarized in Table 7 and described in \ndetail in the risk assessment and risk management plan.53 Considering that risks and the required \n52F\nmitigation measures will evolve as vaccines are rolled out, ADB will work with DOH, IATF, other \ndevelopment partners, and civil society organizations in monitoring the roll out of the vaccines \nand mitigation measures.  \n \nTable 7: Summary of Risks and Mitigating Measures \nRisks  Mitigation Measures \nCountry-Specific  Government will continue to engage with vaccine suppliers and \nLimited capacity of vaccine suppliers to meet  endeavor  to  meet  documentation requirements  and payment \nglobal  demand,  including  demand  from  the  terms (e.g., advance payment) in a timely manner. \nPhilippines, leads to delays in delivery. \nSector-Specific  DOH will continue to strengthen the country\u2019s health system with \nCOVID-19 vaccination target of up to 70 million  support of development partners.

Group A (estimated at 24.7 million or \n23% of the total population), the first target group, prioritizes frontline health workers, indigent senior citizens, \nremaining senior citizens and indigent populations, and uniformed personnel. Group B, the second target group (up \nto 44% of the total population), covers teachers and social workers; other government workers (national and local); \nother essential workers outside health, education, and social sectors; socio-demographic groups at significant risk \nother than senior citizens and indigent populations (persons with disability, persons deprived of liberty, persons living \nin high-density areas); overseas Filipino workers; and the remaining Filipino workforce (as may be determined by \ngovernment agencies).
