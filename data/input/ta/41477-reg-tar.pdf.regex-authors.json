The anticorruption policy1 of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has three objectives: \n(i) to support competitive markets and efficient, effective, accountable, and transparent public \nadministration as part of ADB\u2019s broader work in good governance and capacity building; (ii) to \nsupport promising anticorruption efforts and improve the quality of dialogue on governance and \ncorruption with developing member countries (DMCs); and (iii) to ensure that ADB projects and \nstaff members adhere to the highest ethical standards. This technical assistance (TA) project \nfocuses on the third objective.  \n2.  Introducing  and  improving  frameworks  for  procurement,  implementation,  and  audit \npractices for ADB projects, and enhancing the capacity of DMC officials to detect, deter, and \naddress potential fraud and corruption in ADB-financed projects, will make the DMCs better \nequipped to achieve the objectives of ADB projects. Because fraud and corruption usually \nentails concealment, a different set of skills is needed to prevent and detect these crimes. DMC \nofficials and other stakeholders will be trained to recognize and detect these elements and to \nunderstand the psychology of motivation and rationalization behind fraud and corruption, as well \nas  to  detect  weaknesses  in  the  internal  controls  of  their  organizations.  The  design  and \nmonitoring framework of the TA project is in Appendix 1.  \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  ADB  affirms  that  corrupt  and  illicit  behavior  seriously  threatens  development.  The \nanticorruption policy is part of ADB\u2019s broader effort to advance transparency, predictability, \naccountability, and participation under its governance policy2 and its second governance and \nanticorruption action plan. The Integrity Division, Office of the Auditor General (OAGI), is the \nfocal point of contact for allegations of fraud and corruption in ADB-financed projects and \namong staff involved in these projects, and the sole office designated by the anticorruption \npolicy to investigate such allegations. \n4.  OAGI coordinates with ADB\u2019s regional departments and the Central Operations Services \nOffice to ensure the timely detection and prevention of fraud and corruption in ADB operations. \nOAGI  has  audited  procurement  in  selected  ADB  projects  since  2003.  It  has  promoted \ncompliance with the anticorruption policy by providing resource speakers for ADB-sponsored \nseminars  and  conducting  workshops  and  seminars  for  borrowers  and  executing  agencies. \nHowever, these efforts must be expanded to expose DMC officials and other stakeholders to \nindicators of fraud and corruption, outline measures to address such concerns, and emphasize \nborrowers\u2019  obligations  to  perform  adequate  due  diligence  in  implementing  ADB-financed \nprojects. \n5.  Through periodic seminars OAGI will be able to increase the awareness of fraud and \ncorruption  among  borrowers,  executing  agencies,  supreme  audit  institutions,  and  other \nstakeholders  responsible  for  or  involved  in  project  administration,  procurement,  audit,  and \nanticorruption efforts in DMCs. Participants will be trained in, among other things, the best \npractices in proactive operational work, including organizing and managing operations in a \nmanner that counters fraud and corruption. OAGI will assist and train operational staff and \n                                                 \n1  ADB. 1998. Anticorruption Policy.

THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n6.  The  objective  of  the  TA  is  to  reduce  the  risk  of  fraud  and  corruption  in  selected \nADB-financed  projects  by  increasing  the  understanding  of  and  compliance  with  ADB\u2019s \nanticorruption policy and raising the awareness of potential irregularities throughout the project \norganizations  implementing  these  projects,  including  representatives  of  executing  and \nimplementing agencies, project management and implementation units, project management \nconsultants,  members  of  steering  and  evaluation  committees,  beneficiaries,  and  other \nstakeholders, and thus help strengthen project administration. The TA beneficiaries will better \nunderstand ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and related procedures and be able to identify and \naddress potential fraud and corruption in ADB-financed activities.  \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n7.  In consultation with the regional departments OAGI will select six to nine new, large, or \nspecifically vulnerable projects in DMCs in Central and West Asia, South Asia, and Southeast \nAsia,  and  conduct  anticorruption  training  for  officials,  consultants,  beneficiaries  and  other \nstakeholders involved in these projects. Other regions may be considered, subject to budget \navailability and project priority or sensitivity. \n8.  Local  seminars  consisting  of  up  to  three  1-day  training  sessions,  each  one  with  a \nmaximum of 30 participants, will be held for selected projects. OAGI will conduct the seminars in \ncoordination with local anticorruption commissions or supreme audit institutions in the second \nhalf of 2008 and in 2009. Responsible regional department project officers, in conjunction with \ngovernments,  will  nominate  participants.  The  list  of  nominees  will  be  submitted  to  the \ngovernments for endorsement. Additional nominations from the governments may be accepted, \nsubject to confirmation by ADB. ADB\u2019s resident missions and counterpart agencies in DMCs \nmay  recommend  government  or  ministry  officials.  All  participants  must  have  a  working \nknowledge of English. \n9.  The seminars will deal with ADB\u2019s anticorruption policy and ways to prevent and detect \nfraud and corruption in ADB-financed projects, such as procurement audit methods, and will \nallow participants to share experiences and discuss procurement and governance issues. The \nseminars may also form part of project implementation and administration seminars of the \nCentral Operations Services Office if appropriate and targeting the same projects selected in \ncoordination with the regional departments. \n10.  The seminars will consist of lectures and presentations by OAGI\u2019s integrity specialists, \nlocal anticorruption authorities and supreme audit institutions, and other appropriate resource \nspeakers, and will cover topics such as field experiences and lessons learned, including case \nstudies on specific anticorruption issues. ", "  3\nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The cost estimates are based on a total of 15 days of training covering projects in six to \nnine DMCs in three regions, and ideally conducted in three batches of consecutive seminars to \nmaximize  travel  costs.  The  total  cost  of  the  TA  is  estimated  at  $450,000  equivalent \n(Appendix 2). The TA will be financed with a grant from ADB\u2019s TA funding program. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements  \n12.  ADB, through OAGI, will be responsible for implementing the TA, including planning the \nseminar contents and preparing the presentation and training materials. OAGI will recruit one \nnational  individual  consultant  for  a  total  of  12  person-months  to  make  the  administrative \narrangements for the seminars. The consultant will be hired by ADB according to its Guidelines \non the Use of Consultants (2007, as amended from time to time). The consultant must be \nknowledgeable  about  ADB\u2019s  setup,  policies,  procedures,  and  operations.  Outline  terms  of \nreference for the national consulting services are in Appendix 3. \n13.  The TA will begin in April 2008. The first batch of seminars will be held in the second half \nof 2008 and is intended to cover up to three projects in DMCs in Southeast Asia, subject to the \npriority of projects selected in coordination with the regional departments. The next batch of \nseminars will be held in 2009 and is planned to cover up to three projects in Central and West \nAsia during the first half of 2009, and in South Asia during the second half of 2009. The \nestimated completion date is December 2009. All materials and services will be purchased \naccording  to  ADB's  Procurement  Guidelines  (2007,  as  amended  from  time  to  time). \nNo-objection or concurrence letters will be obtained from participating DMCs. No TA activities \nwill be carried out in a DMC until OAGI has received the DMC\u2019s no-objection or concurrence \nletter.  \n14.  The participants\u2019 knowledge will be tested through questionnaires to be administered \nduring the seminar. Their evaluation of the usefulness of the seminar and the logistic and \nadministrative  arrangements,  at  the  end  of  each  seminar,  will  help  OAGI  to  continuously \nimprove the seminars. Selected projects that also qualify for project procurement-related audits \nwill be considered in OAGI\u2019s annual planning cycle for projects that should undergo such audits.  \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT\u2019S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved the \nprovision of technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $450,000 on a grant basis for \nAnticorruption Seminars, 2008\u20132009, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n ", " 4  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n  \nDesign  Performance Indicators/  Data Sources/ Reporting  Assumptions \nSummary  Targets  Mechanisms  and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nRisk of fraud and corruption  \u2022  Fewer cases of fraud and  \u2022  OAGI\u2019s anticorruption  \u2022  Selected projects will be \nis reduced in projects  corruption in targeted  database  considered for PPRA or \nimplemented by trained  projects  performance audit  \n\u2022  Project procurement-\nstaff, and ADB and DMC \n\u2022  Less sanctions imposed  related audit reports  Risks \ncounterpart funds are put to \nbetter use  on bidders and  \u2022  Audit reports  \u2022  Participants make \ncontractors participating \n\u2022  Project performance  adverse use of the \nin selected projects \nreports  training to avoid detection \n\u2022  Less red flags and more    in corrupt or fraudulent \nsupport for training  practices \nobjectives in PPRA    \nfindings \nOutcome  Assumptions \n   \nProject staff have a better  \u2022  Fewer complaints of  \u2022  OAGI\u2019s anticorruption  \u2022  A considerable number  \nunderstanding of ADB\u2019s  alleged fraud and  database  of staff involved in \nanticorruption policy and  corruption as a result of  administering the project \n \nincreased awareness of the  early detection of  will attend the seminar \npotential for fraud and  potential irregularities, or \n\u2022  Participants share the \ncorruption \n\u2022  Increased reporting to or  knowledge obtained with \n  consultation with OAGI  nonparticipating and new \nregarding potential  project staff \nincidences of fraud and \nRisks \ncorruption, as a result of \nincreased awareness  \u2022  Know-how of leaving staff  \nis not transferred to other \n \nproject staff  \n  \n \nOutput  Assumptions \n   \nSeminar participants  \u2022  Improved understanding  \u2022  Seminar questionnaires  \u2022  No-objection letter is \nunderstand ADB\u2019s  of ADB\u2019s anticorruption  issued by each country  \n\u2022  Group exercises and \nanticorruption policy and  policy and red flags \ncase studies  \u2022  The local anticorruption \nknow indicators of potential \n\u2022  Familiarity with reporting  commission or supreme \nfraud and corruption \nmechanisms  audit institution \nparticipates in the training \n\u2022  The majority of the staff \nof the selected project \nare available for and \nattend the training \n \n ", "Appendix 1  5\nActivities and Milestones  Inputs \n\u2022  Select new, large, or specifically vulnerable projects in  \u2022  ADB financing of $450,000, from ADB\u2019s TA funding \nconsultation with regional departments  program.
