INTRODUCTION \n1.  This knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) cluster will support developing \nmember countries (DMCs) of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in effectively identifying high-\nlevel  technology  (HLT)  solutions  for  development  projects.  The  TA  cluster  will  enable \ncollaborations with technology providers from the public and private sectors, academia, and \nresearch institutes, while building capacity in DMCs to develop sustainable projects and programs \nwith HLT applications.1 \n \n2.  In line with the objective, eligibility criteria, and scope of the High-Level Technology Fund, \nthe TA cluster will support DMCs\u2019 decisions to introduce HLT into projects and provide guidance \non how to proceed to project preparation and due diligence.2 Under the TA cluster, technology \nproviders will be invited to offer proposals on HLT prefeasibility studies and innovative solutions \nto address specific development challenges.3 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n3.  Asia and the Pacific has made great progress in economic development and poverty \nreduction. As a result, the region\u2019s development needs have become more diverse, and new \ndevelopment challenges have emerged as several DMCs have graduated to middle-income \nstatus. Many DMCs expect infrastructure with high efficiency, functionality, and faster service \ndelivery. Less-developed countries are expanding infrastructure with conventional technology, \nwhile they aim to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in line with climate change goals. Advanced \ntechnologies and innovative solutions could provide these DMCs with a range of social, economic, \nand environmental benefits while expanding infrastructure. \n \n4.  HLT includes new and advanced technologies or innovative solutions that can reduce the \nlife cycle cost of infrastructure, lower operation and maintenance cost, and increase durability.4 \nModern  and  advanced  equipment  can  improve  efficiency  and  productivity,  thereby  saving \nresources. The adoption of innovative construction methods and technologies can minimize \nnegative environmental and social impacts. Innovative approaches and a combination of different \ntechnologies can also improve the delivery of social services. \n \n5.  However, many DMCs find it challenging to employ HLT in meeting their infrastructure \ndevelopment needs. HLT often originates in developed countries, and HLT companies are often \nnot familiar with the policies and decision makers of emerging market DMCs. Although these \ncompanies have better solutions for these DMCs\u2019 development needs, they may not enter these \nmarkets.  In  addition,  the  skills  and  experience  required  to  develop  detailed  technology \nspecifications, evaluate HLT solutions, and identify relevant technology providers are often limited \nin DMCs. But there are several middle-income countries that are becoming technology innovators \nand can share important lessons learnt with other DMCs from developing and implementing \nsolutions. They can provide insights on needs and requirements for HLT companies to enter DMC \nmarkets. \n \n6.  The TA cluster will create a platform for novel engagement with technology providers to \nenable HLT adoptions in collaboration with DMC agencies. The TA cluster will build the capacity \n                                                \n1  The TA first appeared in the business opportunities section of ADB\u2019s website on 23 November 2018. \n2  ADB. 2017. Establishment of the High-Level Technology Fund. Manila. \n3  Technology  providers  include  manufacturers,  private  investors,  general  contractors,  research  institutions, \nconsultants, and civil society organizations. \n4  Examples of projects using advanced technologies approved under the HLT Fund are in List of Projects and Activities \nSupported by the High-Level Technology Fund (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "2 \nof DMC counterparts to (i) design projects with HLT applications; (ii) understand the HLT market \nin specific sectors; (iii) assess HLT ecosystem readiness; and (iv) leverage ADB\u2019s sector-, \nthematic-, and DMC-specific knowledge. \n \n7.  Technology  providers  know  their  technologies  and  their  research  and  development \npipeline best. By engaging with them through this TA, ADB can leverage their expertise to identify \nHLT solutions to help solve specific challenges in DMCs. By using the HLT Fund implementation \narrangements under this TA, the early engagement with technology providers will enable them to \nparticipate in ADB\u2019s competitive procurement processes during project development. \n \nIII.  JUSTIFICATION FOR CLUSTER MODALITY \n8.  The HLT Fund was designed such that each sector group may use a TA cluster and seek \nproposals from firms applying HLT in DMCs.5 This modality allows for building a platform for HLT \napplications across sectors, as well as to roll out new approaches to engage with technology \nproviders through proposals, before an ADB project is being prepared, while also building capacity \nin DMCs. The TA cluster will create structures and systems to better link ADB knowledge and \noperations with practitioners in DMCs and with HLT providers. In doing so, the cluster approach \nwill  enable  systematically  advancing  knowledge  and  technology  solutions  to  address \ndevelopment problems. Through a cluster modality, the TA creates a platform for (i) learning from \neach subproject, (ii) expanding the financing of the TA later depending on its success, and (iii) \ndeveloping comprehensive and holistic solutions by engaging with multiple partners. These can \n \nbe applied beyond this TA after completion.\n \nIV.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CLUSTER \nA.  Impact, Outcome, and Outputs \n9.  The TA cluster is aligned with the following impact: use of advanced and innovative \ntechnologies across ADB operations promoted and capacity building support to DMCs provided.6 \nThe TA cluster will have the following outcome: DMCs\u2019 ability to evaluate HLT solutions for \ncountry-specific development challenges enabled.7 \n \n10.  Output 1 (subproject 1): ADB innovation knowledge sharing enabled. Under this \noutput, innovation assessments building on the Innovative Asia: Advancing the Knowledge-Based \nEconomy report series8 will be conducted in selected DMCs. These assessments will focus on \nselected Strategy 2030 operational priority areas, determined based on their relevance to the \nsubprojects under outputs 2 and 3. The assessments will aim to (i) understand and define \ndevelopment challenges that can be addressed with HLT solutions and (ii) explore and scan what \nkind of HLT innovations are available to address those challenges. The assessments will also \nanalyze the enabling environment for HLT applications to understand how to overcome potential \ninnovation  barriers  through  policy  dialogue,  capacity  development,  and  investment.  The \nassessments will be conducted through consultation workshops, desktop research, and key \ninformant  interviews.  Relevant  sector  and  thematic  groups  will  be  fully  onboard.  Close \ncollaboration with the activities under the ADB Ventures Facility, which is being implemented by \n                                                \n5  ADB. 2017.

The  case  studies  will  be \ndisseminated through ADB communication channels. They will contribute to ADB\u2019s innovation \ndissemination platform, which aims to link the websites of the ADB Ventures Facility, the HLT \nFund, Development Asia, and the Innovations Speakers\u2019 series. This output will also provide \ntechnical and facilitation support for outputs 2 and 3. \n \n11.  Output 2 (proposal-based subprojects 2\u20134): Application of high-level technology \nsolutions in the energy sector assessed. This output will test a new engagement modality with \ntechnology providers to advance HLT innovations in DMCs, beginning with the energy sector.10 \nThe energy sector group, in close collaboration with DMC experts, will define energy-specific \ndevelopment challenges. Such challenges could be related to improving energy efficiency of \ncooling or heating systems, providing clean water in an off-grid environment, or any other energy \nrelated challenges that have been identified as relevant. Proposals will be sought from technology \nproviders to respond to the development challenge with an HLT solution. Based on the selection \ncriteria, which will be defined through the TA implementation arrangements, three proposal-based \nsubprojects will be selected and implemented. Each technology provider will receive up to \n$500,000 to engage with selected DMCs in order to assess if and how their proposed HLT solution \ncould be applied in DMCs. The assessment may include a proof of concept for the HLT application, \nor a rapid prefeasibility study. The results will be shared with DMC counterparts in workshops and \nas case studies through ADB communication channels. The workshops will also be used to build \nDMCs\u2019 capacity to develop specifications for energy-specific development challenges, evaluate \nHLT proposals, and understand how to scale up HLT innovations. \n \n12.  Output 3 (proposal-based subprojects 5\u201310): Application of high-level technology \nsolutions in other sectors assessed. The sector and thematic groups, in close collaboration \nwith DMC experts, will identify development challenges related to ADB\u2019s sectors and themes or \nto Strategy 2030 operational priorities that could benefit from HLT solutions. Proposals will be \nsought from technology providers to respond to the development challenge with an HLT solution. \nBased  on  specific  selection  criteria,  which  will  be  defined  through  the  TA  implementation \narrangements, six proposal-based subprojects will be selected and implemented. The same \nprocedures as under output 2 will be followed. \n \nB.  Cost and Financing \n13.  The TA cluster is estimated to cost $4,900,000, of which (i) $400,000 will be financed on \na  grant  basis  by  ADB\u2019s  Technical  Assistance  Special  Fund  (TASF-other  sources)  and  (ii) \n$4,500,000 will be financed on a grant basis by the HLT Fund and administered by ADB.11 The \nTechnical Assistance Special Fund resources will be used for output 1. The HLT Fund will finance \noutputs 2 and 3 with a maximum of $500,000 for each proposed subproject. Detailed cost \nestimates and financing arrangements will be presented in each TA subproject proposal. The \nselected  technology  providers  may  use  their  own  sources  of funding to  supplement  costs \nexceeding their approved subproject budgets. \n \n                                                \n9  ADB. 2018.

Funding approval of $1,500,000 by the HLT Fund for output 2 is \nexpected within 2018, with the remainder expected to be approved in 2019 and 2020. \n ", "4 \nC.  Implementation Arrangements \n14.  ADB will administer the TA cluster. The Knowledge Sharing and Services Center (SDCC-\nKS) under the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department (SDCC) will lead the \noverall implementation, including the subproject under output 1. Subprojects under outputs 2 and \n3 will be administered by SDCC-KS and implemented by the respective sector and thematic \ngroups  and  ADB\u2019s  regional  departments.  Ownership  of  the  subprojects  by  the  regional \ndepartments,  resident missions,  and  DMCs  is  essential.  Experts from respective  sector  or \nthematic groups will form a core group including from SDCC-KS, regional departments, the \nPrivate  Sector  Operations  Department,  and  resident  missions  to  define  the  development \nchallenge\u2014together with the respective DMCs\u2014that will be addressed with HLT solutions.12 This \nchallenge will then be developed into a call for proposals that seeks HLT solutions that can meet \nthis challenge. The call for proposals will be advertised on www.adb.org and social media such \nas LinkedIn. ADB\u2019s procurement principles of economy, efficiency, fairness, transparency, quality, \nand value for money will be applied. SDCC-KS experts and consultants recruited under subproject \n1 will support this process. The selected proposals will form the subprojects for the TA. \n \n15.  Participating DMCs will be asked to provide their no-objection to this TA. In addition, before \nsubproject approval, confirmation will be received from the DMC concerned that the HLT solution \nmay be employed within the market and, if not so established, may be tested for suitability for \nmarket entry or service provision. The participating DMCs will be confirmed for each subproject, \ndepending on the call for proposals and the extended expressions of interest (EOIs) received. \n \n16.  Mitigating measures will be undertaken to allow technology providers contracted through \nthis TA to remain eligible for downstream business opportunities. Pursuant to the provisions of \nthe implementation guidelines for the HLT Fund, the governments accessing ADB funding for \ndownstream projects will be encouraged to pursue competitive selection of HLT providers using \nfunctional specifications that allow wider market participation. In addition, firms engaged through \nthis  TA  will  not  be  directly  involved  in  preparing  bid  documents  and  evaluating  bids  for \ndownstream contract packages. Moreover, the outputs of the subprojects (e.g., prefeasibility \nstudies) will be disclosed to the public, which will ensure that the providers engaged under this \nTA will not have an unfair competitive advantage. With these measures in place, HLT providers \nwill be advised that participation in this TA will not preclude them from eligibility to bid for \nsubsequent  HLT  contracts  under  ADB-financed  projects.  In  addition,  subproject-specific \nparameters and requirements will be developed regarding intellectual property rights, which may \nresult from individual subprojects. Assessments and reports produced under the TA will be made \npublicly available in line with ADB\u2019s Public Communication Policy 2011. \n \nTable 1: Implementation Arrangements for the Technical Assistance Cluster \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation  December 2018\u2013September 2022 \nperiod for the TA cluster \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank\u2014Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment (Knowledge Sharing and Services Center) \nImplementing agency  Asian Development Bank\u2014Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment (Knowledge Sharing and Services Center) will administer the \nTA cluster and oversee overall TA implementation, including subproject 1. \nSubproject 1 will be led by ADB\u2019s Sustainable Development and Climate \nChange Department in collaboration with sector or thematic groups and \n                                                \n12 Roles and Responsibilities (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "5 \nAspects  Arrangements \nPrivate Sector Operations Department.

Consulting  services.  Individual  consultants  will  be  recruited  to  support  the \nimplementation of subproject 1. International consultant inputs (technical writer and web content \nproducer, visual communication expert and graphic designer, and technology innovation expert) \nand national consultant inputs (administrator and finance expert, and auditor) are required to \nsupport  the  identification  of  the  development  challenges  and  the  assessment  of  ongoing \ninnovations in selected DMCs. This will inform the subproject preparation and the engagement \n ", "6 \nwith DMCs, while creating knowledge related to the innovation context in selected DMCs. Output-\nbased and/or lump-sum contracts will be considered, but time-based contracts will be used as \nappropriate. The consultants will be engaged in accordance with the ADB Procurement Policy \n(2017, as amended from time to time) and the associated project administration instructions \nand/or staff instructions. The estimated cost and requisite fields of expertise are indicative; \nestimates will be finalized before subproject approval in consultation with the sector and thematic \ngroups. \n \n19.  Pilot testing of project approach. ADB will assess all proposals under outputs 2 and 3 \nto determine if there will be any involuntary resettlement or impact on the environment and \nindigenous peoples. Proposals with minimal or no such impacts will be eligible to receive ADB \nfinancing. Detailed implementation arrangements for pilot testing will be finalized before the \napproval of each TA subproject in consultation with the government during follow-up missions. \n \n20.  ADB\u2019s procurement. The TA cluster will follow the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as \namended from time to time). Lessons learned and best practices in the procurement of HLT will \nbe reviewed and adapted as appropriate, for example, from the Organisation for Economic Co-\noperation  and  Development\u2019s  framework  of  public  procurement  for  innovation.13 ADB  will \ncustomize procurement documentation to fit the purpose. This would include specific procurement \narrangements, with corresponding risk-mitigation measures, to (i) not exclude the participating \nHLT providers from supplying the solutions in response to downstream tenders in ADB-financed \nprojects and (ii) provide the ability to award pre-commercialization gap-mitigation contracts to \nmore than one qualified proponent. The submitted extended EOIs will be evaluated by a team of \nexperts  from  SDCC;  the  regional  department  sector  or  thematic  experts;  SDCC-KS;  the \nProcurement, Portfolio and Financial Management Department; and the HLT Fund manager. \nEach subproject will require the endorsement of the head of the respective regional department \nand  the  respective  country  director.  Detailed  procurement  arrangements,  emphasizing  fair \ncompetition and transparency and addressing any intellectual property rights issues, will be \nfinalized before approval of each TA subproject. \n \n21.  Social media and websites. The TA cluster will use ADB-supported website and social \nmedia channels that are maintained by SDCC-KS and follow the ADB Guidelines on Social Media \nand the Branding Tool Kit.14 \n \nV.
