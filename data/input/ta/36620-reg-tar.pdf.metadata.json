The Greater Mekong  Subregion (GMS) Economic Cooperation Program, initiated in \n1992 with assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), promotes sustainable economic \ngrowth and helps reduce poverty in the subregion by strengthening the economic linkages \nbetween the six participating countries.1 In the GMS countries, agriculture sector plays a vital \nrole in reducing rural poverty, and is a priority sector under the GMS Program. In April 2002, \nADB  provided  small-scale  technical  assistance  (TA)2  to  facilitate consultations  and  identify \nopportunities for increased cooperation in the agriculture sector among GMS members. Based \non  these  consultations,  in  July  2002,  the  GMS  countries  established  a  working  group  on \nagriculture (WGA) as a forum for identifying and realizing opportunities to increase cooperation \namong GMS countries in the agriculture sector. In June 2003, ADB provided a regional TA3 for \nproviding technical, financial, and administrative support for the operationalization of the WGA. \nThis TA was implemented successfully, and has brought about greater awareness and closer \ncooperation in several areas in GMS agriculture. \n \n2.  During the second GMS Leaders\u2019 Summit held in Kunming, People\u2019s Republic of China \n(PRC) on 4\u20135 July 2005, the GMS heads of governments affirmed that agricultural development \nis essential for poverty reduction and pledged to (i) accelerate cooperation in the agriculture \nsector, and (ii) focus on collaborative efforts on the cross-border dimensions of agriculture. \nCiting ADB\u2019s unique role as lead coordinator, facilitator, and catalyst of the GMS Program, the \nGMS leaders urged ADB to play an even larger role in bringing GMS to the center stage of \neconomic integration in Asia by mobilizing higher levels of resource and knowledge transfers. \nThe GMS leaders also called on ADB to help organize an agriculture ministers\u2019 meeting to \ngalvanize  support  for  the  sector  within  a  common  framework  of  partnership  among  GMS \ncountries and other stakeholders. \n \n3.  In response to the Kunming Declaration, ADB assisted in preparing a draft strategic \nframework and a core agriculture sector program (CASP) for regional cooperation in agriculture. \nThis was discussed and endorsed in principle by all six countries at the third meeting of the \nGMS WGA, held in Hue, Viet Nam on 15\u201316 February 2006. The CASP (2006\u20132010) provides \na common vision for policy and program development in the region. It comprises (i) cross-border \nagricultural trade program, (ii) partnership program for a GMS agriculture knowledge network, \n(iii) cooperative program for capacity building in agriculture, and (iv) emergency preparedness \nand  response  program  for  agricultural  crises.  The  proposed  TA  will  support  the \noperationalization of the CASP. The TA design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1.   \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n4.  Reducing poverty is the overriding priority of all GMS countries, where more than 30% of \nthe  population  (about  310  million)  lives  below  the  poverty  line.  Despite  strong  economic \nperformance and improving living conditions over the last decade, poverty remains widespread. \nAgriculture is the major source of employment in GMS countries and a significant contributor to \nexport earnings, much of which is intra-GMS trade in agriculture and agro-based products. \nAgriculture\u2019s contribution to gross national product ranges from about 60% in Myanmar, 53% in \nLao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, and 37% in Cambodia to 24% in Viet Nam, 21% in Yunnan, \n                                                 \n1  Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR), Myanmar, Thailand, Viet Nam, and Yunnan Province \nand Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the People\u2019s Republic of China. \n2  ADB. 2002.

", "2 \n20% in Guangxi, and 9% in Thailand. Most of the poverty occurs in rural areas where the poor \ncontinue to depend on semi-subsistence agriculture for their livelihood. \n \n5.  Current constraints to agriculture-led growth are quite different from those during the \ngreen revolution. Most readily available arable lands have already been cultivated and any \nincrease in productivity is possible mostly through improved technology and increased access to \nresources. The forces of trade liberalization and globalization often shift the power structures \n(and values) of agricultural value chains away from producers, which prevents many producers \nin developing countries from reaping the benefits of increased agricultural productivity. Thus, \nthere is a need for upgrading these value chains within GMS countries by creating conditions \nconducive  for  investments  and  promoting  product  and  process  innovations.  Further,  the \nincreased consumer awareness on health and safety concerns and the requirements for widely \nrecognized standards by global markets requires implementation of sanitary and phytosanitary \nmeasures in agricultural trade. Therefore, producers must actively respond to the changing \nstructure of market demand in addition to using a new generation of technologies.  \n \n6.  In GMS countries, the current policy environments are not fully conducive to producer \ncompetitiveness, and the agricultural industries are still at an early stage of development. There \nis a need for governments to provide trade support services to facilitate access to intra- and \ninterregional markets, reduce transaction costs and provide the requisite trade knowledge, so \nthat the region itself could become competitive with sufficient economies of scale. Genuine \npartnership between GMS countries, bilateral donors, and international and regional agricultural \nresearch institutions; and increased technical and financial resources must also be committed \nover  extended  periods  to  support  the  development  of  regional  and  national  capacities  for \nimproving competitiveness, establishing the needed policy framework and common standards, \nremoving trade barriers, and facilitating national and international marketing of export quality \nproducts.  \n \n7.  With increasing urban-rural disparity, there is a need to reduce the knowledge divide to \nenable rural farmers to acquire the knowledge needed to adjust and meet modern challenges in \nagriculture. This could be achieved by establishing an agriculture information network service \n(AINS) and agri-knowledge platforms. Much information on agriculture is available on various \ninformation networks and knowledge banks4 established by specialized agencies. However, the \nlack  of  effective  mechanisms  to  share  this  information  among  the  relevant  people  and \norganizations in the subregion constrains opportunities to capitalize on it, and lack of access to \ntimely information limits the capacity to effectively and efficiently respond to cross-border threats \nand opportunities in the subregion. The need to establish a subregional network covering all \naspects of agriculture was endorsed by all six countries at an agriculture information network \nworkshop5 in the PRC in December 2004. It was also agreed that PRC would serve as the lead \nfor  establishing  and  managing  the  network.  Details  of  the  proposed  establishment  and \noperationalization of AINS are in Appendix 2. While AINS would help in sharing the information \non agriculture knowledge, there a need to help rural farmers acquire and apply knowledge to \nlocal conditions for increasing the productivity of sustainable agriculture. One way of addressing \nthis problem is to establish rural agri-knowledge platforms that could serve as one-stop service \ncenters to help farmers acquire and apply knowledge. These platforms could be supported by \ntechnical hubs maintained by national and regional centers of excellence. \n                                                 \n4  Rice Knowledge Bank (RKB) developed by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI); Agriculture Knowledge \nPlatform for Mekong Countries (AGRIMEK) and Markets and Agriculture Linkages for Cities in Asia (MALICA) \ndeveloped  by  the  Centre  de  coop\u00e9ration  internationale  en  recherche  agronomique  pour  le  d\u00e9veloppement \n(CIRAD). \n5  GMS agricultural information network workshop organized by the PRC Ministry of Agriculture and held in Beijing, \nPRC on 7\u20139 December 2004.  ", "3 \n \n8.  Following the WGA-1 meeting,6 ADB financed several initiatives on agriculture from  \n2003 to 2004,7 and provided an umbrella TA (footnote 3) to partly finance the cost of agriculture \nworkshops and seminars organized by GMS countries and partner organizations, such as the \nFood and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and selected Consultative Group on International \nAgriculture  Research  (CGIAR)  centers.  These  action-oriented  initiatives,  which  included \nfinancing  the  WGA-28  and  WGA-3  meetings,  have  contributed  to  closer  partnership  and \ncollaboration among GMS countries. They have also resulted in minimizing duplication of efforts \nand increasing investments in capacity building in the agriculture sector in GMS countries. With \nthe preparation of the strategic framework and the CASP, the task of coordinating countrywide \nand intraregional programs and projects becomes more complex. Mechanisms for coordination, \noperational protocols and procedures, and cooperation agreements among GMS countries need \nto be established and national coordination support services will have to be strengthened for \neffective country consultation on priority issues.  \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n9.  The intended impact of the TA is enhanced growth performance of the agriculture sector \nin the in the GMS region through increased investments and enhanced cross-border trade \ntransactions among GMS countries, and with various regions of the globe. The outcome of the \nTA will be the acceleration and expansion of subregional cooperation in the with agriculture \nsector by promoting partnerships in priority areas identified by the WGA. The TA will help GMS \ncountries  to  work  together  to  reap  the  benefits  of  increased  connectivity,  enhanced \ncompetitiveness, and a greater sense of community.  \n \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n \n10.  The TA will focus on developing and implementing programs and projects under the \nCASP.  It  will  adopt  a  multi-stakeholder,  participatory  diagnosis  and  design  approach. \nPartnerships  will  be  established  between  GMS  countries,  FAO,  International  Fund  for \nAgricultural  Development  (IFAD),  and  centers  of  excellence  such  as  CGIAR  centers\u2014to \nfacilitate the sharing of best practices, research results, and lessons learned. The TA will (i) \nprovide opportunities for extensive training and consultations with GMS countries, development \npartners and other stakeholders; and (ii) coordinate with other GMS working groups9 to ensure \nthat there is synergy among all sectors covered by GMS programs. In addition to specific \nactivities identified under CASP, the TA will identify other activities for implementation for the \nnext 5\u201310 years, which will be discussed and endorsed by the WGA. Wherever possible, the TA \nwill also provide seed money for starting these activities and seek financial or technical support \nfrom other development partners.  \n \n                                                 \n6   Held at ADB headquarters in Manila, Philippines on 20\u201321 January 2003. \n7  ADB. 2003.

The  TA  will  have  the  following  components:  (i)  enhancement  of  coordination  and \ncommunication  among  GMS  countries,  (ii)  facilitation  of  cross-border  agriculture  trade  and \ninvestment, and (iii) establishment of AINS and agri-knowledge platforms. For each of the \ncomponents, the TA will provide opportunities\u2014through WGA meetings and consultations\u2014to \nstrengthen  active  partnerships  with  private  sector  and  other  development  partners  for \nprocessing  and  implementation  of  other  collaborative  projects,  and  for  implementing  joint \nresearch activities.  \n \n(i)  Enhancement of coordination and communication among GMS countries. \nThis  will  involve  strengthening  of  institutional  capacities  by  developing \nappropriate  procedures  and  protocols  among  GMS  countries  for  the \nimplementation of WGA\u2019s programs and projects, particularly the CASP. It will \nsupport two annual meetings of WGA (WGA-4 in 2006 and WGA-5 in 2007) and \none GMS agriculture ministers\u2019 meeting (in late 2006), and special studies10 to be \nidentified during implementation. Other activities include (a) preparation of an \noperational manual, (b) establishment of communities of practice among GMS \ncountries and development partners, and (c) conduct of training programs on \nspecific subjects to be identified by WGA.  \n \n(ii)  Facilitation  of  cross-border  agriculture  trade  and  investment.  This  will \ninvolve (a) assessment of national and regional competitiveness on agricultural \ntrade, (b) identification of priority agricultural trade products, (c) formulation and \nimplementation  of  trade  facilitation  projects  among  GMS  countries  in \ncollaboration with development partners, and (d) holding training programs and \nworkshops.  The  initiatives  will  include  studies  on  international  sanitary  and \nphytosanitary standards.  \n \n(iii)  Establishment  of  AINS  and  agri-knowledge  platforms.  This  will  involve \n(a) developing a web-enabled database and interface, (b) conducting training \nprograms and consultation workshops for target users of AINS, (c) supporting  \nimproved data collection and  compilation,  (d)  establishing  protocols  for  data \nexchange  standards  and  interoperability  among  GMS  countries  for  improved \ninformation flows, and (e) facilitating the establishment of rural agri-knowledge \nplatforms in each GMS country with regional and national technical hubs. Further \ndetails are in Appendix 2. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n12.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $1,000,000 equivalent. ADB will finance the \nequivalent  of  $400,000  on  a  grant  basis  from  ADB\u2019s  TA  funding  program.  The  remaining \nequivalent of $600,000 will be financed by the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, \nand administered by ADB. Detailed cost estimates and financing plan are in Appendix 3. \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n13.  The Agriculture, Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Southeast Asia \nDepartment (SEAE) in ADB will be the Executing Agency for the TA, and it will establish a \nsecretariat comprising core professional staff and secretarial service for implementing the TA \nactivities.  The  secretariat  will  be  responsible  for  preparing  the  summary  reports  and \nproceedings of the WGA and agriculture ministers meetings. GMS agriculture coordinators will, \nin  consultation  with  relevant  GMS  national  coordinators,  continue  to  be  responsible  for \n                                                 \n10  This will include assessment of biofuel as a source of rural energy.   ", "5 \n(i) coordinating activities in the agriculture sector in GMS countries; and (ii) networking between \nWGA and development partners, and the private sector. The TA will be implemented over \n2 years from July 2006 to June 2008 in collaboration with other GMS working groups. The \nprogress and outputs of the TA will be shared with WGA members and, where appropriate, \ndiscussed at the annual meetings of the WGA.  \n \n14.  Development of the AINS will be implemented by the Foreign Economic Cooperation \nCenter  of  the  PRC  Ministry  of  Agriculture  (PRC-FECC)  in  collaboration  with  relevant \ndepartments in the GMS countries.11 The specifications for required hardware and software will \nbe determined by PRC-FECC in consultation with other implementing agencies of the GMS and \nADB.  Procurement  of  equipment  will  be  done  in  accordance  with  ADB\u2019s  Procurement \nGuidelines, and will be facilitated by the respective AINS implementing departments in each \nGMS country through an advance payment facility provided by ADB. On completion of the TA, \nthe equipment will be handed over to the implementing departments for continued use.  \n \n15.

The need for improved systems for capturing and making relevant agriculture-related \ninformation widely available in the GMS countries was identified as a priority issue during the \nsecond  meeting  of  the  working  group  on  agriculture  (WGA).1  In  response,  the  Ministry  of \nAgriculture of the People's Republic of China (PRC), in cooperation with the Asian Development \nBank (ADB), held a workshop2 on agricultural information networks to (i) exchange information \non existing agricultural information networks in GMS countries; (ii) discuss the development and \noperation of the proposed GMS agriculture information networks service (AINS); (iii) discuss the \nframework, function, and modules for a website to support the proposed AINS; and (iv) develop \nand finalize the work plan for building and piloting the AINS website. \n \n2.  Country presentations at the AINS workshop revealed a wide disparity in information and \ncommunications  technology  development  between  the  GMS  member  countries. \nNotwithstanding these differences, delegates acknowledged the potential benefits that would be \nobtained through improved information sharing and electronic trade in agriculture and value-\nadded  agricultural  products  that  could  be  facilitated  by  the  development  of  a  common \nagricultural website. Based on the workshop discussions, an outline specification for the AINS \nwebsite, draft work plans, and budgets were developed. In view of the different stages of \ninformation and communications technology development among GMS member countries, the \nInformation Center, Ministry of Agriculture, PRC accepted the request to lead the development \nof the AINS and host the prototype website. \n \nB.  Outline Specification of AINS \n3.  The objective of AINS is to provide up-to-date information on agriculture in the GMS3 to \nsupport  increased  exchange  of  information  and  to  foster  increased  intraregional  trade  of \nagricultural  produce  and  value-added  products.  In  line  with  the  focus  of  the  WGA,  the \ninformation will concentrate on crop production, livestock, fishery, and forestry. In the initial \nphase  the website  is conceived with  eight main  information  \"columns\":  (i)  news;  (ii)  GMS \nbackground  information;  (iii)  news  and  information  on  the  WGA  program  and  activities; \n(iv) agricultural policy, legislation, and new developments in GMS; (v) agricultural technology, \n(vi) information on cooperation projects and activities in GMS; (vii) information for agricultural \ntraders and merchants on supply and demand within GMS; and (viii) information exchange \nforum. The website, developed using open-source software, will at first include only two user \ninterfaces: (i) a public website with information accessible to any interested users, and (ii) a \nsecure  user  authentication  system  to  manage  access  to  data  entry  and  site management \npages.  \n \n4.  Initial  development  and  testing  of  the  prototype  AINS  website  will  be  led  by  the \nInformation  Center,  Ministry  of  Agriculture,  PRC.  However,  provision,  updating,  and \nmanagement of website content will be a distributed responsibility, shared by agencies in each \nGMS  country.  To  further  ensure  the  sustainability  and  continued  relevance  of  information \navailable through the AINS website, participating agencies will develop cost-sharing and service \n                                                 \n1  WGA-2 was held in Chiang Mai, Thailand on 22\u201323 March 2004. \n2  The AINS workshop was held in Beijing, PRC on 7\u20139 December 2004. \n3 The GMS comprises Cambodia, Lao People\u2019s Democratic Republic, Thailand, Viet Nam, and People's Republic of \nChina (Yunnan and Guangxi Provinces, although other provinces in the People\u2019s Republic of China may provide \ninformation where the agro-climate conditions are similar to elsewhere in GMS). ", "10  Appendix 1 \ncharge policies during the proposed 4-year development, pilot test, and dissemination period, \nfor which ADB support is sought. A step-by-step introduction of cost-recovery is proposed as the \nAINS proves its value to the agricultural community in GMS, through improved research and \nincreased intraregional trade in agriculture produce and products. \n \n5.  To  ensure  that  information  provided  through  AINS  remains  up-to-date  and  readily \naccessible to end users in each GMS member country, the provision of multilingual interfaces, \nuse of distributed web servers, and interoperability with other data services will be investigated \nfor implementation during the pilot and dissemination phase. \n \nC.  Initial AINS Development Plan \n6.  The 2004 AINS workshop (footnote 2) participants agreed a 4-year development, pilot \ntesting, and dissemination phase to implement AINS, which is summarized as follows: \n \n(i)  2005: Establish data standards and structure of database; develop website and \nrelated software; organize and implement training courses and workshops in \nGMS countries; begin information accessions to database and publish through \nAINS website; begin development of e-commerce system. \n(ii)  2006: Begin distributed information collection, sorting, analysis, and data entry \namong GMS member countries, using unified information exchange standards \nand data structures. \n(iii)  2007: Implement AINS membership systems and develop policies for information \nexchange. \n(iv)  2008: Implement full electronic business service for GMS agricultural produce \nthrough AINS website. \n \n7.  The  resources  required  to  implement  this  development  program  were  estimated  at \n$1.3 million, for which ADB financing of $800,000 was initially proposed, with additional funding \nto be provided by GMS countries. \n \nD.  Current Status of AINS development (March 2006) \n8.  An application for ADB funding was not made during 2005 but the Information Center of \nthe Ministry of Agriculture, PRC initiated design and development of the AINS website, with \nfunding provided by the Government of the PRC\u2014leading to registration of the AINS domain \nand a pilot release of the website4 in 2005. The prototype site includes the elements agreed \nduring  the  AINS  workshop  (footnote  2),  although  the  site  content  is  provided  mainly  by \norganizations from the PRC. Furthermore, the main page of the interface includes template \nentries for parallel sites in each of the GMS languages, but only the main English language \ninterface has been developed. The Foreign and Economic Cooperation Center, PRC hosted an \nAINS training workshop for GMS country focal points to enable remote information uploads by \nmember countries. \n \n9.  The pilot AINS website has achieved only a relatively slow rate of upload of content by \nmember countries. This is thought to be due in part to the interface being currently limited to \nEnglish language. But, it is also noted that information networks with distributed data entry have \nbeen observed to suffer from three major problems: access to adequate infrastructure to provide \n                                                 \n4  The AINS pilot website can be accessed at http://www.gms-ain.org/ (as of 31 March 2006).  ", "Appendix 2  11 \nacceptable connectivity and bandwidth, uncertainty regarding use of content and organizational \nconstraints in host institutions.  \n \nE.  Future Development  \n10.  The technical assistance (TA) will assist the emerging AINS program to overcome the \nissues outlined above by (i) establishing AINS servers in each GMS country; (ii) providing \nadditional training for national focal points and leaders of host organizations; (iii) making a \nformal release of the AINS website during the meeting of GMS agricultural ministers, scheduled \nfor October 2006 in Beijing; (iv) supporting short-term studies in each GMS country to collate \nand upload information to populate the AINS database; (v) providing short-term consultant \nsupport to assist introduce interoperability of the AINS interface with other existing agricultural \ninformation services; and (vi) further development and promotion of e-commerce sections of \nAINS website. \n \n11.  Specific activities to be financed under the TA will include the following. \n \n(i)  Purchase of necessary equipment: servers, network hardware. \n(ii)  Development of two additional modules, i.e. enterprise information. \n(iii)  Conduct of workshop on decision responsibilities of units and focal points to \nestablish and formalize working mechanisms and procedures. \n(iv)  A training course on information networking. \n(v)  The  formal  launching  of  AINS,  which  may  be  timed  during  the  proposed \nagriculture ministers\u2019 meeting in 2006. \n(vi)  Promotion of the GMS website, web content development and dissemination. \n(vii)  Annual summit on network achievements and discussion of the 2007 annual \nworking plan.
