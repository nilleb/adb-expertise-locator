INTRODUCTION \n \n1.  The knowledge and support technical assistance (TA) aims to widen the use of digital \ntechnologies  in  Bangladesh,  Pakistan,  Tajikistan,  and  Viet  Nam  and  thereby  increase  the \nproductivity and efficiency of production and marketing systems along agricultural value chains \n(AVCs). Administered by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the TA will result in a commercially \nviable business model that encourages the broad participation of the public and private sectors \nas well as civil society, and boosts access to location-specific, reliable, and real-time information \non (i) weather forecasts and alerts, (ii) irrigation scheduling, (iii) market information and analytics, \nand (iv) agricultural extension services. Helpline call centers set up in each country will provide \ninformation on best practices to improve crop production. \n \n2.  The TA supports a key priority of ADB\u2019s Strategy 2030\u2014to strengthen the use of high-\nlevel technology in developing member countries (DMCs).1 It is included in the Management-\napproved results-based work plan 2019 of the Sustainable Development and Climate Change \nDepartment.2 \n \nII.  ISSUES \n \n3.  Of about 422 million farms in Asia and the Pacific,3 about 380 million are smallholder farms \nthat provide 80% of food in the region. Most smallholder farmers are tilling fragmented parcels of \nland totaling less than 1 hectare and cannot derive a livable income from farming. They face \nproduction, weather, disease, financial, and marketing risks. Market failure is one of the costliest \nrisks. Providing technical and financial services to widely dispersed smallholders is costly and \ninefficient. \n \n4.  In addition, agriculture is increasingly exposed to climate change and globalization. Also, \ngiven that smallholder farming is back-breaking drudgery that does not generate fair returns on \ninvestments, youth are becoming disinterested in farming and migrate, and the average age of \nfarmers has risen to 60. Women increasingly take their place, but the problems that smallholders \nface are compounded for women farmers, who have even less access to technical and financial \nservices. However, modern and digital technologies\u2014smartphones, internet of things, satellites, \nand drones\u2014offer opportunities to provide such services to AVC stakeholders more efficiently \nand at much lower cost. \n \n5.  A major reason for inefficiencies in agriculture is inadequate access to reliable information \non markets and weather. Up-to-date weather forecasts and real-time data on commodity and \ninput prices will help farmers make informed decisions on the choice of crops, livestock, and \nfisheries; and adopt modern production and marketing practices. Information on weather patterns \nand  soil  moisture  content  will  help  farmers  improve  their  irrigation  practices.  Other  AVC \nstakeholders have similar difficulties in conducting their businesses efficiently because of limited \naccess  to  reliable  and  timely  market  information.  Such  inefficiencies  result  in  lower  farm \nproductivity and farmer incomes and higher prices for consumers. Access to nutritious food is \nconstrained by high and highly variable prices, leading to malnutrition. \n \n \n1  ADB. 2018.

World Development. (87). pp. 16\u201329. \n ", "2 \n6.  Digital innovations and technology may be part of the solution. The spread of mobile \ntechnology, remote-sensing services, and distributed computing are improving smallholders\u2019 \naccess to information, inputs, markets, finance, and training. Digital technology has created \nopportunities to integrate smallholders in a digitally driven agri-food system. It is providing real-\ntime access to reliable information, overcoming remoteness and exclusion cost-effectively. Digital \ntechnology,  such  as  smartphones,  satellite  imagery,  geographic  information  systems,  and \nartificial intelligence, may help identify pests and diseases, support irrigation scheduling and \nplanning, and assist weather forecasts and alerts. Social media may help gauge public perception \non outreach programs and crowdsource market-related information. \n \n7.  The TA will support four DMCs\u2014Bangladesh, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Viet Nam\u2014that \nreflect the vital role of such technology in agriculture in their national policies and strategies. Vision \n2021 Digital Bangladesh prioritizes improving service delivery to increase efficiency and equity in \nagriculture.4 Bangladesh\u2019s mobile industry has scaled up rapidly over the past decade to become \nthe fifth-largest mobile market in Asia; half its population (85 million) became subscribers in 2017.5 \nDigital Pakistan Policy envisions eAgriculture to support affordable and quality agricultural related \nservices to AVCs.6 Tajikistan\u2019s digital technology aspirations are articulated in the government\u2019s \ndecision to develop and implement information and communication technology.7 Viet Nam is keen \nto accelerate the use of digital technology in agriculture to improve productivity, quality, and \ncompetitiveness. \n \n8.  The selected DMCs offer significant potential to improve the efficiency along AVCs with \ndigital technology. Smartphones is an effective tool for AVC stakeholders to access the internet. \nFalling smartphone prices and pay-as-you-go plans have contributed to greater affordability and \naccessibility of mobile devices, including in rural areas. Smartphone ownership and the use of \nmobile broadband have grown faster in developing countries in the last decade.  In 2018, \nsubscription to mobile broadband plans exceeded 66% and smartphone adoption was 54% in \nAsia and the Pacific. Wider mobile phone penetration and the higher number of internet users \nhave opened many opportunities for continued growth in sector development.8 \n \n9.  Several examples in the selected DMCs show how digital technology improved AVCs. \nTelenor Velocity in Pakistan established an agri-tech start-up with three platforms: (i) Good Earth \nfor farm machinery and tractor sharing, (ii) Pak Agri Market for a digital agriculture directory, and \n(iii) Pak Zar Zameen for multispectral imagery from satellites. Neksigol Mushovir, meanwhile, is \na popular digital platform in Tajikistan that provides information on agriculture systems, such as \ncrop production, livestock improvement programs, and agriculture trading. The key limitations of \nsuch endeavors are that they were developed in a sporadic manner with limited scale, are not \nlinked to institutional systems, and do not constitute viable methods to \u2018scale up\u2019 and \u2018scale out\u2019 \n \n4  Government of Bangladesh, Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology. 2010.

The business model will include approaches for national replication and \nan exit strategy to auction off private sector to provide the services upon completion of the TA. \n \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \n \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n \n10.  The TA is aligned with the following impact: agricultural productivity, food security, and \nincomes of AVC actors improved (footnote 1). The TA will have the following outcome: adoption \nof digital solutions along AVCs increased.10 Specifically, the TA will (i) improve the efficiency of \nand access to service delivery, (ii) introduce innovative methods and techniques, and (iii) enhance \nthe possibility of scaling up high-level technology. \n \nB.  Outputs, Methods, and Activities \n \n11.  The TA will be implemented in two phases. Under phase 1, the TA team will review \nbusiness models that use digital technology to improve efficiencies in AVCs. The assessment will \ninclude  data  requirements  and  availability,  cost-effective  means  of  service  provision,  and \navailability of digital infrastructure and services. Following the assessment, the team will develop \na commercially viable business model that encourages the participation of the public and private \nsectors as well as civil society. In doing so, it will pay close attention to achieving a business \nmodel that will bridge the gender digital gap. The business model will include action plans to link \ngovernment institutions for better access to weather and market information, extension services, \nand technical advice to AVC stakeholders. The private sector and civil society will acquire any \nadditional data that may be required for real-time and area-specific advice using various types of \ndigital technologies. \n  \n12.  Phase 2 will begin once the business model is established. It involves (i) developing, \ntesting, and rolling out smartphone applications and messaging services; (ii) integrating weather, \nirrigation, market data, and extension services; (iii) compiling frequently asked questions and \nsetting up networks of professionals to provide answers and technical advice; (iv) negotiating with \ntelecommunication  companies  to  broadcast  mobile  applications  and  messaging;  and \n(v) launching protocols to engage the public and private sectors, including civil society. \n \n13.  Output 1: Business model to mainstream digital solutions for agricultural value \nchains developed. The TA team will develop a commercially viable business model to improve \nAVC efficiencies in each country. The business model will specify management processes for \nsharing public sector data and information, such as weather, farm management, and market data \nwith private sector and other stakeholders. The private sector will play key roles in data analysis \nand  the  collection  of  additional  information  to  enable  timely  and  efficient  access  to  such \ninformation.  Service  provision  will  include  innovative  technology  provided  by  participating \nresearch  agencies  and  academia.  Service  operations  may  initially  be  subsidized  and then \ngradually run on a cost-recovery basis, until they gain commercial viability. The business model \nwill include pathways and action plans for key stakeholders to deliver outputs 2 and 3. It will also \n \n9  The terms \u2019scale up\u2019 and \u2018scale out\u2019 are used in digital infrastructure (compute, storage, networking) in reference to \ntheir ability to scale, grow larger over time without a wholesale replacement. What does \u201cscale out\u201d vs. \u201cscale up\u201d \nmean? https://packetpushers.net/scale-up-vs-scale-out/  \n10 The design and monitoring framework is in Appendix 1. \n ", "4 \ninclude TA initiation processes, action plans, quality assurance of outputs 2 and 3, and handover \nof services for upscaling upon TA completion. \n \n14.  Output 2: Digital applications for agricultural value chains operationalized. The \noutput will result in the development and operationalization of four digital service platforms that \nprovide (i) weather forecasts and alerts, (ii) irrigation scheduling advice, (iii) market information \nand  analytics,  and  (iv)  online  agricultural  extension.  Timely  weather  alerts,  forecasts,  and \nirrigation scheduling aim to mitigate crop vulnerability and improve irrigation productivity. Market \ninformation and trend analytics will help achieve better prices at farm gate (i.e., in sales directly \nfrom the producer) and at local markets. The agricultural extension service will provide best \npractices, and information will be shared in mobile applications and messaging services. \n \n15.  Output 3: Digital call centers for agricultural value chains operationalized. The TA \nteam will set up a call center in each country to provide information on best practices that improve \nagricultural production. Trained call center operators will respond to queries using a database of \nfrequently asked questions and answers. If the call center operations are unable to provide \nsufficient information and response, they will forward the queries to registered experts for timely \nresponse. Interactive voice response; satellite imagery; and various social media,11 including \nYouTube videos, will be used to reach out and provide advice to farmers.  Digital chat rooms \ncould also be developed in DMCs where information sharing between peers and technical experts \nthrough digital technology has become effective. \n \nC.  Cost and Financing \n \n16.  The TA is estimated to cost $1 million,12 of which (i) $500,000 will be financed on a grant \nbasis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge Partnership Fund and (ii) $500,000 will be \nfinanced on a grant basis by the High-Level Technology Fund,13 both to be administered by ADB. \nThe key expenditure items are listed in Appendix 2. The $1 million budget will not be adequate to \ncarry out the TA activities in all four DMCs, additional funding will be requested once activities are \nongoing in Pakistan and the requirement for additional resources are clear.  \n \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n \n17.  The TA will be implemented from January 2020 to December 2022. ADB is the executing \nagency and will administer the TA through the Rural Development and Food Security (Agriculture) \nThematic Group under the Sustainable Development and Climate Change Department. The \nthematic group will handle overall supervision of TA implementation, including the selection and \nsupervision of consultants, and the identification of resource persons for the workshops. The \nMinistries of Agriculture in Bangladesh and in Tajikistan, the Ministry of National Food Security \nand Research in Pakistan, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in Viet Nam will \nbe the implementing agencies. The ministries will facilitate coordination with their line agencies \nand other government agencies, such as extension, information technology, marketing, and \nmetrology departments, to access information needed for the TA activities. Any additional data \nthat may be required for real-time and area-specific advice will be acquired by the private sector \nand civil society using various digital technologies. The business developed under the TA support \nwill be auctioned off 6 months before TA completion so that the private sector can commercially \n \n11 ADB. 2018.

The implementation arrangements are summarized in the table. \n \nImplementation Arrangements \nAspects  Arrangements \nIndicative implementation period  January 2020\u2013December 2022 \nExecuting agency  Asian Development Bank \nConsultants  To be selected and engaged by the Asian Development Bank \nFirm: QCBS (90:10)  N  ational and/or international   $900,000.00   \nand/or FBS subject \nto outcome of early \nm  arket engagement  \nDisbursement  The TA resources will be disbursed following the Asian Development \nBank's  Technical  Assistance  Disbursement  Handbook  (2010,  as \namended from time to time). \nFBS = fixed budget selection, QCBS = quality- and cost-based selection, TA = technical assistance. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n19.  Consulting services. The services required under this TA are innovative and involve \nhigh-level technology, and there are market uncertainties about service availability and reliable \ncost estimates for such services. Therefore, ADB will use an early market engagement approach \nto select consultants, which means that it will invite potential firms to a conference call to present \ntheir perspectives, methodologies, and associated costs for carrying out the requisite tasks. \nBased on this information, detailed proposals will be sought for competitive bidding using 90:10 \nquality- and cost-based selection and/or fixed budget selection.14 ADB will engage the consultants \nfollowing the ADB Procurement Policy (2017, as amended from time to time) and its associated \nproject administration instructions and/or staff instructions.15  \n \n20.  The TA will be implemented initially in Pakistan, where ADB has conducted consultation \nmissions to engage the country\u2019s public and private sectors and civil society. ADB is thus better \nprepared to implement the TA in Pakistan than in the other three selected DMCs. Once good \nprogress has been made in Pakistan, the activities will be suitably adapted and rolled out in the \nother selected DMCs.16 \n \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n \n21.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved (i) the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB) administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the Republic of Korea e-Asia and Knowledge \nPartnership Fund, and (ii) ADB administering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent \nof $500,000 to be financed on a grant basis by the High-Level Technology Fund for Digital \nSolutions to Improve Agricultural Value Chains, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n \n14 Output-based or lump-sum contracts will be considered for consulting services where appropriate, with the \nconcurrence of the Procurement, Portfolio, and Financial Management Department. \n15  Terms of Reference for Consultants (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n16 A detailed discussion of the nature of the TA support is in Digital Solutions to Improve Agricultural Value Chains: A \nSynopsis (accessible from the list of linked documents in Appendix 3). \n ", "6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nImpact the TA is Aligned with \nAgricultural productivity, food security, and incomes of agricultural value chain actors improveda \n  \nPerformance Indicators  Data Sources and \nResults Chain  with Targets and Baselines  Reporting Mechanisms  Risks \nOutcome       \nAdoption of digital  By 2022, at least 30% of  TA monitoring and  Farmers\u2019 adoption of \nsolutions along  beneficiaries in four DMCs  evaluation report  3G and/or 4G-\nAVCs increased  have installed and are using  enabled smartphones \nthe digital applications  is slower than \ndeveloped under the TA  anticipated. \n(2019 baseline: not \napplicable)b \n \nOutputs       \n1.
