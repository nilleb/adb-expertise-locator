The  United  Guaranty  Corporation  (UGC),  a  fully  owned \nsubsidiary of the American International Group, the National Housing \nBank of India (NHB), and the International Finance Corporation, will also \nbe shareholders of IMGC. \n  \nRationale and  Increase Access to Housing. Demand for housing in India is high. \nJustification  However,  access  to  housing  is  limited  to  certain  segments  of  the \npopulation, such as middle- and higher-income groups (typically located \nin  urban  areas),  with  an  emphasis  on  salaried  employees  of  large \ncompanies  or  well-established  employers.  By  sharing  risk  with \nmortgage lenders through guarantees, lenders will be encouraged to \npenetrate broader market segments, where demand is equally high, and \noffer access to mortgage loans on more flexible terms and conditions. \n \nImprove Affordability. Typically, mortgage lenders require a minimum \ndown payment of 20% or more of the house value. In practice, lenders\u2019 \ndown  payment  requirements  are  much  higher  for  nontraditional \nborrower segments. Many borrowers in lower-income or self-employed \nsegments are either denied loans or have had to aggregate large down \npayments through family contributions or expensive quasi-legal funding \nsources. The proposed investment will help to improve the affordability \nof homes, as a lender will be able to provide larger loans, while being \nprotected from this additional risk through a mortgage guarantee. A \nlarger loan will reduce the overall cost of housing to a borrower over the \nlife of the loan. Additionally, with the risk protection offered through a \nmortgage guarantee, a lender may be more willing to offer lower interest \nrates to borrowers.   \n \nMeet Need for Housing Stock in India. Housing is in chronic shortage \nin India due to pressures from population growth and high urbanization \nrates. The 11th Five Year Plan Working Committee for the Government \nnoted that in 2007 there was a shortage of 24.71 million housing units in \nurban areas and 47.43 million units in rural areas. By expanding the \navailability  of  mortgage  financing,  the  pace  and  number  of  home \n ", "ii   \nconstruction projects is likely to increase. This will, in turn, increase \nemployment in the construction and real estate sectors. In India, the \nconstruction  sector  is  a  large  contributor  to  gross  domestic  product \n(GDP). It is estimated that for every Indian rupee invested in housing, \nRs0.78 is added to the GDP.   \n \nBroaden and Strengthen the Housing Finance Sector. A mortgage \nguarantee  industry  is  an  important  component  of  housing  finance \nsystems in many developed markets. Mortgage guarantees will diminish \nrisk in the banking system in India through the reduction of credit risk on \nbanks\u2019 portfolios. Additionally, mortgage lenders are expected to benefit \nfrom a reduction in capital risk weights under Basel II through the use of \nmortgage  guarantees.  Finally,  market  underwriting  practices  are \nexpected to be standardized and strengthened, given that IMGC will \nrequire lenders to adhere to its underwriting standards and reporting \nrequirements.  Over  the  long  term  this  standardization  may  help  to \nbroaden the secondary market for mortgage portfolios, including the \nsecuritization market. \n  \nSupport  Government  Objectives.  The  proposed  investment  will \nsupport Government and regulator objectives. First, IMGC will help to \naddress the severe shortage of housing and housing finance in India, \nwhich  is  acknowledged  by  the  Government  to  be  one  of  the  most \npressing issues in India today. Second, recognizing the value of creating \na  healthy  housing  finance  sector,  the  Government  has  spent \nconsiderable time studying and developing guidelines for a mortgage \nguarantee industry. Regulators have released final guidelines for the \ncreation of this industry and IMGC is expected to be the first mortgage \nguarantee company established in India. Given that IMGC will have \ndatabases that capture loan performance, it may also provide value to \nregulators by keeping them apprised of higher risk lending trends which \ncould have an adverse impact on the mortgage market.  \n \n   \nRisks  The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has conducted comprehensive \ndue  diligence  to  determine  the  viability  of  the  proposed  financial \nassistance.  Overall,  the  risks  outlined  below  can  be  regarded  as \nacceptable.   \n \n(i)  Start-up. IMGC may encounter risks generally associated with \nstart-up companies, including insufficient demand for its product, \noperational  inefficiencies,  and  credit  risk.  These  risks  are \nconsidered to be reasonable and are expected to be mitigated, in \npart, by the participation of the strategic investor, UGC, which \nhas a history of successful operations in international markets. \nIMGC will work closely with lenders to tailor its products and \nservices  to  each  lender\u2019s  needs,  thereby  increasing  the \nattractiveness of its mortgage guarantee product. Additionally, \nmarket demand is expected for the product, given its ability to \nprovide capital relief for banks under Basel II.  \n ", "  iii\n(ii)  Mortgage  industry  performance.  A  severe  downturn  in  the \neconomy  and  the  mortgage  market  would  impact  on  the \nprofitability of IMGC. Although relatively young, India\u2019s mortgage \nmarket has performed well. The percentage of loans that are \nnonperforming  in  the  mortgage  market  is  currently  at  about \n2.5%.  Underwriting  practices,  although  not  uniform,  are \nconsidered to be good. IMGC will help to improve underwriting \nstandards. Thus, this risk is considered to be acceptable. \n(iii)  Regulatory risk. Regulatory risk is considered acceptable. Local \nlaws allow foreclosure through an extra-judicial process and a \ntitle deed registration system is in existence in India. Guidelines \nfor the mortgage guarantee industry were issued in February \n2008. While the guidelines are considered to be acceptable to \nindustry participants, there is a risk (given that the regulations \nhave been tailored for a new industry in India) that there may be \nsome ambiguities in the guidelines that will need to be clarified \nas IMGC begins operations. Regulatory risk can be mitigated, in \npart, by the presence of ADB (as well as IFC and the NHB), as \nshareholders in IMGC, who will assist the company in clarifying \nany uncertainties.  \n(iv)  Potential conflict of interest. The NHB will initially be the single \nlargest equity investor in IMGC, and it is also the regulator of \nhousing finance companies, which are expected to be customers \nof IMGC. NHB will not regulate the mortgage guarantee industry.  \nContractual documentation will include safeguards to prevent the \nNHB from having any undue influence on the company. \n(v)  Macroeconomic  risk.  The  Indian  economy  has  performed \nstrongly since 2003, making it one of the fastest-growing global \neconomies.  Major  challenges  include  containing  inflation, \nmanaging budget deficits, and further appreciation of the rupee, \nwhich would be likely to have an adverse impact on exports and \ncorporate profitability in export-oriented sectors. \n ", " \n \nI.  THE PROPOSAL \n1.  I submit for your approval the following report and recommendation for an equity \ninvestment of up to Rs800 million (approximately $18.58 million) in the India Mortgage \nGuarantee  Company  (IMGC)  located  in  India.1  IMGC  will  be  established  to  provide \nguarantees  to  housing  finance  companies  (HFCs)  and  banks  with  respect  to  their \nmortgage loans.2 The design and monitoring framework for this investment is in Appendix \n1. \n \nII.  RATIONALE: BACKGROUND, CHALLENGES, AND OPPORTUNITIES \nA.  The Economy \n1.  Overview and Outlook \n2.  Overview. India has one of the world\u2019s fastest-growing economies with average \ngrowth  rates  of  8%  since  2003.  The  country  has  also  made  substantial  progress  in \nreducing absolute poverty by half, and improving literacy and health conditions. The Indian \neconomy is experiencing structural changes with the decline in agricultural productivity, \nwhich has been a historic contributor to the economy. By 2007, gross domestic product \n(GDP) growth was supported by the services sector, which represented 56% of GDP, and \nthe industry sector, which represented 27% of GDP. The private sector continues to \nexpand in India as a result of the improved investment climate. From FY2002 to FY2006, \nprivate sector investment as a percentage of gross capital formation increased from 18.6% \nto 27%. \n \n3.  The Government has also made progress in its fiscal performance. The fiscal \ndeficit of the central Government has declined from 5.9% in FY2002 to 3.1% in FY2007, \nwhile revenue deficit has declined from 4.4% to 1.4%. The overall fiscal deficit of states \nhas fallen from 4.1% in FY2002 to 2.3% in FY2007. The tax-GDP ratio of the central \nGovernment has improved, increasing from 8.8% of GDP in FY2002 to 11.7% in FY2007. \n \n4.  The  Indian  economy  has  become  more  competitive  externally  as  a  result  of \nsignificant trade liberalization and reductions in tariff and nontariff barriers over the years. \nThe trade-GDP ratio has increased from 23.3% of GDP in FY2002 to 33.5% in FY2007, \nwhich is a reflection of the growing openness of the Indian economy. Foreign exchange \nreserves have increased rapidly, from less than $100 billion in FY2003 to $314 billion as of \n16 May 2008.  \n \n5.  Outlook.  The  economy  is  currently  experiencing  inflationary  pressures  and  a \nmarginal slowdown; however, given the solid fundamentals of the economy, it is expected \nthat growth will be maintained at strong levels. Moderation of growth in the economy is \nprimarily due to external developments, including a rise in interest rates, global financial \nproblems, a slowing of the US economy, and steep increases in commodity prices. Thus, \n                                                 \n1 A name for the company has not been determined, as the company can only receive approval from the \nRegistrar of Companies after board approvals have been obtained from the respective shareholders. \n2  An investment of $10 million for IMGC was initially approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in 2002 (ADB. \n2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Equity \nInvestment to India for the India Mortgage Guarantee Company. Manila [EI 7180-IND]. IMGC was not \nestablished because the regulatory framework for the mortgage guarantee industry was never introduced.   \n ", "2   \n \nthe rate of GDP growth is expected to be about 7.5% for 2008.3 Inflation has been above \n7% since March 2008. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has been using monetary policy \nmeasures, such as an increase in the cash reserve ratio and interest rates, to moderate \ninflation. It will be important for the Government to maintain control of its subsidies, \nparticularly for food and oil, during this inflationary period.  \n \n2.  Challenges \n6.  Despite strong growth in recent years, there remain a number of developmental \nchallenges  for  India.  First,  there  have  been  regional  disparities  in  growth  and  social \nindicators. India will need to support employment creation throughout the entire country. \nSecond, the agriculture sector  has performed  weakly  and will need to be supported \nthrough  rural  development  initiatives.  Third,  education  and  health  initiatives  require \ncontinued emphasis. Finally, India continues to have infrastructure bottlenecks, particularly \nin urban areas, and suffers from a lack of adequate long-term funds for infrastructure \ninvestment. As the country urbanizes rapidly, infrastructure will continue to be strained and \nthe  availability  of  affordable  and  adequate  housing  will  continue  to  diminish  if  not \nsupported through a variety of public and private initiatives.    \n \nB.  The Housing and Mortgage Market  \n1.  Housing Demand and Supply \n7.  Demand. Demand for housing in India is high and is expected to continue to \nincrease. There are a number of trends that support growth in demand. Foremost among \nthese factors is the strong performance of the economy and subsequent increase in \npersonal  income  levels.  Salary  increases  for  individuals  in  metropolitan  areas  have \naveraged about 20% per year since 2005.  4 More broadly, McKinsey Global Institute \nestimates  that  average  real  household  disposable  income  in  India  will  grow  from \nRs113,744 per annum in 2005 to Rs318,896 per annum by 2025, which represents a \ncompound annual growth rate of 5.3%. 5 As a result, the middle class is rapidly growing in \nIndia. Concurrent with the growth of the middle class is a shift in the traditional aversion to \ndebt, particularly for home ownership. Combined with strong household savings (currently \nat approximately 28% of disposable income), people are increasingly aspiring to own \nhomes (footnote 5).  \n \n8.  Changes in the demography of India are also expected to bolster demand for \nhousing. India is still in the initial stages of urban growth; in 2003, only 26% of the \npopulation lived in urban areas. By 2023, the number of people living in urban centers is \nexpected to grow to 33% (an increase of 225 million people), which is still a lower \nurbanization rate than that of many developed countries.6 In addition to traditional urban \ncenters in India, urbanization is also expected to occur in smaller and medium-sized \ntowns. The population growth rate, which will likely overtake that of the People\u2019s Republic \nof China, will also put pressure on housing stock in India. Estimates indicate that India\u2019s \npopulation will increase from 1.22 billion by 2013 to 1.37 billion by 2023 (footnote 6). \n                                                 \n3  Economist Intelligence Unit. 2008.

Asia Pacific View: Asia Pacific Real Estate Investment \nStrategy. Hong Kong (September). \n ", "3 \nAnother demographic factor that is contributing to demand for housing includes a youthful \npopulation. With the average age below 30 years old until 2023, India will have one of the \nyoungest populations in Asia. Given that the standard age for purchasing a home is \nbetween 20 and 39 years old, and that younger people in India are moving away from \ntraditional  extended-family  living  arrangements,  it  is  anticipated  that  demand  for  new \nhousing will remain strong. \n \n9.  Supply.  Housing  stock  in  India  has  historically  lagged  behind  demand.  The \nhousing  construction  sector  has  been  relatively  unorganized,  with  most  construction \nundertaken by small, local contractors and often by individuals themselves. Builders in \ncertain areas have been required to obtain more than 50 approvals, thus delaying the \napproval process to between 120 and 450 days and prohibiting formal construction. Until \napproximately 2006, the unorganized sector accounted for 70% of all housing units that \nwere constructed. 7 The larger-scale developers active in the market were niche players \nand typically focused on specific cities. Another factor that has limited the supply of \nhousing stock has been regulations that have created an artificial scarcity of land in India. \nFor example, the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act of 1976 was introduced to \nensure that large tracts of land were not concentrated in a few hands. Land in excess of \ncertain limits was turned over to the state for development. The act resulted in preventing \ntracts  of  land  from  entering  the  market  and  inefficient  redistribution  of  land  after \nacquisition. In Mumbai, 1,300 hectares of land were acquired by the state, but only 5% \nwas used over a period of 20 years, which has created overcrowded conditions and high \nproperty costs in this growing city. \n \n10.  Housing  construction  increased  markedly  in  2005  with  the  introduction  of \namendments impacting the real estate regulations. First, 100% foreign direct investment in \nhousing and construction projects was permitted, which created badly needed sources of \nfunding for real estate. Second, the Securities and Exchange Board of India allowed \nventure  capital  funds  to  invest  in  real  estate.  With  increasing  demand  and  the \naforementioned regulatory changes, the real estate development sector has become more \norganized, and larger developers with projects on a broader scale throughout India can \nnow be found. Supply of housing stock was also facilitated by the easing of some land \nrestrictions with the repealing of the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act of 1976 by \nmost states. 8 \n \n11.  Housing stock growth is expected to be strong in the short and medium term. \nCurrent housing stock is about 130 million units and is projected to grow at a compounded \nannual growth rate of 3.37% until 2012. The Credit Rating Information Services of India \nLimited (CRISIL), one of India\u2019s leading rating agencies whose majority shareholder is \nStandard and Poor\u2019s, notes that between 2007 and 2011 approximately 4.6 million units \nper annum will be added to the base housing stock.9 This will increase the housing stock \nto approximately 153 million units by the end of 2011. Despite the solid growth pattern, \nthere is still a severe shortage of housing units in India. The 11th Five Year Plan Working \nCommittee for the Government noted that there was a shortage of housing units in 2007 of \n24.71 million units in urban areas and 47.43 million in rural areas.10  \n                                                 \n7  Karnad, Renu S. 2006.

Home Prices and Affordability \n12.  Until recently, property prices in India had increased since 1999 due to demand \nand a shortage of housing and available land. In particular, there has been a steep \nescalation in home prices in metropolitan areas since about 2005. Home prices increased \nat a compounded annual growth rate of between 30% and 40% during this period. For \ninstance, in South Mumbai, the price increased from Rs18,000 per square foot (ft2) in 2005 \nto  Rs25,000  per  ft2 in  2006.11  Other  cities,  such  as  Bangalore,  Chennai,  Delhi,  and \nHyderabad, have experienced price increases, but at lower levels.   \n \n13.  Affordability, particularly in Delhi and Mumbai, has deteriorated since the beginning \nof 2006 as a consequence of high property prices. Thus, although salaries have increased \nby an average of 20% per year since approximately 2005, the affordability index has \ndeclined from 4.4 times to up to 5.5 times.12 Some buyers simply cannot afford homes in \nurban areas, while others will have a higher debt burden upon obtaining a mortgage loan. \nSome banks and HFCs have offered mortgage loans at higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios \nto accommodate more borrowers, while other banks have been reluctant to take on \nadditional risk associated with higher LTV levels.13 Overall, and despite the sharp increase \nin property prices, housing affordability has greatly improved in India. In 1996, the value of \na home in India was about 16 times an individual\u2019s annual income.  \n \n14.  More recently, property prices in India have started to decrease slightly in some \nlocations. This is primarily due to higher inflation and interest rates. However, property \nprices in suburbs of large cities are increasing as people are relocating offices from \ndowntown areas. In general, affordability in the medium term is expected to remain stable \ndue to the continued growth in incomes coupled with a moderation in property prices.  \n \n15.  Mortgage Market. At approximately 6% of GDP, India currently has one of the \nlowest  mortgage  penetration  rates  in  Asia.14  Historically,  a  number  of  factors  have \nhampered the growth of the housing construction industry (as noted above), and the \ndevelopment of the mortgage market. With respect to the mortgage market development, \nthe legal and regulatory framework for foreclosure, titling, and registration has been weak. \nHigh transaction costs associated with registering a home discouraged home buyers. \nFinally, the economy was not conducive to mortgage lending due to high interest rates and \nthe absence of a mass consumer class that demanded housing. Consequently, financial \ninstitutions simply did not offer mortgage products in large quantities for a number of \nyears. \n \n16.  The  mortgage  market  has  grown  substantially  since  FY2002.  The  sector  has \nexpanded as a result of an improved regulatory environment that strengthened the ability \nof banks to foreclose more quickly on nonperforming assets. Additionally, macroeconomic \ngrowth and lower interest rates have led to increases in mortgage lending. Other factors \ncontributing to the expansion of the mortgage market include government tax incentives \n                                                 \n11  Global Property Guide.  2008.  House Price Increases Stall.  Available: www.globalpropertyguide.com (25 \nApril). \n12  The affordability index is calculated as the property cost divided by the average net annual income. A lower \naffordability index indicates that a property is more affordable to the buyer. \n13  Market commentary noted that some banks were offering loans with LTVs of up to 90% and 100%. \n14  Warnock, Veronica C., and Francis E. Warnock. 2007 Markets and Housing Finance. NBER Working Paper \nSeries, Working Paper 13081. Cambridge, Massachusetts (May).   \n ", "5 \nfor home buyers.  CRISIL reports that the estimated growth rate in mortgage lending for \nFY2007 was 18% with total mortgage disbursements at $25 billion (footnote 10). Mortgage \ndisbursements are projected to grow at an annual rate of 15%\u201320% to over $40 billion by \n2012 (footnote 10).  Growth rates have started to slightly slow as a result of higher interest \nrates; however, the overall outlook for the market remains very positive.   \n \n17.  Despite the rapid increase in mortgage lending, the percentage of nonperforming \nloans (NPLs) is low in India and represents approximately 2.5% of lenders\u2019 mortgage \nportfolios.15 As seen in Table 1, NPLs for HFCs are currently below 2% on average. \nHowever, it should be noted that loans offered since 2004 comprise 71% of India\u2019s total \noutstanding portfolio, and have thus not had a chance to age for long. Additional details of \nthe mortgage market are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nTable 1: Nonperforming Loans for Housing Finance Companies \n(%) \n  Gross NPLs  \n  2000/01  2001/02  2002/03  2003/04  2004/05  2006/07 \nItem   (180 dpd)a (180 dpd)  (180 dpd)  (180 dpd)  (90 dpd)  (90 dpd) \nHDFC  0.85  0.95  0.99  0.95  1.14  0.92 \nLICHF  3.44  3.90  4.11  3.59  4.43  2.58 \nCanara Bank  3.52  3.62  3.21  2.70  2.87  1.56 \nDHFL  1.50  1.40  1.01  1.18  1.74  1.33 \nAverage GNPL  1.66  1.80  1.84  1.66  2.00  1.71 \ndpd = days delinquent, DHFL= Dewan Housing Finance Corporation, GNPL = gross nonperforming loans, \nHDFC = Housing Development Finance Corporation, LICHF = LIC Housing Finance Corporation, NPL = \nnonperforming loan. \na\n Until 2004, loans were considered to be nonperforming after being delinquent for more than 180 days. \nSources: Annual reports, CRISIL Research. \n \n18.  Underwriting  practices  in  India  are  considered  to  be  good  and  are  generally \nconservative.  The market is relatively young and, at 6% of GDP, lenders have not \npursued offering mortgage loans to borrowers considered to be of low credit quality.  For \ninstance,  lenders  do  not  engage  in  mortgage  lending  to  borrowers  on  a  low \ndocumentation, no documentation, or stated income basis, as was recently common in the \nUnited States for borrowers who were considered to be subprime.  LTVs have been low \nand are at an industry average of 75%.  LTVs are often overstated because fees, such as \nstamp duties, are included in the principal amount. Payment shocks to borrowers due to \nadjustable rate mortgages (ARMs) are not common, despite the prevalence of ARMs in \nthe Indian market.  Lenders adjust the tenor of a loan subsequent to changes in interest \nrates.  Additional details of the mortgage market are provided in Appendix 2. \n \nD.  Structure \n19.  The mortgage market in India is divided broadly into two segments: HFCs, and \npublic and private sector banks.16 HFCs are regulated by the National Housing Bank \n(NHB), which is wholly owned by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while the RBI directly \nregulates the banks. There are currently 45 HFCs registered with the NHB, the largest \n                                                 \n15 Nayak, Mahesh.  2008.  Life After Bad Debt.  Business Today (5 February).  India. \n16 Foreign banks have withdrawn from retail assets businesses as their distribution network is limited and costs \nof funds is higher than that of Indian players. \n ", "6   \n \nbeing the Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC, the mortgage market leader \nin India) and the LIC Housing Finance Corporation (LICHF). Other HFCs are much smaller \nand focus on niche markets or geographic regions. Prior to 1998, commercial banks were \nnot permitted to offer mortgage loans. Thus, HFC\u2019s were the dominant mortgage lenders \nin India for a number of years.  \n \n20.  With rising demand for mortgages and growing incomes, banks began to focus on \nrapidly building their mortgage portfolios and have now surpassed HFCs as the dominant \nlender segment.17 Additionally, capital adequacy requirements, access to liquidity, and tax \ntreatment differ between HFCs and banks, giving banks a competitive edge in the market. \nSources  of  funding  for  HFCs  have  included  deposits,  institutional  borrowings  (both \ndomestic and international), commercial bank borrowings, refinancing from the NHB, and \ntheir own capital. Some of the larger HFCs, such as HDFC, have been able to gain access \nto multilateral funding, the syndicated bank market, and funds from investors through \nbonds backed by mortgages.  \n \n21.  Despite the number of participants in the market, 70% of all new home loans are \ncurrently originated by four lenders: HDFC, LICHF, ICICI Bank, and the State Bank of \nIndia. The commonalities between these top-tier lenders are access to large pools of \nreasonably priced funds, and proficiency of local knowledge on home construction rules \nand land laws. Additionally, advanced information and communications technology has \nplayed an important role in augmenting the geographical spread of these lenders.  \n \n22.  The phenomenal growth in mortgage disbursements in recent years has been \nsupported by the availability of alternative distribution channels. In the past, the major \ndistribution channel has been the branch network of the HFCs; the number of branches \nwas limited and distribution reach was not very wide. Over the last few years, however, \nthere has been a significant increase in the number of banks\u2019 own distribution centers. \nAdditionally, direct sales team (DST) models have become more popular. DST models \nhave offices in specific locations with sales agents under direct management of lender \nsales managers at that office. There has also been a proliferation of direct sales agents \n(DSAs), which have contributed greatly to expanding lender reach. DSAs typically target \nindividuals who want doorstep service. As competition has intensified in the housing \nfinance industry, several large lenders have delegated sales to DSAs in order to build \nbusiness. \n \n23.  The distribution model for most lenders is in the form of a hub and spoke model, \nwhere branches, DSTs, and DSAs focus on sourcing business while credit appraisal is \nhandled by specialized units of underwriters at central lender locations. This enables \nspecialization within the organization and improves efficiencies. The branch locations are \ntypically  aligned  with  regional  offices,  which  are  commonly  located  in  major  cities \n(Bangalore, Chennai, Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, and Pune). Given that land and building \nlaws vary from state to state, local knowledge is very important in order to successfully \npenetrate specific markets.  \n \nE.  Legal and Regulatory Framework \n24.  The  legal  system  of  India  provides  a  framework  for  transfer  of  property  and \nrecognition of title. There is a lengthy history in India of private ownership of property and \n                                                 \n17  CRISIL Ratings. 2007. Mortgage Finance: A Safe Haven for Lenders? Mumbai. \n ", "7 \nland. Real estate is heavily regulated, with over 100 laws that address various aspects of \nthe real estate sector. While the central Government may issue guidelines, individual \nstates have the option, but not the obligation, to implement such guidelines. Foreclosure \nlaws  were  strengthened  in  India  with  the  introduction  of  the  Securitisation  and \nReconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act of 2002, \nwhich improved the ability of banks to foreclose more quickly on nonperforming assets \nthrough an extra-judicial process. Appendix 3 has additional information on the legal and \nregulatory framework for the property sector. \n \n25.  Mortgage Guarantee Industry Guidelines. In February 2008, the RBI released \nthe Guidelines on Registration and Operations of a Mortgage Guarantee Company under \nSection 45(1)(b) of the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934.18 The guidelines provide the \nnecessary regulatory framework for establishing a mortgage guarantee industry in India. \nThe primary provisions are summarized below: \n \n(i)  A  mortgage  guarantee  company  will  function  essentially  as  a  monoline \nguarantee company (90% of a mortgage guarantee company\u2019s gross income \nmust be derived from the mortgage guarantee business). \n \n(ii)  The maximum LTV of a loan that can be guaranteed is 90%. \n \n(iii)  Capital adequacy is set at 10% of risk in force.19 \n \n(iv)  A mortgage guarantee company will create and maintain contingency reserves \nand shall appropriate each year at least 40% of the fees earned during that \naccounting year or 25% of the net profit, whichever is higher.  These amounts \nwill be appropriated for a minimum period of seven years.  Additionally, the \ncontingency reserve must be built up to 5% of the total outstanding mortgage \nguarantee commitments. \n \n(v)  Provisions will be set aside when a guarantee is invoked in an amount equal to \nthe amount of invocation. \n \n(vi)  Provisions will also be established for those incurred but not reported losses or \nfor  those  loans  where  there  is  a  potential  for  a  loss  when  a  default  has \noccurred.  The amount of provision will be determined on an actuarial basis. \n \n(vii)  The timing for a claim payment is not clearly specified and will be negotiated \nbetween  the  mortgage  guarantee  company  and  the  guaranteed  lenders; \nhowever, a claim may be invoked after a loan is 90 days delinquent. \n \n(viii)  The mortgage guarantee will be in the form of a tripartite agreement between \nthe individual borrower, the lender, and the mortgage guarantee company. \n \n(ix)  Mortgage guarantee companies will be responsible for verification of customer \ndata and collateral. \n \n                                                 \n18 The guidelines may be accessed on the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s website at www.rbi.org.in. \n19 Risk in force represents the maximum dollar or local currency amount of principal loss covered by a \nmortgage guarantee.   \n ", "8   \n \n26.  While the guidelines are considered acceptable by industry participants, there are \na few issues that are not clearly specified or addressed. For instance, capital relief is not a \nspecific feature of the regulations; however, the Basel II Revised International Capital \nFramework (Basel II) does qualify rated guarantees as a risk mitigating tool and allows \ncapital relief. Basel II guidelines will come into force in India in calendar year 2008-2009. \nSecond, guarantees are not mandatory, regardless of LTV levels.20 Finally, given the \ntripartite nature of the mortgage guarantee agreement, it would be difficult to provide \nmortgage guarantees on a pooled basis (where a mortgage guarantee would cover a \nportfolio of loans). \n \nIII.  INDIA MORTGAGE GUARANTEE COMPANY \n27.  Overview.  IMGC  will  offer  a  single  product\u2014mortgage  guarantees\u2014issued  in \nfavor of mortgage lenders against borrower default. Revenues for this company will be \nprimarily generated through fee income. IMGC\u2019s clients will be banks and HFCs. IMGC will \nsupport the expansion of housing in India.  \n \n28.  The primary objective of IMGC will be to offer tailored credit mitigation products to \nmortgage lenders in India, and this will achieve the following: \n \n(i)  Make housing more accessible to qualified younger buyers. \n \n(ii)  Increase  accessibility  to  mortgage  loans  in  underserved  regions  and \ncommunities. \n \n(iii)  Increase accessibility to mortgage loans for entrepreneurs and the self-\nemployed. \n \n(iv)  Stimulate the housing resale market.  \n \n(v)  Encourage lenders to bring yields lower on loans that have a mortgage \nguarantee.  \n \nA.  Ownership and Management \n1.  Proposed Shareholding Structure \n29.  IMGC will be organized as a private limited company. It will require an initial \nestimated capital base of Rs1.2 billion (approximately $27.9 million). IMGC will have the \nfollowing initial shareholders: the NHB, the United Guaranty Corporation (UGC), ADB, and \nthe International Finance Corporation (IFC). UGC is the strategic shareholder in IMGC, \nand is a wholly owned subsidiary of the American International Group (AIG), which is \nglobally one of the largest financial and insurance companies. UGC also has extensive \nexperience  in  mortgage  insurance  and  guarantee  markets  in  the  US  and  elsewhere \ninternationally.  Details  of  the  initial  shareholders  are  presented  in  Appendix  4.    The \nestimated initial investment commitments and shareholding structure are shown in Table \n2. \n \n \n                                                 \n20 For instance, in Hong Kong, China, loans with LTVs of over 70% are required to obtain mortgage insurance. \n ", "9 \nTable 2: Initial Investment Commitments and Shareholding Structure \n \nInitial Equity Contribution  Ownership \nShareholder  ($ million)  (%) \nNational Housing Bank   11.98  43.00 \nUnited Guaranty Corporation  11.43  41.00 \nAsian Development Bank  2.23  8.00 \nInternational Finance Corporation  2.23  8.00 \n  Total  27.87  100.00 \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n2.  Board of Directors and Management \n30.  Board of Directors. IMGC\u2019s board of directors, expected to be composed of eight \nmembers,  will  be  the  company\u2019s  governing  body.  ADB  and  IFC  will  each  have  one \ndirector, and the NHB and UGC will each have three directors. The chairman of the board \nwill be nominated by the NHB after consultation with the initial shareholders and upon \napproval by the board of directors. An audit committee will be established and will report \ndirectly to the board. The audit committee is expected to be comprised of at least three \nnonexecutive directors, at least one of whom will be a chartered accountant.  \n \n31.  Employees. It is expected that the managing director will be identified by UGC and \nwill then be approved by the board of directors. The managing director will have an \nexecutive team of approximately five directors reporting to him or her, including a chief \noperating officer, chief risk officer, vice-president of finance, chief commercial officer, and \ncompany secretary and head of legal affairs. UGC has a representative office in New Delhi \nand  is  conducting  preliminary  work  in  anticipation  of  IMGC\u2019s  incorporation.  Several \nexperienced mortgage staff have been hired and will become key members of IMGC.  \n \nB.  Corporate Governance  \n1.  Risk Management  \n32.  IMGC will develop a comprehensive risk management system that covers credit \nand operational risk. A separate risk management unit will be formed under a chief risk \nofficer (CRO). The risk management unit will consist of approximately three divisions: \ncredit policy and portfolio analytics, underwriting, and claims and recovery. The CRO will \nreport directly to the managing director and will also report to the head global risk officer of \nUGC located in the US. \n \nC.  Concept \n33.  A  mortgage  guarantee  guarantees  lenders  against  partial  loss  from  borrower \ndefault.  It  is  typically  used  when  LTV  ratios  are  higher  than  75%\u201380%.  Mortgage \nguarantees are not a form of property insurance, payment protection in the event of \nunemployment or illness, or life insurance. Figure 1 gives an example of how a mortgage \nguarantee would provide coverage for an individual mortgage loan where the value of the \nproperty is $100,000 and a guaranteed loan of $95,000 is made to the borrower. \n \n ", "10  \n \n \nFigure 1: Example of Mortgage Guarantee Coverage \n \n \n100%  Assumptions \nBorrower Equity   \n(i)  The Borrower provides $5,000 \n95% \nin equity. \nMortgage \n(ii)  The mortgage is $95,000. \nGuarantee \n(iii)  The  value  of  the  property  is \nCoverage \n$100,000. \n \n80%   \nMortgage Guarantee Coverage \n \n \nLender-Retained \nIn  this  example,  the  mortgage \nRisk \nguarantee initially covers losses of \nup to 15.8% of the loan, which is \nequal  to  $15,000/$95,000. \nDepending  upon  the  structure  of \nthe  guarantee,  coverage  may \n0% \nchange as the loan ages.  \n \n \nNote:  Recoveries  will  be  shared  between  the  mortgage  guarantee  company  and  the  lenders \naccording to terms that will be specified in the master guarantee agreement. \nSource: Asian Development Bank. \n \n \n34.  Market Demand for Product. In order to meet its objectives, IMGC must be \ncommercially viable to achieve success. There are three factors that are expected to \ngenerate demand for a mortgage guarantee product: (i) high levels of demand from all \nsegments for housing in India, (ii) capital relief for lenders, and (iii) credit enhancement for \nmortgage-backed securitizations (MBS). \n \n35.  First, as noted, housing is in great demand in India. Demographic trends and a \npositive macroeconomic outlook contribute to projected growth in the market. The larger \nlenders  are  currently  competing  in  the  upper-  and  middle-income  salaried  and  self-\nemployed segments of the market. Consequently, lenders have been reducing fees and \nmargins and, as a result, are earning lower yields in this market. Some lenders are starting \nto expand into the lower-middle income and the self-employed nonprofessional segments \nwhere yields are higher but, with the exception of a few niche HFCs, most lenders have \nyet to really tap this market. As can be seen in Figure 2, the self-employed market has the \nhighest level of household formation but one of the lowest mortgage penetration rates. \nThus, there is ample demand and opportunity for growth in this market segment, which is \nexpected to become an increasingly important target market for lenders. \n \n \n \n \n \n ", "11 \n \n \n \nFigure 2: Market Segments Household Formation and Mortgage Penetration Rates \n \n  \n80% \n \n70% \n  70% \n \n60% \n  55%\n \n50% \n \n37% \n  40% \n30%\n \n30% \n \n  20% \n  8% \n  10% \n0%\n \n0% \n \n  Salaried  Self Employed Contract Labor\n \nLoan Disbursements  Incremental Household formation \n \n \nSource: CRISIL Research. \n \n \n36.  Second, lenders will benefit from a mortgage guarantee due to the reduction of \ncredit risk on their portfolio. The lower risk enables them to reduce the provisions for \nlosses on their portfolio. Lenders will also benefit substantially from the reduction in capital \nrisk weights under Basel ll if a mortgage guarantee is provided by a company that is rated \nAA or higher.21 Banks are currently required to hold 9% capital on a loan risk weighted at \n75%, which is an effective capital requirement of 6.75%. Under Basel II, the reduction to \n20% risk weight would lower the effective capital to 1.8% on the covered portion. HFCs \nare required to hold capital of 12% of the loan amount risk weighted at 50%. Therefore, \nthe effective capital requirement is 6%. If the risk weight is reduced to 20%, the effective \ncapital requirement would be reduced to 1.2% on the covered portion of the loan. Savings \non costs associated with capital and provisions requirements can then be deployed to \noriginate new mortgage loans. An example of the actual cost savings to an HFC using a \nmortgage guarantee is presented in Appendix 6. \n \n37.  Finally, the  benefit from mortgage guarantees may be expanded to the MBS \nmarket at a later date. As previously mentioned, the RBI guidelines require the mortgage \nguarantee to be in the form of a tripartite agreement between the individual borrower, the \nlender, and the mortgage guarantee company. Currently, this requirement makes it difficult \nfor  a  mortgage  guarantee  company  to  provide  guarantees  on  a  pool  or  portfolio  of \nmortgage  loans.  However,  should  the  regulators  modify  this  requirement,  mortgage \n                                                 \n21 The Government has stated that Basel II guidelines will be introduced in calendar year 2008 to 2009 for \nbanks. NHB has yet to come out with similar guidelines for HFCs. However, it has indicated that it will be \nreleasing similar guidelines concurrent with the implementation of Basel II.   \n ", "12  \n \nguarantees could become an important form of credit enhancement for bonds backed by \nmortgages or MBS. In many developed countries, mortgage guarantees or mortgage \ninsurance are used in a first-loss position in MBS structures.  \n \n \nD.  Operational Framework \n1.  Products \n38.  IMGC will offer a partial guarantee on mortgage loans covering a predetermined \npercentage of the outstanding mortgage value. The guarantee will be tailored to specific \nlenders' needs. It may take the form, for instance, of amortizing at the same rate as a \nmortgage loan so that a lender\u2019s risk exposure would remain constant at 80% for the life of \nthe mortgage loan. Another possible product is for the mortgage guarantee coverage to \nremain constant while the lender\u2019s exposure declines. The various product alternatives will \nbe refined after the company is incorporated. \n \n2.  Pricing \n39.  Guarantee fee pricing is expected to be the foremost concern for lenders and \nborrowers in selecting to use a mortgage guarantee product. The fee will be paid upfront \nat the point when the mortgage is closed. The borrower will be responsible for paying the \nguarantee fee. The mortgage guarantee fee is expected to be included in the full amount \nof the mortgage loan.  Initial pricing of the product will be critical to its uptake and for the \nestablishment of benchmarks in the market for this product.  IMGC will focus on preserving \nthe integrity of its pricing model by pricing risk accurately, taking into account the full \nlending cycle and reaching the threshold return on equity for all programs.   \n \n3.  Guarantee Eligibility \n40.  IMGC will guarantee only those loans that meet its own underwriting standards. \nBanks  and  HFCs  will  provide  IMGC  with  predetermined  data  from  the  borrower\u2019s \napplication, which IMGC will then use to analyze and underwrite each mortgage loan \nthrough an automated process. Given that borrower qualifications vary by lender, IMGC\u2019s \nundertaking will help to standardize the market. Bank or HFC underwriting practices and \nassociated  technology  will  be  reviewed  to  ensure  that  they  are  in  line  with  prudent \nmortgage practices and are acceptable to IMGC. A master guarantee agreement (MGA) \nwill be signed with each lender, and this will cover the key risk issues that the lender is \nexpected to address at the time of its assessment of the loan.  \n \n4.  Portfolio Monitoring \n41.  IMGC will monitor the loans that it has guaranteed. It will receive data files on a \nperiodic basis (expected to be monthly) that include all information required to satisfy its \nmonitoring  needs.  This  information  may  include,  for  example,  current  loan  balances, \nprepayment, and delinquency data. The specific dataset for this file will be based on the \nUGC Standard International Dataset and will be predetermined with each lender. \n \n ", "13 \n5.  Claims Settlement \n42.  According to the RBI guidelines for the mortgage guarantee industry, the timing for \na claims payment is not specified and will be negotiated between the mortgage guarantee \ncompany and the lenders; however, it will occur no earlier than after a loan is 90 days \ndelinquent. IMGC will be made aware of the first monthly default by a notice from the \nlender. Additionally, data from clients uploaded into IMGC\u2019s system on a continuous basis \nwill indicate early defaulting loans. Settlement of claims with a lender will take place only \nafter the lender has completed the foreclosure process and disposed of the foreclosed \nproperty through public auction. The claims settlement process will be clearly outlined with \nthe lender under the MGA. Disputed cases will also follow a procedure set forth in the \nMGA.  \n \nE.  Risk Management \n1.  Credit Risk \n43.  As noted, IMGC will develop guidelines to manage the credit risk of both the \nborrower and the lender. With respect to borrower risk, IMGC will require the lender to \nundertake specific verifications, such as bank statements and evidence of employment. \nFor nonsalaried employees where a significant portion of income is received in cash, it is \noften difficult to assess their real income. Self-employed individuals will often not declare \ntheir real income to avoid income taxes. Thus, due diligence that includes a thorough \nexamination of a borrower\u2019s income, established through accounting records and visits to \nthe borrower\u2019s premises, may be required. Credit risk will also be assessed through \nborrower ratings from India\u2019s credit bureau, the Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited \n(CIBIL). CIBIL collects both positive and negative credit information. Historical data is \nsomewhat limited since CIBIL launched its consumer credit bureau operations in 2004; \nhowever,  by  May  2005  CIBIL  had  already  accumulated  20  million  records  from  30 \nmembers.  \n \n44.  Lender  risk  will  be  managed  through  IMGC\u2019s  lender  approval  and  monitoring \nprocesses. Through random quality checks, IMGC will ensure that lenders are adhering to \nthe underwriting processes established for borrowers. Additionally, IMGC will develop a \ndetailed lender evaluation mechanism to assess lenders prior to signing an MGA. The \nMGA will help to mitigate key risk issues through the compliance of the lender with certain \nunderwriting criteria.  \n2.  Portfolio Risk  \n45.  Portfolio risk is expected to be managed in a variety of ways. Data management \nwill be important; significant emphasis will be placed on data capture and analysis. Apart \nfrom system validations of data, the data used for underwriting will be sample validated \nthrough the lender quality assurance process. Through the portfolio monitoring tasks that \nwill be undertaken on a continuous basis (as previously described), IMGC will be able to \nassess the performance of its portfolio at almost any time. Adverse selection, which would \nnegatively impact IMGC\u2019s overall portfolio performance, would be mitigated by lender \naudits, as well as through the MGA, which will specifically prohibit adverse selection. \nPortfolio risk for many mortgage insurers or guarantors can also be decreased through \nreinsurance arrangements. At this time, however, the RBI guidelines do not allow for such \nreinsurance. \n ", "14  \n \nF.  Information Technology and Management Information System \n46.  Information technology (IT) systems will be critical for the successful operation of \nIMGC, which will be working with established, sophisticated lenders. Thus, it is very \nimportant that IMGC does not impede their origination processes. The IT system will be a \nweb-based application that will be integrated with the lender partners\u2019 systems and also \nhave application interfaces with CIBIL. The system will be designed as a true web-based \napplication having three-tier architecture with a common logon server (web server), an \napplication server (performing basic applications and logic), and the database server \n(storing historical data). The system will be designed to be scalable as the business \ngrows, including taking a load of 20\u2013100 concurrent users over the first 3 years. The \nsystem will be designed so lenders can transmit data either on a flow or batch data basis.  \n \n47.  The mortgage guarantee applications will include a strong rule-based review and \napproval system. It will contain a robust document management system and the ability to \nstore document images. It will interface with a general ledger system and have the ability \nto generate accounting and management reports. \n \n48.  IMGC\u2019s IT system will have the highest level of security and availability in order to \nbuild the business. The web application will be built with a highly redundant network \nconfiguration to ensure that there is no single point of failure. Disaster recovery and \nbusiness continuity plans will be in place. The system will have three levels of security \n(physical, operational, and system) to ensure that customer data is protected. Physical \naccess  will  be  restricted,  and  dedicated  firewalls  will  be  used  to  block  unauthorized \naccess. A managed system will be in place to provide data security.  \n \nG.  Head Office and Branch Locations \n49.  IMGC\u2019s corporate head office will be in Delhi, and this will also serve as a regional \noffice.  There  will  be  two  other  regional  offices\u2014Mumbai  and  Bangalore\u2014which  will \ncentralize risk and underwriting operations. As IMGC expands operationally, it is expected \nthat additional branch offices will be established and these will operate as sales and \nmarketing outlets. IMGC\u2019s proposed structure mirrors the regional branch offices of the \nmajor lenders. Due to the vast size of the country, large population, and the operational \nmodel of most large banks, an extensive \u201cbricks and mortar\u201d operation is needed to ensure \nsuccess in India.  \n \nIV.  THE PROPOSED EQUITY INVESTMENT \n \nA.  ADB\u2019s Proposed Investment  \n1.  Equity Investment \n50.  ADB  proposes  to  make  an  equity  investment  of  up  to  Rs800  million.  ADB\u2019s \nmaximum commitment will not exceed 19% of IMGC\u2019s share capital. The initial target \ncapitalization was set based upon the projected business volume and regulatory capital \nrequirements. ADB\u2019s initial equity investment will be Rs96 million (approximately $2.23 \nmillion). Successive infusions of equity up to each shareholder\u2019s committed amount will \n ", "15 \noccur as IMGC\u2019s business grows and certain performance targets are met, as determined \nby its board of directors.  \n \n51.  An investment for IMGC was initially approved by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors in \n2002.22 Board approval was given for up to $10 million representing an equity position of \nup to 25% in IMGC.  IMGC was not established because the regulatory framework for the \nmortgage  guarantee  industry  was  not  introduced  until  February  2008.    New  Board \napproval is being sought given that the prior Board approval has lapsed and also in \nconsideration of the higher amount of funding that is now needed and the change in the \ninitial shareholding structure.23  Due diligence was recently undertaken for this project due \nto changes in the market and subsequent revisions to assumptions for IMGC\u2019s financial \nperformance.    \n \nB.  Exit Strategy \n52.  ADB will consider the disposal of its shares in IMGC once the developmental role \nof ADB has been fulfilled and after the expected holding period of 5 years. Terms and \nconditions for ADB\u2019s exit strategy are still under negotiation. However, it is anticipated that \nADB may have the right to dispose of its investment through exercise of a put option.  The \nput price is anticipated to be calculated on a fair market value basis.  \n \n53.  Another exit option for ADB will be through an initial public offering. Should market \nconditions permit, ADB could dispose of its shares via an initial public offering at any time \nduring and after the initial 5-year holding period. ADB may also seek to sell its shares to a \nstrategic investor.  \n \nV.  INVESTMENT BENEFITS, IMPACTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND RISKS  \nA.  Justification  \n1.  Development Outcome \n54.  The ADB assistance will promote significant development in India. \n \n55.  Increase Access to Housing. Demand for housing in India is strong and growing. \nHowever, access to housing is currently limited to certain segments of the population, \nsuch as mid-to-higher income groups (typically located in urban areas), with an emphasis \non salaried employees of large companies or well-established employers. For instance, \nthe rate of household formation is particularly high in the self-employed segment; however, \nmortgage  penetration  rates  are  quite  low.  By  providing  mortgage  lenders  with  risk \nprotection in the form of a guarantee, lenders are expected to be encouraged to penetrate \nbroader market segments and offer mortgage loans on terms and conditions that are more \nflexible for borrowers.  \n \n                                                 \n22 ADB. 2002. Report and Recommendation of the President to the Board of Directors on a Proposed Equity \nInvestment to India for the India Mortgage Guarantee Company. Manila (EI7180- IND). \n23 The Canadian Housing Mortgage Corporation (CHMC) withdrew from the transaction as both an equity \ninvestor and technical services provider.  CHMC is owned entirely by the Canadian government. The \nCanadian government has altered its stance and has prohibited CHMC from taking equity positions in \noverseas ventures.   \n ", "16  \n \n56.  Improve  Affordability.  Typically,  mortgage  lenders  require  a  minimum  down \npayment of 20% or more of the value of the house. For nontraditional borrower segments, \nlenders in India have required much larger down payments. Many potential borrowers in \nlower-income  or  self-employed  segments  are  either  denied  loans  or  have  had  to \naggregate large down payments through family contributions or expensive quasi-legal \nfunding sources. IMGC will help to improve the affordability of homes as the lender will be \nable to provide loans in higher amounts, while being protected from this additional risk \nthrough a mortgage guarantee. A higher loan amount will reduce the overall cost of \nhousing to a borrower over the life of the loan. Finally, with a guarantee a lender may be \nmore  willing  to  provide  lower  interest  rates  on  mortgage  loans  to  some  of  these \nunderserved borrower segments. \n \n57.  Meet Need for Housing Stock in India. Housing is in chronic shortage in India \ndue to pressures from population growth and high urbanization rates. As mentioned, the \n11th Five Year Plan Working Committee for the Government noted that in 2007 there was \na shortage of 24.71 million housing units in urban areas and 47.43 million units in rural \nareas. By expanding the availability of mortgage financing, the pace and number of home \nconstruction projects is likely to increase.  \n \n58.  Broaden and Strengthen the Housing Finance Sector. The establishment of a \nmortgage guarantee (or insurance) industry is an important component of housing finance \nsystems in developed markets. Mortgage guarantees and insurance exist not only in the \nUS  but  also  in  Australia,  Canada,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and  Hong  Kong,  China. \nMortgage guarantees diminish risk in the banking system through the reduction of credit \nrisk on their portfolio, thereby allowing a lender to penetrate new markets and deepen \nlending in those markets in which they are already active. Additionally, mortgage lenders \nin India are expected to benefit from a reduction in capital risk weights under Basel II \nthrough  use  of  mortgage  guarantees.  Finally,  market  underwriting  practices  can  be \nstandardized and strengthened, given that IMGC will require lenders to adhere to its \nstandards with respect to credit information and delinquency management systems, for \ninstance. In the long term this standardization may help to broaden the secondary market \nfor mortgage portfolios, including the securitization market. \n  \n59.  Support Government Objectives. IMGC will directly address Government and \nregulator objectives. First, it will help to tackle the severe shortage of housing and housing \nfinance in India, which is acknowledged by the Government as one of the most pressing \nissues in India today. Second, recognizing the value to the housing finance sector and the \nultimate borrower, the Government has spent years studying and developing guidelines \nfor a mortgage guarantee industry. Regulators have released final guidelines for the \ncreation of a mortgage guarantee industry and IMGC is expected to be the first mortgage \nguarantee company established in India. Additionally, a mortgage guarantee company will \nbe in a position to apprise regulators of high-risk lender practices that may have an \nadverse impact on the mortgage market.  \n \n60.  Generate  Jobs  and  Additional  Revenue.  Mortgage  lending  is  an  important \ndevelopment activity. A healthy mortgage market enables a country to generate multiple \nsources  of  employment,  and  employment  related  to  the  construction  and  home \nimprovement industries is supported. Consumption of consumer goods also increases. \nImportantly, mortgage lending also serves as a vehicle to create one of the most important \nsources of capital for an individual or family. Capital for the establishment of small and \nmedium-sized enterprises can be accessed through a mortgaged property. By providing \n ", "17 \nfunding for  IMGC,  the  proposed  ADB investment  will contribute to expanding India\u2019s \neconomic base through supporting employment in the construction and real estate sectors \nin a number of areas throughout the country. In India, the construction sector is one of the \nlargest contributors to GDP. It is estimated that for every Indian rupee invested in housing, \nRs0.78 is added to GDP.24  \n \n2.  Value Added by ADB  \n61.  Although ADB\u2019s equity investment is small, the value of its participation is, and has \nbeen, significant. First, ADB has worked with the shareholders and the Government for a \nnumber of years to establish a commercially viable mortgage guarantee industry, which \nwill broaden the housing market in India. ADB\u2019s activities have included providing input on \ndraft regulations for the industry. ADB will continue to work with the Government and \nregulators, as needed, to clarify any issues concerning the regulations. Second, given that \nIMGC is likely to be the first mortgage guarantee company to be established in India, \nADB\u2019s presence will improve the visibility and acceptance of IMGC in the market. Finally, \nIMGC will need to obtain a rating of AA for lenders to avail themselves of capital relief as \nper Basel II guidelines. When the company begins the rating process, ADB\u2019s presence \nand its AAA rating is likely to have a positive impact on the overall rating of IMGC. \n  \n3.  Measures for Development Impact \n62.  ADB  has  prepared  a  design  and  monitoring  framework  and  measured  the \nexpected development impact of the investment (Appendix 1), in accordance with ADB\u2019s \nguidelines for preparing a design and monitoring framework.25 \n \n4.  Fit to Sector and Country Strategy  \n63.  The country operations business plan for 2008\u20132010 (COBP)26 broadly outlines \nADB\u2019s strategy in India and is part of the larger draft country partnership strategy for \n2008\u20132012 (CPS).27 The COBP and the CPS are aligned with India\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan \nfor  2007\u20132011.  Critical  areas  for  development  include  infrastructure  and  social, \nagricultural, and rural development. Generating employment, improving public service \ndelivery, and balancing protection of the environment with growth is also emphasized. The \nCOBP notes that ADB will continue to support infrastructure development in India through \ntransport, energy, and urban projects. ADB will also support agribusiness infrastructure \nand rural and urban development, and improved water resources management. ADB will \ncontinue to support nonsovereign investments, particularly in these sectors.  \n \n64.  IMGC directly addresses the Government\u2019s concern for tackling housing shortages \nas outlined in the 11th Five Year Plan for 2007\u20132011, and is within the core ADB targets of \nsupporting urban and rural development projects through access to housing for a broader \nspectrum of people. Additionally, IMGC\u2019s objectives are supported by the Government, as \nconcerted efforts were made by the regulators to develop regulations for this industry.  \n \n                                                 \n24 Karnad, Renu S. 2006.

Manila.   \n ", "18  \n \n65.  ADB\u2019s investment in IMGC expands, and is complementary to, ADB\u2019s ongoing and \nprospective initiatives in the housing sector in India. These include a nonsovereign loan of \n$20 million equivalent in local currency to the Dewan Housing Finance Limited Corporation \nthat was approved by the ADB Board in December 2003. Dewan Housing Finance Limited \nCorporation  provides  loans  to  the  self-employed  and  the  lower-middle  income  class. \nADB\u2019s investment in IMGC is complementary to ADB\u2019s efforts to help India broaden its \nhousing market. ADB\u2019s South Asia Department is planning to provide technical assistance \nto the Ministry of Housing and Poverty Alleviation to improve urban development, including \nbasic shelter and services. Thus, IMGC will expand the activities of ADB's Private Sector \nOperations Department in the housing sector and complement the public sector project \nrelated to low-income housing.  \n  \nB.  Social and Environmental Safeguard Policies  \n66.  As a financial intermediation investment which is expected to result in insignificant \nenvironmental impacts, the proposed investment is assigned a classification of C for \nenvironment according to ADB\u2019s Environment Policy (2002). The investment has also \nbeen assigned a category C in respect of safeguards policies addressing indigenous \npeople and resettlement issues.  \n \n67.  With respect to the poverty analysis impact, the investment has been assigned a \nclassification of general intervention. The investment will indirectly contribute to poverty \nreduction by supporting private sector growth and promoting mortgage financing in India. \nThe social impact of the investment is high, as it will enable banks and HFCs to provide \nmortgage  lending  to  a  broader  spectrum  of  borrowers  in  India.  Moreover,  mortgage \nlending enables a country to generate multiple sources of employment in the construction \nand real estate industries. A summary of ADB\u2019s poverty reduction and social strategy is \npresented in Appendix 7. \n \nC.  Anticorruption Policy, Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of \nTerrorism \n68.  UGC was advised of ADB\u2019s Anticorruption Policy (1998, as amended to date) and \nCombating of Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism Policy (2003), and these \nwill be discussed with senior management of IMGC (once formed). Consistent with its \ncommitment to good governance, accountability, and transparency, ADB will require IMGC \nto  institute,  maintain,  and  comply  with  internal  procedures  and  controls  following \ninternational best-practice standards for the purpose of preventing corruption or money \nlaundering  activities  or  the  financing  of  terrorism.  Further,  IMGC  will  be  required  to \ncovenant  with  ADB  to  refrain  from  engaging  in  such  activities.  The  investment \ndocumentation between ADB and IMGC will further allow ADB to investigate any violation \nor potential violation of these undertakings.  \n \nD.  Transaction Risks  \n69.  ADB conducted comprehensive due diligence to determine the viability of the \nproposed  equity  investment.  Overall,  the  risks  can  be  regarded  as  acceptable  for  a \ntransaction of this kind. The main risks identified during due diligence, as well as the steps \ntaken to mitigate them, include the following: \n \n(i)  Start-up. IMGC may encounter risks generally associated with start-up \n ", "19 \ncompanies,  including  insufficient  demand  for  its  product,  operational \ninefficiencies, and credit risk. These risks are considered to be reasonable \nand  are  expected  to  be  mitigated,  in  part,  by  the  participation  of  the \nstrategic investor, UGC, which has a strong history in international markets, \nincluding in emerging countries. IMGC will work closely with UGC risk \nmanagement staff to develop credit risk and operational guidelines. Credit \nrisk  will,  in  part,  be  mitigated  through  application  of  stringent  and \nconservative  underwriting  standards  by  IMGC.  Additionally,  UGC  will \nprovide IT systems and support, which will be critical to IMGC\u2019s ability to \ncapture mortgage data and to interface with lenders.  \nWith  respect  to  market  demand,  IMGC  will  benefit  from  the  untapped \nsegments of borrowers in India. IMGC will work closely with each lender to \ntailor its products and services to each lender\u2019s needs in order to increase \nthe attractiveness of the mortgage product. It is anticipated that lenders will \nseek higher yields in underserved markets and will avail themselves of the \nmortgage  guarantee  product  to  reduce  risk.  Moreover,  lenders  are \nexpected  to  consider  the  mortgage  guarantee  product  highly  beneficial \nbecause of the reduction of capital provision under Basel II. Borrowers are \nexpected to be attracted to the mortgage guarantee product because it will \nallow them access to housing more rapidly and less expensively than is \ncurrently the case. \n(ii)  Mortgage industry performance. A severe downturn in the economy and \nthe mortgage market would impact on the profitability of IMGC. Although \nrelatively  young,  India\u2019s  mortgage  market  has  performed  well.  The \npercentage  of  NPLs  in  lenders\u2019  portfolios  is  currently  at  about  2.5%. \nMortgage  lenders  are  just  starting  to  expand  into  different  income \nsegments, other than the upper and upper middle classes.  Underwriting \npractices,  although  not  uniform,  are  considered  to  be  good  and  have \ntraditionally  been  conservative.  IMGC  will  help  to  improve  underwriting \npractices through its lender requirements and is expected to contribute to \nthe  establishment  of  industry  underwriting  standards.  Thus,  this  risk  is \nconsidered to be acceptable. \n(iii)  Regulatory  risk.  Regulatory  risk  is  considered  acceptable.  Indian  law \nallows  foreclosure  through  an  extrajudicial  process,  and  a  title  deed \nregistration system exists. Guidelines for the mortgage guarantee industry \nwere issued in February 2008. While the guidelines are considered to be \nacceptable to industry participants, there is a risk (given that the regulations \nhave been tailored for a new industry in India) that there may be some \nambiguities in the guidelines. These may need to be clarified as IMGC \nbegins  operations.  Regulatory  risk  can  be  mitigated,  in  part,  by  the \npresence of ADB, IFC, and the NHB as shareholders in IMGC.  \n(iv)  Potential conflicts of interest. NHB will initially be the single largest equity \ninvestor in IMGC. It is also the regulator of HFCs, which are expected to be \ncustomers of IMGC. The NHB will, however, not regulate the mortgage \nguarantee industry, but it could implement new regulations with the HFCs \nthat  would  make  the  mortgage  guarantee  product  more  attractive. \nConversely,  NHB  could  increase  the  risk  profile  of  IMGC  through  the \nintroduction  of  regulations  that  would  effectively  encourage  HFCs  to \n ", "20  \n \nadversely select only the most risky mortgage loans. To mitigate potential \nconflicts of interest, UGC will have a significant role in IMGC with the right \nto appoint a managing director (subject to board approval). The risk for \nadverse selection will be mitigated through the MGA with the lender, which \nwill seek to exclude demands arising as a result of adverse selection. \nCompliance will be confirmed through IMGC random audits of lenders. \nFinally, IMGC\u2019s governance structure will include safeguards to prevent the \nNHB from having any undue influence on the company, and the NHB will be \nrequested to covenant that it will not hold more than 49% of IMGC\u2019s shares. \n(v)  Macroeconomic risk. The Indian economy has performed strongly since \n2003,  making  it  one  of  the  fastest-growing  global  economies.  Major \nchallenges  include  containing  inflation,  managing  budget  deficits,  and \nfurther appreciation of the rupee, which would be likely to have an adverse \nimpact on exports and corporate profitability in export-oriented sectors. \nVI.  EXPOSURE LIMITS \n70.  Once approved by the Board, the equity investment will represent 0.36% of ADB\u2019s \ntotal nonsovereign exposure, and increase ADB\u2019s exposure in the nonbanking financial \nsubsector to 3.42%. ADB\u2019s nonsovereign exposure in India following approval of the equity \ninvestment  will  be  $1.12  billion.  The  proposed  equity  investment  is  within  ADB\u2019s \naggregate, country, industry, group, and single-project exposure limits for nonsovereign \noperations. \nVII.  ASSURANCES \n71.  Following the approval of the proposed investments by ADB\u2019s Board of Directors, \nADB  will  enter  into  suitable  investment  documentation,  and  ensure  that  such \ndocumentation will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to ADB and consistent with all \nrelevant ADB policies.  \n \n72.  Consistent with the Agreement Establishing the Asian Development Bank, the \nGovernment of India will be requested to confirm that it has no objection to the proposed \nequity  investment  in  IMGC.  No  funding  will  be  disbursed  until  ADB  receives  such \nconfirmation. \n \nVIII.  RECOMMENDATION \n73.  I am satisfied that the proposed equity investment would comply with the Articles of \nAgreement of the Asian Development Bank and recommend that the Board approve the \nequity investment of up to Rs800 million to the India Mortgage Guarantee Company from \nADB\u2019s  ordinary  capital  resources,  on  terms  and  conditions  as  are  substantially  in \naccordance with those set forth in this report, and as may be reported to the Board. \n \n \n \nHaruhiko Kuroda \n                  President \n \n01 August 2008 \n  \n ", "Appendix  1  21 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance Targets  Data Sources and/or   \nSummary  and/or Indicators  Reporting Mechanisms   Assumptions and Risks \nImpact      Assumptions \nA broader spectrum of  Provision of guarantees for  IMGC financial reports,  \u2022 Increased access to mortgage \nborrowers in India will have  approximately 220,000  Reserve Bank of India,  finance from banks, leading to \naccess to housing on a  borrowers during the first 5  National Housing Bank of  more individuals receiving \nmore affordable basis.  years of the India Mortgage  India  mortgage loans thereby \n   Guarantee Company\u2019s  stimulating the supply of housing \n(IMGC) operations    in the economy \n  \u2022 Stable or increased economic \ngrowth in India \n \nRisks \n\u2022 Construction of housing units \nslows \n\u2022 Employment and income levels \ndecrease in the country and \ninterest rates increase markedly \nOutcome      Assumptions \nMortgage lenders will be  Increase of 10% in  IMGC reports, Reserve Bank  \u2022 Demand for mortgage loans from \nmore inclined to move down  mortgage lending to  of India, National Housing  individuals continues \nmarket with mortgage  untapped market segments  Bank of India  \u2022 Property prices do not to escalate \nguarantees that shift some  (nonsalaried self-employed  substantially \nrisk of borrower default to  and lower-tier salaried  \u2022 No adverse economic \nIMGC.  employees) over the next 5  developments occur in India \n  years for those lenders  \u2022 No adverse regulatory changes \n  utilizing mortgage  affect the financial sector \n  guarantees  \u2022 No adverse regulatory changes \n   \naffect the legal and regulatory \nMortgage lenders will have  Increase of mortgage  framework governing the property \nincreased capital for more  lending of 10% per annum \nsector or the mortgage guarantee \nlending activities because  over the next 5 years for  industry  \nmortgage guarantees give  those lenders utilizing \ncapital relief under Basel II.  mortgage guarantees \n \nOutputs       Assumptions \n1.

Nonperforming  Loans.  In  India,  an  asset  is  considered  nonperforming  when  the \nborrower fails to pay one or more installment of principal and interest within 90 days of the last \ndate on which that installment was due to be paid to the lender. Despite the rapid increase in \nmortgage lending, nonperforming loans (NPLs) are low in India and are at approximately 2.5% of \nlenders\u2019  portfolios.  As  seen  in  Table  A2,  NPLs  for  housing  finance  companies  (HFCs)  are \ncurrently below 2% on average. However, loans offered over the last 3 years account for 71% of \nIndia\u2019s total outstanding portfolio, and have thus not aged. \n \nTable A2: Nonperforming Loans for Housing Finance Companies \n(%) \n  Gross NPLs  \n  FY2001  FY2002  FY2003  FY2004  FY2005  FY2007 \nItem   (180 dpd)a (180 dpd)  (180 dpd)  (180 dpd)  (90 dpd)  (90 dpd) \nHDFC  0.85  0.95  0.99  0.95  1.14  0.92 \nLICHF  3.44  3.90  4.11  3.59  4.43  2.58 \nCanara Bank  3.52  3.62  3.21  2.70  2.87  1.56 \nDHFL  1.50  1.40  1.01  1.18  1.74  1.33 \nAverage GNPL  1.66  1.80  1.84  1.66  2.00  1.71 \na  Until 2004, loans were considered to be nonperforming after being delinquent for more than 180 days. \nDHFL= Dewan Housing Finance Corporation, GNPL = gross nonperforming loans, HDFC = Housing Development \nFinance Corporation, LICHF = LIC Housing Finance Corporation, NPL = nonperforming loan. \nSources: Annual reports, CRISIL Research. \n \n \n2.  Loan Products. Mortgage lenders offer loans on fixed and floating rate (adjustable rate \nmortgage) bases. The interest rate charged on an adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) is linked to the \nbenchmark prime lending rate of the bank or the HFC. The rate changes depending on the \nchanges in the benchmark prime lending rate, and frequency of change varies across lenders (on \naverage between 3 and 6 months). With the growth of commercial bank participation in the \nmarket,  floating-rate  loans  were  offered  with  regularity  and  became  popular  with  borrowers. \nCommercial banks had access to floating-rate funds from their demand deposits; therefore, they \nwere more likely to offer ARMs to borrowers to reduce asset-liability mismatches. As interest rates \ndeclined in the market, HFCs began to offer ARMs to meet customer demand. According to Credit \nRating  Information  Services  of  India  Limited  (CRISIL),  India\u2019s  leading  rating  agency,  the \npercentage of home loans that were ARMs was 79% in FY2005. This percentage increased to \n85% in FY2007 and is estimated to increase further to 90% in FY2008. By FY2012, it is projected \nthat the percentage of mortgage loans that are ARMS will decrease to about 86%. \n \n3.  In the event of interest rate increases or decreases, the tenor of the loan will be increased \nor decreased to maintain the same payment installment. This option is available for people up to \nthe age of 65. If the tenor cannot be increased, the installment is increased or there can be a \ncombination of tenor and installment increases. Given that the average life of a mortgage loan in \nIndia is 8\u201310 years, there is the possibility to provide for such tenor increases.  \n \n4.  Interest Rates. The average yield on the benchmark 10-year Government security (risk \nfree return) was about 5.5% in FY2004, and it increased to about 6.2% in FY2005. The average \ninterest rate on a 10-year mortgage loan was about 7.4% in FY2005, which represented a \npremium of 122 basis points (bps) over the risk-free return. Subsequently, most lenders increased \n ", "Appendix  2  23 \nthe rate of interest on their housing loan products (both fixed and ARMs) by about 50 bps across \nall tenors in FY2006. Despite the increase in home loan rates, the premium declined sharply to 98 \nbps in FY2006 because of the rise in the yield on 10-year Government security to 7.1%. The yield \non the Government security was about 7.5% in FY2007 and, after a further rise of 50 bps in \nFY2008, it is expected to decrease. This resulted in an increase in mortgage loan interest rates to \nabout 11%\u201312% in mid-2007.  \n \n ", "24  Appendix  3 \n \nSUMMARY OF THE LEGAL AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK \nFOR PROPERTY AND MORTGAGES \n \n1)  The legal system in India provides a framework for transfer of property and recognition of \ntitle. There is a lengthy history in India of private ownership of property and land. Real estate in \nIndia is heavily regulated with over 100 laws that deal with various aspects of the real estate \nsector. While the central Government may issue guidelines, states have the option to implement \nsuch guidelines. Some applicable real estate legislation dates back to the 19th century1 and has \noften led to lengthy litigation and created an artificial scarcity of land.   \n \nA.  Deed Registration  \n2)  India  has  two  types  of  land:  freehold  and  leasehold.  Lease  tenures  and  terms  vary \nthroughout the country. In some locations, such as Mumbai, the Government does not sell its \nland, but rather leases it on a long-term renewable basis for a fee. Lessees are allowed nearly all \nof the rights as a property owner, including the right to mortgage and develop the property.   \n \n3)  With respect to titling, India has a deed registration system whereby title is established \nthrough previous transfers of the property if the transfers can be traced for a consecutive period of \n13 years.  Documents are recorded in the land registry and are the evidence of title, while \nregistration  of  title  is  a  system  where  the  register  itself  serves  as  the  primary  evidence. \nRegistration authorities are required to verify the authenticity of the property and its title while \nregistering  a  document.  Although  authorities  verify  documents,  they  do  not  guarantee  title \nownership. Some states, such as Karnataka, are trying to computerize their registration systems \nto  reduce  inefficiencies.  The  deed  registration  system  in  India  is  not  based  on  a  cadastral \nmapping system  whereby a  map  shows boundaries and  ownership of parcels  of land.  City \nsurveys do exist, but they typically show land and not buildings erected on a site; therefore, \nencroachments by neighboring owners can occur. Questions regarding titles of property are often \nhandled by placing advertisements in local newspapers for potential claimants to come forward. \nThus, title chains (or title due diligence) can be lengthy and typically involve a local attorney. \nBanks have in-house counsels to conduct title due diligence. \n \nB.  Mortgage Registration  \n4)  Mortgages are created on property in India by the deposit of the title deeds and payment \nof  fees.  The  registration  process  takes  about  3  weeks.  Transfer  of  property  requires  the \nappropriate conveyance documents to be stamped after payment of duty and registered with the \ngovernment registration offices. Stamp duties are levied on a state level and thus can be as high \nas 15% of the value of the property (in most developed countries this fee is about 1%\u20132% of the \nvalue of the property). The central Government has called for rationalization of stamp duties, but \nstates  have  been  reluctant  to  lower  the  fees  as  they  are  a  substantial  contributor  to  state \nrevenues. Due to the high stamp duties in some states, transaction values are often understated \nto minimize the costs associated with the property sale.   \n \nC.  Foreclosure \n5.  The Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security \nInterest Act of 2002 allowed secured creditors to pursue foreclosure outside the court system in \n                                                 \n1  The primary laws that are still applicable from the 19th and early 20th centuries include the Indian Contracts Act of \n1872, the Transfer of Property Act of 1882, and the Registration Act of 1908.  \n ", "Appendix  3  25 \nIndia. Prior to 2002, the foreclosure process could take 2\u20133 years. However, the relatively new \nforeclosure process has greatly reduced the time that it takes to conclude foreclosure, and also \ngives banks and housing finance companies added impetus to increase mortgage lending. The \nprocess is clear; remedies can be exercised after giving 60 days notice to the borrower and \nspecifying the assets in relation to which the secured creditor proposes to take action. The \nsecured creditor is required to have considered all objections made by the borrower with respect \nto why enforcement should not be taken and if such objection is not acceptable, the secured \ncreditor is required to communicate the same with reasons. Upon the expiry of the 60 day- notice, \nanother 30-day notice is to be provided to the borrower of sale of the secured assets.  If the loan \nis not paid during this period, the property is auctioned for the best price. According to the law, the \nbank must sell the property and cannot use the asset. \n ", "26  Appendix  4 \n \nINDIA MORTGAGE GUARANTEE COMPANY INITIAL SHAREHOLDERS  \n1.  The primary shareholders of the India Mortgage Guarantee Company (IMGC) are the \nfollowing: the National Housing Bank of India (NHB), the United Guaranty Corporation (UGC), the \nAsian Development Bank (ADB), and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). UGC is the \nstrategic shareholder in IMGC based upon its international experience as a mortgage insurer. \nDetails of the shareholders are presented below. \n \nA.  National Housing Bank of India \n2.  The NHB was established in 1988 to act as an institution with a broad mandate that \nincludes the mobilization of resources for housing finance companies (HFCs), regulation of HFCs, \nand development of the housing finance sector in India. The NHB is a wholly owned subsidiary of \nthe  Reserve  Bank  of  India.  It  has  provided  financial  assistance  to  18  HFCs  and  about  40 \ncommercial  and  cooperative  banks.  With  respect  to  regulation  of  the  HFCs,  the  NHB  sets \nprudential norms for HFCs based on required capital adequacy ratios, income recognition, asset \nclassification, and acceptable levels of nonperforming assets. The regulatory role of the NHB also \ncovers the deposit acceptance activities of the HFCs. In FY2007, the NHB provided Rs12.1 billion \nof refinancing to HFCs. Its profit after tax was Rs1.14 billion and total assets were Rs215 billion as \nof the same period. The NHB\u2019s capital adequacy ratio was 22.58% as of 30 June 2007. \n \nB.  United Guaranty Corporation \n3.  Established in 1963, UGC is a leading private mortgage guarantee insurance company \nheadquartered  in  the  US.

Lenders will benefit from a mortgage guarantee due to the reduction of credit risk on \ntheir portfolio. The lower risk enables them to reduce the provisions for losses on their portfolio. \nLenders will also benefit substantially from the reduction in capital risk weights under Basel ll if \na mortgage guarantee is provided by a company that is rated AA or higher.1  Savings on costs \nassociated with capital and provisions requirements can then be deployed to originate new \nmortgage loans.   \n2.  Table A8 illustrates the cost savings to a housing finance company (HFC) that uses a \nmortgage guarantee. The example uses a $100,000 mortgage loan with a tenor of 12 years. \nThe mortgage guarantee provides coverage against default for 20% of the value of the sample \nloan.   \n3.  With respect to capital relief, HFCs are required to hold capital of 12% of the loan \namount risk weighted at 50%. Therefore, the effective capital to risk weighted asset ratio is 6%. \nIf the risk weight is reduced to 20% due to the mortgage guarantee, the capital to risk weighted \nasset ratio is reduced to 1.2% on the covered portion of the loan. The average capital required \non  a  loan  without  a  mortgage  guarantee  is  about  $3,554  per  year.  With  the  mortgage \nguarantee, the average capital required is approximately $2,985. The reduction in capital of \nabout $569 each year yields a savings of $682 over the life of the loan.   \n4.  If a lender were to use a mortgage guarantee, the provisioning requirements for the \ncovered portion of the loan would also be reduced. In the example in Table A8, the average \nprovision held each year would be approximately $444 (0.75% of the average outstanding \nbalance). With an assumed mortgage guarantee providing coverage for 20% of the loan, cost \nsavings over the life of the loan are estimated at about $107.     \n5.  Finally, if the loan were to default, IMGC would assume 20% of the loss at 6% of the \ntotal value of the loan, which is the projected industry standard. The savings in a default \nscenario total $1,200. The total savings to the HFC, including capital relief, provisioning, and \ndefaults, for the sample $100,000 mortgage loan with a mortgage guarantee is approximately \n$1,989. If the loan has a high loan-to-value ratio with a higher capital requirement, the financial \nincentive to use a mortgage guarantee would be even greater. \n                                                 \n1 The Government has stated that Basel II guidelines will be introduced this year for banks. NHB has yet to come out \nwith similar guidelines for HFCs, however, it has indicated that it will be releasing similar guidelines concurrent with \nthe implementation of Basel II.   \n ", "Appendix  6  29 \nTable A6: Example of Cost Savings to a Housing Finance Company \n \nItem   Cost Savings\nCapital Relief \nCurrent capital to risk-weighted asset ratio (CRAR)  6%\nCRAR with guarantee (assuming Basel II applies)  1.20%\n \nAverage capital required annually without mortgage guaranteea $3,554 \nAverage capital required annually with mortgage guaranteeb $2,985 \nAverage savings annually by using mortgage guarantee    $569 \nYield on capitalc   10%\nCapital cost savings over 12 years   (A)                               $682 \n \nSavings on Provisions \nProvisions held at mortgage origination without mortgage guaranteed $444 \nProvisions held at mortgage origination with mortgage guaranteee $355\nSavings on provisions over 12 yearsf   (B)  $107 \n \nSavings for HFC in Default Scenario \nUltimate claim rateg   6%\nMortgage guarantee coverage                                                                      20%\nProbable claim on loan  (C)                                      $1,200.00 \n \nTotal benefit (A) + (B) + (C) or about 2% on the $100,000 loan                             $1,989 \na The average annual outstanding balance of the sample loan is $59,227.

POVERTY ANALYSIS AND STRATEGY \nA.  Linkages to the National Poverty Reduction Strategy and Country Partnership Strategy  \n \n1.  Based on the country poverty assessment, the country partnership strategy, and the sector analysis, describe how \nthe project would directly or indirectly contribute to poverty reduction and how it is linked to the poverty reduction \nstrategy of the partner country. \n \nThe project will contribute to the country\u2019s efforts to meet a substantial need for housing. There is a shortage of \nhousing in India, particularly for lower-middle income and lower-income classes. Housing conditions in urban areas are \nproblematic. The project will increase access to affordable and long-term individual housing loans by providing \nguarantees to banks making such loans.   \n \nThe country operations business plan for 2008\u20132010 (COBP)30 broadly outlines the strategy of the Asian Development \nBank (ADB) in India and is part of the larger draft country partnership strategy for 2008\u20132012 (CPS).31 The COBP and \nthe CPS are aligned with India\u2019s 11th Five Year Plan for 2007\u20132011. Critical areas for development include infrastructure \nand social,  agricultural, and rural development. Generating  employment, improving public service delivery, and \nbalancing protection of the environment with economic growth is also emphasized. The COBP notes that ADB will \ncontinue to support infrastructure development in India through transport, energy, and urban projects. ADB will also \nsupport agribusiness infrastructure, rural and urban development, and improved water resources management. ADB \nwill continue to support nonsovereign investments, particularly in these sectors.   \n \nThe proposed project directly addresses the Government\u2019s concern for addressing housing shortages as outlined in \nthe 11th Five Year Plan for 2007\u20132011 and is within the core ADB targets of supporting urban and rural development \nprojects through access to housing for a broader spectrum of people. Additionally, the project is supported by the \nGovernment, as concerted efforts were made by the regulators to develop regulations for this industry. \n \nB.  Poverty Analysis                                                                  Targeting Classification: General intervention \n1.  Key Issues  \nWhile India\u2019s poverty rate has decreased from 36% in FY1994 to 27.5% in FY2005, the pace of reduction is less than 1% \nper annum.a In absolute terms, nearly 302 million people remain below the poverty line. The project will indirectly \ncontribute  to  poverty  reduction  by  supporting  private  sector  growth  and  promoting  mortgage  financing  and \naccessibility to housing in India. ADB\u2019s support of this project will not only advance the country\u2019s infrastructure \nupgrading efforts but also lessen future public debt burden. By reducing the strain on the Government, more resources \ncan be allocated for poverty reduction purposes.  \n \n2.  Design Features.  \nThe proceeds of the equity investment will be used to establish the India Mortgage Guarantee Company, which will \nprovide guarantees for mortgage lenders who will then be able to expand their lending to a wider population base.
