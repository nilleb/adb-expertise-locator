In  January  2005,  the  Government  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  requested  the  Asian \nDevelopment Bank (ADB) to assist in developing the capacity of oblasts to monitor and evaluate \nthe results of the second National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS-II).1 It will be in line with \ninternational financial institutions\u2019 ongoing support for and active participation in preparing the \nNPRS-II, which includes monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of the results during the early part of \nits  implementation.  It  will  also  continue  ADB  assistance  in  various  poverty  reduction \ninterventions.2 The  concept  paper  for  the  technical  assistance  (TA)  was  approved  on  9 \nDecember  2004  with  financing  from  the  Cooperation  Fund  in  Support  of  Managing  for \nDevelopment Results (MfDRCF).3 Fact-finding for the TA was undertaken in early 2005 to \ndiscuss  the  TA  objectives,  scope,  financing,  and  implementation  arrangements  with  the \nGovernment. Given the political changes in March 2005, consultations were held with the \nGovernment to update and refine the TA scope.4 The design and monitoring framework is in \nAppendix 1. \nII.  ISSUES \n2.  The Kyrgyz Republic adopted a comprehensive development framework (CDF) for a \nlong-term strategic development vision until 2010, and the National Poverty Reduction Strategy \n(NPRS) 2003\u20132005 for accomplishing key Millennium Development Goals. In 2004, a central \nM&E system was established to assess (i) the progress of implementation of the CDF and \nNPRS, (ii) efficiency of use of the resources, and (iii) the output and impact of activities financed \nunder the development budget. The central M&E system was seriously damaged during looting \nof the Administration of the President (AP) of the Kyrgyz Republic and political upheaval in \nMarch  2005,  which  led  to  a  change  of  government.  The  new  Government  appointed  in \nMarch 2005 declared poverty reduction and the fight against corruption as its main policy \nobjectives. As the mandate of the first NPRS ended in 2005, the Government is currently \ndeveloping the NPRS-II for 2006\u20132010.5 An initial assessment of the first NPRS identified the \nneed for an effective central and oblast monitoring mechanism. Upon the Government\u2019s request, \nADB approved an advisory TA for Support to the Development and Implementation of the \nNational Poverty Reduction Strategy II  (SDINPRS-II)6 on 29 November 2005 to develop an \nanalytical and institutional framework to prepare and implement the NPRS-II. Particularly, the \npurpose was to restore and refine the central M&E system and develop key indicators, strategy, \nand  mechanisms  to  track the progress  of  the NPRS.  AP\u2019s Strategic  Development Unit is \ncoordinating the efforts of different government agencies to implement and monitor the CDF and \nNPRS. \n                                                 \n1  The TA was not listed in the country strategy and program (ADB. 2003. Country Strategy and Program [2004\u2013\n2006]: Kyrgyz Republic. Manila) but was requested separately by the Government. \n2  ADB. 2000. Technical Assistance to the Kyrgyz Republic for Support to the National Strategy for Poverty \nReduction. Manila. \n3  MfDRCF is funded by the governments of Canada, the Netherlands, and Norway. \n4  The TA first appeared in ADB Business Opportunities on 5 April 2006. \n5  The first draft NPRS-II will be developed by the end of June 2006. Approval is expected in September\u2013\nOctober 2006. \n6  ADB. 2005. Technical Assistance for Support to the Development and Implementation of the National Poverty \nReduction Strategy II. Manila. The TA became effective on 27 December 2005. Selection of consultants is \nongoing. The main outputs of the TA will be (i) sector and thematic studies; (ii) revival of the monitoring and \nevaluation system at the central level; (iii) better public awareness; and (iv) stronger capacity to plan, monitor, and \nevaluate NPRS-II. \n ", "2   \n3.  The  National  Statistics  Committee  (NSC)7 and  other  government  agencies  conduct \nregular and ad hoc surveys of social and economic development, depending on needs and \navailability  of  resources.  However,  surveys  have  not  and  cannot  provide  the  basis  for  a \ncomprehensive  results-based  analysis  of  progress  in  the  local  implementation  of  poverty \nreduction initiatives because (i) the first NPRS lacked adequate results-focused indicators and \ninstitutionalized  participatory  monitoring  mechanisms;  and  (ii)  NPRS-II  will  require  new \nmethodologies and additional data. In addition, unclear roles and relationships among various \nagencies weaken the institutional structure for M&E. These problems need to be addressed \nthrough capacity building, and establishing and institutionalizing an effective mechanism for \ncoordination among relevant stakeholders at all levels. In this regard, the Government has \nsought TA to help develop (i) oblast monitorable indicators and methodology, and (ii) a clear \nmechanism for oblast data collection and analysis. The Government will institute monitoring \ncenters at each oblast NSC\u2019s units to lead the monitoring process. \n4.  One of the key objectives of the CDF and NPRS is to decentralize administration. In line \nwith  this,  more  responsibilities  are  being  transferred  to  (i)  local  bodies  in  local  asset \nmanagement, and (ii) oblast administrations in implementing poverty reduction programs. The \nGovernment promulgated new legislation to devolve powers to local bodies.8 Although this \nprovides a good legal and political basis for promoting a participatory development process, \nlocal capacities are inadequate to carry forward these objectives effectively. There is no system \nfor (i) assessing and monitoring development results, and (ii) analyzing the impact of local \ninterventions  for  development  and  poverty  reduction.  The  capacity  of  local  and  central \ngovernments to measure progress and ensure the effectiveness of development and poverty \nreduction strategies is weakened by evident gaps in focusing on achieving results, mainly due to \nlimited knowledge of results-based management principles and technique. To operationalize the \nupcoming NPRS-II at oblast level, there is a need to (i) develop local knowledge in Managing for \nDevelopment  Results  (MfDR)  approaches  and  systems,  and  (ii)  help  establish  a  local \nmechanism for results-based M&E. \n5.  Results-based M&E under MfDR requires effective interaction among key stakeholders \nto  ensure  regular  feedback  for  streamlining  and  strengthening  poverty  reduction  and \ndevelopment interventions. Recognizing the need for strong dialogue between government \nagencies and civil society, the Government established oblast resource centers (ORCs) at \noblast administrations in 2002 to facilitate effective consultation with civil society.9 However, \noblasts\u2019 capacity to develop and mainstream participatory approaches into the M&E process \nhas been limited. There is a need to establish a monitoring system that combines participatory \nexercises with traditional surveys and statistics using ORCs as focal points. ORCs need to be \nstrengthened and institutionalized to ensure effective and timely feedback on implementation of \nthe NPRS-II, and help the Government track local poverty and development trends.  \n6.  ADB and other international financial institutions have substantial operational presence \nin all seven oblasts, with a number of completed, ongoing, and planned projects covering \nvarious  sectors.

In this context, the \nproposed TA would help in results-based monitoring and assessment of the implementation of \nthe upcoming joint country support strategy and ADB\u2019s MfDR framework in the Kyrgyz Republic. \nIII.  THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE \nA.  Impact and Outcome \n7.  The TA will strengthen the Government\u2019s capacity for results-based monitoring of the \nimplementation of the NPRS-II. The main TA outcome will be an established M&E system at the \noblast level, integrated  with  the national NPRS-II  M&E  system,  with clearly defined roles, \nresponsibilities, and relationships among the stakeholders.11 The main outputs of the TA will be \n(i) approved and operative oblast-specific results-focused M&E indicators, methodology, and a \nparticipatory  framework  for  all  stakeholders  integrated  into  the  national  M&E  system; \n(ii) established and operational oblast monitoring centers; and (iii) government officials familiar \nwith MfDR and M&E approaches and their application in planning, implementing, and monitoring \ndevelopment strategies. \nB.  Methodology and Key Activities \n8.  The TA is part of ADB\u2019s continuing support to the Kyrgyz Republic in designing and \nimplementing various instruments to reduce poverty. In 2000, ADB supported the development \nof the first NPRS,12 and provided economic and social policy advice to the AP.13 In 2002, the \nWorld Bank provided TA to the Government for establishing ORCs. Currently, ADB, Swiss \nAgency for Development and Cooperation, United Nations, and the World Bank are supporting \nthe Government in preparing the NPRS-II. According to an agreed collaborative division of labor, \nADB will assist in developing a comprehensive M&E system. By helping establish oblast M&E \nfacilities and results-based M&E capacity, the TA will complement ADB and aid agencies\u2019 \nassistance in various interventions for reducing poverty. The TA is based on the following \nprinciples: (i) it builds on lessons learned from the first NPRS; and (ii) it will supplement the \noutputs of the M&E component of SDINPRS-II, with the possibility of refining and fine-tuning its \nactivities as development of the NPRS-II progresses. \n9.  The TA will have the following three interrelated components. \n(i)  Development  of  results-focused  M&E  indicators  and  methodology. This \ncomponent  will  (a)  develop  oblast-specific  results-focused  indicators  by \nincorporating lower-level local needs into national level indicators to measure \ntrends  and  track  progress  on  implementation  of  the  NPRS-II;  (b)  develop \nmethodology for collecting, processing, and analyzing the results of the indicators \nand reporting formats; and (c) define the roles of the associated agencies and \ninstitutionalize the framework for stakeholders\u2019 participation in the M&E process. \n                                                 \n11 Including oblast NSC units, oblast administrations, government agencies, civil society organizations, the private \nsector, and development partners. \n12 ADB. 2000.

This component will (a) establish \nseven oblast monitoring centers (OMCs), one at each oblast NSC unit, with \nclearly  defined  tasks  and  responsibilities,  and  provide  suitable  computer \nequipment  and  software  for  processing  field  data  as  well  as  feedback  data \nobtained from ORCs; (b) train OMC staff in operating and using equipment and \nsoftware; and (c) provide computer equipment and training to ORCs to enable \nthem to effectively interact with civil society organizations, the private sector, and \nother stakeholders, and provide feedback to the OMCs.  \n(iii)  Enhancement  of  oblast  capacity  in  MfDR  and  M&E.  This component will \n(a) train central and oblast government agencies on the concept and application \nof MfDR approaches and systems and M&E, including collecting and  processing \ninformation,  analyzing  results,  and  reporting;  (b) establish  a  consultative \nmechanism among all stakeholders; (c) conduct consultative workshops with \nstakeholders to enhance their awareness on M&E of the NPRS-II implementation \nand their role in facilitating achievement of better results; and (d) develop MfDR \nand M&E manuals and support publication of booklets and brochures. \n10.  The TA will generate interest among various stakeholders at the oblast level regarding \nresults achieved by the NPRS-II. Regular monitoring, evaluation, and discussion of the results \nat oblast level will improve stakeholders\u2019 awareness of the poverty issues, the effectiveness of \nvarious interventions, identification of target groups, and midterm corrections (if required). Thus, \nthe TA will facilitate the empowerment of oblast and lower-level stakeholders, and search for \nlocal solutions to local problems. The Government will provide adequate funding to ensure that \nthe facilities established and capacity built under the TA will continue M&E after the TA is \ncompleted.  \nC.  Cost and Financing \n11.  The total cost of the TA is estimated at $330,000 equivalent. The Government has \nrequested ADB to finance $300,000 equivalent. The TA will be financed on a grant basis by \nMfDRCF and administered by ADB. The Government will finance the remaining equivalent of \n$30,000 in kind for office facilities, transport, and remuneration and per diem of counterpart staff. \nThe cost estimates and financing plan is in Appendix 2. \nD.  Implementation Arrangements \n12.  AP\u2019s Strategic Development Unit, which is responsible for preparing and monitoring \nimplementation of the NPRS-II, will be the Executing Agency. It will ensure close collaboration \nwith various stakeholders and coordination with the consulting team of SDINPRS-II. In view of \nthe close linkage between the two TAs, the steering committee established for SDINPRS-II will \nalso  oversee  the  implementation  of  the  proposed  TA.14 Some  activities,  particularly  the \ndevelopment of oblast level M&E indicators and methodology, depend on the outcomes of \nSDINPRS-II.  Therefore,  the  timing  for  fielding  consultants  under  the  proposed  TA  and \nsequencing their activities will be harmonized with the activities schedule of SDINPRS-II. Oblast \nNSC units will be the Implementing Agency at the oblast level. The oblast administrations, \nrelevant government agencies, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders will actively \nparticipate in TA activities. OMCs will be established at oblast NSC units with linkage to the \nORCs.  \n                                                 \n14 The steering committee\u2019s composition, leadership, and terms of reference are being developed under SDINPRS-II. \n ", "  5\n13.  The TA will be implemented over 22 months from August 2006 to May 2008. A total of \n30 person-months of consulting services will be provided: 6 person-months for one international \nconsultant (team leader, M&E specialist, with strong background in institutional and capacity \ndevelopment and system analysis and programming); and 24 person-months for two domestic \nconsultants (an M&E/training specialist and a computer/training specialist). Consultants will be \nrecruited on an individual basis in accordance with ADB\u2019s Guidelines on the Use of Consultants \nand other arrangements satisfactory to ADB for the engagement of domestic consultants. The \ninternational consultant will provide inputs intermittently. The consultant team will work under \nthe supervision of the Executing Agency. The consultants will submit (i) an inception report \nwithin 1 month and an interim report 9 months after TA commencement; and (ii) a draft final \nreport 11 months after TA commencement. The outline terms of reference of the international \nand domestic consultants are in Appendix 3.  \n14.  The TA will finance the purchase of computer and office equipment for seven OMCs and \nORCs. The consultants will procure the equipment in accordance with ADB's Procurement \nGuidelines following the shopping procurement mode. The equipment will be retained at OMCs \nand ORCs after TA completion. The TA results will be disseminated at workshops, consultations \nwith civil society, and through M&E reports produced under the TA. Given that the TA will \nsupplement  the  activities  of  SDINPRS-II,  which  commenced  recently,  the  implementation \narrangements will be further reviewed and confirmed at TA inception. \nIV.  THE PRESIDENT'S DECISION \n15.  The President, acting under the authority delegated by the Board, has approved ADB \nadministering technical assistance not exceeding the equivalent of $300,000 to the Government \nof the Kyrgyz Republic to be financed on a grant basis by the Cooperation Fund in Support of \nManaging for Development Results for Development of a Monitoring and Evaluation System at \nOblast Level, and hereby reports this action to the Board. \n ", " 6  Appendix 1 \nDESIGN AND MONITORING FRAMEWORK \n \nDesign  Performance  Data  Assumptions  \nSummary  Targets/Indicators  Sources/Reporting  and Risks  \nMechanisms  \nImpact      Assumptions \nStrengthened  The Government effectively  \u2022 Annual NPRS-II M&E  \u2022 Timely adoption of a \nGovernment\u2019s capacity  monitors the  reports prepared by the  results-focused NPRS-II \nfor results-based  implementation of the  Government  by the Government \nmonitoring of  NPRS-II at central and  \u2022 Statistics routinely  \u2022 Support from all \nimplementation of the  oblast levels, and adopts  published by various  stakeholders is adequate, \nNPRS-II  midstream corrections, if  government agencies  effective, and timely \nrequired  \u2022 Regular feedback from  Risk \nNGOs and civil society \n\u2022 Poor ownership of the \nstrategy by its \nstakeholders \n \nOutcome      Assumptions \nEstablished oblast- 1.
